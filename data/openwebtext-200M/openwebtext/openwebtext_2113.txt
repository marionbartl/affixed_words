WASHINGTON – Police arrested more than a dozen people Wednesday morning who crossed a barricade and blocked entrances at the Internal Revenue Service building , the start of a day of protests marking the fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
A crowd gathered outside the IRS headquarters , chanting “ This is a Crime Scene ” and “ You ’re Arresting the Wrong People . ”
A marching band led protesters down the street near the National Mall and around the IRS building before dozens demonstrators gathered at the entrance .
Protesters blocked the main entrance for a time , but no federal workers appeared to be trying to use those doors .
Police detained 13 people who sat down at a side entrance .
The demonstrators said they were focusing on the IRS because it gathers taxes that are used to fund the war .
Anti-war protests and vigils were planned throughout the day around the nation .
At the American Petroleum Institute in downtown Washington , dozens of protesters held signs reading “ Out of Iraq ” and “ No war , no warming , ” and chanted “ No blood for Oil ! ”
Craig Etchison , 62 , a retired college professor from Cumberland , Md. , and a Vietnam veteran , said he has been protesting the war for years .
“ I ’ve watched with horror as Bush has lied about this war , ” he said in front of the building .
“ I ’m appalled at the number of civilians we ’ve killed just as we did in Vietnam . ”

CHICAGO 
The parent company of United Airlines , the UAL Corporation , reported a $ 537 million loss in the first quarter on Tuesday , bigger than expected , as a 51 percent increase in fuel costs overwhelmed furious efforts to raise fares at the country ’s second - largest carrier .
UAL shares closed down $ 7.88 , to $ 13.55 .
Unless oil prices unexpectedly retreat , there is no relief in sight for airlines , and nearly the entire industry is expected to lose money this year .
United , based in Chicago , plans to reduce employment by 1,100 by the end of the year , as airlines begin a new round of layoffs .
United increased the number of planes it plans to shed to 30 , from an earlier estimate of 15 to 20 , in hopes of constraining capacity and driving fares up further .
JetBlue Airways and AirTran Holdings , two formerly fast - growing discount carriers , also posted first - quarter losses .
JetBlue , which operates from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York , reduced its growth plans for the year , hoping to keep raising fares .
According to Everett , each time any particle interacts with the rest of the world , it splits into other versions of itself — each one following a different path of potentiality .
Every one of those " versions " exists simultaneously in its own parallel universe .
In this John Pavlus edit of a postsilence video , the 134 overlaid playthroughs represent the manifold possibilities Mario encounters as he progresses through his world .
When Mario jumps on a pipe , for instance , he can be attacked by a Piranha Plant immediately , mid-air , or not at all .
So when Mario splits each of those " others " is following that possible path concurrently .
Of course , for those of us living outside Super Mario World , there 's no way to observe these infinite parallel universes .
As the video notes , there have been mathematical proofs ; but they confirm only that the hypothesis is consistent with what we do observe .
In other words , the theory very much remains a theory .
A website promoting the town of Mildenhall has been shut down after it unintentionally became the recipient of hundreds of classified emails , including messages detailing the planned flight path of President Bush .
Over more than a decade , www.mildenhall.com received emails detailing all kinds of secret military information that were intended for official Air Force personnel .
One detailed where Air Force
One could be found in the air during a planned visit to the region by President Bush .
Others included battlefield strategy and passwords .
" I was being sent everything from banal chat and jokes , to videos up to 15 mb in size , " Gary Sinnott , owner of mildenhall.com , said in this article in EDP 24 .
" Some were classified , some were personal .
A lot had some really sensitive information in them . "
As owner of mildenhall.com , Sinnott received every email that had that domain name included in the address field .
The site was set up to provide information about the town of Mildenhall , which is about a half - hour 's drive north east of Cambridge .
Sinnott says he brought the SNAFU to the attention of Air Force officials but was never able to get the problem fixed .
At first , they did n't seem to take the matter seriously , but eventually , they " went mental , " he said .
Officials advised Sinnott to block unrecognizable addresses from his domain and set up an auto - reply reminding people of the address for the official air force base .
But still , the official emails continued to flow in to Sinnott 's site .
And to make matters worse , some people got angry after Sinnott told them they were sending email to the wrong address and gave his address to spammers .
Sinnott was receiving 30,000 pieces of email per day , most of which was junk mail .
So Sinnott pulled the plug on the website .
Though he remains the owner of mildenhall.com , it may only be a matter of time before all those emails incorrectly addressed to Air Force personnel at mildenhall.com automatically begin to bounce .
And that ought to make security conscious people everywhere breath a little easier .
Alas , according whois records , mildenhall.net and mildenhall.org are in the hands of non-military individuals and mildenhall.us is available to anyone with $ 35 .
Given what we now know about the boobs who send confidential information , that ought to give us pause . ®
The Bakken formation in North Dakota and Montana has generated a lot of buzz in the past year .
Reserve numbers in the billions of barrels , even tens or hundreds of billions show up in press reports and blogs .
Now the USGS has weighed in with a comprehensive assessment of the resource .
So just how much will this oil accumulation help the world 's largest importer of oil ?
Is it time to relax or is this just another small blip in the long - term decline of domestic production ?
We 'll examine these questions and others below the fold , using data from the IHS database .
Overview of the Bakken
The Bakken formation is an oil - bearing strata covering parts of Montana , North Dakota , and Saskatchewan .
Oil was first produced from the Bakken more than 50 years ago .
Production was mainly from a few vertical wells until the 1980's when horizontal technology became available .
Only recently after the intensive application of horizontal wells combined with hydraulic fracturing technology did production really take off .
The Bakken is one of many hydrocarbon producing formations in the Williston Basin , a sedimentary basin covering parts of three states and two provinces .
The total layer of sediments in the basin can be up to 15,000 ft thick , and within that , the Bakken itself reaches a maximum thickness of about 150 ft. , but is thinner in most areas .
The depth to the top of the Bakken can vary from a few thousand feet in Canada to more than 10,000 feet in the deeper areas in North Dakota .
In terms of geologic age , it was deposited during the upper Devonian and Lower Mississippian periods about 360 million years ago .
The entire stratigraphic column for the Williston Basin is shown below .
Figure 2 indicates 15 primary producing formations in the basin , including the Bakken .
Figure 2 - Williston Basin stratigraphic column from Wikipedia
The Bakken shale consists of three members , the upper , middle , and lower .
The upper and lower members are similar , and can be characterized as a gray or black organic - rich shale .
The middle member is more like a conventional reservoir with siltstones , sandstones , dolostones , and limestones .
The middle member has been a target for many horizontal wells , but more recently the upper and lower horizons are also being seen as important reservoirs .
For a more complete description of the Bakken , see the 2001 USGS study Diagenesis and Fracture Development in the Bakken Formation , Williston Basin : Implications for Reservoir Quality in the Middle Member , by J Pitman , L Price , and J LeFever .
Two key properties of reservoir rock are porosity and permeability .
Porosity is a measure of how much " empty " volume the rock has space available to store hydrocarbons , water , or gas .
Really good formations can have porosities of 20 % to 30 % or more .
Permeability is a measure of how easily fluid can flow through the rock .
The best reservoirs have permeabilities of 1 to 5 darcies or more .
( 1 Darcy = 1000 millidarcies : better reservoirs are usually measured in darcies , and poorer reservoirs in millidarcies . )
These high porosities and permeabilities can be found in many world class prolific oil and gas fields , such as the offshore Gulf of Mexico , the North Sea , and Saudi Arabia .
The majority of currently producing reservoirs in the onshore US are by contrast much " tighter . "
A pretty good reservoir might have porosities of 10 % to 15 % and permeabilities of 1 to 100 millidarcies ( 0.001 to 0.1 darcy ) .
Reservoirs with those properties by and large would be considered very desirable reservoir in most of the onshore US and Canada .
Moving downward on the scale of reservoir quality , many thousands of wells in the US are now being drilled in so - called " resource plays . "
These are thick , laterally extensive reservoirs usually covering thousands of square miles , and filled with hydrocarbons , but they are difficult to exploit .
The Bakken Shale , along with formations like the Barnett , Fayetteville , and Woodford shales fall into this category .
Permeabilities can be in the range of .00001 to .01 millidarcies , with porosities in the range of near zero to maybe 10 % or a bit higher .
Porosity and permeability can vary widely and unpredictably over short distances .
There are many stories on oil field lore about dry holes drilled next to prolific producing wells , with little explanation geologically about why this might occur .
This phenomenon is one of the primary risks that oil producers take when they drill wells , especially in new areas or highly variable reservoirs .
The Pittman / Price / LeFever study cited above reports a wide range of measured permeabilities and porosities in the Bakken , but the average is low .
One part of the report gives the average porosity and permeability for the middle Bakken as being 5 % and 0.04 millidarcies .
In many of these very tight reservoirs , natural fractures play a big role .
These are natural cracks which have low porosity but can have permeabilities one to several orders of magnitude greater than the rock fabric or matrix .
Most of the better wells in the Bakken have encountered abundant natural fractures .
Even with an extensive natural fracture system , often times additional help is needed to create an economic well .
This is where hydraulic fracturing comes in .
Fluid , sometimes with sand or other material ( " proppant " ) is pumped at high pressure into the formation .
The pressure is high enough to create large artificial fractures that can extend hundreds of feet from a wellbore .
Proppant holds the fracture open , and creates a permeable channel to allow hydrocarbons to flow to the wellbore .
Production in many , or perhaps most , of the producing formations in the US is improved by hydraulic fracturing .
When hydraulic fracturing is combined with horizontal wells ( and high enough commodity prices ) , many of the shale or resource plays become economic to produce .
Oil in Place and Reserves
To understand how much oil might be producible from the Bakken , we need to get there in a couple of steps .
The first step is " oil in place . "
The Bakken is postulated to be both source rock and reservoir .
Over millions of years organic matter is cooked under heat and pressure to produce hydrocarbons .
In many areas , the oil created by the source rock slowly migrates to another location where it is trapped and later found as an oil or gas reservoir .
In the case of the Bakken , these layers contain source material , but the hydrocarbon was cooked in place and little or none of the created hydrocarbon migrated to other potential reservoir rocks .
The Pittman / Price / LeFever study estimates the volume of oil generated at 200 to 400 billion barrels , which we can more or less equate to an estimate of oil in place .
The next step is to estimate how much oil could be recovered ( produced ) .
For a reservoir such as this , the range of recovery can very widely .
Good reservoirs with " water drive " can have recoveries of more than 30 % of oil in place .
As reservoir quality decreases , so does recovery factor .
In very tight reservoirs , recovery would probably be in the range of less than 1 % to around 10 % , depending on many factors like porosity , permeability , presence of fractures , well spacing , etc .
In the good areas of the Bakken , with higher porosity and lots of fracture permeability , the recovery might range as high as 5 % to possibly 15 % .
Typically only a few areas , or " sweet spots , " will have recovery this high .
Outside the sweet spots , recoveries are likely to be much lower ; the reservoir quality will deteriorate , with lower porosity , lower permeability , and fewer fractures , and / or thinner beds of reservoir rock .
In these areas , recovery will probably be less than 5 % of the oil in place , and in some areas less than 1 % .
Estimating recovery factor in shale reservoirs is more an art than a science ; only after several years of production , and with very good data , can a reliable range of recovery be estimated .
In the less favorable and thinner areas of the reservoir , even though it might be technically possible to recover 1 % or 2 % of the oil in place , the risk may be too high to for an operator to be willing to spend $ 3 to $ 5 million or more , with no assurance that the well will pay out .
In this case the " technically recoverable " reserves might be 1 % of oil in place , but the economically recoverable reserves are 0 % if an operator is not persuaded to risk capital to drill a well .
Some of the recent articles have suggested a Bakken recovery as high as 50 % , but that is highly doubtful in my view .
Recoveries that high only occur in a few really good world class reservoirs , and , even there , often require secondary or tertiary recovery techniques .
The USGS 2008 estimate
The discussion above now gives us a context with which to understand the recently released USGS estimate .
So far , only a two - page summary of findings was released .
We do not have access yet to the detailed report that backs up the summary , but we can make a number of inferences from the information provided .
The USGS summary indicates that their estimates are " undiscovered , technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the Bakken Formation in the United States . "
The term " undiscovered " suggests that the currently known reserves have been excluded from their totals .
" Technically recoverable " has not been defined in the USGS summary ; we will need to wait for the detailed report to find out their definition .
In the mean time , one reasonable definition might be " the volume of hydrocarbons that theoretically could be produced if enough wells were drilled to drain the entire known area of Bakken oil accumulation " .
We can contrast " technically recoverable " to " economically recoverable , " a term which can be taken as the amount of producible reserves that will give a reasonable return on capital invested .
The volume of economically recoverable reserves will change as oil price , cost of wells , etc. vary .
In reality , some of the areas of poorer reservoir will never be drilled because of poor economics : the cost and risk will not be offset by the expected recovery of oil .
It is true that more of these marginal areas will be exploited as the price of oil rises .
Table 1 - Probabalistic estimate of " undiscovered , technically recoverable oil " , from the 2008 USGS Bakken Assessment ( Note : MMBO=Million Barrels of Oil , BCF=Billion Cubic Feet )
The USGS estimated reserves probabilistically , as indicated by the P95 , P50 , P5 , and mean values on the table above .
( P95 , for example , indicates that there is a 95 percent chance that the reserves value given will exceed this value . )
Using the mean value as a representative number for the distribution , the USGS estimate that there are 3,649 million barrels of technically recoverable oil in the entire US Bakken accumulation .
Associated with the oil production are 1,850 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 148 million barrels of NGL's .
On an equivalent energy basis , about 90 % of the energy value is in the oil , with the remaining percentage in the gas and NGL's .
Ok , so now we have an estimate of undiscovered reserves .
How does that compare to known or discovered reserves ?
Our estimate is that the Bakken has produced about 111 million barrels so far in North Dakota and Montana .
Although it 's a rough guesstimate , we could say that perhaps 3 times to 5 times the produced volume constitutes " discovered resources . "
This would include the " proven " category of remaining production from existing wells , plus the immediate areas around the wells , plus additional area that is more speculative but could yield some production .
Let 's be clear that the term " total discovered resource " is very fuzzy .
Who is to say where the discovered technically recoverable reserves stop and the undiscovered resources begin ?
Using the round numbers of 300 to 500 million barrels of oil discovered resources , we can then say that the mean USGS undiscovered resources are 7 to 12 times the size of the already discovered resources .
Using the combined undiscovered and discovered resource estimates , we can take a stab at the implied recovery factor .
If we choose the value of 500 million barrels for discovered resources , we find that the implied recovery factor ( oil produced / oil in place ) is 1.0 % = ( 3,649+500/400,000 ) to 2.1 % = ( 3,649+500/200,000 ) .
Will Bakken ever produce as much as 4.1 billion barrels ( = 3,649+500 million barrels ) , the amount suggested by the USGS estimate ?
It seems very unlikely .
Production so far has been 111 million barrels .
If the industry is able to discover several more prolific areas such as the Elm Coulee field in Montana ( 43 million barrels , or 38 % of the Bakken oil recovered to date ) , it might be possible to increase this recovery to 500 million barrels , or 4.5 times the current production .
Is total production of 500 million barrels likely ?
It 's difficult to say .
The USGS estimate is vastly higher than this , so much less likely .
If 500 million barrels turns out to be the ultimate recovery , the recovery factor would range from 0.13 % to 0.25 % of estimated oil in place .
This very low percentage recovery of the estimated oil in place is not unreasonable if one considers that many of the more marginal areas of the field are likely to be deemed sub-economic and will never be drilled and produced .
Technology improvements that will inevitably be made during an era of high energy prices will undoubtedly render some of this more marginal oil recoverable , but the total recovery is still likely to be low .
The USGS numbers are notable for their apparent certainty of the size of the undiscovered resources .
The p5/p95 ratio is one measure of the spread or uncertainty of a probabilistic estimate .
The USGS oil numbers show ratios of 1.2 to 1.9 , which is quite surprising .
These low ratios imply that the USGS is highly confident in their recoverable resource estimates .
One would have thought that a 5X or 10X spread in this ratio would be more plausible considering that 85 % to 90 % of the resources has not yet been discovered .
Perhaps when the detailed report is released , the logic behind this narrow range will be revealed .
In the mean time , I remain highly skeptical that such a large resource with an unknown variability of fracture density , porosity , and recovery factor , and other factors , can be quantified with such precision .
If we could actually produce 3.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil forecast at the P50 level by USGS , how much would this equate to ?
The US uses about 7.6 billion barrels of oil products a year , according to EIA data .
This is equivalent to just under six month 's US oil use , spread over a very long period , probably 20 years or more .
If total production amounts to only 500 million barrels , as I have suggested , this would equate to about 23 days worth of United States oil usage , spread over many , many years .
Looking at future production another way , the recent peak in production has been 75,000 barrels of oil per day ( discussed in more detail below ) .
Even if operators are able to triple this amount , the resulting production of 225,000 barrels a day ( which would be a considerable challenge ) , will amount to only about 1.1 % of US oil consumption , assuming the US uses about 20.7 barrels of oil a day , based on EIA data .
If we can reach 225,000 barrels of oil per day , the history of Bakken suggest this level would be short - lived - the peak production will probably last for a year or less - because as we shall see below , total Bakken production can be expected to decline to 50 % or less of its peak rate within a few years , because of the steep decline rate of individual wells .
Bakken production history
To understand historical Bakken production , we utilized a commercially available production database ( IHS ) that contains monthly production for all Bakken wells in Montana and North Dakota .
This database , while not in exact agreement with state data , is accurate enough to discern general trends .
A cross check of state records indicates that the total production and well numbers for the individual states indicated by the database are within a few percent of those recorded by the individual states .
Figure 3 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates since 1971
The production history of the Bakken in Montana and North Dakota ( Figure 3 ) can be divided into three phases , a ) vertical well production prior to 1985 , b ) the first wave of horizontal well production up to 2004 , and c ) the second wave of horizontal production since 2004 .
Clearly the second wave of horizontal production has had a huge impact , which can be credited to several improvements over the technology of the 1990s .
These improvements include , among other things the ability to drill longer horizontal and multilateral wells from a single vertical wellbore , and improved hydraulic fracturing technology .
The first wave of horizontal well technology boosted Bakken production to an April 1991 peak of 11,790 barrels of oil per day ( BOPD ) .
Constrast that with the most recent peak in October 2007 of 75,000 BOPD .
As a quantification of the importance of horizontal wells , the proportion of Bakken horizontal wells ( including multilateral ) , as a percentage of total wells , increased from 0 % in 1980 , to 50 % in 1990 , 78 % in 1995 , and 95 % today .
Figure 4 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates since 1971 , with number of producing wells
If we consider the number of wells being drilled , and how it affected production , a key point arises from Figure 4 .
There is distinct peak and rapid decline of production in 1991 , even though the number of wells increased for two more years after the production peak .
This is one of the harsh realities of oil and gas production , especially in tight , fractured reservoirs .
The wells may individually reach peak production rates of 500 barrels of oil per day ( BOPD ) , 1,000 BOPD , or more , but the peak is normally very short lived because it is followed by a rapid decline that can be anywhere from 20 % to 60 % per year for the next couple years .
After an initial rapid decline , the well may produce at low rates and less decline for many years afterward , but usually high well rates anywhere close to the original rate can never be achieved .
Combining many wells with this high rate / rapid decline characteristics means that it may be possible to achieve a high field production rate , but only for a short time , and drilling additional wells often will not be enough to offset the overall field decline .
Production of wells in a field is usually log - normally distributed .
A few wells produce at high rates , and most of the wells produce at less than average rates .
In a typical field the best 20 % of wells pay for the other 80 % .
It 's a numbers game - unless one is lucky enough to hit a big well on the first try , one needs to stay in the game long enough to drill enough wells to achieve an acceptable statistical average .
The field decline during the period of February 1993 to February 1997 is about 25 % per year .
If many new wells were not being drilled and put into production during this decline period , the overall decline would be considerably steeper .
Note that after January 1997 , the decline flattens somewhat ; this would be the beginning of the long " tail " period of production from existing wells , characterized by low producing rates with shallower decline .
Figure 5 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota average daily production per well since 1971 , with number of producing wells
If we consider average production per well ( Figure 5 ) , we find that its behavior may be predictive of later field decline .
The average production per well is simply the total reported Bakken production for the period , divided by the total number of wells producing during the period .
If a well is drilled and goes on production in a certain period , the well count goes up by one , and the well 's production gets added to the total .
If a well becomes uneconomic during the period , and the operator stops producing the well , the well count goes down by one .
In any given month , wells that come on at high rates of say , 1,000 BOPD , are averaged with wells already on production that may be producing 100 or 50 BOPD .
If there is a population of wells already producing and on decline , bringing on more wells at temporarily high rates ( the 1,000 BOPD may last for one month or two months max in most cases ) will only raise the average production slightly .
For the first wave of horizontal technology , the per-well production peaked in August 1990 at 71 BOPD per well , with 142 wells producing .
The per-well production then declined , even though additional wells were brought on production for the next 4 years .
In August 1994 , the peak well count of 235 wells was reached , but by then the average per well rate was only 22 BOPD .
Interestingly and perhaps alarmingly , the 2nd wave of Bakken horizontal well production reached in August 2005 a peak per-well rate 116 BOPD per well , with 433 wells on production .
Based on production in the early 90's this may portend a near term decline in Bakken total production .
As of October 2007 , however , the total Bakken production rate was still rising rapidly .
Even if Bakken production should peak in the next year or two , this does n't necessarily mean a permanent decline in production .
Past history shows that some combination of new technology , new discoveries , and higher prices could lead to another uptick in production .
Figure 6 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates since 1971 , with average well rate
Comparing per well rates and total producing rates in Figure 6 , there was an eight - month lag from the peak per well rate in August 1990 to the peak Bakken production rate in April 1991 .
As was mentioned above the peak in total Bakken rate occurred in spite of the fact that wells continued to be drilled and brought on production during the next four years .
We are now 26 months past the August 2005 per -well peak , so that 's encouraging .
That 's 26 months up to October 2007 , the last month plotted in this graph .
Figure 7 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates vs. cumulative oil produced
Looking at the total Bakken production vs. the cumulative production ( Figure 7 ) will allow us to approximate produced volumes of the two waves of horizontal technology .
The first wave production curve indicates that if no new wells were drilled , the ultimate recovery would have been about 41 million barrels .
The second wave of horizontal technology did indeed dwarf the first wave , and we can say that so far the second wave has added about 70 + million barrels of production .
The first wave of horizontal technology peaked at about 20 million barrels , with an ultimate recovery of about double that , or 41 million barrels .
Using this analogy , if the industry were able to keep up the current rate of increase for the next two years , and reach a peak production at 150 million barrels cumulative recovery , ultimate recovery could reasonably be estimated as being around 300 million barrels , without additional new waves of development .
What 's next for the Bakken ?
Bakken production is trending upward and should continue for some time .
The October 2007 production of 75,000 BOPD equates to 27 million barrels per year , a substantial amount by most measures for the US onshore sector .
This only amounts to about 0.4 % of US consumption ( using a base of 20,700 BOBP , based on EIA data ) , or 0.6 % of US imports .
Drilling activity in the Bakken continues at a frenetic pace .
It 's difficult to predict how long the upward trend in production will continue .
Over the long term , economics will play a significant role in determining how much production will be expanded .
Conclusions
1 . The Bakken shale has produced about 111 million barrels of oil during the last 50 + years in Montana and North Dakota .
2. Total Bakken production is still rising , and producing at the rate of 75,000 BOPD in October 2007 .
3 . Because of the highly variable nature of shale reservoirs , the characteristics of the historical Bakken production , and the fact that per -well rates seem to have peaked , it seems unlikely that total Bakken production will exceed 2 x to 3 x current rate of 75,000 BOPD .
4 . The latest boom in Bakken production is driven by the application of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing technology , which has added about 70 million barrels of production in 7 years .
Ultimate recovery of the already - drilled wells should be at least double this volume .
5 . The USGS estimates the mean volume of technically recoverable hydrocarbons to be 3,649 million barrels of oil .
This is roughly 7 to 12 times the size of already known resources .
6 . Based on current production and areas likely to be drilled , the USGS estimate of technically recovery resources seems optimistic .
7 . The Bakken potential resource , while large by US onshore field standards , will have only a minor effect on US production or imports .
Using 2006 US imports and consumption for comparison , the Bakken undiscovered resource of 3,649 million barrels of oil , if subsequently discovered and fully developed , would provide us with the equivalent of six months of oil consumption or 10 months of imports , spread over 20 or more years .
In reality , the reserves developed are likely to be many times smaller than this value .
8 . The October 2007 production rate of 75,000 BOPD amounts only 0.4 % of US oil consumption , or 0.6 % of imports .
9 . Per -well Bakken production peaked in August 2005 at 116 barrels a day , and was down to 79 barrels a day in October 2007 .
If the Bakken production history in the 1990s can be used as a guide , the peaking of per-well production may portend a peak in total Bakken production .

Future observations by Cassini will help test the prediction
Radar images from the Cassini - Huygens mission reinforce predictions that a reservoir of liquid water exists beneath the thick crust of ice .
If confirmed , it would mean that Titan has two of the key components for life - water and organic molecules .
Currently , three other Solar System objects are suspected of having deep oceans : Ganymede , Callisto and Europa .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( Asi ) .
We 've got to go back again with balloons and rovers and really understand this place
Prof John Zarnecki
When Cassini began to observe the largest of Saturn 's moons in 2004 , the surface was thought to be completely covered with an ocean of hydrocarbons .
But when the spacecraft turned its radar on the moon for the first time in 2004 , and the Huygens probe parachuted to the surface a year later , a different picture emerged .
Much of the surface was found to be solid , with geological features such as dunes , channels and impact craters , punctuated by vast " lakes " .
Cassini 's latest fly - by of Titan is providing a new glimpse of these features , which to researchers ' surprise , are not in the place they should be .
Scientists would like to send an instrumented balloon to Titan
Coupled with models of how the moon spins , the data suggests that the observed seasonal variation in spin rate could only exist if a liquid ocean lay beneath the solid crust .
The researchers , led by Dr Ralph Lorenz of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , US , say their predictions can be checked in the proposed extended Cassini mission or in future missions .
John Zarnecki , Professor of Space Science , at the UK's Open University , who was not part of the study , said the motivation to go back to Titan with a more sophisticated space probe was " overwhelming " .
Evidence suggests that Titan has two of the key constituents for the formation of life - water and organic molecules , and possibly a third - a source of energy , he said .
Prof Zarnecki told BBC
News : " We know there are organic molecules , the place is swarming in organics .
Titan :
The second largest moon in the Solar System
" Titan is 50 % water -ice .
If it is liquid , as this paper is implying some of it is , it looks as though we 've got at least two of the things to initiate the chemistry that leads to life .
" It would n't be too far fetched to imagine certain spots on Titan where there would be a source of energy - maybe geothermal energy , as we have on Earth at the bottom of the oceans . "
Titan is the second largest moon in the Solar System ; only Jupiter 's Ganymede satellite is bigger .
Past observations have shown that Titan in many ways resembles a very early Earth , particularly in the composition of its atmosphere .
The major difference is the frigid temperatures out near Saturn .

HDMI Cable
An HDMI cable consists primarily of a set of shielded twisted pairs which carry video data , together with embedded audio , at extremely high bitrates .
Its arrival created a few problems -- while it 's heavily preferred by content - providers due to its support for digital copy protection schemes , it is not nearly as robust over distance runs as its analog predecessors , e.g. , component video , were .
It was created to run on balanced lines , in contrast to the professional digital video standard , SDI , which runs on coax , and this early design decision has made increasing the bandwidth of HDMI cable a difficult problem .
On the plus side , in the great majority of simple installations , HDMI works trouble - free , and its " one- cable " approach to home theater interconnection has simplified the process of setting up most equipment racks .
BJC Belden Bonded - Pair HDMI Cable :
HDMI is a fragile interface , not least because of the difficulties of manufacturing twisted - pair HDMI cable to the fine tolerances required to handle the extraordinary bandwidth requirements of the HDMI signal .
To overcome those difficulties , we sought the help of Belden , the world 's technology leader in communications cable products , and we asked Belden to use its patented , exclusive Bonded - Pair technology to build us an HDMI cable with extraordinary impedance stability and low skew .
The result is a pair of products : the BJC Series - 1E 23.5 AWG HDMI Cable , and the BJC Series - FE 28 AWG HDMI Cable .
These are the only HDMI cables on the market incorporating bonded - pair technology ; they are also the only HDMI cable stocks ( with a couple of odd , and rare , exceptions ) made here in the United States -- in Richmond , Indiana .
While economic and practical constraints have required us to have connectorization and final assembly done in China , both the Series - 1E HDMI cable and the Series - FE HDMI cable are , on a cost basis , well over 50 % average U.S. - manufactured content , unlike our competitors '
HDMI cables , which ( despite , in some cases , careful attempts to avoid the point ) are manufactured entirely in China from start to finish .
Both versions of this HDMI cable are compatible with all versions of the HDMI specification , as further detailed below .
If you 're interested in the question of HDMI 2.0 compliance , see our article on this subject .

For HDMI 2.0 Compliance info , click here
Supports all HDMI protocols and standards , such as 3D , 4Kx2 K , 1080 p , etc .
For short runs , our recommended cable is the Series - FE .
If you 've read much about HDMI cable online , you know that most manufacturers use wire gage as their primary indicator of quality , because in the absence of any other measure of cable quality , people tend to assume that larger - gage cable will perform better than smaller - gage cable .
This is clearly true for power applications like speaker cable ; it 's really not as meaningful for high - speed data applications like HDMI , where signal integrity is more important than mere signal amplitude .
The Series FE brings Belden 's bonded - pair technology , with its low skew and tight impedance control , to small - gage cable and significantly outperform conventional twisted - pair designs .
These cables , though made in 28 AWG and therefore quite thin and flexible , are certified under Category 2 ( " high - speed " ) to 15 feet , considerably longer than any other 28 AWG HDMI cable , and to 25 feet in Category 1 .
All of the lengths up to 15 feet also carry " Premium HDMI Cable " certification from actual testing at the full HDMI 2.0 bandwidth of 6.0 Gbps / pair , 18.0 Gbps total .
While a larger HDMI cable of the same design ( our Series - 1 , below ) will outperform it in distance runs , when extreme distance is not required the Series - FE will provide identical performance to the much heavier , stiffer , larger - gage HDMI cable , without the difficulty of bending and fitting that the larger HDMI cable can present .
The Series FE is rated CM for in - wall installation ( higher than the typical CL2 or CL3 ) .

BJC Belden Series - 1 Bonded - Pair HDMI Cable :
Our classic solution for performance over distance is our original Belden Series - 1 , a 23.5 AWG HDMI cable .
For ordinary resolutions -- say , anything up to 1080p / 60 -- this is our best cable performance - wise , and will typically handle those resolutions to fifty feet and beyond .
For newer , higher resolution signals -- the sorts of 4 K signals first supported by HDMI 2.0 , running 18 Gbps , for example -- this cable will top out at somewhere around 20 to 25 feet , and we 'd recommend going to the Series - 3A instead .
The Series - 1 is quite thick and stiff , which is a drawback in terms of installation convenience , but is certified , at standard and high speed , to the longest distances of any conventional passive HDMI cable we know of - - 45 feet for Category 1 ( " Standard " speed ) , 25 feet for Category 2 ( " High speed " .
In actual usage , it ordinarily will work at distances far exceeding these -- we have run 1080 p video through a 125 foot Series - 1 HDMI cable without any information loss , but results will vary depending on the capabilities of the sending and receiving circuits of the devices in use .
Like the Series - FE , this HDMI cable uses Belden 's patented bonded - pair technology and the cable stock is manufactured at Belden facilities in Kentucky and Indiana ; foot for foot , it is the costliest HDMI cable stock in the world to manufacture , but we sell it at a price lower than many " premium " brands that lack the specs and the certifications that this HDMI cable holds .

BJC Series - 3A Active HDMI Cables :
For applications where the full 18.0 Gbps bandwidth is needed to run for 20 feet or more , we offer the BJC Series - 3A Active HDMI Cable .
These cables , made for us by Elka International in China , use a boost / EQ chip specifically designed for the maximum 18 Gig bandwidth permitted under HDMI 2.0 , and are powered from the HDMI socket ( so no need for an external adapter ) .
The Series - 3A cable is " directional " in that it is designed to take the signal from one end and amplify and EQ that signal at the other , so it 's important to be sure to hook it up in the correct direction !
These cables are CL2 rated for in - wall installation , and are certified " High Speed With Ethernet . "

WASHINGTON
At the White House news conference yesterday , The Chicago Tribune ’s Mark Silva gingerly snuck up on a state - of - mind question .
“ I ca n’t help but read your body language this morning , Mr. President , ” he said .
“ You seem somehow dispirited , somewhat dispirited . ”
W. did look like a kid who ’d just had his toys taken away .
But he acted humorously exasperated , as he always does when the talk turns introspective .
“ This is like , all of a sudden , it ’s like Psychology 101 , you know ? ” he said , as reporters laughed .
The reporters pressed on about whether the president was troubled about a possible “ credibility gap ” with the American people , given that the facts had failed him on Iraq and Iran and that Harry Reid had charged that “ the president is not leveling with the American people ” on war spending .

Advertisement " When you have radical ideas like this , people think you 're a crackpot , " says Paul Lister .
The Scottish landowner is a man on a mission .
He plans to wind back the clock at his estate in the Highlands by repopulating the land with a raft of animals that have not been seen in Britain for hundreds of years - including brown bears , lynx and wolves .
" What I 'm aiming is to create a wilderness and wildlife reserve similar to those that exist in Southern Africa ; something that is controlled , managed and fenced , " he told BBC News .
" It is nothing like Britain or Europe has ever seen before . "
I get quite angry when I think about the fact that when we want to put back just 1 % of the Highlands , we get potential resentment from some quarters
Paul Lister
The idea for the proposed project came to Mr Lister years ago .
He explained : " The main problem we have in Scotland is a complete overpopulation of red deer .
We probably have triple or quadruple the number of red deer than we can sustain .
" When I was 20 , I was out shooting deer and I started thinking about why we were having to cull so many of them .
And the reason was that we got rid of all the predators years ago .
" By bringing large predators back - wolves , lynxes and bears - then we would end up with a more healthy and balanced population of ungulates . "
He is keen to point out that he is not trying to reintroduce animals back into the wild , rather he is aiming for a " controlled release " into a 50,000 acre ( 20,000 hectare ) fenced enclosure .
Bringing back moose A BBC Natural World team has been following Mr Lister set up his multi-million pound scheme .
And it has all started with animals that have not been seen in the wild in Britain for many centuries - a pair of moose ( Alces alces , also referred to as elk in Europe ) .
They have recently arrived from Sweden and have been settling into a 450 acre ( 180 hectare ) enclosure within Mr Lister 's Alladale Estate .
They join some newly introduced wild boar and also 80,000 Caledonian pine , juniper , hazel and birch trees , which have recently been planted to bring back the land that he bought four years ago from its " desert state " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But while a couple of moose and some new flora are unlikely to attract too much debate , the proposed plan to introduce larger predators to his fenced reserve has provoked more controversy .
Local farmers are worried about the impact on local livestock should any large predators escape from the Alladale Estate .
On the other hand , the proposed fence to keep animals in is worrying local ramblers who want to safeguard their right to roam .
And while some ecologists are onboard with Mr Lister 's idea , others have concerns .
Timothy Coulson , professor of population biology at Imperial College London , says : " In many ways , I think this is a nice idea and I applaud him for investing the time and money to see if this will work .
" However , the proposed area for the reserve is too small to viably support , in the long run , an ecosystem containing large predators .
" A single pack of wolves will cover a huge territory , so in 50,000 acres you could probably just have one pack , and for long term survival , the animal population would have to be actively managed . "
Wolves were hunted to extinction in the UK about 200 years ago Mr Lister points out that there is still much to do before larger predators can be brought in .
For a start , he says , he needs to increase the size of his estate from 23,000 acres to 50,000 acres and there is also the need to bring his neighbours on board , as well as to navigate through the reams of red tape the project would involve .
However , he is optimistic , and believes the reserve could be up and running in two to five years .
He told the BBC : " We have covered our countryside with motorways , highways , buildings , golf courses and so on to our own benefit and satisfaction to the detriment of every animal that has ever lived there .
" I get quite angry when I think about the fact that when we want to put back just 1 % of the Highlands , we get potential resentment from some quarters .
" When someone wants to come along and do something good for the native flora and fauna , we ought to put our hands up and get on with it . "
The BBC Natural World programme Moose in the Glen will be shown on BBC Two on Wednesday 16 April at 2000 BST

Suffice it to say that I have big boobs .
Real boobs , too .
No baggies filled with gelatinous substances inserted here !
But now my size D boobs are only size C boobs , which although smaller , are still plenty big .
I am not fat .
My boobs are not billowing rolls of lard .
They 're just plain ol ' big .
I should also point out that I am fairly tall , 5 ’ 9 ” to be exact .
Evidently , these physical features seem to render fitted lingerie a near impossibility .
Unfortunately , women with big hooters do n’t have the luxury of walking around braless .
If we did , our tits would eventually hang down to our navels , much like those tribal women in the National Geographic magazines .
No thanks .
Bras are a must .
So , after rifling through rack after rack of bras of every shape , size and color imaginable hanging on those stupid little hangers that get caught on each other , other bras , your sleeve , your purse , or whatever else comes in close contact with them , I came to believe that men and men alone design bras .
Therefore , this rant goes out to those dipshit male bra designers .
If you men had boobs , you ’d understand how frustrating it is to buy a decent fitting bra , but since men only have balls , allow me to enlighten you .
First of all , whatever inspired you to believe that a woman wants a piece of inflexible wire shoved under her boobs for ‘ support ’ ?
Is it some kind of latent , sadistic desire to torture women ?
Let ’s put that same wire in your whitey tighteys and see how much you like having a piece of wire grinding on your balls every time you move .
How you ’ve managed to flood the market with these instruments of torture is beyond my understanding .
Excuse me , but my boobs , nor any other woman ’s boobs , needs to be supported by a piece of fencing .
Although in your primordial brain you may think of boobs as udders , we are not cattle and our boobs do not need to be corralled .
Thank you very much , asswipe .
I realized today that male bra designers prefer small boobs .
I can prove that because it is nearly impossible for anyone with big boobs to find a bra that is even remotely attractive .
For those of us who are well endowed , it seems that bras are for utilitarian purposes only , that is , to hold those boulders up where they belong .
No , instead of those cute , colorful bras for the tiny - titty - B - cup - and - under set , we get white , black or tan ( and sometimes pink ! ! ) industrial strength bras whose only embellishment might be some itchy lace .
Let ’s put some of that lace on your y - fronts , shall we , boys ?
And let ’s not forget to mention that these same behemoths have shoulder straps that could double as seatbelts .
Jesus fucking Christ .
Have some imagination , will you ?
It has taken decades for women ’s clothing to come in tall sizes , but finally it is possible for those of us in the high altitude zone to wear jeans that do n’t stop at the ankle and shirts whose sleeves are n’t all ‘ three - quarter ’ length .
Halle - fucking - luiah !
So , now that we ’ve come this far , why the hell have n’t any of you moron male bra designers figured out that tall women have long bodies , therefore , it might be a good idea to extend the length of the shoulder straps ?
Imagine yourself walking around with your whites pulled up your ass all day .
That ’s what it ’s like .
Is it your cheapass frugality ?
I mean , really , how much can a couple extra inches of seatbelt strapping cost ?
Dickweeds .
I believe that you shit - for - brains male bra designers imagine that every woman has boobs like Barbie’s .
It probably relates back to your childhood when you hid in the closet with your sister ’s Barbies , perversely stroking those enormous plastic tits .
Let ’s face it , Barbie has some pretty perky knockers , but it begs the question :
Have any of you imbeciles ever seen any real tits ?
THEY ARE NOT POINTED !!!!!
And furthermore , real boobs ca n’t be squeezed into points !
So why do you design bras that could pop balloons , fucktards ?
Does anyone have deformed enough boobs to wear one of those monstrosities ?
Oh that ’s right !
Barbie does !
Jesus Christ .
Okay , I ’m done ranting .
I feel better now .
Thanks for listening , Craigslisters !
By the way , for the record , after an hour of trying on a multitude of brassieres , I managed to find ONE that fit , although it looks like a seat cover for an F - 150 with obligatory seatbelt straps – white , of course .
Swell .
Just swell .
Technology in all sectors is ever - evolving .
It ’s also something that is n’t going anywhere anytime soon .
It does n’t matter if you have climbed aboard the “ tech train ” or not , you ca n’t deny the impact technology has had on the hunting world , along with the modern world in general .
While you may not automatically think about technology when you are out scoping a deer or searching for your next wild turkey , there is no question that it is all around .
If you are interested in learning more about hunting technology and what it has to offer today , keep reading .
Here you can learn about some of the most interesting innovations available today .
Technology ’s Impact on Precision in Hunting
One way that hunting technology has impacted the sport is by providing hunters with tools to increase precision .
Some examples of this include :
Shooting Accuracy
One of the first things that come to mind when it comes to the hunting industry and technology is shooting .
With the right accessories and features , you can significantly improve your shooting accuracy .
Bows and rifles are more efficient and comfortable than before , and what was considered far - fetched in the past is regarded as standard practice .
For example , smoother draw cycles on bows allow you to practice longer than before without experiencing fatigue .
These bows are also more forgiving than past models , helping improve accuracy further .
The Use of Optics
Optics are essential for finding game .
Today , the available optics have improved significantly from what was available in the past .
Rather than having to use separate binoculars to find game , it is possible to mount and use optics on your gun or bow .
The right optics can help you avoid miles of hiking because it is essentially doing the walking for you .
The longer you look through the optics , the more animals you can eventually find .
Also , with spotting scopes , you can look at animals several miles away and see them clearly , as if you were standing right there .
Some options let you digiscope and attach your cell phone to the device , which provides you with an awe - inspiring tool .
Technology ’s Impact on Efficiency in Hunting
Along with precision , technology has also improved efficiency for hunters .
Some of the ways this is possible include :
The Weight
From ultralight backpacks , carbon rifles and bows , and quality backpacking equipment , hunting gear is only getting more lightweight than ever before .
The less weight you carry into the field , the fresher , and more energy you have for the task at hand .
This is especially important for backpack hunters .
If you are an avid hunter , you understand how beneficial it is to reduce your load when possible .
Your Clothing
In the past , going hunting in the winter meant wearing several layers of clothing .
Thermals , jackets , and flannels were just a few of the items you had to put on .
Even though you were likely warm , you probably were not too comfortable .
Today , this is n’t the case .
Technology has also impacted the clothing used for hunting .
Now , you can wear two base layers and a jacket , thanks to the ultralight rain gear that is available .
This makes the clothing lighter and warmer , which also means they are more functional .
Technology ’s Impact on Safety in Hunting
Safety is a top concern when heading into the field , regardless of if you are hunting alone or not .
You are dealing with knives , firearms , sharp broadheads and more , and often trekking in a dangerous environment .
Today , gadgets are invaluable when hunting , including smart devices and internet connectivity .
For example , there are GPS trackers that help with directions and communication .
You can even create a route before departing online and access it in the field .
You can also learn how to search in a pdf while in the field , if needed , which can help you with finding specific locations , recognizing animals , and plant identification .
Remember , though , safety is n’t just about gadgets .
It is more about your brain .
You must use caution and take along a first - aid kit just in case something goes wrong .
The Impact of the Internet on Hunting
Today , everyone uses the internet .
This is how you keep in touch with loved ones , consume entertainment and media , and even run your business through it .
When the internet first emerged , many people believed this was just something for the rich and famous , but this simply is n’t the case .
Everyone in all locations now uses it , and it has become a vital part of day - to - day life for many .
With so much information online , your learning opportunities are endless .
It does n’t matter the topic , either .
You can find info on animals , where to hunt certain animals , and more .
Hunting Technology : Has it Impacted You ?
As you can see , hunting technology has significantly changed and evolved over the years .
If you hunt , you have likely been impacted by these changes and the new technology that is available .
While it is n’t necessary to take advantage of every new type of technology and innovation produced , there is no question that it can significantly impact and improve every aspect of hunting in positive ways .
If you are interested in learning more about how technology is impacting and changing every aspect of people ’s lives , be sure to check out some of our other blogs .
You will find that our information is accurate , up to date , and will help you gain insight into an array of topics .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Teenagers with a bedroom television tend to have poorer diet and exercise habits and lower grades in school than those without one , U.S. researchers said on Monday .

Teenagers with a bedroom television tend to have poorer diet and exercise habits and lower grades in school than those without one , U.S. researchers said on Monday .

While many studies have examined TV viewing habits of young people , researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health said little had been known about the consequences in particular for older adolescents of having a bedroom TV .
They questioned 781 adolescents , ages 15 to 18 , in the Minneapolis area in 2003 and 2004 .
Of them , 62 percent reported having a television in their bedroom .
Not surprisingly , those with a bedroom TV were more apt to watch it a lot , clocking four to five more hours in front of a television per week , the researchers said .
Twice as many of the teens with a bedroom TV were classified as heavy TV watchers -- at least five hours a day -- compared to those without one .
Girls with a bedroom television reported getting less vigorous exercise -- 1.8 hours per week compared to 2.5 hours for girls without a TV .
They also ate fewer vegetables , drank more sweetened beverages and ate meals with their family less often , the researchers said .
Boys with a bedroom TV reported having a lower grade point average than boys without one , as well as eating less fruit and having fewer family meals , the researchers said .
“ It really clearly points out that there ’s some merit to not allowing your child to have a TV in the bedroom , ” said Daheia Barr - Anderson , one of the researchers .
“ When you upgrade your TV in the living room and you have this smaller TV that ’s out of date but still usable , parents should really resist putting it in one of your children ’s bedrooms -- and resist the pressure from the child to have a TV in their bedroom , ” she said in a telephone interview .
SURPRISE ON OBESITY
The American Academy of Pediatrics urges parents to remove TV sets from children ’s bedrooms , the researchers noted .
The findings were published in the academy ’s journal Pediatrics .
Boys were more likely to have a television in their bedroom than girls -- 68 percent versus 58 percent .
Teens from the highest income families were far less likely than those from all other income levels to have a bedroom TV , the survey found .
Among black teens , 82 percent reported having a bedroom TV , compared to 66 percent of Hispanics , 60 percent of whites and 39 percent of Asian Americans .
The researchers tracked body mass index -- a measure based on height and weight -- and found that having a bedroom TV had no influence on whether teens were obese .
Barr - Anderson said that finding was a surprise , considering that previous studies looking at younger children -- one on elementary school kids and one on low - income preschoolers -- found that having a bedroom TV was an even stronger predictor of obesity than the time spent watching TV .
Both boys and girls with a bedroom TV reported spending less time reading and doing homework , although the researchers said the differences were not statistically significant .
But Clinton advisers have recently pointed to Mr. Obama ’s financial advantage , in what appears to be an attempt to lay the groundwork to stay in the race should she lose by a small margin or squeak to victory in either or both states .
“ They are dumping a lot of money there , ” said Mrs. Clinton ’s chief strategist , Mark Penn , referring to the Obama campaign .
That said , Mrs. Clinton once enjoyed double - digit leads in both states , and her campaign had told supporters concerned about her string of losses that her effort to win the Democratic nomination would get back on track after solid wins in Ohio and Texas .
Democrats said narrow victories there might not be enough to stanch a flow of uncommitted superdelegates  elected officials and party leaders  to Mr. Obama , who have until now deferred to the request by Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers to wait for the vote in the two states .
Mr. Obama , campaign officials said , has spent about $ 10 million on television advertising in Texas since early February ; Mrs. Clinton has spent just less than $ 5 million .
Mr. Obama has spent about $ 5.3 million for television advertising in Ohio , compared with just under $ 3 million for Mrs. Clinton , the officials said .
Those figures do not take into account substantial advertising being presented for Mr. Obama by the Service Employees International Union .
It also does not include money that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton spent in Texas on Spanish - language television and radio stations in a competition for Latino voters , whom Mrs. Clinton had once considered an unassailable part of her base .
“ I have many friends in Texas ; I know your tradition and culture , ” Mrs. Clinton said in one commercial broadcasting in Houston this weekend , speaking into the camera as subtitles translate her remarks into Spanish .
Mr. Obama ’s financial advantage is helping him beyond the airwaves .
His campaign flew 200 paid organizers from across the country to 10 campaign offices in Texas right after the Feb.
5 primaries , aides said , when some of Mrs. Clinton ’s staff members were volunteering to work without pay .
Another 150 were sent to build get - out - the - vote networks in Ohio , working for Paul Tewes , who was the Obama campaign ’s director in Iowa .
Mr. Obama ’s eight - point victory in that state ’s caucuses gave his campaign a huge boost .
Mrs. Clinton ’s on - the - ground effort is no less aggressive and extensive ; in particular , she has tapped into the network of support provided to her by Mr. Strickland .

Lately I ’ve been reading some rather unclean Python code .
Maybe this is mainly because the author(s ) of the code had no in - depth knowledge of the Python language itself , the ‘ platform ’ delivered with cPython , … Here ’s a list of some of the mistakes you should really try to avoid when writing Python code :
Remember Python comes batteries included
Python is shipped with a whole bunch of standard modules implementing a broad range of functionality , including text handling , various data types , networking stuff ( both low - and high - level ) , document processing , file archive handling , logging , etc .
All these are documented in the Python Library Documentation , so it is a must to browse at least through the list of available modules , so you get some notions of what you can use by default .
An example : do n’t introduce a dependency on Twisted to implement a very basic and simple custom HTTP server if you do n’t have any performance needs , use BaseHTTPServer and derivates .

Python is Python , do n’t try to emulate bad coding patterns from other languages
Python is a mature programming language which provides great flexibility , but also has some pretty specific patterns which you might not know in other languages you used before .
As an example , do n’t try to emulate PHP ’s ‘ include ’ or ‘ require ’ function , at all .
This could be done , somewhat , by writing the code to be included ( and executed on inclusion ) in a module on the top level ( ie. not in functions / classes / … ) , and using something like ‘ from foo import *’ where you want this code to be executed .
This will work , but it can become hard to maintain this .
Modules are not meant to be used like this , so do n’t .
If you need to execute some code at some point , put it in a module as a function , import the function and call it wherever you want .

Do n’t pollute the global namespace
Do not use ‘ from foo import *’ , as this will pull in everything defined in foo , but also all modules imported in foo , and maybe even their imports , etc .
Try to ‘ import foo ’ and use foo .
whatever , or use ‘ from foo import whatever , somethingelse ’ .
Explicit imports make code much more readable , and make it much easier to figure out in which module something you ’re using in the current module is defined , if it ’d be imported by one of your many global imports otherwise .

Use Pythonesque coding pattern
This is very related to the previous item , obviously .
Python has some well - known constructs to handle some situations .
Get to know and understand them .
An example : as you might know , Python has no switch / case construct .
There ’s a very neat way to implement this though by simply using a dict and function objects ( or lambda functions ) .
An example : def handle_one ( ) : return ' one ' def handle_two ( ) : return ' two ' def handle_default ( ) : return ' unknown ' cases = { ' one ' : handle_one , ' two ' : handle_two , ' three ' : lambda : ' three ' , } for i in ( ' one ' , ' two ' , ' three ' , ' four ' , ) : handler = cases.get ( i , handle_default ) print handler ( )
We ’re using the dict .
get method here , which can take an optional ‘ default ’ argument .
Pretty neat , huh ?

Document your code
Python has this great language feature called docstrings .
Sprinkle them throughout your code rigorously .
Do this while writing your functions / classes , not afterwards .
Everyone knows that ’s extremely boring and depressing .

Write tests
Write testing code .
Python includes at least 2 ways to write tests : using standard unit tests , or using doctests , test code snippets included in your docstrings , both useful and illustrative .
There ’s no way to know some code refactoring went well if you ca n’t test the result .

Use error reporting wisely
Python includes exception handling .
Use this wisely : when something goes wrong in some function which should return a string normally to be displayed to the user , do n’t just return a normal string with some error message inside , as if everything went well , but return the message packed in an exception object , so the calling code will know something went wrong ( and maybe handle according to this information ) , whilst still being able to display the error message to the user .
Next to this , subclass Exception ( or a more specific Exception child class ) , do n’t just return base Exceptions , unless in some basic circumstances .
An exception class should n’t be huge : ‘ class FooException ( Exception ) : pass ’ cuts the job .

Do n’t turn off error reporting during development
In some cases it ’s useful to make sure your application keeps on running , no matter what happens ( this is eg how Twisted handles server handler exceptions ) .
Python provides some ways to achieve this , so in case you need it you can use it , but make sure you provide a way to disable this , so you can tell your application to crash hard on exceptions during development .
This way you ’ll certainly notice the issue and you ’ll be able to fix it early .

Use Python basic built - in functions
A basic example : to check whether a function parameter is of a certain type , do n’t use something like ‘ arg.__class__ == MyClass ’ , use ‘ isinstance ( arg , MyClass ) ’.
Did you know isinstance ’s second argument can be a tuple / list ?
If it is , arg ’s type will be checked against all types in this list , so there ’s no need to do several ‘ isinstance ’ calls .
Other useful built-ins are getattr / setattr / hasattr ( obviously ) , issubclass , …

Just like many other programming languages , Python allows you to add static methods to a class .
Just decorate your method using the ‘ staticmethod ’ decorator !
Next to static methods , Python knows the concept of class methods , which get the class as argument .
You most likely wo n’t need these often .

Use a code metrics tool
I personally use PyLint ( with some rules disabled ) .
This tool will check your code for various things : missing imports , typos , wrong variable / function / class / module naming , syntax errors , … which could be in your code even if your test suite runs fine .
Maybe you can even add a hook to the VCS you ’re using , which does n’t allow you to check in code unless it got a PyLint score of eg .

If you have some other hints , comments !
The sustained vituperative attack and the feeble apologetic defense of Reverend Wright ’s brilliant , eloquent and substantive sermon in defense of human dignity speaks to the basic ethical , political and strategic issues of our epoch .
For Reverend Wright was not merely ‘ commenting ’ on an ethical omission of our day but raising fundamental principles about the behavior of states , the role of individual conscience in the face of crimes against humanity and the need to give name and take action in the face of evil .
The entire spectrum of politicians , the mass media and , in particular , the political parties and two ( and a half ) of the presidential candidates raise , by their hostile reaction and the substance of their criticism , vital issues of the relation between the State and Religion .
“ They know what they say ” , ( to paraphrase and re-state Jesus Christ ’s comments on his persecutors ) applies with a vengeance to the barrage of mindless screeds which were intentionally launched against the Reverend ’s brilliant analysis and dissection of the immoral means in pursuit of the great crimes of our epoch .
Of course , the verbal assault of Reverend Wright was directed explicitly to discredit and disqualify Democratic Presidential candidate , Senator Barak Obama , a long time member of Wright ’s United Church of Christ Chicago parish .
Many were , and continue to be , vile accusations charging that his sermon was ‘ incendiary ’ , ‘ anti- American ’ , ‘ racist ’ and ‘ politically extremist ’ .
Phrases critical of US empire - building were dubbed the ‘ God Damn America ’ sermon .
Moral condemnations of ‘ war and money ’ were decontextualized to accuse Reverend Wright of being ‘ a man of hate ’ , ‘ a hate monger ’ and a ‘ racist extremist ’ .
The insults and verbal assassins came from both liberal and conservative politicians , writers , mass media pundits and commentators .
Barak Obama ’s ‘ defense ’ of Wright was based on separating the benign and respected avuncular ‘ person ’ ( or personality ) of the Reverend from his brilliant , substantive , historical analysis , political diagnosis and profoundly ethical moral judgment .
By defending the messenger but condemning the profound message , Obama ultimately sided with the political defenders and apologists of a brutal , militaristic , imperial order , thus enabling him to continue his electoral campaign .
Key Theoretical and Analytical Insights
Wright ’s speech is informed by four profound theoretical and conceptual insights :
First ,
Wright ’s central idea is that repeated large - scale , long - term offensive imperial wars and military actions lead to military reactions or counter - attacks on US property and lives , military and civilian , outside and inside the United States .
Given the authoritarian political environment and the hostile mass media , Wright cites the utterances of a former US Ambassador and long - time member of the State Department Establishment , Edward Peck to corroborate his observation .
Contrary to the pro-empire political scientists who predominate in the prestigious Ivy League universities , and ignore the historical framework of critical readings of empire building , Wright ’s theoretical argument is grounded in a wealth of historical experiences , which he enumerates to reinforce his central point .
His theoretical argument is woven around the 9/11 Muslim - Arab attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
He cites the colonial and post - colonial savaging of the Middle East , including the military attacks and economic boycott of Iraq , the bombing of Sudan , the US support of state terrorist regimes and the Israeli destruction of Palestinian and Lebanese lives .
Imperial action and anti-imperial re-action —
Wright ’s algebraic formulation refutes the Ivy League professors ’ propagandistic arguments , which extrapolate the violence of the anti-imperial reaction from its preceding bloody imperial historical framework in order to present the subsequent imperialist action as a defensive response .
Wright ’s theoretical - historical correction of the false premises of orthodox academics and mainstream politicians regarding the source of violence in the international system lays the groundwork for a detailed commentary and moral judgment of the principal conflicts of our time .
By bringing to the fore a succinct enumeration of the sequence of US violent military actions from the violent seizure of Indian lands to the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima , to the colonial wars in Africa to the invasion of Panama and the bombing of Grenada , Wright establishes the historical basis for his judgment that the driving force of US foreign policy is ‘ militarism and money ’ .
His critics , unable or unwilling to challenge his historical narrative , resort to ad hominem attacks , relying on labeling techniques , attributing to him a ‘ strident ’ style or ‘ incendiary language ’ .
Second , Wright provides a socio- psychological framework for understanding contemporary elite - manipulated and motivated mass violent sentiment in the aftermath of 9/11 and the initial general embrace of a military response .
Wright sets out a three - stage sequence of socio- psychological ‘ feelings ’ : ( 1 ) reverence for the sites attacked and sorrow for the victims , ( 2 ) revenge against a general ‘ other ’ ( to be designated by the imperial rulers ) , ( 3 ) hatred and war against enemies and unarmed innocents alike .
Drawing on historical analogies with the biblical account ( Psalm 137 , all nine verses ) of the Israelite reverence of the Temple ( of Jerusalem ) , its destruction ( by Chaldeans ) and their subsequent return and revenge ( slaughter and eviction of all non-Israelite inhabitants ) ,
Wright draws a parallel with the US reverence for ‘ money ’ , symbolized by the World Trade Center , and ‘ military ’ ( the Pentagon ) ; their thirst for ‘ revenge ’ rooted in the ‘ feelings ’ of pain , sorrow , anger , outrage , destruction and senseless carnage ’ this leads , he reasons , to hatred and demands to attack and punish ‘ someone ’ ( ‘ pay back ’ ) .
In our time this means killing armed adversaries and unarmed civilians — Afghanistan and Iraq , soldiers and civilians .
Wright brilliantly elucidates the emotional and political link between ‘ worship ’ ( over losses ) and ‘ war ’ , presumably to restore the ‘ revered sites ’ of money ( financial credibility ) and military power ( imperial credibility ) .
Wright ’s socio- psychological framework allows us to understand the way in which the Bush Administration blended mass objects of veneration ( loss of human lives ) with the sacred sites of the elite ( Wall Street and the Pentagon ) into a powerful engine of war .
Interestingly , Wright ’s citation of the biblical account of Israeli indiscriminate revenge ( ‘ happy is he who dashes their infants against the rocks ’ Psalm 137 ) parallels the policies and practices pursued by the contemporary American Israelite policy makers in the Pentagon who pursued policies of total destruction and dismemberment of Iraq .
Though Wright does not specifically refer to this parallelism , it springs to mind when he refers to the current injustices , and his specific mention of Israeli oppression of the Palestinians as part of the global injustices .
Third , Reverend Wright links his ‘ practical ’ historical and theoretical analysis to a set of moral judgments and policy prescriptions .
The wars of the last 500 years have economic and racial dimensions ( ‘ riches and color ’ ) pitting rich white elites against poor people of color .
Imperial violence begets oppressed violence ; state terror based on superior arms begets individuals willing to sacrifice their lives in terrorist responses .
Confronted with these historical and social conditions , he counsels the American people ( not just his black parishioners ) to engage in ‘ self - reflection ’ .
By emphasizing and giving priority to ‘ self ’ reflection he wants to undermine the effort of the political elites to focus mass attention on the asserted faults of ‘ other people ’ , the target of military assaults .
Wright emphasizes the need to create primary ( family ) and secondary ( community ) solidarity and affection ( love ) as opposed to bonding with the war - making elite .
By emphasizing reflection , Wright is openly rejecting blind adhesion to the elite and belief in their lies for war .
From the Socratic logic of critical self - reflection ( ‘ know yourself ’ ) and solidarity , Wright envisions a time for ‘ social transformation ’ .
Armed with a social awareness of the historical and present record of elite - driven imperial wars , Wright postulates the need for fundamental structural changes , “ … in the way we have been doing things as a society , a country , as an arrogant superpower .
We cannot keep messing other countries ” .
In other words Wright links changes in inner individual spiritual and social consciousness with collective social and political action directed at a fundamental transformation of the social structure and economic and political system , which make us an ‘ arrogant superpower ’ .
In his own words , Wright wants to convince the American people to transform imperial military wars into internal political wars against racist and class injustices .
He proposes a fundamental redistribution of wealth through reallocation of the public budget .
Citing the “ $ 1.3 trillion dollar tax gift to the rich ” , he counters with a policy proposal to fund universal health care and the reconstruction of the educational system to serve the poor .
Reverend Wright , in speaking to the American people , not only condemns human catastrophes inflicted on working people at home and abroad by the ‘ arrogant superpower ’ empire - builders , but points to the great historical opportunities for changes .
His is not a message of other worldly spiritual salvation ; it is a call to action here and now .
His is not a superficial critique of individual misbehavior or ‘ failed policies ’ ( as his former parishioner , Obama would have it ) but a deep structural analysis of systemic failure which demands a ‘ social transformation , which goes to the root of the present day policies of imperial wars and state and individual terrorism .
Conclusion
The reason for the repeated vicious personal attacks on Reverend Wright by the mass media and the political leaders and academic apologists for empire building is abundantly clear — to prevent a powerful , reasonable , logical and relevant analysis from influencing the American public or even exercising any influence on the Presidential campaign .
Equally important the political and media attacks on Reverend Wright are meant to destroy freedom of conscience , the separation of Church and State .
What the critics want , is a religion and religious figures at the service of the state , which blesses war planners , honors war criminals , arouses mass hatred of state - designated target peoples .
The ‘ arrogant superpower ’ honors the ministers , priests and rabbis who follow state policy spewing hatred against Arabs and Muslims .
Nothing more and nothing less , Reverend Wright is standing in word and deed for the freedom and autonomy of individuals and institutions against the voracious spread of totalitarian state power .
Clearly the irrational vituperative , sustained attack on Reverend Wright is more than a reactionary political electoral ploy in a racist electoral campaign ; it is a fundamental attack on our democratic freedoms and the autonomy of our religious institutions .
He had a double - barreled approach .
He was a respected scholar who ingeniously sought to prove his views with empirical and statistical research .
These views were largely anti-Keynesian .
John Maynard Keynes preached that government spending could ward off recession or at least ameliorate their impact .
Friedman argued there was little to do but maintain a regularly growing money supply .
There is a direct line from Milton Friedman 's ascendancy in the 1970s to the debacle on Wall Street today .
Friedman had been working his brand of economic ideology roughly since the late 1940s and early 1950s , but he did not strike gold with mainstream economists and the public until the hyper-inflation of the 1970s .
This marks , at last , the end of the Age of Friedman .
And not too soon .
The End of the Age of Milton Friedman , by Jeff Madrick :
The Bush administration has thrown in the towel on the long battle begun in the 1970s to minimize government oversight of the economy .
In light of the credit crisis , it now wants to regulate Wall Street .
Treasury Secretary Paulson has put to together broad set of reforms , not truly effectual , but a serious start .
But Friedman 's monetarism was discarded long ago -- officially by the Federal Reserve in 1984 .
They worry about interest rates now ...
And , in fact , traditional Keynesian stimulus has made a big comeback .
The conservative Bush clambered to get aboard a Keynesian fiscal stimulus package initiated by the House Democrats in December .
The second barrel was Friedman 's articulate popular policy writings .
What did remain of Friedman 's philosophy ... was his deeply held , well - articulated and simplistic view that government regulation was almost always bad for us .
Competition was the great disciplinarian of market excess , wrote Friedman , obeying such predecessors as Friedrich van Hayek ...
By 1999 , even Bill Clinton and many a Congressional Democrat fully supported the elimination of key financial regulations established in the New Deal .
As night follows day , what happened was a return of the excesses of the 1920s .
Competition is not enough to ward off excesses .
Free floating prices do not automatically stabilize economies .
Financial markets in particular encourage excess naturally , a point made by the more profound economist , Hyman Minsky .
Friedman 's followers will seldom admit that much of his public policy was not supported by genuine empirical research , unlike his monetarism .
...
In my view , the empirics never supported the stronger propositions he made .
But in the area of public policy , it was largely ideology .
It was mostly an exaggerated application of Adam Smith 's invisible hand : we would all be better off if we just maximize our profits .
Why did Friedman 's views become popular ?
As he himself conceded , crisis in the 1970s demanded a new set of ideas .
Crisis in the 2000s is now demanding a return to greater realism .
Will the nation overshoot , as it did with Friedman 's ideological deregulation ?
Not likely .
The powerful vested interests are around to keep government regulators in check .
The Bush administration proposals reflect that ; they are weak .
And though the Democrats are on the case , it is most likely the nation will not do enough .
But if the demise of simplistic Friedmanite ideology is now upon us , at least this crisis has had one silver lining .
...
A couple of comments .
As I noted in this post , over the last several decades there was a general feeling among economists that , whenever possible , we should loosen regulations on markets .
Friedman had something to do with that , but the idea predates him .
However , contrary to claims above and elsewhere , I do n't think the changes to the Glass - Steagall act under Clinton can be cited as a cause of the subprime crisis .
The breakdown of the barrier between commercial and investment banking is not what led to the problems we are seeing now .
The changes that were enacted reflected the general attitude toward regulation of the financial industry and regulation more generally -- there was a belief that it was time to loosen the strings and let competition work its wonders in terms of lower prices , increased quantities , and more robust innovation .
Many pointed to all of the new financial products as evidence of how well deregulation of the financial sector was working ( and while not all of the innovation was beneficial , the current crisis shows that , there were a lot of changes that came about as a result of deregulation that helped the typical household ) .
I also disagree that there is no empirical evidence to support Friedman 's position .
The article talks about Friedman 's opposition to regulation , but he was opposed to government intervention generally , both through regulation and through monetary and fiscal policy intended to stabilize the economy .
With respect to regulation , there are who knows how many papers discussing the welfare costs of regulation of financial markets , and if you broaden the discussion to all markets , there has been a substantial amount of work on this topic ( e.g. think of Glaeser 's work on regulation as one tiny slice of the entire body of work ) .
Within that body of work , it is certainly possible to find support for Friedman 's idea that regulation can inhibit market performance .
As to government intervention to stabilize the macroeconomy , the Barro papers in the 1970s showing that only unanticipated money can affect GDP , and the large body of associated work , certainly supported Friedman .
This work was very influential , and there were similar papers on Ricardian equivalence and the like showing that fiscal policy did not have much power to affect the macroeconomy ( there are also papers on the other side of each debate and the idea that policy does affect the macroeconomy is now widely held ) .
As for whether markets stabilize themselves , it depends upon what you mean by stabilize .
If we do nothing and markets crash leading to a big recession , the economy will eventually recover on its own .
It might be in the long - run when " we are all dead , " but I do n't think many people believe we would be permanently crippled if we failed to intervene ( beyond the legal and institutional structure required to support a market economy ) .
The question is not if markets stabilize themselves - given enough time they do - the question is whether government intervention can make the adjustment less painful .
Stabilizing markets does not always mean shortening cycles .
If the economy is about to crash and displace workers faster than they can be reabsorbed in other sectors - a worry in the present situation - that is less preferred to a somewhat slower adjustment where displaced resources can be quickly reabsorbed elsewhere .
The sponge ( moving resources elsewhere ) can only sop up so much excess at a time , and sometimes it 's necessary to smooth the adjustment over a longer time period to prevent the build up of idle resources .
You do n't want to force adjustment that is faster than the economy can handle in terms of making the appropriate transformations .
Conversely , the government should also try to shorten cycles .
Continuing with the same example , the government can try to enhance the absorption rate .
Retraining , tax breaks for moving , tax breaks that stimulate hiring in other sectors , government spending that creates employment opportunities , there are all sorts of ways the government can make the sponge absorb more excess in a given time period .
To me , stabilizing the economy means allowing the economy to make the structural changes it needs to make with the least amount of pain possible .
Sometimes that requires speeding up the process so that excesses are sopped up faster , and sometimes that means slowing down the process so that resources are n't displaced only to sit idle while waiting to move to where they are needed .
Monetary and fiscal policy are useful here , but regulation can help too by preventing conditions that lead to instabilities , and by creating conditions that facilitate smooth adjustment .
Markets will adjust on their own given enough time , they are not unstable in that sense , and there are two views out there .
There are those , like me , who believe that government can make the adjustment process less painful through regulation and active intervention , and those who believe the economy is best left to make adjustments on its own , any intervention just makes things worse .
I agree with the article that the belief in the wonders of free markets , brought about in part by Friedman 's advocacy , led to a general belief that deregulation was best , and that in following that prescription economists forgot some of the lessons of the Great Depression , the S&L crisis , and other financial meltdowns around the world .
I hope we have relearned that markets can have meltdowns when substantial market failures are present - financial markets are particularly problematic - and that cyclical fluctuations are still a worry .
Both things that Friedman opposed , regulation and government intervention to stabilize the economy , can be used to prevent market excesses that lead to costly adjustment as they are corrected , and to minimize the costs of adjustment to structural and cyclical changes in the economy .
Too much regulation stifles markets , and too little regulation can also be a problem .
The same is true about monetary and fiscal policy , both tools can be over - or under-utilized , or used inappropriately .
As I noted here , my bias is clearly toward letting markets work on their own to the extent possible .
Like Friedman and most other economists , I think markets do have desirable properties and solve allocation problems better than other systems we have tried ( which is not to say the market system is perfect at this task ) .
But markets do n't always perform optimally , and we should n't hesitate to impose regulation or use monetary and fiscal policy when they are needed .
Update : A follow - up :
A Fresh Look at the Apostle of Free Markets , by Peter S. Goodman , NY Times : Joblessness is growing .
Millions of homes are sliding into foreclosure .
The financial system continues to choke on the toxic leftovers of the mortgage crisis .
The downward spiral of the economy is challenging a notion that has underpinned American economic policy for a quarter - century — the idea that prosperity springs from markets left free of government interference .
The modern - day godfather of that credo was Milton Friedman , who attributed the worst economic unraveling in American history to regulators , declaring in a 1976 essay that “ the Great Depression was produced by government mismanagement . ”
Five years later , Ronald Reagan entered the White House , elevating Mr. Friedman ’s laissez - faire ideals into a veritable set of commandments .
Taxes were cut , regulations slashed and public industries sold into private hands , all in the name of clearing government from the path to riches .
As the economy expanded and inflation abated , Mr. Friedman played the role of chief evangelist in the mission to let loose the animal instincts of the market .
But with market forces now seemingly gone feral , disenchantment with regulation has given way to demands for fresh oversight , placing Mr. Friedman ’s intellectual legacy under fresh scrutiny .
Just as the Depression remade government ’s role in economic life , ... the current downturn has altered the balance .
As Wall Street , Main Street and Pennsylvania Avenue seethe with recriminations , a bipartisan chorus has decided that unfettered markets are in need of fettering .
Bailouts , stimulus spending and regulations dominate the conversation .
In short , the nation steeped in the thinking of a man who blamed government for the Depression now beseeches government to lift it to safety .
... “ What Milton Friedman said was that government should not interfere , ” said Allen Sinai , chief global economist for Decision Economics Inc. , a consulting group .
“ It did n’t work .
We now are looking at one of the greatest real estate busts of all time .
The free market is not geared to take care of the casualties , because there ’s no profit motive .
There ’s no market incentive to deal with the unemployed or those who have lost their homes . ” Mr. Friedman ['s ] ... intellectual bent was forged as a graduate student at the University of Chicago , a base for those who saw themselves as guardians of classical economics in a world then under the spell of woolly - headed revisionists .
The chief object of their scorn was John Maynard Keynes , and his message that government had to juice the economy with spending during times of duress .

So firm was his regard for market forces , so deep his disdain for government , that Mr. Friedman once said : “ If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert , in five years there would be a shortage of sand . ” ...
Among professional economists , Mr. Friedman ’s analytical mastery was near - universally admired .
...
But the reviews for Mr. Friedman ’s work grow mixed when the subject moves to his role as chief proselytizer in the drive to reduce the role of government in public life .
He laid out a blueprint in his 1962 book , “ Capitalism and Freedom , ” calling for the end of the military draft , the abolition of the licensing of doctors and the creation of “ education vouchers ” that parents could use to send children to private schools , injecting competition into public education .
Two years later , Mr. Friedman put those principles to work as an economic adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator Barry Goldwater , a Republican from Arizona .
The campaign called for the abolition of government oversight of the energy , telephone and airline industries and the dismantling of the Social Security system and national parks .
Mr. Goldwater took a drubbing at the hands of Lyndon Johnson .
Mr. Friedman would remain in the policy wilderness until the rise of President Reagan .
Then , his notions about rolling back government took on the force of dogma .
...
In the United States , the reconsideration of the Friedman doctrine came via the global financial crisis that has resulted from the collapse of American real estate .
Many economists blame regulators for ignoring warning signs that banks and investors were growing reckless .
One Friedman acolyte has taken the brunt of such criticisms — Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the Federal Reserve .
But as America reaches for regulation to tame the markets , the keepers of the Friedman flame remain resolute that government is no solution .
“ Friedman taught some fundamental long - run truths and he was adept and skilled and almost brilliant at getting them into the public domain , ” said Allan H. Meltzer , an economist at Carnegie Mellon .
“ Now we ’ve come into a crisis that has dampened enthusiasm for those policies , and we ’re headed back into a period of more regulations that will do the same bad things as in the past . ”
Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong discuss this article , though I cut the part Krugman discusses since I thought it was misleading ( at best ) .

Just make sure that you inspect foreclosure homes thoroughly and take into consideration the cost of repairs needed when determining if the price you will pay for a bank foreclosure home is indeed a good bargain .
Bank Foreclosed Homes
Bank foreclosed homes are also called real estate owned ( REO ) foreclosures .
When property owners are unable to make payments on their bank - held mortgage loan , the bank forecloses on the property in an attempt to repossess it .
This is how a property becomes a bank foreclosure home .
Experienced investors know that while a bank foreclosure is being processed , owners may sell their homes in order to avoid foreclosure .
This period is referred to as the pre foreclosure period .
Often times , owners are willing to negotiate a lower price for the sale of their home during this period so that they can avoid damage to their credit score .
In the end , the investor gets a great price while the seller avoids foreclosure and maintains a good credit score .
This is a win -win situation for both parties .
If the home is not sold before the foreclosure is processed , the title of the bank foreclosure home is transferred to the bank .
Banks , however , do not like to own foreclosure properties .
They are in the business of dealing with money , not real estate , and bank foreclosures are a burden on banks for several reasons :
They are expensive to maintain -
The bank must pay taxes , insurance , maintenance and security for their bank foreclosure homes .
The longer they hold on to bank foreclosure homes , the more money they lose .
The bank looks bad - Having a large inventory of bank foreclosure homes on their books highlights their bad lending decisions .
The bank needs to recover the money lost on bank foreclosures .
Due to these reasons , banks try to get rid of bank foreclosures as fast as they can .
This is how investors can capitalize on these properties .
It is often possible to negotiate deals where you can buy bank foreclosure homes or government foreclosures at a price that is anywhere up to 60 % below market value .
With the incredible opportunity these properties present , you can make a nice profit every time you invest in bank foreclosure homes !

Hillary Clinton ’s win in Pennsylvania just was not big enough to allow her to hope to win the elected delegate count .
She is increasingly using dark and exaggerated rhetoric and 2/3s of Democrats complain that she has gone too negative ( less than half say that about Obama ) .
Her exaggerations yesterday extended into the realm of international politics in a most unfortunate way .
It seems clear to me that she cannot win the nomination via elected delegates and that she is hoping to win by scaring the super delegates about Obama .
This strategy is counterproductive for the Democratic Party and for the country .
Clinton needed to win by well into the double digits in Pennsylvania ( which is how she began in the polling there months ago ) in order to remain credible .
10 points does n’t do it .
( One reader pointed out that it seems actually to be 9.2 % , not double digits at all ) .
Obama actually won Texas , which will be a headline in June when all the counting is done there ( do n’t ask ) .
It is over .
She should stop before more damage is done .
The Israeli spy ring that penetrated the US Pentagon to steal high - tech secrets including nuclear ones was bigger than just Jonathan Pollard .
It is an open secret in US security circles that no foreign country spies on the US more intensively than Israel .
And , apparently , none has been more successful in actually prying loose top secret documents .
Sy Hersh ’s sources alleged to him that secrets that went to Israel were either in turn picked up by Soviet moles in Israel or were sold on the black market and ended up with the Soviet Union .
The damage that Israeli spying has done to US security is immense , not only because of such leaks but also because of Israeli reverse engineering of US technology and the pirating of it .
Further , the nuclearization of the Middle East that the Israelis initiated has the potential to drag us all into Armageddon .
The Israeli Right is always going on about threats to Israel ’s existence , even though it is the most powerful country in the Middle East .
But no one ever brings up its strangulation of the Palestinian nation , its siege of Gaza , its dispossession of the West Bankers .
The right makes an imagined future threat the basis for actual victimization of others in the present .
America ’s security is deeply threatened by the ongoing Israeli colonization projects in the Middle East , as should have been clear for some time .
How dangerous the phantasms of the Right really are is underscored by Hillary Clinton ’s remarks yesterday :
‘ In an interview with ABC ’s Good Morning America , Clinton was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons .
She replied : “ In the next 10 years , during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel , we would be able to totally obliterate them .
That ’s a terrible thing to say but those people who run Iran need to understand that , because that perhaps will deter them from doing something that would be reckless , foolish and tragic . ” ‘
Clinton has unfortunately fallen into a typical Washington fear - mongering fantasy .
Iran does not have a nuclear weapon .
As of last fall , US intelligence determined that it was not trying to get a nuclear weapon .
There is no realistic likelihood of Iran having a bomb ‘ in the next ten years . ’
Israel on the other hand has hundreds of bombs and has threatened to use them .
(
Paul George points out that in an interview with Keith Olbermann , Clinton actually alleged that if Iran developed nukes it would be the only such state in the Middle East .
Actually , Israel was the first and if you count Pakistan as both Middle East and South Asia , it would be the second . )
So the statement seemed incommensurate with the known facts .
It was counter - productive because Supreme Jurisprudent Ali Khamenei has denounced nuclear weapons .
Khamenei says that nuking civilians is contrary to the Islamic law of war , which only allows warriors to kill other warriors :
‘ “ Their other issue is [ their assertion ] that Iran seeks [ a ] nuclear bomb .
It is an irrelevant and wrong statement , it is a sheer lie .
We do not need a nuclear bomb .
We do not have any objectives or aspirations for which we will need to use a nuclear bomb .
We consider using nuclear weapons against Islamic rules .
We have announced this openly .
We think imposing the costs of building and maintaining nuclear weapons on our nation is unnecessary .
Building such weapons and their maintenance are costly .
By no means we deem it right to impose these costs on the people .
We do not need those weapons .
Unlike the Americans who want to rule the world with force , we do not claim to control the world and therefore do not need a nuclear bomb .
Our nuclear bomb and our explosive powers are our faith , our youth and our people who have been present on the most difficult scenes with utmost power and faith and will continue to do so . ’
Khamenei ’s quaint chivalry in this age of total war stands in contrast to Clinton ’s chilling contemplation of genocide against 70 million Iranians in retaliation for something they would and could have had no part in deciding .
Mutual Assured Destruction is a security underpinning of the contemporary nuclearized world , but it is a diplomatic weapon that works best by allusion .
If you were an Iranian and you heard Clinton talking like this , would it make you more or less interested in acquiring your own nuclear weapon ?
That is , Clinton ’s rather bloodthirsty pandering to what she thinks the Israel lobbies want to hear is likely actually to produce the opposite of the desired reaction in Iran itself and is most unwise .
Clinton also does not mention that Israel is already protected by MAD because it has several hundred nuclear warheads ( see the beginning of this essay ) .
Senator Clinton is by now just flailing around fantasizing about incinerating children in playgrounds in Isfahan .
Mark 8:36 is relevant here , and I commend it to the good senator : “ For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? ”
As much as people love wireless technology , current systems such as WLAN or Bluetooth have their limits :
They transmit the data with clock rates in the gigahertz range at most , a billion vibrations per second .
In order to increase the quantity of transmitted data , especially for things like high - definition wireless video , clock rates need to become much higher .
Terahertz waves ( 1000 billion vibrations per second ) look like the successor to Bluetooth ; for short distances , like within rooms .
Transmitting power has been an obtsacle to go beyond that .
And they broadcast Futurama .
Excellent choice .
Engineers and physicists of the Terahertz Communications Lab in Braunschweig , a cooperation of the Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt ( PTB ) and the Technische Universität Braunschweig , have successfully transmitted a video signal at a frequency of 300 GHz over a distance of more than 22 meters , and have thus demonstrated that the transmission of user data is possible with terahertz waves .
The unit consisted of an autarkic transmitter and detector units based on Schottky diode mixer technology .
The system performance was characterized with regard to link budget and noise .
For demonstration , analog video signals were used .

Asus informed us this evening that the Eee PC 900 will hit the store shelves in the U.S. on May 12th .
The Linux and Windows XP loaded version of this 8.9 " version of the Eee PC will both cost $ 549 .
The Eee PC 900 has already been released in both Europe and Asia , the U.S. is left as the second fiddle in this release party .
The basic specs for the Eee PC 900 are as follows :
Display : 8.9 " 1024 x 600
Color : Pearl White , Black
CPU : Intel Mobile CPU
Chipset : Intel Mobile Chipset
Memory : DDR II 1GB
Graphics : Intel UMA
Storage : Linux sku:20 GB ( 4GB on board + 16 GB flash module ) XP sku :12GB ( 4GB on board + 8 GB flash module )
Web Cam : 1.3 M
Dimension : 8.86 " ( W ) x 6.69 " ( D ) x .79 " mm~1.33 " ( H )
Weight ( kg ) : 2.18 lbs
( view large image )
At $ 549 the Eee PC 900 bumps up against the price of a budget 15.4 " screen notebook , but it is still far lower in price than other ultraportables out there , which typically start at around $ 1,000 .
Of course , some sacrifices are made such as with the build quality and keyboard quality to get the price down , but reviews so far from Europe and Asia indicate the Eee PC 900 is worth a look and should be equally as popular as its smaller brother , the 7 - inch screen Eee PC 701 .
It was 1943 , and an engineer with Bell Telephone was working on one of the U.S. government 's most sensitive and important pieces of wartime machinery , a Bell Telephone model 131 - B2 .
It was a top secret encrypted teletype terminal used by the Army and Navy to transmit wartime communications that could defy German and Japanese cryptanalysis .
This teletype - encryption machine , known as the Sigaba m134c , was used alongside the Bell Telephone machine found to be leaking signals .
The Bell 131 - B2 used special one - time tapes to create unbreakable codes .
Photo : Mark PellegriniThen he noticed something odd .
Far across the lab , a freestanding oscilloscope had developed a habit of spiking every time the teletype encrypted a letter .
Upon closer inspection , the spikes could actually be translated into the plain message the machine was processing .
Though he likely did n't know it at the time , the engineer had just discovered that all information processing machines send their secrets into the electromagnetic ether .
Call it a TEMPEST in a teletype .
This story of how the United States first learned about the fundamental security vulnerability called " compromising emanations " is revealed for the first time in a newly - declassified 1972 paper TEMPEST : A Signal Problem ( .pdf ) , from the National Security Agency 's secret in - house journal Cryptologic Spectrum .
" There has always been speculation about TEMPEST coming out of the Cold War period , " says Joel McNamara , author of Secrets of Computer Espionage : Tactics and Countermeasures , who maintained for years the best compilation of public information on TEMPEST .
" But the 1943 Bell Labs discovery is roughly ten years earlier than I would have expected . "
The unnamed Bell Telephone technician was the Alexander Graham Bell of a new , secret science , in which electronic eavesdroppers – as far away as hundreds of feet from their target tune into radio waves leaking from electronic equipment to steal secrets .
Building on the breakthrough , the U.S. developed and refined the science in an attempt to spy on the Soviets during the Cold War .
And it issued strict standards for shielding sensitive buildings and equipment .
Those rules are now known to government agencies and defense contractors as TEMPEST , and they apply to everything from computer monitors to encrypted cell phones that handle classified information .
Until now , little has been known about when and how the U.S .
government began trying to protect itself from this threat , and the NSA
paper tells the story well .
Bell Telephone faced a dilemma .
They had sold the equipment to the military with the assurance that it was secure , but it was n't .
The only thing they could do was to tell the [ U.S. Army ]
Signal
Corps about it , which they did .
There they met the charter members of a club of skeptics who could not believe that these tiny pips could really be exploited under practical field conditions .
They are alleged to have said something like : " Do n't you realize there 's a war on ?
We can't bring our cryptographic operations to a screeching halt based on a dubious and esoteric laboratory phenomenon .
If this is really dangerous , prove it . "
So the Bell engineers were place in a building on Varick Street in
New York .
Across the street and 80 feet away was Signal Corps Varick
Street cryptocenter .
The engineers recorded signals for about an hour .
Three or four hours later , they produced about 75 % of the plain text that was being processed–a fast performance , by the way , that has been rarely equaled .
Oddly , the lessons were forgotten at the close of the World War II
– even as the Soviets seemed to have learned to insulate their machines .
In 1951 , the CIA told the nascent NSA that they had been playing with the Bell teletype machines and found they could read plain text from a quarter mile down the signal line .
In 1962 , the Japanese , then our allies , attempted just that by aiming antenna on top of a hospital at a U.S. crypto center , according to the article .
And the Russians did the same – planting not just the famous 40 microphones in the U.S. 's Moscow embassy , but also seeding mesh antenna in the concrete ceiling , whose only purpose could have been stealing leaked energy pulses .
The principal of the TEMPEST attack is deceptively simple .
Any machine that processes information – be it a photocopier , an electric typewriter or a laptop – has parts inside that emit electromagnetic and acoustic energy that radiates out , as if they were tiny radio stations .
The waves can even be picked up and amplified by nearby power lines , telephone cables and even water pipes , carrying them even further .
A sophisticated attacker can capture the right frequency , analyze the data for patterns and recover the raw information the devices were processing or even the private encryption keys inside the machine .
Decades ago the FCC has set standards prohibiting electrical devices from interfering with other ones , concerned merely about noise .
These days we know that computer monitors , audio cables and other information machines like credit card machines in restaurants actually emit sensitive information .
Outside of the government , almost nothing was known about how such eavesdropping worked until 1985 , when a computer researcher named Wim van Eck published a paper explaining how cheap equipment could be used to pick up and redisplay information from a computer monitor .
The first mentions of TEMPEST began in the mid 60s , and Gene Hackman introduced the Faraday cage to the public in the 1970s in the classic eavesdropping movie The Conversation . *
In addition to explaining how the U.S. discovered compromising emanations , the declassified NSA document provides a surprising historical snapshot of Cold War espionage techniques , says McNamara .
" It is ... interesting that CIA rediscovered the vulnerability in
1951 and work on countermeasures soon followed , " he says .
" One can assume that the U.S. Intelligence Community also begin using the electronic surveillance technique against foreign powers during this same time frame .
From the 1953 and 1954 dates mentioned in the document , it seems the Russians were aware of the vulnerability by then , and were taking measures to secure their communications equipment .
Pennsylvania University science professor Matt Blaze also expressed some amazement at the Bell researchers discovering as early as 1943
that digital equipment leaked information .
" The earliest reference to emissions attacks I 'm aware of ... is Peter Wright 's recollections , in his book Spycatcher , of following around spies in 1950 's London by tracking the local oscillators of their radio receivers , " says Blaze .
" But that 's analog , not digital . "
The NSA did not declassify the entire paper however , leaving the description of two separate , but apparently related , types of attacks enticingly redacted .
One attack is called " Flooding " and the other " Seismic . "
The idea of being able to steal plain text of an encrypted message using earthquake sensors ?
Stinkin ' cool .
THREAT LEVEL anxiously awaits the back story on that attack to be told .
* Professor Matt Blaze questions whether Hackman was in a Faraday cage in The Conversation , since Hackman was able to transmit out .
He was definitely in some sort of metal cage , but I may have jumped to conclusions about its Faraday - ness .
Under pressure during Tuesday ’s debate , Hillary Clinton hinted that she might release her tax returns earlier than “ once I become the nominee , ” a schedule that had drawn criticism from Barack Obama and the press .
But aides speaking with the media the next day retreated from that opening :
“ As is customary , as the Democratic nominee Sen. Clinton will release her tax information in April at tax time . ”
Clinton ’s loan to her campaign of $ 5 million raised questions about where the money came from , particularly since the candidate filed a joint return with her husband , who , no longer a politician , is less transparent financially .
The concern is over whether a back door to financing the campaign has been created , a fear that is perhaps less warranted given the financial difficulties of the Clinton campaign .
But , as the saying goes , if you ’ve got nothing to hide … .
Bush Military Spending Recalls Stalin And Hitler
Bush Military Spending Recalls Stalin And Hitler
By Sherwood Ross
The relentless increases in Pentagon spending President Bush has pushed through since taking office recall the actions of Hitler and Stalin prior to the outbreak of World War Two .
Both European dictators escalated their war machines and both dictators showed little concern when their domestic economies and workers ’ incomes suffered as a result .
In 1933 , his first year in power , Hitler pushed up German arms spending from less than a billion to four billion Reichsmarks .
He jumped that figure to 10 billion in 1936 ; 17 billion in 1938 and 38 billion in 1939 , the year he invaded Poland .
Similarly , Stalin steadily boosted military spending in the Thirties from two billion rubles to 41 billion rubles .
As historian Richard Overy put it in “ The Dictators ” ( W.W. Norton & Co. ) :
“ The share of defence spending in the state budget in Germany reached 54 % in 1938/39 ; in the Soviet Union it reached one - third of the budget by 1940 . ”
The commitment to military spending , he says , “ was historically exceptional ” and created by the late 1930s “ something approaching a war economy in peacetime . ”
Today , President Bush is right up there with the European dictators .
His military spending has soared from $ 291 billion to a lavish $ 515 billion and he ’s proposed a stunning $ 651 billion next year .
The Friends Committee on National Legislation , of Washington , D.C. says that 44 cents out of every dollar in his proposed record 2009 budget will go for war , compared with 2.2 cents for social programs .
Typically , he calls for cutting 47 education programs while handing the generals 8 % more .
Under Bush , U.S. military spending is now roughly equal to the combined total of all other nations .
What ’s more , Uncle Sam is the world ’s Number One arms peddler , selling about half of all weapons bought by the developing nations , and showing few scruples about sales to dictators .
The Center for Defense Information reported last year that U.S. arms sales to 25 countries it studied increased 400 percent over 9/11 .
Of course , the two criminal 20th Century dictators did n’t build their war machines for sport , and neither has Mr. Bush .
By mutual agreement in 1939 , the “ CommuNazis , ” as they were known , carved up Poland , Hitler invading from the West and Stalin from the East .
In the summer of 1941 , Overy writes , Hitler remarked “ what one needs and does not have , one must conquer . ”
That ’s not much different from Bush ’s view of Middle East oil .
Having made war on Iraq based on lies and having subjugated that small country by force , Bush is pushing its cabinet to put through a giveaway law to profit the oil companies .
And he ’s threatening oil - rich Iran with an attack .
As for the quality of life on their home fronts , Stalin and Hitler did n’t mind sacrificing their people one bit to a war economy .
Neither of them tolerated labor unions .
In the Kremlin - controlled economy , real hourly wage rates in 1937 were 40 % lower than in 1928 and by 1940 they were down another five to ten percent , Overy writes .
There was food on the table for Hitler ’s workers but few consumer goods to buy .
In 1932 , consumer industries accounted for 40 percent of Germany ’s investment .
By 1938 , this had shrunk to only 17 percent , a trend similar to that in Russia under Stalin .
Under Bush , the real wages of Americans have stagnated as well .
Despite their fantastic productivity , U.S. workers are earning less today in real dollars than five years ago .
And restrictive laws make union organizing tougher than ever .
As ever more Americans lose their jobs and homes , favored Pentagon contractors reap record profits , not necessarily from operating on free market principles .
As the Center for Public Integrity noted , only one of the top 10 defense contractors “ won a majority of its contracts through full and open competition .
All the rest collected most of their contract dollars through sole source contracts or other no - bid procedures . ”
CPI identified Lockheed Martin , Boeing , Raytheon , General Dynamics , Northrop Grumman , United Technologies , General Electric , Carlyle Group , and Newport News .
One might think in these hard times --- when the price of a gallon of gas has doubled in good part because of the Iraq war --- the White House might ask this supine Congress for a windfall profits tax on the oil majors .
With two former oil executives holding the two top jobs , though , that ’s not likely to happen , any more than the Iraqi people will ever see the profits from their oil resource as long as George Bush is president .
The bottom line is that the people both of Iraq and America are suffering from a needless war to profit USA ’s military - industrial complex .
Recall that Thomas Jefferson opposed a standing navy because he had observed the way the Royal Navy pushed Great Britain to wage wars .
If you do n’t remember that bit of history , it ’s safe to say President Bush does n’t , either .

Every action in company ought to be done with some sign of respect to those that are present .
With that mild but firm assertion begins a little book of self - improvement that George Washington copied down as a teenager .
There followed 109 rules , and by the time Washington had written them all into his notebook " “- in what was probably the equivalent of a homework assignment -- he had taken them to heart , and he attempted to follow them for the rest of his life .
The pamphlet was called " Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation "  " “- a shorter title than many of today 's self - help guides .
It was composed by French Jesuits in 1595 , and later rendered into English .
It 's unclear how the publication reached America , but its effect on Washington 's character and behavior were profound , according to historian Richard Brookhiser , who published an annotated edition of " Rules of Civility . " 
Our age is not unique in its hunger for self - improvement .
" Eighteenth - century Americans were eager for good advice , especially advice concerning their conduct , "  Brookhiser wrote in the introduction .
But you 'll find none of the self - affirming " I 'm good enough , I 'm smart enough , and doggone it , people like me ! "  among Washington 's 110 precepts .
Instead , there are reminders to respect the personal space of others , and that one should take pains not to embarrass another .
The rules spell out the delicate dance of how to be a well - mannered guest and host and , in the class - conscious society of Washington 's day , how properly to behave in the presence of one 's superiors and inferiors .
The value of many of the rules is still obvious .
Others are amusing because conditions of life are so changed .
All are worth considering .
So , with concern for your self - improvement on this Presidents ' Day Weekend , here are 14 more :
1 . Sleep not when others speak , sit not when others stand , speak not when you should hold your peace , walk not on when others stop .
2 . Spit not into the fire , nor stoop low before it , neither put your hands into the flames to warm them , nor set your feet upon the fire , especially if there be meat before it .
3 . Kill no vermin , as fleas , lice , ticks etc. , in the sight of others .
If you see any filth or thick spittle put your foot dexterously upon it , if it be upon the clothes of your companions put it off privately , and if it be upon your own clothes return thanks to him who puts it off .
4. Read no letters , books , or papers in company , but when there is a necessity for the doing of it you must ask leave .
Come not near the books or writings of another so as to read them unless desired , or give your opinion of them unasked .
Also look not nigh when another is writing a letter .
5 . Let your countenance be pleasant but in serious matters somewhat grave .
6 . Shew not yourself glad at the misfortune of another though he were your enemy .
7 . To one that is your equal , or not much inferior , you are to give the chief place in your lodging , and he who " ˜tis offered ought at the first to refuse it , but at the second to accept though not without acknowledging his own unworthiness .
8 . Mock not nor jest at anything of importance , break no jests that are sharp , biting , and if you deliver any thing witty and pleasant , abstain from laughing thereat yourself .
9 . Let your conversation be without malice or envy , for " ˜tis a sign of tractable and commendable nature , and in all causes of passion permit reason to govern .
10 . Speak not of doleful things in a time of mirth or at the table ; speak not of melancholy things as death and wounds , and if others mention them , change if you can the discourse .
Tell not your dreams , but to your intimate friend .
11 . Be apt not to relate news if you know not the truth thereof .
In discoursing of things you have heard name not your author .
Always a secret discover not .
12 . In company of those of higher quality than you , speak not till you are ask'd a question , then stand upright , put off your hat , and answer in few words .
13 . Speak not evil of the absent for it is unjust .
14 . Make no show of taking great delight in your victuals .
Feed not with greediness .
Eat your bread with a knife ( i.e. cut it into small pieces ) , lean not on the table , neither find fault with what you eat .

Jarvik May Have Used Body Double in Ads Congressional committee suspects Lipitor ads featured athletic stand - in .
Feb . 7 , 2008  --
A congressional committee believes the creator of the first artificial heart may have misled viewers by using a body double in advertisements for a popular cholesterol drug he endorses .
Dr. Robert Jarvik has worked as a spokesperson for the top - selling anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor .
Congressional investigators believe a body double was hired to make Jarvik look more athletic in television ads for the drug , according to the committee .
In one commercial , Jarvik rows across the water in a canoe .
The committee gave ABC News an exclusive look at a letter it sent in January to Lipitor manufacturer Pfizer , asking for " contracts , e-mails , correspondence , and scripts of television and print advertisements " featuring Jarvik .
It also wanted to know how much Jarvik was paid for his pitchman position .
The committee gave Pfizer until Jan. 21 to respond .
When he appeared on " Good Morning America " last month to respond to the controversy , Jarvik did n't give a specific dollar value for his role .
" I 'm paid an amount that I think for a celebrity ad would be considered a lot by most people , " he said .
But a contract uncovered in the probe has revealed Jarvik was guaranteed $ 1.35 million for appearing in the advertisements .
The chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce , Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich . , has been a vocal critic of the ads because he said Jarvik " appears to be giving medical advice , but apparently he has never obtained a license to practice or prescribe medicine . "
" The question here is , ' How is it being marketed ?
How is it being advertised ? ' "
In the commercials , Jarvik says , " Lipitor is one of the most researched medicines .
I 'm glad I take Lipitor , as a doctor , and a dad . "
Yet the man famous for his medical breakthrough is unable to legally prescribe medicine , because he is not licensed to practice medicine .
Jarvik ended his training after medical school instead of completing a medical internship .
" I am a medical scientist , not a practical physician , " he said on " Good Morning America " last month .
" I think it 's very upfront .
I am a doctor .
I have long experience with heart disease . "
In the ads Jarvik insists he wants to protect people 's hearts — but with cheaper generic drugs currently available on the market , the committee is looking to protect peoples ' wallets .
Once the Democratic primaries conclude in early June , the superdelegates will make their final decisions and put either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama on a clear path to the party 's presidential nomination , says Howard Dean , chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
Dean told U.S.
News that he expects the unpledged delegates to clarify their positions by July 1 , after the final 10 nominating contests are held , and that will make the national convention in Denver much less contentious than is now feared .
Dean said last week 's agreement between the DNC and party leaders in Florida and Michigan " moved the ball a lot . "
Even though there still is n't a consensus on how to qualify the delegates chosen in those two states ' disputed earlier - than - allowed primaries , Dean said all sides now agree that it's in the best interest of the party and the eventual nominee to seat the delegates in some way .
What happened last week was n't a smashing breakthrough , since it involved little more than expressions of goodwill , an agreement by the DNC to seat the two delegations somehow , and a commitment to allot them hotel rooms in Denver , the convention site .
What heartened Dean was the notion that , as in international diplomacy , such small " confidence building " steps often lead to bigger steps later .
It appears that holding new primaries has been ruled out by Florida and Michigan officials , but Dean says the two early states still must be penalized for breaking the party 's rules and holding their primaries too early .
Breaking those rules resulted in the disqualification of all their delegates , and all the major presidential candidates agreed not to campaign in the disputed states .
Clinton ended up winning the popular votes in both and now wants to count their delegates , but Dean is holding to his view that both primaries were fatally flawed .
Obama , leading narrowly in the overall delegate count , agrees .
But Dean says a compromise is possible .
There is , for example , increasing discussion within the party of allowing each delegate chosen in the primaries to cast a half vote and each superdelegate to retain full voting privileges .
The big stumbling block remains getting agreement from the Clinton and Obama campaigns .
" The candidates are not in the mood to negotiate right now " as they continue to fight it out state by state for the nomination , " Dean said in the interview .
Dean predicted that in the end , there will be a compromise before the convention , but " nobody will be completely happy . "
After the next round of contests , starting with Pennsylvania 's primary April 22 and ending with Puerto Rico , Montana , and South Dakota in early June , the remaining uncommitted superdelegates ( elected officials and party activists chosen independently of primaries and caucuses ) , Dean predicts , will move toward a candidate .
And he says that will put Clinton or Obama firmly in the driver 's seat .
" We have about 800 unpledged delegates , and about 460 of them have already said who they 're going to be for , so if the other 340 would say who they 're going to be for , then we'd be all set , " Dean told ABC's This Week on Sunday .
" That 's been going on .
Nobody has protested that so far .
So I think that should continue to go on , people should continue to say who they 're for , and the process should move forward .
But the most important people of all are the voters .
We 've got ... nine states plus Puerto Rico left to go , and I think the voters ought to have their say . "
Dean also argued that the long fight for the Democratic nomination has been good for the party because it has generated intense excitement and drawn hundreds of thousands of new voters to the party .
" We 're going to be in great shape , " Dean said on ABC .
" I know the higher echelons of the Democratic Party are wringing their hands over this .
The fact of the matter is we 're having record turnouts everywhere .
We get to run an election in Pennsylvania four or five months before the big election .
We have n't done that in years .
I think this is actually going to make it easier for us to win as long as we keep the party together . "
For the future , Dean told U.S. News , he favors a coordinated effort by the Democratic and Republican parties to avoid the current confusing and much - criticized system for choosing nominees .
Among the changes that should be considered , he said , are making sure the primaries and caucuses are n't held so early and are n't so bunched up .
Holding the nominating contests according to a longer schedule would make for a more deliberative process , many party veterans believe .
But Dean said both parties must work together because no amount of reform will be effective unless the parties are " in sync . "
A team of scientists has completed a carbon dioxide emissions inventory of the United States plotted down to 100 - square - kilometer chunks .
That means that the NASA - and Department of Energy - funded scientists can detail emissions across all 9 million square kilometers that compose the United States .
For a full explanation , check out the video that Purdue 's Kevin Gurney put together , which features a number of other excellent CO2 visualizations .
Andy Revkin , the New York Times ' environment - beat writer , put a memorable headline on a post about the video , calling it , " Breath of a Nation . "
The work , known as The Vulcan Project , has already yielded a significant discovery : Previous CO2 estimates that used population as a proxy for emissions overestimated the Northeast 's greenhouse - gas generation , while underestimating the coal - heavy Southeast 's contribution .
Now , given the opposition of the Southeast 's congressional delegations to climate - change action , I 'd like to see the new emissions map matched up with House and Senate districts .

( CNN ) --
Come election time in November , voters in five states might have a decision to make as big as whom to elect president .
Ballot initiatives have been proposed in Arizona , Colorado , Missouri , Nebraska and Oklahoma that would give voters the chance to decide whether they want to do away with affirmative action in government - funded projects and public schools .
Ward Connerly , who heads the American Civil Rights Coalition -- a nonprofit organization working to end racial and gender preferences -- and the main backer of the ballot initiatives , says the 37 word initiative would read :
" The state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment , public education or public contracting . "
" It would forbid any state or local agency or special district from engaging in preferential treatment , " Connerly said .
Watch what Connerly says about the initiative »
Connerly , who is of African - American and American Indian descent , said affirmative action causes resentment .
He criticized cases in which a Caucasian student might be denied a college slot in favor of a black student with a lower grade - point average .
" It 's foolish not to think that the kid who is turned away is not going to ... resent that , " Connerly said .
Connerly , who grew up in Leesville , Louisiana , said he experienced oppression because of his skin color during his youth .
" If it was wrong when I was born in '39 ... it 's wrong now , " he said .
" If it was wrong to do it against a brown - skinned man , it 's wrong to do it against a white man . "
Shanta Driver , National Director of United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund -- an organization dedicated to integrating minority students in educational institutions -- said the ballot initiative is a mistake .
" It places us in the position of denying ... equal opportunity to blacks and Latinos , " she said .
Watch Driver explain her position on the initiative »
Driver and other affirmative action supporters believe this movement would erase the progress made since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
" It 's obviously a huge step backwards , " she said .
The ballot initiative , dubbed the Civil Rights Initiative , has already passed in California , Michigan and Washington .
Some 140,000 signed petitions have been submitted in Oklahoma .
Backers in the remaining four states have until late March to early July to collect enough signatures for the initiative to be on the November ballot .
If successful , the ballot measures would cut off tax dollars for programs offering preferential treatment based on gender or race .
The issue may have some support in the Supreme Court .
In June , justices threw out public school choice plans that relied on race .
That leaves many states uncertain about whether their affirmative action policies will stand up in court and against political scrutiny in this election year .

Crude Oil = $ 120
Well , almost .
The May 2008 Futures contract hit $ 119.90 -- that 's the all time high for Crude Oil .
>
>
Here 's a quick excerpt from Bloomie :
" Crude oil rose to a record $ 119.90 a barrel in New York as the dollar dropped to an all - time low against the euro , prompting investors to purchase commodities as an inflation hedge .
The dollar touched $ 1.60 per euro for the first time after European Central Bank policy makers signaled they may raise interest rates because of inflation .
Oil 's 24 percent surge this year has pulled gasoline and diesel fuel to records , weighing on an economy already reeling from a credit crisis .
Crude oil for May delivery advanced $ 1.69 , or 1.4 percent , to $ 119.17 a barrel at the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Futures reached $ 119.90 today , the highest since trading began in 1983 .
Prices are up 88 percent from a year ago .
The May contract expired today .
The more - active June futures contract rose $ 1.35 , or 1.2 percent , to $ 117.98 a barrel . "
There is a huge contingent that simply refuses to believe in the rally in Oil -- since around $ 40 .

I believe .
I believe this is no different than any of the other messes Wall Street has helped create .
There is underlying economic demand but even that is only marginally based on reality .
Wall Street pushes because it realizes that additional economic demand has no other choice than to pay whatever it is .
That is , until demand finally hits a wall .
Some people believe this is demand - pull .
Haha .
The premium put in by massive changes in the participation level of futures market by ' managed ' money is responsible .
Finally it appears some in the government have realized there is a stench associated with this as well .

Brad Friedman Byon
4/14/2008 , 1:08 pm PT
Wow ...
We 're blown away by this article in today 's Beacon News .
[ Article now hidden behind paid archives , here 's a local repost . ]
It begins this way :
The little blog that did
For four years , Bradblog.com has reported on voting machine problems April 14 , 2008
By Dan Campana dcampana@scn1.com
If the mass media ever did its job , Brad Friedman could go back to his former life , the one before 2004 when election scandals became his full - time vocation ...
We 're greatly appreciative of Campana 's coverage .
Not only because he 's very kind to us , but because --- as a total of four of his stories filed over the last two days reveal --- he has actually done what so few corporate journalists seem able to do today : Actual journalism .
Before we saw the piece mentioned above today , we had kind words about his coverage yesterday of the wholly under - reported Hart InterCivic federal fraud suit .
But beyond that detailed piece , his follow - up story today and " related coverage " offered on both days has been top - notch .
Here are links to each of his stories today and yesterday ...
That , ladies and gentlemen , is what journalism is supposed to look like .
And yes , if we had a few more hundred ( we 'd settle for a few more dozen ) like Campana , we'd be more than thrilled to go back to what we were doing prior to falling into this remarkable American Nightmare .
We look forward to the day we can take down our shingle entirely and leave all of the heavy lifting to folks like him who actually get paid to do this stuff .
( But until then , whatever support you can afford to help keep us going is appreciated ... You are all we 've actually got .
So , please see below , and please keep spreading the word . )

" I 've been at Bear for 11 years and I want to vomit , " said a Bear Stearns employee , who described himself as a partner , as he entered the striking seven - year - old octagonal building two blocks from Grand Central Terminal .
To add insult to injury , someone had taped a $ 2 bill to the revolving glass doors at the 46th and Vanderbilt Avenue entrance -- some gallows humor on the bargain - basement $ 2 - a
share price JPMorgan Chase paid for Bear Stearns .
" Where is the $ 2 bill ? " joked one employee , " I might need that tomorrow ! "
At the Madison Avenue entrance , Ray Schmitz , a Realtor with Coldwell Banker , was betting that with the value of their stock options in tatters , Bear 's employees might soon be looking to
trade their luxury homes for something a little easier on the budget .
" You have to go where the business is , " Schmitz said as he handed out business cards .
" A lot of these people are going to lose their jobs , and most of their wealth will have been in share options .
They 're soon going to be looking for a cheaper place to live . "
But generally , the mood was somber as employees arrived at work .
The fear of job losses among bankers , traders and other staff comes as Wall Street grapples with a deepening credit
crisis and the threat of recession in the United States grips financial institutions .
" It 's an awful day , everyone is really upset , " one employee said .
Street vendor Hassan El Ashkar , who sells coffee and bagels outside the bank 's Manhattan headquarters , had his morning rush at 6 a.m. , much earlier than usual .
" Of course I am worried , " he said .
" These are my customers .
My customers came earlier than usual today , to see what 's going on .
They 're all worried about their jobs . "
Bear Stearns , roughly 30 percent - owned by its staff and proud of its above - average level of inside ownership , employs 14,000 people .
JPMorgan is paying just $ 2 a share for the 85 - year - old Bear , valuing the fifth - biggest U.S. investment bank at $ 236 million -- just 1/15th of its market value on Friday and way below its
record share price of more than $ 172 last year .
The bailout punctuates an eight - month slide in Bear Stearns ' fortunes as investors lost confidence in the smallest of the major securities houses and one known as an aggressive
trader in credit and mortgage markets .
" It 's going to be grim today .
I do n't know if I 'll have a job at the end of today , " said a Bear research assistant .
" The price is crazy .
Someone who'd won the lottery could have paid
that price . "
There was also anger and frustration at how the situation was handled .
" I 'm sad and I 'm angry at my own senior management , " said one employee .
To add insult to injury , Bear Stearns does not offer payouts , known as ' golden parachutes , ' for executives in the event of it being taken over .
A Tokyo financial industry recruiter , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue , said he knew firsthand of Bear Stearns employees looking to jump ship .
" We 're already seeing people looking at moves from within that organization , " he said .
Although the takeover means JPMorgan adds Bear 's prime brokerage and asset management business to its franchise , it is likely to sell other parts of the business and many jobs could
disappear .
In Asia , there was some relief that the bank had been rescued .
" It 's not a bankruptcy , that 's the good news , but JPMorgan is going to come out today and tell us what they think of us , " the Singapore Bear Stearns employee said .
" It 's better to be
out here in Asia than to be in New York . "
In London , where Bear employs 1,500 staff in the financial district of Canary Wharf , some employees were less willing to speak , only confirming that they worked for the bank .
One Bear Stearns employee , when asked for a reaction snapped : " You must be joking .
What are you , a vulture ?
Get a life . "

The rarest of all cats , the beautiful Iriomote Cat resides solely on the Japanese Iriomote island , located some two hundred kilometers off the coast of Taiwan .
It has lived for millennia on this small island ( less than three hundred square kilometers ) and has evolved to suit the habitat and environment of this particular place .
Owing to similarities in appearance , for some time the Iriomote Cat was considered a subspecies of the Leopard Cat .
Recent evidence however indicated that the Iriomote Cat separated from the Leopard Cat in evolution couple of million years ago .
A small wild cat , the Iriomote Cat weighs around twelve pounds and is around one a half to two feet long ( excluding tail ) .
Males are slightly larger .
Fur is brownish with a number of dark brown spots that coalesce to form stripes which run along the body length .
Legs are short in comparison to body size and tail is bushy .
Toes are slightly webbed and claws lack a complete sheath , helping the cat in its aquatic pursuits of prey .
Ears are short and rounded indicating that the Iriomote Cat primarily uses sight in its movement and hunting .
A variety of prey is taken by the Iriomote Cat .
Its small body size enables it to move quickly through the underbrush and successfully hunt small mammals , birds , insects and fish .
It is a solitary and territorial feline that frequently marks its territory ( larger in case of males ) and is primarily nocturnal , particularly in summer .
Mating season is twice an year and pregnancy lasts two months after which a litter of one to four kittens is born .
Prionailurus Iriomotensis , the Iriomote Cat is critically endangered .
Less than one hundred remain in the wild .
Plus they appear to be breeding with feral cats , leading to dilution of their gene pool .
Despite preservation of their territory on the island , the cats frequently stray out of the reserve area and are hunted / eaten as a delicacy !
Apple logo .
Whether you are a Mac person or a PC person , even the briefest exposure to the Apple logo may make you behave more creatively , according to recent research from Duke University ’s Fuqua School of Business and the University of Waterloo , Canada .
In work to be published in the April issue of the Journal of Consumer Research , Professors Gavan Fitzsimons and Tanya Chartrand of Duke , and Gráinne Fitzsimons of Waterloo , found that even the briefest exposure to well - known brands can cause people to behave in ways that mirror those brands ’ traits .
“ Each of us is exposed to thousands of brand images every day , most of which are not related to paid advertising , ” said Gavan Fitzsimons .
“ We assume that incidental brand exposures do not affect us , but our work demonstrates that even fleeting glimpses of logos can affect us quite dramatically . ”
To assess the effects of brands on behavior , the researchers selected two competing brands , both well respected by consumers , with distinct and well - defined brand personalities .
“ Apple has worked for many years to develop a brand character associated with nonconformity , innovation and creativity , ” said Chartrand , “ and IBM is viewed by consumers as traditional , smart and responsible . ”
The team conducted an experiment in which 341 university students completed what they believed was a visual acuity task , during which either the Apple or IBM logo was flashed so quickly that they were unaware they had been exposed to the brand logo .
The participants then completed a task designed to evaluate how creative they were , listing all of the uses for a brick that they could imagine beyond building a wall .
People who were exposed to the Apple logo generated significantly more unusual uses for the brick compared with those who were primed with the IBM logo , the researchers said .
In addition , the unusual uses the Apple - primed participants generated were rated as more creative by independent judges .
“ This is the first clear evidence that subliminal brand exposures can cause people to act in very specific ways , ” said Gráinne Fitzsimons .
“ We ’ve performed tests where we ’ve offered people $ 100 to tell us what logo was being flashed on screen , and none of them could do it .
But even this imperceptible exposure is enough to spark changes in behavior . ”
Other than their defined brand personalities , the researchers argue there is not anything unusual about Apple and IBM that causes this effect .
The team conducted a follow - up experiment using the Disney and E !
Channel brands , and found that participants primed with the Disney Channel logo subsequently behaved much more honestly than those who saw the E !
Channel logos .
“ These experiments demonstrate that most any brand that has strong associations with particular traits could have the capacity to influence how we act , ” Chartrand said .
The researchers note practical implications of their work for both consumers and marketers .
“ Instead of spending the majority of their money on traditional print and television advertising , companies with established brand associations such as Apple may want to give serious consideration to shifting more marketing resources to product placement opportunities and other forms of outreach that emphasize brief brand exposures , ” Gavan Fitzsimons said .
And consumers should be aware that they are susceptible to influences they may not detect and use this knowledge to their advantage .
“ If you know you need to perform well on some task , say something athletic , you may want to surround yourself with images and brand logos that represent success in athletics , ” Gráinne Fitzsimons said .

Undoubtedly you ’ve heard of the Congo and most likely know that it ’s located somewhere in Africa .
However for most people - especially in the United States - their knowledge of the Congo is summed up in that single sentence .
But … people usually get a feeling when thinking about the Congo , even though they know so little .
It ’s wild , packed with jungle , untouched by civilized man , enigmatic and dark .
Blockbuster hits like Congo and outbreaks in the area of the dreaded Ebola virus – one of the ( if not THE ) most heinous viruses known to man – continue to portray the image of a surreal enchanted land .
It is a region of the earth shrouded in mystery as well as misery .
It is as if Heaven and Hell were forced to co-exist in one place with the most extremes of good , beauty , and bounty … as well as the most extreme of evil , death and deprivation .
700 years ago when the Divine Comedy was written , Dante passed a sign before he entered Hell : “ Abandon all hope ye who enter here . ”
Many could argue the sign might be more appropriate for the entrance to the Congo .
What is it about the Congo that captures imaginations ?
The Congo is similar to an ancient , decrepit , haunted house .
Far away from the rest of humanity , up on a hill , with lightening flashing in the background and a ” Beware ” sign hanging crooked on the banging iron gate that leads on to the property .
Of course there is one difference – the Congo is full of abundant beauty - which makes it all the more surreal .
Well first what exactly is the Congo ?
It ’s actually a river in Southwest Africa .
Just as Buzz Aldrin will never have the fame of Neil Armstrong the Congo River is eclipsed by the Nile River for the longest river in Africa .
After the Nile though , no river in Africa comes close .
And the second longest river in Africa happens to run straight through the second largest rainforest in the world .
The River is so popular two countries were named after it – which makes it a little confusing for conversation .
The country to the Northwest of the Congo River is known as the “ Republic of the Congo , ” or simply Congo - Brazzaville as that is their capital city which is perched right on the edge of the mighty Congo River .
This country deserves a story all its own , but this entry is going to focus on the much larger country to the Southeast – the “ Democratic Republic of the Congo ” or Congo - Kinshasa ( the capitals of the two countries sit directly across the Congo River from each other ) .
It is this country that this entry focuses around because its history is unrivaled and it is soaked in blood .
The Congo River got its name from the old Kingdom of Kongo which has its origins as far back as 1400 and lasted up until 1914 – or at least thats what Wikipedia says .
I ’m admittedly no expert on early Congo history but it does seem the Kingdom was relatively sound until it came in contact with the Europeans who began using them as slaves turning their own kingdom on itself .
Considering the resulting temperament of the region hence , it is reasonable to wonder how many innocent lives could ’ve been saved if the “ civilized ” white Europeans and Americans would ’ve greeted the natives they met as simply another culture to learn from .
What I mean by that is this :
The year is 1885 and European ego has ballooned to epic proportions as whole nations are making claim to owning the entire continent of Africa – absolutely with no regard to natural or native boundaries .
This is something important enough to stop and look at real quick – just so we do n’t underestimate what a truly global issue this is .
This map of Africa is about 30 years too late but this is the same basic idea – it was just a free - for - all land grab with absolutely no consideration towards the native population .
This may ring some bells of similarity in America .
There was serious cultural damage done from this white European display of prideful ignorance .
I ’m not pointing any fingers as all the culprits and initial victims are long dead and anyone who still is living in those days is clinging to a dying past .
There can be some direct blame laid , as those who initiated the use of such brutal force were directly involved – and in 1885 one of the largest private properties known to man was acquired – and it happens to be the single blue area in the African map – right in the center .
The King
There once was a King of a small European country who had a terrible problem .
As a good King should he wanted his country great , and he racked his brains night and day trying to come up with a way to make his country great .
And finally his eureka - moment came and an epiphany had been realized .
He thought about it – where could he get more stuff for his country without bothering his immediate neighbors ?
And then it dawned on him – Colonies !
The idea probably made his heart flutter near the ceiling .
It made perfect sense – the King probably hit his palm to his forehead asking why he did n’t think of it sooner but there was still another problem that he did n’t anticipate .
When he proposed his idea to Congress and his subjects there was virtually no interest .
You see – this small European Country was Belgium and the King was none - other than King Leopold II .
The people and government of Belgium wanted nothing to do with colonies in an age where democracy was beginning to flourish and the importance of the King was slowly eroding away .
But King Leopold II was not deterred , he made a private company , had the area around the Congo River surveyed , and in 1885 all the other greedy countries recognized the Congo Free State as owned by only King Leopold II and nobody else – it is why the Congo is split in half at the river , he ‘ gave ‘ the northern half to the French for sovereignty of the much larger south .
You see – he tricked his own subjects in to thinking he was just going to survey the land when in reality he was simply trying to grab an entire country as his sole property – and he succeeded with bribes .
As a private block of land 1/ 4 the size of the United States the King went straight away to using it to create a profit .
Seeing as no Europeans were living in the Congo Free State King Leopold II absentmindedly declared the entire land as “ vacant . ”
And thus the arduous anguish - ridden history of the people of the Congo began .
The cruelty of the first European colonists in the Congo Free State is noteworthy .
King Leopold
II was serious about making sure the “ vacant ” land turned him a profit – in any form necessary .
If natives were encountered it was essential to use them for forced labor – slavery .
Ivory which cost innocent animal life and rubber which was collected via slavery were the two main exports of King Leopold ’s II new land .
King Leopold II even allowed rival slave traders run parts of the Congo Free State .
Back in Belgium the King kept a tight lid on things – but not tight enough .
His people were mad at the debt he had created by investing so deeply into this African colony he tricked everyone about acquiring in the first place .
On top of that rumors were being spread about the brutal rule he had over the colony .
After all – very few people who went there rarely came back , most were not allowed to leave the country .
But politics crept up on Leopold and he was forced to let an independent group assess how he ran the country .
And in 1908 there was international outrage towards the King and his forced labor – even the United States condemned it - slavery was apparently last century news ( at this point it was only acceptable to restrict equal rights ) .
Thusly the Western World virtually appointed the country of Belgium the new ruler of the Congo Free State to tone down the massive human rights abuses – and thus the Belgian Congo was born ( which is why that is the name on the above map ) .
The Belgian people were not happy with their King during his reign and in 1902 he was almost assassinated .
When he died in 1909 he was booed during his burial parade .
I do not know the extent of the cruelty the King was responsible for and I do n’t think anybody will ever know for sure ( one of those eerie sayings people always say when countless have been murdered ) .
I ’ve read figures as high as 10 million innocent lives were taken under the brutal dictatorship that surpassed the brutality that even “ regular colonies ” employed .
In 2005 a statue of King Leopold II was erected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the capital of Kinshasa ( formerly Leopoldville ) for historical purposes , by the time the sun rose the next morning it had been removed .
For more information on Leopold ’s rule check out the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad as this seems to be the authority everybody points to ( though fiction the book is largely based on what the author saw while in the Congo ) .
But believe it or not King Leopold II and his creation of the Congo Free State is only the background of the tale I want to tell .
Katanga
I find it hard to convey the complexity surrounding the Congo ’s situation without mentioning the province of Katanga .
During Leopold ’s rule they were a modern African Kingdom that held their own against both Leopold ’s men to the north as well as the encroaching British from the south .
A Kingdom had arisen around the same time as Leopold ’s men were entering the Congo from the West .
It was known as the Yeke Kingdom and its leader was known as Msiri .
Msiri was not a particularly benevolent leader but I can’t help but be impressed with the native attempt at demanding independence in a way that was every bit as economically brutal as Leopold .
Being at the heart of the African continent they were an ideal trading post which produced slaves and copper .
Their regional influence grew so large that the Kingdom quickly shared a sense of independence from the European encroachers .
Despite the sense of unity Leopold ’s men killed Msiri and took Katanga for their own profit – classic Leopold style .
However this Kingdom seemed to have infused the area with a sense of brutal independence that ran through the decades .
Independence and the Rise and Fall of Patrice Lumumba
The Belgian Congo , ruled by the country of Belgium , did not carry on the brutal rule of their King but instead the more socially acceptable forms of discrimination rife with colonies those days .
Katanga proved to be a mineral rich area of the Congo and the Belgian ’s profited nicely from Leopold ’s greed .
While primary schools apparently were built in abundance a stark absence of secondary or higher education was found .
And still , even though no longer run by Leopold , the country kept its borders as closed as possible to retain ignorance and protect from independent influence .
The Africans were encouraged to get service jobs they were n’t allowed to have the higher paying jobs that would support a country .
All of this kept the unwanted , bastardized , adopted Congo child in a non-threatening and profit - producing state ( much like todays genetically modified pigs – helpless independently , bountiful for the ones who made it that way ) .
But by the time the late 1950 ’s occurred the natives of the Congo became increasingly more demanding about Independence as word leaked of other African countries becoming independent .
The logistics of Independence had become nightmarishly large in size .
The complete lack of higher education would leave a country helpless to care for themselves in a modern world now broadcasting information across oceans and flying fighter jets .
Yet the native Congolese were becoming violent and the Belgian government had lost almost all favor – faced with no other option in January of 1960 Belgium promised independence in June of the same year .
The total number of university graduates was 30 , only 136 completed secondary education , and the country only had 600 priests to help tend to the countries needs – no doctors , no secondary school teachers , no army officers .
With Congo ’s native culture ravaged by Belgium and its leaders during the last 70 + years of occupation and forced to live under “ civilized ” order the Congolese sat at the eve of their Independence in complete ignorance on what it takes to run a “ civilized ” nation .
The only history they had really known of a “ civilized ” nation was that of a very pushy and unpleasant country – which they were about to get rid of ( or so they thought – there is little civilized action in a civilized world ) .
Five days before independence a non-executive president and Prime Minister were elected – Joseph Kasa - Vubu and Patrice Lumumba respectively .
Both were leaders in the Congolese demand for independence .
While the new King of Belgium – King Baudouin – came expecting to hear praise for his great Uncle – King Leopold II – he was greeted by a blasé president and a vehement prime minister .
Lumumba chose his words with justifiable passion :
“ We have known sarcasm and insults , endured blows morning , noon and night because we were ‘ niggers ’ …
We have seen our lands despoiled under the terms of what was supposedly the law of the land but which only recognised the right of the strongest .
We have seen that this law was quite different for a white than for a black : accommodating for the former , cruel and inhuman for the latter .
We have seen the terrible suffering of those banished to remote regions because of their political opinions or religious beliefs ; exiled within their own country , their fate was truly worse than death itself …
And finally , who can forget the volleys of gunfire in which so many of our brothers perished , the cells where the authorities threw those who would not submit to a rule where justice meant oppression and exploitation ”
Each word was undoubtedly justifiable and thus the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) was born , independent from imperial rule , and alienated by their lofty oppressors .
Immediately there were problems .
The army started to get vocal about their low wages and began to riot , Lumumba immediately blamed the Belgian ’s accusing them of inciting rebellion doing little to address the actual problem at hand .
While the Belgian ’s did keep the overhead jobs from the Congolese it was Lumumba himself who demanded the 6th month plan to independence instead of the Belgian ’s proposed 4 year plan .
Mutiny quickly became rampant and whites were beaten , raped , and insulted .
A mass exodus of the white population quickly fled in the thousands and many of the Congolese feasted on their first taste of lustful bigotry and oppression – it was their turn to inflict the harm on the whites .
During this time many of the Congolese quickly converted to everything they ’ve ever hated about the Belgian rule .
Of course the Belgian ’s have left no other model of rule around leaving disaster inevitable .
As Lumumba rushed about his new duties taking care of this national crisis while refusing any aid from the Belgians , a sly politician named Moise Tshombe declared the mineral rich Katanga ( remember Katanga ? ) an independent state , adding one more thing for Lumumba to handle .
Katanga quickly became a unified unit at the earliest of the DRC ’s independence .
Lumumba , having nowhere to turn , looked towards the United Nations ( UN ) to help and within days foreign troops were maintaining public safety and civilian task forces were created to run public services .
Of course at this point Belgian troops had also intervened to ensure the safety of their ex-patriots and this in no way pleased Lumumba .
Lumumba insisted that the UN expel the Belgian troops and the UN refused to intervene figuring the Congo needed all the help it could get .
Infuriated Lumumba demanded the UN remove Belgian troops or he would invite the Soviet ’s to intervene .
It ’s 1960 .
Lumumba happened to press the one button that would possibly get the United States even marginally interested in a remote African backwater – they called Commie !
And the United States saw this as a very serious threat because a year previously a revolution had just taken place off the tip of Florida and a young Fidel Castro began his rule of the small country of Cuba .
The DRC could be another country that could fall to the dreaded rule of communism and so Lumumba was rushed to Washington where the CIA attempted to persuade him not to make such a rash decision .
By August the United States was calling Lumumba “ a Castro or worse , ” “ irrational , ” a “ mad dog ” and “ psychotic . ”
The UN called Lumumba crazy , threatening , demanding , irrational and claimed he acted like a child .
Within two months of independence the United States and UN were completely fed up with Lumumba ’s rule and seemed more than happy to let the communists deal with him .
In fact we get a rare glimpse into how powerful politics really can get .
President Eisenhower authorized the CIA to “ eliminate ” Lumumba .
I ’m not joking .
“ There was a stunned silence for about 15 seconds and the meeting continued , ” Johnson recalled .
Belgian leaders rife with embarrassment came to similar conclusions : “ The main aim to pursue in the interests of the Congo , Katanga , and Belgium , is clearly Lumumba ’s elimination definitive . ”
With the Western World attempting to manipulate the potentially malignant Soviet country and Katanga attempting to secede using military might and an army that has mutinied Lumumba ’s options were thin but he continued to attempt to manage the country showing no signs of letting go .
To add to Lumumba ’s poor image a recent military expedition to Kasai ended with hundreds of Baluba tribesmen murdered and 250,000 displaced refugees .
UN Soldiers looked on with strict orders not to use weapons aside for self defense .
What about Kasa - Vubu – the non-executive President ?
What was he doing during all this time ?
Kasa - Vubu had quickly grown accustomed and comfortable with his new life of luxury and was not in any hurry to stir any political trouble .
But when approached by the U.S. , the Belgians , and fellow Congolese Kasa - Vubu was virtually forced to act – but not before Lumumba did – and he quickly accused Kasa - Vubu of treason and dismissed him as president .
Lumumba ’s end came from an unlikely source – from a trusted personal aide that Lumumba promoted to army commander – his name was Joseph Mobutu ( left ) .
Supported by the CIA , UN , and many frustrated Congolese citizens the 29 year old Joseph Mobutu declared that he was neutralizing all politicians and assuming power until the end of the year .
The 35 year old Lumumba quickly disappeared in to hiding .
On December 1st , 1960 - 6 months after he became the first acting Prime Minister of the DRC - Lumumba was found crouching in the back of a pickup and arrested .
After he was thoroughly beaten he was sent straight to Leopoldville ( the capital later renamed Kinshasa ) where Joseph Mobutu ruled with UN and U.S. support .
And in that tropical December of 1960 along the muddy banks of the Congo River somewhere in Leopoldville Patrice Lumumba lay at the mercy of Joseph Mobutu .
A former minister claimed to have seen Mobutu spit in Lumumba ’s face and declare : “ Well !
You swore to have my skin , now it is I who have yours . ”
The Death of Patrice Lumumba
You did know he was going to die , did n’t you ?
It ’s common knowledge to not expect a happy ending in Africa and Lumumba ’s death , unfortunately , is not exceptional compared to the ends of many African ’s that dare to toil in African politics .
In fact it might not even be worth talking about if it was n’t so scandalous and if the resulting aftermath was n’t so powerful –
Earlier I spoke of Lumumba killing hundreds of Baluba tribesmen as well as displacing 250,000 refugees .
Well after a month of being detained it was decided that Lumumba and two of his colleagues be transported to a different city – Elizabethville .
The guards picked for this transportation were Baluba – Baluba that were ready for revenge .
The entire 6 hour flight was filled with unimaginable beatings and when the plane landed and the torture should have ended ( should it have started ? ) there were Katangese soldiers and Belgian officers waiting for him .
They took up the beatings where the Baluba soldiers left off and transported them to an empty house .
You see – Elizabethville is located deep in the Southern Congo – in Katanga ( remember Katanga ? ) .
Tshombe , the man who declared independence while Lumumba was in charge , still kept Katanga in an autonomous rule from the rest of the Congo and was supported by the Belgians .
Tshombe and Belgian police commissioner Frans Verscheure were in charge of the detention of Lumumba and his colleagues and spent the afternoon taunting and beating Lumumba further .
Tshombe and Verscheure eventually got tired of torturing Lumumba and went home to get drunk .
Tshombe ’s butler noticed that his employer came home that evening covered in blood .
By 10 P.M. many were drunk enough to have murder on there minds .
Lumumba and his colleagues were never to see another sunrise – and they probably did n’t want to .
Hauled 30 miles out of town the three men were ripped out of the pickup truck to face open graves in front of them .
“ You ’re going to kill us , are n’t you ? ” Lumumba asked .
“ Yes , ” Verscheure replied .
And that night – January 17 , 1961 – a group of drunken Katangese soldiers and Belgian officers murdered 3 men ( Lumumba being the last ) who spent the day being tortured .
Then they were buried .
As sobriety started to settle in panic began to engulf the group and cover stories started to be spun .
It was the Belgians that worried particularly as what had just occurred would be found entirely unacceptable to the Western culture in which they so belonged .
A political prisoner was in their hands the previous day and now they had no way of accounting for him .
The following night after the diabolical deed had occurred some Belgians dug the cadavers back up , took them 120 miles away , hacked them up , and dissolved them in a vat of sulphuric acid .
Then their bones were ground up and scattered on the return trip to Elizabethville so as to lose all connections with their cold blooded murder .
Nevertheless , this event was witnessed by too many people and the secret was not kept .
The murder of Patrice Lumumba made him into one of the most famous political martyrs of modern times .
The Congolese were vehement towards the Belgian ’s for continuing to meddle with their independence and murdering their first leader .
In addition this news was one of the few maniacal secrets the Congo had released to the world and staged protests occurred across the globe in over 30 cities .
The support behind Lumumba came from the concept that he was just a poor guy trying to free his country from colonialism and for that simple reason – murdered – and the country that just “ gave ” them independence was responsible .
Belgium was globally chastised – which I imagine , in some way , is exactly what Lumumba would want his death to do – hurt the image of those who had put him and his people in such a fetal state .
Now we know Lumumba could not blame all of the misfortunes on Belgium , for he definitely created his fair share of oppression and impossible demands … but I ca n’t help but wonder – with the way Belgium treated the Congolese , no matter how the transition phase occurred ( 6 months OR 4 years ) , and no matter WHO was put in position of power – whether the Democratic Republic of the Congo was just set up to fail .
Civil Strife
Mobutu assumed power of Leopoldville with the avid support of the U.S. and UN but was not the favored leader in the country .
The Soviet Union was aiding a Northeastern uprising ( red ) , Tshombe still was attempting succession of Katanga in the Southeast aided by the Belgians still ( green ) , and in the Southwest diamonds had been found in the area of Kasai and the locals began to guard the area from the rest of the country – the Belgians also meddled here ( blue ) .
Mobutu , in short , was only in charge of the Western portion of the country and the capital ( yellow ) .
Most of the rest of the country started to divide itself .
By 1964 Katanga had failed to become an independent state and Tshombe became acting Prime Minister of the entire DRC .
That same year a revolt occurred in the Eastern ( red ) portion of the map and Tshombe had to recover half the land of the country he had previously tried to secede from .
Mass executions began of the Congolese people who were deemed “ intellectuals ” or “ counter - revolutionaries . ”
It was this section of the country that supported Lumumba the strongest and they began executing the “ counter - revolutionaries ” at the foot of Lumumba statues .
The United States and Belgium were in panic , if the revolution succeeded communist Lumumba supporters would cover the country leaving only what is vile and distrustful to U.S. and Belgian interest .
The two countries supplied the Western half of the country with combat aircrafts , transport planes , counter - insurgency experts and technicians .
The DRC was undoubtedly a pawn in the global chess game of Democracy vs. Socialism ( leaving only despotism in the wake ) .
More confusion , killing , torture , and power struggles occurred in the decimated country until the Eastern Soviet rebellion was managable .
All in all an estimated one million people had died during the rebellion .
By 1965 Mobutu had officially declared himself president ( a popular thing military heads were doing all over Africa at this time ) .
Personally I do n’t understand how any man could take the position Mobutu did but he seemed to become severely hardened after the chaos of the previous 5 years .
Dissidents were quickly eliminated .
Mobutu instilled public hangings and brutal treatment of those who did not completely support him which quickly stabilized the country .
One must truly look at the situation and legitimately ask whether if Mobutu did not take these actions if another million would ’ve died .
Of course it ’s rhetorical as we ’ll never know , but what we do know is a little more on how the United States played a role in this very real and nightmarish mess :
The United States and its Relationship with the Congo
“ General , if it had n’t been for you the whole thing would have collapsed and the Communists would have taken over , ” President Kennedy was quoted as saying to Mobutu in 1963 about his initial assertion of power .
“ I do what I am able to do , ” Mobutu responded while asking for military equipment , training , and parachute training for himself .
The President granted his request and gave him a command aircraft for his personal use and a permanent US Air Force crew to go with it to boot .
Also he was kept on the CIA payroll and was paraded around as an exotic and powerful leader by those in the United States government .
In 1970 Nixon praised Mobutu and told him “ there are things we can learn from you . ”
On top of that Nixon pushed for more investment in the country .
By 1974 the U.S. and Europe had over $ 2 billion ( 2,000,000,000 ) invested in the country celebrating Mobutu – a dictator the likes of which the world has only rarely seen – as the appropriate leader to manage the country of their “ investment . ”
I hate to bring U.S. involvement in on the history of an African country but it is obvious from the above facts that the United States government were far more involved with the politics of the DRC than they probably should have been or care to openly admit .
The people of the United States were ignorantly unaware that the leader of a remote African country was zipping around in a tax - paid jet with a tax - paid crew and a tax - paid staff and was being injected with tax - paid cash .
Morally the concept of a leader of a country being on another country ’s payroll is just another Westernized form of stunting a culture and country of people .
While the United States certainly did not acknowledge the intricate details of the situation in the Congo they blanketly placed them in a category of “ Potential Soviet ally ” and insisted on menacing in the countries very internal and bloody business .
Of course the Soviets were no better grubbying their fingers in the Congo pot as well aiding the stir of an uprise that cost one million lives .
The United States brought shame upon themselves as a country becoming so worked up at Lumumba calling for Soviet help .
If you remember country ’s total graduates of both higher education and secondary education totaled less than 200 in 1960 .
What honest threat would a jungle nation with a handful of people educated on the “ civilized ” world that was ripe for civil war cause if they had become communist ?
Logic says none at all .
And if democracy was really their goal why did they support a military dictator which was neither socialist nor democratic ?
He was despotic !
In an age where the prevailing argument of American policy is “ We were noble enough to free the Iraqi people from a terrible dictator , ” it goes completely ignored that the United States had supported harsh military dictators for decades ( including Saddam originally ) .
As I argued in my entry on The Bush Administration with another harsh military dictator – Samuel Doe – the United States has never been interested in “ freeing people ” or “ democracy ” so much as it has been interested in strict obedience .
And Mobutu provided just that .
Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga
Just as we ’ll never know what Michael Jackson would be like without gross amounts of fame we will never know what Joseph Mobutu would ’ve been like without gross amounts of power .
As the economy started to tentatively increase in the 1970 ’s Mobutu started to let his ego expand .
After all the previous ruler could n’t even rule for 6 months and he had ruled it for almost a decade with progress .
He often began to be seen wearing a leopard - skin hat .
On top of that he had decided to change his name in 1971 from Joseph Mobutu to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga ( the title of this section ) which meant something along the lines of “ the all - powerful warrior who , because of his endurance and inflexible will to win , will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake . ”
Not exactly modest nor really encouraging .
It was also during this time Leopoldville ( the capital ) became Kinshasa , Elisabethville ( where Lumumba met his torturous end ) Lubumbashi , and Stanleyville ( where the 1964 rebel revolt took place ) became Kisangani .
Lastly Mobutu decided that the name Democratic Republic of the Congo was outdated and changed the name to Zaire .
Today many of your decade - old maps still have the Democratic Republic of the Congo labeled as Zaire as it continued to be named such until 1997 .
Another dicatatorial action Mobutu took was creating a single party to eliminate political opposition .
In case you were ever interested in what the trademarked official way of removing all political rights from the masses – it is the creation of a single party .
This way things are simple – they become your way … or the rape , torture , abusive , deprivation , prison way .
And the opposition party is usually preoccupied with one of the listed things if you know what I ’m saying .
So he started a single party and , of course , it was the duty of the party to follow , as he deemed it , “ Mobutuism . ”
The concept behind it was basically that the belief of sharing power is absurd and having only one leader is the most important thing – and what that leader says goes or else punishment will ensue .
Mobutu had become as oppressive as the Beglian colony was by taking on this paternal position for his people .
Also this is known as something – Mobutu was creating a cult of personality .
The name changes to himself and the country , the creation of a single party , naming things after himself – all of these things are signs of when your ego can no longer bathe in the Pacific Ocean anymore .
From this point on nobody was allowed to have a European name in the country and priests baptizing anyone with a European name will receive a 5 year jail sentence .
European suits were banned and fawning over the “ Saviour of the People ” ( his title , not mine ) was encouraged .
In fact songs and dances were constantly being put on for him .
Places where he lived and grew up became national pilgrimage places or places of “ high meditation . ”
His staff began calling him a prophet .
A former prime minister – Nguzu Karl - i- Bond – later wrote in his memoirs the following about Mobutu :
“ Nothing is possible in Zaire without Mobutu .
He created Zaire .
He fathered the Zairian people .
He grew the trees and the plants .
He brings rain and good weather .
You do n’t go to the toilet without the authorisation of Le Guide .
Zairians would be nothing without him .
Mobutu has obligations to nobody , but everybody has obligation to him .
As he said to me on August 13 , 1977 , in front of three witnesses : ‘ Nguz ’ , there ’s nothing I have to do for you ; on the contrary , I have made you whatever you are . ' ”
And the American government still supported him .
Having satiated himself with fame Mobutu turned his head toward fortune to devour .
With the simple ease of just vocalizing it Mobutu seized a massive amount of foreign businesses .
In a simple decree he acquired 2,000 businesses and redistributed them to friends and family .
Mobutu himself was the boss of plantation conglomerate with over 25,000 employees .
Mobutu virtually owned the country – not dissimilar to his Belgian predecessor .
During the 1970 ’s it was estimated that one - third of total national revenues was in one way or another at his disposal .
Mobutu immersed himself in all aspects of business in his country bloating himself with wealth while his country slowly slipped back in decline .
Whether it was copper , cobalt , diamonds , banking , stocks , business ownership , and surely much more Mobutu siphoned the profit guiltlessly for his arbitrary whims .
In the 1980 ’s the average individual on the Forbes 500 list made about $ 400 million a year .
Mobutu was estimated to be making $ 5 billion making him one of the richest men in the world at the time .
And the American government still supported him .
The consequence ?
National disaster .
Mobutu could not handle all of the capital he had acquired making himself rich making Zaire ’s budding economy begin to slowly rot .
As poverty spread from the mismanaged businesses greed enveloped anyone with any power .
Teachers and hospital staff went unpaid for months .
It was Mobutu who helped coin a new form of government in which Zaire was a leading example – the term was a kleptocracy – klepto commonly know as someone who commonly steals – so a kleptocracy is a form of government that commonly steals .
People with all levels of power took more than their fair share leaving the masses with little else but poverty .
It came to a point where nothing could be accomplished without a bribe .
It is at this time that we can see the Congolese people have become indistinguishable with their oppressors as corruption permeated the country turning neighbor on neighbor for a petty level of power .
“ If you steal , do not steal too much at a time .
You may be arrested , Yibana mayele – Steal cleverly , little by little . ”
This is a documented quote directly from Mobutu himself .
While corruption was on the minds of the leaders the country was impoverished .
Medical staff , teachers , and other workers stopped working because they were receiving no wages .
Those who did receive wages were getting little more than 10 % of their value in 1960 ( their independence ) .
Hunger , disease , and malnutrition were the product of the greed .
Mobutu modeled the practice of many ruthless African dictators .
The first step is to gorge on as much profit from your country in any way you please .
The second step is to invite foreign investors to gorge on the money they bring as well .
The third step is to comply with foreign inquiry to missing funds until they try to get you to stop gorging , then ignore them and wait to see what they do .
And this is exactly what Mobutu did , threatening the lives of those who came to his country to monitor fair business practices .
Mobutu constantly was shifting his friends and enemies to make sure nobody ever got too close .
And the American government still supported him .
I stress this so many times because this is a clear cut case where the United State blatantly and flagrantly ignored the concept of democracy and freedom for the sake of convenience .
The United States only saw the Congo one - dimensionally .
The Congo was a block of land in Africa that was not allowed to supply its wealth to the Soviet Union – and that ’s it .
If the nation dove in to despotism , debt , greed , despair , torture , wars , and suffering that was acceptable so long as they were not supplying their wealth to the Soviet Union .
In this regard the political term for him was a “ friendly tyrant . ”
In case that does n’t make sense I ’ll gladly break it down for you .
Mobutu is still a tyrant and does all the terrible , horrible , awful things a tyrant does to his own people – however – he is friendly towards us , which makes us feel safe , so we give him money for doing that to keep him that way .
That is what the term “ friendly tyrant ” means .
How much money did the United States give to Mobutu ?
Between 1965 and 1988 the United States gave Mobutu $ 860 million of taxpayer money .
Mobutu maintained friendship with the United States administration after administration .
Into the Reagan and Bush Administration Mobutu was still solidly not helping the Soviet Union in a Cold War gone lukewarm .
The suffering was obvious , the only unity maintained was through Mobutu ’s iron fist of greed , and keeping him in power curdled the tense situations as they began to root .
I bring all this up to ask the philosophical question – is it right for one nation - state to put a leader of another nation - state on their payroll ?
Does this not undermine the very responsibility of a leader ?
Where is this leader ’s loyalty when he is being paid by another country ?
Who could possibly argue that a leader can stay loyal to his country while on the payroll of another ?
The United States and the Soviet Union created so much global tension out of an ego issue it reverberated negatively around the world – the Congo being one of the worst affected .
Taxpayer money went for decades to a man whose only job was to suppress , and he was praised for it :
“ I have come to appreciate the dynamism that is so characteristic of Zaire and Zairians and to respect your dedication to fairness and reason .
I have come to admire , Mr. President , your personal courage and leadership in Africa . ”
“ Zaire is among America ’s oldest friends , and its president – President Mobutu – one of our most valued friends .
And we are proud and very , very pleased to have you with us today . ”
Both of the above are direct quotes from President George Bush I ( There is something eerily familiar about having to use Roman Numerals for identification of a specific leader and its correlation with oppression ) .
The history of the United States and Mobutu is simply unacceptable behavior if it were happening in America , and there is absolutely no legitimate reason ( so this excludes discrimination and hate - mongering ) why this should be happening because of Americans elsewhere .
It would be as if one high school superintendent paid off another high school superintendent to make all their students and staff submissive to him , which may include robbing them , not paying them , refusing them any decent medical attention , refusing to have any autonomy whatsoever … all so the original superintendent can feel like he ’s doing a good job eliminating potential ( not actual even yet ! ) competition .
From Dwight Eisenhower to George Bush I all the presidents supported Mobutu and supplied him with cash to continue his plundering and oppression – it was little other than that by any standards at all – and Bush says those complete false positive things about him .
The feeling was mutual however with Mobutu sharing positive feelings on George Bush I himself :
“ As regards George Bush I ’ve met him thirteen times .
We know each other from way back .
He was in charge of the CIA and knew Zaire ’s problems backwards .
He received me at his home in Maine with his mother , wife , and children and grandchildren .
I met him again recently at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito .
He is an intelligent , open and sensitive man , with strong convictions . ”
I find these quotes so essential because they are documented facts .
There was absolute friendship between a dictator who many would largely agree was worse than Saddam Hussein , yet even at this time Bush was fighting that very man for being a ruthless dictator .
The hypocrisy is blatant and the fact that this is not acknowledged as a historical lesson goes to show that there is a strong level of national oppression within the United States let alone what type of oppression the government encourages outside of the country .
When the Soviet Union fell there was little reason to keep Mobutu on the United States payroll and his reputation was catching up with him .
The United States began to distance herself from Mobutu until eventually the government denied Mobutu a visa into the United States .
No longer was he welcome less than a decade after the breakup , one of the United States “ oldest friends , ” perhaps Bush meant “ oldest tools . ”
In fact – the only one to speak up for Mobutu anymore in America happened to be Pat Robertson , the famous televangelist ( of all people ) , giving an argument for Mobutu to visit the United States .
Though Pat Robertson has done a good job covering his tracks there have been quite a few accounts claiming that Mobutu allowed him to mine diamonds in his country , which is probably the reason for their forged relationship .
Robertson seems a man willing to profit from anything – religion to an oppressed nation – regardless of moral character .
France and the Rwandan Genocide
In a small country a fraction of the size of Zaire along its exotic Eastern border a conflict was occurring .
A group known as the Tutsi were about to be murdered in such large amounts the word genocide had to be pulled out of the closet before anything was seriously done about it .
The Tutsi , though a minority group , tended to be wealthy and hold positions of power .
The Tutsis had an aristocracy and enjoyed a higher style of living than their Hutu counterparts .
The Hutu were the majority in this country known as Rwanda and some Hutus felt indignant over this Tutsi rule .
Rwanda and Burundi have had ethnic tensions between the Hutu and the Tutsi stemming back to the 1960s .
Political leaders have been assassinated , executed , and murdered by Hutu and Tutsi alike .
The Tutsi people were exiled for over 30 years creating one of the largest refugee communities in Africa .
The Tutsis who remained in Rwanda ( while the exiles planned for their return ) were forced to carry an ethnicity card , given quotas determined by the Hutu government , Tutsi women were not allowed to be married to Hutu men , and the leader of it all – Juvenal Habyarimana – kept a photograph of a Tutsi hut in flames in his presidential mansion .
But now it is the early 1990 ’s and the Tutsi had earned their way back in to Rwanda but not without continued ethnic tension .
Habyarimana was not willing to share the power with the returning Tutsi and began to stir up dehumanizing hate in which only the most desperate and lowly of people do .
Hutu supremacists began organizing death squads and murdering the Tutsi in cold blood .
As all this was going on next door Mobutu was immersed in troubles of his own .
After 30 years of rule Mobutu had little to show for it .
Since 1988 the economy had shrunk by 40 % and his money was worthless .
Per capital gross domestic product in 1993 was $ 117 , about 65 % lower than in 1958 – before independence .
Mobutu ’s old stealing grounds were in decline and people across the world had begun to wise up to Mobutu ’s destructive , deceitful , ignorant ways .
Copper , cobalt , diamonds and gold all were mismanaged , not being produced , or being smuggled .
Mobutu had reaped what he had sewn .
Distrust permeated through every level of government and when cohesion looked possible Mobutu incited ethnic tensions just like his neighbor , Habyarimana , to the East .
But the worst of it all was that he had virtually no foreign friends that could provide him with his insatiable desire for wealth and global leverage .
The United States would n’t talk to him anymore , the World Bank stopped funding him as they saw $ 9 billion sink into the murky depths of the Congo never to reappear , it really looked as if it were only a matter of time before Mobutu met the fate of his predecessor – Lumumba .
Enter France .
First it was Belgium who could not help but get their fingers dirty in Africa , followed by the Americans , and now the French saw the Congo as a part of their imperialist vision .
If one country asserted more dominance on the continent of Africa than any others – it would be France .
France was very diligent in not only maintaining but spreading the Francophone culture .
To France Africa was divided into two sections – Francophone Africa ( map on left ) – and then everybody else .
France did n’t really regard Africa as a totally separate culture or continent from their own – they regarded Africa , literally , as their own backyard .
To them defending Francophone Africa was defending France – it was defending France ’s backyard .
And what was France defending Francophone Africa from ?
Why Anglophone Africa of course – the British influence could not encroach .
Treating a continent of people like a backyard once again shows the immaturity Africans had to deal with when encountering their European counterparts .
Everything from the French language to French influence were of the highest priority in Francophone Africa - everything else coming second – and I mean everything .
Jaques Foccart , the leader authority of French policy on Africa for 40 years and met Mobutu personally , had explained France ’s interest on the topic of Zaire :
“ [ Zaire ] is the largest country on francophone Africa .
It has considerable natural resources .
It has the means of being a regional power .
The long - term interest of France and its African allies is evident . ”
No longer was Zaire considered a country with desperate people and a flat - lined economy in dire need of compassion and stability with a ruthless leader .
It was viewed simply as a potential area of profit and if France continued to support its leadership – whoever it was – they can benefit from any economic or regional power gained from it .
However unfortunate for the French what was brewing in the region was not potential profit but genocide .
In fact France supplied Habyarimana with troops which he used to repress his opponents ( Mobutu also had supplied Habyarimana in the past with troops and weapons ) .
Rwanda was also part of the precious francophone empire and acknowledging the genocide that Rwandan Hutus were facilitating would not look good for France .
But the crisis continued to grow , Tutsis continued to be slaughtered and the West , especially France , was slow to react .
When Habyarimana was assassinated in April of 1994 the genocide took full effect .
For Mobutu though he had found a new purpose – a new way to manipulate power again .
The Rwandan crisis was getting out of hand and Mobutu gladly opened the border to his country for refugees to come spilling in .
However , this time , the refugees were not Tutsi – they were Hutu .
The whole reason the crisis began in Rwanda was because Tutsis were demanding to return to the government that exiled them 30 years prior .
The Hutu elite used dehumanization , discrimination , and then outright murder to refuse the Tutsi entrance back in to their original country of residence .
So while the Tutsi continued to push southward militarily – triumphantly taking back the country in which they originally belonged – while Hutus cowardly murdered civilian Tutsis and fled the country claiming Tutsi created genocide - not the actual Hutu created genocide that was occurring .
As the Hutus poured in to all of Rwanda ’s bordering nations international outcry reached a new level .
Images of Hutus exiling themselves from the country turned in to the images of the holocaust .
Indeed hidden within this traveling band of refugees were the actual people directly responsible for the blood - lust atrocities .
As CNN streamed the images of the Hutu refugees the hearts of people across the world went out to them even though some were facilitating the genocide .
When Belgium wanted to send in troops to stabilize the situation it was France who refused it .
When a regional meeting set up to discuss Rwanda was going to be in “ anglophone ” Tanzania both Mobutu and France blocked the move .
Meanwhile innocent civilians were being murdered and raped in the street .
Both Mobutu and France held out their power in an orgy of greed for power and wealth .
It was from the Hutu refugee camps inside Zaire that facilitators of the genocide safely plotted their next blood - spilling scheme .
The Congolese Wars
With all the political greed in the region the locals were getting overwhelmed with the refugees and ethnic tensions began to flare between the locals and the refugees .
Due to Mobutu helping out the Hutu genocidaires the new Tutsi- instated government decided to attack the genocidaires and march all the way west to the capital of Zaire – Kinshasa – and remove Mobutu from power .
At this time in 1996 Mobutu was in ill health , had no money , and could not afford a military to defend himself .
The rebellion started in the East at the Rwandan border and then spread West slowly .
Mobutu watched as his country began to dissolve in front of hi eyes .
Province after province joined in on the rebellion with Mobutu virtually powerless to stop it – even Katanga joined in .
This was known as the First Congolese War .
The last time the East Congo started rebelling it was 1965 and the United States was supplying Mobutu with all he needed to suppress the uprising .
In fact , I did not mention this earlier , Fidel Castro and Cuba even got involved .
Having personal vendettas against American imperialism in Cuba , Castro sent Che Guevara to the Eastern Congo to meet a man named Laurent - Désiré Kabila who claimed he had an army to Che to train .
Che was a professional guerrilla soldier ready to train an uprising for the good of the people .
Che was disgusted to meet an unmotivated army with an unmotivated leader that demanded money and put in little effort .
The revolution Che had planned was a disaster and Che headed straight back to Cuba .
About 30 years later it was again , Laurent - Désiré Kabila , who the Tutsis trusted to take over the Congo .
It was this man , Laurent - Désiré Kabila , who Che said on his return to Cuba :
“ He let the days pass without concerning himself with anything other than political squabbles , and all the signs are that he is too addicted to drink and women ”
Che also claimed Kabila lacked any “ revolutionary seriousness .
So what a surprise it might have been to Che ( had he not been murdered himself later on in life ) to see that it was indeed Kabila ( with major help from Tutsi Rwanda ) that ran Mobutu out of the country .
Mobutu escaped with little more than his frail life .
After 32 years of playing ruthless dictator of possibly the most saddest country on Earth Mobutu fled on a plane that being riddled with bullets – never to return .
As the remainder of Mobutu ’s army made it across the Congo River to Congo - Brazzaville in 1997 the leader of the months - long assault , Laurent - Désiré Kabila , assumed leadership and returned the name back to the original ( though confusing ) name of independence : the Democratic Republic of Congo .
If genocide and a war was n’t enough to deal with in a single decade a second war was quickly ready to break out .
The Second Congolese War has been the largest conflict since World War II and also Africa ’s largest war involving 8 nations .
Though Kabila could have never taken over Kinshasa without the help of the new Tutsi Rwandan government Kabila was short in patience when Rwanda tried to control the Congo .
Kabila made sure to thank them and then curtly made them leave .
Shortly thereafter fighting flared up and the Rwandan and Ugandan government started to feed off the Northeast parts of the Congo plundering their wealth .
Other nations got involved on both sides and things did not significantly change until 2001 when Kabila was assassinated .
Immediately his son – Joseph Kabila was instated .
By 2003 Uganda and Rwanda withdrew and the war was officially over .
Of course Rwanda is still bitter and continues to support rebel action within the borders of the Congo .
And these shallow actions continue to perpetuate the corrosive and rotting culture of violence the citizens of the Congolese have been forced to endure since its inception and almost completely due to international stimulation .
Joseph Kabila ’s leadership is still in its infancy .
Certainly his task is daunting and unlike his father or any of his predecessors Joseph Kabila is described as a shy man .
Perhaps a leader without an ego can help unite the country and it is true that he is attempting peace talks with the Rwandan Tutsi rebels .
Unfortunately it was only August 2007 when rebel and government forces fought in the province of Kivu displacing almost a million people .
Is it possible that Joseph Kabila will be able to restore even the most basic safeties to the country without keeping the citizens in a fetal state ?
I certainly do n’t know but I hope the best of intentions and the wisest of choices are guiding him .
Conclusion
So why did I bring up this long disastrous history of a nation nobody cares about unless they live in it ?
For a few reasons :
Some people attribute Africa ’s problems to race .
Many people seriously believe that skin color affects intelligence even in the slightest .
I found the history of the Congo to be typical to the history of many African colonial nations .
Unprepared for independence and mettlesome once independence is achieved African leaders , especially in the case of the Congo , have a hard time not being used like a pawn .
In this case we saw the first serious mistreatment of people occur by a white European leader .
The history of the Congo is one of the infinite amount of testimonies that no one race is superior to any other .
Many of the people and countries involved with the Congo were bolded upon their first mention in this entry .
This is to show how Congo ’s strife - ridden history has little to do with internal affairs , though there can be improvement on all ends .
The Congo ’s story is a testament to the theory that Western powers have direct influence with the most poverty - stricken and strife - ridden areas on the planet .
Specifically the United States befriending this ruthless tyrant , Mobutu , for decades because of his obedience and yet in the same breath call Saddam out as being a ruthless dictator .
The United States has a hard time recognizing its mistakes and befriending and paying Mobutu was one of them .
The Congo ’s story is a testament to the idea that the United States only looks for obedience in a foreign leader as opposed to serving “ freedom ” to the citizens – and to use that as an excuse to be extra dubious .
To bring attention to a region of the world that is constantly ignored by telling its fascinating , if not gory , history .
Normally I link more references than I did in this entry and a lot you must take my word on to believe .
Why should you take my word for it ?
Because virtually everything I ’ve written was paraphrased from the book listed below , The Fate of Africa by Martin Meredith which is probably one of the most comprehensive looks at Africa and its history since independence .
I strongly urge anyone to read it who wants to know why civilization has not been as kind to all parts of the world as it has been to the West .
I would love any more information that is insightful to read on the Congo and I encourage comments on this entry
The Fate of Africa by Martin Meredith – excellent book .
@packetsniffer : " " The waste produced by the country 's 20 million pigs is slowly choking the environment "
Oh give me a break .
Now nature is harming itself ?
We 're doomed for sure . "
There 's nothing natural about 20 million pigs in that small of an area .
Nor is there anything particularly natural about the way we raise beef or chicken these days .
Just because pig piss is a " natural " substance , does n't mean 20 million gallons of urea in a small area is n't going to mess things up .
Anyone that 's driven through Norco on I - 15 , South of Los Angeles , knows what I mean .
Your eyes burn from it .
Think of it as a larger version of your dog creating brown spots on your lawn .
It was Heesters ' first performance in his homeland since the 1960s
There were protests and tight security around the theatre in Amersfoort where Johannes Heesters appeared .
Although Heesters insists he never espoused Nazi politics , he performed for Adolf Hitler and visited the Dachau concentration camp .
Correspondents say many Dutch people have never forgiven him .
" He kept singing for the Nazi regime , for the Wehrmacht , and he earned millions , " said Piet Schouten , representative of a committee formed to protest against Saturday 's performance .
" We have a problem with that on behalf of all the victims , " he told national broadcaster NOS .
Johannes Heesters , born Johan , began his career in Amsterdam in the 1920s and moved to Germany in 1935 , where he enjoyed a successful career .
Heesters was never accused of being a Nazi propagandist , and the Allies allowed him to continue performing after the war .
He was booed off the stage in Amsterdam when he previously tried to stage a comeback in the early 1960s .
Since then he has performed in other countries , notably Germany and Austria .
About one - third of America ’s eighth - grade students , and about one in four high school seniors , are proficient writers , according to results of a nationwide test released on Thursday .
The test , administered last year , showed that there were modest increases in the writing skills of low - performing students since the last time a similar exam was given , in 2002 .
But the skills of high - performing eighth and 12th graders remained flat or declined .
Girls far outperformed boys in the test , with 41 percent of eighth - grade girls scoring at or above the proficient level , compared with 20 percent of eighth - grade boys .
New Jersey and Connecticut were the two top - performing states , with more than half their students scoring at or above the proficient level ( 56 percent in New Jersey , 53 percent in Connecticut ) .
Those two and seventeen other states ranked above New York , where 31 percent of students wrote at the proficient level .
North Pole Could Be Ice Free in 2008
You know when climate change is biting hard when instead of a vast expanse of snow the North Pole is a vast expanse of water .
This year , for the first time , Arctic scientists are preparing for that possibility .
" The set - up for this summer is disturbing , " says Mark Serreze , of the US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) .
A number of factors have this year led to most of the Arctic ice being thin and vulnerable as it enters its summer melting season .
In September 2007 , Arctic sea ice reached a record low , opening up the fabled North - West passage that runs from Greenland to Alaska .
The ice expanded again over the winter and in March 2008 covered a greater area than it had in March 2007 .
Although this was billed as good news in many media sources , the trend since 1978 is on the decline .
Young and Thin
Arctic ice at its maximum in March , but that maximum is declining by 44,000 km2 per year on average , the NSIDC has calculated ( see graph , top right ) .
That corresponds to an area roughly twice the size of New Jersey .
What is more , the extent of the ice is only half the picture .
Satellite images show that most of the Arctic ice at the moment is thin , young ice that has only been around since last autumn ( see picture , right ) .
Thin ice is far more vulnerable than thick ice that has piled up over several years .
Net Loss
" There is this thin first - year ice even at the North Pole at the moment , " says Serreze .
" This raises the spectre – the possibility that you could become ice free at the North Pole this year . "
Despite its news value in the media , the North Pole being ice free is not in itself significant .
To scientists , Serreze points out , " this is just another point on the globe " .
What is worrying , though , is the fact that multi- year ice – the stuff that does n't melt in the summer – is not piling up as fast as Arctic ice generally is melting .
On average each year about half of the first year ice , formed between September and March , melts during the following summer .
In 2007 , nearly all of it disappeared .
Moreover , an atmospheric phenomenon known as the Arctic oscillation kicked into its strong , " positive " , phase this winter .
This is known to generate winds which push multi- year ice out of the Arctic along the east coast of Greenland .
Ice Still Possible
Together , these are the factors that have led to most of the Arctic ice now being so young and thin .
" Even if you lost only half of the first - year ice this year – which would be average – you are still in for a very low ice extent this summer , " says Serreze .
Some factors could still save the day , though .
In summer 2007 , warm winds favoured melting .
" If we have an atmospheric pattern like we had last year , we are going to lose a whole bunch of ice this summer , but if we have a cooler , more cyclonic pattern , that might preserve some of that ice , " says Serreze .

There ’s No Shame in Renting
Sometimes renting makes more sense than buying .
There ’s been a lot of debate in the blogosphere lately about renting vs. buying a home .
Millionaire Mommy Next
Door touts renting as one of the ways she has amassed so much wealth .
Paidtwice was confused as to how renting could be a good deal for both the renter and the landlord .
Yesterday Paidtwice ran a guest post by Mike at Money Smarts Blog on real estate investing .
Catherine Schaffer of Wise Bread left the following comment ( in part ) :
… Your basic thesis is that landlords are stupid .
You can believe that if you want , but most landlords tend to believe the same thing of their tenants .
Now I ’m not sure that most landlords think their tenants are stupid ( after all , my landlord thinks I " m a genius for fixing a garbage disposal with baking soda and vinegar ) .
But there does seem to be a misconception out there that renters are just throwing their money away .
I ’m not saying buying a house is bad , but there are plenty of situations in which renting a home is a better idea then buying .
Good Reasons to Rent
1 . When you ca n’t afford to buy with a fixed rate mortgage and a 20 % down payment .
Buying a home is a good thing under the right circumstances .
However we ’re obviously seeing the fallout from mortgages being approved for people in the wrong circumstances .
If you buy a home with nothing down , take out an interest only or adjustable rate mortgage , you ’re taking a big risk .
If the housing market fluctuates slightly downward , you can easily end up upside - down in your house .
When the interest rates adjust upward , and you have no equity in your house , selling is n’t a great option , because you owe more than it ’s worth .
2 . When the difference between rental prices and home prices in your area is so great , that you can make more money investing the difference than waiting for your house to appreciate .
Traditionally , the stock market does better than home appreciation values .
If rents are much lower in your area than mortgages , you might be better off to rent and invest the difference .
3 . When you move around frequently .
It ’s difficult to recoup the costs associated with buying and selling a home if you move every few years , as is the case for military personnel .
If you are n’t going to live in your house very long , it ’s usually better to rent .
4 . When renting allows you to live in an area with better opportunities .
Right now we fall into this category .
We live in a great school district and a very safe small town .
We can walk to the local grocery store , library , parks , friend ’s houses …even to Walmart .
If we were to buy a house , we could only afford a house in one of the worst areas in a neighboring city .
We pay less than we would for a mortgage , our children are able to go to school in one of the best districts in the county , and we live in a safe neighborhood .
That would n’t be possible if we were to buy right now .
5 . When buying a home would stretch your budget beyond your comfort level .
Even if you have 20 % down and are able to qualify for a fixed rate mortgage , sometimes it may not be best to buy .
If your mortgage , property taxes , HOA payment , and estimated costs of repairs puts a serious strain on your budget , you have to evaluate whether it ’s worth it to buy a home at this time .
If you stretch your budget too much with your home costs , you may be sacrificing other financial goals , such as saving for retirement , saving for your children ’s college educations , or other financial goals you may have .
There ’s No Shame in Renting
We will be renting for the foreseeable future .
We do n’t have a down payment , the mortgage payment alone for homes in our area is twice what we pay for rent each month , and that ’s before taking into account other home related expenses .
We ’ve developed a good relationship with our landlord .
He lets us do what we want with the yard , and he ’s agreed to let me paint the interior of the house , too .
Because we rent , we do n’t have to spend a lot of time on little maintenance projects .
We do what we can , but for anything big , we call the landlord .
When the tree fell over in our yard a few years ago , it was nice to not have to figure out what to do with it .
And if something like this ever happened to us , the landlord would have to deal with it .
Not dealing with routine maintenance gives us the freedom to spend more time together as a family on weekends .
Will we ever buy a home ?
I do n’t know .
If we have a huge down payment and can get a good fixed rate mortgage that we will someday be able to pay off in full , I suppose it ’s possible .
For now , though , we ’re going to enjoy renting .
And who knows ?
We may rent forever .
Though there are definite benefits to owning a house , renting has it ’s own set of benefits .
Whether to rent or buy is a highly personal decision , based on your own priorities in life .
I think the " you ’re throwing your money away if you rent " argument is a little overrated .
Perhaps you ’re not gaining equity in your home , but you might be gaining more in investing income , more in your family time , and more in life energy , to borrow a term from Your Money or Your Life .
For the time being , I ’m going to buck the trend and be a proud renter .
Do you rent or own your home ?
If you rent , do you ever feel pressure to buy ?
If you own your home , was it the right choice for you ?

Researchers have developed a computer algorithm that can imitate the bat 's ability to classify plants using echolocation .
The study represents a collaboration between machine learning scientists and biologists studying bat orientation .
To detect plants , bats emit ultrasonic pulses and decipher the various echoes that return .
Bats use plants daily as food sources and landmarks for navigation between foraging sites .
Plant echoes are highly complex signals due to numerous reflections from leaves and branches .
Classifying plants or other intricate objects , therefore , has been considered a troublesome task for bats and the scientific community was far from understanding how they do it .
Now , a research group in Tübingen , Germany , including University of Tübingen researchers Yossi Yovel , Peter Stilz and Hans Ulrich - Schnitzler , and Matthias Franz from the Max Planck Institute of Biological Cybernetics , has demonstrated that this process of plant classification is not as difficult as previously thought .
The group used a sonar system to emit bat - like , frequency - modulated ultrasonic pulses .
The researchers recorded thousands of echoes from live plants of five species .
An algorithm that uses the time - frequency information of these echoes was able to classify plants with high accuracy .
This new algorithm also provides hints toward which echo characteristics might be best understood by the bats .
According to the group , these results enable us to improve our understanding of this fascinating ability of how bats classify plants , but do so without entering the bat 's brain .

The causes of the environmental crisis may be hugely complex , but the most effective way to deal with it in economic terms seems rather obvious .
We must use our best scientific understanding of how environmental problems can be resolved as the basis for implementing scientifically viable economic policies and solutions .
If this could be accomplished within the framework of the economic theory that we now use to coordinate economic activities in the global market system — neoclassical economics — there would be no cause for concern .
But as this discussion will demonstrate , there is a large problem here that should be cause for great concern : Neoclassical economic theory is predicated on unscientific assumptions that massively frustrate or effectively undermine efforts to implement scientifically viable economic policies and solutions .
These assumptions were first articulated by 18th - century moral philosophers ( Adam Smith , Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo ) who embraced a new understanding of God known as deism that resulted from attempts to understand the metaphysical implications of Newtonian physics .
Because this physics assumes that the laws of gravity completely determine the future state of physical systems , the deists concluded that the universe does not require , or even permit , active intervention by God after the first moment of creation .
They then imaged God as a clock maker and the universe as a clockwork regulated and maintained after its creation by physical laws . ( 1 )
Smith , Malthus and Ricardo believed that the clock maker created a second set of laws to govern the workings of the clockwork — the natural laws of economics .
Smith imaged the collective action of the forces associated with these laws as an " invisible hand , " and this construct became the central legitimating principle in mainstream economic theory .
Smith claimed that the invisible hand is analogous to the invisible force that causes a pendulum to oscillate around its center and move toward equilibrium or a liquid to flow between connecting chambers and find its own level .
Given that Smith 's invisible hand has no physical content and is an emblem for something postulated but completely unproved and unknown , why did he believe that it actually exists ?
The answer is that Smith was a deist and his belief in the existence of the invisible hand was an article of faith .
The Origins of Neoclassical Economic Theory
In economics textbooks , the 19th - century creators of the economic theory now used by mainstream economists ( Stanley Jevons , Leon Walras , Maria Edgeworth and Vilfredo Pareto ) are credited with transforming the study of economics into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline .
There are , however , no mentions in these textbooks , or in all but a few books on the history of economic thought , of a rather salient fact :
The progenitors of neoclassical economics , all of whom were trained as engineers , developed their theories by substituting economic variables derived from classical economics for physical variables in the equations of a soon - to - be outmoded mid–19th century theory in physics . ( 2 )
The physics that the economists used as the template for their theories was developed from the 1840s to the 1860s .
During this period , physicists responded to the inability of Newtonian mechanics to account for the phenomena of heat , light and electricity with a profusion of hypotheses about matter and forces .
In 1847 Hermann - Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz , one of the best known and most widely respected physicists at this time , posited the existence of a field of energy that could unify these phenomena .
This proposal served as a catalyst for a movement called " energetics " in which physicists attempted to explain very diverse physical phenomena in terms of a vaguely defined protean field of energy that fills all space .
The strategy used by the creators of neoclassical economics was as simple as it was absurd — the economists copied the physics equations and changed the names of the variables .
In the resulting mathematical formalism , utility becomes synonymous with the amorphous field of energy described in the equations taken from the physics , and the sum of utility and expenditure , like the sum of potential and kinetic energy in the physical equations , is conserved .
Forces associated with the field of utility ( or , in physics , energy ) allegedly determine prices , and spatial coordinates correspond with quantities of goods .
Because the physical system described in the equations of the theory in physics is closed , the economists were obliged to assume that the market system described in their theory is also closed .
And because the sum of energy in the equations that describe the physical system is conserved , the economists were also obliged to assume that the sum of utility in a market system is also conserved .
In the mathematical formalism that resulted from these substitutions , economic actors allegedly operate within a field of force identified , in both figurative and literal terms , with energy .
The natural laws of economics are assumed to operate within this field and to legislate over the decisions made by the economic actors .
Because utility–energy in this mathematical formalism is conserved , the creators of neoclassical economic theory concluded that production and consumption are physically neutral processes that do not alter the sum of utility .
And this conclusion became the basis for the claim that capital circulates in a closed loop from production and consumption and that the value of any good , commodity or service can only be determined by decisions made by economic actors .
The creators of neoclassical economic theory also failed to realize or chose to ignore the fact that market systems are not closed and the conservation principle is quite meaningless in any real economic process .
Nevertheless , these assumptions are now used to legitimate the existence of the invisible hand in its current form in the neoclassical economic paradigm — constrained maximization in general equilibrium theory .
Several well - known mid–19th century scientists told the economists that there was no basis for substituting economic variables for physical variables in the equations of the theory in physics .
But the economists did not appreciate how devastating this criticism was and proceeded to claim that they had transformed the study of economics into a scientific discipline comparable to physics .
In what is surely one of the strangest chapters in the history of Western thought , the origins of neoclassical economics were forgotten , the claim that neoclassical economic theory is scientific was almost universally accepted , and subsequent generations of economists disguised the existence of the unscientific axiomatic assumptions in this theory under an increasingly complex maze of mathematical formalism .
This misalliance between economic thought and a 19th - century physical theory explains why the neoclassical economic paradigm is predicated on the following unscientific assumptions :
Market systems exist in a domain of reality separate and distinct from other domains .
Capital circulates in these systems in a closed circular flow between production and consumption with no inlets or outlets .
The lawful dynamics of closed - market systems legislate over the behavior of economic actors , and the actors obey fixed decision - making rules .
The dynamics that operate within closed market systems , if they are not interfered with by the external or exogenous agencies such as government , will necessarily result in the growth and expansion of these systems .
Market forces will resolve environmental problems via price mechanisms , along with more efficient technologies and production processes .
The resources of nature are largely inexhaustible , and those that are not can be replaced by other resources or by technologies that minimize the use of the exhaustible resources or rely on other resources .
The environmental costs of economic activities can only be determined by pricing mechanisms that operate within closed market systems .
There are no biological or physical limits to the growth and expansion of market systems .
One does not have to a scientist to realize that these assumptions make no sense at all in scientific terms .
In these terms , markets are open systems that exist in embedded and interactive relationship with environmental systems .
Natural resources are clearly exhaustible , and our over - reliance on some of these resources , particularly fossil fuels , could soon result in irreversible large - scale changes in the global climate system .
The natural environment is not separate from economic processes , and wastes and pollutants from these processes are already at levels that threaten the stability and sustainability of virtually all environmental subsystems .
Last but not least , the limits to the growth of the global economy in biophysical terms are real and inescapable , and the assumption that market systems can perpetually expand and consume more scarce and nonrenewable natural resources is utterly false . ( 3 )
A Green Thumb on the Invisible Hand
When mainstream economists are confronted with the charge that there is no basis in neoclassical economic theory for realistically assessing the environmental costs of economic activities and internalizing these costs in pricing systems , they typically deny that this is the case by appealing to the work done by environmental economists .
This orthodox approach to resolving environmental problems is taught in universities and practiced in government agencies and development banks , and the solutions are almost invariably embedded in the mathematical formalism of general equilibrium theory .
When environmental economists calculate the environmental costs of economic activities , they assume that the relative price of each bundle of an environmental good , service , or amenity reveals the " real marginal values " of the consumer .
The creators of neoclassical economics conceived of the construct of marginal values after substituting utility for energy in the equations borrowed from the theory in physics .
In the resulting formalism , a marginal value essentially represents how much more a consumer is willing to pay to acquire incrementally larger amounts of a good , service or commodity .
Note what the writers of a textbook on environmental economics have to say about the dynamics of this process :
" The power of a perfectly functioning market rests in its decentralized process of decision making and exchange ; no omnipotent planner is needed to allocate resources .
Rather , prices ration resources to those that value them the most and , in doing so , individuals are swept along by Adam Smith 's invisible hand to achieve what is best for society as a collective .
Optimal private decisions based on mutually advantageous exchange lead to optimal social outcomes . " ( 4 )
In environmental economics , the presumption that optimal private decisions " based on mutually advantageous exchange " lead to optimal social outcomes for the state of the environment is a primary article of faith .
The environmental economists also assume that the mechanisms of the market system will resolve environmental problems when " prices are right . "
The right price in neoclassical economic theory is a function of the prices that economic actors have paid , or are willing to pay , to realize some marginal benefits of environmental goods and services .
Environmental economists often use cost - benefit analyses to place a value on environmental externalities , or environmental goods and services that are " external " to market systems in the sense that they are presumed to exist outside of the closed market system .
The problem that these accounting procedures are intended to resolve is that " real marginal values " can only be determined by dynamics that operate within closed market systems .
Given that the vast majority of the damage done to the natural environment by economic activities cannot be valued in these terms , environmental economists have developed indirect methods designed to estimate the " use - value " of these resources . ( 5 )
For example , contingent valuation methods are used to assess the economic value of recreation , scenic beauty , air quality , water quality , species preservation , bequests to future generations and other nonmarket environmental resources .
The methods are intended to assess the willingness - to - pay function of economic actors who would prefer to preserve natural environments ( preservation or existence values ) , maintain the option of using natural resources ( option values ) , and bequeath natural resources to future generations ( bequest values ) .
( 6 ) Most contingent valuation surveys seek to determine the maximal amount that individuals are willing to pay for an increase in the quality of an environmental resource and the minimal amount they are willing to accept as compensation to forgo this increase .
For the sake of argument , let us assume that contingent valuation studies are capable of revealing maximal social outcomes of environmental policy decisions .
Are we then to believe , as one such study showed , that reduction in chemical contaminants in drinking water was not important in economic terms because the value of a statistical life associated with a reduction in risk of death in 30 years was only $ 181,000 ?
( 7 ) Is $ 26 a measure of the real marginal costs of pollution because this is the average price that a household is willing to pay annually for a 10 percent improvement of visibility in eastern U.S. cities ?
( 8 ) Is the value of a whooping crane the $ 22 - per - year average that one set of households was willing to pay to preserve this species ( 9 ) and that of the bald eagle the $ 11 - per - year average that another set of households would spend to preserve this apparently less valuable species ? ( 10 )
Mainstream Economics and International Treaties
One reason why the international community has not been successful in forging agreements that could resolve the environmental crisis is that countries involved in the process of negotiating these agreements routinely invoke the legal principle of state sovereignty to protect their economic interests .
There is , however , another major reason why these agreements have not been effective .
The economic interests that the representatives of nation - states are seeking to protect are based on unscientific assumptions about the dynamics of market systems in neoclassical economic theory .
Another related problem is that these assumptions are embedded in the mathematical theories that serve as the basis for making cost - benefit analyses and the results of these analyses almost invariably indicate that the costs of implementing scientifically viable economic policies and solutions are greater than the benefits .
The unfortunate result is that the scientifically viable economic policies and solutions are typically nothing more than distant memories when the terms of a final agreement are approved .
This explains why the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( 1992 ) failed to protect the climate system , why the Convention on Biological Diversity ( 1992 ) did not even begun to reduce losses in biodiversity , and why the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification ( 1994 ) did not slow , much less reverse , this process .
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea ( 1982 ) and a host of other international agreements intended to reduce ocean pollution , prevent overfishing and protect endangered species failed to meet any of these objectives .
Nonbinding principles that would promote more sustainable management of forests were agreed to at the U.N. 's Earth Summit ( 1992 ) but negotiations broke down prior to the point where a general framework convention could be articulated .
A U.N. Convention on the Non-Navigable Uses of International Watercourses has been negotiated , but it has not gone into effect because some sovereign nation - states perceived this agreement as a threat to their economic interests . ( 11 )
Scientific evidence may play a supportive and enabling role in some negotiations , but only as a minimum condition for serious consideration of an environmental issue .
But what is not widely known is that these agreements made a mockery of the scientifically based solutions .
In the vast majority of negotiations on a great range of issues , such as commercial whaling , hazardous waste trade , loss of biodiversity , conditions in the Antarctic , and ocean dumping of radioactive waste , the scientific evidence was not given serious consideration .
When this evidence was perceived as a direct threat to the perceived economic interests of particular nation - states , it was either systematically ignored or explicitly rejected by the representatives of these states . ( 12 )
Recent Developments in Mainstream Economic Theory
A fair number of economists over the past two decades , including such luminaries as Kenneth J. Arrow , have expressed doubts about the efficacy of neoclassical economic theory .
However , the most direct challenges to axiomatic assumptions in this theory have been made by the game theorists .
For example , these theorists have challenged the assumption that economic actors are supremely rational , obey fixed decision - making rules and are incapable of making bad decisions .
In conventional neoclassical economic theory , the natural laws of economics allegedly determine the optimal outcome of an economic process and economic actors are devoid of all distinctly human characteristics .
This theory also assumes that the realm of the economy is stable and unchanging and that economic actors are supremely rational entities who do not talk back .
In opening the box of human subjectivity , the game theorists have been obliged to posit an increasing number of ad hoc variables to account for the decision - making of individual economic actors .
And this explains why the history of game theory is marked by a continual regression into the staggering complexities of language and culture .
As the economist R. Sugden puts it :
" There was a time , not long ago , when the foundations of rational - choice theory appeared firm , and when the job of the economic theorist seemed to be one of drawing out the often complex implications of a fairly simple and uncontroversial system of axioms .
But it is increasingly becoming clear that these foundations are less secure than we thought , and that they need to be examined and perhaps rebuilt .
Economic theorists may have to become as much philosophers as mathematicians . " ( 13 )
These criticisms and revisions of assumptions in neoclassical economic theory do not mean , however , that mainstream economists are in the process of developing a new theory predicated on a different set of assumptions .
Virtually all of the advanced theoretical work in this discipline is premised on the assumptions that market systems are closed , self - correcting and self - sustaining .
And the primary impulse in these theories is to disclose the hidden dynamics that move market systems toward optimal states of equilibria with the use of increasingly more sophisticated mathematical techniques .
The Two - Culture Problem
In my view the greatest obstacle to implementing scientifically viable economic solutions for global warming and other menacing environmental problems is not the claim that neoclassical economic theory is scientific .
It is the two - culture problem famously described by British physicist and novelist C. P Snow in 1959 .
Snow was concerned that the single intellectual culture that existed prior to World War II was splitting into two cultures with social scientists on one side of the divide and scientists on the other .
As it turned out , the two - culture problem was not resolved ; each culture 's members became increasingly isolated from the other 's , and the divide eventually became a yawning chasm .
The schism between the two cultures of mainstream economists and environmental scientists is painfully apparent in the institutional frameworks and processes we now use to develop and implement economic solutions for environmental problems .
The members of these cultures perform very different tasks and have virtually no contact with each other .
This problem is further complicated by the fact that the language used on one side of the divide is virtually incomprehensible to those on the other , and the cultural differences are large .
These differences range from alternate worldviews to disparate research methodologies and rules for gathering evidence .
The most expedient way to deal with this two - culture problem is also the most efficient way to begin the process of developing an environmentally responsible economic theory .
The solution is to create institutional frameworks and processes for developing scientifically viable economic policies and solutions for environmental problems that require mainstream economists and environmental scientists to work closely together during every stage of the process .
This idea is not as radical as it may first appear and there has already been some movement in this direction .
After Nicolas Stern , an internationally known development economist and former chief economist at the World Bank , was asked by the British government to prepare a report on the economics of climate change , he did something that no other mainstream economist with a similar reputation had ever done .
He crossed over the divide and took an extended course on the science of global warming from environmental scientists at the Hadley Center in London .
The 700 - page report that resulted from this collaboration contained the first realistic assessment of the costs of reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases to levels where the most disastrous consequences of global warming are unlikely to occur .
But in order to make this assessment , Stern and the other economists who worked on the report were obliged to use methodologies that violate foundational assumptions in neoclassical economic theory .
In a lecture that Stern gave to a group of economists a few months before the " Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change " was released on October 30 , 2006 , ( 14 ) he explained why it was necessary to violate these assumptions .
Stern began this lecture with a brief overview of the science of global warming with particular emphasis on the fact that the interactions between human and environmental systems are nonlinear and cannot be represented or described in the linear equations used by mainstream economists .
Stern then explained why global warming is not " a standard externality " problem and must be viewed as " international collective action problem . "
He also explained why the methodologies used by mainstream economists to evaluate the costs of economic activities are incapable of realistically assessing these costs .
During the course of this lecture , Stern repeatedly told his fellow economists that any viable economic solutions for the problem of global warming must be predicated on our best scientific understanding of how this problem can be resolved .
Equally remarkable , he also said that the resolution of this problem will require the very active involvement of governments and that the ethical dimensions of this problems extend well beyond the framework of any economic theory . ( 15 )
If we do manage to create the institutional frameworks and processes required to develop an environmentally responsible economic theory , many mainstream economists and environmental scientists may be reluctant to cross over the two - culture divide and work on this project .
But this resistance could be overcome if they realized that this is a once - in - all - human - lifetimes opportunity .
The opportunity is to protect the lives of the 6.6 billion members of the extended human family and the future existence of their descendents by resolving the crisis in the global environment .
If the opportunity to work on this project is understood in these terms , perhaps mainstream economists and environmental scientists will realize that there is no other work they could possibly do in their lifetimes that serves a greater good or answers to a higher calling .

The unconscious is playing a political role this year , for the evidence is overwhelming that most Americans have unconscious biases both against blacks and against women in executive roles .
At first glance , it may seem that Barack Obama would face a stronger impediment than Hillary Clinton .
Experiments have shown that the brain categorizes people by race in less than 100 milliseconds ( one - tenth of a second ) , about 50 milliseconds before determining sex .
And evolutionary psychologists believe we ’re hard - wired to be suspicious of people outside our own group , to save our ancestors from blithely greeting enemy tribes of cave men .
In contrast , there ’s no hard - wired hostility toward women , though men may have a hard - wired desire to control and impregnate them .
Yet racism may also be easier to override than sexism .
For example , one experiment found it easy for whites to admire African - American doctors ; they just mentally categorized them as “ doctors ” rather than as “ blacks . ”
Meanwhile , whites categorize black doctors whom they dislike as “ blacks . ”
In another experiment , researchers put blacks and whites in sports jerseys as if they belonged to two basketball teams .
People looking at the photos logged the players in their memories more by team than by race , recalling a player ’s jersey color but not necessarily his or her race .
But only very rarely did people forget whether a player was male or female .

“ We can make categorization by race go away , but we could never make gender categorization go away , ” said John Tooby , a scholar at the University of California , Santa Barbara , who ran the experiment .
Looking at the challenges that black and female candidates face in overcoming unconscious bias , he added , “ Based on the underlying psychology and anthropology , I think it ’s more difficult for a woman , though not impossible . ”

Wall Street likes a good bubble .
And Mr. Obama ?
He backs something called the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act , a measure that would limit all offshore accounts that the wealthiest hedge funds have set up .
That ’s not something Wall Street wants .
David Downs of the SF Weekly invited Electronic Frontier Foundation spokeshacker Peter Eckersly into his home to test claims that Comcast is blocking BitTorrent files :
Eckersley 's BitTorrent controller flickers for a second , showing that his computer is " seeding " our file to the Melbourne computer .
Then everything stops .
The transmission fails , and to an untrained eye , the problem appears to be with BitTorrent .
But Eckersley is running a Net monitor application called Wireshark , which works like an online customs officer checking the packets going out of the computer here and into the one in Melbourne .
What Eckersley finds is damning .
Someone or something has interceded in the transmission and told the computers to stop talking .
And that something , experts have concluded , is Comcast .
The experiment Eckersley and I ran replicates private and public versions that emerged last fall through an Associated Press story .
That story confirmed what many in software circles knew for most of 2007 : Comcast has been looking at its users '
Web traffic and secretly blocking some of the Internet , namely BitTorrent uploads , to users outside Comcast 's network .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation alleges that Comcast blocks BitTorrent with a classic hacker technique called " spoofing , " where the hacker poses as someone he is n't , in this case another user .
Eckersley describes it as if he and I were having a phone conversation , and then halfway through Comcast interrupts us and in my voice tells him to hang up , and in his voice tells me the same thing .
Freshly - anointed eBay CEO
John Donahoe , answering questions on the company 's earnings call last Thursday , dropped hints that it 's time for Skype to show some value or else go away .
The next step
2008 will be a year of " testing synergies " between the online voice and video communications service and other eBay operations such as auctions and PayPal payments .
Expanding on those comments to a Financial Times reporter , Donahoe explained that " If the synergies are strong , we 'll keep [ Skype ] in our portfolio .
If not , we 'll reassess it , " and possibly sell the unit .
That would be one way of reclaiming some of the capital — cash , intellectual , and street cred — that eBay has squandered on Skype so far .
The acquisition ostensibly cost $ 2.6 billion back in 2005 , but certain performance targets were not met , and the final tab ended up being $ 1.1 billion or thereabouts .
Skype founders Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström have moved on to video - streaming pastures in Joost .
There went the creative force behind Skype , and the service itself looks eerily similar to the circa -2005 version .
In other words , there 's not much going on here .
What went wrong ?
The original idea behind this ill - fated acquisition was that adding a leader in PC - based voice calls to online auctions would boost communication between curious buyers and nervous sellers , ultimately adding value to the company 's core operations .
More information begets more trust , which then leads to more completed transactions , goes the theory .
I suppose it could have worked , but that would have required an effort from the various management and engineering teams involved .
Heck , call up the marketing department , too .
Unfortunately , there never seemed to be a whole lot of that action going on .
eBay seems to have bought Skype and set it on auto - pilot ( destination : nowhere ) almost immediately .
Go to ebay.com today and look around , and you 'll find Skype getting equal billing to low - profile or low - profit luminaries like karmic micro-investment service MicroPlace and semi-social bookmarking application StumbleUpon .
Those are hardly revenue or profit drivers for eBay in any meaningful way .
Perhaps the Skype contact option would get more play if people actually knew about it , and if eBay spent any time promoting it while also considering Skype 's flaws .
Likewise , you could spend hours on Skype.com or the application itself and never know that eBay somehow stood behind it .
Yes , you can send PayPal payments to Skype contacts , which is swell , but that option hardly smacks you in the face when exploring either one of the corporate cousins ' sites and services .
The message should be clear : eBay 's leadership never saw fit to aggressively bring the two together .
Even a couple of quasi - discreet " call me now " and " send a few bucks " icons in strategic locations could make a world of difference , at very little engineering effort or cash cost .
And for the love of money , could eBay please put some domestic marketing muscle behind Skype ?
Here in the States , I would n't call Skype a household name outside the usual geek circles , while everyone knows about eBay .
In places like China and eastern Europe , the situation is reversed .
My Luddite old mom back in Sweden uses Skype for all her long - distance calls , for example .
eBay has squandered this opportunity in the US .
Who would buy this thing ?
If eBay is unwilling to push the integration points with Skype much harder ( I do n't think that it 's unable to do it ) , then it would make good sense to look for a buyer for this hunk of virtual deadwood .
The service comes with solid technology and 309 million users worldwide that made a combined 15.9 billion minutes ( 30,200 years ) worth of calls last year .
Facebook would clearly love a piece of that action , but could hardly afford it without a serious cash infusion from somewhere .
MySpace , with the financial heft of News Corp. , could buy it , but I 'm not sure that the management team there appreciates the potential power of such a hookup .
The social networking guys are focused on marketing right now .
Google has deep pockets and could link Skype into its Google Talk platform , which would be a serious upgrade to that user base .
Microsoft has the cash , the rival chat - and - talk network , and the acquisitive history to make a credible buyer , but is also way too occupied with the Yahoo deal to make a move today .
Yahoo itself could pick up Skype to build its corporate image a bit and thereby encourage a higher bid from a suitor like Microsoft , but should probably think bigger in that case and try a wholesale merger with eBay .
Barring any dark horses around the bend , then , Google sounds like a likely future Skype owner unless eBay CEO Donahoe does what Meg Whitman never did and turns the ugly duckling into a beautiful and valuable swan somehow .
But given what eBay has n't accomplished in the last couple of years , we wo n't be surprised to find Skype publicly on the block ( privately , it already is in many ways ) .
In closing , recall that Google is well suited to run a VoIP company like Skype .
Their current Android cellphone platform , coupled with their acquisition of GrandCentral , sets them up to make bold and interesting moves .
But they can likely make those moves without Skype , and may be unwilling to pay much for it as a result .
There 's no doubt , however , that Google could fix many of Skype 's woes

TEHRAN  Iran announced on Tuesday a significant expansion of its plans to enrich uranium despite the United Nations Security Council ’s demand that it halt the program .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during a visit to Iran ’s main enrichment complex at Natanz that the country had started installing 6,000 centrifuges at the site , in addition to the existing 3,000 centrifuges .
Western experts cautioned that Iran ’s technical claims often exceeded its grasp , and in the past they have greeted such pronouncements by Iran with skepticism .
While they have confirmed that Iran has 3,000 operating centrifuges , there was no confirmation of the latest claims .
If Iran carries out its plans , it will triple the size of its industrial base and produce a major expansion in its uranium enrichment program .
Enrichment can make fuel for civilian nuclear reactors or , if taken to higher levels , nuclear warheads .
The United States and other Western countries have accused Iran of having a clandestine nuclear arms program , but Iran says its program is peaceful and for civilian purposes only .
Excitement was in the air .
It was the turn of the century and the dot - com boom was in full effect .
The bubble just kept growing and growing , and it was probably invincible !
The consulting company that Chris G. worked for had gotten their largest contract yet — the first they 'd ever had in the seven figure range .
Their goal ?
Build a sister site for a major investment bank that would serve news and analysis on the latest in the investment world .
Going in , the client made it clear that they wanted to do things right and that money was not an object .
This was the height of the bubble , after all .
In addition to Chris 's company , top consultants from IBM and Sun were hired and involved in virtually every aspect of the project .
After the majority of the analysis was done , it was time to discuss the bank 's hardware needs .
Sun 's analysis , in short , was that they had to go big — no namby pamby rackmounted servers , no weakass four - processor units .
No , they needed the behemoth — the E10K .
The E10K was big in every sense of the word ; a minimum of four processors ( with a cap of 64 ) , housed in a hulking 5.8 ' x3 ' x4 ' case , with a weight of 1,800 pounds .
Because of the large user loads they were anticipating , they had to go full throttle — all sixty four processors .
This was probably more power than they needed , but at least they would n't have to worry about upgrades for a while .
Once the site opened , though , it would blow up and the number of users would surge to the levels that would require this kind of power .
But that was n't all .
The system defined three classes of users — registered , unregistered , and staff .
Sun recommended one E10K for each user class .
Each E10K with the proposed configuration cost around $ 2,000,000 .
So thus far , they were looking at six million dollars .
Oh , right , they need a BCP environment , so double it .
Six servers , twelve million dollars , over five tons of hardware .
Of course , the environments for dev and QA should perform similarly to production , so toss on another six E10Ks each .
If you 've been following along , you 'll see that it 's up to 18 servers .
Thirty six million dollars worth of hardware .
When Sun presented the total for the servers , some additional hardware and fees brought it up to an even $ 40,000,000 .
The price tag was n't that hard for the bank to swallow , however .
It had been running an aggressive marketing campaign to drum up interest in the new site and they were sure that buzz was building .
Existing customers had the exciting opportunity to pre-register for the site so they could have all of the benefits on day one .
After the multi-million dollar campaign , it was time to tally up the pre-registrations .
One - hundred and six people .
It was n't the end of the world , though - it could still work if they somehow managed to squeeze hundreds of thousands of dollars from each registered user .
OK , maybe it was the end of the world .
Realizing that there was no way they 'd ever be able to recoup the money spent on hardware , software , consulting , and ongoing maintenance of this system , management canceled the entire project , sending nearly a floor of developers to the curb and putting Chris 's company in ruin .

To anyone who studies the Unidentified Flying Object ( UFO ) phenomenon , the name Dr. J. Allen Hynek is well known .
An astrophysicist who worked with Ohio State University , Harvard University , and later Northwestern University , Dr. Hynek was best known for his work as a consultant for the United States military during their study of UFOs .
~
Ultimately known as Project Blue Book , the U.S. Air Force began an official investigation into the aerial unknowns in 1947 .
Their investigation lasted about 22 years , wherein they enlisted the help of Dr. Hynek as a consultant during their study .
~
He began as a skeptic , and would find explanations for the thousands of cases the Air Force scrutinized ( and later concluded were all explainable ) .
But his beliefs would not last long .
Possibly due to the evidence he saw , the bureaucratic red tape , or maybe because of a personal experience , Dr. Hynek changed his stance on UFOs , and would devote his life to exploring the phenomenon .
~
He went on to create the Center for UFO Studies ( CUFOS ) , which still exists today .
In November of 1978 , Dr. Hynek presented a statement to the United Nations General Assembly in hopes to bring worldwide attention to the topic .
~
Around the same time , Dr. Hynek continued his consulting work – but not with the U.S. military .
Rather , with Steven Spielberg on Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
~
Dr. Hynek ’s life , work and dedication to the topic motivated a small , but influential group of scientists to take the topic seriously .
~
Dr. Hynek ’s life was dedicated not only to the study of UFOs , but to the study of science , and the advancement of what we know about our universe .
Much of his career highlights are about his UFO study , but Dr. Hynek also played a massive role in understanding the cosmos .
~
As stated in recently declassified papers , Dr. Hynek worked under several contracts with the U.S. military , and authored numerous papers on the study of the universe , the cosmos , and understanding the need for studying it .
~
The Black Vault website has released a batch of ten research papers , eight of which are part of Dr. Hynek ’s “ Fluctuations of Starlight and Skylight ” study .
Never before released publicly , the documents offer a rare glimpse into the work and studies of Dr. Hynek .
~
The following documents have been released , and are available for download

Just suppose for a while an important event is just a few days away and you have not ordered branded pens , a new corporate brochure , and order more letterheads .
What do you do ?
An event can not be held without manpower whether you do it with your colleagues or friends .
Others are also supposed to take the strain , for sure .
This is because you cannot take it all on yourself .
As a matter of fact , something that is not your area of experience can be a complete panic .
Asking for help on part of organizations is no wonder whenever it comes to dealing with a fleet of printers including maintenance and installations , making you face the laborious task that may make you feel overwhelmed .
The way effective print management can work wonders for you !
No matter what size a corporation is , print management is designed to help them out .
There are different ways to manage the print process of your company since you may need to print in bulk .
In a lot of offices , businesses , organizations , corporations , and institutes , the use of print management service is quite common .
With the help of effective print management , you will be able to increase security , modernize an enterprise and reduce significant costs .
Effective print management can come with a lot of benefits such as a reduction in costs , security enhancement and innovative enterprise .
There is no doubt that it is hard to maintain and install a fleet of printers , and this is why organizations want to seek help .
On some special events , you have to do a lot of things , and therefore , you need use to professional service .
This is because you need to order branded pens , buy a new corporate brochure , and order more letterheads and so on .
Thanks for reading this brief piece of writing .
Clinton calls for Olympic opening boycott
The first high - profile move of the post - Penn campaign :
Clinton is calling on Bush to boycott the Olympics opening ceremony .
An aide confirms the news , reported first -- EXCLUSIVE -- by Drudge .
Leaders led by German chancellor Angela Merkel have made plans to boycott the opening ceremony to press China for its crackdown in Tibet .
A coalition of groups trying to end the Sudanese government 's attacks on civilians in Darfur also called Friday on world leaders to boycott the opening ceremony to protest China 's support for Sudan 's government .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also suggested boycotting the August 8 opening ceremony .
" How can world leaders watch the lighting of the Olympic torch – under the “ one world , one dream ” banner – without taking bolder action to extinguish the flames of violence still consuming the defenseless men , women and children of Darfur ? " the groups said in a statement .
UPDATE : Clinton released a statement Monday afternoon calling for the confrontational step , a high - profile move that could also serve to distract from her campaign 's internal woes :
The violent clashes in Tibet and the failure of the Chinese government to use its full leverage with Sudan to stop the genocide in Darfur are opportunities for Presidential leadership .
These events underscore why I believe the Bush administration has been wrong to downplay human rights in its policy towards China .
At this time , and in light of recent events , I believe President Bush should not plan on attending the opening ceremonies in Beijing , absent major changes by the Chinese government .
I encourage the Chinese to take advantage of this moment as an opportunity to live up to universal human aspirations of respect for human rights and unity , ideals that the Olympic games have come to represent .
Americans will stand strong in support of freedom of religious and political expression and human rights .
Americans will also stand strong and root for the success of American athletes who have worked hard and earned the right to compete in the Olympic Games of 2008 .
If three kid inventors have anything to say about it , all vegetables will taste like chocolate ... even brussel sprouts !
Yep !
Three third - graders from Annapolis , MD have invented " The Micro Flavor Machine , " and won a shot at the finals of the 2008 Toshiba / National Science Teachers Association ExploraVision Awards .
The challenge to grade - school and high - school students throughout the U.S. and Canada was to design a technology that could exist in year 2028 based on current technologies and scientific principles .
Toshiba has held the ExploraVision contest for 16 years .
The Flavor Machine team was one of 4,527 teams making it to the semi-finals , where 68 judges will be deciding their fate !
The 8 and 9 - year olds on the Micro Flavor Machine team , Ashley Rambo , Samantha Cooke , and Katie White decided to find a way to get kids to want to eat what is healthy for them .
Ashley described the invention to The Capitol newspaper of Annapolis , Md .
" Katie made a little prototype machine with two magnetrons .
The food still looks the same , but the flavor changes .
The magnetrons change the food 's flavor into a gas , another flavored gas replaces it .
If we used a liquid , it would turn food into mush . "
How does a 9 - year old create two magnetrons ?
Beyond me .
But whether this team wins the ExploraVision Contest or not , I hope they did n't sign their rights away ....
The Micro Flavor Machine is an idea that has legs and wings !
And not just for kids .
The Toshiba / National Science Teacher ExploraVision Awards will be announced at the beginning of May .
Good luck to the Annapolis " dream team " and all the other kid inventor teams that are participating in the semi-finals of this event .

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has moved to set up a system that would send text alerts to people on their mobile phones in case of natural disasters and other emergencies .
With an order released Wednesday , the FCC adopted technical requirements for transmission of the alerts , which would require the cooperation of mobile operators .
However , at least one large hurdle remains before the system is launched :
No government agency has yet been named to collect and transmit the alerts to mobile operators .
The Commercial Mobile Alert System ( CMAS ) would be designed to reach U.S. residents regardless whether they have access to a TV , radio or electricity .
More than 250 million people in the country have mobile phones today , FCC commissioners noted .
The system would send out three types of alerts : Imminent Threat Alerts , with information on emergencies that may pose an imminent threat to peoples ' lives or well - being , Child Abduction Emergency / AMBER Alerts concerning missing children and Presidential Alerts , which would preempt any other pending alerts .
The alerts initially would be text only , though with vibration and audio signals for people with disabilities .
They eventually might include audio and video content .
Any subscriber to a mobile service with roaming agreements could get the alerts wherever they were , as long as their handset supports the system , according to an FCC statement .
" We are enabling wireless providers that choose to participate in this system to begin designing their networks to deliver wireless alerts , " FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said in a prepared statement .
" It would have been better , of course , if we had a Federal entity in place now to take on the role of alert aggregator and gateway . "
Martin said he hopes Wednesday 's order starts a dialog that helps get an agency assigned to this role quickly .
Participating carriers will be required to comply with the rules adopted in the order within 10 months after it's announced that an agency has been chosen to handle the system , the FCC said in a news release .
The FCC adopted the order in compliance with the Warning , Alert and Response Network ( WARN ) Act , which Congress passed in 2006 .
Its standards are based on the recommendations of the Commercial Mobile Service Alert Advisory Committee .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) was intimately involved in developing the idea of a single agency to collect and send alerts to carriers , but then objected to playing that role , Commissioner Michael Copps said in a written statement .
FEMA said it would be unable to step in for statutory and other reasons , Copps said .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- On Sept. 20 , the Canadian dollar , known as the " loonie " for the fowl that adorns it , became equal in value to the American dollar .
It was a moment of pride for our polite brethren to the north - the last time the loonie hit parity was 1976 but more important , it meant a 30 % discount for anything bought in U.S. dollars compared with four years ago .
In recent weeks , the U.S. has been looking like Canada 's answer to Mexico : Citizens from the Great White North have been traveling south to gobble up everything from steak dinners to multibillion - dollar banks on the cheap .
The most voracious shopper so far has been Ed Clark , CEO of Canada 's Toronto - Dominion Bank ( Charts ) .
Days after the currencies hit par , his company said it would pick up New Jersey - based Commerce Bancorp ( Charts ) for $ 8.5 billion .
That must have seemed like a fire - sale price : Clark began talks in June , when the loonie was worth 90 cents to our dollar ; by the time he unveiled the deal , the price had dropped by $ 1 billion Canadian .
" All the planets perfectly aligned to bring this deal to fruition , " a giddy Clark told investors in a conference call .
More deals may be coming soon - especially from Canadian banks , which since 1998 have been forbidden by the government from merging with each other .
What choice does the CEO of an acquisitive financial services company have but to buy in America ?
" [ Parity ] has probably put more potential deals on the plate than were there a year ago , " says Douglas Porter , deputy chief economist for BMO Capital Markets .
" The currency has just had an astonishing run-up . "
And to think it was only yesterday that Canadian firms were bemoaning a rise in foreign takeovers on their side of the border ( see " Is Canada for Sale ? " ) .
Border towns across the country , meanwhile , report an uptick in free - spending Canadians .
Philip Pantano , spokesman for the Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel in Niagara Falls , says the resort has seen a 200 % increase in Canadian traffic in recent months .
In Bellis Fair mall in northern Washington State , Canadians are descending in force .
" I 've walked the parking lot , and it seemed like 75 % of the cars had Canadian license plates , " says Bethany Lyons , assistant store manager at the center 's Target .
All that shopping can make a Canadian hungry .
Frank Passalacqua , owner of Carl 's Chop House in Detroit , says the mood among his Canadian customers is ebullient .
" They 're ordering bigger sizes and things they did n't order before , " he says .
One customer marveled that he could get two porterhouses instead of one - and did .
Already big corporations are tapping this new market .
Days after the currencies became equal , Disney ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) ran ads in Canadian papers trumpeting " Parity ... a dream come true " to lure Canadians to its theme parks .
In fact , Florida tourism officials say they expect a banner winter thanks to Canadian snowbirds .
They probably wo n't be disappointed .
" Every Canadian
I meet on the golf course who goes to Florida has a smile on his face from one end to the other , " says Joe Revell , a retiree from Prince Edward Island who winters in Daytona Beach Shores .
" It 's like they all just got a 20 % to 30 % discount . "
So much for the almighty American dollar .
But there may be one place to take solace : The San Jose Sharks look like Stanley Cup contenders this season .
Canadians may have the loonie , but would n't they rather have a championship hockey team ?

Hackers of the world will once again unite at DEFCON 16 , this August 8th , one of the industry 's top conferences .
The world 's best and brightest security minds will deliver presentations and papers , sharing their latest research during the three day event .
As usual , DEFCON is home to a number of classic hacker contests , including the Phreaking Challenge , Capture the Flag , Mystery Challenge , Hacker Jeopardy and the once great , Spot the Fed contest .
A few new events debuting this year include , BuzzWord Survivor , Hardware Hacking Village and the unnecessarily controversial Race - to - Zero contest .
Due to the lack of technical comprehension , the Race - to - Zero event has received a substantial amount of controversial publicity .
However , media and vendor misperception is relatively common when it comes to any hacker - cons .
This is sometimes due to their never having actually attended one .
Therefore , I felt it was important to report , as a hacker and journalist , some facts .
Contrary to popular belief , this is not a seminar aimed at teaching malicious code writing .
Furthermore , it is not a meeting for malware authors , to share methodologies of evading AV detection .
Demonstrating the human nature of " fearing what is not understood " , individuals from several AV companies have advocated their cowardice :
Sophos senior technology consultant Graham Cluley said , " The last thing the world needs is more malware .
It 's really disappointing to see that Defcon appears to be condoning the creation of malware in this way .
McAfee Avert Labs ' security research and communications manager Dave Marcus claimed , " Encouraging research that results in better evasion techniques for malware writers is not a good idea .
How many identities will be lost and how much data will be stolen from users as a result of the new techniques and evasions that are created ?
Security research should center around bettering detection not evasion . "
TrendMicro researcher Paul Ferguson said , " It will do more harm than good .
Responsible disclosure is one thing , but now actually encouraging people to do this as a contest is a little over the top . "
AVG Technologies ' chief research officer Roger Thompson stated , " It 's hard to see an upside for encouraging people to write more viruses .
It 's a dumb idea . "
New viruses will not be created and no modified or variant code will be publicly released .
The rules of the contest are well explained on their website .
Participants are provided with samples of viral code , which they modify in attempt to evade multiple AV engines .
Advancement to subsequent rounds is achieved when the code 's rate of detection is zero , hence the name , Race - to - Zero .
While the original sample code provided may be modified , it may not be functionally changed .
Furthermore , the code must exploit the original vulnerability , despite modification .
In addition to fostering the education of reverse engineering , this event will help raise awareness to the inefficiencies of signature - based detection , and reveal the true ( in ) effectiveness of current AV products .
When AV companies release new updated products , they may have to do more than just improve the user interface , change the name slightly ( 2008 edition ! ) and tweak their marketing strategy .
Then again I 've never coded AV detection software before .... only malware .

The reporters got as much time as they wanted and were permitted to take notes , but the returns could not leave the room .
Asked about such restrictions , Mr. McLagan said other politicians , like Gov. George E. Pataki , had used the same system .
Many , including President and Mrs. Clinton , distribute copies .
The Lazio campaign did not provide originals of the returns , and they did not include the dates they were filed .
Aides said Mr. Lazio has always filed on time and had never sought extensions or filed amended returns .
He used an accountant , except in 1990 , when it appears he did his return himself .
Mrs. Lazio has proudly declared that she cleans her own house , and there was nothing in the returns to disprove that .
The Lazios did not pay any taxes on salaries for household help or day care , and Mr. McLagan said they had never used hired help to care for their two young daughters .
Other politicians in recent years have run into trouble for not paying taxes on wages to domestic workers .
As had already been apparent from the disclosure forms that he files with Congress , the returns show that Mr. Lazio was smitten with the stock market in recent years , often engaging in short - term stock trades , though his lackluster results suggest he might have been better off putting his money in a mutual fund that tracked the market .
One of his worst trades was in the stock of Halliburton , the oil services company whose chief executive then was Dick Cheney , now the Republican vice presidential nominee .
Mr. Lazio lost about $ 5,000 trading Halliburton stock in 1998 , when the stock was sagging along with oil prices .
The returns confirm the details provided earlier by the campaign about one of Mr. Lazio 's biggest successes in the market , his 1997 windfall from speculating in the stock of Quick & Reilly , a brokerage firm .
Those investments were the subject of an insider trading inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission that ended last week with the agency taking no action .
In 1999 , the Clintons reported income of $ 416,039 .
The Lazios ' adjusted gross income has hovered around $ 150,000 in recent years , largely because of his Congressional salary .
Their best year was 1997 , when they declared $ 159,258 in adjusted gross income .
John Tucker Must MySpace
John Tucker Must Die is a new film from 20th Century
Fox about four girls who try to get revenge on womanizing high school stud John Tucker .
The film has exceeded expectations at the box office .
It almost beatfor the number two slot Friday night .
One reason for the film 's strong performance could be the film 's marketing campaign which made used of the MySpace URL : www.myspace.com/JohnTucker.
The MySpace URL was promoted on television advertisements and movie previews .
The MySpace site includes information the film , downloads , photographs and buddy icons .
It also includes a basketball schedule that shows John Tucker as the leading scorer in each game .
The MySpace site has quickly acquired over 100,000 MySpace friends and the individual profiles for the vengeful girls ( Heather , Carrie , Beth and Kate ) in the film have also garnered thousands of MySpace friends .
It is an interesting way to promote a movie that probably works best for films like this one that target the younger demographic that loves to use social networks .
The film is a Fox product and MySpace is owned by Fox so it would have been a huge mistake for Fox not to have promoted this movie on MySpace .

Doing his best Rick Santorum impression , Cliff May revealed Friday on " Verdict " the super - secret document proving that McCain ( and his babysitter , Joe Lieberman ) were wrong to correct their " misstatement " that Iran has nothing to do with training al Qaeda .

Abrams makes the rather obvious point that whether or not May 's documents prove a connection , McCain and Lieberman both corrected themselves anyway .
May 's excuse for this ?
" He probably did n't want to explain the extent of evidence that we have of al Qaeda 's connection to Iran . "
Riiiight .
Here 's a little reminder , Cliff :
When even warmongers like McCain and Lieberman distance themselves from highly dubious saber - rattling claims , chances are you should too .
Kudos to Abrams for admitting what has been painfully obvious for some time now ; that the press repeatedly gives McCain a free pass , particularly when it comes to evidence that undercuts his supposed expertise in national security .

Stevey 's Drunken Blog Rants ™
Have you ever noticed that writing is as hard as programming ?
Welcome to my 10th attempt at writing this month 's Stevey on Languages column !
At least the 10th .
I 've got dead articles galore .
Part of the problem is that I subscribe to the Miami Herald online articles , specifically the Dave Barry ones .
If you ever want to get into writing , do n't read Dave Barry .
You 'll write an article that you think is perfectly good , maybe even a little bit funny , and then Dave 's column will come out , and you 'll be compelled to print out a copy of your now - dead article , just so you can burn it and eat the ashes .
This month , I wanted to give a Whirlwind Tour of all the languages we use at Amazon , saying something funny and yet still insightful and relevant about each of them .
Unfortunately , given that we use something like 30 languages here , all I had room for was one - liners , like : " C++ : an octopus made by nailing extra legs to a dog .
( Steve Taylor ) . "
And : " When C++ is your hammer , everything starts to look like your thumb .
( Amazon interview candidate ) " .
Insightful perhaps , and relevant , but not the makings of a good article .
I also wanted to talk about static vs. dynamic typing , and pattern matching syntax , and a bunch of other techie stuff .
Yeah , yeah , be still your beating heart , I know .
But something kept nagging me , something I could n't quite put my finger on , but it might have been remotely related to the fact that every time Mike C. sees me , he says : " Hey there , OCaml boy ! "
I just can't put my finger on it , but something 's definitely nagging me lately .
So my articles kept meandering into self - defense territory , and it finally dawned on me : my problem is Mike !
( Har , har . )
No , actually my problem is that I 've been writing all these late - night blog entries , usually after too many , er , beverages , and now everyone thinks I believe the company should switch to OCaml .
Ouch .
So I 'm gonna write about languages , and popularity .
In particular , I think your choice of language should be based on cost optimization .
Next month we can talk about techie stuff .
Promise .
OCaml Considered Unpopular
Let 's get this out of the way right up front .
Here 's a fictitious dialogue between an utterly fictitious person who is not intended to bear any resemblance to real persons , and myself : Let 's get this out of the way right up front .
Here 's a fictitious dialogue between an utterly fictitious person who is not intended to bear any resemblance to real persons , and myself : Mike : Should Amazon switch to OCaml , or use it in any capacity ?
Me : Um ... no .
Mike :
What about all your blog - ranting about its time - machine debugger and all that stuff ?
Me : ( hopeful )
If I told you to jump off a bridge , would you do it ?
Mike : Um ... no .
But you did say it was the coolest language since ( and I distinctly remember this ) " Cobol " .
Me : Um , that might have been " Algol " .
But I did say OCaml was cool , yes .
Mike :
Well then !
If it 's so cool , why should n't we use it here ?
Me : ' cuz it ai n't popular .
But why did I write those blogs about OCaml ?
Well , it 's got some nice features , sure .
And its runtime performance is amazing .
But OCaml has strengths and weaknesses , as do all languages .
If I were writing a native Windows / Win32 application , one that I had to compile into an executable to run on client desktops , then I 'd seriously consider using OCaml .
But I 'm not doing that , and ( presumably ) neither are you .
OCaml 's primary use to you and me is as a learning tool .
High - level languages generally offer direct support for high - level abstractions , which just means you can express something complex without using very much code .
It can be a challenge to figure out what the heck some fancy new abstraction is actually doing , and why you 'd ever need it .
But once it sinks in , you 'll start seeing places in your own code where you 're doing ... well , something like that abstraction .
Except your version is all watered - down and mixed in with the rest of your code .
It 's there , but it 's not as clear .
The same thing happened when Design Patterns came out , did n't it ?
That book just gave names to things you were probably doing already , except maybe you had n't always encapsulated the idea as well as they did in the book .
The book elevated certain useful programming idioms to the status of first - class citizenship .
New programming languages do exactly the same thing , except they usually offer syntactic support for these idioms , so it might look a little " weird " at first .
That 's the thing about syntax - it obscures the idea initially , because you have no clue as to what all the squiggly symbols mean , but after you learn them , it can make the code easier to read and write .
OK , I think we need one techie detour before we move on .
OCaml , SML and Haskell are all research -y pinhead type languages , but they 're generally well - regarded .
At least by pinheads .
They all offer support for pattern - matching on data structures .
OK ... what 's that ?
To illustrate , let 's consider the following snippet of Java code : public void processPeople ( List < Person > people ) { if ( people = = null | | people .
is Empty ( ) ) {
System .
out .
println ( " Sorry bub : empty list . " ) ; return ; } int length = people .
length ( ) ; if ( length = = 1 ) {
handleOnePerson ( people .
get ( 0 ) ) ; } else if ( length = = 2 ) {
handleTwoPeople ( people .
get ( 0 ) , people .
get ( 1 ) ) ; } else {
System .
out .
println ( " Woah !
We got " + length + " people ! " ) ; } } ( Sorry about the code being lit up like a bad Christmas tree .
My syntax - highlighting program is a bit over - zealous . )
This is n't the greatest code in the world , but it gets the point across .
Basically we receive a list of Person objects , and we need to do one of four things , depending on whether the list has 0 , 1 , 2 , or more than 2 elements in it .
It 's a pretty common thing to want to do : we 're examining a data structure and dispatching based on its contents .
OK , let 's look at the same thing in Perl , which is usually less verbose than Java : sub processPeople { my @people = @_ ; my $ len = scalar @people ; if ( $ len = = 0 ) { print " Sorry bub : empty list .
" ; } elsif ( $ len = = 1 ) { handleOnePerson ( @people [ 0 ] ) ; } elsif ( $ len = = 2 ) { handleTwoPeople ( @people [ 0 ] , @people [ 1 ] ) ; } else { print " Woah !
We got $ len people !
" ; } } Nope , no help there .
Looks basically the same .
We 're still getting the length of the list and testing it for 4 cases .
There are a few differences , of course .
For one , Perl appears to be great at interpolating variables into strings , but its built - in length ( ) function does n't work for lists .
So it goes .
Note :
Please do n't email me saying that you would n't have coded it this way .
I would n't have either .
I 'm keeping these examples simple and non-idiomatic to make them as readable as possible .
Let 's try Ruby , which is a lot like Perl , but cleaner , more modern , and usually less verbose : def processPeople people if people .
nil ? | | people .
empty ?
puts
" Sorry bub : empty list . " return end len = people .
length
if len = = 1 handleOnePerson people [ 0 ] elsif len = = 2 handleTwoPeople people [ 0 ] , people [ 1 ] else puts " Woah !
We got #{len} people ! " end end Nope !
Even good ol ' Ruby , a lovely Perl substitute if there ever was one , looks about the same in this example .
Cleaner , maybe .
But if Ruby 's better than Perl , it 's clearly not from doing this kind of thing .
Incidentally , I avoided using case - or switch - statements in all three snippets above , because in general , you can't use them for this kind of problem .
We got lucky in this example because we 're dispatching based on the length of the list , which is constant .
But we could have been dispatching based on the structure and / or contents of the list , requiring us to dive into it and grub around .
So in the general case , you 'll use a cascading if - then - else .
Anyway , the Haskell / SML / OCaml designers realized that you do this kind of thing so often in your code that they made a special syntax for it .
In OCaml ( the most verbose of the three ) it looks like this : let processPeople people =
match people with [ ] -> print_endline " Sorry bub : empty list . " | [ p1 ] -> handleOnePerson p1 | [ p1 ; p2 ] -> handleTwoPeople p1 p2 | _ -> print_endline " Woah !
We got " ^ ( length people ) ^ " people ! "
HMMMmmmm ... this looks different .
What 's happening here ?
It looks a bit like a case or switch statement , but ... not .
What 's going on is just pattern - matching , a bit like you do on strings with regular expressions .
You 're drawing little ascii pictures of what you 're looking for in each case , and inside the pictures , you 're creating variable names to hold the pieces if there 's a match .
Each " case " in the pattern matcher consists of a pattern , a little arrow - sign ( " - > " ) , and some code to run if that case matched .
The code does n't have to be on one line ; it just worked out that way in this example .
The cases are separated by " or " ( " | " ) symbols .
Patterns can be almost arbitrarily complex , and dive way deep into the data structure , even though they 're simple in this example .
Our first case is an empty list : [ ] .
The next case tries to match a list with one item ; if there 's a match , it names it p1 and passes it to the code on the right .
Similarly with the next case , but with 2 items .
The last case uses a wildcard ( " _ " ) to say " match anything else . "
Pretty nifty , eh ?
To be fair , it 's not such a huge win in this example .
But as your data structures and class structures get more complex , and more deeply nested , this pattern - matching facility becomes reeeeally convenient .
Also , the pattern - matching syntax can be used in all sorts of places , not just in a match - statement .
For instance , if you look at the three OCaml solutions ( or the surprisingly compact Haskell solution ) to the July Amazon Developers Journal " Farmer puzzle " challenge , you 'll see pattern matching all over the place .
In the Haskell one , the function for checking if a state is " bad " ( i.e. someone gets eaten ) uses pattern matching on the argument to the function : -- check bad state : chicken alone with dog or bag bad [ [ _ , fs ] , [_ , ds ] , [_ , cs ] , [_ , gs ] ] = ( cs /= fs ) && ( cs == ds || cs == gs )
Here , the bad function gets a list as its argument .
But instead of naming the list , it specifies a pattern that it expects the list to match : a list of 2 - item sublists .
It ignores the first element of each sublist , and assigns the second element to fs ( farmer side ) , ds ( dog side ) , etc .
The variables then become available for use in the body of the function , after the " = " sign , where we check if if the chicken 's alone with the dog or the grain .
Generally , pattern matching allows you to specify something that looks like a literal declaration , but instead of building the data structure , it matches it against an existing one .
You just can't do that in most languages , but looking at the farmer - puzzle solutions , it 's clear than when you can do it , you use it all the time .
Meanwhile , back on Planet Earth ...
OK , so how does this help us with our day - to - day C++ / Java / Perl coding ?
After all , we 're not about to use OCaml or Haskell for anything at Amazon ; they 're not popular enough , so we'd have a heck of a time hiring people , finding documentation , integrating with other languages and 3rd - party systems , etc .
So what good is knowing about this feature ?
Well , I 'd argue that you 've just learned yourself a new Design Pattern -- one that 's usually just called pattern matching , but it 's a Design Pattern nonetheless .
And now , whenever you start learning a new language , you 'll probably wonder whether they have support for this feature , and if so , how .
Some other languages do have it - for instance , Lisp has a function called destructuring - bind that does pretty much the same thing .
And a new JVM scripting language called Groovy is offering something kinda similar called a " path expression " .
If you already know about pattern - matching syntax , picking up path expression minilanguages like Groovy 's GPath becomes quite a bit easier .
For some abstractions -- maybe not this one , but for some -- you can find ways to encapsulate them as new classes or library routines in your favorite language .
That 's actually what the Design Patterns book was all about : expressing idioms in C++ that are often natively supported in other languages .
Perl 's Switch.pm is a good example : it provides functionality similar to Ruby 's built - in case expressions , with pattern matching on scalar values .
This is n't anywhere near as powerful as data - structure pattern matching , but it captures some of the spirit of it .
Is n't learning new abstractions spiffy ?
I think so .
And that , folks , is why I study and write about programming languages .
It 's NOT to tell everyone to use OCaml at Amazon ( Mike ) .
Psh !
Handling that Pesky Cost Issue Our " little " tech detour was a lot longer than I expected it to be .
Oh well .
My main point today is supposed to be about choosing languages with an eye towards optimizing cost , so let 's talk about that a bit .
For the record , I agree 100 % with the many folks who argue ( sometimes coming awfully close to spitting on me in their passion about it ) that using too many languages , or obscure languages , has a high cost .
Yep .
It sure does .
Thank you for not spitting .
When discussing cost optimization , I tend to classify programming languages four broad categories : Production Languages - languages that you use for building robust , scalable production systems .
It 's a pretty short list : C , C++ , Java , and maybe C - sharp or Objective - C ( but only maybe ) .
They have to be popular , they should be statically typed , they need to perform well , they need great tools and documentation , etc .
Not many options in this category .
Scripting Languages - languages you use for doing things that C , C++ and Java totally suck at , like string processing , OS automation , data munging , backfills , that kind of thing .
Again , you want to use popular ones , so you 're stuck with Perl , Ruby , Python , or the built - in Unix-y ones like shell - script and awk ( although if you 're gonna do that , you almost always want to use Perl / Python / Ruby because they have more expressive power and more libraries . )
Yeah , I know , people who love scripting languages want to believe they 're great for building giant scalable systems .
I wish they were .
They 're certainly awesome for prototyping , and they seem to work well for user - interface creation ( e.g. with Mason ) .
But I 'm a bit skeptical about building a large production system in a weakly - typed language , for lots of reasons : refactoring tool support , general code readability , performance , blah blah blah .
I hope someday someone proves me wrong here , but for now , I think you want to use dynamically - typed languages only in certain niches .
If you feel I 'm wrong , please do n't mail me with a long rant ; publish your thoughts as a blog somewhere !
Studyable Languages - languages like Lisp , Scheme , OCaml , Haskell , Eiffel , Erlang , etc. , that have cool features that you 'd love to use , if only these languages were actually popular .
But I would n't use any of them in production .
( Lisp is a special case that I 'm still trying to figure out , so let 's leave it as a " maybe / sometimes " for now . )
Languages you 're stuck with - e.g. , JavaScript for client - side browser automation , Tcl for automating TotalView , Emacs - Lisp for Emacs , or any other language that you have to use because you depend on a product that requires it .
There 's no help for you here - you just have to know them if you want to be maximally productive with that product , and sometimes you do n't have a choice .
So where does that leave us ?
So where does that leave us ?
I think when you 're deciding what language to use for " real " work , you want to choose as follows :
Only consider popular languages .
Veeeeeery important .
Critical , even .
Pick the right language category for your problem .
For systems up to a certain size , you probably want a good dynamic / scripting language , and beyond that point , use C++ , Java or maybe C# .
Once you 've decided the category , always use the highest - level language in the list .
Use the one that 's the most modern , expressive , and the least prone to errors when placed in the hands of busy / stressed programmers .
If there 's a tie , pick the one that 's easiest to learn .
You should n't worry about language performance - that 's a premature optimization .
Remember that we 're writing server - side software , and it does n't need to run on our customers ' desktops .
Programmer time is very expensive , so pick a language that makes the best use of programmer time .
Your profiler will take care of the rest .
You should n't worry about whether you or your team know the language or not .
That 's being short - sighted .
You may see more progress initially , but over time , you 're losing out on the gains they 'd get from having switched to a more productive language environment .
I realize all this flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that you should put performance first .
Our industry is still largely slave to performance ( and to running on the client desktop ) .
C and C++ are still the only options for most companies , and performance is more important for them than " human " factors like code maintainability , build times , development speed , and so on .
But for Amazon and other web - based companies , the landscape has changed significantly .
C++ and Perl may have been the only viable options in the late 90's , but that 's simply not true anymore .
And I think that unless we re-examine our options , and try to optimize for human cost instead of hardware cost , we 're actually spending more money to do the same amount of work .
A lot more .
I know there are plenty of smart people at Amazon who , at this point in the article , are ready to lynch me , but hey , this is just a magazine .
They 're welcome to write up their opinions too !
The Punch Line I 've spent a very long time trying to find the best solution to this multi-dimensional cost-optimization problem : about 2 years , in fact , part - time at home , studying and learning something like 40 programming languages .
I care about this problem a lot , both for my own productivity and for Amazon 's , since I plan to be here for a good long while .
I 'm fairly convinced that for the forseeable future ( i.e. the next 5 years or so ) , the right languages -- for me anyway -- are Java and Ruby .
Java for big stuff , Ruby for small - to - medium stuff .
I can hear the cries of anger erupting already .
My inbox overfloweth , and all that .
Remember , I said for me .
You can use whatever you like .
My only recommendation is that you do n't decide by fiat .
Give it some thought ; do n't assume that the language you 're most comfortable with today is automatically the right one for your next project .
And do n't forget the " Languages You 're Stuck With " category .
I 'd probably rather customize Emacs using Ruby than Emacs - Lisp , but elisp is my only choice for now .
If you use VIM or Eclipse , you have more options .
But you 'll always need to know a few extra languages in order to get the most out of your tools .
You can never get away with just two languages , not if you want to be efficient .
The punch line , then , is this : I 'll use Java and Ruby when I can , and other languages when I have to .
And I 'll keep an eye on all of them , since you never know when some new one 's gonna be totally ... groovy .

I saw this video Joe Sudbay posted this morning and thought it was worth passing along .
Rachel Maddow tried to point out the fallacies in Joe Scarborough 's glowing , fact - free praise of John McCain on MSNBC 's Race For The White House .
The Scar continues to spew this ridiculous media narrative that John McCain is a " maverick , " completely disregarding the myriad of flip flops the aging Arizona senator has made over the past year .
Rachel tries to put him in his place , reminding him that McCain has been pandering to the right on all the major issues including permanent tax cuts , immigration and torture , but all Scarborough does is tell her that she does n't understand the Republican party .
True dat , since she is the lone voice of reason and we all know that facts have a liberal bias .
Scarborough loves to steamroll Mika Brzezkinski on his morning show , but as you 'll see from this video , his bullying style gets him nowhere with Maddow .
Partial transcript with links to facts below the fold
JS : He refused to tell Tim Russert that he made a mistake voting against — he was one of two Republicans that voted against Bush ’s tax cuts .
Conservatives will tell you that two things that Bush did right …
RM : And then he changed his mind about them , Joe .
JS : No , he has n’t changed his mind .
RM : He says he wants them to be permanent now …
JS : He told Tim Russert on Meet the Press in New Hampshire when his life … political life was on the line that he made the right call .
He was glad he voted against them .
RM : And now he wants them to be made permanent .
He is …
He ’s pandering to the right and it defies the media happy talk that they like about John McCain …
JS : Okay … whatever …
RM : … but how else to do you explain going after the John Hagee endorsement , going after the Rod Parsley endorsement …
JS : Okay … You know what ?
Let ’s see , let ’s see …the Democrats …
RM : … changing his mind on torture , changing his mind on the tax cuts …
JS : Rachel… Good lord …
RM : I ’m sorry , but the facts do n’t meet … do n’t meet your storyline here , but the storyline ought to change to conform to the facts , rather than denying the facts .
JS : Rachel , if you compare , let me just say this .
Compare the rigid ideological views of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton with the Democratic Party .
The most progressive people in the Democratic Party .
Compare that to what John McCain did with the Republican Party .
There is no comparison .
McCain has gone more towards the middle over the past four years than either of those two .
That ’s just the bottom line .
RM : That ’s absolutely incorrect .
… and that is the ability to quickly perform a search .
However , when I simply type http://www.google.com into my browser , I get this sorry page with a Captcha down the bottom .
It is starting to become annoying , I have n’t even searched for anything yet – I ’m just hitting their homepage .
Actually I think that there is something behind this , because what they are doing is so bone headed that there must be an ulterior motive .
I think that they are training a neural net .
OK , so before you label me as a conspiracy theorist lets look at it .
Google probably gets more hits than any other site on the web .
Now , if they start getting their users to start solving captchas then they basically have one half of a feedback mechanism required for training a neural net .
Eventually they ’ll come up with a network that can solve captchas and allow the Google search - bot to bypass those simple “ are you a human ” checks that people have all over the place .
In fact , given the speed with which people will be hitting the Google site they may not even need the neural network because they could just serve up replicas of the captchas that their search - bot is coming across and get a search user to solve it real - time .
The Sorry screen is just an interface that Google is using to harness the human brain .
We already know Google is interested in this space , and this is just a way of ramping up their computational capability .
A Man Impossible to Classify
by Richard Whittaker , Dec 21 , 2007
One of my first experiences in San Francisco was of being flagged down by a stranger as I drove toward the intersection of Stanyan and Frederick Streets at the edge of Golden Gate Park .
My friend Malcolm Hall and I , both college students , had driven up the coast highway from Los Angeles in my 1953 Plymouth .
The year was 1965 .
We were headed toward the Haight - Ashbury .
Maybe thirty yards short of the intersection , I saw him standing on the curb , a disheveled young man , not quite in the hippie mold .
He was looking directly at me it seemed , and gesturing emphatically , an incongruous grin on his face .
As the car moved closer , my expression must have revealed my uncertainty because he nodded his head .
Yes .
It was me he was gesturing to .
I turned to Malcolm with a look , “ should we ? ” Malcolm was non-committal .
I pulled over .
The young man walked up to us still smiling and , without a word , pointed again .
I stared in puzzlement .
At this he nodded his head and , to clarify matters , repeated the pointing .
“ What do you mean ? ” I managed to ask .
“ Donuts ! ” He said .
“ Do you guys like donuts ? ”
I saw it then , a donut shop right ahead of us at the intersection .
Whatever threat this smiling stranger — maybe five foot eight — might represent stemmed more from his assault on my sense of social convention than anything else .
Besides , there were two of us .
The hippie revolution was in full flower and things were going on that crossed a lot of boundaries .
Was n’t this , in some basic way , part of the idea ?
I parked the car and Malcolm and I walked over to the donut shop with our new friend .
Taking a cue from him , it would seem nothing could have been more exciting than getting some glazed donuts and maybe a coffee together , the three of us !
This was something I could never have dreamt up on my own , an adventure both too banal and too transgressive at the same time .
Walking in , we found a booth and sat down , Malcolm and I sat facing the stranger across the table .
“ What ’s your name ? ”
" Laurie . "
That ’s a girl ’s name , I could n’t help thinking .
“ How do you spell that ? ”
Laurie just stared at me with his big smile , and nodded .
He had a scraggly beard and his teeth were uneven .
“ How do you spell that ? ” I asked again .
“ L-a-u- r - i-e . ”
The smile remained along with his direct gaze on us both .
He did n’t seem uncomfortable , at least .
“ Do you live around here ? ”
An awkward conversation hitched along for a few minutes and then he said , “ Let ’s get some donuts .
Do n’t you guys want some ? ”
“ Sure . ” I said , getting up .
“ Can we get you some ? ”
“ Thanks !
Maybe some coffee , too , ” he said .
I do n’t think I ’d ever met a street person before .
In 1965 I ’m not sure that phrase had even come into usage .
There were tramps and bums and , by then , beats , beatniks and of course , most immediately , hippies .
But in Laurie ’s case , no category quite seemed to fit .
This was a situation I ’d have to face without them .
Struggling to relate as we ate our donuts , we swapped basic information .
We told him we were visiting and would be heading back to LA in a few days .
Were we going to pass through Monterey ?
he wondered .
Could we drop him off there ?
We told Laurie we ’d check in with him on our way out of town and he gave us an address .
The conversation hitched along .
When it faltered , Laurie just looked at us with a silent grin , not making small talk to smooth things out .
When we finished our donuts , I was happy to escape .
When the morning came to head back to LA we found the address , a boarded - up house .
Approaching cautiously , I pried back a piece of plywood .
“ Hey Laurie ! ” I shouted into the shadows .
After a couple of tries an answer came back from the shadows and , sure enough , Laurie appeared .
“ You guys ! ”
He was not expecting us .
We ’d awakened him .
“ Come in , ” he said .
Enough light was coming in here and there to permit seeing a dilapidated couch , an old coffee table and a couple of chairs .
“ Wow , ” he said , and just looked at us .
“ You guys actually came back . ”
I could n’t help wondering what routines of betrayal put our simple act in such a light .
“ Do you guys want to listen to some of my songs ? ”
“ What about Monterey ? ” I asked .
No , he could n’t go down there today .
But did we want to hear some of his music ?
Where I come from , you do n’t refuse certain things and this seemed like one of those moments .
Laurie disappeared and returned with an old acoustic guitar .
His singing was n’t so good .
That was my first reaction .
But as I listened something else came in , a feeling .
It ’s what I remember most .
He finished his song and said , " I 've got a tape of more of my songs . "
Reaching for a beat up tape player , he said , “ Hey , wait here .
I ’ll be right back , ” and disappeared into the darkness of the abandoned house .
Malcolm and I sat listening to the tape player and its tiny speaker .
Yes , the same quality I 'd heard before was coming through it , too .
If I had to pick one word for it , it would be something like heartbreaking .
My encounter with Laurie , as brief as it was , left unforgettable impressions .
Moreover , by a twist of fate , it was not the last I ’d see of him .
In fact , it was just the beginning .
THREE YEARS LATER
By 1968 I ’d lived in San Francisco for two years and had recently moved in with a woman I ’d fallen in love with .
In North Beach , she ’d cut quite a figure .
Besides being tall and beautiful , she ’d become a bit of a celebrity among the locals .
One of the characters Karen had become friends with was named Laurie Seagel .
“ You know Laurie ? ” I asked in astonishment .
“ Laurie Seagel ? ”
Karen and I lived at the top of Vallejo Street on Telegraph Hill and I began to run into Laurie regularly .
Sometimes we had Laurie over for dinner along with street poet Johnny Woodrose , who I ’d met while running a poetry program in the basement of a church near Haight St. Before my move to North Beach I ’d occasionally seen Laurie at free concerts in Golden Gate Park where The Jefferson Airplane , Buffalo Springfield and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin often performed for free .
Laurie sometimes jumped up on stage and tried to grab a mike to join in on harmonica .
His harmonica playing was n’t any better than his guitar playing , but he seemed unfazed by such considerations .
He ’d always get ushered off the stage , but I could n’t help noticing that the band members all seemed to know Laurie and never seemed much upset with his antics .
A longer account of my friendship with Laurie is for another time .
But his freedom from worry about what others might think is one of his qualities I remember most clearly .
It was something I witnessed time and again in many different ways .
Perhaps this quality struck me so much because of my own lack in that regard .
There were many other things I learned about him that surprised me .
He ’d been a gifted philosophy student at Stanford University and related amazing stories about his time spent with Gregory Bateson ’s family , Richard Alpert and others .
From time to time , Laurie would say something with a strong inflection of Zen .
I remember asking him about it .
Yes , he used to love being around Suzuki Roshi , the head of the San Francisco Zen Center .
He told me about having a meal there one day .
The monks were having a silent lunch and he managed to join the group , but Laurie was n’t interested in keeping the silence .
He kept attempting conversation with the monks sitting at table with him .
Finally one of the monks complained .
" If he ’s going to talk , why ca n’t the rest of us ? "
Suzuki replied , “ For Laurie , it ’s allowed . ”
Laurie was a man impossible to classify .
Given his talents , whatever obstacles stood in the way of conventional success must have been powerful .
But the most obvious problem he faced was addiction .
He ’d been shooting up amphetamines at least since I ’d first met him in 1965 .
He ’d suffered from hepatitis at least once if not two or three times .
Listening to his stories , I learned that he ’d been arrested several times , too .
He ’d been severely beaten at least once while in jail by another inmate and had also been beaten more than once by police .
He went through difficult times , but was always far more dangerous to himself than to anyone else .
By 1968 the years of physical abuse were showing up in mental as well as physical symptoms .
Laurie ’s future appeared grim indeed .
Then one day , I got a call from Laurie .
He ’d been in Napa State Hospital detoxing and now was out .
Somehow he ’d managed to get an airline ticket to Israel .
“ It ’s my last chance , ” he told me .
Could he borrow a sleeping bag to take with him ?
I wondered if it was a flight of fancy , but a few days later , Laurie showed up at the door .
I handed over the sleeping bag , we embraced , and I wished him the best of luck .
Laurie did go to Israel .
He joined a Kibbutz .
A year later , I got a letter from him .
He had married a beautiful Israeli , Talilah .
He ’d become a social worker .
Why did n’t I come over and visit ?
As the next few years passed , I got more messages .
First there was one child , Hadar , then Sagi then a third .
I have forgotten the name .
Then a few years later , I got a call from Talila .
Laurie had died from liver failure .
She told me a story about Laurie ’s social work in Israel .
She told me how hard it was , the low pay .
He worked with addicts and others , and was much loved , she said .
People thought he had mysterious powers .
She told me of a woman who wanted to have children .
She had tried everything .
No luck .
But one day Laurie met with her and held her hand .
" You are going to have children , " he told her .
" Do n’t worry . "
Shortly thereafter , Talilah told me , the woman conceived .
She did have a child .
I do n’t remember exactly when Laurie gave me a copy of a manuscript he ’d written , All Men Shall Be Gods , but I still have it .
For years , I ’ve wanted to publish a particular section from it , a remarkable account of an experiment in living he carried out in San Francisco in the early 1960s before he fell under the sway of amphetamines .
I feel compelled to underline how striking I find this singular inquiry to have been .
It 's an ontological adventure that could easily have remained untold and I 'm grateful , finally , to be able to share it with others .
Here is that excerpt .
Laurie Seagel writes :
I decided to try to find out what were man ’s basic needs .
I would live without most things I was accustomed to and see what it would be like .
I decided to give up words ; I would only say “ yes , ” “ yes ” to every question , nothing more , a nod of the head would usually suffice .
I would give up things ; sandals , a thin shirt and a thin pair of pants would be enough .
I knew I could adjust to temperatures in San Francisco through bodily relaxation .
The fewer clothes the better ; I would worry about changing when the need arose .
Nothing in my pockets , nothing , no money , no identification , nothing .
And no place .
I would break the habit of thinking “ where ” and “ where to ? ”
All places would be equal .
I would try to learn to be comfortable anywhere .
I hid a sleeping bag in the bushes near Coit Tower , the highest point on Telegraph Hill , though I ended up sleeping in it only once .
The rest of my belongings I hauled over to the family home in Oakland .
Usually , I wore a hat pulled down low .
I sat , relaxed my body , and watched , or listened — looked and listened .
I sat in Cassandra ’s , in the Coffee Gallery , the Bagel Shop , The Place — these were the main gathering spots for people I knew .
There was also the Cellar Jazz Club , evenings .
Still later some nights after the Cellar closed , we sojourned across town to the Black Fillmore district where jazz was played until early morning at Jimbo ’s Bop City .
Or I ’d go off by myself , as most of the others went home .
When Cassandra ’s closed , I ’d cross the street where a small cafe was good for a short stop .
The small hours of the morning , three to five , I ’d spend in a variety of regular ways .
Lying among the empty bins in the Italian bakery on Grant just above Green , I watched the bakers working , kneading , arranging , shoving the long rows of loaves into the great oven — rhythm , movement , fire and quiet Italian talk .
I enjoyed the warmth and the smell , enjoyed watching them work , like a dance it was — and they always welcomed me .
I was a spectator whose enjoyment in watching them heightened their own enjoyment in the work .
Invariably one of them would thrust a fresh loaf of bread upon me when I rose to leave .
Another activity for three to five in the morning was walking through the bustling , bright and raucous produce market located then at easy walking distance from North Beach .
My eyes delighted in the colors of the fruits and vegetables , and I felt energy from the surging of the men and their machines , the helter - skelter of it all .
Here too , people got used to seeing me among them .
I was always silent and happy , smiling from the delight my eyes were beholding .
I was joyous watching the beauty of existence .
Here in the produce market people called me “ wolf - man , ” I suppose because my hair was long and shaggy , but they always acted toward me with friendliness and offered me fruit , which I ate .
When I was especially tired , during these pre-dawn hours and at other times also , I went into rhythmical walking , sometimes for long distances around San Francisco , long rhythmical strides , arms swinging .
The action sort of turned me on , got me high , rested me .
Every day , before the sun rose , I climbed to the top of Telegraph Hill somewhere alongside of Coit Tower , to sit and meditate .
From my spot , all the sounds of the bay down below me in an arc left , right and center rose up directly , undisturbed by any edifice .
I sat , relaxed deeply , deeply , and listened , watched .
The sounds of the ships , of the city , of the birds were pleasant to me .
I enjoyed them every day , day after day , for hours at a time .
When I began hearing the coarser hum of human voices — tourists appeared about nine in the morning to look out on the bay — I lay down where I was and slept for a few hours .
I liked sleeping in the sun .
When I awoke , I usually went to Washington Square Park , or down through Fisherman ’s Wharf to Aquatic Park .
On the grass of Washington Square , or the sand of Aquatic Park , I ’d catch some more sleep in the sun , sometimes swim in the bay at Aquatic Park , eat raw fish at the wharf , or I would sit and watch , listen , or be together with friends — “ beatniks ” we were beginning to be called after Chronicle columnist Herb Caen put together Kerouac ’s “ beat ” with the “ nik ” from the Russian “ Sputnik . ”
Looking and listening were for me ways of quieting my mind , teaching it to not think , breaking habits of thought like : what to do ?
where to go ?
But after awhile , looking and listening became something much more ; I came to see and to hear the world , existence , more and more acutely .
The more I watched and listened , the more I saw and heard , more keenly , more distinctly .
Every day I gained more and more pleasure from this listening and looking , always seeing and hearing more clearly .
As time went on , I appreciated how glorious and beautiful existence is , living .
I saw how busy , preoccupied were most people with doing , making .
Existence was already so much to enjoy , so grand and lovely , so exquisite .
Just to see , to hear the sights and sounds that were there made me happy and delighted .
I was truly happy and at peace .
Everywhere .
All the time .
Throughout those eight months , or a year — I ’m not sure exactly how many months went by — I had not the slightest inkling of trouble of any kind .
The two policemen on the beat , when they passed me they said , “ Hi Laurie , ” and that was that .
I did what I wanted , when I wanted to , sometimes with others , but most often alone .
I roamed freely , drank lots of water , ate enough somehow and was always serene in enjoyment of the beauty of all I saw unfolding before me , day into night , night again into day : the warmth of the sun , the cool breezes , the fog , the wind , the sea , sky and stars , trees , flowers , children playing , old people , young mothers with their children , the Chinese , the Italians , the French , the Basque .
My attention became so keen I saw in crowded coffee shops and meeting places , how people ’s bodies reacted to each other ’s without their consciously knowing it .
When I sat at a live jazz session , my hearing was so sharp , it was like what poets call “ a sensitive ear in the audience . ”
I would hear each particular instrument , separately .
The musicians told me that when I listened , they began to hear themselves more distinctly , then each heard the other , and the music grew in intensity and those jam sessions were really something else … at the Cellar , and on weekends , at the Coffee Gallery .
It was all a part of that community spirit which existed , the spirit that both allowed me to be on “ this trip ” and to live freely in the midst of it .
The life of North Beach nourished me , fed my spirit and my body .
It was fun to be with this happy throng , to share with them the sounds of talk , laughter , music , nature , the clanging of the cable car bell , the sound of the seagulls , Sonny ’s saxophone , Max ’s bass fiddle , Bill Wiesjon ’s piano , Chuck Taylor ’s drums .
What are the basic needs of man ?
What did I learn during this time ?
I lived very contentedly on almost nothing .
I required little sleep and little food .
I drank water copiously , had abundant sunshine , walked and ran tremendous amounts , meditated , rested much , did not feel the need for sex , though I enjoyed frequent human companionship , or at least proximity .
I came to regard my needs as so scant that you could say that what you need is what you want .
Air , water , rest , exercise , a little food , this is all I seemed to need .
I did have an acute sense of something like regret or sorrow that other people were not enjoying existence as much as I was then .
If only they could sit more quietly and look , listen , feel .
I felt that people could live better that way and that society would be better , life would be better that way .
But I did n’t talk .
I did n’t think I could start talking and somehow teach people to be that way , change the world .
When I finally did decide to end this period , I just hoped that somehow , some way , I could express what I had experienced and learned and somehow bring some of it back into existence , at least into my own existence , and perhaps for others as well …
Emmitt Smith is the man .
I 'm serious - the last thing I 'm being right now is facetious .
Despite his inability to speak English , Emmitt sits in front of the camera , broadcasting to millions of homes in the U.S. , and speaks incorrectly and incoherently every single week .
He 's a hero - and a very entertaining one at that .
I made sure I was up at 11 every Sunday morning this fall just to hear Emmitt speak .
Sure , I was writing down all of his grammatically incorrect sentences and phrases , but that 's why he was so fun to watch .
I really hope ESPN does n't let him go .
If they do , I 'm going to switch to another network .
I do n't think I could live without posting my weekly Emmitt quotes on this site .
In hoping ESPN extends Emmitt 's contract and offers him billions of dollars ( let 's face it , he 's the most entertaining man on TV ) , I 've compiled all of the Emmitt quotes I 've posted on this site or kept in reserve .
I just pray that I can do this again next year .
Emmitt Smith may look and speak like an idiot , but he 's really a genius whose entertainment level is unparalleled .

The UN describes trafficking as a form of " slavery " .
It knows of victims from 127 countries and of their exploitation in 137 .
Major destinations for victims include wealthy countries in Western Europe , North America , and the Middle East .
Women are involved in 77 % of trafficking cases worldwide , with sexual exploitation a factor in 87 % .
Forced labour is also a motive behind trafficking .
What is the situation in the UK ?
The UK is a major destination for trafficked women .
Police believe that about 4,000 have been brought in to the country and forced to work as prostitutes .
Criminal gangs bring them into the country individually or in small , escorted groups .
The routes used can change quickly , although some broad routes have been identified .
Victims are found " all over the UK , not just in metropolitan areas " , police say .
The gangs behind the trade buy and sell the women for between £ 2,000 and £ 8,000 .
Some have been forced to work 16 hours and have sex with 30 men a day .
Who are the victims ?
Many trafficking victims in the UK are from Eastern European countries including Lithuania , Russia , Albania and Ukraine .
Others are from the Far East , South America and Africa .
Often , women are lured by adverts in their home countries for jobs such as restaurant staff , maids and child minders .
Some expect to work as lap dancers or escorts , but not to be prostitutes .
Others do know they are going to work as prostitutes , but are lied to about conditions .
The age of victims varies widely , but most are between 18 and 24 .
Police have also rescued a number of children .
Many victims are " from poor backgrounds with little or no education " , the UK Human Trafficking Centre reports .
What happens once they are in the UK ?
Victims can end up in any town or city where brothels operate .

Others have been allowed to pay off their " debts " to the traffickers .
Rebellious Teen ?
A Brain Area May Hold the Key New research says the size of a key brain area may play a part in aggression .
Feb. 25 , 2008  --
For many parents , raising a teen is an exercise in conflict management .
And besides the usual battles over curfews , clothing choices and academic performance , some teens seem to seek out conflict with their parents more often than others .
For decades , researchers have tried to unravel the secrets behind parent - teen conflict .
Now , child development experts are scrutinizing a new study that suggests the size of small , almond shaped structures in the center of the brain known as the amygdalae may hold the key to how aggressive teens behave toward their parents .
Scientists have already known that this area of the brain is heavily involved in emotional responses , and previous research has linked it to the fight - or - flight behaviors that typify our bodies ' responses to emergency situations .
But researchers at the University of Melbourne 's Orygen Research Center in Australia report that these areas of the brain may have a special link when it comes to teens who regularly fight with their parents .
The researchers looked at 137 teens and their parents who participated in a problem - solving task that was designed to cause conflict .
After measuring the degree of fighting the teens experienced with their parents , the researchers had the adolescent volunteers undergo MRI brain scans to measure the size of their amygdalae .
What they found was that the larger their amygdalae , the more likely the kids were to fight with their folks .
" One of the things we found in our study was the children whose amygdalae were larger were more likely to spend a longer amount time being aggressive or angry with their parents during an interaction , so there was a relation to size of the amygdalae and how angry or aggressive the child was during the interaction , " says lead study author Nick Allen , associate professor at the University of Melbourne 's School of Behavioral Science .
Tiny Brain Structures
Not the Big Picture
But the findings , which were released Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , are already brewing debate among child development experts .
In particular , some are concerned that the research could lead to a conclusion that it is the large amygdalae of aggressive teens that necessarily fuels conflict , when a number of other biological and social factors may be to blame .
" The problem with this kind of research is that it is correlational and only demonstrates an association , " says Merritt Schreiber of the UCLA National Center for Child Traumatic Stress .
" Even though not explicitly said , the underlying tendency is to assume this means causation -- in other words , that the structural changes cause aggression . "
Others agree .
" It says nothing about cause at all or interaction among factors leading to the results , which is likely extremely complex , " says Daniel Kupper , assistant clinical professor of psychology and psychiatry at UCLA .
" I 'm not even certain there is much agreement as to what the size of the amygdala indicates , or how good the data is on normal amygdala size in adolescence . "
Still , some child development experts say that the findings make sense , given what 's already known about the amygdala .
" Amygdala overfunction creates a propensity to overreact to ... stressors and difficulty in disengaging in conflicts , " says Kendall Johnson , a clinician in private practice in California and author of the books " Trauma in the Lives of Children " and " Dealing with Classroom Crisis . "
" Like firefighters rushing into a burning building while the rest of us run out , teens with biologically based overreactivity tend to be attracted to conflict , exacerbate it , and not be able to think their way out of it , " Johnson says .
" Parents can learn to understand their children 's violent behavior as a symptom of an underlying dysfunction rather than a sign of poor character or an indictment of bad parenting . "
But Schreiber remains concerned that focusing too much on the size of one particular brain structure -- and not enough on a multitude of other biological and social factors -- would be tantamount to ignoring 40 years of research on other factors that could contribute to teen aggression .
These factors , he says , include parenting practices and media influences .
Dr. Barbara Korsch , professor of pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California , says ignoring these past findings could misdirect parents in dealing with their teens ' problems with aggression .
" More and more malfunction is being attributed to ill - understood deviations in morphology and physiology , " she says .
" This may have one possible benefit -- to reduce parents ' feelings of self - blame .
But until we know a lot more , I think these are by far outweighed by the dangers in ' labeling ' these adolescents as abnormal and doomed to conflict .
" We have so much established knowledge of the tremendous significance of family function , environmental pressures and education on these behaviors that I choose to stay with these explanations . "
More Research on the Way
But even though it cannot yet be said for sure whether larger amygdalae can be blamed for aggression in teens , Allen says his current research aims to determine just that .
Specifically , he says that monitoring how the teens in this study fare over the years may help scientists draw a clearer picture of how , exactly , changes in the amygdalae and other biological factors fit in with teen aggression .
" We 're certainly not saying this explains everything , or that this explains away bad behavior , " Allen says .
" Kids still need to be encouraged to have responsibility for their own behavior .
But I think it 's also good for parents to be realistic and to have an understanding that these kids are still growing .
" And the parts of the brain that are still developing and growing are the parts that control emotions and behavior , so when you see them behaving in ways that seem inexplicable -- that seem crazy -- at times , part of the explanation for that will be the biological changes the child is going through .

Abandoned mine shafts honeycomb the surrounding hillsides .
The old drainage tunnel , built by the federal government in 1943 to drain hundreds of these shafts , began falling apart in the 1970s , causing water to pool .
In 2005 , the E.P.A. offered to start pumping the clogged water toward a Bureau of Reclamation plant , which treats the water flowing through the tunnel ; but the bureau contended that the additional water was part of the E.P.A. ’s Superfund cleanup responsibility .
A plan for the state to take over the plant subsequently fell through .
Last year , the warnings grew louder .
Brad Littlepage , who manages the Bureau of Reclamation treatment plant , says he told supervisors , to no avail , about the tunnel ’s deterioration .
The risk , as he and other experts saw it , was that pressure from the backed - up water had become so intense that it threatened to burst through the blockages and cascade out of the tunnel .

[ The Register ]
An Australian father and daughter who conceived an apparently healthy child are being monitored by police and social services after going public about their incestuous relationship .
John Deaves , 61 , and his daughter Jenny , 39 , say they want to be treated as an ordinary couple despite being biologically related , but their case has sparked outrage .
Court documents have revealed that a child they had earlier died from a congenital heart defect a few days after birth .
The couple , who have pleaded guilty to incest and been banned by a judge from having sexual contact , appeared on a television news programme in Australia to tell their story .
They were shown with their nine - month - old daughter , Celeste , who they said was fit and well .
" John and I are in this relationship as consenting adults , " Ms Deaves told The Nine Network .
" We are just asking for a little bit of respect and understanding . "
Mr Deaves married Ms Deaves 's mother 40 years ago , but she divorced him while he was in prison serving a sentence for armed robbery .
Ms Deaves did not see her father again until eight years ago , by which time she was married and had two children .
She said there was an immediate
physical attraction between her and her father , and that two weeks after meeting , the couple had sex .
Ms Deaves described the relationship with her father as being like " a sexual relationship with any other man " .
Her father , who was also married at the time , admitted on television that initially he thought the relationship was wrong .
" I knew it was illegal , " he said .
" Of course I knew it was illegal .
But so what ?
Emotions take over . "
The pair , who left their spouses and moved together to South Australia , were investigated by the department of families and communities .
When police questioned them , both made full admissions .
Last month , a judge acknowledged that their relationship was a " mutually consensual union " , and ruled that they could still see other but that they would be placed on a good behaviour bond and were banned from having sex .
He said that during sentencing he had taken into account the high risk of congenital defects of children born from incestuous relationships , and the psychological harm such children could suffer .
There have been calls , however , for the couple 's young daughter and Ms Deaves 's two other children , who are living with them , to be put into care .
Mr Deaves 's ex-wife , Dorothy , whom he left for his daughter , has also disputed claims that the two were strangers to each other , saying Ms Deaves attended their wedding when she was aged 15 .
Psychologists say biologically related people can experience " genetic sexual attraction " but incest is taboo in most countries because of the health risks to children born of such unions .
A German brother and sister are currently fighting for the right to continue their sexual relationship , and are challenging incest laws .
They have four children together , three of whom are in foster care .

NEW YORK — A handful of journalists filed into a small theater at the Park Avenue Screening Room here last night to see a preview for " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed . "
The 90 - minute documentary - style flick features Ben Stein , a comedian , lawyer , actor and former speechwriter .
It is a movie about the so - called debate between supporters of " intelligent design " and Charles Darwin 's scientific theory of evolution .
Filmmakers proclaim in press materials that Stein " discovers an elitist scientific establishment that has traded in its skepticism for dogma " during the course of the movie through interviews with scientists and anti-evolution advocates .
Some scientists , however , are outraged about the conduct of the filmmaker during production and screening as well as the film 's effort to tie Darwin 's ideas to Hitler .
One prominent scientist who is in the movie has since called it shoddy and sinister .
Intelligently designed
Intelligent design , or ID , holds that life on Earth is so complex that evolutionary theory can't explain the complexities , so life must have been designed .
Scientists see it as creationism veiled in pseudoscience , an effort with religious backing designed to generate the appearance of controversy among scientists about Darwinian evolution where there is none .
ID has made headlines in recent years in Kansas , Ohio and Michigan as school boards and courts contested its teaching in public schools alongside evolution , which is a scientific theory holding that new species appear via gradual changes in inherited traits and mutations .
In 2005 , a federal judge barred a Pennsylvania public school district from teaching ID in biology class .
The basic principles of neither evolution nor ID are clearly explained in the movie .
" Expelled " is smattered with gloomy scenes of the Berlin Wall 's construction , the Holocaust and other World War II - era footage , with Stein arguing during the course of it that a handful of academics have been persecuted for their beliefs that run counter to the scientific establishment .
Many of the ID supporters and sympathizers Stein interviews in the movie , however , were let go , not offered tenure or other career incentives because of expired contracts , improper publishing ethics and other conduct unrelated to their religious views , according to university and institution spokespeople who appeared in " Expelled . "
Stein claims he " encountered many more [ academics ] who did n't want to appear on film , " because of their fear of being persecuted .
But among the millions of scientists currently working in schools and institutions across the world , thousands of whom are trained evolutionary biologists , the overwhelming consensus is that evolution is a well - supported theory backed by observations in several fields using multiple lines of evidence .
Foul play ?
Scientists interviewed in " Expelled , " namely evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins of Oxford University and Paul Zachary " PZ " Myers of the University of Minnesota and author of the blog " Pharyngula , " have been crying foul since the movie 's name was changed last year .
The two have written on their Web sites and blogs that the original film was called " Crossroads : The Intersection of Science and Religion " based on correspondence with Mark Mathis , the movie 's associate producer at Rampant Films .
But in late 2007 the movie title was changed to " Expelled " for marketing reasons , the producers reportedly said .
In a press release issued by Premise Media , which has also helped finance " The Passion of the Christ " and " The Chronicles of Narnia " movies , film producer Walt Ruloff claims the makers avoided distorting interviews .
" The incredible thing about ' Expelled ' is that we do n’t resort to manipulating our interviews for the purpose of achieving the ' shock effect , ' " Ruloff said .
But Michael Schermer , editor of " Skeptic Magazine " and an on - screen interview in the movie , said Stein and Mathis asked him the same question a dozen times during his interview for the film to extract an answer they were looking for .
" In frustration I finally said something like ' Do you have any other questions to ask me or do you keep asking me this question in hopes that I 'll give a different answer ? ' " according to a statement by Schermer on richarddawkins .
net .
Questionable claims
Dawkins , Myers , Schermer and others are also outraged by the claims in the movie , especially that Charles Darwin 's evolutionary theory is partly responsible for Nazism and the Holocaust .
In the film , after Stein is told of this purported connection by several ID supporters , who also tell him that Darwin 's ideas of species fitness led to U.S. eugenics programs in the 1920s , Stein stares down a dimly lit statue of Darwin in London 's Natural History Museum .
During a March 28 telephone press conference for " Expelled , " Myers snuck in on the call and confronted the filmmakers about the issue .
" Have you ever heard of a pogrom ? "
Myers asked .
" Those have been going on for centuries . "
( A pogrom is an organized massacre of helpless people . )
On his Web site , Dawkins wrote that the Darwin - Nazi association is a fallacy .
" The alleged association between Darwinism and Nazism is harped on for what seems like hours , and it is quite simply an outrage , " Dawkins said of the series of scenes in the movie .
" Hitler was ignorant and bonkers enough for his hideous mind to have imbibed some sort of garbled misunderstanding of Darwin but it is hardly Darwin 's fault if he did . "
Expelled or uninvited ?
During a March 20 screening of " Expelled " at the Mall of America in Minneapolis , which Myers registered to attend via a public Web site with his family , he was asked to leave by security while standing in line .
The security guard said a film producer gave the orders to remove Myers from the theater .
According to various news reports , producers accused Myers of being a " gatecrasher " — someone trying to attend an event uninvited — but he was registered for the event via the open , online registration process .
Dawkins , who also registered to attend the screening , saw the documentary without incident along with Myers ' family .
" It 's an incredible piece of inept public relations to expel somebody … from a film about expelling people for their opinions , " Dawkins said during a videotaped discussion with Myers , " a film in which [ Myers is ] present , and acknowledged and thanked in the acknowledgements at the end of the film . "
The overall mood of the film , as its makers assert , is satirical and sarcastic — and almost always at the cost of the scientists backing evolutionary theory .
When Dawkins discusses scientific hypotheses for the seeding of life on Earth from another planet , for example , the film quickly displays black - and - white movie clips of flying saucers and aliens .
Dawkins said in the video on his Web site that he was unimpressed with the artistic direction of " Expelled . "
" I 'm not a professional filmmaker myself but I 've had a lot to do with making documentaries , " Dawkins said .
" This was a very , very shoddy , poor , inartistic piece of work . "
Dawkins also noted that images of guillotines , firing squads and other reactionary film clips that flashed between the words of sources especially garnered his dislike .
" It was worse than just artless , it was also quite sinister , " he said .
" It was a bad film in every way . "
" Expelled " opens in theaters nationwide starting on April 18 .

1 Introduction
Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin ?
The question invites two standard replies .
Some accept the demarcations of skin and skull , and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind .
Others are impressed by arguments suggesting that the meaning of our words " just ai n't in the head " , and hold that this externalism about meaning carries over into an externalism about mind .
We propose to pursue a third position .
We advocate a very different sort of externalism : an active externalism , based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes .
2 Extended Cognition
Consider three cases of human problem - solving :
(1) A person sits in front of a computer screen which displays images of various two - dimensional geometric shapes and is asked to answer questions concerning the potential fit of such shapes into depicted " sockets " .
To assess fit , the person must mentally rotate the shapes to align them with the sockets .
(2) A person sits in front of a similar computer screen , but this time can choose either to physically rotate the image on the screen , by pressing a rotate button , or to mentally rotate the image as before .
We can also suppose , not unrealistically , that some speed advantage accrues to the physical rotation operation .
(3) Sometime in the cyberpunk future , a person sits in front of a similar computer screen .
This agent , however , has the benefit of a neural implant which can perform the rotation operation as fast as the computer in the previous example .
The agent must still choose which internal resource to use ( the implant or the good old fashioned mental rotation ) , as each resource makes different demands on attention and other concurrent brain activity .
How much cognition is present in these cases ?
We suggest that all three cases are similar .
Case ( 3 ) with the neural implant seems clearly to be on a par with case ( 1 ) .
And case ( 2 ) with the rotation button displays the same sort of computational structure as case ( 3 ) , although it is distributed across agent and computer instead of internalized within the agent .
If the rotation in case ( 3 ) is cognitive , by what right do we count case ( 2 ) as fundamentally different ?
We cannot simply point to the skin / skull boundary as justification , since the legitimacy of that boundary is precisely what is at issue .
But nothing else seems different .
The kind of case just described is by no means as exotic as it may at first appear .
It is not just the presence of advanced external computing resources which raises the issue , but rather the general tendency of human reasoners to lean heavily on environmental supports .
Thus consider the use of pen and paper to perform long multiplication ( McClelland et al 1986 , Clark 1989 ) , the use of physical re-arrangements of letter tiles to prompt word recall in Scrabble ( Kirsh 1995 ) , the use of instruments such as the nautical slide rule ( Hutchins 1995 ) , and the general paraphernalia of language , books , diagrams , and culture .
In all these cases the individual brain performs some operations , while others are delegated to manipulations of external media .
Had our brains been different , this distribution of tasks would doubtless have varied .
In fact , even the mental rotation cases described in scenarios ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are real .
The cases reflect options available to players of the computer game Tetris .
In Tetris , falling geometric shapes must be rapidly directed into an appropriate slot in an emerging structure .
A rotation button can be used .
David Kirsh and Paul Maglio ( 1994 ) calculate that the physical rotation of a shape through 90 degrees takes about 100 milliseconds , plus about 200 milliseconds to select the button .
To achieve the same result by mental rotation takes about 1000 milliseconds .
Kirsh and Maglio go on to present compelling evidence that physical rotation is used not just to position a shape ready to fit a slot , but often to help determine whether the shape and the slot are compatible .
The latter use constitutes a case of what Kirsh and Maglio call an `epistemic action ' .
Epistemic actions alter the world so as to aid and augment cognitive processes such as recognition and search .
Merely pragmatic actions , by contrast , alter the world because some physical change is desirable for its own sake ( e.g. , putting cement into a hole in a dam ) .
Epistemic action , we suggest , demands spread of epistemic credit .
If , as we confront some task , a part of the world functions as a process which , were it done in the head , we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process , then that part of the world is ( so we claim ) part of the cognitive process .
Cognitive processes ain't ( all ) in the head !
3 Active Externalism
In these cases , the human organism is linked with an external entity in a two - way interaction , creating a coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right .
All the components in the system play an active causal role , and they jointly govern behavior in the same sort of way that cognition usually does .
If we remove the external component the system 's behavioral competence will drop , just as it would if we removed part of its brain .
Our thesis is that this sort of coupled process counts equally well as a cognitive process , whether or not it is wholly in the head .
This externalism differs greatly from standard variety advocated by Putnam ( 1975 ) and Burge ( 1979 ) .
When I believe that water is wet and my twin believes that twin water is wet , the external features responsible for the difference in our beliefs are distal and historical , at the other end of a lengthy causal chain .
Features of the present are not relevant : if I happen to be surrounded by XYZ right now ( maybe I have teleported to Twin Earth ) , my beliefs still concern standard water , because of my history .
In these cases , the relevant external features are passive .
Because of their distal nature , they play no role in driving the cognitive process in the here - and - now .
This is reflected by the fact that the actions performed by me and my twin are physically indistinguishable , despite our external differences .
In the cases we describe , by contrast , the relevant external features are active , playing a crucial role in the here - and - now .
Because they are coupled with the human organism , they have a direct impact on the organism and on its behavior .
In these cases , the relevant parts of the world are in the loop , not dangling at the other end of a long causal chain .
Concentrating on this sort of coupling leads us to an active externalism , as opposed to the passive externalism of Putnam and Burge .
Many have complained that even if Putnam and Burge are right about the externality of content , it is not clear that these external aspects play a causal or explanatory role in the generation of action .
In counterfactual cases where internal structure is held constant but these external features are changed , behavior looks just the same ; so internal structure seems to be doing the crucial work .
We will not adjudicate that issue here , but we note that active externalism is not threatened by any such problem .
The external features in a coupled system play an ineliminable role - if we retain internal structure but change the external features , behavior may change completely .
The external features here are just as causally relevant as typical internal features of the brain . [*]
* [[ Much of the appeal of externalism in the philosophy of mind may stem from the intuitive appeal of active externalism .
Externalists often make analogies involving external features in coupled systems , and appeal to the arbitrariness of boundaries between brain and environment .
But these intuitions sit uneasily with the letter of standard externalism .
In most of the Putnam / Burge cases , the immediate environment is irrelevant ; only the historical environment counts .
Debate has focused on the question of whether mind must be in the head , but a more relevant question in assessing these examples might be : is mind in the present ? ]]
By embracing an active externalism , we allow a more natural explanation of all sorts of actions .
One can explain my choice of words in Scrabble , for example , as the outcome of an extended cognitive process involving the rearrangement of tiles on my tray .
Of course , one could always try to explain my action in terms of internal processes and a long series of " inputs " and " actions " , but this explanation would be needlessly complex .
If an isomorphic process were going on in the head , we would feel no urge to characterize it in this cumbersome way . [*]
In a very real sense , the re-arrangement of tiles on the tray is not part of action ; it is part of thought .
* [[ Herbert Simon ( 1981 ) once suggested that we view internal memory as , in effect , an external resource upon which " real " inner processes operate .
" Search in memory , " he comments , " is not very different from search of the external environment . "
Simon 's view at least has the virtue of treating internal and external processing with the parity they deserve , but we suspect that on his view the mind will shrink too small for most people 's tastes . ]]
The view we advocate here is reflected by a growing body of research in cognitive science .
In areas as diverse as the theory of situated cognition ( Suchman 1987 ) , studies of real - world - robotics ( Beer 1989 ) , dynamical approaches to child development ( Thelen and Smith 1994 ) , and research on the cognitive properties of collectives of agents ( Hutchins 1995 ) , cognition is often taken to be continuous with processes in the environment . [*]
Thus , in seeing cognition as extended one is not merely making a terminological decision ; it makes a significant difference to the methodology of scientific investigation .
In effect , explanatory methods that might once have been thought appropriate only for the analysis of " inner " processes are now being adapted for the study of the outer , and there is promise that our understanding of cognition will become richer for it .
* [[ Philosophical views of a similar spirit can be found in Haugeland 1995 , McClamrock 1985 , Varela et al 1991 , and Wilson 1994 .. ] ]
Some find this sort of externalism unpalatable .
One reason may be that many identify the cognitive with the conscious , and it seems far from plausible that consciousness extends outside the head in these cases .
But not every cognitive process , at least on standard usage , is a conscious process .
It is widely accepted that all sorts of processes beyond the borders of consciousness play a crucial role in cognitive processing : in the retrieval of memories , linguistic processes , and skill acquisition , for example .
So the mere fact that external processes are external where consciousness is internal is no reason to deny that those processes are cognitive .
More interestingly , one might argue that what keeps real cognition processes in the head is the requirement that cognitive processes be portable .
Here , we are moved by a vision of what might be called the Naked Mind : a package of resources and operations we can always bring to bear on a cognitive task , regardless of the local environment .
On this view , the trouble with coupled systems is that they are too easily decoupled .
The true cognitive processes are those that lie at the constant core of the system ; anything else is an add - on extra .
There is something to this objection .
The brain ( or brain and body ) comprises a package of basic , portable , cognitive resources that is of interest in its own right .
These resources may incorporate bodily actions into cognitive processes , as when we use our fingers as working memory in a tricky calculation , but they will not encompass the more contingent aspects of our external environment , such as a pocket calculator .
Still , mere contingency of coupling does not rule out cognitive status .
In the distant future we may be able to plug various modules into our brain to help us out : a module for extra short - term memory when we need it , for example .
When a module is plugged in , the processes involving it are just as cognitive as if they had been there all along . [*]
* [[ Or consider the following passage from a recent science fiction novel ( McHugh 1992 , p. 213 ) : " I am taken to the system 's department where I am attuned to the system .
All I do is jack in and then a technician instructs the system to attune and it does .
I jack out and query the time .
10:52 .
The information pops up .
Always before I could only access information when I was jacked in , it gave me a sense that I knew what I thought and what the system told me , but now , how do I know what is system and what is Zhang ? " ] ]
Even if one were to make the portability criterion pivotal , active externalism would not be undermined .
Counting on our fingers has already been let in the door , for example , and it is easy to push things further .
Think of the old image of the engineer with a slide rule hanging from his belt wherever he goes .
What if people always carried a pocket calculator , or had them implanted ?
The real moral of the portability intuition is that for coupled systems to be relevant to the core of cognition , reliable coupling is required .
It happens that most reliable coupling takes place within the brain , but there can easily be reliable coupling with the environment as well .
If the resources of my calculator or my Filofax are always there when I need them , then they are coupled with me as reliably as we need .
In effect , they are part of the basic package of cognitive resources that I bring to bear on the everyday world .
These systems cannot be impugned simply on the basis of the danger of discrete damage , loss , or malfunction , or because of any occasional decoupling : the biological brain is in similar danger , and occasionally loses capacities temporarily in episodes of sleep , intoxication , and emotion .
If the relevant capacities are generally there when they are required , this is coupling enough .
Moreover , it may be that the biological brain has in fact evolved and matured in ways which factor in the reliable presence of a manipulable external environment .
It certainly seems that evolution has favored on - board capacities which are especially geared to parasitizing the local environment so as to reduce memory load , and even to transform the nature of the computational problems themselves .
Our visual systems have evolved to rely on their environment in various ways : they exploit contingent facts about the structure of natural scenes ( e.g. Ullman and Richards 1984 ) , for example , and they take advantage of the computational shortcuts afforded by bodily motion and locomotion ( e.g. Blake and Yuille , 1992 ) .
Perhaps there are other cases where evolution has found it advantageous to exploit the possibility of the environment being in the cognitive loop .
If so , then external coupling is part of the truly basic package of cognitive resources that we bring to bear on the world .
Language may be an example .
Language appears to be a central means by which cognitive processes are extended into the world .
Think of a group of people brainstorming around a table , or a philosopher who thinks best by writing , developing her ideas as she goes .
It may be that language evolved , in part , to enable such extensions of our cognitive resources within actively coupled systems .
Within the lifetime of an organism , too , individual learning may have molded the brain in ways that rely on cognitive extensions that surrounded us as we learned .
Language is again a central example here , as are the various physical and computational artifacts that are routinely used as cognitive extensions by children in schools and by trainees in numerous professions .
In such cases the brain develops in a way that complements the external structures , and learns to play its role within a unified , densely coupled system .
Once we recognize the crucial role of the environment in constraining the evolution and development of cognition , we see that extended cognition is a core cognitive process , not an add - on extra .
An analogy may be helpful .
The extraordinary efficiency of the fish as a swimming device is partly due , it now seems , to an evolved capacity to couple its swimming behaviors to the pools of external kinetic energy found as swirls , eddies and vortices in its watery environment ( see Triantafyllou and G. Triantafyllou 1995 ) .
These vortices include both naturally occurring ones ( e.g. , where water hits a rock ) and self - induced ones ( created by well - timed tail flaps ) .
The fish swims by building these externally occurring processes into the very heart of its locomotion routines .
The fish and surrounding vortices together constitute a unified and remarkably efficient swimming machine .
Now consider a reliable feature of the human environment , such as the sea of words .
This linguistic surround envelopes us from birth .
Under such conditions , the plastic human brain will surely come to treat such structures as a reliable resource to be factored into the shaping of on - board cognitive routines .
Where the fish flaps its tail to set up the eddies and vortices it subsequently exploits , we intervene in multiple linguistic media , creating local structures and disturbances whose reliable presence drives our ongoing internal processes .
Words and external symbols are thus paramount among the cognitive vortices which help constitute human thought .
4 From Cognition to Mind
So far we have spoken largely about " cognitive processing " , and argued for its extension into the environment .
Some might think that the conclusion has been bought too cheaply .
Perhaps some processing takes place in the environment , but what of mind ?
Everything we have said so far is compatible with the view that truly mental states - experiences , beliefs , desires , emotions , and so on - are all determined by states of the brain .
Perhaps what is truly mental is internal , after all ?
We propose to take things a step further .
While some mental states , such as experiences , may be determined internally , there are other cases in which external factors make a significant contribution .
In particular , we will argue that beliefs can be constituted partly by features of the environment , when those features play the right sort of role in driving cognitive processes .
If so , the mind extends into the world .
First , consider a normal case of belief embedded in memory .
Inga hears from a friend that there is an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art , and decides to go see it .
She thinks for a moment and recalls that the museum is on 53rd Street , so she walks to 53rd Street and goes into the museum .
It seems clear that Inga believes that the museum is on 53rd Street , and that she believed this even before she consulted her memory .
It was not previously an occurrent belief , but then neither are most of our beliefs .
The belief was sitting somewhere in memory , waiting to be accessed .
Now consider Otto .
Otto suffers from Alzheimer 's disease , and like many Alzheimer 's patients , he relies on information in the environment to help structure his life .
Otto carries a notebook around with him everywhere he goes .
When he learns new information , he writes it down .
When he needs some old information , he looks it up .
For Otto , his notebook plays the role usually played by a biological memory .
Today , Otto hears about the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art , and decides to go see it .
He consults the notebook , which says that the museum is on 53rd Street , so he walks to 53rd Street and goes into the museum .
Clearly , Otto walked to 53rd Street because he wanted to go to the museum and he believed the museum was on 53rd Street .
And just as Inga had her belief even before she consulted her memory , it seems reasonable to say that Otto believed the museum was on 53rd Street even before consulting his notebook .
For in relevant respects the cases are entirely analogous : the notebook plays for Otto the same role that memory plays for Inga .
The information in the notebook functions just like the information constituting an ordinary non-occurrent belief ; it just happens that this information lies beyond the skin .
The alternative is to say that Otto has no belief about the matter until he consults his notebook ; at best , he believes that the museum is located at the address in the notebook .
But if we follow Otto around for a while , we will see how unnatural this way of speaking is .
Otto is constantly using his notebook as a matter of course .
It is central to his actions in all sorts of contexts , in the way that an ordinary memory is central in an ordinary life .
The same information might come up again and again , perhaps being slightly modified on occasion , before retreating into the recesses of his artificial memory .
To say that the beliefs disappear when the notebook is filed away seems to miss the big picture in just the same way as saying that Inga 's beliefs disappear as soon as she is no longer conscious of them .
In both cases the information is reliably there when needed , available to consciousness and available to guide action , in just the way that we expect a belief to be .
Certainly , insofar as beliefs and desires are characterized by their explanatory roles , Otto 's and Inga 's cases seem to be on a par : the essential causal dynamics of the two cases mirror each other precisely .
We are happy to explain Inga 's action in terms of her occurrent desire to go to the museum and her standing belief that the museum is on 53rd street , and we should be happy to explain Otto 's action in the same way .
The alternative is to explain Otto 's action in terms of his occurrent desire to go to the museum , his standing belief that the Museum is on the location written in the notebook , and the accessible fact that the notebook says the Museum is on 53rd Street ; but this complicates the explanation unnecessarily .
If we must resort to explaining Otto 's action this way , then we must also do so for the countless other actions in which his notebook is involved ; in each of the explanations , there will be an extra term involving the notebook .
We submit that to explain things this way is to take one step too many .
It is pointlessly complex , in the same way that it would be pointlessly complex to explain Inga 's actions in terms of beliefs about her memory .
The notebook is a constant for Otto , in the same way that memory is a constant for Inga ; to point to it in every belief / desire explanation would be redundant .
In an explanation , simplicity is power .
If this is right , we can even construct the case of Twin Otto , who is just like Otto except that a while ago he mistakenly wrote in his notebook that the Museum of Modern Art was on 51st Street .
Today , Twin Otto is a physical duplicate of Otto from the skin in , but his notebook differs .
Consequently , Twin Otto is best characterized as believing that the museum is on 51st Street , where Otto believes it is on 53rd .
In these cases , a belief is simply not in the head .
This mirrors the conclusion of Putnam and Burge , but again there are important differences .
In the Putnam / Burge cases , the external features constituting differences in belief are distal and historical , so that twins in these cases produce physically indistinguishable behavior .
In the cases we are describing , the relevant external features play an active role in the here - and - now , and have a direct impact on behavior .
Where Otto walks to 53rd Street , Twin Otto walks to 51st .
There is no question of explanatory irrelevance for this sort of external belief content ; it is introduced precisely because of the central explanatory role that it plays .
Like the Putnam and Burge cases , these cases involve differences in reference and truth - conditions , but they also involve differences in the dynamics of cognition . [*]
* [[ In the terminology of Chalmers ' " The Components of Content " ( forthcoming ) : the twins in the Putnam and Burge cases differ only in their relational content , but Otto and his twin can be seen to differ in their notional content , which is the sort of content that governs cognition .
Notional content is generally internal to a cognitive system , but in this case the cognitive system is itself effectively extended to include the notebook . ]]
The moral is that when it comes to belief , there is nothing sacred about skull and skin .
What makes some information count as a belief is the role it plays , and there is no reason why the relevant role can be played only from inside the body .
Some will resist this conclusion .
An opponent might put her foot down and insist that as she uses the term " belief " , or perhaps even according to standard usage , Otto simply does not qualify as believing that the museum is on 53rd Street .
We do not intend to debate what is standard usage ; our broader point is that the notion of belief ought to be used so that Otto qualifies as having the belief in question .
In all important respects , Otto 's case is similar to a standard case of ( non-occurrent ) belief .
The differences between Otto 's case and Inga's are striking , but they are superficial .
By using the " belief " notion in a wider way , it picks out something more akin to a natural kind .
The notion becomes deeper and more unified , and is more useful in explanation .
To provide substantial resistance , an opponent has to show that Otto 's and Inga 's cases differ in some important and relevant respect .
But in what deep respect are the cases different ?
To make the case solely on the grounds that information is in the head in one case but not in the other would be to beg the question .
If this difference is relevant to a difference in belief , it is surely not primitively relevant .
To justify the different treatment , we must find some more basic underlying difference between the two .
It might be suggested that the cases are relevantly different in that Inga has more reliable access to the information .
After all , someone might take away Otto 's notebook at any time , but Inga 's memory is safer .
It is not implausible that constancy is relevant : indeed , the fact that Otto always uses his notebook played some role in our justifying its cognitive status .
If Otto were consulting a guidebook as a one - off , we would be much less likely to ascribe him a standing belief .
But in the original case , Otto 's access to the notebook is very reliable - not perfectly reliable , to be sure , but then neither is Inga 's access to her memory .
A surgeon might tamper with her brain , or more mundanely , she might have too much to drink .
The mere possibility of such tampering is not enough to deny her the belief .
One might worry that Otto 's access to his notebook in fact comes and goes .
He showers without the notebook , for example , and he cannot read it when it is dark .
Surely his belief cannot come and go so easily ?
We could get around this problem by redescribing the situation , but in any case an occasional temporary disconnection does not threaten our claim .
After all , when Inga is asleep , or when she is intoxicated , we do not say that her belief disappears .
What really counts is that the information is easily available when the subject needs it , and this constraint is satisfied equally in the two cases .
If Otto 's notebook were often unavailable to him at times when the information in it would be useful , there might be a problem , as the information would not be able to play the action - guiding role that is central to belief ; but if it is easily available in most relevant situations , the belief is not endangered .
Perhaps a difference is that Inga has better access to the information than Otto does ?
Inga's " central " processes and her memory probably have a relatively high - bandwidth link between them , compared to the low - grade connection between Otto and his notebook .
But this alone does not make a difference between believing and not believing .
Consider Inga 's museum - going friend Lucy , whose biological memory has only a low - grade link to her central systems , due to nonstandard biology or past misadventures .
Processing in Lucy 's case might be less efficient , but as long as the relevant information is accessible , Lucy clearly believes that the museum is on 53rd Street .
If the connection was too indirect - if Lucy had to struggle hard to retrieve the information with mixed results , or a psychotherapist 's aid were needed - we might become more reluctant to ascribe the belief , but such cases are well beyond Otto 's situation , in which the information is easily accessible .
Another suggestion could be that Otto has access to the relevant information only by perception , whereas Inga has more direct access -- by introspection , perhaps .
In some ways , however , to put things this way is to beg the question .
After all , we are in effect advocating a point of view on which Otto 's internal processes and his notebook constitute a single cognitive system .
From the standpoint of this system , the flow of information between notebook and brain is not perceptual at all ; it does not involve the impact of something outside the system .
It is more akin to information flow within the brain .
The only deep way in which the access is perceptual is that in Otto 's case , there is a distinctly perceptual phenomenology associated with the retrieval of the information , whereas in Inga 's case there is not .
But why should the nature of an associated phenomenology make a difference to the status of a belief ?
Inga 's memory may have some associated phenomenology , but it is still a belief .
The phenomenology is not visual , to be sure .
But for visual phenomenology consider the Terminator , from the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie of the same name .
When he recalls some information from memory , it is " displayed " before him in his visual field ( presumably he is conscious of it , as there are frequent shots depicting his point of view ) .
The fact that standing memories are recalled in this unusual way surely makes little difference to their status as standing beliefs .
These various small differences between Otto's and Inga 's cases are all shallow differences .
To focus on them would be to miss the way in which for Otto , notebook entries play just the sort of role that beliefs play in guiding most people 's lives .
Perhaps the intuition that Otto's is not a true belief comes from a residual feeling that the only true beliefs are occurrent beliefs .
If we take this feeling seriously , Inga 's belief will be ruled out too , as will many beliefs that we attribute in everyday life .
This would be an extreme view , but it may be the most consistent way to deny Otto 's belief .
Upon even a slightly less extreme view - the view that a belief must be available for consciousness , for example - Otto 's notebook entry seems to qualify just as well as Inga 's memory .
Once dispositional beliefs are let in the door , it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Otto 's notebook has all the relevant dispositions .
5 Beyond the Outer Limits
If the thesis is accepted , how far should we go ?
All sorts of puzzle cases spring to mind .
What of the amnesic villagers in 100 Years of Solitude , who forget the names for everything and so hang labels everywhere ?
Does the information in my Filofax count as part of my memory ?
If Otto 's notebook has been tampered with , does he believe the newly - installed information ?
Do I believe the contents of the page in front of me before I read it ?
Is my cognitive state somehow spread across the Internet ?
We do not think that there are categorical answers to all of these questions , and we will not give them .
But to help understand what is involved in ascriptions of extended belief , we can at least examine the features of our central case that make the notion so clearly applicable there .
First , the notebook is a constant in Otto 's life - in cases where the information in the notebook would be relevant , he will rarely take action without consulting it .
Second , the information in the notebook is directly available without difficulty .
Third , upon retrieving information from the notebook he automatically endorses it .
Fourth , the information in the notebook has been consciously endorsed at some point in the past , and indeed is there as a consequence of this endorsement . [*]
The status of the fourth feature as a criterion for belief is arguable ( perhaps one can acquire beliefs through subliminal perception , or through memory tampering ? ) , but the first three features certainly play a crucial role .
* [[ The constancy and past - endorsement criteria may suggest that history is partly constitutive of belief .
One might react to this by removing any historical component ( giving a purely dispositional reading of the constancy criterion and eliminating the past - endorsement criterion , for example ) , or one might allow such a component as long as the main burden is carried by features of the present . ]]
Insofar as increasingly exotic puzzle cases lack these features , the applicability of the notion of " belief " gradually falls off .
If I rarely take relevant action without consulting my Filofax , for example , its status within my cognitive system will resemble that of the notebook in Otto's .
But if I often act without consultation - for example , if I sometimes answer relevant questions with " I do n't know " - then information in it counts less clearly as part of my belief system .
The Internet is likely to fail on multiple counts , unless I am unusually computer - reliant , facile with the technology , and trusting , but information in certain files on my computer may qualify .
In intermediate cases , the question of whether a belief is present may be indeterminate , or the answer may depend on the varying standards that are at play in various contexts in which the question might be asked .
But any indeterminacy here does not mean that in the central cases , the answer is not clear .
What about socially extended cognition ?
Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of other thinkers ?
We see no reason why not , in principle .
In an unusually interdependent couple , it is entirely possible that one partner 's beliefs will play the same sort of role for the other as the notebook plays for Otto . [*]
What is central is a high degree of trust , reliance , and accessibility .
In other social relationships these criteria may not be so clearly fulfilled , but they might nevertheless be fulfilled in specific domains .
For example , the waiter at my favorite restaurant might act as a repository of my beliefs about my favorite meals ( this might even be construed as a case of extended desire ) .
In other cases , one 's beliefs might be embodied in one 's secretary , one 's accountant , or one 's collaborator . [*]
* [[ From the New York Times , March 30 , 1995 , p. B7 , in an article on former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden : " Wooden and his wife attended 36 straight Final Fours , and she invariably served as his memory bank .
Nell Wooden rarely forgot a name - her husband rarely remembered one - and in the standing - room - only Final Four lobbies , she would recognize people for him . " ] ]
* [[ Might this sort of reasoning also allow something like Burge 's extended " arthritis " beliefs ?
After all , I might always defer to my doctor in taking relevant actions concerning my disease .
Perhaps so , but there are some clear differences .
For example , any extended beliefs would be grounded in an existing active relationship with the doctor , rather than in a historical relationship to a language community .
And on the current analysis , my deference to the doctor would tend to yield something like a true belief that I have some other disease in my thigh , rather than the false belief that I have arthritis there .
On the other hand , if I used medical experts solely as terminological consultants , the results of Burge 's analysis might be mirrored . ]]
In each of these cases , the major burden of the coupling between agents is carried by language .
Without language , we might be much more akin to discrete Cartesian " inner " minds , in which high - level cognition relies largely on internal resources .
But the advent of language has allowed us to spread this burden into the world .
Language , thus construed , is not a mirror of our inner states but a complement to them .
It serves as a tool whose role is to extend cognition in ways that on - board devices cannot .
Indeed , it may be that the intellectual explosion in recent evolutionary time is due as much to this linguistically - enabled extension of cognition as to any independent development in our inner cognitive resources .
What , finally , of the self ?
Does the extended mind imply an extended self ?
It seems so .
Most of us already accept that the self outstrips the boundaries of consciousness ; my dispositional beliefs , for example , constitute in some deep sense part of who I am .
If so , then these boundaries may also fall beyond the skin .
The information in Otto 's notebook , for example , is a central part of his identity as a cognitive agent .
What this comes to is that Otto himself is best regarded as an extended system , a coupling of biological organism and external resources .
To consistently resist this conclusion , we would have to shrink the self into a mere bundle of occurrent states , severely threatening its deep psychological continuity .
Far better to take the broader view , and see agents themselves as spread into the world .
As with any reconception of ourselves , this view will have significant consequences .
There are obvious consequences for philosophical views of the mind and for the methodology of research in cognitive science , but there will also be effects in the moral and social domains .
It may be , for example , that in some cases interfering with someone 's environment will have the same moral significance as interfering with their person .
And if the view is taken seriously , certain forms of social activity might be reconceived as less akin to communication and action , and as more akin to thought .
In any case , once the hegemony of skin and skull is usurped , we may be able to see ourselves more truly as creatures of the world .

They knew : Bush , Cheney authorized ' harsh interrogations '
RAW STORY

WASHINGTON  President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney both signed off on using harsh interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists after asking the Justice Department to endorse their legality , news agencies have learned .
The Associated Press reported earlier that senior Bush administration officials took care to insulate President Bush from a series of meetings where CIA interrogation methods , including waterboarding , which simulates drowning , were discussed and ultimately approved .
However , ABC News is now reporting that President Bush himself was aware of the discussions and approved the controversial interrogation tactics himself .
" Well , we started to connect the dots , in order to protect the American people . "
Bush told ABC News .
" And , yes , I 'm aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . "
A former senior U.S. intelligence official familiar with the meetings described them Thursday to the AP to confirm details first reported by ABC News on Wednesday .
The intelligence official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue .
Between 2002 and 2003 , the Justice Department issued several memos from its Office of Legal Counsel that justified using the interrogation tactics , including ones that critics call torture .
" If you looked at the timing of the meetings and the memos you 'd see a correlation , " the former intelligence official said .
Those who attended the dozens of meetings agreed that " there 'd need to be a legal opinion on the legality of these tactics " before using them on al - Qaida detainees , the former official said .
The meetings were held in the White House Situation Room in the years immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks .
Attending the sessions were Cheney , then - Bush aides Attorney General John Ashcroft , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice .
The White House , Justice and State departments and the CIA refused comment Thursday , as did a spokesman for Tenet .
A message for Ashcroft was not immediately returned .
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D - Mass. , lambasted what he described as " yet another astonishing disclosure about the Bush administration and its use of torture . "
" Who would have thought that in the United States of America in the 21st century , the top officials of the executive branch would routinely gather in the White House to approve torture ? "
Kennedy said in a statement .
" Long after President Bush has left office , our country will continue to pay the price for his administration 's renegade repudiation of the rule of law and fundamental human rights . "
The American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress to investigate .
" With each new revelation , it is beginning to look like the torture operation was managed and directed out of the White House , " ACLU legislative director Caroline Fredrickson said .
" This is what we suspected all along . "
The former intelligence official described Cheney and the top national security officials as deeply immersed in developing the CIA 's interrogation program during months of discussions over which methods should be used and when .
At times , CIA officers would demonstrate some of the tactics , or at least detail how they worked , to make sure the small group of " principals " fully understood what the al - Qaida detainees would undergo .
The principals eventually authorized physical abuse such as slaps and pushes , sleep deprivation , or waterboarding .
This technique involves strapping a person down and pouring water over his cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
The small group then asked the Justice Department to examine whether using the interrogation methods would break domestic or international laws .
" No one at the agency wanted to operate under a notion of winks and nods and assumptions that everyone understood what was being talked about , " said a second former senior intelligence official .
" People wanted to be assured that everything that was conducted was understood and approved by the folks in the chain of command . "
The Office of Legal Counsel issued at least two opinions on interrogation methods .
In one , dated Aug. 1 , 2002 , then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee defined torture as covering " only extreme acts " causing pain similar in intensity to that caused by death or organ failure .
A second , dated March 14 , 2003 , justified using harsh tactics on detainees held overseas so long as military interrogators did not specifically intend to torture their captives .
Both legal opinions since have been withdrawn .
The second former senior intelligence official said rescinding the memos caused the CIA to seek even more detailed approvals for the interrogations .
The department issued another still - secret memo in October 2001 that , in part , sought to outline novel ways the military could be used domestically to defend the country in the face of an impending attack .
The Justice Department so far has refused to release it , citing attorney - client privilege , and Attorney General Michael Mukasey declined to describe it Thursday at a Senate panel where Democrats characterized it as a " torture memo . "
Not all of the principals who attended were fully comfortable with the White House meetings .
The ABC News report portrayed Ashcroft as troubled by the discussions , despite agreeing that the interrogations methods were legal .
" Why are we talking about this in the White House ? " the network quoted Ashcroft as saying during one meeting .
" History will not judge this kindly . "

But we ’re beyond tribalism , right ?
Wrong .
The main forces in the world today are the modernizing , barrier - breaking sweep of globalization and the tribal reaction to it , which lies in the assertion of religious , national , linguistic , racial or ethnic identity against the unifying technological tide .

Connection and fragmentation vie .
The Internet opens worlds and minds , but also offers opinions to reinforce every prejudice .
You ’re never alone out there ; some idiot will always back you .
The online world does n’t dissolve tribes .
It gives them global reach .
Jihadism , with its mirage of a restored infidel - free Caliphate , is perhaps the most violent tribal reaction to modernity .
But fundamentalism is no Islamic preserve ; it has its Christian , Jewish , Hindu and other expressions .
America ’s peaceful tribes are also out in force .
As Obama and Hillary Clinton engage in the long war for the Democratic nomination , we have the black vote , and the Latino vote , and the women - over - 50 vote , and the Volvo - driving liberal - intellectual vote , and the white blue - collar vote , and the urban vote , and the rural vote , and the under - 30s vote  sub - groups with shared social , cultural , linguistic or other traits and interests .
That ’s democracy at work .
Sure .
But the United States is divided , within itself and from the world , in growing ways .
It is divided by war , by income chasms , by foreclosures , by political polarization and by culture wars .
Increasingly it is looked upon from outside with dismay or alarm .
Healing , within and without , will be a central task of the next president .

What You Should Know about Mobile Cell Phone Jammer Usage
Cell phones have truly been increasing in popularity year after year for decades now .
One study even shows that well over 200 million people within the US alone had cellular service in October of 2005 but that number has exponentially increased in the many years that have since passed .
They are even more ubiquitous throughout Europe .
Being able to contact anyone whenever the need to do so arises is a convenience that many people can easily take for granted .
However , there is a dark side to mobile phones that many business owners have had to experience firsthand the hard way .
The Dark Side of Cell Phones
Mobiles are great communication tools that are effective and efficient in many ways , but there are still people that use these devices at the most inconvenient times .
Within a wide range of different public places ( theaters , restaurants , concerts , funeral parlors , churches ) , people simply do not know when to put their mobile phones away .
It can be socially unacceptable for others , who are frustrated by these individuals that decide to do whatever they want , even in situations with clearly marked signs prohibiting cellular use .
Even more sinister uses include using the cell phone as a detonation device , hence the creation of our IED jammer category , to protect and prevent the loss of life .
There is a way to safely eliminate these problems immediately , by using a cell phone jammer .
Learning how signal jamming works on wireless devices will make it possible to clearly understand and appreciate their overall value .
Basics Of The Cell Phone Blocker
Being able to successfully disrupt a cell phone signal is basically the same as being able to jam any other type of mobile radio communication with a standard signal blocker .
Keep in mind that a wireless device is able to function by communicating directly with its designated service network through a base station or tower .
These towers divide cities into cells or smaller areas .
As a mobile cellphone user drives down the street , the signal is passed like a football between towers along the way .
A cell phone disruptor is able to successfully transmit through the same exact radio frequencies that are being used as these wireless devices .
This ' white noise ' effectively disrupts the communication that is flowing between the base station that is located within the tower and the handset .
This is what is referred to technically by the term “ denial - of - service ” .
The cell phone jammer kit is specifically designed to cancel out ( deny ) a signal within the radio spectrum to the handsets that exist within the range of the jamming device .
How Mobile Jammers Get the Job Done
Cell phone blockers have been designed to completely overpower the mobile device by transmitting a standard signal through the same exact frequency , as mentioned earlier .
However , the key is to make sure that it achieves this with a considerable amount of power where the two signals successfully collide and even cancel one another out completely causing a disruption of services .
In basic layman terms , the cell phone is actually tricked into believing that there is not a service available in the area .
Therefore , when people try to use their phones within an area that has been jammed , it will appear as if they are simply in a “ dead zone ” without service .
How Can This GSM Blockage Be Accomplished ?
Although different cellular systems process a wide range of different signals , all networks use basic radio signals in a way where they can easily become interrupted .
GSM 2 , the system that is used within digital cellular as well as systems that are based on a foundation of PCS , operate within the 900 - MHz as well as 1800 MHz bands located either in Asia or Europe as well as the 1900 MHz band in North America .
The scrambler devices are able to successfully broadcast any type of frequency that is effective against CDMA , AMPS , GSM , TDMA , DCS , PCS , Nextel and even iDEN systems .
' Old - fashioned ' analog mobiles , as well as today ’s digital devices are susceptible to jamming .
What is the Average Effective Jamming Range ?
That specifically depends on the unit power and local environment and signal strength .
To a small degree , this can also include such things as walls within a building that are able to slightly diminish the signal that is being transmitted by the phone blocker .
Low - powered mobile blockers are able to stop all calls within a range of about 60 feet , and higher powered models can create a “ dead zone ” the size of a football field .
The Most Powerful Devices on the Market
However , keep in mind that such powerful units are used by law enforcement officials , and agencies , with units capable of a much larger dead zone .
Some government models are capable of creating dead zones that extend for much farther than a one Km radius from the jamming device .
NASA 's New Radiation Shielding First Proposed By John W. Campbell In 1936
NASA engineers are working on a clever new idea for shielding astronauts from cosmic rays .
If you put the tanks containing the fuel and water needed for the journey on the outside of the living space , they can be used for shielding .
Just like science fiction writer John W. Campbell first proposed in 1936 .
Richard Wilkins , director of NASA 's Center for Applied Radiation Research at Prairie View A & M University in Texas has conducted a study into liquid shield approaches .
As he puts it
" In most [ mission ] scenarios , you need liquid hydrogen for fuel and you need water .
And these are all considered materials that are particularly good for cosmic ray shielding . "
The tests demonstrate that the atoms of liquid hydrogen provide an excellent screen against cosmic rays ; they do n't fragment into secondary particles like heavier elements ( as would be the case with lead shielding ) .
And the radiation from secondary particles can be just as harmful .
In 1936 , the protagonists of John W. Campbell 's The Ultimate Weapon found themselves in need of good shielding from blasts of radiation :
" You mean they bathed that ship in neutrons ? "
" Shot it full of 'em .
Just like our proton guns , only sending neutrons . "
" Well , why were n't we killed too ? "
" Water stops neutrons , " Kendall said .
" Figure it out . "
" The rocket - water tanks - all around us ... that saved us ? "

This other problem is actually related to reading some of the conditions of the Iditarod which started this week .
Because of the changes in snow patterns there are parts of the course that have almost no snow
Yesterday I was discussing some of the political problems that are likely to make gas and oil supplies an ongoing news story for a few years yet .
There is , however , also a potentially growing physical problem that might also impact the logistics of supply somewhat faster than we might think .
Winds have been howling in the Alaska Range , and temperatures have dipped as low as 40 degrees below zero .
Runners in the Iditarod Invitational have been holed up for days at Rainy Pass Lodge at Puntilla Lake , waiting for the weather to break .
Stanley , who flew to Rainy Pass Lodge on Thursday , said it was impossible to check conditions in the pass because a raging ground blizzard smothered everything in white for about 200 feet above the ground .
The National Weather Service is forecasting that the winds will die down as the Iditarod rolls north , but there is no substantial snow in the forecast .
The basic mechanics of ice roads have been known for decades .
As a laden truck moves over ice , it creates a shallow depression all around it — a sort of bowl in the ice , several inches deep and many yards across .
The greater the speed , the deeper the depression .
Above a critical velocity that varies with local conditions , a truck can damage the roadbed so severely that the next vehicle to come along will break through the ice .
For this reason , the top speed on the Tibbitt to Contwoyto route is usually about 22 mph .
In some stretches , as on Waite Lake , the maximum is just a few miles per hour .
Last winter , one of the warmest on record , the road opened late and melted early , stranding tons of needed supplies .
Mining companies spent $ 100 million trying to airlift the cargo .
Diavik cut a 500 - ton excavating shovel into pieces and rented the world 's largest helicopter from Russia to lift the pieces to its mine site .
This is not because it is warmer out there - Lack of snow , or in many cases a shorter frozen season can have a significant impact on the logistics of operations up in the Far North .
And here the problems of global warming are likely to have an effect .
There is a story in February ’s Popular Mechanics about the problems of supplying the North - West Territories of Canada , where the main supply road , some 370 miles runs up the lakes from Yellowknife to the Tahera Diamond Mine .
It can only be built after the ice gets to be about a foot thick , since it is planed and graded using heavy equipment , and then , after the ice gets to be 40 inches thick it can carry 70 - ton trucks .
Last year that did not happen until March , and because the mechanics of the ice road limit speed , it reduces the volume of supplies that can be sent .
When the road cannot carry them then , as the Washington Post noted This year , however , the road opened earlier – on January 28th , and so supplies are more assured .
Yet this potential shortening of the season , and the difficulties in establishing the supply roads to rigs as well as mines , are likely to add to costs , particularly in localities , such as Eastern Siberia , where the major arteries are not well established , and must be driven over permafrost .
As permafrost warms it loses this bearing capacity with a lowering of the ground strength by up to 70 % .
( Note - I added the black trend line on the right just as a guide to illustrate the point )
Now if we recognize that the world is getting warmer , and look at the curve about the English Mean Temperature for the past 200 years ( Parker , D.E. , T.P. Legg , and C.K. Folland .
1992 .
A new daily Central England Temperature Series , 1772 - 1991 .
Int. J. Clim. , Vol 12 , p317-342 ) one sees that the temperature has been following a steady rise since about 1880 , except for that drop - off that started in 1940 , and which we also see in the temperatures of the Central US .
So it seems reasonable to assume that the Arctic will get warmer in the short term , and so we should go back to the beginning of the Medieval Warming Period .
At present , in Greenland it is , for example , not possible for wheat to grow .
Reading the Last Viking one can find out about the times of Eric the Red and the arrival of the Vikings and he takes us to the records of Ivar Bardson , who wrote
" On the mountains and lower down grow the best of fruits , as big as apples and good to eat .
There also grows the best wheat that exists . "
.
I recognize that this differs from the history given of Greenland by Jared Diamond in Collapse but bear in mind that when he was quoting contemporary writers he was more focused the time that the Greenland society collapsed .
For example in History of America before Columbus they write of orchards , and quote Bardson .
Although Bardson was writing towards the end of the 350 years of the Greenland Settlement and and some 150 years after the temperatures had started to fall
It is interesting , for those of us just naturally curious , to read the second part of the Last Viking since it includes a description of sea water freezing and creating what was known as “ sea - lung . ”
It is also interesting to see , from his maps and aerial photo , where the Vikings went in their boats , relative to the current ice between the islands of North - East Canada .
The other curiously interesting thing I found was this passage from Professor Mandia ’s writing .
Lamb ( 1995 ) describes a passage from Landnámabók , a book written in Iceland in the year 1125 , that catalogs the settlement of Iceland .
It was recorded that Thorkel Farserk , a cousin of Erik the Red who founded the colony , having no boat at hand , swam out across a fiord to fetch a sheep from the island of Hvalsey .
The distance was over two miles .
Lamb ( 1995 ) cites a medical endurance expert who established 10 oC ( 50 oF ) as the coolest possible water temperature for a very strong man to survive swimming that distance .
Given that the normal water temperature at present for that fiord in August is 6 oF , the story suggests a much warmer climate than present .
Lamb ( 1995 ) and Tkachuck ( 1983 ) both refer to old Norse burial depths being much greater in the past than today which suggests the permafrost was deeper ( warmer climate ) than at present .
Well this is all interesting stuff ( it ’s what happens when you follow a Google trail ) , but has taken me a fair way from where I wanted to go , which was essentially to inject a little concern that the warming of the permafrost is likely to have significant impact on the difficulties in developing the resources of the Eastern Siberian region , and may cause further delay , and increasing costs for those operations , at a time when their more rapid development may well , in light of European and American needs , be more helpful .
Changes in the permafrost , the behavior of the ice - pack and ice floes , and the possible re-opening of the Northwest Passage , which Viking ruins suggest occurred back in those days , will all both allow greater access to possible resources and potentially significantly increase the difficulty and cost in extracting those resources .
When one puts these physical problems in with the political problems that I discussed yesterday , somehow I am not as confident of timely future supplies as others might be .
UPDATE : I am grateful to Nick Rouse who drew my attention to the National Research Council Report Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years which discusses the Medieval Warming period and the Little Ice Age , and with diffidence let me quote from page 78
For central Greenland ( Cuffey et al. 1995 , Cuffey and Clow 1997 , Dahl - Jensen et al. 1998 ) , results show a warming over the last 150 years of approximately 1 °C ± 0.2 °C preceded by a few centuries of cool conditions .
Preceding this was a warm period centered around A.D. 1000 , which was warmer than the late 20th century by approximately 1°C .
An analysis for south - central Greenland ( Dahl - Jensen et al. 1998 ) shows the same pattern of warming and cooling , but with larger magnitude changes .
A borehole from Law Dome ( Dahl - Jensen et al. 1999 ) , in coastal East Antarctica , reveals a warming of approximately 0.7 °C from the middle 19th century to present ( uncertainty of approximately 0.2 °C ) .
This was preceded by a period of comparable warmth centered on 1500 – 1600 , a 1 °C cooler period centered on 1300 , and consistently warmer conditions prior to this ( with temperature at A.D. 1 being approximately 1 °C warmer than late 20th century ) .
There is no apparent warming during medieval times at this site .
While there is not that much evidence to show that this was a global event ( which requires matching temperatures , I suppose , in the Southern Hemisphere ) , there is the odd bit of evidence that the Roman Warming Period might have been global ( ibid ) The relevant references are : Cuffey , K.M. , G.D.

If you want to know what the cult movie breakout of the season will be , look no further than Zombie Strippers .
Created by brother - sister team Jay and Angela Lee , the movie is a mashup of awesome zombie gore , pneumatic boobie action , and postmodern feminist theory that would make the hair walk off Judith Butler 's head .
Opening in U.S. theaters tomorrow , Zombie Strippers is going to live forever in the annals of freaky - ass movie lore .
The plot is simple and to - the - point .
President George W. Bush , with new VP Arnold Schwarzenegger , has just been " reelected " a fourth time due to the wonders of electronic voting machines .
All forms of public nudity ( including in strip clubs ) have been made illegal .
The war still rages in Iraq .
And scientists at the evil W Corporation have created a zombie virus to give to dead soldiers so that they can keep fighting even after being killed .
Sort of a futuristic stop - loss situation .
With zombies .

Inevitably , the zombie virus escapes the lab via an infected dude , with the Z Squad in hot pursuit .
Of course the dude winds up in a strip club ( whose owner is played by Robert " Freddie " Englund ) .
He promptly proceeds to zombie out after biting Kat ( Jenna Jameson ) , the star stripper .
For some reason , her superpowered , rotting - flesh style of zombie stripping makes the guys go crazy !
They just love all those veins in her boobies and her bloody teeth .
So the other strippers start asking Kat to zombie them out too , so they can compete for tips .
Pretty soon , after about twenty zillion zombie stripping scenes that get weirder and more fucked up as the movie progresses , you 've got a whole passel of zombie strippers who have to eat men every night .
The men they pick from the audience imagine they 're about to get some special attention — until they find out what it 's like to get their dicks , tongues , brains , and guts gnawed out by apeshit zombie strippers hopped up on Nietzschean goofballs .

Inspired by classic existentialist play Rhinoceros by Eugene Ionesco , the flick is larded with references to philosophy ( it takes place in Sartre , Nebraska ) and surreal speeches which combine direct quotes from Nietzsche with Juno - style smartpatter .
" It 's not about a sense of self but of regression to the mean ! " cries one about - to - be - zombified stripper , who then adds , " But it 's so fucking cool ! "
The special effects are great , the mood is pure fucked - up , and there is ( of course ) a zombie stripper showdown involving pool balls where Jameson commendably allows her naked body to look truly disgusting .
After about an hour of watching the same dark sets in the strip club , you really do get the feeling that you 're watching one of those claustrophobic existentialist plays where everyone is in hell screaming " I HATE YOU " to their own reflections in mirrors .

This movie is like some kind eruption from the dark heart of pop culture and intellectual culture at once , a meditation on female sexual conformity that nevertheless shoves boobies in our faces .
But rotted boobies !
That kill you !
Are we supposed to enjoy the stripping or be grossed out by it ?
Are these just regular old cool zombies , or do they represent the disease of submission in political life ?
All I have to say is : Damn that tongue - eating scene was great !
And I do n't think my life will be complete until poststructuralist feminist film theorist Kaja Silverman has explained this movie to me — or , if not me , at least someone .

Another US strike inside Pakistan ’s border region
By Peter Symonds
19 March 2008
An air strike on Sunday on a compound in the Pakistani tribal area of South Waziristan that borders Afghanistan has left up to 20 people dead .
While Washington has not acknowledged responsibility , there is little doubt that the US military or the CIA carried out the attack as part of a widening covert war against anti-American militants entrenched in the Pakistani border areas .
Up to seven missiles or bombs flattened the compound just south of the regional centre of Wana at around 3 p.m .
“ When I heard the explosions , I rushed to the place where it happened .
I saw dead bodies scattered everywhere , ” a villager Aziz Ullah Wazir told the Washington Post .
Local residents and officials claimed that the house belonged to a Taliban sympathiser , Noorullah Wazir , and was frequented by “ Arabs ” — the term used to denote foreign supporters of the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Veteran journalist Sailab Masood told the Guardian , however , that local tribesmen were angry that innocent civilians had been killed .
Details of the attack are scanty .
According to the New York Times , villagers said a B - 52 bomber carried out the raid .
Other reports cite locals who claim to have heard the sound of a US Predator drone — an unmanned surveillance vehicle that has been used in previous attacks inside Pakistan .
The Pakistani military acknowledged that the blasts had occurred , but pointedly refused to identify the attackers , saying only that the army had no operations in the area .
Both Washington and Islamabad are deliberately playing down the attack , which will only further fuel anger at Pakistan ’s support for the US - led occupation of Afghanistan .
President Pervez Musharraf ’s involvement in the Bush administration ’s bogus “ war on terrorism ” and tacit approval of US operations inside Pakistan were a major factor in generating opposition to his regime .
The issue remains highly sensitive as the winners of last month ’s elections — the Pakistan People ’s Party ( PPP ) and the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) — prepare to form a government .
Whatever their limited criticisms of US militarism during the campaign , both parties have a long record of supporting Pakistan ’s alliance with Washington and collaborating with the US military .
Significantly , neither party has protested against the latest missile strike , an indication that the new government , like Musharraf , will acquiesce to US strikes in the tribal areas .
There are many signs that the Bush administration has expanded covert operations inside Pakistan since the beginning of the year .
In early January , the New York Times reported that a top - level White House meeting , involving Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and other senior officials , discussed in detail “ far more aggressive covert operations ” inside Pakistani border areas .
“ The new operations for expanded covert operations include loosening restrictions on the CIA to strike selected targets in Pakistan , in some cases using intelligence provided by Pakistani sources , officials said .
Most counter terrorism operations in Pakistan have been conducted by the CIA ... [ I ] f the CIA were given broader authority , it could call for help from the military or deputise some forces of the Special Operations Command to act under the authority of the agency , ” the article stated .
While the New York Times claimed that no decisions were taken at the January meeting , another article last month reported that the CIA had established a base inside Pakistan .
“ Among other things , the new arrangements allowed an increase in the number and scope of patrols and strikes by armed Predator surveillance aircraft launched from a secret base in Pakistan — a far more aggressive strategy to attack Al Qaeda and the Taliban than had existed before , ” the Times explained .
In its report of Sunday ’s strike , the Times noted that Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence and General Michael Hayden , director of the Central Intelligence Agency , reached an agreement in January with the new Pakistani army chief , General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , to allow the US greater freedom to strike targets in the tribal areas without specific permission from the Pakistani Army .
The article claimed that the US was receiving “ better on - the - ground human intelligence ” by providing “ large cash payments to tribesmen ” .
There has been a marked increase in visits to Pakistan this year by senior American military officers , including two by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen .
During his latest visit on March 4 , Admiral Mullen discussed US assistance to expand Pakistan ’s Frontier Corps to a force of around 85,000 recruited from tribesmen in the border areas .
The Pentagon has already spent around $ 25 million to provide the Frontier Corps with equipment , including vehicles , radios and surveillance devices , and plans to spend another $ 75 million over the next year .
At least two other US aerial attacks have taken place inside Pakistan this year .
On January 29 , a missile destroyed a compound in the village of Khushali Torikhel in North Waziristan , killing 13 people .
US and Pakistani officials claimed that Abu Laith al - Libi , a senior Al Qaeda commander , was among the dead .
On February 28 , a missile strike destroyed an alleged Taliban safe house in the village of Kaloosha in South Waziristan , killing at least 10 people .
A local tribal leader told the Washington Post that women and children were among the dead , and that at least six others were injured .
It is not possible to confirm the identity of the victims of these attacks .
In neighbouring Afghanistan , US officials routinely brand the casualties of US operations as “ Taliban ” and “ Al Qaeda ” and deny civilian deaths even in cases where locals have provided clear evidence to the contrary .
On - the - ground intelligence provided by paid informants is often unreliable and coloured by local rivalries and animosities .
Claims about the outcome of US strikes inside Pakistan are undoubtedly just as uncertain .
Other attacks on targets within Pakistan are taking place from US bases inside Afghanistan .
Pakistani officials lodged a formal complaint with the US military after artillery fire from Afghanistan hit a house in North Waziristan last Wednesday , killing two women and two children .
According to the Pakistani - based News , last Friday four missiles fell on the village of Botraki , just inside the Pakistani border .
The extent of Washington ’s covert war inside Pakistan remains unclear , but such operations are fuelling widespread anger and provoking a rising number of suicide bombings and attacks on Pakistani security forces and other targets .
Last Saturday , a bomb blast at a restaurant in Islamabad popular with foreigners killed a Turkish woman and wounded at least 10 others , including five American officials , two Japanese journalists and a British police officer .
Four of the five Americans were FBI agents operating in Pakistan .
The escalation of US operations can only have a profoundly destabilising impact , not just in the border regions , but throughout Pakistan , which is already wracked by deep political crisis .
While the PPP and PML - N won a decisive victory in last month ’s election , in part because of their criticism of Musharraf ’s collaboration with the US , the mood will quickly turn as the new government seeks to maintain the US alliance amid ongoing American strikes on Pakistani soil .

The evolution of human speech was far more complex than is implied by some recent attempts to link it to a specific gene , says Robert Berwick , professor of computational linguistics at MIT .
Berwick will describe his ideas about language in a session at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Sunday , Feb. 17 .
The session is called " Mind of a Toolmaker , " and explores the use of evolutionary research in understanding human abilities .
Some researchers in recent years have speculated that mutations in a gene called Foxp2 might have played a fundamental role in the evolution of human language .
That was based on research showing that the gene seems to be connected to language ability because some mutations to that gene produce specific impairments to language use , and because our closest living relatives , the chimpanzees , lack both these gene mutations and the capacity for language .
But the claim that the gene mutation is directly connected to the development of language is very unlikely to be right , says Berwick , who holds appointments in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences .
" This kind of straightforward connection is just not the way organisms are put together , " he says .
When it comes to something as complex as language , " one would be hard - pressed to come up with an example less amenable to evolutionary study . "
And the specific Foxp2 connection is based on a whole chain of events , each of which is speculative , so there 's little chance of the whole story being right .
" It 's so chaotic , it 's like weather forecasting , " he says .
" The noise overwhelms the signal . "
Rather , language is almost certainly the result of a far more complex and subtle interplay among a variety of factors , Berwick says , and it may never be possible to connect it to specific genetic changes .
" There are some things in science that are very interesting , but that we 're never going to be able to find out about , " he says .
" It 's a sort of romantic view some people have , that anything interesting can be understood . "
Even defining something as complicated as language in a precise way is daunting , as ongoing disputes over the significance of language experiments with apes , parrots and dolphins have made clear .
Berwick says , " If you can't define what it is , why study it from an evolutionary point of view ? "
It 's more likely , Berwick says , that the role of the Fox p2 gene in language is somehow peripheral to the capacity for language itself .
He compares it to a printer in a computer system -- it 's part of the overall system , but it 's not fundamental .
Berwick thinks a more productive approach to studying the evolution of language is to examine it in terms of deeper , internal mechanisms .
In his own research , Berwick has compared the structure of languages with the structure of bird songs , and has found interesting connections that may lead to a better understanding of some aspects of language .
Both bird songs and all human languages seem to share some underlying characteristics related to their metrical structure , Berwick says .
There 's an underlying sing - song beat that is pronounced in poetry , music and in the songs of birds that may reveal a fundamental aspect of how our brains process language .
Future research could probe this link further , even looking at possible connections between other specific genes , in both birds and humans , that might be connected to this sense of metrical structure .
Ultimately , the important thing is to understand that language is , at bottom , something that takes place inside the human mind and is independent of any particular sound , sight or motion .
The same internal mental construction could be expressed through verbal speech , through writing or through sign language without changing its basic nature , Berwick says .
" It 's not about this external thing you hear , " he says .
" It 's about the representation inside your head . "

What is the nature of consciousness , the mysterious property of self - awareness that we all have and yet which no scientist understands ?
Is there any such thing as free will , or are our minds at the mercy of some unknown force ?
These are the fundamental questions that have perplexed philosophers and , increasingly , scientists for centuries .
Until recently they seemed utterly unfathomable ; after all , how do you test for something like free will in the laboratory ?
Scroll down for more ...
But now science is coming up with some fascinating - and deeply uncomfortable - answers .
This week , for instance , Professor John - Dylan Haynes and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute in Germany report the findings of an extraordinary experiment which seems to show that " free will " - the most cherished tenet of humanity , which decrees that Man has total control of his own actions - may , in fact , be little more than an illusion .
For in their experiment , the scientists found that we may not be making conscious choices at all .
Rather , our subconscious minds may be dictating our actions , long before we realise .
It is a troubling suggestion .
As Prof Haynes says : " The impression that we are freely able to choose between different possible courses of action is fundamental to our mental health . "
If we are not in control after all , then that makes humans little more than automatons .
In his experiment , volunteers were asked to view a stream of letters on a computer screen and told , at some point , of their choosing , to press a button either with their left or right index finger - and remember the letter that was on the screen when they did so .
The volunteers were also connected to brain - scanning MRI machines which were able to monitor and analyse brain patterns .
These " mind - reading " scanners could recognise when the brain had decided on a course of action .
To the researchers ' astonishment , it turned out that the volunteers ' brains would reach a decision about pressing one of the buttons several seconds before the volunteers actually thought they had made up their minds .
The implications are hugely significant , because the experiment suggests that what we think of as a " conscious decision " may , in fact , be no such thing .
The traditional " folk science " picture of the mind has our " conscious self " as a little man sitting in our heads , pushing buttons and pulling levers , filing " thoughts " , receiving messages from eyes and ears and making our muscles move .
What Prof Haynes 's experiment seems to show is that we need a new picture ; instead of that little man pushing and pulling levers , he is merely a passive observer , lazing back in his chair and watching it all happen .
It is as though what we are actually aware of is no more than a film show , and the decision - making is made purely unconsciously .
It is a disturbing picture , because it reinforces the view that we are mere machines , pieces of biological clockwork that have no more free will than a Swiss watch .
This sounds counter to common sense , but the more you think about it the more it is clear that much of what we do is done on " autopilot " and that free will is rarely necessary .
If you regularly drive to work , for instance , at the end of your commute tomorrow try to remember the details of your journey .
The chances are you will not be able recall more than the basics .
When top tennis players are asked to think , consciously , about every stroke and every movement , their game falls to pieces .
Studies of elite sportsmen show that at the top of their game they are performing in a sort of semi-conscious fugue , purely on autopilot .
The " will " , if there is any , comes during the training process , not during the match .
Of course , if we really do not have free will , this opens a can of worms about human morality .
Scroll down for more ...
If the brain is a machine , whose decisions are entirely out of our conscious control , then can a criminal be held responsible for his actions ?
This is a dangerous road to go down .
As Prof Haynes admits : " It would lead to no one being held responsible for anything . "
But this is n't the first time science has given a worrying insight into the workings of our brains .
Earlier this year , Nature magazine reported an extraordinary experiment in mind - reading technology .
No stage magic , smoke or mirrors here - just the clever use of brain - scanning machines and computers to pinpoint and identify actual thoughts as they arise in the brain .
The scientists , led by Dr Jack Gallant of Berkeley University in California , again used MRI scanners to monitor brain activity when volunteers were shown various black and white photographs of everyday scenes - a house and garden , various countryside views and so on .
The scanner and the computer it was attached to first had to " learn " how the brain reacted to thousands of images - what electrical patterns arose when the volunteer was looking at a picture of , say , a house or a car .
The volunteer was then shown photographs and the " mind - reading system " had to work out , from the patterns of electrical activity detected in the brain , what the subject was looking at .
Astonishingly , nine times out of ten the machine was able to work out what the person was looking at .
As the authors freely admit , the way is now open to a general mind - reading machine , " perhaps even to access the visual content of purely mental phenomena , such as dreams and imagery " .
If we can read minds , and even dreams , and prove that free will is a nonsense , then what does that say about the mystery of our minds ?
In fact , the human brain , for all this , remains by far the most mysterious object known to science .
by the most mysterious object known to science .
It is still completely unknown how 3lb of wet jelly , plus tiny electrical currents powered by the energy we release from our food , can give rise to consciousness .
But it does .
Few modern people believe that the brain is pervaded by some sort of mysterious " soul " ; but how the neurones and synapses of the mind can generate subjective experiences of colour , smell , hate , fear and love is an utter mystery .
In fact , many scientists believe it is the greatest mystery of all .
But unless we want to believe in " souls " or " auras " , we must believe that the brain is a machine - a very complicated machine , but a machine nonetheless .
And that means its workings must , in principle , be deducible , that we can predict its every move , as this freewill experiment seems to show .
Does that mean we will one day be able to calculate what powers love , creates artistic masterpieces , sows awe , and experiences both great sorrow and utter joy ?
Maybe one day science will have an explanation for all this , but one suspects that even after the questions of the atoms and quarks , the planets and galaxies are finally answered , the deep puzzle of what exactly is going on in our heads will remain forever unsolved .
And perhaps that 's the way it should be .

Senior Conservative Alan Duncan is to become the first Tory MP to enter into a civil partnership .
The party 's business spokesman will make political history when he exchanges vows with his partner James Dunseath in the summer .
The pair , who announced their intended partnership today , met at a dinner party given by a mutual friend 14 months ago .

Happy couple : Alan Duncan , 50 , and James Dunseath , 39 , are to ' marry ' after meeting at a dinner party 14 months ago
Mr Duncan , 50 , popped the question while they were holidaying in Oman on Valentine 's Day .
He said : " James joked that if I had not asked him on Valentine 's Day he would have asked me on February 29 . "
David Cameron , who embraced same - sex relationships in his first speech as Tory leader , is reported to be ' thrilled ' for Mr Duncan and hopes to attend the planned ceremony at Marylebone register office .
He said last night : " I am absolutely delighted for Alan and James and wish them all the very best . "
Both men come from military backgrounds .
Their families have given their blessing to the union .
Mr Duncan , the first Tory MP to openly declare he is gay , was asked by former leader Michael Howard to head the party 's response to the civil partnership bill .
He said last night : " I never ever imagined that one day I would be a beneficiary of the legislation .
" What James and I are entering into is not a marriage , it is a civil partnership .
You could not find two more conventional people to enter into a civil partnership . "
Mr Dunseath , 39 , a press officer in the City , almost died in 2000 when he was mugged when drawing money from a cash machine in Paris .
Speaking about their plans , he said : " It 's just fantastic .
We hit it off instantly and our friends say we are inseparable .
" He may be a politician but he 's great fun .
We both feel it 's so right and we 're very lucky . "
The news , announced in the Court Social page of the Daily Telegraph , was welcomed in Mr Duncan 's constituency of Rutland and Melton , where he has been the MP since 1992 .
Sheila Randall , a member of the local Conservative association for more than five decades , told the Telegraph : " Alan and James are lovely men .
I was on Alan 's selection committee and have known and liked him ever since .
I am so happy for them both . "
Mr Duncan ' came out ' in 2002 , saying : " Living in disguise as a politician in the modern world simply is n't an option .
" The Tory view has always been , 'we do n't mind , but do n't say ' .
Well , that does n't work any more .
The only realistic way to behave these days is to be absolutely honest and upfront , however inconvenient that may be at first . "
The first MP to enter into a civil partnership was Labour health minister Ben Bradshaw , who went through the ceremony with his long - term partner , BBC producer Neal Dalgleish , in 2006 .
Which clock is the best ?
We can easily rule the one which has stopped …
Or can we ?
In “ The Rectory Umbrella ” Lewis Carroll argues otherwise .
Which is better , a clock that is right only once a year , or a clock that is right twice every day ?
“ The latter , ” you reply , “ unquestionably . ”
Very good , now attend .
I have two clocks : one does n’t go at all , and the other loses a minute a day : which would you prefer ?
“ The losing one , ” you answer , “ without a doubt . ”
Now observe : the one which loses a minute a day has to lose twelve hours , or seven hundred and twenty minutes before it is right again , consequently it is only right once in two years , whereas the other is evidently right as often as the time it points to comes round , which happens twice a day .
It ’s an amusing diversion , but not really that puzzling : of course the clock which loses time is of more practical use , even if , somewhat paradoxically , the less time it loses the less often it tells the right time .
A clock which loses just a second a day only tells the right time every 118 years or so .
I mention these defective clocks because I ’m thinking about bugs in software and how we go about finding and fixing them .
Code which is obviously wrong is easier to spot than code which is almost right , and spotting bugs is the precursor to fixing them .
This implies — building on Carroll ’s terminology — that we ’re unlikely to ship many stopped clocks but if we ’re not careful we may end up delivering a few which lose time .
And , in general , code which is obviously wrong is easier to fix than code which is almost right .
A badly - broken function clearly needs a rethink ; whereas one which almost works may simply get tweaked until it appears to work , often resulting in a more subtle bug .
C and C++ provide a good example of what I ’m talking about .
Consider a program which misuses memory .
An attempt to allocate workspace of 4294967295 bytes fails instantly [ 1 ] ; a slow memory leak , like a slow running clock , may cause no perceptible damage for an extended period .
Decent tools detect memory leaks .
Race conditions in multi - threaded code are harder to track and may prove elusive during system testing .
More than once I ’ve left a program running under a debugger , being fed random inputs , in the hope some rare and apparently random condition will trigger a break in execution .
Give me truly broken code any day !
Here are two implementations of a C function to find an integer midway between a pair of ordered , positive integer values , truncating downwards .
Before reading on , ask yourself which is better .
int midpoint1 ( int low , int high ) { return low / 2 + high / 2 ; } int midpoint2 ( int low , int high ) { return ( low + high ) /2 ; }
Midpoint1 is a “ stopped clock ” , returning 3 instead of 4 as the mid-point of 3 and 5 , for example .
It gets the wrong answer 25 % of the time — fatally wrong were it to be used at the heart of , say , a binary search .
I think we ’d quickly detect the problem .
An obvious fix would be the one shown in midpoint2 which does indeed return 4 as the mid-point of 3 and 5 .
Midpoint2 turns out to be a losing clock , though .
If the sum low + high overflows then the result is undefined .
On my implementation I get a negative value — a dangerous thing to use as an array index .
This is a notorious and very real defect , nicely documented in a note by Joshua Bloch subtitled “ Nearly all Binary Searches and Mergesorts are broken ” .
Bloch offers more than one fix so I ’ll just note here that :
this defect simply does n’t exist in a high - level language like Python or Haskell , where integers are bounded only by machine resources
I think Bloch is unfair to suggest Jon Bentley ’s analysis in chapter 4 of Programming Pearls is wrong .
The pseudo - code in this chapter is written in a C - like language somewhere between C and Python , and in fact one of Bentley ’s exercises is to examine what effect word size has on this analysis .
in a sense , midpoint2 is more broken than midpoint1 : over the range of possible low and high inputs , the sum overflows and triggers the defect 50 % of the time .
Computers are supposed to be predictable and we typically aim for correct programs .
There ’s no reason why we should n’t consider aiming for programs which are good enough , though , and indeed many programs which are good enough to be useful are also flawed .
Google adverts , for example , analyse the contents of web pages and serve up related links .
The algorithm used is secret , clever and quick , but often results in semantic blunders and , on occasion , offensive mistakes .
Few could deny how useful to Google this program has been , though .
Here ’s a more interesting example of an algorithm which , like a losing clock , is nearly right .
def is_fprime (n ) : " " " Use Fermat 's little theorem to guess if n is prime . " " " from random import randrange tries = 3 xs = ( randrange ( 1 , n ) for _ in range ( tries ) ) return all ( ( x ** n ) % n == x for x in xs )
We wo n’t go into the mathematics here .
A quick play with this function looks promising .
>>> all ( is_fprime(n ) for n in [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 ] ) True >>> any ( is_fprime (n ) for n in [ 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 ] ) False
In fact , if we give it a real work - out on some large numbers , it does well .
I used it to guess which of the numbers between 100000 and 102000 were prime , comparing the answer with the correct result ( the code is at the end of this article ) .
It had a better than 99 % success rate ( in clock terms , it lost around 8 minutes a day ) and increasing tries will boost its performance .
The better is_fprime performs , the less likely we are to spot that it ’s wrong .
What ’s worse , though , is that it can not be fixed by simple tweaking .
However high we set tries we wo n’t have a correct function .
We could even take the random probing out of the function and shove every single value of x in the range 1 to n into the predicate :
def exhaustive_is_fprime(n ) : return all ( (x ** n ) % n == x for x in range ( 1 , n ) )
Exhaustive_is_fprime is expensive to run and will ( very ) occasionally return True for a composite number [ 2 ] .
If you want to know more , search for Carmichael numbers .
The point I ’m making is that code which is almost right can be dangerous .
We are tempted to fix it by adjusting the existing implementation , even if , as in this case , a complete overhaul is required .
By contrast , we all know what needs doing with code which is plainly wrong .
We ’ve all seen nervous functions which go beyond their stated interface in an attempt to protect themselves from careless users .
/** * Return the maximum value found in the input array .
* Pre-condition : the input array must not be empty .
*/ int nervy_maximum_value ( int const * items , size_t count ) { int M = - INT_MAX ; if ( items == NULL || count == 0 ) { return M ; } for ( ; count -- != 0 ; ++items ) { if ( * items > M ) { M = * items ; } } return M ; }
What ’s really wanted is both simpler and easier for clients to code against .
int maximum_value ( int const * items , size_t count ) { int const * const end = items + count ; int M = * items ++ ; for ( ; items != end ; ++items ) { if ( * items > M ) { M = * items ; } } return M ; }
Did you spot the subtle bug in nervy_maximum_value ?
It uses - INT_MAX instead of INT_MIN which will cause trouble if clients code against this undocumented behaviour ; if nervy_maximum_value is subsequently fixed , this client code back - fires .
Note that I ’m not against the use of assertions to check pre-conditions , and a simple assert ( items != NULL && count !=
0 ) works well in maximum_value ; it ’s writing code which swallows these failed pre-conditions I consider wrong .
The occurrence of defects in complex software systems can be modelled in the same way as radioactive decay .
I have n’t studied this theory and my physics is rusty [ 3 ] , but the basic idea is that the population of bugs in some software is rather like a population of radioactive particles .
Any given bug fires ( any given particle decays ) at random , so we ca n’t predict when this event will happen , but it is equally likely to fire at any particular time .
This gives each defect an average lifetime : a small lifetime for howling defects , such as dereferencing NULL pointers , and a longer one for more subtle problems , such as accumulated rounding errors .
Assuming we fix a bug once it occurs , the population of defects decays exponentially , and we get the classic tailing - off curve .
Anyone who has ever tried to release a software product knows how it feels to slide down the slope of this curve .
We system test , find bugs , fix them , repeat .
At the start it can be exhilarating as bugs with short half - lives fall out and get squashed , but the end game is demoralising as defects get reported which then cannot be reproduced , and we find ourselves clawing out progress .
When we eventually draw the line and ship the product we do so suspecting the worst problems are yet to be found .
To put it more succinctly [ 4 ] .
Ship happens !
A combination of techniques can help us escape this depressing picture .
The most obvious one would be to avoid it : rather than aim for “ big - bang ” releases every few years , we can move towards continual and incremental delivery .
A modular , decoupled architecture helps .
So does insistence on unit testing .
Rather than shake the system and sweep up the bugs which fall off we should develop a suite of automated tests which actively seek the various paths through the code , and exercise edge cases .
Within the code - base , as already mentioned , defensive programming can cause defects to become entrenched .
Instead , we should adopt a more confident style , where code fails hard and fast .
Have you ever fixed a defect and wondered how the code ever even appeared to work before your fix ?
It ’s an important question and one which requires investigation .
Perhaps the bug you ’ve fixed is compensated for by defensive programming elsewhere .
Or perhaps there are vast routes through the code which have yet to be exercised .
None of these clocks is much good .
The first has stopped , the second loses a second every minute , the third gains a second every minute .
At least it ’s easy to see the problem with the first : we wo n’t be tempted to patch it .
We should never expect our code to work first time and we should be suspicious if it appears to do so .
Defensive programming seems to mean different things to different people .
If I ’ve misused the term here , I ’m sorry .
Our best defence is to assume code is broken until we ’ve tested it , to assume it will break in future if our tests are not automated , and to fail hard and fast when we detect errors .

In the first version of this article I wrote that an attempt to allocate 4294967295 bytes would cause the program to crash , which is n’t quite right .
Malloc returns NULL in the event of failure ; standard C++ operator new behaviour is to throw a bad_alloc exception .
My thanks to R Samuel Klatchko for the correction .
[ 2 ] “ Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ” discusses Carmichael numbers in a footnote
Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called Carmichael numbers , and little is known about them other than that they are extremely rare .
There are 255 Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000 .
The smallest few are 561 , 1105 , 1729 , 2465 , 2821 , and 6601 .
In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at random , the chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less than the chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error in carrying out a “ correct ” algorithm .
Considering an algorithm to be inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the difference between mathematics and engineering .

Being lazy and online I thought I ’d search for a nice radioactive decay graphic rather than draw my own .
I found a real gem on the University of Colarado site , where Kyla and Bob discuss radioactive decay .
Hmmm…so a lot of decays happen really fast when there are lots of atoms , and then things slow down when there are n’t so many .
The halflife is always the same , but the half gets smaller and smaller .
That ’s exactly right .
Here ’s another applet that illustrates radioactive decay in action .
Visit the site to play with the applet Bob mentions .
You ’ll find more Kyla and Bob pictures there too .

I ’m unable to provide a definitive attribution for the “ Ship happens ! ” quotation .
I first heard it from Andrei Alexandrescu at an ACCU conference , who in turn thinks he got it from Erich Gamma .
I have n’t managed to contact Erich Gamma .
Matthew B. Doar reports using the term back in 2002 , and it appears as a section heading in his book “ Practical Development Environments ” .
Vice President Richard Cheney , parting company with the official Bush Administration position on the test case before the Supreme Court on the Second Amendment , signed onto a brief Friday urging the Justices to strike down the District of Columbia handgun ban without ordering any further proceedings .
The brief — representing the views of a majority of the members of the Senate and of the House — explicitly endorsed the “ categorical approach ” that the D.C. Circuit Court used in declaring the pistol ban invalid under the Second Amendment .
That decision , the brief argued , should simply be affirmed , thus nullifying outright the local law .
The brief can be downloaded here .
In contrast , the Justice Department — speaking for the Administration — told the Court on Jan. 11 that the Circuit Court had used too strict a constitutional standard , and should be told to reconsider its decision .
The government filing took no direct position on the validity of the D.C. law .
The Circuit Court should reconsider that question , the Department contended , using a “ more flexible standard of review . ”
The Department did urge the Court , though , to rule now that the Second Amendment does protect an individual right to have a gun for private use .
The filing was not labeled as a supporting brief for either side in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller ( 07-290 ) , now scheduled for argument March 18 .
The Vice President signed the brief — along with 55 senators and 250 representatives — in his role as the Senate ’s presiding officer : that is , as President of the Senate .
The Vice President , though , obviously has a dual role as the No. 2 leader of the Executive Branch — the branch usually represented in Court by the Justice Department — as well as presiding officer of one part of the Legislative Branch .
It is rare , if not unprecedented , for the Vice President to take a position directly contrary to the stance taken by the Justice Department .
The congressional brief represents the views of 55 senators — 46 Republicans , nine Democrats — and 250 representatives — 182 Republicans , 68 Democrats , along with the Vice President .
Texas GOP Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchinson , instrumental in the assembly of signers of the brief , said in a statement that " the reason the amicus brief , signed by a majority of the House and Senate , including Vice President Dick Cheney , is significant is because the legislative history should be part of the record in the case .
The debate on the Bill of Rights and subsequent Congressional action makes clear that the Founders and elected Representatives since the adoption of the Bill of Rights have considered the Second Amendment a protection of individual rights . ”
News accounts earlier Friday about the brief mentioned the wide array of support for the brief in the Senate and House , but did not mention the Vice President ’s decision to add his support .
That became clear when the actual brief was filed Friday .
Finally , a real solution to global warming .
We take away every male 's automobile and replace it with one of these .
Sperm count will decrease dramatically , and the number of children born will be but a small percentage of what it was originally .
With less population , we will be putting significantly less CO2 into the air , and the human race will finally be saved from itself .
Of course , it might be easier to just nuke a certain percetage of human beings .
But , that would be considered even more cruel than this device , so this is a much better option .
NOTE : This was an April Fools joke for April 1st , 2008 .
Over the past two years , seeing hundreds of thousands of people use jQuery , a major point has become apparent : j Query simply is n’t able to scale to handle the development needs of most power users .
It lacks the clarity and power functionality that most developers need in order build applications in a collaborative environment .
For this reason I ’ve put a lot of work into a new library ( which sits on top of jQuery ) , called :
Classy Query
» View Source to Classy Query
If one thing has become apparent to me it ’s that users enjoy working with the typical Class - style of object creation and inheritance .
Because of this I ’ve constructed the entirety of Classy Query in an classical manner ( you can inherit and override any piece of functionality that you desire ) .
Before we go too far , let ’s take a look at the type of clearly - defined code that you can now write with Classy Query :
< script src=" jquery.js " ></ script > < script src=" classy.js " ></ script > < script > jQuery.Events.addEventListener( document , " ready " , function ( ) { jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div " ) .forEach( function ( elem ) { jQuery.DOM.append(elem , " < b> More ...</b > " ) ; } ) ; jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div b " ) . forEach( function ( elem ) { jQuery.Events.addEventListener(elem , " click " , function ( elem , event ) { var next = j Query.Traversal.nextSibling(elem ) ; var animation = jQuery.Effects.buildAnimation ( next , {height : " toggle "} ) ; amimation.start( ) ; } ) ; } ) ; } ) ; </script >
You can even sub -class functionality , creating your own pieces of encapsulation .
All of the class and inheritance functionality is taken care of by the Simple JavaScript Inheritance code released last week .
jQuery.DOM.boldWrapInner = jQuery.DOM.wrapInner.extend({ attach : function ( elem ) { this .
_super ( elem , " < b ></b > " ) ; } } ) ; jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div " ) .forEach(function ( elem ) { jQuery.DOM.boldWrapInner( elem ) ; } ) ;
Additionally you can treat pieces of functionality as if they were attachable behaviors , like so :
jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div " ).attach ( new jQuery.DOM.boldWrapInner ( ) ) ;
There ’s a number of core features encompassed in Classy Query that really help to transform the traditional jQuery experience into something much more usable .
Class creation
The full Simple JavaScript Inheritance API is included in Classy Query , allowing you to extend and create JavaScript ‘ classes ’ , like so :
var Person = jQuery .Class.create({ init : function ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } } ) ; var ClassyDude = Person.extend ( { sipWine : function ( ) { return " Has a beautiful bouquet . " ; } } ) ;
Inheritance
It ’s possible to inherit from any existing piece of Classy Query functionality , supporting a true ‘ programming in the large ’ mindset .
You can inherit from , or completely override , existing methods with ease ( especially since they ’re all classes ) .
jQuery.Effects.collapse = jQuery.Effects.buildAnimation.extend({ attach : function ( elem ) { this .
_super ( elem , {height : " hide " , width : " hide " } ) ; } } ) ;
Behaviors
Behaviors tend to encapsulate a portion of functionality which is applied against an element ( such as making a table sortable or making an item draggable ) .
Classy Query supports a technique to make this particular implementation trivial .
jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div " ) .attach ( new jQuery.DOM.addClassName(" current " ) ) ;
No more ‘ this ’
The ‘ this ’ keyword is confusing and frequently misused .
To counter this all access to elements ( within functions ) is done by the first argument , rather than through ‘ this ’ .
jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div " ) .forEach( function ( elem ) { jQuery.DOM.addClassName(elem , " current " ) ; } ) ;
Re-Structuring
The hierarchy of jQuery has been completely re-organized .
Rather than having a single , flat , interface through which to access all methods functionality has been broken down into individual groupings of methods .
These groupings tend to , also , coordinate with the jQuery Documentation for convenience .
Additionally , nearly all the method names have been re-named in order to provide a greater level of clarity to developers .
Frequently it was found that the concise method names of jQuery provided too much confusion to developers just getting started with the library .
The end result is a library that is easier to read and understand for developers .
The full list of categories and changed methods can be found in the following table :
j Query Classy Query jQuery jQuery.querySelectorAll each forEach prepend jQuery.DOM .
prepend append jQuery.DOM .append before jQuery.DOM.insertBefore after jQuery.DOM.insertAfter wrap jQuery.DOM.wrap wrapInner jQuery.DOM.wrapInner wrapAll jQuery.DOM.wrapAll clone jQuery.DOM.clone empty jQuery.DOM.empty remove jQuery.DOM .remove replaceWith jQuery.DOM.replaceWith removeAttr jQuery.DOM.removeAttribute addClass jQuery.DOM.addClassName hasClass jQuery.DOM.hasClassName removeClass jQuery.DOM.removeClassName offset jQuery.DOM.getOffset text jQuery.DOM.getText text jQuery.DOM.setText html jQuery.DOM.getHTML
html jQuery.DOM.setHTML attr jQuery.DOM.getAttribute attr jQuery.DOM.setAttribute val jQuery.DOM.getValue val jQuery.DOM.setValue height jQuery.DOM.getHeight height jQuery.DOM.setHeight width jQuery.DOM.getWidth width jQuery .DOM.setWidth css jQuery.DOM.getCSS css jQuery.DOM.setCSS children jQuery .
Traverse.getChildElements find jQuery .
Traverse.getDescendantElements next jQuery .

querySelector and querySelectorAll
Finally , rather than having a generic , catch - all , method as jQuery selector functionality is deferred to the new querySelector and querySelectorAll methods .
These methods only support pure CSS 1 - 3 selectors ( nothing extra ) in an attempt to avoid any unpleasant situations when a browser ’s native querySelectorAll is implemented .
jQuery.querySelectorAll ( " div " ) .forEach( function ( elem ) { jQuery.Effect.hide ( elem ) ; } ) ; jQuery.Effect.hide ( jQuery.querySelector ( " #item " ) )

I hope this particular library will be of use to the general jQuery - using population .
I hope we can start to have an open dialog , moving forward , getting everyone to adopt a more standard approach to JavaScript development .
There ’s no reason why we should n’t be using this tried - and - true approach to application development .
It ’s worked in an untold number of existing applications , it ’s bound to work here as well .
Enjoy .

Advertisement Scientists have been able to take control of flies ' brains to make females behave just like males .
Researchers genetically modified the insects so that a group of brain cells that control sexual behaviour could be " switched on " by a pulse of light .
The team was able to get female fruit flies to produce a courtship song - behaviour usually only seen in males .
The study , published in the journal Cell , suggests that the wiring in male and female flies ' brains is similar .
What would happen if we turned the neurons on in females
Gero Miesenboeck Gero Miesenboeck , from Oxford University , UK , who carried out the research with J. Dylan Clyne from Yale University , US , said : " It is often the case that males have to work very hard to convince females to mate with them .
" In many animal species , males have to put on elaborate courtship displays to impress females - even the tiny fruit fly . "
Male fruit flies will vibrate one of their wings to produce a barely audible song , explained Professor Miesenboeck .
" And if the female likes that sound , she 'll surrender to his advances . "
Previous research has revealed that a group of 2,000 brain cells are necessary for this courtship behaviour in the insects ; however , both male and female fruit flies appear to possess most of these neurons .
Professor Miesenboeck said : " It looks like males and females have very similar neuronal equipment , yet they behave so differently - only the male sings , and only the female responds to the song by allowing a male to copulate with her .
" The big question is : why - what is the difference ? "
To investigate , the team placed some flies in a " mini sound studio " .
The insects had been genetically modified so that a pulse of light would activate this group of courtship neurons .

First of all , the researchers looked at male flies and found that the light would indeed spark a song .
" The second , more exciting question we wanted to ask , was what would happen if we turned the neurons on in females .
" Females do n't normally show this kind of behaviour , but we wanted to find out if they had a hidden capacity to do it , " explained Professor Miesenboeck .
As the light pulsed through the chamber , video footage shows the female fruit fly lifting and vibrating one of her wings to produce a song .
The next stage was to find out how effective the artificially induced songs were as mating calls .
For this , the " Cyrano de Bergerac " test was applied .

Advertisement A male and female fly were placed in the sound studio .
The male fly had had his wings altered so that he could not produce any sound .
The mute couple were then played the recorded courtship songs produced by the mind - controlled male and female flies .
" The artificially activated male songs proved seductive , " Professor Miesenboeck told the BBC News .
The flies were placed in a mini sound studio
However , the music produced by the female did little to get the mute flies in the mood for mating .
Professor Miesenboeck explained : " When we analysed the songs , we found there were subtle differences between the male song and the artificially induced female song - the pitch was a bit off , the rhythm was off , the song , overall , was less well controlled . "
Nevertheless , the researchers say the study reveals that male and female brains are extremely similar in flies - even the circuits thought to be dedicated to sexual behaviours such as courtship .
The next question to answer , said Professor Miesenboeck , was if both males and females had the capacity to create courtship songs , why was it that only the males did so under normal circumstances ?
He said he thought there might be a handful of " master switches " or " command centres " in the flies ' brains that were set to male or female mode .
" Our next goal is to find these switches , " he added .

What are these ?
A team of European scientists has triggered electrical activity in thunderclouds for the first time - deliberately .
They did it by aiming high - power pulses of laser light into a thunderstorm .
Next , they say , could be man -made lightning .
At the top of South Baldy Peak in New Mexico during two passing thunderstorms , the researchers used laser pulses to create plasma filaments that could conduct electricity akin to Benjamin Franklin 's silk kite string .
No air - to - ground lightning was triggered because the filaments were too short - lived , but the laser pulses generated discharges in the thunderclouds themselves .
" This was an important first step toward triggering lightning strikes with laser beams , " says Jérôme Kasparian of the University of Lyon in France .
" It was the first time we generated lighting precursors in a thundercloud . "
The next step of generating full - blown lightning strikes may come , he adds , after the team reprograms their lasers to use more sophisticated pulse sequences that will make longer - lived filaments to further conduct the lightning during storms .
Triggering lightning strikes is an important tool for basic and applied research because it enables researchers to study the mechanisms underlying lightning strikes .
Moreover , triggered lightning strikes will allow engineers to evaluate and test the lightning - sensitivity of airplanes and critical infrastructure such as power lines .
Pulsed lasers represent a potentially very powerful technology for triggering lightning because they can form a large number of plasma filaments – ionized channels of molecules in the air that act like conducting wires extending into the thundercloud .
This is such a simple concept that the idea of using lasers to trigger lightning strikes was first suggested more than 30 years ago .
But scientists have not been able to accomplish this to date because previous lasers have not been powerful enough to generate long plasma channels .
The current generation of more powerful lasers , like the one developed by Kasparian ’s team , may change that .
Kasparian and his colleagues involved in the Teramobile project , an international program initiated by National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) in France and the German Research Foundation ( DFG ) , built a powerful mobile laser capable of generating long plasma channels by firing ultrashort laser pulses .
They chose to test their laser at the Langmuir Laboratory in New Mexico , which is equipped to measure atmospheric electrical discharges .
Sitting at the top of 10,500 - foot South Baldy Peak , this laboratory is in an ideal location because its altitude places it close to the high thunderclouds .
During the tests , the research team quantified the electrical activity in the clouds after discharging laser pulses .
Statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed — in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels .
The limitation of the experiment , though , was that they could not generate plasma channels that lived long enough to conduct lightning all the way to the ground .
The plasma channels dissipated before the lightning could travel more than a few meters along them .
The team is currently looking to increase the power of the laser pulses by a factor of 10 and use bursts of pulses to generate the plasmas much more efficiently .
Lightning strikes have been the subject of scientific investigation dating back to the time of Benjamin Franklin , but despite this , remain not fully understood .
Although scientists have been able to trigger lightning strikes since the 1970s by shooting small rockets into thunderclouds that spool long wires connected to the ground , typically only 50 percent of rocket launches actually trigger a lightning strike .
The use of laser technology would make the process quicker , more efficient and cost - effective and would be expected to open a number of new applications .
Kasparian conducted the research with his colleagues at CNRS , the University of Lyon , the University of Geneva , École Polytechnique and ENSTA in Palaiseau , France , the Free University of Berlin and the Dresden - Rossendorf Research Center as part of the Teramobile project .
This work was funded jointly by the CNRS , DFG , the French and German ministries of foreign affairs , Agence Nationale de la Recherche , Fonds national suisse de la recherche scientifique , and the Swiss Secrétariat d' État à l'Éducation et à la Recherche .

For a while now , I have been thinking about what George W. Bush signifies from a socio-political perspective .
Looking at the world from the time of the ‘ Big Bang ’ of September 11th , 2001 , until today almost seven years later , one can clearly observe how monstrous our human interaction has become .
After much reading and analysis , I now understand that September 11th was not the starting point of a new world order , but to the contrary , it was purely the end of a specific human state of affairs .
When one grows up in the west , our history books tell us stories about past events in our world .
As we grow up , those same stories shape the way in which we look at the world around us .
Once this history is indoctrinated into our minds , it frames the scope of our objective judgment .
This in turn , leads to a very narrow analysis of our current reality .
As westerners we have the tendency to feel superior to the rest of the human species .
Somehow , we have come to believe that our crusades , empires and colonization have led us to a higher understanding of kindness , compassion , love and equality .
As westerners , we seem to see ourselves in a higher plane of collective awareness , intellectual and spiritual attainment .
I do not doubt for a single minute that in other cultures they have similar prejudices , but I learned from an early age through Christian scriptures , that one must look deep into his or her consciousness , in order to identify mistakes and make corrections .
Therefore , for me it is important to focus only on the culture that I know , I live , and that I am an active member of -- the western world , as defined by the politicians of the ‘ Axis of Good ’ who govern us .
We are very comfortable in the west , all of us .
Even the most deprived are not as deprived as the whole of Iraq , and by the whole of Iraq , I do mean everyone including the Al Qaeda terrorists , the international soldiers , the Iraqi militias , the possible Iranian insurgents , the government officials , doctors and nurses , contractors , private army operatives , NGO workers , the rich , the poor , the women , men and the children .
Nobody there is as good as we are here .
Iraq is just one of the many examples of places where the whole population is on its knees as we in the west enjoy our ‘ morally evolved ’ societies .
People in Haiti are eating mud cakes because of the soaring food prices , the people in Gaza have no electricity , in Afghanistan , the only royal visit they receive , is of a British prince dressed in military gear going to kill on Afghan soil .
In India , the farmers are committing suicide due to failed harvests of genetically modified Monsanto crops .
Around the world , people are rioting because of lack of food or basic human necessities .
Yet in the west , we can move around freely , we can cross borders and fly our budget airlines from capital to capital , observing the comforts of western existence .
Organized streets , clean cars , wonderful shopping malls , great monuments , everything is civilized and could be admired , that is , if it was honest .
But it is n’t , it is morally wrong and deep down we all know it .
We know it , but we just do n’t want to do anything about it , because we are comfortable .
Only a very small proportion of the population would truly change their position for that of a person in Iraq .
I suppose that is why we choose to keep Iraq as a problem of our governments , and the terrorists whom must be eliminated to protect us from ‘ evil ’ .
As westerners , we feel that our commitment to morality and justice is apparent once in a while , with an Anti-War demonstration scheduled in a city for a particular day .
We come out to the streets that day , all united , the young ‘ Che ’ impersonator , holding hands with the 60’s hippy , the businessman who inherited his mother ’s company and is well established within his city , the University professor who still holds faithful to her ‘ liberal ’ values , the working class family which feels that a one day revolution is better than nothing , the yuppie banker , etc … Representations of various segments of our population are present at the event .
It lasts a few hours , there is music on the streets , the cameras are filming everything to air it across the television channels of the world .
Once the demonstration is over , we all go back to our jobs , we have expressed our concern on schedule and we should not disrupt the system of things any longer .
After all , we all have bills to pay , we all must take care of our families or simply ourselves , and there is not that much we can do beyond demonstrations .
At least that is the sentiment , which seems to perpetrate from the tragic reality of these events , which although well intended are not truly committed .
True commitment to stopping the war in Iraq requires a global human rights strike , in which the working population of the world stops producing , until the governments and the corporations realize that the voice of the people does indeed matter .
If we had the courage to do this , the power would shift automatically from the politicians , bankers and corporations to the majority of the population .
This would have been unimaginable just seven years ago , but with the advances in communication technologies and the global mobility of the work force , a global change is plausible .
People in the west however , are generally not interested in change , at the moment .
Things are still good .
We are having hiccups in our economies and problems in our internal social systems , but these issues are not yet affecting a large enough proportion of our population , in order to get us united .
Besides , most people are not fully aware of the connection between the human strife in other countries and the policies of our governments and growth strategies of global corporations .
Right now , for most of the west , it would be too cumbersome to focus honestly , on the cruelty which our governments are perpetrating around the world to keep us from loosing our mortgaged style of living .
As speculators are busy speculating with food and commodity prices , causing instant death around the world and indescribable misery , creating a market for ‘ blood food ’ and ‘ blood oil ’ .
We in the west will attribute this failure to a few unwanted elements in our society .
It is evident now , that if the west attacks Iran , the western population will pinpoint the blame on George W. Bush .
He will then move on , and someone will clean up the mess .
The fact remains however , that George W. Bush is indeed serving the interests of America and its allies .
Unless the western population is willing to lower its standard of living and cut down on its thirst for natural resources , we are going to fight a perpetual war , defending our privileges and exploiting the basic human rights of others .
For this war , George W. Bush is the right man .
However , if we decide that annihilating the rest of the world is not the way to go about it .
We must learn to cut back on spending , organize ourselves as tax payers , and begin to demand disarmament from our governments , to pull them out of those apparently " unwanted " wars .
Until then , the diamonds in our stores will be bloody , the food in our supermarkets will be bloody and the gasoline at our pumps will be bloody .
Washing our hands of the problem will maybe help us in the short - term , but in the long term , we will see that just like in the times of the Nazi ’s , our collective hands are tainted with innocent blood .
It is time for the west to accept that although some might hate George W. Bush ’s style , he is fighting to guarantee our privileges and is a reflection of our socio-political interests .
Let us stop our double standards and begin to look at our reality .
A lot of people are dying hoping for some solidarity , yet in the west , we are reluctant to accept responsibility for our cruelty to other human beings .

Ms Pelosi - a fierce critic of Beijing - heads a congressional delegation
Nancy Pelosi
A senior US lawmaker , Nancy Pelosi , has called for an independent investigation into China 's claims that the Dalai Lama instigated the violence in Tibet .
Ms Pelosi , Speaker of the US House of Representatives , also called on the international community to denounce Chinese rule in Tibet .
She spoke out while holding talks in northern India with the Dalai Lama .
The Chinese authorities are continuing to tighten security following days of protests by Tibetans .
China says 19 people have been killed by rioters in Lhasa , the main city .
The Tibetan government - in - exile - headed by the Dalai Lama , regarded by many Tibetans as their spiritual leader - says at least 99 people have died in the crackdown by Chinese troops .
The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world
Nancy Pelosi Chinese officials have accused the Dalai Lama and his supporters of organising violent clashes in Tibet in an attempt to sabotage this summer 's Beijing Olympics and promote Tibetan independence .
Correspondents say the protests have presented the biggest challenge to Chinese rule in Tibet in almost two decades .
Olympics boycott Speaking in Dharamsala , seat of Tibet 's government - in - exile , Ms Pelosi said : " We call upon the international community to have an independent outside investigation on accusations made by the Chinese government that His Holiness [ the Dalai Lama ] was the instigator of violence in Tibet . "
Chinese police and troops have converged on restive areas
She added : " The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world .
" If freedom - loving people throughout the world do not speak out against China and the Chinese in Tibet , we have lost all moral authority to speak out on human rights . "
Ms Pelosi said she was not seeking a boycott of the Beijing Olympics , but warned that the " world is watching " events in China .
Ms Pelosi is one of the sharpest critics of Beijing 's human rights record in the US Congress .
Her visit at the head of a congressional delegation was planned before the protests began .
Rifles and bayonets Anti-China protests began on 10 March in Lhasa and gradually escalated , spreading to Tibetan communities in neighbouring Gansu , Sichuan and Qinghai provinces .
TIBETAN PROTESTS
Tibet : Protests began in Lhasa on 10 March , dozens reported dead over weekend Gansu : Unrest spread to Machu , where Tibetan government in exile says 19 died , and near Hezuo , where protesters were filmed tearing down Chinese flag Sichuan : State media says four people ' shot and wounded ' by police in Aba Qinghai :
Other unrest reported
Key events and places Tibet 's unsettled borders Hezuo silent amid build - up China is not allowing foreign journalists into Tibet .
Troops have also sealed off towns in the surrounding areas where unrest has taken place , witnesses say .
But the BBC's James Reynolds spent 24 hours in Hezuo in Gansu , where earlier this week Tibetan protesters tore down the Chinese flag .
Chinese security forces had swamped the town and the streets were full of police cars , check points and military trucks .
On the southern entrance to Hezuo there were rows of soldiers carrying AK47 rifles and bayonets , our correspondent said .
Public notices and police broadcasts told protesters to surrender by midnight on 25 March or face arrest and punishment .
Other witnesses have reported seeing hundreds of troop carriers heading for Tibetan areas in recent days .
Protesters shot On Thursday Chinese authorities admitted for the first time that members of the security forces had fired on Tibetan protesters .
Police wounded four protesters " in self - defence " last Sunday in Aba county , a Tibetan area of Sichuan province , Xinhua news agency said .
An earlier Xinhua report said police had shot the four dead , but it was quickly changed .
Tibetan activists say police killed protesters in Aba Xinhua did not provide further details of the incident , but Tibetan activists say at least eight people were killed at a demonstration against Chinese rule near the Kirti monastery in Aba on Sunday .
Earlier this week , the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy circulated photos of bodies with apparent gunshot wounds , which it said were the result of police firing indiscriminately at protesters .
On Thursday , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held telephone talks with her Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi , in which she urged Beijing to show restraint .
But Mr
Yang told her the protesters were trying to sabotage both the Olympics and social stability - and reiterated China 's position that it blamed the Dalai Lama for the violence .
The Dalai Lama - who in 1989 won the Nobel Peace Price for his commitment to non-violence in the quest for Tibetan self - rule - has called for talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao .

What are these ?
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - British physicist Peter Higgs said on Monday it should soon be possible to prove the existence of a force which gives mass to the universe and makes life possible -- as he first argued 40 years ago .
British physicist Peter Higgs gestures during a press conference on the sideline of his visit to the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Geneva , April 7 , 2008 .
Higgs said on Monday he expects proof will be found soon of an all - pervading force giving mass to the universe and making life possible - existence of which he predicted over 40 years ago .
REUTERS / Fabrice Coffrini / Pool
Higgs said he believes a particle named the “ Higgs boson ” , which originates from the force , will be found when a vast particle collider at the CERN research centre on the Franco - Swiss border begins operating fully early next year .
“ The likelihood is that the particle will show up pretty quickly ...
I ’m more than 90 percent certain that it will , ” Higgs told journalists .
The 78 - year - old ’s original efforts in the early 1960s to explain why the force , dubbed the Higgs field , must exist were dismissed at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research .
Today , the existence of the invisible field is widely accepted by scientists , who believe it came into being milliseconds after the Big Bang created the universe some 15 billion years ago .
Finding the Higgs boson would prove this theory right .
CERN ’s new Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) aims to simulate conditions at the time of that primeval inferno by smashing particles together at near light - speed and so unlock many secrets of the universe .
Higgs was in Geneva to visit CERN for the first time in 13 years in advance of the launch .
Scientists at the centre hope the process will produce clear signs of the boson , dubbed the “ God particle ” by some , to the displeasure of Higgs , an atheist .
He came up with his theory to explain why mass disappears as matter is broken down to its smallest constituent parts -- molecules , atoms and quarks .
BIG BANG
The normally media - shy physicist , who has spent most of his career at Scotland ’s Edinburgh University , postulated that matter was weightless at the exact moment of the Big Bang and then much of it promptly gained mass .
This , he argued , must be due to a field which stuck to particles as they passed through it and made them heavy .
If this had not happened , matter would have floated free in space and stars and planets would never have formed .
Higgs said he hoped the elusive boson -- which an earlier but less powerful collider at CERN and another at the U.S. Fermilab had failed to detect -- would be identified before his 80th birthday in 2009 .
“ If it does n’t , ” he said , “ I shall be very , very puzzled . ”
But there may be no immediate visible proof -- despite some fanciful portrayals of what it might look like -- of the boson ’s appearance on the ultra- sophisticated computers used by CERN scientists to track the billions of collisions in the LHC .
“ It all happens so fast that the appearance of the boson may be hidden in the data collected , and it could take a long time for the analysis to find it , ” said Higgs .
“ I may have to keep the champagne on ice for a while yet . ”
I recently joined BookCrossing.com after I found a copy of the " The Perfect Storm , " by Sebastian Junger , on a bookshelf at one of those cozy new McDonald's .
A note , taped to the inside cover , revealed the book 's connection to this online community : " When you are finished , please pass this book along to someone else who will enjoy it . "
Here 's how BookCrossing.com works :
You leave a book in a public place and wait for someone to find it .
That person registers their discovery online and the book is tracked as it travels from person to person .
At last , I thought , an easy way to rid our sagging bookshelves of my husband 's books and gain some space for my own !
I would scour Chicago 's suburbs for appropriate drop - off sites and , little by little , chip away at my spouse 's book collection .
I marveled at my husband 's Greek Bible when we first dated and he read aloud in the original Greek .
It was so romantic .
But now after more than a decade of marriage , it just looks , well , big .
It would be the first to go .
Aristotle 's " Theory of Poetry and Fine Art " and Lucretius 's " De Rerum Natura " – those guys would be next .
But then I hesitated .
What if someone shopping at Victoria 's Secret stumbled upon my spouse 's copy of Augustine 's " Confessions ? "
Would the 4th - century bishop end up among some lace , misunderstood ?
And Cicero at the outlet mall sounded more like an ancient reality show than an appropriate site for a great orator .
Yet why should I care where Nietzsche ended up ?
So what if some guy taking inventory found my husband 's personal copy of " Thus Sprach Zarathustra " in the toothpaste aisle at Walgreens ?
The whole point was to get rid of books like that – no matter what the cost .
But then again , if a mom looking for Tide at Costco saw the personal notes my lifelong partner had scribbled in the margins of Kafka 's weird story about that big bug , what would she think ?
Still , I persevered .
I scouted malls and fast - food restaurants , my little red Honda heavy with the thoughts of all those great men .
I hauled bags of books up and down escalators .
I ruminated over drop - off sites for translations of the Iliad .
Then I thought about my Romantic poets , lying in a heap on our library floor , waiting for shelf space .
If the tables were turned , could I really dump Byron and Keats at Burger King ?
On the other hand , if I did n't send his Socrates to Sears soon , my poets would never get their time on the shelf .
So , with much trepidation , I dropped Homer at Wrigley Field , left Heraclitus at the water park , and tucked " Leaves of Grass " under a lawn mower at Home Depot .
At last ... room for Shelley .

As all the “ Super Tuesdays ” and annoying politician bashing commercials finally see a light at the end of the tunnel , I could n’t help but laugh at the many spoofs out there directed at Republican and Democratic candidates alike .
If you can tell my political leaning from this post , than I ’m not doing a good job at remaining objective ( who said I was trying ) , but all the politicians who were either in the race at some point or have made it down to the wire have flaws that we can all point and laugh at .
From conservative extremist Huckabee to feminist nazi
Hilary , each candidate certainly brings their own flare , and fare , to the table .
Romney and Guiliani Go Gangster
Rudy and Mitt ’s little squabble at the beginning of the CNN debates seemed to work all too well with Sam and Nicky ’s dialogue from the movie Casino .
Finally , something that seems like a real and candid conversation between politicians .
HuckChuck
I can’t actually figure out if this is a real endorsement or a spoof ?
Why is it that people think that just because some retarded celebrity endorses something , then it must be good .
Who said they had any merit on the topic anyway ?
Weird .
Subliminal Jesus
Sometimes his speeches really did n’t seem too far from this spoof ; with the big man upstairs himself endorsing this oh - so - righteous one .
And , he ’s still in the race !
Barack vs. Hilary JKL Dance Off
Surprised at who won this dance off ?
I love the message it implies with what is happening iin the democratic race .
This race is tight , and apparently so are Obama ’s and Clinton ’s dance skills .
John McCain and Miss SC on US Economics
Uh , and such as , and things like world hunger …
The parody is way too close to spoof me .
Goods are more expensive in the UK compared with the US
Analyst Oxford Economics said the UK's GDP per head of population will reach £ 23,500 - £ 250 higher than in the US .
However , because goods and services are cheaper in the US , Americans will have stronger purchasing power , it added .
UK GDP per capita will also be higher than in Germany ( £ 21,665 ) and France ( £ 21,700 ) , Oxford Economics calculated .
Managing director Adrian Cooper said : " The last 15 years have seen a dramatic change in the UK 's economic performance and its position in the world economy .
" No longer are we the ' sick man of Europe ' . "
Oxford Economics said that in 1993 , following the last major recession and the UK's ejection from the ERM , GDP per capita in the UK was 34 % lower than in the US , 33 % lower than in Germany and 26 % lower than in France .
It said the improved UK position reflected the sustained strong growth it has enjoyed since then and the recent strength of sterling .
Mr Cooper said : " The UK has been catching up steadily with living standards in the US since 2001 , so it is a well - established trend rather than simply the result of currency fluctuations . "
As I mentioned before , after starting out the new job , in a new city , with a new language , and a new computer , I started playing with GNU Emacs editor .
I kind of staled with Vim , knew how to do stuff , but I was n’t feeling very pleased by Vimscript .
On the other hand I was reading good things about Emacs ( many of them in Steve Yegge blog and his Drunken Rants ) and always had some curiosity about Elisp .
At first I was using it just for playing at home , and kept using Vim at work , since my project was running at high speed and I was a little bit insecure — specially because I wanted to use a version from CVS that supported fancy Truetype fonts in the X11 environment .
After some time , I got confident enough to use it full - time , bootstrapped my .emacs file with Barbieri ’s .emacs plus minor modifications — funny thing is , for some reason I kept using Vim to edit my .emacs file for a few weeks .
Inside Emacs ’
M-x info library , there is a nice document , also available on the web , Programming in Emacs Lisp .
Nice because it explains Elisp but also how Emacs works at the same time — strongly recommended for those who are starting .
Another good resource is Yegge ’s Emergency Lisp , which is a good practical summary of the language .
During this process I kept talking to my friends about the new editor ( we were all Vim users ) and trying to push Emacs into them , too .
It worked for at least one of them .
He tried a bit , but missed some features from the editor he used to work , Textmate .
We both immediatly concluded : hey , Emacs should be able to do everything that Textmate did , and more .
So he found out about yasnippet that allowed the creation of mini-templates that are triggered by short strings and then using TAB ( yes , the guy has two blogs , do n’t ask me why ) .
I ended up trying to solve another problem , which is to automatically insert the closing parenthesis when you insert the opening ( abstract this to use with other interesting pairs of characters ) .
It was just using the existing skeleton - pair feature available in Emacs , with a few twists .
Show me the code
I ’ll comment on my solution , but you can also grab the raw file here .
By the way , I ’ve used M-x htmlize - buffer to create colorized pieces of code .
;; Paren experiment ( setq skeleton - pair t ) ( defvar my - skeleton - pair - alist '( ( ?\ ) . ?\( ) (?\ ] . ?\[ ) (?} . ?{ ) (? " . ? " ) ) )
First we needed to activate skeleton - pair .
It ’s part of skeleton - mode .
It allows you to type ( and get ( ) with the point ( also known as cursor ) positioned inside the parens .
Also allows you to selected a region and type ( , and the region will be inside the parens .
In this block we also create a helper association list , that we ’ll be using later .
( defun my - skeleton - pair - end ( arg ) " Skip the char if it is an ending , otherwise insert it . " ( interactive " * p " ) ( let ( ( char last - command - char ) ) ( if ( and ( assq char my - skeleton - pair - alist ) ( eq char ( following - char ) ) ) ( forward - char ) ( self - insert - command ( prefix - numeric - value arg ) ) ) ) )
First real thing is here .
We defined a function that accepts one argument .
The interactive tells us how we fill the arguments when the function is called via some key or key combination interactively .
At this moment it ’s nice to know that everything you type in Emacs will end up triggering some function .
Even simple characters .
When you type a , Emacs will look in a table and see what function it should call .
Normal letters like a are bound to the function self - insert - command .
Back to the function : it ’s body is very simple , if the character we typed ( given by the global last - command - char ) is one closing char present in our association list and the next character is the same , we just forward - char , otherwise , we add the character as usual .
The idea is to bind this function to the closing chars like ) and } .
That ’s what we do next :
( dolist ( pair my - skeleton - pair - alist ) ( global - set - key ( char - to - string ( first pair ) ) ' my - skeleton-pair-end ) ;;
If the char for begin and end is the same , ; ; use the original skeleton ( global - set - key ( char - to - string ( rest pair ) ) ' skeleton - pair - insert- maybe ) )
So when you type ( the function skeleton - pair - insert - maybe takes care , when you type ) our function will take care of the ending .
This gives the first feature over pure skeleton - pair : when you type ( and then ) you ’ll end up with the right thing ( ) instead of ( ) ) that the plain skeleton pair would give you .
After testing a bit , and showing to others , we realize : if I press ( and then backspace I would still have the ) hanging around .
Solutions ?
Well , let ’s rebind Backspace to be smart enough about that , right ?
Well , that ’s what I did at first : do my thing and call the original bind for backspace backward - delete - char - untabify .
It worked …
… except when some language mode rebinds backspace , like python - mode because it uses backspace also to walk thru the possible indentations in the code and we would break their binding .
And guess what ?
Lately I was coding mostly in Python .
After some research , a solution came up :
( defadvice backward - delete - char - untabify ( before my - skeleton - backspace activate ) " When deleting the beginning of a pair , and the ending is next char , delete it too . " ( let ( ( pair ( assq ( following - char ) my - skeleton - pair - alist ) ) ) ( and pair ( eq ( preceding - char ) ( rest pair ) ) ( delete-char 1 ) ) ) )
Short explanation : we say that this piece of code will run before backward - delete - char - untabify runs .
It does what we need : if we are calling backspace to delete an opening paren and the closing paren is right after , we delete the closing one .
After we run , the normal function will run and delete the opening one .
Now python - mode or any other mode can rebind backspace as they want , everytime they use the original function , our code will run .
And that ’s how we got the second feature ( smart backspace ) .
And that ’s it .
Actually after that , experimenting with other modes , like the cc-mode ( default for C/ C++ files ) , I discovered that the opening paren ( as other opening chars ) are binded to c-electric - paren to do indentation as you type .
I did n’t found an easy way to workaround this like in backspace , because the original function for ( is self - insert - char but making an advice for this function would make our code run lots and lots of times unnecessarily .
The other solution would be to create advices for the c-electric -* functions .
But since I ’m not using this smart parens when using C , I did n’t investigate further , so if you discover another clean way to do this , please tell me .
Conclusion
I hope this post could teach you something about Emacs .
The code I present here is not very important , but the concepts around it are , for example : the binding of keys to functions in Emacs , or how to improve functions by using defadvice .
Just knowing these concepts is already useful : later when you need something similar , you ’ll know where to look .
Even better , when solving a problem , you ’ll have new ideas on how to solve it .
I ’m still using this code , not sure for how long .
I can say it ’s useful when I ’m coding Python — with a few exception cases .
In other modes — like when typing normal text — the smart parens are not very useful for me , and in erc ( one way to use IRC inside Emacs ) they are even annoying , but that ’s just me .
If you try it , comments are welcome .
Also are welcome new ideas on how to deal with these problems .
Sour - grapes for Hillary Clinton , whose rotting cynicism is no match for Obama ’s sparkle .
There ’s no doubt that if politicians were wine – Hillary is vinegar and Obama is champagne .
How dare Senator Clinton come out against Senator Obama , after his over rated comments about small - town America being bitter , with a series of photo - opportunities , going through the motions with a camera crew in tow – and in one audacious clip , pausing to have a sip of beer and drink a shot !
Oh sure Hillary , you drink beer so that makes you working - class .
The idea that a certain product can dictate one ’s class is especially infuriating to a real wine - drinker , who recognizes wine ’s essentially humble and agricultural roots – much the same as beer .
That Clinton thinks that she can relate to the working class man with a photo - op drinking beer demonstrates that she is in fact far more derisory of the working class than she would dare let on .
Although Obama may be on record saying that people cling to guns and religion because of economic uncertainty ( which may not be entirely untrue ) , for Clinton to respond by taking a sip of beer and drinking a shot means that she thinks the best way to get the attention of the working class is to show an affinity for the bottle ( which is slanderous . )
Unwittingly , and thus tellingly , she implies that middle - class America are a bunch of drunks .
It is in follies like this that you can see the Rove - style politics at play , where there is power - play between the have ’s and have - nots and well - to - do senators descend into the unwashed masses for the photo - opportunities and a quick ego - boost .
However , with the recent Gallup ratings showing Obama ’s new lead , we can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that our man Obama will most certainly win in Pennsylvania tomorrow night .
What the Clinton coalition will never understand is that instead of being like a fine wine and maturing with age , they , ve gone sour .
Obama has the sparkle and fizz of youth , with the sophistication , complexity and dynamite of champagne .
Every time he finishes a speech one feels like celebrating and toasting the future , whilst Clinton ’s speeches do nothing more than make you want to imbibe ouzo .
Obama has a fight cut out for him , but I advise you go and buy some champagne today and have it at the ready to pop open tomorrow night : because 20 years from now , you ’ll want to be able to tell your children that that ’s what you did .
Essentially Obama has allowed every citizen to become part of the citizenry .
Unlike the last two elections where many Americans felt robbed .
Obama , through grass roots movements like An Obama Minute , his crowd surging rallies , online - community , and a winning coalition of tech - savvy , wine - drinking , young and able people the world over has been able to win countless hearts and minds .
Being an American president is not so much about experience , but more about being able to take big ideas , and like the epiphanies at the end of a symposium , make people excited about them .
And if it ’s inspiration America wants , I ’d recommend champagne over vinegar .

The dubious politics behind the Beijing Olympics protests
By David Walsh
10 April 2008
Significant protests in London , Paris and now San Francisco have threatened to disrupt the Olympic torch relay as it makes its way through cities on five continents preliminary to the summer games in Beijing in August .
At the center of the protests is the Chinese regime ’s repression in Tibet and its overall human rights record .
In addition to pro-Tibetan activists , a coalition of groups , including opponents of China ’s policies in Darfur and Burma , as well as persecuted religious sect Falun Gong supporters and animal rights movements , have organized the events .
In London and Paris , demonstrators attempted to snuff out the Olympic flame — succeeding several times — as it was carried through city streets .
In San Francisco several hundred protesters gathered Tuesday afternoon and a larger crowd assembled at a vigil that evening in the city ’s UN Plaza .
They were addressed by actor Richard Gere , Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and Richard Blum , multimillionaire financier husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( Democrat from California ) , among others .
A bigger protest was planned for Wednesday when the torch was to be actually conveyed along San Francisco ’s waterfront .
The anti-Chinese protests , which , while vociferous , have not mobilized massive numbers of participants , have received wide coverage in the US media .
It should simply be noted that vast worldwide demonstrations against American intervention in Iraq in February 2003 , which numbered in the millions , did not garner one - tenth the airtime or column space .
An effort is under way to organize a campaign against the Beijing Olympics along the same general lines as the boycott of the Moscow games in 1980 engineered by the Carter administration as a propaganda weapon , supposedly in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the year before .
Sixty - two countries bowed out of the 1980 games .
Four years later , in retaliation , the Stalinist bloc countries boycotted the Los Angeles Olympic games .
The American ruling elite is torn about the present campaign .
Powerful elements certainly appreciate the economic and financial significance of China to world capitalism and are reluctant to throw the full support of the state behind this .
The Bush administration has not joined the current effort wholeheartedly , at least not in public .
The Democrats in Congress , led by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , are making more noise about the issue .
Pelosi has called on George W. Bush to consider avoiding the opening ceremony in Beijing ; New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton , desperate to make waves in an effort to keep her presidential hopes alive , has appealed to Bush not to attend the opening .
The Democrats are attempting to stir up both the pots of anticommunism and anti-Chinese chauvinism .
For the moment , Bush has indicated his intention to be at the ceremony .
Gordon Brown , British prime minister , says he will not be at the opening , but not as a protest ; he plans to attend the closing ceremony .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will stay away from the opening and France ’s Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to do the same .
The campaign against the Beijing summer games , predictably , has become a political football , used for generally reactionary purposes .
The long - standing links between Tibetan nationalist forces and the Central Intelligence Agency , which financed , armed and helped instigate the 1959 uprising against Chinese rule , are common knowledge .
In the more recent period , CIA conduits like the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , set up by the Reagan administration in 1984 , have provided funds to Tibetan separatist movements .
Having said that , there is no reason whatsoever to express solidarity with Chinese repression in Tibet .
The Beijing regime has nothing to do with socialism or communism .
It has made the country available to predatory foreign and domestic corporate interests , who now exploit Chinese workers by the tens of millions at miserable wages .
This systematic rape by the ‘ free market ’ has made China home to one of the fastest - growing collections of billionaires in the world .
The Beijing government is deservedly hated by the population and responds to every serious protest with repression and violence .
The Chinese regime tramples on the democratic and social rights of the Tibetans as it does on the rights of the population as a whole .
The answer to that is not Tibetan nationalism ; separation , advocated by the Tibetan Youth Congress and other groups , would simply turn the newly ‘ independent ’ nation into an impotent pawn of this or that imperialist power and solve none of the democratic or social questions .
That the Dalai Lama , a symbol of feudal reaction and superstition , remains the spiritual leader of the nationalist movement speaks volumes about its social and class character .
No doubt genuine revulsion against Beijing ’s policies motivates some of the demonstrators in San Francisco and elsewhere .
However , an amorphous clamor about ‘ human rights ’ and ‘ atrocities ’ sweeps up a great many muddleheads , who never notice that their protests coincide with the general line of Great Power policy .
In the absence of an internationalist and socialist perspective , such a campaign can feed into maneuverings and interests that have nothing in common with human rights in Tibet .
We saw this play itself out in a tragic fashion in the Balkans in the 1990s , where a considerable section of the ‘ left ’ aligned itself with the anti-Serbian campaign .
This became an instrument for the carve - up of the Balkans in the interests of US and German imperialism .
Large historical questions are involved in the Tibet crisis , which may have quite unexpected and explosive consequences .
The same kind of operation , conducted by the US government in particular , has taken place in relation to Taiwan over the decades .
However legitimate the democratic strivings , the politics and perspective of the Taiwan independence movement are quite reactionary and play into the hands of reactionary elements .
In the long - term , such playing with fire by the Great Powers leads to war and mass suffering .
The only progressive response is a socialist policy , and the unification of the working population against imperialism and all its agencies .
The sort of politics behind the current campaign emerge in a statement from the International Committee for Tibet , one of those organizations that has received funding from the NED .
In an appeal for its April 8 vigil in San Francisco , the ICT urges Bush not to attend the opening ceremony , which “ will be used by the Chinese Communist Party as evidence of its legitimacy on the world stage and that the world is turning a blind eye to systematic human rights abuses throughout all of China .
President Bush , who considers himself to be ‘ the human rights President ’ should not associate himself with a political regime that systematically abuses the rights of its citizens . ”
One rubs one ’s eyes .
Bush , a major war criminal ( “ the human rights president ” ! ) , is being called on to disassociate himself from a regime that “ systematically abuses ” human rights .
He is the leading figure of such a regime .
The hypocrisy of US politicians over the Beijing Olympics is monumental .
In her statement , Hillary Clinton declared , “ I encourage the Chinese to take advantage of this moment as an opportunity to live up to universal human aspirations of respect for human rights and unity , ideals that the Olympic games have come to represent . ”
Pelosi added her two cents : “ Freedom - loving people around the world are vigorously protesting because of the crackdown in Tibet and Beijing ’s support for the regime in Sudan and the military junta in Burma .
The people are making a significant statement that the Olympic ideals of peace and harmony should apply to all people , including those in Tibet and Darfur . ”
For all their brutality and ruthlessness , the Chinese actions in Tibet do n’t begin to approach the horrors committed by the US government and military in Iraq .
More than one million Iraqis dead , millions more driven into exile , a country destroyed , four thousand US military personnel killed and tens of thousands physically or mentally maimed — at an estimated eventual cost of several trillion dollars .
American politicians , up to their elbows in blood , are in no position to lecture anyone about the “ universal human aspirations of respect for human rights and unity ” and “ the Olympic ideals of peace and harmony . ”
Democrats like Clinton and Pelosi have been complicit in the Iraqi sociocide from the beginning , and as the prostration of their party ’s representatives before Gen .
David Petraeus this week demonstrated , they continue to accept as legitimate the US drive for world domination , euphemistically known as the ‘ global war on terror . ’

CREDIT CARDS CREDIT CARDS
Find what you want :
Check rates and terms nationwide Even as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates , financial institutions have sharply raised rates for credit card customers — even those who pay on time — as they grapple with losses from other bad consumer loans .
This month , Washington Mutual ( WM ) told some credit card customers that it was raising their rates by as much as 100 % .
Discover ( DFS ) is lifting its penalty rate to 31 % , effective May 1 , and may apply that maximum to consumers who exceed their credit limit twice in a rolling 12 months .
Bank of America ( BAC ) raised rates for some customers in March — triple , in some cases , though spokeswoman Betty Riess says , " It would be very rare . "
All three institutions say they reserve the right to adjust rates when customers become higher risks .
Keith Givens , a spokesman for Washington Mutual , also notes that the decision to raise some rates is " an indicator of overall deterioration in the economy . "
As banks deal with tough business conditions , their definition of risk is evolving : " It 's a lot like beauty ; it 's in the eye of the beholder , " says Greg McBride , senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com .
That 's why even responsible consumers whose credit scores have n't changed are being hit , says Joseph Ridout , a spokesman for Consumer Action , an advocacy group .
Bill Hardekopf , CEO of LowCards.com , says the card comparison site is " seeing more aggressive fees come out , and issuers are quicker to change interest rates . "
He notes that as banks lose money on mortgage loans , it 's logical they would try to boost credit card profits .
" If one end of your business is suffering , you look to the other end to pick up the slack . "
To boost profits , some banks have also imposed higher fees on consumers for paying late , transferring credit card balances and withdrawing money from an ATM .
The danger for card holders is that as some struggle to pay bills , steep rate or fee increases could nudge them toward default .
Credit card delinquencies — a precursor to defaults — have been climbing , and overall consumer loan delinquencies are at their highest since 1992 .
" If every ( card company ) raises your rate , you might have to write the debt off or go into bankruptcy , " says Dan Blanton , of Pevely , Mo .
He was notified this month that his Washington Mutual credit card rate would nearly double , to 24 % .
Blanton calls the rate increase " totally unfair . "
He pays his credit card bills on time and generally pays more than the minimum due .
He also has a solid credit score of nearly 700 , he says .
( Washington Mutual says it does n't comment on individual accounts . )
Discover 's new penalty rate applies to all new customers .
About 10 % of existing customers could also be hit with the 31 % rate if they miss a payment or exceed their credit limit twice in a year .
Bank of America and Washington Mutual declined to say what percentage of their existing customer base would be hit with higher interest rates .

Some banks are raising their rates on cards significantly to make up for losses from bad loans .

Fasting for two days protects healthy cells against chemotherapy , according to a study appearing online the week of Mar. 31 in PNAS Early Edition .
Mice given a high dose of chemotherapy after fasting continued to thrive .
The same dose killed half the normally fed mice and caused lasting weight and energy loss in the survivors .
The chemotherapy worked as intended on cancer , extending the lifespan of mice injected with aggressive human tumors , reported a group led by Valter Longo of the University of Southern California .
Test tube experiments with human cells confirmed the differential resistance of normal and cancer cells to chemotherapy after a short period of starvation .
Making chemotherapy more selective has been a top cancer research goal for decades .
Oncologists could control cancers much better , and even cure some , if chemotherapy were not so toxic to the rest of the body .
Experts described the study as one of a kind .
“ This is a very important paper .
It defines a novel concept in cancer biology , ” said cancer researcher Pinchas Cohen , professor and chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of California , Los Angeles .
“ In theory , it opens up new treatment approaches that will allow higher doses of chemotherapy .
It ’s a direction that ’s worth pursuing in clinical trials in humans . ”
Felipe Sierra , director of the Biology of Aging Program at the National Institute on Aging , said : “ This is not just one more anti-cancer treatment that attacks the cancer cells .
To me , that ’s an important conceptual difference . ”
Sierra was referring to decades of efforts by thousands of researchers working on “ targeted delivery ” of drugs to cancer cells .
Study leader Longo focused instead on protecting all the other cells .
Sierra added that progress in cancer care has made patients more resilient and able to tolerate fasting , should clinical trials confirm its usefulness .
“ We have passed the stage where patients arrive at the clinic in an emaciated state .
Not eating for two days is not the end of the world , ” Sierra said .
“ This could have applicability in maybe a majority of patients , ” said David Quinn , a practicing oncologist and medical director of USC Norris Hospital and Clinics .
He predicted that many oncology groups would be eager to test the Longo group ’s findings , and advised patients to look for a clinical trial near home .
Longo , an anti-aging researcher who holds joint appointments in gerontology and biological sciences at USC , said that the idea of protecting healthy cells from chemotherapy may have seemed impractical to cancer researchers , because the body has many different cells that respond differently to many drugs .
“ It was almost like an idea that was not even worth pursuing .
In fact it had to come from the anti-aging field , because that ’s what we focus on : protecting all cells at once , ” Longo said .
“ What really was missing was a perspective of someone from the aging field to give this field a boost , ” UCLA ’s Cohen said .
The idea for the study came from the Longo group ’s previous research on aging in cellular systems , primarily lowly baker ’s yeast .
About five years ago , Longo was thinking about the genetic pathways involved both in the starvation response and in mammalian tumors .
When the pathways are silenced , starved cells go into what Longo calls a maintenance mode characterized by extreme resistance to stresses .
In essence the cells are waiting out the lean period , much like hibernating animals .
But tumors by definition disobey orders to stop growing because the same genetic pathways are stuck in an “ on ” mode .
That could mean , Longo realized , that the starvation response might differentiate normal and cancer cells by their stress resistance , and that healthy cells might withstand much more chemotherapy than cancer cells .
The shield for healthy cells does not need to be perfect , Longo said .
What matters is the difference in stress resistance between healthy and cancerous cells .
During the study , conducted both at USC and in the laboratory of Lizzia Raffaghello at Gaslini Children ’s Hospital in Genoa , Italy , the researchers found that current chemotherapy drugs kill as many healthy mammalian cells as cancer cells .
“ ( But ) we reached a two to five - fold difference between normal and cancer cells , including human cells in culture .
More importantly , we consistently showed that mice were highly protected while cancer cells remained sensitive , ” Longo said .
If healthy human cells were just twice as resistant as cancer cells , oncologists could increase the dose or frequency of chemotherapy .
“ We were able to reach a 1,000 - fold differential resistance using a tumor model in baker ’s yeast .
If we get to just a 10 - 20 fold differential toxicity with human metastatic cancers , all of a sudden it ’s a completely different game against cancer , ” Longo said .
“ Now we need to spend a lot of time talking to clinical oncologists to decide how to best proceed in the human studies . ”
Edith Gralla , a research professor of chemistry at UCLA , said : “ It is the sort of opposite of the magic bullet .
It ’s the magic shield . ”

Tholos of Athena — TENTH ADDRESS TO CITY COUNCIL ( Re : A Resolution To Impeach )
April 1 , 2008
Mayor , Council members , I appear for the tenth time asking you to pass a simple resolution calling for the impeachment of the President and Vice President of the United States .
In my remarks awhile back , I raised the question of whether you take seriously your oath to defend the Constitution .
At which you seemed to take offence .
The Mayor spoke for you , so I assume you were all equally offended .
We ’re all familiar with the husband who loudly protests his allegiance to his wife and children , but then fails to show up when those who depend on him need him most .
And it seems to me that now is one of those times in the life of our Constitution .
. . when those who have sworn to defend her can show how seriously they take that oath .
Or not .
I think it ’s safe to say that we are in the midst of a Constitutional crisis .
That ’s how the Watergate era is typically described , and there is no question that the abuses of power of the current regime far surpass those for which Nixon was impeached .
There ’s a new film now called Taxi To The Dark Side , about an Afghan taxi driver tortured to death by our military .
The film has won numerous awards , including an Oscar for best documentary film .
This man , this taxi driver , it turns out , was probably innocent of any crime .
The film also shows that this was no isolated incident .
Over one hundred prisoners have died in suspicious circumstances while in U.S. custody during the war on terror .
We know people have been tortured at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and other places around the world .
Meanwhile , on March 8 , George W. Bush became the first American President to use the veto power to preserve the right to torture .
And that is just one item on a list that includes warrantless wiretapping of citizens , lying to Congress and the American people , invading a sovereign country for no apparent reason .
You say you take seriously your oath to protect the Constitution , and , again , all I can say is I ca n’t imagine a better opportunity to demonstrate the truth of that statement .
It ’s easy to get mad at me .
The question is why you should find it so difficult to be outraged at those in high places who threaten our Constitution and subvert the rule of law .
Having said that , I wish to add that I have only the utmost respect for all of you and the work that you perform here .
It ’s only because I happen to hold in such high regard your sense of morality and integrity that I bother to come down here at all , and why , even now , I find it so difficult to accept that this cause is hopeless .
Thank you .
The brain 's limbic system was stimulated
A team of doctors in Canada stumbled upon the finding while attempting to treat a morbidly obese man through deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) .
The electrical stimulation caused the patient to experience vivid memories .
The findings , reported in the Annals of Neurology , potentially pave the way for electrical stimulation to treat disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease .
We hope it might provide benefit to patients with memory disorders
Andres Lozano
Toronto Western Hospital
Lead researcher Professor Andres Lozano , of the Toronto Western Hospital , said : " This is a single case that was totally unexpected .
" We knew immediately this was important .
We are sufficiently intrigued to see if this could help people with memory disorders . "
The team had been trying to help a 50 - year - old obese man with type 2 diabetes and sleeping disorders who had failed to respond to diet , medications and psychological help .
He had refused gastric surgery , and doctors decided deep brain stimulation , although experimental , was his best option .
DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION
Electrodes are implanted in the brain under local anaesthesia , with the patient awake so their responses can be monitored
The electrodes are stimulated by a " pacemaker " stitched into the chest
It has been used for more than a decade to treat tremor , and more recently to treat Parkinson 's disease , chronic pain and depression Side effects can include apathy , hallucinations , depression , and even compulsive gambling - but often they are temporary
It has been found to have an impact on appetite in animal tests , but has not been widely tested as a treatment for obesity in humans .
However , it has been used to treat Parkinson 's disease , chronic pain , severe cluster headaches and even depression with some success .
The technique involves implanting electrodes into the brain : in this case into an area in the limbic system called the hypothalamus , which is thought to control the appetite .
When the electrodes were stimulated by electrical impulses the patient began to experience feelings of deja vu .
He then had a sudden perception of being in a park with friends .
He felt younger , thought he was around 20 - years - old , and his girlfriend of the time was there .
He was an observer , and saw the scene in colour .
As the intensity of the stimulation increased , details in the scene became more vivid .
Memory tests
Following surgery , the patient recovered for two months .
But later when the electrodes were stimulated for a second time , he experienced a similar effect .
After three weeks of constant electrical stimulation the patient performed better in memory tests than he had previously done .
A year later he again performed well in memory tests when the electrodes were stimulated , but less well when they were switched off .
The results suggest it might be possible to use deep brain stimulation directly to boost memory .
" We hopefully have found a circuit in the brain which can be modulated by stimulation , and which might provide benefit to patients with memory disorders , " said Professor Lozano .
Professor Lozano is now leading a pilot study into whether deep brain stimulation can help people with early Alzheimer 's disease .
They are initially testing six patients .
Susanne Sorensen , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " As it is difficult to experiment on the living human brain , big leaps in understanding have occasionally been made from unexpected results when treating something unrelated or observations from rare genetic diseases and unusual lesions .
" The observations of memories recovery made during this attempt to treat extreme obesity , could be just such a ' stroke of luck ' . "
Rebecca Wood , Chief Executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , welcomed the move but said further work was clearly needed .
She said : " It will be interesting to see whether this method offers any benefit to people with Alzheimer's .
" With the number of people with Alzheimer 's forecast to double within a generation , we urgently need to find ways to tackle this awful disease , but research is hugely under - funded . "
BANGLADESH , WOMEN AND DEMOCRACY
By
Janice G. Raymond
Most of South Asia ’s female leaders have ended up dead or in detention .
Indira Gandhi , Aung San Suu Kyi , Benazir Bhutto and now , in Bangladesh , former Prime Ministers , Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wazed .
January , 2008 marked the one year anniversary of a state of emergency in Bangladesh .
The recent history of Bangladesh , the former East Pakistan , is what some have called the “ Pakistanization ” of the country : a military - backed government , a judiciary under siege , the suspension of democratic values and the imprisoning of former Prime Ministers .
In January , 2007 , after violent clashes between political parties in the streets , a military - controlled civilian caretaker government was installed promising elections within several months , which have not yet been held .
Fundamental rights and freedoms were suspended , including massive arrests without warrant , deprivation of bail , and the setting up of special courts .
A Special Powers
Act imposed a ban on political activities , applied also to in - house meetings of four persons , designated as “ indoor politics . ”
There have been considerable numbers of detentions -- by some estimates , 250,000 or more – and many reports of custodial torture .
Women continue to be the victims of extreme forms of violence and sexual exploitation .
Rape and acid violence are common .
As the June 2007 US State Department ’s annual Trafficking in Persons Report noted , Bangladesh continues to be a source and transit country for trafficking in women and children , most trafficked into sexual slavery in India and Pakistan .
The present government ’s unwritten policy of “ Minus Two ” has put the major blame for the corrupt and chaotic politics of Bangladesh squarely on the shoulders of its two former Prime Ministers , Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wazed , who have traded power for the last 15 years .
In an attempt to “ disappear ” these women from any future political leadership role , the government implemented its “ minus the two begums ( ladies ) ” goal by attempting to prevent Sheikh Hasina from returning to the country and force Khaleda Zia into exile in Saudi Arabia .
Hasina demanded that she be allowed to return , and Zia refused to leave .
Odhikar , a prominent Bangladeshi human rights organization that publishes frequent reports on Bangladesh , has noted the simplistic “ anti- women politics ” of singularly blaming these two leaders for the political , social and economic problems of Bangladesh .
The intractable problems of the country have , in fact , been dominated by the costly failures of development agendas , the challenges faced by a young and struggling democracy , and the endemic poverty of the country .
It remains to be seen whether the two begums will be blamed for Bangladesh ’s recurring catastrophic floods !
As representatives of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women ( CATW ) , I and a colleague traveled to Bangladesh several weeks ago on a fact - finding mission occasioned by the arrest , jailing and sentencing of Sigma Huda .
Huda is the former head of our organization there , and a well - known human rights lawyer and activist .
Huda ’s health problems are multiple and major , and her physician has stated that she is at “ imminent risk of death . ”
Huda was sentenced in August , 2007 to a three year jail term on charges of aiding and abetting the alleged corruption of her husband , Nazmul , a former Minister of Parliament and cabinet minister .
Many wives of prominent politicians have been jailed as accomplices in their husbands ’ alleged wrongdoing .
In Sigma Huda ’s case , however , she is a national and international force in her own right .
Long a topnotch lawyer who has been willing to challenge powerful institutions in the society , including abuses occurring under her husband ’s government , she has also waged legal battle with corruption in the police .
For the last three years , she has been the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons .
In an apparent twist of her fate , she stands condemned as an appendage of her husband ’s alleged crimes .
But it appears that Sigma Huda is being additionally penalized because she has been an independent and outspoken woman with the international standing to spotlight the abuses of the current Bangladeshi regime .
Disparate treatment can be illustrated by comparing the custodial environment of Nazmul to that of Sigma .
Nazmul has his own room , an area where he can walk and exercise , sanitary facilities and the society of other male prisoners with whom he is allowed to converse .
In contrast , Sigma is incarcerated in filthy conditions in a common area with multiple women who share one toilet that constantly overflows , has no space to walk , and cannot talk at length with other women .
Bangladesh has persistent problems .
It is the most corrupt country in the world .
However , the western embassies in Bangladesh seem to have endorsed this government ’s fiction of fighting corruption by using the most repressive measures .
Meaningful reforms cannot happen when due process is suspended , or when the courts are politicized .
The current government has violated human rights and allowed political extremism in the form of velvet - gloved militarism to strengthen its hold on the country .
The situation of women in Bangladesh is emblematic of the regime ’s widespread repression of the democratic process .
Sources indicate that the CBC is set to become the first major North American broadcaster to freely release one of its programs without DRM using BitTorrent .
This Sunday , CBC will air Canada Next Great Prime Minister .
The following day , it plans to freely release a high - resolution version via peer - to - peer networks without any DRM restrictions .
This development is important not only because it shows that Canada 's public broadcaster is increasingly willing to experiment with alternative forms of distribution , but also because it may help crystallize the net neutrality issue in Canada .
The CBC 's mandate , as provided in the Broadcasting Act , requires it to make its programming " available throughout Canada by the most appropriate and efficient means . "
Using BitTorrent allows the CBC to meet its statutory mandate , yet with ISPs such as Rogers engaging in non-transparent traffic shaping , millions of Canadians may be unable to fully access programming funded by tax dollars .
If the CBC experiment is successful , look for more broadcasters to do the same and for the CRTC to face mounting pressure to address net neutrality concerns .

What are you going to do ?
Bleed on me ?
Well , what an interesting week it has been .
And here at The News Conduit , we ’ve not only been covering the popular stories , but also those stories that are slightly off - center .
Here ’s a summary of the top 10 news stories you did n’t hear about this week :
1 ) Anyone up for a peroxide enema ?
17 tourists in the spa town of Yessentuki ( in Russia ) were treated to enemas of hydrogen peroxide instead of water , and all 17 had to be admitted to hospital after the mix - up .
Apparently the mix - up occurred because water and hydrogen peroxide look the same , which has led us at TNC to speculate that pure - alcohol , nail polish remover , and lemonade enemas will be offered to customers in the future – a move which will surely make the monotous process of having an enema a tad more exciting .
One thing is certain , however – at least the tourists who received the hydrogen peroxide ( one of the common chemicals used to bleach hair ) enemas will have the whitest GI tracts seen in intestinal history .

2 ) Taking pre-orders to a new level
British man Andy Lees , 71 years - old , and with only six months to live , paid a funeral company for his service and headstone .
What he did n’t expect was that his headstone would be erected before he had passed away .
He became concerned after many of his friends begain calling him to check whether he was dead or not after seeing the headstone in its place at the cemetary .
So much was the shock for Mr. Lees , that his legs started to shake and he had to be taken home after visiting the cemetary to view his pre-emptive headstone .
We at TNC think that this is a great idea , however , and should be extended further for all terminally - ill patients .
Perhaps a conveyer - belt that extends from the window of the hospital ward to the six - feet - deep hole in the ground at the cemetary , to make the burial process as efficient as possible ?
Curiously , the headstone did n’t contain Mr. Lees date of death .

3 ) The dangers of eating on the job
Taking a few minutes extra on your lunch break is something we all do , but if you ’re a thief , eating while you ’re working is n’t such a good idea .
A man in Germany has been caught after the German authorities used a tiny piece of DNA that the man left on a half - eaten piece of salami at the crime scene ( a workshop office in the western city of Darmstadt ) .
We at TNC think that the age - old advice of , “ If you ’re hungry , have something to eat before you leave the house , ” obviously is n’t being taught these days .
However , this does have a positive side , as many companies in Germany are now starting to advertise a “ Salami Thief Catcher ” that you leave around the house to be half - eaten by any crooks that enter your home .

4 ) New campaign tactics a possible backfire ?
A mailer for Dean Hrbacek ’s , a congressional candidate ’s , campaign has been exposed as nothing more than Hrbacek ’s head spliced onto a thinner body .
The campaign manager explained that due to Hrbacek ’s busy schedule , he did n’t have time to pose for a full - length shot , and so his head was “ photoshopped ” onto the body .
Of course , this kind of tactic may backfire with voters , but we at TNC think this idea could be extended further .
Perhaps a picture of the head of presidential nominees on the body of an octopus to represent that they can handle many tasks at once ?
Or maybe on the body of a lion , to represent bravery ?
The possibilities are virtually endless .

5 ) How to smuggle a lion – almost
What would you do if you were living in the Gaza strip , and a section of the wall was destroyed , allowing you to travel through to the other side ?
Perhaps you ’d visit loved ones , or maybe you ’d stock up on that particular brand of peanut butter that you like but none of the shops in your country seem to sell .
Or maybe you ’d buy a lion and a monkey and try to smuggle them back across the border .
What ?
That ’s exactly what a Palestinian man tried to do earlier this week , and almost succeeded .
The man claimed he wanted to sell the lion cub and monkey in Gaza , but we at TNC think otherwise .
He obviously wanted to breed them together to create a super monkey - lion crossbreed that would take over the world , as you do .

6 ) They just do n’t build them like they used to , or do they ?
An iPhone has spent an hour on a busy highway , ending the ordeal after the owner watched a semi- trailer run over it before retrieving the unit .
The amazing thing , however , is that the iPhone has lived to tell the tale .
Although it has quite alot of scratches on it , the screen and touch - sensitive controls still perform the same as they did before the incident .
This is worrying news for the team here at TNC .
If an iPhone can survive that , what happens when it gets imbued with artificial intelligence ?
Something similiar to the scenario in the film “ I , Robot ” , we suspect .
As precaution , we would recommend destroying all copies of the movie , in case an iPhone accidentally sees it and starts to formulate it ’s own plan …

7 ) A close shave ahead for some Mexicans
In a bid to stop irresponsible driving in Northern Mexico , a variety of laws have been enacted , making it illegal to shave , put on lipstick , or carry a pet while driving .
( These come in addition to the good ‘ol regulars , such as drinking and driving and talking on a cell phone . )
Of course , this move has caused considerable outrage within the TNC team .
We ca n’t help but wonder – if you were n’t meant to shave or put lipstick on in your car then why does it have mirrors ?
And if you ’re not allowed to have pets on your lap , who ’s supposed to drive home when you ’re drunk ?

8 ) More than just a good night ’s sleep
Woolworths stores in London have withdrawn from sale a line of beds named Lolita that were designed for six - year - old girls after furious parents pointed out the link between the name of the bed and a classic novel in which the protagonist becomes sexually involved with his twelve - year - old stepdaughter .
How this was not brought to the attention of anyone at Woolworths ’ before the “ Lolita Midsleeper Combi ” was released has baffled us here at TNC .
But we ’re quite sure that some other lines of beds , such as the “ Awkward Teenage Moments Bunkbed ” and the “ Pregnancy King Size ” will probably be withdrawn from sale as well .

9 ) Just broke up with your partner ?
Have some time off work !
A Japanese business firm has offered employees “ heartache leave ” , so they can “ cry themselves out and return to work refreshed ” after a break - up .
But how old you are also determines the number of days that you can have off .
If you ’re younger than 24 , you only receive one day a year ; 25 to 29 and you get two days ; over 29 and you get to take three days off .
This is because the older you are , the tougher it is to find love , according to the company CEO .
The employees at the company also get two mornings off twice a year as “ sales shopping leave . ”
Here at TNC , we think that Hime & Company , and it ’s CEO Miki Hiradate have some great ideas , but would like to see some more ways to take days off from work .
“ Crying over spilt milk ” , “ Just feeling a bit depressed ” , and “ I ’m so high on drugs from the party I went to last night that I could n’t possibly work ” days are just a few of the options we brainstormed .

10 ) A chance to strike back at speed cameras
Sick to death of being caught by speed cameras ?
Wish there was something you could do about it ?
Well , now there is .
A businessman in Britain is offering motorists an opportunity to not only drive a 17 - tonne tank , but to run over and blow up a speed camera in the process .
Not surprisingly , customers will have to pay for the experience , but can you really put a price on getting the chance to crush a speed camera ?
We at TNC think that you can’t , and that ’s why we believe that this entrepreneur should expand his business plans to include a variety of different scenarios .
Tired of waiting for cattle or goats to cross the road when you ’re driving through the country ?
Get a tank and drive over them !
Hate the traffic jams that you must endure every peak hour ?
Wish that lollipop lady would n’t walk out in front of you just as you come to the crossing ?
You guessed it , get a tank and roll right over !

The Bush administration likes to think of itself as nuclear policeman to the world .
North Korea ?
Put those missiles back in your pants .
Iraq ?
Wipe that nuclear smirk off your face .
Iran ?
We do n't like the look on your face either -- no nuclear power for you .
Bush & Co. have gotten North Korea to shut down its reactor .
But they can't take credit for shuttering Iraq 's nuclear labs -- Bush 41's Gulf war convinced Saddam to do that .
Still there 's no doubt that they 've delayed Iran 's nuclear evolution .
Never mind any irregularities inherent in our initiatives toward Iran .
Such as denying it the nuclear fuel it 's guaranteed by Article IV of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty .
Or putting the fear of God into European diplomats by showing them plans for a nuclear warhead designed to fit on a missile with just enough thrust to reach Europe .
Those schematics were downloaded from a laptop smuggled out of Iran .
So what if the laptop 's chain of custody suffers from not one , but two broken links , that leave it open to charges the documents were fabricated ?
But people who live in glass houses should n't throw stones .
The administration 's heart is in the right place when it comes to halting the spread of nuclear weapons .
It 's just that to Bush & Co. , that means keeping them from countries we do n't like while making only token efforts to draw down our own .
Not only do we retain several thousand warheads , we 've modernized our nuclear arsenal with modulated , dialed - down " tactical " nukes .
Why , they 're almost like conventional bombs .
Look ma , no nuclear stigma .
Apparently the nuclear taboo has been shattered as well .
The nuclear posture review drawn up by the administration in 2001 provides for first use of nukes ( albeit the new tacticals ) -- hitherto unthinkable -- in awkward tasks like bunker busting .
Then there 's our NATO strategy : Eastward ho , stopping just long enough in the Czech Republic and Poland to set up missile defense installations .
Equally frightening , five of the west 's distinguished -- until now anyway -- military officers and strategists composed a manifesto calling on NATO to reserve the right to use nukes preemptively .
Way to channel General Curtis LeMay , guys .
Adding insult to proliferative injury are Sibel Edmonds 's revelations .
She claims that foreign intelligence agents successfully enlisted the support of US officials in positioning moles in our military and in our nuclear institutions .
Which is worse ?
The senior State Department official that Ms. Edmonds alleges was paid by Turkish agents for nuclear secrets to be sold on the black market to countries like Pakistan ?
Or how the FBI 's investigation into this affair has been hamstrung by the executive branch ?
Other treaties which we have n't done right by , besides the NPT , include the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , from which we withdrew , and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , which we oppose .
Perhaps the signature indicator of our disdain for the NPT , though , is the blind eye we turn to states that refused to sign it , like Israel , Pakistan and India , as they developed nuclear weapons .
Then , in December 2006 , Congress approved the United States - India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act to provide India with additional nuclear energy .
An untrained observer can't help but wonder if India uses so much uranium for weapons it needs more for peaceful use .
In any event , due to pressure from the communist party in India -- thank goodness for small favors -- that deal looks DOA .
Returning to Iran and the NPT , heed Kaveh Afrasiabi on Asia Times Online : " The continuation of the present ' coercive ' course of action against Iran by Washington will neither solve the Iran nuclear crisis nor improve the semi-crisis that the NPT finds itself in today ; rather , it will augment both . "
In another piece he cautions the International Atomic Energy Agency against succumbing to the blandishments of Bush & Co .
It " must stay firm on the rules of game and consider the fact that any overstepping of its bounds -- eg , by pressuring Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program in spite of Iran 's legal rights and its nuclear transparency -- will definitely backfire against the agency and , indeed , the entire non-proliferation regime . "
[ Emphasis added . ]
The aforementioned Article IV giving signatories the right to nuclear fuel was ratified when nuclear reactor fuel was less readily converted to an explosive .
Considered the NPT's " loophole , " it 's now the administration 's excuse to neglect the whole treaty .
In truth , we just do n't want to feel hemmed in when seeking nuclear deals with nations like India that have n't signed the NPT .
More to the point , we ourselves have no intention of disarming according to its dictates .
As with all international agreements , the administration would prefer to see the NPT shredded .
But the NPT , however threadbare , is one of our few forms of protection from a nuclear hellstorm , as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed calls it .
Nonproliferation can even prevent a nuclear attack by terrorists since their source for bombs is , of necessity , a state .
Behold this illustration of the NPT 's importance .
The Arab league just announced that if Israel should declare , as it's periodically pressured to , that it's in possession of a nuclear arsenal , the NPT 's Arab signatories would walk away from the treaty .
Even the illusion that the NPT works is enough .

This was a triumph .
I 'm making a note here : HUGE SUCCESS .
It 's hard to overstate my satisfaction .
Aperture Science :
We do what we must because we can .
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead .
( Chorus 1 )
But there 's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive .
I 'm not even angry .
I 'm being so sincere right now .
Even though you broke my heart and killed me .
And tore me to pieces .
And threw every piece into a fire .
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you .
( Chorus 2 )
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we 're out of beta we 're releasing on time .
So I 'm GLaD I got burned think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive .
Go ahead and leave me .
I think I prefer to stay inside .
Maybe you 'll find someone else to help you .
Maybe Black Mesa -
THAT WAS A JOKE .
HA HA , FAT CHANCE .
Anyway , this cake is great :
It 's so delicious and moist .
( Chorus 3 )
Look at me still talking when there 's science to do .
When I look out there it makes me GLaD I 'm not you .
I 've experiments to run there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive
And believe me I am still alive .
I 'm doing science and I 'm still alive .
I feel FANTASTIC and I 'm still alive .
While you 're dying I 'll be still alive .
And when you 're dead I will be still alive .
Still alive
Still alive
William " the Bloody " Kristol gets rewarded with a gig by the NY Times for being a neocon --- warmongering --- psycho .
The MMSSSMMM RULES !
Check out C&L's awesome video archives to see the madness that is " Kristol "
Here 's David Sirota 's response via email :
This is really sick - especially when you consider it is happening at a time when the country is clearly moving more progressive , and there are so many good progressive columnists who have guest columned for the Times before ( Ehrenreich , Katha Pollit , Tom Frank , etc. ) .
Either way - it is an absolute abomination from the standpoint of basic accountability .
A pundit being factually wrong on almost everything he hung his hat on is rewarded by the largest newspaper in the world for his track record .
If ever there was an example of the world of journalism literally thumbing its nose at basic accountability , this example of Bill Kristol falling up is it .
Well said , David !
Three detectives were found not guilty Friday on all charges in the shooting death of Sean Bell , who died in a hail of 50 police bullets outside a club in Jamaica , Queens , in November 2006 .
The verdict prompted calls for calm from the mayor , angry promises of protests by those speaking for the Bell family and expressions of relief by the detectives .
Detective Michael Oliver , who fired 31 bullets the night of the shooting and faced manslaughter charges , said Justice Arthur J. Cooperman had made a “ fair and just decision . ”
Justice Cooperman delivered the verdict in State Supreme Court at 9 a.m .
Describing the evidence , he said it was reasonable for the detectives to fear that someone in the crowd that night carried a gun .
He added that many of the prosecution ’s witnesses , including Mr. Bell ’s friends and the two wounded victims , were simply not believable .
“ At times , the testimony of those witnesses just did n’t make sense , ” the judge said .
Several supporters of Mr. Bell stormed out of the courtroom , and a few small scuffles followed outside the courthouse .
By midafternoon , there were no suggestions of any broader unrest around the city .
Mr. Bell ’s family and fiancée left without making any comments and drove to visit his grave at the Nassau Knolls Cemetery and Memorial Park in Port Washington .

In the past , Google Product Search just showed you results but did not group stores offering to sell the same product with reviews and technical specifications .

For example , a search on iphone shows many results , but now there is a button to “ Compare Prices . ”
When you click on the result , you are taken to a page that shows the prices by the stores Google grouped together , with store reviews :

The efforts of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to differentiate themselves on the issue of gun ownership has been , like so many of their efforts to differentiate themselves , a kind of off - key opera buffa .
Does Obama support individual ownership or a universal ban ?
Does Clinton really believe law - abiding citizens should be allowed to own guns ?
Do either of them believe the right of self - defense is anything but a quaint conceit ?
Are Second Amendment stalwarts right to view this as a choice between one gun grabber and another ?
Richard Feldman , author of Ricochet ; Confessions of a Gun Lobbyist , hips us to an obscure but telling difference in how the two candidates view these issues .
It involves law - abiding citizens , shades into self - defense in its most elemental form and arguably reveals a great deal about how the two view the use of force — that is , the use of force against law - abiding citizens by the state .
And there 's a clear distinction .
I give you Vitter Amdendment No. 4615 , which was voted on in the U.S. Senate at 6:13 PM on July 13 , 2006 .
Here 's the text :
To prohibit the confiscation of a firearm during an emergency or major disaster if the possession of such firearm is not prohibited under Federal or State law .
The amendment , which was attached to a Homeland Security appropriations package , was approved 84 - 16 .
The bill itself was signed into law in October 2006 .
If the confiscation issue seems recondite , set your wayback machine to the post - Hurricane Katrina period , when wild and largely inaccurate tales of disaster - area pillage gave way to revelations about how incompetent police chief Eddie Compass and other authorities eventually went about pacifying the Big Easy .
In particular , some footage of cops manhandling Patty Konie — an elderly resident seen holding ( by the barrel ) a revolver that looked like something that would have blown up in Wild Bill Hickock 's tiny hands — provided a shock even to those who do n't normally get excited about such matters .
This was the context in which the Vitter amendment was introduced .
Here is how the Democratic front - runners voted :
Clinton ( D - NY ) , Nay Obama ( D - IL ) , Yea
Neither campaign has responded to my request for more information on their votes and decision - making processes .
Will update if they do .
There 's an old tension here between individual rights and the need to establish ( by force ) police supremacy in a chaotic and dangerous situation .
That question dates back to frontier times , or at least to George Romero 's The Crazies , and it 's not one we can answer here .
But post - Katrina weapons confiscation did provide some pretty clear choices :
If you really think legally owned handguns were degrading , or in any other way influencing , the security situation in New Orleans in 2005 , you 've got your ideology where your common sense ought to be .
And if you do n't believe in the right to bear arms to protect your life and home during a days - long period when the authorities are nowhere to be seen , well , how can you say you believe in that right at all ?
Sri Lanka to introduce one laptop per child By Bandula Sirimanna Two - million primary school children are to be provided with US $ 100 - worth laptops under a farsighted initiative .
This is being launched by One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) , a US based organisation in collaboration with the Education Department and several local and foreign financial , technological and academic institutions .
Director OLPC Europe , Middle East and Asia Matt Keller , in an interview with The Sunday Times FT , said the World Bank has stepped into fund a pilot project to introduce laptops as an educational tool in nine provinces in the island .
OLPC Lanka Foundation has been set up to implement this massive education project aimed at supplying this learning tool into rural children ’s hands .
This foundation will coordinate the logistical challenges in getting the project off the ground .
If the government fully endorses the project , the non-profit foundation may be able to import the laptops duty - free , Keller said .
He added that Sri Lankan children in most remote rural areas will be given the opportunity to explore their own potential , to be exposed to innovative ideas , and to contribute to a more productive world community .
He pointed out that Sri Lanka ’s Education Ministry is also considering including the ‘ Laptop ’( project ) into its primary education programme with private sector assistance .
This Laptop per child which operates on less than a watt of energy has a one gigabyte memory , and a battery life of 15 hours .
These laptops could also be operated using solar power .
Its built - in wireless capability can detect networks up to three kilometers away , the laptop is called the XO and it embodies the theories of constructionism first developed by MIT Media lab Professor Symour Papert in the 1960 ’s , and later elaborated upon by Alan Kay , complemented by the principals articulated by Nicholas Negroponte in his book , Being Digital .
OLPC is committed to getting the XO into the hands of hundreds of millions of children within the next seven years .
Its unique mesh - net working system will allow many children to communicate instantaneously with each in their own communities and across the world .
Keller said that the lack of ready Internet access in many parts of rural Sri Lanka will not prevent children in the vicinity from sharing ideas , designs , concepts , or simply chatting with each other through their computers .
This is because the laptops can talk to each other through a “ mesh ” over a fairly long distance , he said .
He added that users also have access to a Linux - based text editing programme , an e-book reader , drawing , painting and music composition tools , and an in - built video camera .
BREAKING : Dean wants closure by July 1
A potential game - changer from CBS News and " The Early Show . "
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean says he wants superdelegates to make a decision by JULY 1 -- the most specific he has been in his effort to prod the party to decide between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton before the Democratic National Convention in late August .
Harry Smith asked if after the nominating contests end with the South Dakota and Montana primaries on June 3 , " Do you want the superdelegates to have some sort of vote immediately so that you 'll know months in advance of the convention what the outcome is ? ”
Dean replied : “ Well , I think the superdelegates have already been weighing in .
I think that there 's 800 of them and 450 of them have already said who they 're for .
I 'd like the other 350 to say who they 're at some point between now and the first of July so we do n't have to take this into the convention . ”
An aide explains that July 1 is not a drop - dead deadline : " The point is before the convention , ideally in June . "
Dean has been criticized for not taking a heavier hand in ending the bruising contest .
The aide elaborates on the chairman 's thinking : " Dean is personally engaged in this process , he 's had numerous conversations with over 60 leaders inside and outside of the Democratic Party , to hear their thoughts , get their input and encourage them to help reinforce the importance of keeping the party united behind our nominee in November .
...
He does not want to discuss those conversations publicly because in Washington , you can work behind the scenes and not worry about getting credit and actually get something done -- or you can talk about it in the press and not get anything done .
But ... he wants to see this resolved before the convention and will encourage the superdelegates to make their choice known once the voters in the remaining states have had their say . "
In an interview with AP 's Nedra Pickler , Dean also made it clear he wants to get the show on the road .
" There 'll be some nasty fights if it goes to convention , and people will walk out , " he told Nedra .
" But I 've also been talking to a fairly significant number of , by and large , nonaligned people about how we might resolve this . "
Nedra adds : " Dean would n't talk in detail about what the plan is , but it likely involves encouraging superdelegates to pick a candidate shortly after the voting ends . "
So June 3 - July 1 is your window , ladies and gents .

HARRY SMITH : “ Joining us is Howard Dean , chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
Good morning , Dr. Dean . ”
HOWARD DEAN : “ Harry , thanks for having me on . ”
HARRY SMITH : “ There 's a lot of ill will growing among Democrats .
Polls show a significant number of supporters of both candidates , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , say that they will switch to John McCain if their candidate is not chosen .
How are you going to put this back together again ? ”
DEAN : “ Well , I think the candidates have got to understand that they have an obligation to our country to unify .
Somebody 's going to lose this race with 49.8 percent of the vote .
And that person has got to pull their supporters in behind the nominee .
That 's our obligation , because in the end this is not about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
It 's about our country .
We 're not going to have four more years of George W. Bush , which is essentially what McCain is offering us .
There 's a really big difference between our candidates on these issues .
And I do n't believe for a moment that at the end of the day , the Democrats are going to vote for somebody who 's going to put more right - wingers on the Supreme Court .
But we do need to keep in mind that personal attacks now , often do have the seeds of demoralization later on .
So I want to make sure this campaign stays on the high ground . ”
SMITH : “ OK -- well , you 're coming on morning television this morning to say this .
Have you talked to both candidates or talked at least to their people ? ”
DEAN : “ I have done both .
I 'm not going to say how those conversations went .
I have good relationships with both candidates .

SMIITH : “ Have they pledged to tone down the rhetoric ? ”
DEAN : “ Well , you know , I ’m not going to get into who said what on the telephone calls .
But I think that it 's important that we understand this is not , again , about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
It 's about a change for our country .

SMITH : “ Well , [ the nominating ] season is over .
Do you want the superdelegates to have some sort of vote immediately so that you 'll know months in advance of the convention what the outcome is ? ”
DEAN : “ Well , I think the superdelegates have already been weighing in .
I think that there 's 800 of them and 450 of them have already said who they 're for .
I 'd like the other 350 to say who they 're at some point between now and the first of July so we do n't have to take this into the convention . ”

The food and transport industries say the issue is more complicated .
The debate has put some companies on the defensive , including Tesco , Britain ’s largest supermarket chain , known as a vocal promoter of green initiatives .
Some of those companies say that they are working to limit greenhouse gases produced by their businesses but that the question is how to do it .
They oppose regulation and new taxes and , partly in an effort to head them off , are advocating consumer education instead .

Thomas is n't the only transmale facing difficulties .
In last Sunday 's New York Times Magazine , there was a story about the opposition transmen are facing at women 's colleges .
The piece profiled Rey , a college freshman who started his university career at Barnard , only to transfer to Columbia because of the number of issues he faced .
According to writer Alissa Quart , Rey is not alone in his alienation : " Many trans students feel themselves to be excluded or isolated at women 's schools and at coed colleges .
Some talk of being razzed or insulted by fellow students . "
But Quart also discusses the question of how colleges meant for women are supposed to serve people who no longer identify as women in the first place .
Will society ever be able to accommodate all the facets of the gender spectrum ?
Or will cases like Thomas 's and Rey 's always be a struggle for acceptance and personal freedom ?

“ A Nation at Risk ” Twenty - Five Years Later
In 1983 , A Nation at Risk misidentified what is wrong with our public schools and consequently set the nation on a school reform crusade that has done more harm than good .
The diagnosis of the National Commission on Excellence in Education was flawed in three respects : First , it wrongly concluded that student achievement was declining .
Second , it placed the blame on schools for national economic problems over which schools have relatively little influence .
Third , it ignored the responsibility of the nation ’s other social and economic institutions for learning .
As to student achievement : A Nation at Risk based its analysis of declining student achievement entirely on average SAT scores which had dropped by about half a standard deviation from 1963 to 1980 .
But much of the decline had been due to the changing composition of SAT test takers — in the early 1960s , the preponderance of SAT test takers were high school students planning to apply to the most selective colleges .
By 1983 , the demographic composition of SAT test takers had mostly stabilized , and average SAT scores were again rising , not declining . [ 1 ]
Trend scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) also show a more complex picture than Risk described .
In elementary and middle school math , average scores rose for both black and white students , starting in the late 1970s .
This trend might not yet have been fully understood by Risk commission members — they might have concluded that the upturn then barely detectable would be short - lived .
But the rise has certainly continued subsequent to 1983 .
Indeed as the figure below shows , for black students , the improvement has been so dramatic that black fourth grade math scores today are now higher than white fourth grade scores in 1978 .
In other words , if white math achievement had been stagnant , the black - white achievement gap would have been entirely closed .
The continued gap is due to substantial improvement in white scores as well .
Eighth grade math scores have also increased since 1978 , although not by as much ; for twelfth graders , white scores have been stagnant , while black scores had a big increase from 1982 to 1990 , and have been stagnant since .
Reading scores are less positive .
For whites , reading performance is not substantially better now than in 1978 , at the fourth , eighth , or twelfth grade levels .
But it is not worse either .
For blacks , reading performance is better , but not nearly as much better as in math .
None of this , however , supports the decline thesis of A Nation at Risk .
Because of the report ’s doomsday aura , policymakers have mostly failed since 1983 to investigate the causes of these improvements — the obvious , unasked , question is , what were we doing right from 1978 to 1990 ( and since ) , so we can do more of it ?
A belief in decline has led to irresponsibility in school reform .
Policymakers who believed they could do no harm because American schools were already in a state of collapse have imposed radical reforms without careful consideration of possible unintended adverse consequences .
Not thinking that President Reagan ’s rule ( “ if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it ” ) applied to what conservatives and liberals alike assumed was an already broken school system , this irresponsibility reached its zenith in the bipartisan No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) law of 2002 .
I do not suggest that American schools are adequate , that American students ’ level of achievement in math and reading is where it should be , that American schools have been improving as rapidly as they should , or that the achievement gap is narrowing to the extent needed to give us any satisfaction .
I only suggest that we should approach fixing a system differently if we believe its outcomes are slowly improving than if we believe it is collapsing .
And we owe the latter , flawed assumption , to A Nation at Risk .
Perhaps the greatest damage has been done by narrowing the curriculum in an effort to boost math and reading test scores .
The trend is most notable since the enactment of NCLB , as schools have diminished attention to history , civics , the sciences , art , music , physical education , character development , and social skills , to make more instructional time available for test preparation in math and reading .
This distortion of the historical breadth of American public school goals has been most pronounced for minority and other disadvantaged children .
These are the children who most need a broad curriculum , as well as further gains in math and reading .
[ 2 ]
Risk , to its credit , worried that “ schools may emphasize such rudiments as reading and computation at the expense of other essential skills such as comprehension , analysis , solving problems , and drawing conclusions , ” and it asserted , “ Our concern , however , goes well beyond matters such as industry and commerce .
It also includes the intellectual , moral , and spiritual strengths of our people … . ” [ 3 ]
But these caveats were buried beneath the report ’s urgent calls to improve the reading and ( especially ) math skills that purportedly determined the nation ’s economic health , and to increase the standardized testing that would spur such improvement .
From an irrational faith in the ability of standardized tests to inspire greater learning , and from an unwillingness to finance more expensive tests that would sample critical thinking as well as basic skills , we ’ve again narrowed the curriculum to “ minimum competency , ” precisely the 1970s standard that A Nation at Risk denounced .
From a belief that an alleged decline in student achievement must be attributable to a decline in teacher quality , at best , or to malfeasance ( “ low expectations ” ) of teachers , at worst , many districts have attempted to overcome this teacher incompetence by implementing scripted , or nearly so , curricula .
We ’ve attempted to focus teachers ’ attention by a testing regime so rigid that it threatens to destroy teachers ’ intrinsic motivation and their ability to address the full range of student difficulties that can only be diagnosed by creative teachers , student - by - student .
Again , this does not suggest that teachers are as well - trained as they should be , as well - motivated as we would like them to be , or as student - oriented as they must be .
But it is hard to defend the proposition that teachers , especially those of minority and disadvantaged children , have been sitting around making excuses for poor performance when these children have gained a full standard deviation in test score improvement in a single generation .
As to schools ’ responsibility for economic ills : [ 4 ]
A Nation at Risk claimed that increased market shares for Japanese automobiles , German machine tools , and Korean steel reflected the superior education of those nations ’ workers :
Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce , industry , science , and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world … .
[ T ]he educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation … . [ 5 ]
The report claimed that a “ long - term decline in educational achievement ” was somehow connected to “ a steady 15 - year decline in industrial productivity , as one great American industry after another falls to world competition . ” [ 6 ]
Risk then stimulated a spate of similar reports through the late 1980s and early 1990s , all making similar claims that import penetration could be blamed on poor American education .
For example , in 1990 , a group of prominent Democrats and Republicans calling themselves the National Center on Education and the Economy followed with another report , America ’s Choice : High Skills or Low Wages .
It saw skills development as virtually the only policy lever for shaping the economy .
It charged that inadequate skills attained at flawed schools had caused industrial productivity to “ slow to a crawl ” and would , without radical school reform , lead to permanently low wages for the bottom 70 percent of all Americans .
Leading public intellectuals such as Robert Reich focused attention on human capital solutions in a laissez - faire global system .
His book The Work of Nations argued that international competition would be won by nations with the most ( and best ) “ symbolic analysts , ” not “ routine ” workers .
Lester Thurow ’s Head to Head forecast that Western Europe would come to dominate the United States and Japan economically because European schools were superior .
Mainstream economists , both liberal and conservative , agreed that rising wage and income inequality were caused by an acceleration of “ skill - biased technological change , ” meaning that computerization and other advanced technologies were bidding up the relative value of education , leaving the less - skilled worse off .
Yet the response of American manufacturers to this allegedly education - driven import competition was curious .
Automakers moved plants to Mexico , where worker education levels are considerably lower than those in the American Midwest .
Meanwhile , Japanese manufacturers pressed their advantage by setting up non-union plants in places like Kentucky and Alabama , states not known for having the best - educated workers .
High school graduates in those locations apparently had no difficulty working in teams and adapting to Japanese just - in - time manufacturing methods .
The ink was barely dry on the America ’s Choice report when Americans ’ ability to master technological change generated an extraordinary decade - long acceleration of productivity , beginning in the mid-1990s and exceeding that of other advanced countries .
The productivity leap was accomplished by the very same workforce that the experts claimed imperiled our future .
No presidential commissions announced that American schools must be superior to those of Western Europe and Japan , as evidenced by our more rapid productivity growth .
Again , the authors of A Nation at Risk cannot entirely be faulted for assuming that poor education had caused a productivity collapse .
The big upturn in productivity growth began after Risk was issued .
But it did begin , and productivity advances created new wealth with the potential to support a steady increase in the standards of living of all Americans .
And for a brief period , standards of living did indeed increase , because the fruits of productivity growth were broadly shared .
As the chart shows , the late 1990s saw increasing wages for both high school and college graduates . [ 7 ]
Even wages of high school dropouts climbed .
But no presidential commissions praised American schools for producing widely shared prosperity .
The collapse of the stock bubble in 2000 , the recession of the early 2000s , and the intensification of policies hostile to labor brought wage growth to a halt .
Living standards again began to decline and inequality zoomed — at the same time that workforce productivity continued to climb .
White - collar offshoring to India , China , and other low - wage countries signaled that globalization was now taking its toll on computer programmers and other symbolic analysts of the information age .
Today , however , a new cast of doomsayers has resuscitated an old storyline , picking up where A Nation at Risk left off .
Forgetting how wrong such analyses were in the 1980s and ‘ 90s , the contemporary cliché is that however good schools may once have been , the 21st century makes them obsolete .
Global competition requires all students to graduate from high school prepared either for academic college or for technical training requiring equivalent cognitive ability .
We can only beat the Asians by being smarter and more creative than they are .
The argument got a boost from New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman ’s 2005 book , The World is Flat , and has been repeated by the same National Center on Education and the Economy in Tough Choices , a sequel to its 1990 report .
The argument has also garnered support from influential foundations such as the Gates Foundation , and its chairman , Bill Gates , and from education advocacy groups such as the American College Testing Program .
The Tough Choices report bemoans the fact that “ Indian engineers make $ 7,500 a year against $ 45,000 for an American engineer with the same qualifications ” and concludes from this that we can compete with the Indian economy only if our engineers are smarter than theirs .
This is silly :
No matter how good our schools , American engineers wo n’t be six times as smart as those in the rest of the world .
Nonetheless , Marc Tucker , author of Tough Choices ( and president of the group that produced the 1990 report as well ) , asserts , “ The fact is that education holds the key to personal and national economic well - being , more now than at any time in our history . ”
Administration officials blame workers ’ education for middle - class income stagnation .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson contends that “ market forces work to provide the greatest rewards to those with the needed skills in the growth areas .
This means that those workers with less education and fewer skills will realize fewer rewards and have fewer opportunities to advance . ”
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan frequently blamed schools for inequality : “ We have not been able to keep up the average skill level in our workforce to match the required increases of increasing technology … . ”
But these 21st - century claims are as misguided as those of the last century .
Of course , we should work to improve schools for the middle class .
And we have an urgent need to help more students from disadvantaged families graduate from good high schools .
If those students do so , our society can become more meritocratic , with children from low - income and minority families better able to compete for good jobs with children from more privileged homes .
But the biggest threats to the next generation ’s success come from social and economic policy failures , not schools .
And enhancing opportunity requires much more than school improvement .
If A Nation at Risk commissioners could not have known that explosive economic growth was just around the corner , today ’s education scolds have no such excuse .
Workforce skills continue to generate rising productivity .
In the last five years , wages of both high school - and college - educated workers have been stagnant , while productivity grew by a quite healthy 10.4 percent .
Rising workforce skills can indeed make American firms more competitive .
But better skills , while essential , are not the only source of productivity growth .
The honesty of our capital markets , the accountability of our corporations , our fiscal policy and currency management , our national investment in R&D and infrastructure , and the fair - play of the trading system ( or its absence ) , also influence whether the U.S. economy reaps the gains of Americans ’ diligence and ingenuity .
The singular obsession with schools deflects political attention from policy failures in those other realms .
But while adequate skills are an essential component of productivity growth , workforce skills cannot determine how the wealth created by national productivity is distributed .
That decision is made by policies over which schools have no influence — tax , regulatory , trade , monetary , technology , and labor market policies that modify the market forces affecting how much workers will be paid .
Continually upgrading skills and education is essential for sustaining growth as well as for closing historic race and ethnic gaps .
It does not , however , guarantee economic success without policies that also reconnect pay with productivity growth .
American middle - class living standards are threatened , not because workers lack competitive skills but because the richest among us have seized the fruits of productivity growth , denying what were historically considered fair shares to the working - and middle - class Americans , educated in American schools , who have created this new national wealth .
Over the last few decades , wages of college graduates overall have increased , but some college graduates — managers , executives , white - collar sales workers — have commandeered disproportionate shares , with little left over for scientists , engineers , teachers , computer programmers , and others with high levels of skill .
No amount of school reform can undo policies that redirect wealth generated by skilled workers to profits and executive bonuses .
A Nation at Risk gave renewed currency to the claim , now conventional , that the changing nature of work would require radical changes in education :
Computers and computer - controlled equipment are penetrating every aspect of our lives – homes , factories , and offices … . [ B ] y the turn of the century , millions of jobs will involve laser technology and robotics .
Technology is rapidly transforming a host of other occupations .
They include health care , medical science , energy production , food processing , construction , and the building , repair and maintenance of sophisticated scientific , educational , military , and industrial equipment . [ 8 ]
This description is literally true ; indeed , it explains much of the dramatic rise in productivity we ’ve experienced .
But the conclusion that these changes would require radical changes in education was flawed .
It ignored the obvious reality that technology de-skills many jobs .
Retail clerks now routinely use laser technology to scan bar codes ; these clerks no longer need basic arithmetic skills .
College graduates are , in fact , not in short supply .
Indeed , some college graduates are now forced to take jobs requiring only high - school educations .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that , for the next decade , only 22 percent of job vacancies will require a college degree or more .
Forty percent will require only one month or less of on - the - job training , and could be filled by high school graduates or , in many cases , by dropouts — retail salespersons and waiters and waitresses , for example . [ 9 ]
In many high - school hallways nowadays , you can find a chart displaying the growing “ returns to education ” — the ratio of college to high - school graduates ’ wages . [ 10 ]
The idea is to impress on youths the urgency of going to college and the calamity that will befall those who do n’t .
The data are real — college graduates do earn more than high - school graduates , and the gap is substantially greater than it was a few decades ago .
But it is too facile to conclude that this ratio proves a shortage of college graduates .
The denominator — the falling real wages of high - school graduates — has played a bigger part in boosting the college - to - high - school wage ratio than has the numerator — an unmet demand for college graduates .
Important causes of this decline of high school graduates ’ wages have been the weakening of labor market institutions , such as the minimum wage and unions , which once boosted the pay of high school - educated workers .
For the first time in a decade , the minimum wage was recently increased .
The curious result will be a statistical decline in “ returns to education . ”
But we should not conclude from a minimum - wage increase that we need fewer college graduates , any more than we should have concluded from falling wages for high - school graduates that college graduates are scarce and schools are failing .
Another too glib canard is that our education system used to be acceptable because students could graduate from high school ( or even drop out ) and still support families with good manufacturing jobs .
Today , those jobs are vanishing , and with them the chance of middle - class incomes for those without good educations .
It ’s true that many manufacturing jobs have disappeared .
Replacements have mostly been equally unskilled or semiskilled jobs in service and retail sectors .
There was never anything more inherently valuable about working in a factory assembly line than about changing bed linens in a hotel .
What once made semiskilled manufacturing jobs desirable was that many ( though not most ) were protected by unions , provided pensions and health insurance , and compensated with decent wages .
That today ’s working class does n’t get similar protections has nothing to do with the adequacy of its education , but everything to do with policy decisions stemming from the value we place on equality .
Hotel jobs that pay $ 20 an hour , with health and pension benefits ( rather than $ 10 an hour without benefits ) typically do so because of union organization , not because maids earned bachelor ’s degrees .
It is cynical to tell millions of Americans who work ( and who will continue to be needed to work ) in low - level administrative jobs and in janitorial , food - service , hospitality , transportation , and retail industries that their wages have stagnated because their educations are inadequate for international competition .
The quality of our civic , cultural , community , and family lives demands school improvement , but barriers to unionization are a more important cause of low wages than the quality of workers ’ education .
Fortunately , the elite consensus on education as a cure - all seems now to be collapsing .
Offshoring of high - tech jobs has deeply undercut the Clinton - era metaphor of an education - fueled transition to the information age , since it is all too apparent that college educations and computer skills do not insulate Americans from globalization ’s downsides .
Former Clinton economic advisor ( and Federal Reserve vice chairman ) Alan Blinder has emerged as an establishment voice calling attention to the potentially large - scale impact of continued offshoring .
Blinder stresses that the distinction between American jobs likely to be destroyed by international competition and those likely to survive , is not one of workers ’ skills or education .
“ It is unlikely that the services of either taxi drivers or airline pilots will ever be delivered electronically over long distances … .
Janitors and crane operators are probably immune to foreign competition ; accountants and computer programmers are not . ” [ 11 ]
These are not problems that can be solved by vouchers , charter schools , teacher accountability , or any other school intervention .
A balanced human capital policy would involve schools , but would require tax , regulatory , and labor market reforms as well .
As to the relative responsibility of schools : A Nation at Risk was issued in 1983 , a decade after the nation ’s postwar narrowing of social and economic inequality had ended .
By the time of the report , income was becoming less evenly distributed .
The real value of the minimum wage was falling and the share of the workforce with union protection was declining .
Progress towards integration had halted and , as William Julius Wilson noted in The Truly Disadvantaged , published only half a dozen years later , the poorest black children were becoming isolated in dysfunctional inner-city communities to an extent not previously seen in American social history .
Social and economic disadvantage contributes in important ways to poor student achievement .
Children in poor health attend quality schools less regularly .
Those with inadequate housing change schools frequently , disrupting not only their own educations but those of their classmates .
Children whose parents are less literate and whose homes have less rich intellectual environments enter school already so far behind that they rarely can catch up .
Parents under severe economic stress cannot provide the support children need to excel .
And , as Wilson described , children in neighborhoods without academically successful role models are less likely to develop academic ambitions themselves . [ 12 ]
These nonschool influences on academic achievement were known to the commissioners who authored A Nation at Risk .
The Coleman Report of 1966 , still a major document of recent research history , had concluded that family background factors were more important influences on student achievement variation than school quality . [ 13 ]
In 1972 and 1979 , Christopher Jencks and his colleagues had published two widely noticed reassessments of Coleman , Inequality and Who Gets Ahead ? , both of which confirmed the Coleman Report ’s central finding .
Yet the National Commission on Excellence in Education , in preparation for its Nation at Risk report , commissioned 40 research studies from the leading academic researchers in the nation , and not one of these was primarily devoted to the social and economic factors that affect learning .
Most remarkably , A Nation at Risk concluded with a brief “ Word to Parents and Students , ” acknowledging that schools alone could not reverse the alleged decline in academic performance .
It urged parents to be a “ living example of what you expect your children to honor and emulate …
You should encourage more diligent study and discourage satisfaction with mediocrity … . ” [ 14 ]
This was the report ’s only reference to nonschool factors that influence learning .
A Nation at Risk therefore changed the national conversation about education from the Coleman - Jencks focus on social and economic influences to an assumption that schools alone could raise and equalize student achievement .
The distorted focus culminated in the No Child Left Behind legislation of 2002 , demanding that school accountability alone for raising test scores should raise achievement to never - before - attained levels , and equalize outcomes by race and social class as well .
A Nation at Risk was well - intentioned , but based on flawed analyses , at least some of which should have been known to the commission that authored it .
The report burned into Americans ’ consciousness a conviction that , evidence notwithstanding , our schools are failures , and warped our view of the relationship between schools and economic well - being .
It distracted education policymakers from insisting that our political , economic , and social institutions also have a responsibility to prepare children to be ready to learn when they attend school .
There are many reasons to improve American schools , but declining achievement and international competition are not good arguments for doing so .
Asking schools to improve dramatically without support from other social and economic institutions is bound to fail , as a quarter century of experience since A Nation at Risk has demonstrated .

Battling for support in Pennsylvania and other blue - collar bastions , Barack Obama fended off charges of elitism and insensitivity Friday after painting a harsh portrait of America ’s struggling small towns .
The controversy -- fanned by rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain -- began when the Huffington Post website published remarks the Illinois senator made last weekend at a closed - door San Francisco fundraiser .
In those comments , Obama said he understood why residents of some hard - pressed communities grew angry .
“ You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and , like a lot of small towns in the Midwest , the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing ’s replaced them , ” Obama said .
“ And it ’s not surprising , then , they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . ”

Fellow Democrat Clinton , campaigning in Pennsylvania ahead of the state ’s April 22 primary , suggested Obama was offering condescension rather than solutions .
“ Pennsylvania does n’t need a president who looks down on them , ” the New York senator said at a Philadelphia rally .
“ They need a president who stands up for them , who fights for them . ”
A strategist for Sen. McCain ( R - Ariz . ) joined in the criticism .
“ It ’s a remarkable statement and extremely revealing , ” said Steve Schmidt .
“ It shows an elitism and a condescension toward hardworking Americans that is nothing short of breathtaking . ”
Obama fired back at a stop in Terre Haute , Ind. , saying he had merely explained why some appear to vote against their economic interests .
“ They do n’t expect anyone ’s going to help them , ” Obama said , suggesting Clinton and McCain were the ones who were out of touch .

He said voters “ want to see a change in Washington , and that ’s why I ’m running for president . ”
The Illinois senator has struggled to build support among working - class voters , who make up a big chunk of Pennsylvania ’s electorate .
Clinton hopes to win there -- as she did in Ohio -- to prove she would be the stronger general - election candidate in big states Democrats need to win .

A Cuneiform clay tablet that has puzzled researchers for over 150 years is now believed to describe an asteroid impact in 3123 BC in Austria .
Researchers believe the tablet , which seemingly describes a cataclysmic event , may account for the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah .
No mention of pillars of salt however , on the clay tablet .
Geologists discovered evidence of a giant landslide centered at KÃ¶fels , Austria back in the 19th century .
At 500 meters thick and five kilometers in diameter , this landslide mystified researchers trying to figure out why such an event occurred .
Some researchers thought the landslide may have been caused by a meteorite impact , because of the evidence of crushing pressures and explosions .
But there was no crater , so it didnâ€™t look as an impact site should , and the impact theory fell out of favor .
But researchers knew this wasnâ€™t just an ordinary landslide .
But new research brings the impact theory back into play .
It centers on another 19th century mystery , a Cuneiform tablet in the British Museum , known as â€ œthe Planisphereâ€ .
It was found in the remains of the library in the Royal Place at Nineveh , and was made by an Assyrian scribe around 700 BC .
It is an astronomical work with drawings of constellations and the text has known constellation names .
The clay tablet has attracted a lot of attention but until now no one has come up with a convincing explanation as to what it is .
Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell from Bristol University used computer programs to simulate trajectories and reconstruct the night sky thousands of years ago to establish what the Planisphere tablet refers to .
It is a copy of the night notebook of a Sumerian astronomer as he records the events in the sky before dawn on the 29 June 3123 BC ( Julian calendar ) .
Half the tablet records planet positions and cloud cover , but the other half of the tablet records an object large enough for its shape to be noted even though it is still in space .
The astronomer made an accurate note of its trajectory relative to the stars , which to an error better than one degree is consistent with an impact at KÃ¶fels .
The observation suggests the asteroid is over a kilometer in diameter and the original orbit about the Sun was an Aten type , a class of asteroid that orbits close to the earth , that is resonant with the Earthâ€™s orbit .
This trajectory explains why there is no crater at KÃ¶fels .
The incoming angle was very low ( six degrees ) and means the asteroid clipped a mountain near the town of LÃ¤ngenfeld , 11 kilometers from KÃ¶fels , and this caused the asteroid to explode before it reached its final impact point .
As it travelled down the valley it became a fireball , about five kilometers in diameter ( the size of the landslide ) .
When it hit KÃ¶fels it created enormous pressures that pulverized the rock and caused the landslide but because it was no longer a solid object it did not create a classic impact crater .
Mark Hempsell , hinting at the possible fate of Sodom and Gomorrah , added , â€ œAnother conclusion can be made from the trajectory .
The back plume from the explosion ( the mushroom cloud ) would be bent over the Mediterranean Sea re-entering the atmosphere over the Levant , Sinai , and Northern Egypt .
The ground heating though very short would be enough to ignite any flammable material – including human hair and clothes .
It is probable more people died under the plume than in the Alps due to the impact blast.â€ 
This evidence seems to coincide with the biblical story of the legendary dens of vice ( â€ œ Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah – from the Lord out of the heavensâ€ – Genesis 19:24 ) but it ’s never been categorically proven that the towns actually existed in their suspected location close to the Dead Sea .
And the story of Lot ’s wife turning into a pillar of salt for turning around to witness the mayhem is just biblical legend as well .
The full translation of the tablet together with the analysis supporting these conclusions can be found in the book , â€ œA Sumerian Observation of the Kofelsâ€™ Impact Eventâ€ by Bond and Hempsell .

As The Big Apple adopts a new " green " logo , Apple ( purveyor of iThings ) is turning red .
Wired reports that the emblem for New York City 's GreeNYC campaign " shows a stylized apple with a stalk and a leaf .
It bears a resemblance to Apple 's famous logo -- a resemblance Apple says infringes on its trademark . "
While Mother Nature was unavailable for comment , rumor is the Partridge Family bird has been chirping about a trademark infringement case himself .
In the meantime , NYC & Company officially applied to trademark their apple logo early last year , as Apple filed a formal opposition .
In turn , NYC & Company have filed a counterclaim asking that the infringement complaint be dismissed .
This could go on forever ... but experts say it will likely be resolved in 9 months .
The next step is to survey people 's reaction to the new logo , to see whether Apple 's complaint can hold up .
Apple ( who have planted their seed all over town ) is saying that the logo used by the city will " seriously injure the reputation which [ Apple ] has established for its goods and services . "
Cocotron is a developer SDK which implements a usable amount AppKit and Foundation for Windows and Foundation for Linux / BSD in Objective - C.
You need to install cross-compilers and cross -compile the frameworks using Xcode on Mac OS X .
The Cocotron is an open source project which aims to implement a cross-platform Objective - C API similar to that described by Apple Inc. 's Cocoa documentation .
This includes the AppKit , Foundation , Objective - C runtime and support APIs such as CoreGraphics and CoreFoundation .
The purpose of the project is to provide an easy to use cross-platform solution for Objective - C development .
In particular , source code level compatibility with recent versions of Apple 's frameworks .
The general goal is to provide complete support on any viable platform , the project is intended to be as portable as possible .
However , most of the work at this time is focused on providing support for Microsoft Windows .
In particular the NT based versions , 2000 up to 10 .
The Cocotron proper is only source code to a runtime , without a compiler and sufficient tools this is relatively useless , so the project also maintains The Cocotron Developer Tools ( CDT ) .
The CDT is a collection of well known and popular open source tools , specifically gcc , binutils and MinGW , which are organized and patched to support the Cocotron project .
The CDT is intended to be used from within Apple Inc.'s Xcode as a cross-compiler , and Cocotron itself is an Xcode project .
Since the majority of Objective - C developers are on Mac OS X using Xcode this allows one to develop and maintain a cross- platform project within one IDE .
The Corner Shot® system is designed in a way that enables security forces to engage targets from the left , and right , from the front , up or down , and to move to each of these shooting positions very rapidly without the removal of hands from the weapon .
This shortens reaction time and increases accuracy in sudden engagement situations .
The weapon system can be triggered completely from behind cover .
Central Banking - Why Fix What Does Not Work ?
Time of the Vulture - In times of expansion , it is to the hare the prizes go .
Quick , risk taking , and bold , his qualities are exactly suited to the times .
In periods of contraction , the tortoise is favored .
Slow and conservative , quick only to retract his vulnerable head and neck , his is the wisest bet when the slow and sure is preferable to the quick and easy .
Every so often , however , there comes a time when neither the hare nor the tortoise is the victor .
This is when both the bear and the bull have been vanquished , when the pastures upon which the bull once grazed are long gone and the bear 's lair itself lies buried deep beneath the rubble of economic collapse .
This is the time of the vulture , for the vulture feeds neither upon the pastures of the bull nor the stored up wealth of the bear .
The vulture feeds instead upon the blind ignorance and denial of the ostrich .
The time of the vulture is at hand .

Economics is not rocket science .
Today 's use of mathematical formulae to explain economics performs the same function as did the use of Latin during the Dark Ages for the Catholic Church .
You do n't need mathematics to explain economics - Professor Antal E. Fekete
Expert on gold & the markets - Professor of Mathematics 1958 - 1993
To understand modern economics , however , it is necessary to understand credit .
Prior to credit - based paper money , credit did not play the same role as today .
Now , however , credit and its cancerous twin , debt , are the very foundation of all modern economies .
The relationship between credit and modern economies is similar to that between steroids and athletic performance .
Before credit based money , markets were free and economies functioned according to existing supply and existing demand ; but with the introduction of credit based money and central banks , that relationship changed dramatically .
Economies now respond primarily to the supply and cost of credit , not to the natural demand of free markets ; and , today , the ability to absorb credit 's consequent and compounding debt is the single most important factor of market health in credit based modern economies .
While credit enhances economic expansion much as steroids enhance athletic performance , just like steroids , the enhancement is artificial and unless continued , is temporary .
But , if continued , credit enhanced expansion will damage the economy just as continued steroid usage damages the physical body .
The experiment with credit based money and central banking began with the Bank of England in 1694 .
In my article Christmas On Threadneedle Street & The Coming Depression , http://www.drschoon.com/articles.., I traced the history of credit based money and central banking from Victorian England to the present .
No experiment , no matter how long in existence , lasts forever .
The world 's experiment with credit - based “ money ” and central banking — and their bastard offspring , capital markets , is almost over ; and , for those not in denial , the handwriting is clearly on the wall .
CHOKING ON CREDIT DROWNING IN DEBT
Capital is credit , not money , and although modern economists blur the distinction , that does not make it so .
In the belief , however , lies the consequence .
We have acted as if credit is money and have , as a consequence , become collectively indebted into perpetuity .
Why this has happened is obvious .
Who profits from debt ?
Bankers
Who runs our economies ?
Bankers
Prior to the 1700s , bankers played but a minor role in economies .
Then called money - lenders — those whose livelihood was the charging interest on the lending of gold — their profession was held in low esteem , unlike today .
At the time , the Catholic Church considered the charging of interest on the loaning of money to be a sin .
THE ALCHEMY OF CENTRAL BANKING
THE SUBSTITUTION OF PAPER COUPONS FOR GOLD
Today , bankers profit not by charging interest on the loaning of gold , but by charging interest on the loaning of paper money from central banks .
The creation of central banks allowed bankers to substitute paper coupons , sic paper money , printed by central banks for the gold they had previously loaned .
Not bad — if you 're a banker .
This is the true miracle of modern banking — the substitution of paper coupons for gold and the ability to loan the coupons and still charge interest .
In truth , it is not a miracle at all .
It is a monetary abomination for which we are about to pay .
The “ miracle ” or trick of substituting paper coupons for gold could not have been accomplished without the active aid and complicity of governments .
The link joining private bankers and public government is central banks , a private institution that allegedly acts on behalf of the public interest — and if you believe that , well , unfortunately you 're among the majority that erroneously do .
It is through the device of central banking that governments have been able to indebt their citizenry into infinite debt .
By allowing central banks to debase currencies and issue debt as money , governments have been able to indebt future generations and spend their revenues today , revenues that do n't really exist except through the “ miracle ” of central banking .
Central banks gave government what governments truly desired — the ability to spend more than what they have .
They could n't do it with gold but they could do it with central bank coupons masquerading as money ; and , in return for this extraordinary gift , governments turned over to private bankers one of the most important powers of government , the power to coin money .
With the power to coin money , bankers immediately substituted credit based paper coupons for the gold and silver which previously circulated as money .
By this substitution , governments delivered their citizenry into bondage to the bankers forever .
Today , the amount of our collective and individual debt and its compounding interest is incapable of ever being repaid .
For this sorry state of affairs , we can thank our elected representatives and our respective governments .
The blame , however , must be reserved for ourselves .
The US is a democracy and the power to prevent this was granted to us in the US Constitution .
Unfortunately , that power was never exercised — and now it is too late .
THE GAME IS OVER
.. the ability to absorb credit 's consequent and compounding debt is the single most important factor of market health in credit based modern economies .
Debt markets are now collapsing much to the surprise of bankers and their government overseers , i.e. co-conspirators .
The whole gambit of bankers — central , commercial , and investment — and their cohorts in government were caught off - guard by the sudden contraction of debt markets in August 2007 , a contraction that is continuing today in spite of central banks and governments “ best efforts ” to supply more credit in the hopes of saving the markets responsible for filling their troughs .
MORE CREDIT WON'T WORK WHEN THE PROBLEM IS DEBT
From Doug Noland 's April 4 , 2008 Credit Bubble Bulletin :
March 28 - Financial Times ( Paul J Davies ) : “ Global debt issuance collapsed in the first quarter as the credit crunch took its toll on new deals in all sectors …
Total debt market volumes were $ 1,030bn in the first quarter , a 48 % drop compared with the same quarter a year ago , while total syndicated loan market volumes were $ 599bn , a 47 % drop versus the same period last year , according to Dealogic …
The numbers illustrate how the withdrawal of liquidity from the world 's debt markets in the wake of the turmoil that began in the US mortgage markets has affected everything from the safest corporate borrower to the most risky private equity backed leveraged buy - out deal .
Structured finance markets , which cover mortgage - backed bonds and complex products such as collateralized debt obligations , unsurprisingly suffered the worst contractions .
Globally , new deal volumes of just $ 81.5 bn were 89 % less than the first quarter of 2007 .
This volume was the lowest since the first quarter of 1996 .
March 31 – Reuters ( Nancy Leinfuss ) : “ U.S. issuance of asset - backed securities tumbled 83 % in this year 's first quarter as investors fled the risky subprime mortgage segment that fueled a global credit crisis in 2007 .
ABS issuance slumped to $ 54.7 billion in this year 's first quarter compared with the $ 323.3 billion sold in the year - ago quarter , Thomson Financial said …
Doug Noland 's article confirms in detail the continuing collapse and marked slowing of debt markets , a slowing that will lead to another Great Depression and the end of capital markets if it continues and it will .
The end game is now in motion — albeit a very deadly slow motion .
If capital expansion slows , like bicycles , capitalism does n't do as well at slow speeds .
Capital markets did not exist before credit based money was invented and central banking “ appeared ” in 1694 .
They will not exist in the future — at least not in their present form .
THE LAST HAPPY CHRISTMAS
The collapse of the markets in summer 2007 was the first sign that credit based modern economies were unraveling .
At the time , Martha and I were in Szombathely , Hungary , attending Session II of Gold Standard University Live ; and , although far from the markets , the internet brought us daily updates of problems in London , New York , Shanghai , Tokyo etc .
On our return to the US , we stopped in London and booked a hotel in The City , the name given to London 's financial district .
The City was unusually quiet on Monday August 27 th as it was an official Bank Holiday , nonetheless , the silence and lack of activity on a weekday in London was eerie , perhaps signaling a portent of what was to come .
But another disturbing portent was the US Christmas season .
Usually , stores and malls are filled with increasingly frantic shoppers hoping to complete their quotas of presents before Christmas Eve .
This year , however , the Christmas shopping season was very different .
The malls were half empty and the crowds were far less from what we had come to expect .
It was then that it occurred to me — that in the future , Christmas 2007 was going to be remembered in America as the last happy Christmas .
Martha and I returned to London in December to celebrate our own Christmas .
This time we stayed on Threadneedle Street almost directly across from the Bank of England .
We wanted to see the Central Bank up close , where coupon money had been first printed and then passed on to an unwitting public ; and , we had more than the usual interest in the Bank of England 's museum which gives the Bank 's sanitized version of the evolution , sic debasement , of money .
Of course , being the Christmas holidays , the financial district surrounding the Bank of England was quiet .
But irrespective of the holidays , since our visit in August , financial activity in The City has lessened considerably .
Instead of record highs in the financial markets and commensurate bonuses , the closing down of hedge funds and the laying off of workers in the financial sector is now the normal news .
It will not , however , be the same next Christmas .
It will be worse .
Darryl Robert Schoon at The Bank of England on Threadneedle Street , Christmas Day 2007
THE ONLY ROAD OUT
If you have faith and investments in gold and silver , you 're going to need them both in the days ahead ; and , of the two , faith will be the more valuable .
The bill for our experiment with central banking and credit based money is now due and owing and is about to be paid by all of us .
The settling of debts will not be pleasant .
The birth of credit based money and modern economies began in England at the Bank of England in 1694 .
It will not , however , end there .
It will end wherever credit 's long grasp has reached .
It will end in your country , in your town and in your city .
It will end in your bank and in your bank account .
It 's going to be ugly .
The Time of the Vulture is at hand .
Note : I will be speaking at Professor Antal E. Fekete 's Session IV of Gold Standard University Live ( GSUL ) July 3 - 6 , 2008 in Szombathely , Hungary .
If you are interested in monetary matters and gold , the opportunity to hear Professor Fekete should not be missed .
A perusal of Professor Fekete 's topics may induce you to attend ( see http://www.professorfekete.com/gsul.asp ) .
Professor Fekete , in my opinion , is a giant in a time of small men .

About Darryl Robert Schoon
In college , I majored in political science with a focus on East Asia ( B.A. University of California at Davis , 1966 ) .
My in - depth study of economics did not occur until much later .
In the 1990s , I became curious about the Great Depression and in the course of my study , I realized that most of my preconceptions about money and the economy were just that - preconceptions .
I , like most others , did not really understand the nature of money and the economy .
Now , I have some insights and answers about these critical matters .
In October 2005 , Marshall Thurber , a close friend from law school convened The Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN ) , a group of individuals whom Marshall believed to be " out - of - the - box " thinkers and I was asked to join .
The PDN became a major catalyst in my writings on economic issues .
When I discovered others in the PDN shared my concerns about the US economy , I began writing down my thoughts .
In March 2007 I presented my findings to the Positive Deviant Network in the form of an in - depth 148 - page analysis , " How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper In The Process . "
The reception to my presentation , though controversial , generated a significant amount of interest ; and in May 2007 , " How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process " was made available at www.survivethecrisis.com and I began writing articles on economic issues .
The interest in the book and my writings has been gratifying .
During its first two months , www.survivethecrisis.com was accessed by over 10,000 viewers from 93 countries .
Clearly , we had struck a chord and www.drschoon.com , has been created to address this interest .

ONE hot night last summer , just past midnight , I discovered that in the apartment building across the street from my duplex in Fort Greene there was a little crack house .
I was parking my car after a late movie , the windows down because my air - conditioning was broken , when I heard a man and a woman arguing on the sidewalk .
I did n’t know them , but they were n’t new faces to me .
In the four years I ’d lived in the apartment on South Oxford Street , I ’d walked past them many times .
They were constantly moping around the block with glassy eyes , scratching themselves , and muttering .
Any New Yorker could tell they were crackheads .
I never gave much thought as to why these two crackheads were on my block so often .
Some days in Fort Greene you walk past celebrities like Adrian Grenier or Colson Whitehead or Mos Def .
Some days you walk past a crackhead .
But the intensity of their arguing piqued my interest , so I sat in the car to see how it played out .
After a moment the woman threw a few crumpled - up bills at the man .
They bounced off his chest and fell to the pavement .
He scooped them up , walked to the window of a nearby apartment and passed the bills into a window .
浜 口さんの言葉には、ブクマや突っ込みを生み出す何かがありますね。

そんな浜口さんに贈ります。今よりコストダウンさせて、SI業界を良くする方法。
例えば、誰が書いても同じコードにするために、プログラム設計書(内部設計書)を今、書かせているとしたら、そんな無駄なものはやめたほうがいいと思う。
プログラム設計書は、自然言語で書きます。プログラムは、プログラミング言語で書きます。どっちの言語が、プログラムを書くのに適しているかといえば、誰が考えても、プログラミング言語ですよね。
いきなりプログラミングはできない人もいるから、プログラム設計書が必要だという人もいるかもしれませんが、それは、間違っていると断言しましょう。
いきなりプログラミングできない人に、設計書を書かせても、なんか日本語を書いただけで、それを見てプログラミングをすることはできません。プログラミングできないってことは、論理的に仕様を理解していないってことだから。さらに悪いことに、中身はでたらめでも一応仕様が書かれているものだから、それにあわせて作ろうとする。これで、スパゲティプログラムの出来上がりですよ。
これが、大規模案件に大量のバグをもたらし、想像以上にコストアップさせ、バグを収束させるために、デスマを生むわけです。
プログラムをいきなりかけないという人は、プロジェクトにいきなり入れるのではなく、ちゃんと教育して、プログラムを書けるようになってから、プロジェクトにいれるようにするべきです。
そうすると開発者数がそろえられないという人もいるかもしれませんが、スキルのない人が作ったぐだぐだなコードが原因で炎上して、その火を消すために、スキルのある人が投入されているケースも多いんじゃないかな。単に頭数をそろえても、開発力がアップするわけではありません。逆に、スキルのない人が多ければ、多いほど、火消しに多くの人が割かれ、実質的な頭数は減少します。だったら、最初から、スキルのある人だけ集めたほうが、実際にこなせる仕事量は増えるんじゃないでしょうか。
スキルがあるっていっても、プログラム設計書なしでプログラムが組めるってくらいのスキルですよ。そんなに難しいものじゃない。また、これくらいのスキルもなしに、外に出て働いても、本人のためにならないと思います。デスマにあって心が傷つくだけだから。
今の誰でもいいからって人を集めるやり方だと、教育せずにいきなり現場に放り込むという不幸な現実を生みやすい。企業は人がいればとりあえず金になるから、教育にわざわざ金をかけない。ブラック企業の誕生ですね。そして、新人はデスマに傷つきすぐにやめていってしまう。
仕事を頼む側が、 「 プログラム設計書なしでプログラムが組めるってくらいのスキル」を要求するようにすれば、新人もちゃんと教育してもらえる。企業にとっては、新人教育のコストがかかるようになりますが、すぐにやめることがなくなれば、その分の元は取れるでしょう。もちろん、仕事を頼む側もプログラム設計書を書くコストを削減できるし、だめプログラマが書いたぐだぐだなコードのために炎上することもなくなります。
この業界にとっていいことだらけだよね。
うちの会社ももちろん取り組むけど、データに実践してもらえると、かなり日本のSI業界が変わると思います。
Chartered by Congress in 1919 , the American Legion ( AL ) is America ’s largest wartime veterans service organization .
AL advocates for patriotism and honor , promotes the need for strong national security , and is committed to mentoring youth and sponsors programs in local communities .
The Legion has evolved from a group of WWI veterans into one of the country ’s most influential nonprofit groups .
Current membership stands at almost 2 million , with more than 13,000 posts across the world .
American Legion posts are organized into 55 departments .
There is one post for each state and the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico , France , Mexico , and the Philippines .
In 1921 , WWI veterans ’ efforts helped create the US Veterans Bureau , which was the predecessor of the current Veteran ’s Administration .
Today , AL continues its origin mission by lobbying for adequate funding to cover medical , disability , and education benefits for veterans .
How Does the American Legion Support Our Military Community ?
The American Legion is committed to helping veterans , and their families understand and apply for VA benefits .
In addition to providing this service , the American Legion is committed to improving the quality of life of the communities where veterans reside .
Unlike other veteran organizations like WWP , DAV , or even AMVETS , American Legion offers several types of youth programs , ranging from baseball to debate clubs .
Community programs sponsored and curated by the American Legion focus on how the lives of veterans and their families can be directly improved .
This includes providing resources including family support , amateur radio , and others .
On a national level , American Legion is committed to advocating for veteran rights .
This also includes a decided interest in flag preservation , voting programs , and citizenship lobbying efforts .
Does the American Legion Help with Veterans Benefits Claims ?
American Legion provides the services that guide them to the benefit assistance they need .
Service Officers
Service Officers help connect veterans with appropriate resources to help them file claims .
Benefit Calculators
American Legion ’s benefits calculator is available to help individual veterans understand the benefits that might be available to them .
State benefits calculator which lists veteran benefits by state .
Centers
Veterans Career Center helps veterans connect with employers who understand the skills veterans can bring to their new civilian roles
Education Center is a college search engine powered by CollegeRecon for veterans interested in exploring higher education
Veteran Health Center explores the services available to veterans and advocates for timely , high - quality care
Family and Support Center of the American Legion knows that servicemembers do n’t do it alone and provides the following family support services :
Operation Comfort Warriors provides comfort items , and recreational experiences for recovering servicemembers
Family Support Network has on - hand resources for families who require financial assistance
For female veterans , the American Legion offers resources relating to military sexual trauma ( MST ) and gender - specific healthcare information .
Discounts
Discounts for active duty and retired servicemembers and their families help veterans and servicemembers get the best prices possible for items they routinely use .
These military discounts include everything from vehicle rentals to moving and relocation fees to retail discounts and travel options .
Who Is Eligible for American Legion Membership & Services ?
Honorably discharged veterans who have served in the military in some capacity since December 7 , 1941 , or active duty servicemembers are eligible to join .
Servicemembers from the National Guard and / or Reserves whose units were activated until Title 10 Orders are eligible to participate .
Each local post determines the cost of its dues .
New members who join through the National Headquarters are offered discounted intro rates and are automatically placed in the State Headquarters
Post in the state in which they reside .
The national average for dues is around $ 40 annually .
Find out more here .
How Does the American Legion Compare to Similar Organizations ?
The American Legion is as much about helping veterans as it is about working hard to create communities .
In addition to the offer of benefit assistance , the American Legion exists because of grassroots efforts to keep improving the lives of veterans and their families .
While other organizations like DAV and AMVETS are directly focused on veteran assistance claims , the American Legion extrapolates on that mission and tries its best to reach veterans both when they ’re in need and when they ’re not .
Reports say the ship is carrying millions of rounds of ammunition Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa has urged other African leaders not to allow a ship carrying arms for Zimbabwe to enter their territorial waters .
Mr Mwanawasa said the tension in Zimbabwe , following last month 's disputed elections , should not be allowed to escalate further .
Zimbabwe 's justice minister said it was their right to defend themselves and buy weapons from any legitimate source .
The ship has already been turned away from South Africa and Mozambique .
The Chinese vessel was said to be bound for Angola but the US is reported to be pressuring port authorities there and in Namibia not to allow them to dock .
Even people who have died of natural causes are adopted by the MDC - T
Patrick Chinamasa
Zimbabwe justice minister " I hope this will be the case with all the countries because we do n't want a situation which will escalate the [ tension ] in Zimbabwe more than what it is , " said Mr Mwanawasa .
The International Transport Workers Federation says it has asked its members across Africa not to help unload the An Yue Jiang , which is reportedly carrying three million rounds of ammunition , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and 2,500 mortar rounds .
The opposition says the weapons could be used to " wage war " on its supporters ahead of a possible run-off in the presidential vote .
This is strongly denied by the government , which has accused the opposition of exaggerating claims of recent political violence .
Monitored
The ship , which had been anchored off the port of Durban for four days , was forced to move on Friday after a South African court refused to allow the weapons on board to be transported across the country to landlocked Zimbabwe .
Despite reports the ship was heading for Angola , an ally of Zimbabwe 's government , director of the Institute of Angolan Ports Filomeno Mendonca said the vessel had not asked for permission to dock in Angola .
" This ship has not sought request to enter Angolan territorial waters and it's not authorised to enter Angolan ports , " he told local radio .
A South African military spokesman has said the ship was no longer in South African waters .
South African Defence Ministry spokesperson Themba Gadebe was speaking in response to a claim that the ship remained in the country 's jurisdiction despite last week 's court order .
The Southern Africa Litigation Centre ( Salc ) , which took the matter to court , had asked the South African navy to intervene .
Mr Gadebe said the ship was being monitored but declined to say where it was , except that it was off South Africa 's west coast .
Zimbabwe 's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said it was their right to defend themselves and buy weapons from any legitimate source .
" I do n't understand all this hullabaloo about a lone ship , " he told reporters .
The country has yet to publish the results of its presidential election , which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says was won outright by its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai .

Meanwhile , the southern African regional body , SADC , has rejected Mr Tsvangirai 's calls for South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki to be replaced as the chief mediator for Zimbabwe .
" We have complete faith in President Mbeki , " the AFP news agency quotes Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam as saying .
Mr Tsvangirai has wanted President Mwanawasa to take over , with some opposition supporters saying Mr Mbeki was close to Mr Mugabe .
A recount in 23 out of 210 parliamentary seats , which had been due to end on Monday , was delayed for an unknown period .
The MDC has rejected the recount as illegal and insists it beat President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party outright in the 29 March presidential and parliamentary polls .

Human rights groups say they have found camps where people are being tortured for having voted " the wrong way " .
But Mr Chinamasa denied that anyone had died in political violence .
" Even people who have died of natural causes are adopted by the MDC ( Tsvangirai ) and the cause of death is subsequently attributed to state - sponsored violence , " he said .
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said that of the 10 people reported dead , only four names had been supplied and " of these three no basis whatsoever while the fourth is still under investigation and will be concluded soon " , he was reported as saying by the state - owned Herald newspaper .

8 Greatest Distance Thrown in a Car Accident Continue Reading Below Advertisement
As Newton once postulated , a body will remain at rest , or continue to move at a constant velocity , unless an external net force acts upon it .
That law should now be renamed Matthew McKnight 's law , as no one has demonstrated it as spectacularly as he did the day he was standing around and a car hit him going 70 mph , flinging McKnight a distance equal to more than a third of a football field .
McKnight was struck when he pulled over to help accident victims on Interstate 376 on October 26 , 2001 .
His kindness was repaid with an involuntary flight of 118 feet as well as a broken shoulder , pelvis , leg and tailbone .
Luckily he was quickly surrounded by a crack medical staff who , seeing how far the man had been flung , knew that Guiness must be contacted STAT .

From then on , no matter what else McKnight may have accomplished in his life , he would forever hold the record for Greatest Distance Thrown
In a Car Accident .
Congrats , Matthew !
It was actually McKnight 's emergency room physician , Dr. Eric Brader , that submitted paperwork for the record , because nothing in the Hippocratic Oath specifically bars you from " just being kind of a dick " .
Sex Hormones and City Life
Is it safe to douse cities with synthetic pheromones ?
Prof. Joe Cummins and Sam Burcher

Download the full video from the online store .
Northern California is in the grip of a horrific aerial spray programme designed to eradicate an insect pest , Epiphyas postvittana , the light brown apple moth ( LBAM ) .
The LBAM is native to Australia and is also found in New Zealand , Hawaii , and the United Kingdom where it is not considered a significant pest [ 1 ] .
However , the California Department of Food and Agriculture ( CDFA ) and the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) have prescribed a $ 74.5 million pesticide plan using a synthetic insect sex hormone to eradicate the perceived threat to a number of plant species thought to be susceptible to attack by the LBAM .
These species may include the Californian cypress , oak and redwood trees , as well as ornamental and nursery plants ; and a broad range of citrus , grapes , and deciduous fruit tree crops [ 2 ] .
Botanist Daniel Harder , the executive Director of the Arboretum at UC Santa Cruz , visited New Zealand in 2007 to study the behaviour of the LBAM where its presence does not cause economically significant crop damage , or had a detrimental effect on native flora [ 3 ] .
His research has led him to conclude that , “ It is not such a nasty pest .
You ’re not going to see a plant succumbing to the LBAM . ” [ 1 ] .
Furthermore , he says that there is no reason to believe that this moth will be any more of a problem in California than any other moth from the Torticidae family .
He is confident that earwigs , birds and spiders will eat the moth and its larvae and prevent the devastation envisaged by agricultural officials , and rejects the expensive , unnecessary spraying of a dozen urban communities in the coast and bay areas .
Jim Carey , a UC Davis entomology professor , says that the pesticide plan wo n’t work because the LBAM has been in California for at least thirty , if not fifty years , or more , and that the money would be better spent trying to contain the spread of the LBAM rather than eradicate it altogether .
UC Berkeley associate Professor of Agro-ecology Miguel Altieri agrees , and says that the fact that the moth is here does n’t mean devastation .
Aerial pesticides sprayed over urban communities
A pheromone is a natural scent that an insect produces in very small quantities to communicate with a potential mate .
In the case of the aerial spray , the pheromone works by confusing the male moth , which disrupts the mating cycle , thereby decreasing or eradicating the pest population .
Several rounds of aerial spraying with ‘ CheckMate LBAM-F’ , and ‘ CheckMate OLR - F’ , have already blanketed Monterey and Santa Cruz counties in September through to November 2007 with the insect pheromone , and further sprays planned for June 2008 have been temporarily halted by the courts until after 17 August 2008 when test results from the spray formula are expected [ 4 ] .
The counties of Alameda , Albany , Contra Costa , Marin , Santa Clara , San Mateo , San Francisco , Solano , and Oakland are fresh targets for the summer aerial spraying campaign in 2008 .
The CDFA and USDA have identified the LBAM as a Class ‘ A ’ pest to obtain an “ emergency exemption ” from the California Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , and both claim that synthetic pheromones are not toxic to humans or to the environment .
However , a report from a Task Force set up by the city of Albany , California has provided evidence to the contrary [ 5 ] .
The report states that , “ Following the spraying in Monterey and Santa Cruz in 2007 , there were more than 600 reports of health problems , including asthma - like attacks and difficulty breathing , chest pains , headaches , blurred vision , swollen glands , skins rashes , and feelings of chronic fatigue . ”
The symptoms reported by Monterey and Santa Cruz residents are consistent with the known health effects of several of the ten ingredients found in the pheromone formula .
Matthew Sluder of the Sustainable Health Institute [ 6 ] recently outlined his concerns to the Marin Country Agricultural officer and to the Integrated Pest Management Commission of two of CheckMate ’s published ingredients [ 7 ] :
Butylated hydroxytoluene is mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells , also for bacteria and / or yeast .
Repeated or prolonged exposure can produce organ damage and may be toxic to blood , central nervous system ( CNS ) and liver [ 8 ] .
2 - hydroxy -4-n-octyloxybenzophenone is a xenochemical that binds to estrogen receptors in humans and animals .
Even small doses will signal specific biological action in the body .
Prolonged disruption the endocrine system is a cause of breast cancer [ 9 ] .
CheckMate OLR - F® also contains ( E ) - 11 - tetradecen - 1 - yl acetate and ( Z ) - 11 - tetradecen - 1 - yl acetate as the active ingredients ( A.I.s ) ; while CheckMate LBAM-F ® and DISRUPT Micro - Flake® , contain in addition to ( E ) - 11 - tetradecen - 1 - yl acetate and ( Z ) - 11 - tetradecen - 1 - yl acetate , ( E , E ) - 9,11 - tetradecadien - 1 - yl acetate .
All formulations include the ‘ inert ’ ingredients , Polymethylene Polyphenyl Isocyanate ( PPI ) , Tricapryl Methyl Ammonium Chloride and 1 , 2 - benzisothiazolin - 3 - one [ 7 ] .
The EPA ’s claim that these chemicals are inert fails to disclose the fact that these substances are toxic .
Inert ingeredients are chemical formulations that accompany the main chemicals responsible for eradicating the pest , in this case the pheromones .
Registration of the synthetic pheromones themselves seems to be a dangerously cursory process , in which data relating to toxicity , mutagenicity , allergenicity or teratogenicity may be waived if the substance is a member of a well characterized chemical group in the major OECD countries including the United States [ 10 ] .
In general , the registration of the synthetic pheromones seems to be slipshod and inadequate .
A recent study on CheckMate LBAM - F® by the Aquatic Toxicology Laboratory at UC confirms the danger of aerial application [ 11 ] particularly from the ‘ inert ’ microcapsules ranging in size from approximately 10 microns to 190 microns .
According to the American Lung Association ( ALA ) [ 12 ] microcapsules in the region of 10 microns come under the category of ‘ Particle Pollution ’ defined by the ALA as a combination of fine solids and aerosols that are suspended in the air we breathe and are small enough to lodge deep in the lungs where they can do serious damage .
Particle Pollution is well documented for its adverse effects on short and long term health , including the increased severity of asthma attacks in children , damage to the small airways of the lungs and dying from lung cancer , respiratory and cardiovascular causes .
Children and the elderly are most at risk from these ingredients .
Severe reactions ignored
One eleven month old infant called Jack had such a severe reaction after the first aerial spraying in Monterey that his father Air Force Major Tim Wilcox called a military doctor [ 13 ] .
The boy was hospitalized on three occasions and stopped breathing on one occasion .
The previously healthy child spent his first birthday on medication and oxygen and is now permanently on medication .
Major Wilcox ’s letters and complaints to the state about the possible bad reaction to the spraying were ignored .
CDFA spokesman Steve Lyle said his agency had received 330 complaints of spray - related illness but he downplayed the news , insisting that “ the agencies with the jurisdiction to review the product have told us it ’s safe to use .... and the CheckMate products were unlikely the cause of the illnesses reported . ”
California ’s Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger supports the urban spraying liquid and backs the CDFA ’s position on the spray being safe [ 7 ] .
California State ’s official emergency exemption under Section 18 of the Federal Insecticide , Fungicide and Rodenticide Act has allowed CheckMate LBAM-F , and CheckMate OLR- F to bypass the normal vetting processes to assess safety under California law .
This effectively allows a substance that has not been thoroughly tested to be used in urban areas , and despite the manufacturer Suterra LLC of Bend , Oregan admission that “ long term studies on the active ingredients have not been done ” [ 14 ] .
Further aerial onslaughts of the LBAM are to be coupled with “ complementary techniques ” such as ground treatments and foliar sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis ( bt ) [ 2 ] , a bacterium known to have adverse health effects on human and animal populations ( see More Illnesses Linked to Bt Crops [ 15 ] .
It also infects open sores or abrasions of people with weak immune systems from age , HIV infection , or from treatment for autoimmune diseases [ 16 ] .
Spinosad is a natural insecticide obtained from bacteria ( synthetic Spinosad derivatives are also available ) that is to be applied to areas of LBAM infestation .
Even though Spinosad is approved for organic production , laboratory experiments showed that it was harmful to honeybees and bumblebees .
Later experiments showed that dried residues of the natural insecticide are not harmful to bees [ 17 ] .
But as the bees are already stressed and threatened by colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) see Saving the Honeybee Through Organic Farming [ 18 ] it is advisable to apply the natural insecticide , if at all , only at night when bees are not foraging .
Elephants are white mice
In modern toxicology the adverse effects of pesticides is evaluated by exposing test animals and carefully evaluating the impact of the pesticide .
Most testing is done with either rats or mice .
In the case of the Lepidopteran ( moth ) pheromones , there is clear evidence that pheromones similar if not identical to those delivered from the air in California are active in inducing aggression and sexual arousal in the African elephant .
The female elephant excretes the pheromone in her urine and the smell of that urine arouses male elephants [ 19 , 20 , and 21 ] .
The elephants should be regarded as the white mice , as their response is relevant , not only to elephants that might be in the Bay Area but a large array of mammals including humans .
Male sexual aggression should be considered a marker and evaluated from police records in the communities sprayed with insect pheromone from the air .
Both vertebrate and invertebrate animals are influenced by pheromones similar to those sprayed in California .
Higher primates and humans have retained many of the genes specifying pheromone receptors of ‘ lower ’ vertebrates as inactive pseudo - genes , though humans have retained active pheromone receptor genes as well [ 22 , 23 ] .
The safety of a synthetic cockroach sex pheromone was questioned when it was found to be toxic to human cells [ 24 ] .
It would be prudent to presume all synthetic pheromones toxic to humans until fully evaluated for toxicity and unintended behaviour modification .
Olfaction and pheromones are well documented to be a part of human behaviour [ 25 , 26 ] .
According to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation ( CDPR ) US EPA states that “ Based on low toxicity in animal testing , and expected low exposures to humans , no risk to human health is expected from the use of these pheromones .
During more than 10 years of use of lepidopteran pheromones , no adverse effects have been reported .
The safety record for lepidopteran pheromones has allowed the Agency to conclude that consumption of food containing residues of the pheromones presents no risk .
...
Adverse effects on non target organisms ( mammals , birds , and aquatic organisms ) are not expected because these pheromones are released in very small amounts to the environment and act on a select group of insects . ”
For that reason little motoring of non-target effects was undertaken even though the toxicity of the pheromone to invertebrate organisms and fish was noted by CDPR .
The ‘ inert ingredients ’ , were of no toxicological concern according to CDPR [ 27 ] .
However , had they examined the actual ; ‘ inert ’ ingredients ’ they would have observed that more than on such ingredient posed a risk to human health .
Sex hormone makes manufacturer millions
The “ organic biopesticides ” market is specifically designed to target organic farmers in the US and Canada who can use
Bt and pheromones on the premise that it is based on natural substances without losing their organic status .
The biopesticides market is currently a small fraction of the overall $ 30 billion pesticides industry .
By 2010 , it is estimated to be worth $ 1 billion [ 28 ] .
It is also estimated that each aerial spray of CheckMate LBAM-F and CheckMate OLR - F® is worth $ 3 million paid directly to the manufacturer Suterra LLC [ 9 ] .
Initially the US EPA did not approve biopesticide use , but they appear to have slipped through the regulatory net along with GM crops .
Health Canada , the federal department responsible for helping Canadians maintain and improve their health has approved the aerial spraying of a Bt formula Foray 48b to control the Gipsy Moth ( Lymantria dispar ) .
The manufacturer Valent BioSciences ’ material safety data sheet [ 29 ] states that the “ inert ingredients – identity withheld as a Trade Secret ” are not known to be absorbed by the skin , or cause inhalation or ingestion problems .
The same sheet warns that Foray 48 b could possibly irritate target organs , skin , eyes and respiratory tract and goggles and overalls should be used when in contact with it .
In West Auckland , New Zealand , an urban population was subject to aerial spray of Bt Foray 48 b for moth eradication during cycles of 2 - 3 weeks for over 2 years .
This was part of multimillion dollar aerial spray campaign between 1996 and 2004 in New Zealand .
A ‘ People ’s Inquiry ’ set up by those whose health was adversely affected by the spray has received support from the independent Ombudsman [ 30 ] .
There is major concern for the welfare not just of humans and animals , not just for bees , but also for butterflies , and particularly bats , all which are major pollinators of food crops and natural insect predators .
Bats are now under significant threat from pesticides [ 31 ] .
Organic farmers told chemical treatment safe
Ground treatments with Bt , and Spinosad may be utilized in conjunction with aerial pheromone spraying in areas in California where moth larvae have been detected [ 32 ] .
Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis ) kills insects by forming a protein crystal that the bugs ingest .
The proteins rip through the innards of insects that go through a worm stage , said Olav Messerschmidt , executive director of the Biopesticide Industry Alliance [ 28 ] .
The formulations of these products are approved for use on organic crops in the USA , Canada and elsewhere .
This has encouraged use by organic farmers and growers in California , who are also told by the National Organic Program ( NOP ) that they support the combined synthetic pheromone and bt treatment .
However , it transpires that the California Certified Organic Farmers ( CCOF ) has not researched or read , or been provided with any information on CheckMate other than from the NOP or the CDFA .
Peggy Miers , the Executive Director of the CCOF said “ We are not a health organization and we are not an environment organization , our mission is organic and other organizations will address the health aspects … and environmental aspects .
Our needs are to address the needs of our members and the organic marketplace . ” [ 33 ] .
Most opponents of aerial spraying hesitate to question the safety of the pheromones , yet they agree that the additives to the spray mixture ( above ) are well known to cause the kinds of symptoms observed in Monterey and Santa Cruz [ 4 ] .
The Californian Alliance to Stop the Spray ( CASS ) and the Environment and Human Rights Advisory highlight twenty three human rights violations of internationally accepted codes of ethics by the enforced spraying programme that may incur liabilities for the CDPR [ 34 ] .
CDPR assurances unreliable - synthetic pheromones lack adequate study
It appears that the CDPR has not been entirely honest in expressing their opinion of the aerial spray mixture .
They seem to have neglected the well documented toxicity of some spray additives .
This has resulted in the reluctance to fully evaluate the impact of the aerial spray on a very large population exposed to the spray .
The evidence on the toxicity of the spray additives was clear while the toxicity of the synthetic pheromones is not yet thoroughly studied .
There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the synthetic insect pheromones may also be active in mammals and probably in humans .
In the fullness of time , it is likely that the synthetic insect hormones will be seen to have behavioural and cellular impacts on vertebrates and humans .
Presently , these impacts have been documented in a few cases , but the field is advancing rapidly .
Meanwhile , bureaucrats are using the absence of evidence as evidence of the absence of harm .

The Murdoch clan is used to the rest of the media , politicians and the chattering classes trying to decode their political stance and its implications from their public actions .
The early signals were that Rupert Murdoch favoured Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election .
But yesterday Murdoch - watchers were digesting the news that Elisabeth Murdoch , Rupert 's 39 - year - old daughter , who runs a large TV production company , will host a London fundraiser for Clinton 's rival , Barack Obama , this month .
Despite the extensive coverage in the UK media , for high - rolling US expats election fever must seem a long way away .
But in the most high - profile example yet of glitzy fundraising bashes for the US presidential hopefuls spreading across the Atlantic , a string of notable US expats with jobs in media , the arts and finance will gather at the Notting Hill home Murdoch shares with her husband , the PR guru Matthew Freud .
So -called " event chairs " at the fundraising evening on April 28 include Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow , Warner Brothers UK chief Josh Berger and Julia Moffett , the director of strategy for the BBC World Service Trust .
Hosts at the bash , VIP tickets for which cost $ 2,300 ( £ 1,160 ) , include Joanna Shields , the international president of popular social networking site Bebo , which was recently sold to AOL .
Those who have already donated to the campaign are invited to " top up " their donation to the maximum $ 2,300 allowed under US law .

His backing is assiduously courted by politicians around the world , with his choices often decided by expediency , and both Labour and the Conservatives are working on securing the backing of his newspapers in time for the next general election .

POLL : Obama Surges on Electability , Challenges Clinton on Leadership Poll shows Obama ahead as the candidate Dems see as most likely to win .
April 16 , 2008  -- Barack Obama has knocked down one of the three tent poles of Hillary Clinton 's campaign for president , surging ahead of her as the candidate Democrats see as most likely to win in November .
He 's challenging her on leadership as well , leaving only experience as a clear Clinton advantage in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll .
On the eve of their debate before the Pennsylvania primary next week , Democrats by a 2 - 1 margin , 62 - 31 percent , now see Obama as better able to win in November -- a dramatic turn from February , when Clinton held a scant 5 - point edge on this measure , and more so from last fall , when she crushed her opponents on electability .
The poll finds other pronounced problems for Clinton .
Among all Americans , 58 percent now say she 's not honest and not trustworthy , 16 points higher than in a precampaign poll two years ago .
Obama beats her head - to - head on this attribute by a 23 - point margin .
The number of Americans who see Clinton unfavorably overall has risen to a record high in ABC / Post polling , 54 percent -- up 14 points since January .
Obama 's unfavorable score has reached a new high as well , up 9 points , but to a lower 39 percent .
A favorability rating is the most basic measure of any public figure 's popularity ; it 's trouble when unfavorable views outscore favorable ones .
That 's now the case for Clinton , alone among the current candidates .
There are other strong signs of the toll of the long Democratic campaign .
The number of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents who describe the tone of the contest as " mostly negative " has risen by 14 points since February , from 27 percent then to 41 percent now .
Those who say so mainly blame Clinton over Obama , by nearly a 4 - 1 margin , 52 percent to 14 percent .
( An additional 25 percent blame both equally . )
In a similar result , half of Democrats say their candidates are " arguing about things that really are n't that important " rather than discussing real issues .
The candidates are at or near dead heats in trust to handle a range of issues , including the economy , the war in Iraq , international trade and terrorism .
Clinton 's lack of a significant advantage on these , despite her wide edge on experience , is another challenge .
Obama , meanwhile , has largely succeeded in moving past the controversial comments made by the former minister of his church , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright ; 59 percent of all adults , and 72 percent of leaned Democrats , approve of the way Obama has distanced himself from Wright .
( Nearly half of Democrats , however , are concerned the Republicans will use the Wright imbroglio effectively against Obama if he is nominated . )
Nor does the controversy over Obama 's remark calling some voters " bitter " seem to have hurt ; his favorability rating , though down from January , lost no ground across the nights this poll was done ( Thursday through Sunday ) as the issue gained volume .
Equally problematic for Clinton in all this is the bottom line : Democrats by 51 - 41 percent say they 'd like to see Obama win the nomination , his biggest advantage to date .
FIGHT ON – Yet most Democrats are also willing to see Clinton fight on ; 55 percent say she should stay in the race even if she loses Pennsylvania .
One reason is that about as many , 53 percent , say it 's more important to them that their candidate wins , even if that means a longer race .
Another factor is that most Democrats reject the notion that the long campaign will damage their chances in November .
While 32 percent share this view , more , 67 percent , believe that ultimately the length of the race either wo n't make much difference in the general election ( 50 percent ) or will end up helping the Democrats ' cause ( 17 percent ) .
But there is an indication that the increasingly contentious race is taking a toll :
In this poll , 35 percent of Americans identify themselves as Democrats , down from 40 percent last month and the lowest percentage since the primary season began .
DELEGATES – There 's a brighter result for Clinton in preferences on how Democratic " superdelegates " should choose a candidate .
Only 13 percent of Democrats say superdelegates should support whoever 's won the most regular delegates in primaries and caucuses -- a count in which Obama 's ahead , and seemingly likely to stay so .
Instead a plurality , 46 percent , say superdelegates should support the candidate who's won the most popular votes , a tally in which Clinton still has hopes .
And 37 percent say superdelegates should go with their own sense of which candidate they think is best .
( Democrats who favor relying on the popular vote broadly prefer that it be based on the national vote , not the vote within each superdelegate 's home state .
Either way , whether to count uncontested Florida and Michigan remains a vexing point . )
DEM DAMAGE ?
– Significant numbers of Democrats currently say they 'd defect to Republican John McCain if their candidate loses the nomination ; in this poll , 21 percent of Obama 's supporters , and 23 percent of Clinton 's say they 'd jump to McCain .
But that 's a result worthy of caution ; it 's hardly an opportune time -- in the midst of the Democrats ' continuing food fight , with their dander up -- to put much stock in the result .
Still , it 's clear that the Democrats ' eventual nominee will have some persuading to do within the party as well as without .
A potentially greater threat than crossover voting is that disaffected Democrats might simply sit out the general election .
Another gauge underscores the point : Just 61 percent of Obama supporters say they 'd definitely or probably vote for Clinton if she wins the nomination ; 38 percent say they definitely or probably would not .
It 's very similar among Clinton supporters : Sixty - one percent say they'd be inclined to vote for Obama , 35 percent definitely or probably not .
Among core Democrats -- excluding Democratic - leaning independents -- about a third on each side say they 're disinclined to kiss and make up .
That would be a highly unusual -- perhaps unprecedented -- level of party defections .
From 1992 - 2004 just 10 or 11 percent of Democrats have voted Republican .
In 1988 Mike Dukakis yielded 17 percent of Democrats ; in 1980 and 1984 , Ronald Reagan attracted a quarter of Democrats .
Any significant defections of disenchanted Democrats to McCain would be a concern to the Democratic nominee .
It 's a balance worth watching -- but one that will be more meaningfully measured after the Democrats pick their candidate and lick their wounds .
There 's also the possibility of GOP crossover : Fourteen percent of Republicans say they 'd vote for Obama if he 's the nominee ; fewer , 7 percent , say they 'd cross over for Clinton .
As noted , there are other concerns for Democrats -- the level of Democratic partisanship , and also whether Republican allegiance will recover .
On average across 2007 just 25 percent of Americans identified themselves as Republicans , the lowest percentage since 1984 .
So far this year it 's ticked up to 28 percent on average ; in this poll , 29 percent .
NOVEMBER –
As things stand , this poll suggests a close general election contest .
Obama has a scant 5 - point advantage over McCain , 49 - 44 percent , compared with a 52 - 40 percent race last month .
McCain and Clinton stand at 48 - 45 percent ; it was a Clinton advantage , 50 - 44 percent , last month .
One factor is the shift in partisan affiliation .
Another , in the McCain - Clinton matchup , is independents , one of the key swing voter groups .
Last month , Clinton had a 7 - point edge among independents ; now it 's a 10 - point McCain advantage .
( Obama continues to lead McCain among independents , by 8 points . )
All the candidates have vulnerabilities .
McCain 's major speech on the economy this week was likely aimed at his comparative weakness in this area ; among voters who say the economy is their top concern he trails Obama ( by 53 - 39 percent ) and Clinton ( by 51 - 42 percent ) alike .
And the economy is the top issue by far , cited by 41 percent ; the war in Iraq follows , cited by 18 percent as their chief concern .
In another measure , Americans by 55 - 34 percent say a Democratic president would do a better job than a Republican handling the economy ; and by 52 - 35 percent also believe a Democrat would do a better job dealing with the situation in Iraq .
McCain 's age -- he'd be the first president to take office at 72 -- is also a continued negative ; 26 percent say it makes them " less enthusiastic " about supporting his candidacy , including 13 percent of Republicans and 24 percent of independents .
That is , however , down slightly from its high , 31 percent in January .
Nearly half of Americans , 48 percent , also think McCain 's temperament would hurt his ability to serve effectively as president .
But 51 percent say Obama 's level of experience would hurt him , and 49 percent say Clinton would be damaged by her political style .
Each is a broad enough concern for the candidates to take notice .
FAVORABILITY – Clinton and Obama are not alone in their higher unfavorability ratings .
McCain 's unfavorable score , similarly , has gained 10 points since January , to 40 percent ; and Bill Clinton 's has advanced about as much , to 51 percent , its worst since he left office .
Both Clintons stand out in the level of antipathy they attract .
Thirty - nine percent of Americans have a " strongly " unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton ( up 10 points since January ) ; fewer , 22 percent , have a " strongly " favorable view ( down 10 points ) .
Thirty - four percent are strongly negative on Bill Clinton .
ATTRIBUTES – Hillary Clinton , naturally , does much better on favorability in her own party ( 29 percent unfavorable among leaned Democrats versus Obama 's 21 percent ) .
But she 's got trouble versus Obama on several specific personal attributes , which matter especially in primaries , with candidates relatively close on the issues .
Obama now leads Clinton , as noted , by 62 - 31 percent as having the better chance of winning in November ; he also owns the " change " mantra , leading by 56 - 35 percent as the one who'd " do more to bring needed change to Washington . "
And he leads by 53 - 30 percent as more honesty and trustworthy ; even among women , a more pro-Clinton group , Obama leads on trustworthiness by a 16 - point margin ( it 's 35 points among men ) .
It 's a close Obama +5 on the candidate who " better understands the problems of people like you , " with men and women dividing , and an equally close Clinton +5 on being the stronger leader -- an attribute on which Clinton was +24 in February , and +41 back in September against Obama and John Edwards combined .
Clinton , then , is down to a broad advantage on only one attribute tested in this poll -- having the better experience , on which she leads Obama by 67 - 24 percent .
The question is whether it 's enough .
METHODOLOGY – This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone April 10 - 13 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,197 adults , including an oversample of African - Americans for a total of 213 and an oversample of Catholics for a total of 292 ( both weighted to their correct share of the national population ) .
The results have a 3 - point error margin for the full sample , 4 points for the 643 leaned Democrats .
Sampling , data collection and tabulation by TNS of Horsham , Pa .
It ’s not exactly “ Halo 3 , ” and it wo n’t be found on the shelves at GameStop , but a new “ serious gaming ” simulation from IBM has hit the computer labs at the USC Marshall School of Business , training students in the rudiments of business - process management .
BPM , as the term is abbreviated , analyzes the way organizations carry out specific processes , such as how a bank might handle the workflow when a customer sets up a checking account .
Streamlining and rationalizing complex processes , or reconciling conflicting processes when companies undergo structural changes such as mergers , has become an important field in the business world .
But finding enough talented people who can employ BPM techniques is difficult , says Sharon McFadden , who heads the IBM Software Group ’s academic initiative in 10 Western states .
IBM , one of the world ’s largest consultants , ca n’t find enough people to fill its BPM jobs .
And many other companies face the same scramble for BPM - savvy employees .
“ There ’s a specific skills - set gap in the market , ” McFadden says .
“ We ’re looking for people with cross - disciplinary skills ” who can use BPM tools to help improve company operations .
So IBM decided to it was time to create more BPM - knowledgeable job candidates at the university level .
It created a computer simulation , which the company prefers to call “ serious gaming , ” that walks students through situations a BPM specialist might face .
McFadden praised USC Marshall ’s leadership for being open to such innovative ways to teach complex issues , an openness she said was all too rare at other universities .
The game , called “ Innov8 , ” opens on a stormy day at AFTER Inc. , which has just undergone a merger .
The player is called into the CEO ’s office and told to figure out which of AFTER ’s processes need immediate overhauls because of their importance to the company ’s success .
Students then move through AFTER ’s offices , meeting with key employees in departments such as Operations , Human Resources and Information Technology .
Students rely on a “ heat map ” to pinpoint and fine tune the processes most likely to save money , generate revenue and improve customer service .
The production values on “ Innov8 ” do n’t match the chip - melting processor demands of today ’s high - end videogames , an important concession given the modest graphic capabilities of most computers in educational and business settings .
But the game does provide an engaging alternative to the standard textbook and lecture approach , said Amy Ward , an assistant professor in USC Marshall ’s Department of Information and Operations Management and one of several USC Marshall professors incorporating the technology into their Operations 311 classes .
“ One thing that I like is that you say things in the classroom and you want to convey that these are things the companies actually do , ” said Ward .
One good way to convey that is having a troupe of IBM specialists on campus for the rollout of “ Innov8 , ” as happened the first week of the spring semester at USC Marshall , Ward said .
Her biggest challenge with “ Innova8 , ” whose initial scenarios were only completed in late 2007 , is figuring out when the simulator can be most effectively deployed , at the beginning , end or in smaller sections throughout the course of a semester .
IBM expects to develop additional scenarios in coming months for “ Innov8 ” to expand its applicability and usefulness .
The partnership with IBM is part of a broader USC Marshall effort – led by Director of Corporate Relations Cathy Fuller – to connect the school more deeply with a few dozen major companies on multiple levels , from classroom speakers and field trips , hiring and internships for students and data access , case - competition material and consulting and research opportunities for professors .
As it is , IBM has been collaborating for some time with professors such as USC Viterbi ’s Ellis Horowitz and USC Marshall ’s Ann Majchrzak , said McFadden .
The serious gaming initiative is has proven another excellent opportunity to deepen the relationship between university and company .
Still , what do we know about the effects of , say , 15 to 20 years of antidepressant drug treatment that begins in adolescence or childhood ?
Not enough .

The reason has to do with the way drugs are tested and approved .
To get F.D.A. approval , a drug has to beat a placebo in two randomized clinical trials that typically involve a few hundred subjects who are treated for relatively short periods , usually 4 to 12 weeks .
So drugs are approved based on short - term studies for what turns out to be long - term  often lifelong  use in the world of clinical practice .
The longest maintenance study to date of one of the newer antidepressants , Effexor , lasted only two years and showed the drug to be superior to a placebo in preventing relapses of depression .
What do I say to a depressed patient who is doing well after five years on such a drug but ca n’t stop without a depressive relapse and who wants reassurance that the drug has no long - term adverse effects ?
I usually say that we have no evidence that the drug poses a risk with long - term use ; and since the risk of untreated depression is much greater than the hypothetical risk of the drug , it makes sense to stay on it .
This large gap in our clinical knowledge is compounded by the public ’s growing and well - founded skepticism about research sponsored by drug makers .
A study in the January 2008 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine , involving 74 clinical trials with 12 antidepressants , found that 97 percent of positive studies were published , versus 12 percent of negative studies .
Clearly , physicians and the public need much better data on the safety and efficacy of drugs after they hit the market , which at present consists mainly of anecdotes and case reports .
Wave goodbye to the nine to five , and say hello to virtual enterprise
Within a decade millions of workers will be at home juggling their careers with caring for children and older relatives , Britain 's leading management institute forecast yesterday .
Dreams of a future when technological advances would liberate us from the daily drudge and allow more time for leisure appear to be fading , with futurologists predicting less talk about " work - life balance " and more about " work - life integration " .
A report on the nature of employment in 2018 predicts an exodus from the traditional workplace caused partly by environmental pressure to reduce the carbon footprint of commuting and partly by the demographic pressure of an ageing population , with fewer employees able to avoid looking after older relatives , leading to a blurring of boundaries between family and career .
In a list of scenarios drawn up by the Chartered Management Institute and launched at a seminar in London yesterday by Sir John Sunderland , chairman of Cadbury Schweppes , companies were warned to prepare for a range of more remote possibilities , including a world under cyber attack , the use of holograms for communication between staff , and controlling employee behaviour by implanting microchips in their brains .
More probable scenarios included a polarisation of businesses , with large corporations consolidating global control and becoming more powerful than the governments of some big countries .
But there would also be a proliferation of " virtual " companies , often small community - based enterprises without conventional business premises .
These enterprises would have to compete for employees , who will become more footloose and less inclined to work for an organisation that does not allow individuals to tailor the working day to meet their personal requirements .
" Organisations will have to address the growing power of the employee , " the report said .
Whether or not workers enjoy this extra flexibility , they will not be allowed to cling to traditional patterns of employment .
" On all levels there will be a move towards upskilling and multi-skilling ...
Employees will be required to be more flexible with regard to organisational needs , " the report said .
This may mean workers abandoning traditional shifts .
People may work from home on assignments during specific time slots , or be available on call when work needs to be done .
They will communicate by high - speed broadband , perhaps supplemented by hologram technology permitting virtual presence at meetings .
Many talented people would become " multi-employed " , some working for a day or two a week in " third place locations " outside their organisations or home office .
As work becomes more project - based , people will need to use specialised services to market themselves for individual ad hoc projects .
Managers will have to create multicultural work teams , operating remotely , combining the skills of older and younger workers .
As social changes from the past 30 years take root , women will move into higher management positions .
Emotional intelligence and the ability to appreciate people 's values as much as their technical competencies will be seen by recruiters as increasingly important .
Futurologists may have predicted some of these changes , but the institute said its report was the first attempt by captains of industry and commerce to predict how their organisations may look 10 years in the future .
It said collaborative working would become so important that companies should consider abolishing positions and job titles .
" Instead each employee should be seen as a valuable resource , to be employed according to specific organisational needs . "
Companies would come to regard wisdom as a valuable resource .
Some would try to nurture an organisational memory by arranging rituals and storytelling , and listening to the accounts of long - term employees .
The institute put findings from the report to more than 1,000 senior executives .
It found 74 % expected " virtual teams of employees " , working at a distance from each other , to become the norm by 2018 .
About 64 % thought talented people would become " multi-employed , " 59 % said job hopping would be commonplace and 56 % said most routine tasks would be automated .
Two - thirds of the executives expected global corporations to exert more influence than governments .
Almost as many forecast an increase in customer participation in business decisions and the creation of products with longer life cycles to meet environmental concerns .
There was less support for the futurologists ' technological projections .
Only 31 % expected to communicate with staff by hologram and 12 % thought companies would enhance the capabilities of staff by implanting microchips in their brains .
Mary Chapman , the institute 's chief executive , said : " Looking ahead 10 years , it is clear that the successful organisations will be those who can do more than embrace change - they will anticipate , identify and drive it ...
" A greater degree of emotional intelligence will be required by managers and leaders so they can understand how people work and their likely reaction to change .
They will also need to shift from today 's input - driven approach to a focus on output , achievement and a better integration between work and personal lives . "
Brave new world : Surprise scenarios for the future
Businesses are urged to prepare for 16 " surprise scenarios " that could change their future .
The report acknowledges these may not be the most accurate predictions of the world in 2018 , but says businesses should be ready for possibilities including :
A brain - enhanced world
By 2018 , businesses will routinely use microchips to enhance employees ' abilities .
Chips will be implanted in brains to enhance memory or knowledge , but may also monitor and control behaviour .
Companies should think about the use and misuse of such technologies .
A world ruled by employees
Successful organisations will realise their strength lies in their workforce .
Shareholders will lose their right to all the profits and companies will hand power to employees .
Many organisations will be designed as " guilds " whose mission is to support employees .
" This development may spread slowly or suddenly through angry protest , " the institute said .
Managers should prepare by rethinking business and " managing power structures prudently " .
A world under cyber attack
Terrorists will attack the internet and computer systems , halting work globally with a virus that diffuses through corporate firewalls , deleting huge quantities of business data .
Safety measures turn out to be insufficient - businesses lose organisational memories , intangible assets and intellectual property .
The institute said companies should prepare red-alert detection systems to raise a " virtual dam " against attack .
Multiple back - ups in intellectual property banks are recommended .
A world run by robots
Robots with artificial intelligence will be put into management positions .
They will not necessary have heads and arms .
Software decision - making - already used in financial management - will increase dependence on systems .
" Regular updates on such developments and building up a knowledge base about the use and misuse of them may be an appropriate precaution , " the institute said .
A world without the rat race
Young people will refuse " meaningless jobs " on a mass scale .
They will choose ethical careers and not the rat race .
The institute said : " This may tiptoe into the world of work , or it may ... explode into an angry protest movement against the establishment . "
Managers might avert the revolution by sharing power with the younger generation .
In the beginning the Web had ASCII .
And that was good .
But then , not really .
The Europeans and their strange accents were a bit of a problem .
So then the Web had iso - latin1 .
And HTML could be assumed to be using that , by default ( RFC2854 , section 4 ) .
And that was good .
But then , not really .
There was a whole world out there , with a lot of writing systems , tons of different characters .
Many different character encodings …
Today we have Unicode , at long last well adopted in most modern computing systems , and a basic building block of a lot of web technologies .
And although there are still a lot of different characters encoding available for documents on the web , this is not an issue , as there are mechanisms , both in HTTP and within HTML for instance , to declare the encoding used , and help tools determine how to decode the content .
All is not always rosy , however .
The first issue is that there are quite a lot of mechanisms to declare encoding , and that they do n’t necessarily agree .
The second issue is that not everyone can configure a Web server to declare encoding of HTML documents at the HTTP level .
Many sources ,
One encoding
if the box says “ dangerous , do not open ” , do n’t peek inside the box …
A long ( web ) time ago , there was a very serious discussion to try and determine a Web resource was supposed to know its encoding best , or whether the Web server should be the authoritative source .
In the “ resource ” camp , some were pushing the rather logical argument that a specific document surely knew best about its own metadata that a misconfigured Web server .
Who cares if the server thinks that all HTML document it serves are iso - 8859 - 1 , when I , as document author , know full well that I am authoring this particular resource as utf - 8 ?
The other camp had two killer arguments .
The first , and perhaps the simplest , argument was : what ’s the point of having user agents sniff garbage in hope to find content , and perhaps a character encoding declaration , when the transport protocol has a way of declaring it ?
This is the basis for the authoritative metadata principle .
This principle is also sometimes summarized as :
If I want to show an HTML document as plain text source , rather than have it interpreted by browsers , I should be able to do so .
I should be able to serve any document as text / plain if that is my choice .
The second killer argument was transcoding .
A lot of proxies , they said , transform the content they proxy , sometimes from a character encoding to another .
So even though a document might say “ I am encoded in iso - 2022 - jp “ , the proxy should be able to say “ actually , trust me , the content I am delivering to you is in utf - 8 “ .
In the end , the apparent consensus was that the “ server knows best ” camp had the sound architectural arguments behind them , and so , for everything on the web served via the HTTP protocol , HTTP has precedence over any other method in determining the encoding ( and content type , etc. ) of resources .
This means that regardless of what is in an ( x ) html document , if the server says “ this is a text / html document encoded as utf - 8 “ , user agents should follow that information .
Second guessing is likely to cause more harm than good .
Unlabeled boxes can be full of treasures , or full or trouble
But what if there is no character encoding declared at the HTTP level ?
This is where it gets tricky .
“ Old school ” HTML introduced a specific meta tag for the declaration of the encoding within the document :
< META http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=ISO - 8859-5 " >
Over the years , we have seen that this method was plagued by two serious issues :
Its syntax .
Nobody seems to get it right ( it is just … too complicated ! ) and the Web is littered with approximate , sometimes comical , variants of this syntax .
This is no laughing matter for user agents , however , which ca n’t even expect to find this encoding declaration properly marked up !
The meta elements have to be within the head of a document , but there is no guarantee that it will be anywhere near the top of the document .
the head of a document can have lots of other metadata , title , description , scripts and stylesheeets , before declaring the encoding .
This means a lot of sniffing and pseudo - parsing of undecoded garbage .
In some cases , it can have dreadful consequences , such as security flaws in the approximate sniffing code .
It is worth noting that current work on html5 tries to work around these issues by providing a simpler alternate syntax , and making sure that the declaration of encoding should be present at the very beginning of the head .
XML , on the other hand , had a way to declare encoding at the document level in the XML declaration .
The good thing about that being that this declaration MUST be at the very beginning of the document , which alleviates the pain of having to sniff the content .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
The XML specification also defines , in its Appendix F , a recommended algorithm for the encoding detection .
The Recipe
Given all these potential sources for the declaration ( or automatic detection ) of the document character encoding , all potentially contradicting the others , what should be the recipe to reliably figure out which encoding to use ?
The charset info in the HTTP Content - Type header should have precedence .
Always Next in line is the charset information in the XML declaration .
Which may be there , or may not .
For XHTML documents , and in particular for the XHTML documents served as text / html , it is recommended to avoid using an XML declaration .
But let ’s remember : XHTML is XML , and XML requires an XML declaration or some other method of declaration for XML documents using encodings other than UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 ( or ascii , which is a convenient subset … ) .
As a result , there is a strong likeliness that anything served as application / xhtml+xml ( or text / html and looking a lot like XHTML ) , with neither encoding declaration at the HTTP level nor in an XML declaration is quite likely to be UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 Then there is the BOM , a signature for Unicode character encodings .
Then comes the search for the meta information that might , just might , provide a character encoding declaration .
Beyond that point , it ’s the land of defaults and heuristics .
You may choose to default to iso - 8859 - 1 for text / html resources , utf - 8 for application / xhtml+xml .
The rest is heuristics .
You could venture towards fallback encodings such as windows - 1252 , which many consider a safe bet , but a bet nonetheless .
There are quite a few algorithms to determine the likeliness of one specific encoding based on matching at byte level .
Martin Dürst wrote a regexp to check whether a document will “ fit ” as utf - 8 .
If you know other reliable algorithms , feel free to mention them in the comments , I will list them here .
Does this seem really ugly and complicated to you ?
You will love the excellent Encoding Divination Flow Chart by Philip Semanchuk , the developer of the Web quality checker “ Nikita the spider ” .
Or , if this is still horribly fuzzy after looking at the flow chart , why not let a tool do that for you ?
The HTML :: Encoding perl module by Björn Höhrmann does just that .
Last word … for HTML authors
If you create content on the Web and never have to read and parse content on the web , and if you have read that far , you are probably considering yourself very lucky right now .
But you can make a difference by making sure the content you put on the web is using consistent character encodings , and declare them properly .
Your job is actually much easier than the tricky winding road to determining a document ’s encoding .
In the proverbial three steps :
The UN Security Council just passed a third set of sanctions against Iran ostensibly because it refuses to cease and desist enriching uranium .
In truth it was informed by another issue both more immediate and intimidating .
On February 22 the International Atomic Energy Agency issued what seemed like a passing grade to Iran 's nuclear program .
But shortly before that , its chief of weapons inspection , Olli Heinonen , exhibited approximately 1,000 documents and videos to an array of ambassadors and experts in Vienna .
They 'd been downloaded from a laptop described by the Washington Post in 2005 as " allegedly stolen from an Iranian whom German intelligence tried , unsuccessfully , to recruit as an informant [ and ] whisked out of the country by another Iranian . "
Among them were apparent designs for nuclear warheads –- light years more menacing than just the enriched uranium that infuses them .
In response " Iran 's ambassador , Ali Asghar Soltanieh , nearly shouting , called the [ schematics ] baseless fabrications , " William Broad and David Sanger reported for the New York Times .
" Suddenly , the confrontation with Iran had reignited . "
So much for the breather from worrying about the onset of another war that we were enjoying .
Thanks for the hiatus from anxiety , however short - lived , were due the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran that pronounced Iran 's nuclear weapons program inactive .
But it seems to have been relegated to history 's dustbin .
It 's not common knowledge , but , as Broad and Sanger report , the NIE was shaped in part by the bitter complaints of Iran 's scientists about the forced moratorium on warhead design in late 2003 .
Their notes and journals were obtained , in a rare intelligence coup , by the US .
Suddenly " Washington had a narrow but direct conduit into the most tightly held of Iranian secrets .
It was exactly what it lacked in prewar Iraq . "
Disputes , however , ensued over whether it was wise to abandon judging Iran 's nuclear program by its uranium enrichment .
But hidden within the NIE were the very seeds of its own destruction .
In effect , the administration informed the intelligence community , " Fine .
If you do n't want to go the uranium route , no one can bend intelligence to its own purposes better than we can . "
In fact , the laptop itself might be the beneficiary of their expertise .
Could Ambassador Soltanieh 's charges that the laptop material was fabricated be true ?
The only hint Broad and Sanger give is when they mention that the Vienna presentation " disclosed many new details suggesting the depth of Iran 's past work on weapons design . "
[ Emphasis added . ]
They must have forgot that in 2005 they wrote that when the laptop first surfaced in 2003 an IAEA diplomat said of the data , " It looks beautiful [ but ] I can fabricate it . "
Another diplomat , according to the AP , felt that " much of it is of doubtful value . "
Others ' comments included " Relatively insignificant " and " It 's not the amount , but the quality that counts . "
Meanwhile , at Asia Times Online , Kaveh Afrasiabi wrote that " even David Albright , a former weapons inspector [ and no friend of Iran ] admitted that ' so many pieces are missing ' in the US 's allegations " about the laptop .
As the esteemed Gareth Porter sums up in a recent piece , the " laptop of mass destruction " ( ATimes 's headline ) has " been regarded with great suspicion by US and foreign analysts . "
Whatever the truth of the US story about its provenance , Porter reports that German sources claimed the laptop had been provided by Iran 's version of Ahmad Chalabi 's Iraqi National Congress -- the National Council of Resistance of Iran .
Its notorious paramilitary arm , the Mujahideen e-Khalq ( MEK ) , enjoys the dubious distinction of having been declared a terrorist organization by both the US and Iran .
MEK was credited by the West with identifying the Natanz facility as a nuclear site in 2002 .
But , in the interim , when it comes to intelligence on Iran 's nuclear program , it 's drawn blanks , Porter explains .
Still , without naming MEK as its source , the CIA continued to submit its faulty intelligence to the IAEA for the next five years .
File this comment by a former state department official to Porter under understatement : " I think they are without key sources in the Iranian government . "
It 's bad enough that the US was feeding the IAEA intelligence that 's suspect .
However , MEK may not have obtained the laptop from an Iranian , but from Israel 's Mossad .
The rumor has been circulating for some time , but when you hear it from Gareth Porter , it makes substantial inroads into the territory of fact .
Mossad might even have provided MEK with the data on Natanz as well .
In light of its later failures , it figures that MEK may owe its only intelligence success to Mossad .
In the case of the laptop , though , Mossad may have been feeding MEK , the US , and the IAEA misinformation .
In other words , two links in the laptop 's chain of custody -- MEK and the Mossad -- are contaminated by bias .
Yet most damning is a statement that Porter reports Scott Ritter made in an interview elsewhere .
He pointed out that the CIA is able to check the authenticity and chronology of computer files with forensic tests ( obvious when you think about it ) .
" The fact that the [ CIA ] could not rule out the possibility of fabrication , according to Ritter , " Porter reports , " indicates that it had either chosen not to do such tests or that the tests had revealed fraud . "
The Bush administration has no qualms about being branded as liars .
But implicating our European allies and especially the IAEA in our lies is shameful .
Europe , meanwhile , is spooked because it's within range of the Shahab 3 ( which , theoretically , would carry the warheads ) .
Consequently , according to Porter , " Diplomats said the Vienna presentation bolstered the Security Council 's resolve to impose a third round of sanctions . "
Ah , sanctions .
That strange word which , at first glance , holds out the promise of permission and endorsement .
But , of course , in its other guise , a sanction penalizes .
As Soraya Sepahpour - Ulrich writes at CampaignIran.org , sanctions intended for the purpose of " isolating and undermining the government have in reality helped to weaken the social and economic institutions which the country requires if it is to become a viable democracy . "
Not to mention bring us closer to war .
Afrasiabi can see it now :
The latest round of sanctions are " ensuring the [ escalation ] of the Iran nuclear crisis that should have ended .
. . after the IAEA 's certificate of Iran 's compliance . "
Especially " given Tehran 's stated promise to resist ' unlawful ' pressures and demands [ such as ] the interdiction " by US and French ships in and around the Persian Gulf of Iranian ships carrying suspected nuclear cargo .
That 's a design for disaster –- a schematic for doom –- if there ever was one .

Cannot Be Overstated
As Bush celebrated the fifth anniversary of getting to play Commander Guy , this was my favorite of his quotes :
In Iraq , we are witnessing the first large - scale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden , his grim ideology , and his murderous network .
The significance of this development cannot be overstated .
Except , of course , that the significance is overstated by simply attempting to attribute to it any significance at all .
Because Osama bin Laden 's murderous network was n't even in Iraq , before Bush invaded Iraq , so there was no need for any scale of uprising against it .
And bin Laden himself would n't still be out there , anyway , had Bush not let him get away .
And the al Qaeda that actually attacked us on September 11 , 2001 would not still be out there , had Bush not lost his focus on catching them , and started a war in Iraq , where they had n't previously existed .
And that war in Iraq has been a boon for al Qaeda 's recruiting efforts .
And Bush also failed to stop Abu Musab Zarqawi , in 2002 , before he 'd even had a chance to develop Al Qaeda in Iraq .
So , Bush 's repeated and widespread failures created and exacerbated a disaster he now claims is finally being solved .
Except that he 's lying about that , too .
As the Associated Press reported , just last week :
Al - Qaida is in Iraq to stay .
It 's not a conclusion the White House talks about much when denouncing the shadowy group , known as al - Qaida in Iraq , that used the U.S. invasion five years ago to develop into a major killer .
So , they were n't there before Bush invaded , they are there now , and they 're not going away .
The signficance of that can not be overstated .
And a report in today 's New York Times , about the continuing problems in creating a viable Iraqi Army , included this telling quote :
“ The I.A. is getting mutilated out here , ” said Sgt. James Luce as the Americans prepared to go on a joint mission with the Iraqis .
“ Al Qaeda is better equipped and better trained than they are .
Without us out here , they do n’t stand a chance . ”
The significance of that , too , can not be overstated .
And as for bin Laden , himself ?
Thanks to Bush , he 's still out there .
Still alive .
Still free .
Still threatening the west .
As Agence France - Presse reprted :
Al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden warned Europe Wednesday of a " reckoning " for publishing controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed , US monitoring groups said .
In the message , addressed to the " intelligent ones " in the European Union , bin Laden said that publishing the " insulting drawings " was a greater crime than Western forces targeting Muslim villages and killing women and children .
And the " reckoning for it will be more severe , " he said , according to a transcript of the message provided by the Virginia - based IntelCenter .
More than six years after the September 11 attacks , the significance of that , too , can not be overstated .
The recent decision by Warner Bros. to drop HD DVD support after March of 2008 and throw its lot in with Blu-ray rather obviously threw the HD DVD camp into disarray .
In response to the move , the HD DVD consortium canceled its Sunday night CES presentation , but stated the following in its cancellation notice : " We are currently discussing the potential impact of this announcement with the other HD DVD partner companies and evaluating next steps .
We believe the consumer continues to benefit from HD DVD 's commitment to quality and affordability — a bar that is critical for the mainstream success of any format . "
It 's not clear where Toshiba and the other HD DVD backers plan to go from here .
Multiple companies have invested a great deal of money in making the HD DVD standard a success — the cost of ' persuading '
Paramount to go HD DVD - only is rumored at $ 150 million or more .
Toshiba , in particular , has quite a bit to lose if HD DVD fails , given that it continues to manufacture and sell HD DVD players , and it includes HD DVD drives on some of its high - end laptops .
HD DVD 's long - term future is n't looking particularly bright right now , but that does n't necessarily mean a quick end to the current format war .
If the HD DVD group collectively decides against capitulating to Blu-ray in favor of fighting the good fight , the battle between the two standards could still drag on for several more years .
This type of maneuvering would almost certainly slow overall consumer uptake of HD players , but it would also give Toshiba time to build its own Blu-ray or combo players .
Such a delay could also be useful to Microsoft , as it would give the company time to plan a Blu-ray or combo drive for the Xbox 360 .
From Roll Call …
The National Republican Congressional Committee said Friday that it has contacted the FBI about possible financial improprieties at the committee .
Without providing details , the NRCC released a statement from Chairman Tom Cole ( Okla . ) that said :
“ As part of our ongoing efforts to institute and strengthen financial controls at the National Republican Congressional Committee , we learned earlier this week of irregularities in our financial audit process .
Since these irregularities may include fraud , we have notified the appropriate law enforcement authorities .
We are aggressively and thoroughly investigating the matter and , while we determine the details , we have terminated our relationship with a former employee who was engaged as an outside vendor . ”
Mr. 28 % is now the most unpopular president in Gallup history .
President Bush has set a record he'd presumably prefer to avoid : the highest disapproval rating of any president in the 70 - year history of the Gallup Poll .
In a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday , 28 % of Americans approve of the job Bush is doing ; 69 % disapprove .
The approval rating matches the low point of his presidency , and the disapproval sets a new high for any president since Franklin Roosevelt .
The previous record of 67 % was reached by Harry Truman in January 1952 , when the United States was enmeshed in the Korean War .
The Gulf Stream ’s impact on climate is well known , keeping Iceland and Scotland comfortable in winter compared to the deep - freeze of Labrador at the same latitude .
That cyclones tend to spawn over the Gulf Stream has also been known for some time .
A new study reveals that the Gulf Stream anchors a precipitation band with upward motions and cloud formations that can reach 7 miles high and penetrate the upper troposphere .
The discovery , announced by a Japan–US team of scientists , shows that the Gulf Stream has a pathway by which to directly affect weather and climate patterns over the whole Northern Hemisphere , and perhaps even world wide .
“ Our findings gain even more significance by the fact that the Gulf Stream is the upper limb of the Atlantic portion of the ocean conveyor belt that drives the global ocean circulation , ” says co-author Shang - Ping Xie , a research team leader at the International Pacific Research Center in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology , and professor of meteorology at the University of Hawai ’i at Manoa .
“ The conveyor belt is predicted to slow down with global warming , which implies that changes in the Gulf Stream will modulate spatial patterns of future climate change . ”
Xie has been curious for some time about the response of the atmosphere to warm currents flowing within cold ocean water , such as the Gulf Stream or its Pacific counterpart , the Kuroshio .
Xie says , “ It has been a challenging task to isolate the climatic influence of the Gulf Stream from energetic weather variations by using conventional observations , which are spatially and temporally sporadic .
Our findings were only possible because of the availability of high - resolution satellite data , an operational weather analysis , and an atmospheric circulation model . ”
The first hint that these warm ocean currents have a significant effect on the atmosphere came from high - resolution NASA satellite data .
These images show a narrow rain band hovering frequently over the warm flank of the currents ; wind accelerates and converges over the warm flank and diverges and decelerates on the cold flank .
The satellite images , however , do not allow accurate measurements of upward motions and divergence of air in the upper troposphere , which are necessary to understand the link between the current and large - scale climate .
This is where the European Center for Medium - Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) analysis provided the missing data .
“ It is remarkable to see how the diverging winds 7 miles high show a structure similar to the converging winds and the rain clouds , all meandering with the Gulf Stream , ” says lead author Shoshiro Minobe , a professor at the Division of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Hokkaido University .
The upward wind velocity is strongest about the first mile above the surface , but the Gulf Stream - following structure is clearly visible at 4 miles and still discernible at 7 miles and above .
The band of diverging winds in the upper troposphere follows the meandering Gulf Stream front .
The findings from the operational weather analysis pointed to the warm flank of the Gulf Stream as the cause of the strong upward winds .
“ We wanted more evidence , though , ” says team member Akira Kuwano - Yoshida of the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) , “ and turned to the high - resolution Atmospheric Model for the Earth Simulator ( AGCM ) at JAMSTEC .
We drove the model first with the actual Gulf Stream temperatures .
The model successfully captured the rain band and the signature in the upper troposphere .
Then we removed the sharp sea surface gradient from the Gulf Stream front by smoothing the temperature in the model .
The narrow rain band disappeared . ”
Finally , the team used outgoing longwave radiation satellite data to measure the cloud top temperatures .
The narrow cloud band , associated with lightning , extends 7 miles high above the Gulf Stream meanders and has temperatures below freezing .
All this is further evidence that the Gulf Stream influence on the atmosphere extends far above the lower atmosphere .
The Gulf Stream ’s strength has changed markedly in the past as Earth has switched between warm periods and ice ages .
Closely linked to these changes have been climate changes around the globe — not only in the Atlantic , but also in the Pacific and even in the Southern Hemisphere .
Scientists have been puzzled at how the changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation ( the conveyor belt ) lead to climate anomalies in other regions in the Northern Hemisphere .
The new study discovers a direct pathway , the Gulf Stream ’s deep heating of the atmosphere .
This heating generates planetary waves that can induce quite rapid changes in Earth ’s atmospheric circulation and alter climate over Europe and beyond by riding on the westerly jet stream in the upper troposphere .

Some of the mystery surrounding the Antikythera Mechanism , a mechanical computer recovered from a 2100 - year - old Roman shipwreck near Britain Greece has been unravelled .
The device was an astronomical calculator — and it employed a differential gear !
Using modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning , a team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University peered inside fragments of the crust - encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine .
Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests it dates back to 150 - 100 BC and had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the moon and the sun through the zodiac , predict eclipses and even recreate the irregular orbit of the moon .
The motion , known as the first lunar anomaly , was developed by the astronomer Hipparcus of Rhodes in the 2nd century BC , and he may have been consulted in the machine 's construction , the scientists speculate .
Remarkably , scans showed the device uses a differential gear , which was previously believed to have been invented in the 16th century .
The level of miniaturisation and complexity of its parts is comparable to that of 18th century clocks .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The contamination of Baxter International Inc ’s recalled blood thinner heparin likely was done for economic reasons , the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday .
“ It was apparently , we suspect , done by virtue of economic fraud , ” FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach told a Senate hearing .
Baxter recalled most of its heparin products in February after reports of allergic reactions and deaths .
An FDA investigation later uncovered a heparin - like substance in some batches of the drug ’s active ingredient , which is made in China .
The contaminant was identified last month as a modified form of chondroitin sulfate , a chemical FDA officials have said is likely cheaper to make than real heparin , which is derived from pig intestines .
Speaking to reporters after the hearing , von Eschenbach said the altered chemical would not have occurred during any normal processing .
While the agency has no specific evidence of fraud , “ the concern is that it had to be by design , ” he said .
Von Eschenbach added that the FDA is not investigating the motive , but would leave that to Chinese officials .
Baxter and its ingredient supplier , Scientific Protein Laboratories , have said the contamination occurred earlier in the supply chain before the raw heparin reached either company .
Baxter still is investigating how and why the contaminant was introduced into raw heparin ingredients , company spokeswoman Erin Gardiner said on Tuesday .
“ We know that over - sulfated chondroitin sulfate costs less than heparin .
What we do n’t know is whether or not this was the motivation behind introducing a material that should n’t be in the product , ” she said .
SPL spokesman Wayne Pines said on Tuesday it was “ clear that the raw materials were contaminated and so if there was any economic motivation ... to contaminate it , it occurred before SPL received the materials . ”
In China , raw heparin from pig intestines is often collected from small , mostly unregulated farms .
Some heparin makers have also obtained the ingredient from within the United States and other countries .
Shares of Baxter fell 57 cents , or 0.95 percent , to $ 59.33 on the New York Stock Exchange .
It may seem like a no - brainer to say that foster parents should be well paid .
They are good people doing the hard work of raising someone else 's kids .
Right ?
Fifteen years ago , I was one of those people .
I took good care of the kids who had been placed in my home after being removed from their birth families for various reasons – usually neglect : once because of a severe spanking , another time for " rough handling on the way to the car " when a child was suspended from school .
But I also shopped around for the foster - care agency that paid the best , and I took the harder - to - place kids for the same reason .
I justified my pay by saying it was just like my other profession , nursing .
I enjoyed taking care of patients , and did a good job , but I still expected a paycheck .
It took one particular foster child to show me the big difference between nursing and foster parenting .
I do n't say " I love you " to my patients .
Michael moved in with me at age 9 and at first just enjoyed the benefits of my financial status .
He settled in , began to trust me , and believed me when I said he was a great kid and I was proud to be his mother – if only temporarily .
Kids in foster care need love , acceptance , and affirmation even more than our own kids do .
But try convincing them you were sincere when they find out how much you were paid for your parental love .
Some foster children stay with a family for years , and eventually they are old enough to question where the money for the vacations and the second car came from .
I 'll never forget the look on Michael 's face when he returned from a visit with his mother and asked me , " Did you , like , inherit money or something ?
' Cause my mom works all the time and she only has two pairs of shoes .
You hardly work and you have about 100 . "
I did n't have 100 pairs of shoes , but I was well paid for raising him , while his mother would have paid anything to have the opportunity .
But she had nothing to pay .
She had lost her kids when , at 18 , she called the state for help after her husband deserted her .
She had no family to fall back on , as she was a former foster child herself .
Her poverty cost her the right to raise her own kids .
It seemed wrong to Michael because it was wrong .
Money can put blinders on you , but since I took mine off and adopted my last two foster kids , I can see many reasons why it is wrong to pay foster parents too much :
It creates a disincentive to adopt .
It creates a conflict of interest when a foster parent has to report on how family visits are going .
It makes kids look down on their own families .
It attracts people who do n't even like kids .
Worst of all , it deals a blow to the child 's self - esteem when he learns someone had to be well paid to love him .
I 'm not saying that foster parents should n't be paid at all .
Most are middle - class families who do n't have a lot to begin with .
But how can foster parents say , as some do , " I love him as if he were my own , " if they are not willing to make some sacrifice ?
But if there are n't enough foster parents who will do it for just a little financial help , maybe we should look back to the people who already love the child , without conditions – the birth family .
Yes , there may be cases , such as an abusive parent , in which a child cannot be returned to his or her family .
But in many instances , such as Michael 's , pay the birth family the amount that would be paid to foster parents to help them stay together in the first place .
And if it is still necessary to have a stable of " professional parents , " such as I was , they should be labeled that .
The children should know them from the very beginning – not as foster parents but as paid parents .

RAF quick reaction alert aircraft have been launched on three days this year
RAF fighter jets have been launched at least 21 times to respond to Russian military planes in the last year , the armed forces minister has revealed .
Flights rose after President Vladimir Putin reinstated Cold War - style long range air patrols last August .
In a Commons written answer , Bob Ainsworth said that no Russian aircraft had entered UK airspace , although some had penetrated the Nato policing area .
Quick reaction alert aircraft have been launched on three days this year .
Mr Ainsworth said that British fighter planes - such as the Eurofighter Typhoon - took off to inspect Russian aircraft on 21 days between March 2007 and April 2008 .
The minister was responding to a query from Conservative defence select committee member Bernard Jenkin .
" In the last 12 months no Russian aircraft have penetrated UK national airspace .
However Russian aircraft have approached or entered the Nato air policing area ( APA ) for which the UK has responsibility , " he said .
However , he would not state the exact dates and duration of time that Russian military aircraft had entered the APA because " its disclosure would , or would be likely to , prejudice the capability , effectiveness or security of the armed forces " .
The straight - talking senator was asked about his Hispanic Outreach Director , Dr. Juan Hernandez , at a campaign event in Florida Sunday .
Here ’s video of his reaction .
QUESTION : Senator McCain , I thank you so much for your service … as an Irish … my parents and my grandparents both came here to become immigrants …
I so much want to vote for you , I have one concern … your straight talk … it is you have an outreach – Hispanic outreach person – on your staff , Juan Hernandez , and he has said that he understands why Social Security numbers are stolen … because we do n’t allow the immigrants to get their own , so it ’s ok for him that we steal other Americans ’ Social Security numbers .
He also has written a book called “ The New American Pioneers ” about comparing illegal immigrants , not legal immigrants , to become the “ New Pioneers ” …
I wonder if you agree with his policy ?
If so , explain it to me and if not why is he on your staff ?
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN :
He ’s on my staff because he supports my policies and my proposals and my legislative proposal to secure the borders first .
No one will receive social security benefits who is in this country illegally .
I do n’t know what his previous positions are or other positions are , he supports mine .
I have nothing to do with his .
He has volunteered to help me with outreach to our Hispanic citizenry as I outreach to every citizen in America .
I ’ve been very clear on my position on immigration ; I ’ve been very clear on my position on Social Security .
Of course I am grateful that so many people came from Ireland to the United States of American and anybody else who come here legally and that ’s the only system I will ever support .
I have no idea but I will check in to the information you ’ve given me .
I promise you , I will secure our borders , I will not allow anyone to come here illegally , I will not allow anyone to receive Social Security or any other benefits because they have come here illegally and broken our laws .
Dr. Hernandez is on the record , on his own web site no less , favoring the free flow of people between the United States and Mexico .
The following quote is set off in large red letters on Hernandez ’s web site .
We must not only have a free flow of goods and services , but also start working for a free flow of people .
Hernandez is also on the record advocating a “ Mexico first ” policy for Mexican - Americans who have been living in the US for generations .
The Soros - connected former Mexican cabinet officer is also on the record as seeing the US , Mexico and Canada as a bloc or region within which there should n’t be borders .
Unless those policies sync with McCain ’s , Hernandez does not agree with McCain ’s policies .
He might be on the senator ’s staff for some other reason , but policy agreement is n’t it .
Unless , of course , McCain agrees with Hernandez ’s policies .
And if that ’s the case , the voters ought to know about it .
In the clip , Senator McCain says he does n’t know much about Dr. Hernandez ’s positions .
This should get Senator McCain up to speed .
Update : Michelle received an email from the woman who confronted McCain .

『ウソ』を話しましょ う http://www.kenengba.com/post/409.html
最近のチベット問題に関して、西洋の報道と中国国内の報道ははっきり異なるものでした。
私たちは普段国営の放送局であるCCTV（NHKみたいなもの）を見ているのですが、そのCCTVでは今回の暴動のニュースに関して、放映する映像をのぞいて殆どが偽りのものであったのです。
私たちは、この手には慣れました。
しかし、たいていのユーザー はGreat FireWall*1の存在を、そして国内メディアであるCCTVが情報封鎖をおこなっていることを知っています。西洋諸国メディアが報じることが本当なのです。
このように私が書いたことは、どちらもウソです。
全てウソなのです ！
どうして国内メディアはウソを報じるのでしょう？理由は明確です。政府の意見として、私たちの国の事情として決められたのです。マスコミは政治的な理由で政治問題特にチベット暴動を積極的に報道することができません。
ではなぜ西洋諸国メディアは真実を報道するのでしょう？西洋とはいっても全ての国に当てはまるとは限りませんがね。私たちはまず最初に环球时报*2を見て、その記事から一部を切り取り、西洋諸国のメディアがどのように報道したのか比べてみたいと思います。
CNNに掲載された画像は、暴徒が車に石を投げている右半分が削除されています。（該当記事）
Berliner Morgenpost*3のサイトには武装公安が漢民族を救出となっていますが、本当は暴徒の一人を連れて行くという説明文です。（該当記事）
BBC に載っている記事を見ると写真説明文には "
ラサには多くの軍隊がいる " となっていますが、車体には " 急救" という文字が見えています。（該当記事）
Germany N- TV*4ではネパール警察が抗議者を捕まえる "
チベットで起こった新しい事件" と報道しています。
では、もう一度主題に戻りましょう。" 全てウソです " 。
基本的なことですが、自分のためにウソを言っているのではありません。このような方面を見ると、国内メディアはこの暴動が他の地域で影響が出ないように、国内情勢の安定を維持するために間違った報道をするのだと思えますし、それが本音なのでしょう。
西洋諸国のメディアがウソを報道するのは、彼らにすれば社会主義の上に立つ中国を中国の社会主義の早期死亡を望んでいるからなのです。それと同時に私たちに対する一種の挑発なのです。この考えは間違いありません。
双方のメディアは自分たちが正しいのだと主張しますが、一中国人として、西洋諸国の報道には大変遺憾に思うと同時に残念でなりません。
Great FireWallの存在を知っている人あるいはGreat FireWallをみごと超えた人、そういう人たちは大変誇らしい存在です。他の人たちにGreat FireWallの存在を教え、Great FireWallによって囲い込まれているこのサイトに以下のようなメッセージを送ってくれました。
このような人々の眼に、長く閉ざされていた扉を開き、数多くの情報が流れ込んできて、それらを手にして彼らは自分たちの社会は本当に本当に醜く本当に腐敗していると感じられ、実に悲しく思える。それと同時に外国の社会が本当に良くて、民主的で自由で誠実で活発であると感じた。これらの束縛された情報は信じるに足り、元である情報はウソなのだ。
私の眼にはこのような人たちは " 小白"*5だと見てとれます。私は、どの国も醜い部分やいい部分があって実際に外の世界から見れるのはいい部分なのだと思っています。あなたは家にいるときパンツ一丁で歩き回るように、カクテルパーティに出席するときもそんな恰好でいられますか？あなたは街中を大便を漏らしたまま歩くのでしょうか？
同様に、全ての国が見た目を美しくきれいに着飾っていたとしても、立ち入って調べなければ中にある汚い部分を知ることは難しいのです。
多くの場合、私たちは国の汚れた部分を見ていただけで、外側が綺麗なチャイナドレスで飾ってあったのを見落としていました。
西洋諸国のウソの報道について、一中国人の立場で物申しますと、痛恨の極みであります。ある中国人学生が西洋諸国のメディアに対する反論としてYouTubeに" Tibet WAS , IS , and ALWAYS WILL BE a part of China " というタイトルで以下の動画をアップロードしました。
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9QNKB34cJo *6
西洋諸国の報道に対して反対を表明するのは、私はこのような形でしかできないけども、この記事を見ている人特に西洋諸国の報道が真実だと思う人たちは眼を覚まして反対意見を聞き入れてください。
調和がとれて以来、私は表現することについて多くの疑問を抱きましたが、私はどんなときでも我々の国家の指導者が我々の立場で考えて決めた重要なことを、そしてそれらの多くが正しい決断であったということを信じることにします。

Keith Olbermann 's Special Comment on today 's Countdown was a scathing rebuke of President Bush for continuing to play the fear card , trying to scare the hell out of the American people and vowing to veto any FISA legislation that does not contain telecom amnesty .
You are a liar , Mr. Bush , and after showing some skill at it , you have ceased to even be a very good liar .
And your minions like John Boehner -- your Republican congressional crash dummies who just happen to decide to walk out of Congress when a podium - full of microphones await them -- they should just keep walking , out of Congress and if possible , out of the country .
For they -- and you , sir -- have no place in a government of the people , by the people , for the people .
The lot of you , are the symbolic descendants of the despotic middle managers of some banana republic , to whom " Freedom " is an ironic brand name , a word you reach for , when you want to get away with its opposite .
Thus , Mr. Bush , your panoramic invasion of privacy is dressed up as " protecting America . "
Full transcripts below the fold :
Democrats in the House of Representatives are closing the shop down tonight , until a week from Monday ... leaving President Bush twisting slowly in a wind of his own creation .
Our third story on the Countdown : the FISA bill -- and the retroactive immunity for the telecom giants that helped Mr. Bush illegally eavesdrop on Americans -- will thus just sit there , unacted upon , not even a temporary extension which the Republicans and Mr. Bush refused , despite the President 's threats that if the bill is n't passed by Saturday , there 'd be a breakdown in counter - terrorism surveillance and plagues of locusts and stuff .
A Special Comment , in a moment .
First the details .
House Democrats , in essence , calling the Republicans ' bluff .
They staged a walkout at mid-day ... led by John Boehner , who in one act managed the cheesy political theater , and managed to get out just as Representatives were to vote on Contempt of Congress citations against Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten .
That the Republicans just happened to walk to a stand - full of microphones ... pure coincidence .
The President had started all this , with his now - daily message of fear , with what he apparently sees as a threat , to postpone his scheduled trip to Africa .
The House should not leave Washington without passing the Senate bill .
I am scheduled to leave tomorrow for a long - planned trip to five African nations .
Moments ago , my staff informed the House leadership that I 'm prepared to delay my departure , and stay in Washington with them , if it will help them complete their work on this critical bill .
The lives of countless Americans depend on our ability to monitor terrorist communications .
Having lost , he now says he 's going to Africa -- another threat , or promise , unfulfilled .
Now , as promised , a Special Comment .
A part of what I will say , was said here on January 31st .
Unfortunately it is both sadder and truer now , than it was , then .
" Who 's to blame ? " Mr. Bush also said this afternoon , " Look , these folks in Congress passed a good bill late last summer ...
The problem is , they let the bill expire .
My attitude is : if the bill was good enough then , why not pass the bill again ? "
You know , like The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution .
Or Executive Order 90 - 66 .
Or The Alien and Sedition Acts .
Or Slavery .
Mr. Bush , you say that our ability to track terrorist threats will be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger .
Yet you have weakened that ability !
You have subjected us , your citizens , to that greater danger !
This , Mr. Bush , is simple enough even for you to understand .
For the moment , at least , thanks to some true patriots in the House , and your own stubbornness , you have tabled telecom immunity , and the FISA act .
You .
By your own terms and your definitions -- you have just sided with the terrorists .
You got to have this law or we 're all going to die .
But practically speaking , you vetoed this law .
It is bad enough , sir , that you were demanding an Ex Post Facto law , which could still clear the AT&Ts and the Verizons from responsibility for their systematic , aggressive , and blatant collaboration with your illegal and unjustified spying on Americans under this flimsy guise of looking for any terrorists who are stupid enough to make a collect call or send a mass e-mail .
But when you demanded it again during the State of the Union address , you would n't even confirm that they actually did anything for which they deserved to be cleared .
" The Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America . "
Believed ?
Do n't you know ?
Do n't you even have the guts Dick Cheney showed in admitting they did collaborate with you ?
Does this endless presidency of loopholes and fine print extend even here ?
If you believe in the seamless mutuality of government and big business -- come out and say it !
There is a dictionary definition , one word that describes that toxic blend .
You 're a fascist -- get them to print you a t- shirt with " fascist " on it !
What else is this but fascism ?
Did you see Mark Klein on this newscast last November ?
Mark Klein was the AT&T Whistleblower , the one who explained in the placid , dull terms of your local neighborhood I - T desk , how he personally attached all AT&T circuits -- everything -- carrying every one of your phone calls , every one of your e-mails , every bit of your web browsing into a secure room , room number 641 - A at the Folsom Street facility in San Francisco , where it was all copied so the government could look at it .
Not some of it , not just the international part of it , certainly not just the stuff some spy -- a spy both patriotic and telepathic -- might able to divine had been sent or spoken by -- or to -- a terrorist .
Everything !
Every time you looked at a naked picture .
Every time you bid on eBay .
Every time you phoned in a donation to a Democrat .
" My thought was , " Mr. Klein told us last November , " George Orwell 's 1984 .
And here I am , forced to connect the big brother machine . "
And if there 's one thing we know about Big Brother , Mr. Bush , is that he is -- you are -- a liar .
" This Saturday at midnight , " you said today , " legislation authorizing intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications will expire .
If Congress does not act by that time , our ability to find out who the terrorists are talking to , what they are saying , and what they are planning , will be compromised ... You said that " the lives of countless Americans depend " on you getting your way .
This is crap .
And you sling it , with an audacity and a speed unrivaled even by the greatest political felons of our history .
Richard Clarke -- you might remember him , sir , he was one of the counter - terror pro's you inherited from President Clinton , before you ran the professionals out of government in favor of your unreality - based reality -- Richard Clarke wrote in the Philadelphia Inquirer :
" Let me be clear : Our ability to track and monitor terrorists overseas would not cease should the Protect America Act expire .
If this were true , the president would not threaten to terminate any temporary extension with his veto pen .
All surveillance currently occurring would continue even after legislative provisions lapsed because authorizations issued under the act are in effect up to a full year . "
You are a liar , Mr. Bush , and after showing some skill at it , you have ceased to even be a very good liar .
And your minions like John Boehner -- your Republican congressional crash dummies who just happen to decide to walk out of Congress when a podium - full of microphones await them -- they should just keep walking , out of Congress and if possible , out of the country .
For they -- and you , sir -- have no place in a government of the people , by the people , for the people .
The lot of you , are the symbolic descendants of the despotic middle managers of some banana republic , to whom " Freedom " is an ironic brand name , a word you reach for , when you want to get away with its opposite .
Thus , Mr. Bush , your panoramic invasion of privacy is dressed up as " protecting America . "
Thus , Mr. Bush , your indiscriminate domestic spying becomes the focused monitoring , only of " terrorist communications . "
Thus , Mr. Bush , what you and the telecom giants have done , is n't unlawful , it 's just the kind of perfectly legal , passionately patriotic thing for which you happen to need immunity !
Richard Clarke is on the money , as usual .
That the President was willing to veto this eavesdropping , means there is no threat to the legitimate counter - terror efforts underway .
As Senator Kennedy reminded us in December :
" The President has said that American lives will be sacrificed if Congress does not change FISA .
But he has also said that he will veto any FISA bill that does not grant retroactive immunity .
No immunity , no FISA bill .
So if we take the President at his word , he 's willing to let Americans die to protect the phone companies . "
And that literally cannot be .
Even Mr. Bush could not overtly take a step that actually aids the terrorists .
I am not talking about ethics here .
I am talking about blame .
If the President seems to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater , it means we can safely conclude ... there is no baby .
Because if there were , sir , now that you have vetoed an extension of this eavesdropping , if some terrorist attack were to follow ...
You would not merely be guilty of siding with the terrorists ...
You would not merely be guilty of prioritizing the telecoms over the people ...
You would not merely be guilty of stupidity ...
You would not merely be guilty of treason , sir ...
You would be personally , and eternally , responsible .
And if there is one thing we know about you , Mr. Bush , one thing that you have proved time and time again ... it is that you are never responsible .
As recently ago as 2006 , we spoke words like these with trepidation .
The idea that even the most cynical and untrustworthy of politicians in our history -- George W. Bush -- would use the literal form of terrorism against his own people -- was dangerous territory .
It seemed to tempt fate , to heighten fear .
We will not fear any longer .
We will not fear the international terrorists -- we will thwart them .
We will not fear the recognition of the manipulation of our yearning for safety -- we will call it what it is : terrorism .
We will not fear identifying the vulgar hypocrites in our government -- we will name them .
And we will not fear George W. Bush .
Nor will we fear because George W. Bush wants us to fear .

At first glance , they are the sort of glossy particulars you would find in the window of any estate agent's .
But , on closer inspection , most of the properties on offer ' boast ' some rather unusual features - such as boarded - up windows , possession orders and no front - door entrance .
The homes are being offered by Squatters Estate Agents , which has set up a ' shop ' in a derelict warehouse near the gleaming office buildings of the City of London .
Scroll down for more ...
' Shop ' front :
The estate agent 's premises in Shoreditch , Central London
The new service is advertised on anti-capitalist websites and prospective ' tenants ' are directed to the premises - squatted , of course - in the Shoreditch area of the capital .
A reporter from this newspaper met James , an ' agent ' in his late 20s , wearing jeans , a T - shirt and several days ' stubble , who guided us through the details of dozens of ' available properties ' on printed sheets produced using a digital camera and a computer .
He explained that the service was free and designed to guide others like him into new digs .
Scroll down for more ...
On the agency 's ' books ' are scores of former pubs , abandoned flats and houses , derelict council properties and empty buildings owned by Government departments .
One squat up for grabs is a former JobCentre in East London , owned by the Department for Work and Pensions and described - in perfect estate agentspeak - as a ' huge brick building of mansion - like proportions with two side wings and a covered rear extension ' .
Its proximity to a canal and a Lidl supermarket are highlighted .
But in a piece of advice you would be unlikely to find in most agents ' literature , it adds : " Access looks relatively easy ... round the back . "
Scroll down for more ...
Another hot property is Bedford House , Wheler Street , near the squatters ' office .
Pitched as a " beautiful large building " , it boasts a " red brick , stone and terracotta facade " noted as being " architecturally significant " .
The blurb adds : " It 's a stone 's throw from Liverpool Street and close to trendy Shoreditch and Brick Lane .
It used to be an art gallery but has been empty for quite a while now . "
" According to Land Registry records , the vast Bedford House was bought by a company called Islepark Limited in 2005 .
Its owners could not be contacted .
James said : " There is an enormous amount of unused property in London and other parts of the country .
" The Government keeps talking about the need to build millions of new houses to cope with the housing shortage - but we 're proving they 're wrong .
" They could turn existing empty buildings into new houses instead . "
The ' agents ' - Britain 's first group dedicated to sidestepping the property ladder - are briefed in civil law so they can tell their clients that squatting in England and Wales is , technically , not a crime , so long as the squatters can get into an empty building without damaging it , and are able to secure it .
Quoting from charity the Empty Homes Agency , they claim there are 30,000 vacant dwellings in London alone .
All of the advertised properties carry the warning : " Your home is at risk if you do not keep up your occupancy at all times and replace any existing locks secured on it . "

Squatters Estate Agents are trained in civil law and tell their clients that squatting is technically not a crime , so long as the squatters can get into the building without damaging it , and are able to secure it
Richard West , who owns a former pub in East London being advertised by the squatters , said he was unaware that it faces becoming a squat .
He said : " Thank you for the tip .
I 'll have to secure it .
" Ultimately , though , anyone who wants to squat there can do and there 's little I can do about it until we get planning permission .
" Squatters have more rights than you 'd think . '
ALBANY ( AP )  New York ’s attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , said Thursday that he had issued new subpoenas to Aetna , Cigna , the UnitedHealth Group , WellPoint and other health insurers in a broadening investigation of a practice that he said was unfairly costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars .
He is also looking to subpoena testimony from the chief executives of those companies , as well as from executives of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield , Excellus and the combined Group Health Inc. and HIP Health Plan .
Mr. Cuomo says he believes the companies used a company called Ingenix , which is owned by UnitedHealth , to set payment rates for medical treatments that resulted in consumers being reimbursed at unjustifiably low rates .
Low reimbursements mean higher out - of - pocket costs for consumers when they choose or need doctors outside their health plans .
“ Ingenix is a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry , and the company is determining the rates that the insurance companies use to reimburse consumers , ” Mr. Cuomo said .

Whether you call it the poor man 's dream , a casino without walls , or a tax on the stupid , the lottery has deep and widespread roots .
Here 's a look at five stories about the numbers game .
1. Lotteries of Yore
Lotteries have been around as long as arithmetic .
According to the Bible , God ordered Moses to use a lottery to divvy up land along the River Jordan ( it 's in the Book of Numbers , naturally ) .
And that ai n't all the " good book "  has to say about it : lotteries are also mentioned in Joshua , Leviticus , and Proverbs .
The lottery can also be traced back to China , where a warlord named Cheung Leung came up with a numbers game to persuade citizens to help pay for his army .
Today , it 's known as keno .
Other famous lotteries ?
The Chinese used one to help finance the Great Wall ; Augustus Caesar authorized one to raise money for public works projects in Rome .
And in 1466 , in what is now the Belgian town of Bruges , a lottery was created to help the poor — which lotteries supposedly have been doing ever since .
2. The Founding Fathers Took Their Chances
Displaying the astute politicians ' aversion to direct taxation , early American leaders often turned to lotteries to raise a buck or two .
John Hancock organized several lotteries , including one to rebuild Boston 's Faneuil Hall .
Ben Franklin used them during the Revolutionary War to purchase a cannon for the Continental Army .
George Washington ran a lottery to pay for a road into the wilds of western Virginia .
And Thomas Jefferson wrote of lotteries , " Far from being immoral , they are indispensable to the existence of Man . " 
Of course , when he wrote it , he was trying to convince the Virginia legislature to let him hold a lottery to pay off his debts .
3. Louisiana : A Whole Lotto Love
By the end of the Civil War , lotteries in America had such bad reputations , they were banned in most states .
But not in Louisiana , where a well bribed legislature in 1869 gave an exclusive charter to a private firm called the Louisiana Lottery Company .
The company sold tickets throughout the country , and for 25 years , it raked in millions of dollars while paying out relatively small prizes and contributing chump change to a few New Orleans charities .
Finally , in 1890 , Congress passed a law banning the sale of lottery tickets through the mail , and eventually all multistate lottery sales were banned .
What 's a corrupt U.S. company to do ?
Move offshore , of course !
The Louisiana Lottery moved its operations to Honduras , and America was lottery free until 1963 , when New Hampshire started the lottery cycle anew .
4. " Inaction "  Jackson : Lottery 's Biggest Loser
Clarence Jackson 's luck began to run out on Friday , the 13th of October , 1995 , when the Connecticut Lottery picked the numbers on Jackson 's lotto ticket , making his family the winners of $ 5.8 million .
Only he did n't know it — and he did n't find out until 15 minutes before the one year deadline to claim the prize , despite a whole slew of lottery ads seeking the winner .
Jackson , a 23 - year - old who'd taken over the family 's struggling office cleaning business from his ailing father , did n't make it in time , and lottery officials rejected the claim .
In 1997 , the Connecticut General Assembly voted to award Jackson the prize , but the state senate refused to go along .
Jackson is still trying to convince the legislature .
And still losing .
5 . And Some Other Jackson : Its Biggest " Winner " 
Andrew Jackson " Jack " 
Whittaker was already wealthy when he won the multistate Powerball lottery in December 2002 .
A millionaire contractor from West Virginia , Whittaker became the biggest single lottery winner in history after snagging a $ 314.9 million jack pot .
But the dough seemed to carry more curses than the Hope Diamond .
And when Jack decided to take a $ 170.5 million lump sum instead of payments over 20 years , it was n't the only lump coming his way .
Whittaker was robbed three times , once of more than $ 500,000 at a strip club .
He was also sued for assault , arrested for drunk driving , booked for getting into a bar fight , and even accused of bouncing checks at Atlantic City casinos .
In September 2004 , three burglars broke into his house and found the body of a friend of Whittaker 's granddaughter , whose death may have been drug related .
The following year , the granddaughter was also found dead .
The sad truth ?
Simply that money does n't guarantee peace of mind .
* * * * *
So , have you or anyone you know ever won big in the lottery ?
How'd that work out ?
Ed. Note :
This list was pulled from Forbidden Knowledge .
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour issued a statement calling on the Chinese authorities to allow demonstrators to exercise their right to freedom of expression and assembly .
Ms. Arbour also called on the Chinese Government to “ refrain from any excessive use of force while maintaining order , and to ensure those arrested are not ill - treated and are accorded due process in line with international standards . ”
It has been reported that on 10 March , roughly 60 monks were arrested in Lhasa during a peaceful demonstration .
The following day , Chinese police fired tear gas at some 600 monks who were demanding the release of the arrested monks .
There have been further reports of violence today .
Lately , I ’ve started collecting old VHS tapes about the Internet from the early - to mid-1990s .
While most of these are pretty corny — think Gabe and Max ’s Internet Thing — they also inadvertently captured pieces of the web that do n’t exist anywhere else .
The Internet Archive ’s earliest snapshots were in late 1996 , so anything before that is extremely sparse .
The videos , silly as they are , still represent valuable documentation of the early web .
I spent most of the day yesterday working on a workflow to digitize VHS tapes , settling on VCR to MiniDV camera my Macbook Pro with Firewire .
These tapes are pretty worn , so the quality ’s not great , but that almost adds to their charm .
Here ’s the result : the first volume of a two - tape collection called “ Internet Power ! ” from 1995 .
I ’ve included some select quotes and screenshots below .
Internet Power – Discover the World of Online Entertainment ( 00:36 )
“ The explosive growth in the number of people who have discovered the power of the Internet for learning , marketing and just plain having fun has been incredible .
The Internet is changing the way we learn , work , and play forever .
Today , some 35 to 40 million people from around the world are linked together through the Internet , the world ’s largest computer network .
Students of all ages are discovering the online power of the Internet as the ultimate tool for learning .
Whether you ’re in grade school or college or beyond , or you just want to be entertained and have a good time , the Internet has something for everyone . ”
I love the Windows 3.1 references , and that they used 8 - Ball Pool for Windows to demonstrate the power of the Internet .
“ But before we go too far , let ’s take a moment and have a look at just what the Internet is and what it takes to start surfing through Cyberspace .
You may already be a net surfer and you may want to skip this section , but if you ’re just starting out , we suggest you spend a few minutes getting familiar with some of the most common Internet terms . ”
Dig that mid-1990s design aesthetic .
Grey background , huge 3D rendered header graphic , Times New Roman italic , centered text …
It ’s 1995 , all right .
“ You ’ll need a device to access the online world .
That device is a Computer , with at least 386 power and 8 megabytes of RAM and has a modem installed that has 14.4 or greater speed or ‘ baud rate . ’
And of course , access to a phone line .
If you have a slower modem , you will not be able to enjoy the growing multimedia aspects of the Internet , such as graphics , sound , and video . ”
“ You will also need a connection to the Internet that connects your computer to the millions of other computers that make up this Superhighway of Information . ”
A number of vintage ISPs and screenshots are included , followed by an interview with a Microsoft tech named Bret Arsenault .
Bret ’s the only person interviewed in the video , as the resident expert .
“ Any of the online services , such as America Online , will provide you with a connection to the Internet , along with a navigation tool called a Browser which enables you to move from location to location anywhere in the world . ”
The browser pictured is AIR Mosaic , provided with Spry ’s Internet in a Box .
“ Parents concerned about unwanted content may want to sign up with a major online service where you can be assured that their own content is filtered , and then have your child advise you when they ’re going directly onto the World Wide Web and provide parental supervision as required .
There are software packages in development that will assist parents in locking out unwanted Internet content in the future . ”
“ The Internet has been around since the 1960s , but it was the development of the Mosaic browser in 1933 at the University of Illinois that made it possible to simply point and click your way to information that not only contained text , but also graphics .
Now the average person can enjoy the full potential of the Internet , and especially , the fastest - growing part of the Internet called the World Wide Web . ”
Yes , he said 1933 .
Apparently , the launch of Mosaic ushered in the Great Depression .
Some nice shots of the original Smithsonian site , and a basic explanation of the Web by Arsenault and the narrator .
How did you describe the Web in 1995 ?
“ A Web site is like a book that is divided into chapters .
By clicking on the hypertext links , you choose which pages you want to view in the book .
A Home Page is like the first page of the book , with a Table of Contents and general introduction into what is contained in the site . ”
Next comes a brief introduction to domain names , FTP , Usenet , Gopher , and email , before launching into the next section : Search Engines .
“ When it comes to fun and entertainment , the power of the Internet is unlimited ! ”
Search Engines ( 08:04 )
“ To get started , we have to sift through the vast amounts of information on the Internet and find what we need .
The best way to do this is by using one of the many Search Engines available .
These sites gather the information that is out there and categorize it so we can narrow our search .
One popular site to do this is called Yahoo ! ”
The list of search engines on the slide is a great flashback .
“ Web Crawler , Lycos , Einet , WWW Worm , Yahoo , Info Seek , Savvy Search … and More ”
“ Normally , these sites would take a few seconds to load to your computer , but in the interest of time , we ’re cutting to them through editing for the purposes of this video . ”
Later , they cover a long - lost site called “ The Weatherman , ” where you email your trip profile and a nice guy named George Gatto emails you a weather forecast by hand .
I ca n’t imagine that ’d scale very well .
Gopher ( 12:04 )
“ Gophers can be a one - stop source for finding information on the Internet .
This particular site has many categories to choose from .
Let ’s keep our same subject , weather , to see how this differs from our Yahoo! search . ”
Shopping ( 13:20 )
“ The Internet has thousands of sites for shopping and many of them are grouped together in large Internet Malls …
Let ’s try a different search engine this time .
We ’ll use another popular one called Webcrawler . ”
“ Let ’s choose one … The Mega Internet Shopping List sounds promising ! ”
I could go on all night .
Later , they cover Online Games ( 16:36 ) and Online Entertainment ( 20:42 ) , but the Online Magazines section ( 25:35 ) is my favorite , with screengrabs of Hotwired , Nintendo Power , and the craziest sitemap ever from a very early Time.com .
“ You ’ve got a lot of exploring to do , so surf wisely and have a great time ! ”

Fun with VHS
Now that I ’ve nailed the workflow , I ’m going to be digitizing more of my collection .
If you have any other classic Internet goodness locked up on VHS , get in touch .
I ’ll happily put it online for you .
2019 . 31 years after being destroyed during World War 3 , Tokyo ( now ' Neo - Tokyo ' ) has been rebuilt and is a thriving metropolis .
Shotaro Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang .
His friend Tetsuo is injured in an accident and taken to a top - secret government facility .
He develops telekinetic powers but decides to use them for evil rather than good .
He has the same powers as Akira , the force that destroyed Tokyo in 1988 , and now it appears that history will repeat itself .
Written by grantss
I suppose it ’s time to tell my story .
I was a Smalltalk zealot in the late 90’s , but I left it behind when I started my own business .
I ’ve now come full - circle , and I ’m finding once again that Smalltalk is the best tool for most of the programming work I do .
I learned Smalltalk programming from Travis Griggs while working at Key Technology .
He mentored me in Smalltalk and other general programming methods , and I introduced him to Linux .
Travis likes to give me more credit than I deserve for some of the work that we did together , but one thing was certain : we had a blast working together .
Key went through a difficult aquisition , and I spent most of my energy working to bring our two software teams to common ground .
My wife and I travelled back and forth between Medford , Oregon and our home in Walla Walla ( with our newborn son , our first ) while I worked with developers in both locations .
Diplomacy is not something I particularly enjoy , but I ’m good at it and the team really needed somebody in that role .
But the end result was that I did n’t get much time to do any significant programming .
The more time passed , the more I missed it .
I did n’t get to work with Travis as much anymore , and our team was becoming fractured as our project list grew .
Despite all of my efforts to bring people together , our team was dissolving under the increasing project load .
I had always wanted to work from home , and I was becoming burned out in my Key position , so I left Key and took up consulting work .
Most of my clients needed web applications , so I became a web developer .
I built my first web applications in Smalltalk .
Travis and I had written the original WikiWorks code , and I used our experience there to build my own HTTP 1.1 server .
This later became the basis for the Swazoo server , which was built on my code at Camp Smalltalk 2000 in San Diego .
I implemented my own Smalltalk Active Pages ( abbreviated SAP , to distinguish them from ASP sites ) and built several sites using them .
At the time , there was n’t much web application work being done in the Smalltalk world , and the frameworks people were developing were unattractive to me .
I had to support myself , from top to bottom , and this was starting to feel painful .
This was what drew me towards PHP , Apache , and PostgreSQL .
The promise of safety in numbers was attractive — I would never have to wonder if my server was fully compliant with the HTTP specs .
But the main attraction for me was PHP ’s support for for various open source libraries .
PHP made it easy to handle image uploads in multiple formats , draw custom graphs , and build other visuals on the fly .
Editing PHP apps in vim was easier over low - bandwidth connections ( like a cell phone data connection ) than making a VNC connection to a headful server image , too .
So I left Smalltalk behind and built a few large PHP apps .
Nearly all of them relied heavily on PHP ’s graphics library bindings for generation of custom reports and editable page components .
I built content management systems that let my customers edit their page titles , for example , and behind the scenes PHP would generate new navigation buttons from template PNGs and TrueType fonts .
Another app managed a database of donors for a non -profit radio network and allowed call - center volunteers to easily enter pledges from supporters — while the studio crew saw up - to - the - minute totals on their screens .
Things went smoothly at first but got rougher as the applications got bigger .
I made heavy use of the flimsy object model in PHP 4 and built my own object - relational layer , and this helped me survive as long as I did .
But I grew increasingly frustrated as I tried to scale my PHP applications .
There was no way around the ugliness of the code .
At that time , somebody pointed me at one of the early versions of Seaside .
I had taken a look at Seaside a few years ago , and while it looked interesting , I confess that I did n’t get it .
I saw how call : and answer : worked to give you a certain level of modalism in your application , but that was all I saw .
The Seaside HTML writers were less mature then , too , and that was a deterrent to me .
I liked being able to interleave PHP and HTML code in template files , but that was mostly because my pages did n’t use CSS effectively .
I missed the larger picture , so I went back to PHP .
When Ruby on Rails started to gain popularity , it was like a breath of fresh air to me .
Rails is a very clean framework for web applications , and it required no paradigm shift .
Much of the work I had done in PHP already followed some of the Rails patterns , but now I had a full - fledged object - oriented language at my disposal again .
I thought I had finally found the best of both worlds — a thriving community , lots of support for graphics formats , easy database connectivity , and a nice clean dynamic language .
These days , that would sound like the end of the story .
But it ’s not .
The truth is , I ’m disappointed with Ruby .
Rails is “ classic web development done very cleanly ” , as Ramon Leon says .
And Ruby is my favorite non-Smalltalk language .
But it ’s not Smalltalk .
In fact , I ’ve come to see that Ruby missed the mark on several points .
File - based source control .
In a Smalltalk image , all of the classes and code libraries your application needs are available to you immediately .
Tools like the Refactoring Browser are much harder , if not impossible , in Ruby .
Reflection .
Ruby ’s reflection is OK , but it ’s much weaker than the reflection in Smalltalk .
If more of the Ruby base code was itself written in Ruby , and Ruby allowed better reflection , a Ruby code browser would undoubtedly be easier to write ( and more powerful once written ) .
Speed .
The Ruby interpreter is slow .
In Rails , I still end up writing more complicated database queries than I should have to , because the Ruby interpreter is so slow to process data in memory .
No Keyword Messages : Travis and I ran some tests using keyword - style messaging using Ruby ’s last - argument - collapsed - as - hash , and the performance was terrible .
Blocks .
Ruby simply missed the mark on on these .
All blocks should be first - class objects , not just a layer of syntax .
Live Interaction .
Irb is good , but Smalltalk workspaces are much better .
Debugger .
The Ruby debugger feels like gdb compared to Smalltalk .
Most of the time , people opt to debug using console output and interactive exploration using Irb .
It ’s better than printf , but not much .
Class Library :
The Ruby class library is much younger than the extensive class library in Squeak or VisualWorks .
As far as Rails is concerned , I have far fewer criticisms .
But once you ’ve looked at Seaside , and you really understand the approach Seaside is taking , Rails just looks old .
I never want to marshal data through a URL again if I can help it .
I ’ve also come to see that unless you ’re a light user of a technology , you have to be able to support yourself .
This is not a downside for Smalltalk , it ’s a reality of the complex environment we work in .
Smalltalk ’s web and graphics tools have come a long way lately , but ultimately Smalltalk empowers you to support yourself in a way that Ruby just does n’t .
I have been digging in the Ruby 1.8 source tree more often than most , and it ’s not nearly as easy to navigate as the Smalltalk base .
Remember , most of the Smalltalk base is implemented in Smalltalk .
Seaside is certainly more advanced than Rails in terms of raw technology , to the point that it ’s hard to wrap your head around the concepts .
It took me two attempts , and I ’m fairly young and intimately familiar with Smalltalk .
Rails is smoother — it gives a better out - of - the - box experience in the short term .
But for larger web apps , you need to be thinking further than that .
Do n’t be surprised if Seaside just looks weird to you at first .
Leave it for a little while and then come back .
You ’ll be glad you did .
And when it clicks for you , beware .
You wo n’t ever look back .

Cassini Spacecraft Finds Ocean May Exist Beneath Titan's Crust
NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has discovered evidence that points to the existence of an underground ocean of water and ammonia on Saturn 's moon Titan .
The findings made using radar measurements of Titan 's rotation will appear in the March 21 issue of the journal Science .
" With its organic dunes , lakes , channels and mountains , Titan has one of the most varied , active and Earth - like surfaces in the solar system , " said Ralph Lorenz , lead author of the paper and Cassini radar scientist at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL ) in Laurel , Md. " Now we see changes in the way Titan rotates , giving us a window into Titan 's interior beneath the surface . "
Members of the mission 's science team used Cassini's Synthetic Aperture Radar to collect imaging data during 19 separate passes over Titan between October 2005 and May 2007 .
The radar can see through Titan 's dense , methane - rich atmospheric haze , detailing never - before - seen surface features and establishing their locations on the moon 's surface .
Using data from the radar 's early observations , the scientists and radar engineers established the locations of 50 unique landmarks on Titan 's surface .
They then searched for these same lakes , canyons and mountains in the reams of data returned by Cassini in its later flybys of Titan .
They found prominent surface features had shifted from their expected positions by up to 19 miles .
A systematic displacement of surface features would be difficult to explain unless the moon 's icy crust was decoupled from its core by an internal ocean , making it easier for the crust to move .
" We believe that about 62 miles beneath the ice and organic - rich surface is an internal ocean of liquid water mixed with ammonia , " said Bryan Stiles of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in , Pasadena , Calif .
Stiles also is a contributing author to the paper .
The study of Titan is a major goal of the Cassini - Huygens mission because it may preserve , in deep - freeze , many of the chemical compounds that preceded life on Earth .
Titan is the only moon in the solar system that possesses a dense atmosphere .
The moon 's atmosphere is 1.5 times denser than Earth's .
Titan is the largest of Saturn 's moons , bigger than the planet Mercury .
" The combination of an organic - rich environment and liquid water is very appealing to astrobiologists , " said APL 's Lorenz .
" Further study of Titan 's rotation will let us understand the watery interior better , and because the spin of the crust and the winds in the atmosphere are linked , we might see seasonal variation in the spin in the next few years . "
Cassini scientists will not have long to wait before another go at Titan .
On March 25 , just prior to its closest approach at an altitude of 620 miles , Cassini will employ its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer to examine Titan 's upper atmosphere .
Immediately after closest approach , the spacecraft 's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer will capture high - resolution images of Titan 's southeast quadrant .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The mission is managed by JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
The Cassini orbiter also was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .

The Mahdi Army 's seven - month - long cease - fire appears to have come undone .
Rockets fired from the capital 's Shiite district of Sadr City slammed into the Green Zone Tuesday , the second time in three days , and firefights erupted around Baghdad pitting government and US forces against the militia allied to the influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
At the same time , the oil - export city of Basra became a battleground Tuesday as Iraqi forces , backed by US air power , launched a major crackdown on the Mahdi Army elements .
British and US forces were guarding the border with Iran to intercept incoming weapons or fighters , according to a senior security official in Basra .
The US blames the latest attacks on rogue Mahdi Army elements tied to Iran , but analysts say the spike in fighting with Shiite militants potentially opens a second front in the war when the American military is still doing battle with the Sunni extremists of Al Qaeda in Iraq .
" The cease - fire is over ; we have been told to fight the Americans , " said one Mahdi Army militiaman , who was reached by telephone in Sadr City .
This same man , when interviewed in January , had stated that he was abiding by the cease - fire and that he was keeping busy running his cellular phone store .
Sadr City residents say they saw fighting Tuesday between Mahdi militiamen and US and Iraqi forces in several parts of the district .
One eyewitness , in the adjacent neighborhood of Baghdad Jadida , who wished to remain anonymous , said he saw a heavy militia presence on the streets , with two fighters planting roadside bombs on a main thoroughfare .
Lt. Col. Steve Stover of the Baghdad - based 4th Infantry Division said that in the span of 12 hours Tuesday 16 rockets were fired at the Green Zone and nine rockets and 18 mortar rounds fell on US bases and combat outposts on the east side of Baghdad .
A mortar round hit a US patrol in the northern Adhamiyah district , killing one US soldier .
A roadside bomb set a US Humvee on fire in Sadr City but all soldiers inside survived .
He said clashes broke out between American forces and militiamen when they attacked several government checkpoints in the district and that some of these posts are now manned by both US and Iraqi forces .
Almost exactly four years ago , American forces and Mr. Sadr 's loyalists clashed on the streets of Baghdad 's Sadr City and the holy city of Najaf shortly after the US shuttered his newspaper for allegedly inciting violence .
That round of fighting lasted several months and at one point the Americans were aiming to arrest Sadr , a cleric whose religious credentials come from his father who was widely influential and loved .
The fighting burnished Sadr 's standing among fellow Shiites wary of the US occupation .
Over the years , the US has repeatedly accused elements within the Sadrist movement of having ties with Iran and even Lebanon 's Hizbullah .
After rockets hit the Green Zone Sunday , US commander in Iraq Gen. David Petraeus said the weapons had been provided by Iran .
On Tuesday , Rear Adm .
Greg Smith , spokesman for US - led multinational forces in Iraq , blamed the elite Quds units of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards for supplying the 22 107 - mm and 122 - mm rockets that hit the heavily fortified area of Baghdad that is home to the US Embassy .
" We believe the violence is being instigated by members of special groups that are beholden to the Iranian Quds Force and not Sadr ....
Although we are concerned , we know that very few Iraqis want a return to the violence they experienced before the surge , " he says .
Admiral Smith says US and Iraqi forces were facing two distinct enemies in Al Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) and the Iranian - trained and supplied special groups .
But he adds , " AQI is still Iraq 's No. 1 enemy . "
There is growing concern , however , that Iran could respond to such US accusations .
" This is pretty serious , and if the Iranians do not back down rapidly this will escalate , " says Martin Navias , an analyst at Britain 's Centre for Defence Studies at King 's College in London .
" The US has a number of problems with Iran , mainly the nuclear program and its behavior in Iraq .
There are many people in the Bush administration who want to hit Iran . "
While Iraqi troops fought with Shiite militants in Basra Tuesday , a contingent of Coalition troops , including British and US forces , mobilized at Basra 's border with Iran to prevent militiamen from escaping or smuggling in ammunition and weapons , according to a senior security source in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of his remarks .
The US military refused to comment on this , citing " security reasons " during ongoing operations , while another spokesman , Col. Bill Buckner , said the Basra operation was Iraqi-led and that the US was providing " limited assistance " mainly in " intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance , and ... support aircraft . "
The US military has regularly accused Iran of smuggling weapons into Iraq over this border , particularly armor- piercing bombs known as explosively formed penetrators ( EFP ) that have been blamed for the deaths of many US soldiers in Iraq .
" This is a major operation aimed at outlaws and removing all heavy weapons and explosives from the hands of militias inside the city .
It has now escalated into fighting between the Iraqi Army and the Mahdi Army because they are resisting , " the security official said by phone from Basra , a few hours after the start of the offensive dubbed " The Knights ' Assault . "
The Basra - based official said that fighting is now centered in Mahdi Army strongholds in the neighborhoods of Tamimiyah , Hayaniyah , and Five Miles , and that there was also fighting in the neighboring provinces of Nasiriyah and Maysan .
A curfew has also been imposed in Nasiriyah and other southern cities , such as Samawa and Kut , the scene of clashes involving the Mahdi Army over the past two weeks .
One Basra resident reached by phone said he was holed up at his office at the local branch of the ministry of trade , and described the sound of explosions and gunfire as " terrifying . "
Two Iraqi Army battalions and five battalions of the National Police 's quick - reaction force were dispatched to Basra , where an entire Army division is already stationed .
" The lawlessness is going on under religious or political cover along with oil , weapons , and drug smuggling .
These outlaws found support from inside government institutions either willingly or by coercion ... turning Basra into a place where no citizen can feel secure for his life and property , " said Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in a statement read on state television , which reported that Mr. Maliki along with the ministers of defense and interior were all in Basra to oversee the operation .
The reaction from Sadr 's camp was swift .
At a press conference in the holy city of Najaf , three of the cleric 's top lieutenants condemned the government offensive and accused Maliki , a Shiite , of carrying out a US agenda .
They also threatened a nationwide campaign of protests and civil disobedience if US and Iraqi forces continued to fight the Mahdi Army .
Smith , the military spokesman , said the US would not stop this campaign if it remained peaceful .
One of the movement 's leaders , Liwa Smaisim , described as " preposterous " US claims that it was only targeting splinter elements of the Mahdi Army .
Hazem al - Aaraji , another leader usually based in Baghdad , said the current fighting was a continuation of a campaign by the movement 's Shiite rivals in the Iraqi government to finish it off – a drive it began last fall in southern Iraq .
Sadr 's influence was felt throughout Baghdad Tuesday , highlighting the risk that the fight in Basra may spread to the capital , home to a large segment of his supporters .
On Tuesday , witnesses reported that gun battles broke out in the capital 's Sadr City district between the militia and rivals from the Badr Organization , which is part of Maliki 's ruling Shiite coalition .
The offices of one of the branches of Maliki ’s Dawa Party was torched in Sadr City , according to the US military .
On Monday evening , pickup trucks filled with chanting Mahdi militiamen , within sight of Iraqi forces , were forcing shopkeepers in many parts of Baghdad 's west side to close in protest of US and Iraq Army raids .
On Tuesday , all shops in the Mahdi Army stronghold neighborhoods – Bayiaa , Iskan , Shuala , and Washash – were shuttered .
Leaflets saying " No , no to America " were plastered on each storefront .
Anti-American banners hung right next to Iraqi government checkpoints .
Several people interviewed in the Amel neighborhood said they were forced by militiamen to return home when they tried to go to work this morning .
" This is anarchy , " says Ali al - Yasseri .
• Awadh al - Taiee in Baghdad and a Najaf - based Iraqi journalist contributed reporting .
Editors note :
This story is part of a Feature " The Color of Plants on Other Worlds " from the April 2008 issue of Scientific American .
Photosynthesis evolved early in Earth ’s history .
The rapidity of its emergence suggests it was no fluke and could arise on other worlds , too .
As organisms released gases that changed the very lighting conditions on which they depended , they had to evolve new colors .
4.6 billion years ago -- Formation of Earth
3.4 billion years ago -- First photosynthetic bacteria
They absorbed near - infrared rather than visible light and produced sulfur or sulfate compounds rather than oxygen .
Their pigments ( possibly bacteriochloro­phylls ) were predecessors to chlorophyll .
2.4–2.3 billion years ago --
First rock evidence of atmospheric oxygen
2.7 billion years ago -- Cyanobacteria
These ubiquitous bacteria were the first oxygen producers .
They absorb visible light using a mix of pigments : phyco­bilins , carotenoids and several forms of chlorophyll .
1.2 billion years ago -- Red and brown algae
These organisms have more complex cellular structures than bacteria do .
Like cyanobacteria , they contain phycobilin pigments as well as various forms of chlorophyll .
0.75 billion years ago -- Green algae
Green algae do better than red and brown algae in the strong light of shallow water .
They make do without phyco­bilins .
0.475 billion years ago -- First land plants
Mosses and liverworts descended from green algae .
Lacking vascular structure ( stems and roots ) to pull water from the soil , they are unable to grow tall .
0.423 billion years ago -- Vascular plants
These are literally garden - variety plants , such as ferns , grasses , trees and cacti .
They are able to grow tall canopies to capture more light .
The media here seem more shocked than I am .
But imagine — a country dedicated to liberal economics ( more or less ) nationalizes one of the largest firms in its most vibrant economic sector .
Martin
Wolf has a good piece on the event .
The real question is whether the UK ( and other countries ) will feel compelled to move to a system of regularized depositor liquidity rights and larger deposit insurance guarantees .
Right now British depositors receive a lower guarantee , both de jure and de facto , and can wait for months for access to their funds from a failed bank ; read more here .
For all its drawbacks and screwy incentives , arguably the biggest advantage to deposit insurance is simply that it makes bank nationalizations unlikely .
Simply letting the bank fail is not always a credible alternative , because of contagion effects , bank runs , and the simple workings of democracy .
The bank did face an offer from Richard Branson but it seems that the numbers did not add up and the government would have been left holding the bag anyway .
Felix Salmon adds commentary .
Jülich scientists have made an important step on the long road to artificially mimicking photosynthesis .
They were able to synthesise a stable inorganic metal oxide cluster , which enables the fast and effective oxidation of water to oxygen .
Artificial photosynthesis may decisively contribute to solving energy and climate problems , if researchers find a way to efficiently produce hydrogen with the aid of solar energy .
Hydrogen is regarded as the energy carrier of the future .
The automobile industry , for example , is working hard to introduce fuel cell technology starting in approximately 2010 .
However , a fuel cell drive system can only be really environmentally friendly , if researchers succeed in producing hydrogen from renewable sources .
Artificial photosynthesis , i.e. the splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen with the aid of sunlight , could be an elegant way of solving this problem .
However , the road to success is littered with obstacles .
One of the obstacles to be overcome is the formation of aggressive substances in the process of water oxidation .
Plants solve this problem by constantly repairing and replacing their green catalysts .
A technical imitation depends on more stable catalysts as developed and synthesised for the first time by a team from Research Centre Jülich , member of the Helmholtz Association , and from Emory University in Atlanta , USA .
The new inorganic metal oxide cluster with a core consisting of four ions of the rare transition metal ruthenium catalyses the fast and effective oxidation of water to oxygen while remaining stable itself .
" Our water - soluble tetraruthenium complex displays its effects in aqueous solution already at ambient temperature , " enthuses Prof .
Paul Kögerler from the Jülich Institute of Solid State Research , who synthesised and characterised the promising cluster together with his colleague Dr. Bogdan Botar .
Catalytic measurements were carried out at Emory University .
" In contrast to all other molecular catalysts for water oxidation , our catalyst does not contain any organic components .
This is why it is so stable " .
Botar explains the next step : " Now the challenge is to integrate this ruthenium complex into photoactive systems , which efficiently convert solar energy into chemical energy " .
So far , energy is still obtained from a chemical oxidant .

BASEL ( Reuters ) - Luxury watchmakers are well positioned to escape a possible slowdown in consumer spending as they target wealthy customers who are increasingly willing to splash out on extravagant and unique watches .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Swiss watchmaker Romain Jerome ’s “ Day & Night ” watch -- which does not tell the time , only whether it is night or day -- sold out within 48 hours of its launch earlier this year as watch fanatics snapped up the $ 300,000 timepiece .
“ When you ask people what is the ultimate luxury , 80 percent answer ‘ time ’ .
Then when you look at other studies , 67 percent do n’t look at their watch to tell what time it is , ” Chief Executive Yvan Arpa told Reuters on Friday at Baselworld , the watch and jewellery industry ’s largest annual trade fair .
“ Why do people buy expensive watches ?
To have a trophy .
A watch ( costing ) $ 9 gives the time as well as a watch at $ 500,000 , so they really buy a trophy , ” Arpa said .
The “ Day & Night ” watch uses the complicated Tourbillon movement -- invented to overcome earth ’s gravity which used to affect the accuracy of watches -- which lures watch connoisseurs as well as fashion aficionados .
The Geneva - based company , founded in 2004 , also has an order backlog of up to two - and - a - half years for its “ Titanic DNA ” watch , which is made from steel and coal from the Titanic and can cost as much as $ 500,000 .
“ If you do something that is different , which is interesting , it pays , ” Arpa said .
NEW MARKETS BOOM
Luxury watchmakers are also banking on buoyant demand from emerging markets , such as Asia and the Middle East to offset a slowdown in the United States .
“ The first quarter of the year has been very good -- following the same trend as last year and last year was a record year for the watch industry and for the major luxury companies in general , ” Philippe Mougenot , president of Chanel ’s fine jewellery and watches division , told Reuters .
“ Now we are a bit on the look out to see what consumption will be ( like ) within the next months in the States ...
There is a lot of psychologically negative talk through the press and this may have some impact , ” Mougenot said .
“ But the big difference now ( compared ) with 10 years ago is that we have new markets that were not existing at that time , ” he said .
Chanel has seen its high - end watch and jewellery products selling “ astonishingly well ” .
One its most pricey pieces is the “ J12 18 place Vendome ” watch , costing 550,000 euros ( $ 864,100 ) .
And the head of Swiss watchmaker La Montre Hermes , part of French luxury group Hermes International , has also seen strong sales .
“ During a crisis , people have another level of consciousness .
It does n’t mean that they will not buy , it is just that they are looking more carefully at what they buy , ” La Montre Hermes CEO Emmanuel Raffner told Reuters .
A RENEGADE British spy has told the inquest into the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , that she could have been murdered by MI6 officers using a strobe gun to blind her driver .
Richard Tomlinson said he realised his former colleagues at the Secret Intelligence Service might have been responsible when he saw a documentary alleging that there had been a bright flash before the princess 's car crashed in a Paris underpass .
He remembered an MI6 training session in which he was shown a portable strobe light intended temporarily to blind targets in vehicles .
Mr Tomlinson said he had also seen an MI6 document in 1992 detailing a plan to murder the Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic by flashing a strobe light at his chauffeur as he entered a tunnel in Geneva .
It bore an " alarming and very eerie similarity " to the crash that killed the princess , he said .

Large - scale biofuel production may increase marginalization of women
New study on biofuel production focuses on gender 21 April 2008 , Rome – Rapid increases in the large - scale production of liquid biofuels in developing countries could exacerbate the marginalization of women in rural areas threatening their livelihoods , according to a new FAO study .
The study notes that large - scale plantations for the production of liquid biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel require an intensive use of resources and inputs to which small farmers , particularly women , traditionally have limited access .
These resources include land and water , chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
“ Unless policies are adopted in developing countries to strengthen the participation of small farmers , especially women in biofuel production by increasing their access to land , capital and technology - gender inequalities are likely to become more marked and women ’s vulnerability to hunger and poverty further exacerbated , ” said Yianna Lambrou , co-author of the paper entitled Gender and Equity Issues in Liquid Biofuels Production – Minimizing the Risks to Maximize the Opportunities .
“ Biofuel production certainly offers opportunities for farmers – but they will only trickle down to the farm level , especially to women , if pro-poor policies are put in place that also empower women . ”
The pressure from biofuel production
The growing global demand for liquid biofuels , combined with increased land requirements , could put pressure on so - called “ marginal ” lands , which provide key subsistence functions to the rural poor and are frequently farmed by women , the report noted .
The conversion of these lands to plantations for biofuels production “ might cause the partial or total displacement of women ’s agricultural activities towards increasingly marginal lands , ” with negative consequences for women ’s ability to provide food , according to the report .
The potential depletion or degradation of natural resources associated with large - scale plantations for biofuel production may place an additional burden on rural farmers ’ work and health , in particular on female farmers .
If biofuel production competes , either directly or indirectly , for water and firewood supplies , it could make such resources less readily available for household use .
This would force women , who are traditionally responsible , in most developing countries , for collecting water and firewood , to travel longer distances thus reducing the time available to earn income from other sources .
The report also warned that the replacement of local crops with monoculture energy crop plantations could threaten agro- biodiversity as well as the extensive knowledge and the traditional skills of smallholder farmers in the management , selection and storage of local crops , all activities performed mainly by women .
Unequal employment opportunities
The establishment of plantations for biofuel production may create new employment opportunities in rural areas .
These opportunities are targeted mainly to low - skilled agricultural workers , who are increasingly employed on a seasonal or casual basis .
A growing number of these workers are women ( around 40 percent of the total in Latin America and the Caribbean ) , who due to existing social inequalities tend to be particularly disadvantaged , compared to men , in terms of wages , working conditions and benefits , training and exposure to safety and health risks .
The report stresses the need for further research and data on the socio-economic effects of liquid biofuel production on men and women .
The study calls for an environmentally sustainable and pro-poor biofuel development strategy , integrating energy crop plantations into existing local agri-food systems in order to protect smallholder farmers ’ traditional agricultural activities , skills and specialized knowledge , which are crucial to the food security and long - term resilience of rural communities .
Measures should be taken to ensure that women and female - headed households have the same opportunity as men to engage in and benefit from the sustainable production of liquid biofuels .
This is all the more important as the number of households headed by women is growing , with around 40 percent of the total in Southern Africa and 35 percent in the Caribbean .

India has not allowed large - scale public protests
More than 100 refugees were detained in India while attempting to march to the Chinese border last week .
They were marching as part of the global pro-independence protest .
India has in the past been sympathetic to the Tibetan cause but in recent years Delhi 's relations with Beijing have improved .
India has not allowed large - scale public protests for fear of embarrassing Beijing .
" The Tibetan issue is a very sensitive one in our relations with India , " Mr Wen was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
" We appreciate the position and the steps taken by the Indian government in handling Tibetan independence activities masterminded by the Dalai clique . "
On Friday , the marchers , who were protesting against China hosting the Olympics , were detained near Dharamsala town , headquarters of the Tibetan government - in - exile , and placed in custody for 14 days .
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said he hoped the troubles would be solved through dialogue and non-violent means .
" We are distressed by reports of the unsettled situation and violence in Lhasa and by the deaths of innocent people , " Mr Mukherjee told parliament during a debate on Tibet on Monday .
His remarks were criticised by some opposition parties , who described them as an " inadequate response " .
Mr Mukherjee reiterated that India 's policy of non-interference in China was still the same despite recent events .
Sticker shock at the pump is getting worse , the federal government said Monday as gasoline prices set record highs in California and across much of the nation .
The average price U.S. drivers paid for regular self - serve gasoline climbed to a new high of $ 3.389 a gallon after rising 5.7 cents over the last week , the Energy Department said .
The national average is up 51.3 cents in the last year because of high crude oil costs .
The commodity closed Monday at a record $ 111.76 a barrel , up $ 1.62 .
In California , motorists paid an average of $ 3.774 a gallon , a record and the highest price in the weekly survey of more than 800 service stations nationwide .
The state average was 8.9 cents higher than that of the previous Monday and 46.9 cents higher than the level a year earlier .

The price of crude oil accounts for about 70 % of the cost of making gasoline .
The Energy Department recently predicted gas prices could average as much as $ 3.60 a gallon this summer and said the daily national average could rise as high as $ 4 at times .
Prices are already over $ 4 in some parts of the country .
But a growing number of analysts do n’t believe the national average will rise that high unless unanticipated events occur .
“ I do n’t think so , unless there is some sort of outage or refinery event , ” said Fred Rozell , retail pricing director at the Oil Price Information Service .

Barring such an event , prices could fall back to $ 3 a gallon , or lower , by late summer , said Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates , an energy consultancy in Galena , Ill .
“ Take your vacation late this year , ” said Ritterbusch , who believes prices will dip in July or August .
Still , unexpected refinery outages have forced price spikes in the past .
Last spring , a string of outages drove prices to record levels in May .
Then they mostly fell until late in the year , when they began to track crude oil higher .
Prices normally rise in the spring as suppliers stock up in advance of the summer driving season and refiners switch over from making winter grade gasoline to the more expensive , but less polluting , summer version of the fuel .
As they perform this switch , refiners try to sell all their winter fuel , driving overall supplies down .

“ I think prices will top out in late June and July , ” said Tony Kolton , chief executive of Logical Information Machines , a Chicago - based analytics and data provider .
“ We are entering the strongest season for crude oil right now as refiners prepare for the driving season . ”
In the Energy Department ’s latest survey , San Francisco was the city with the highest prices at $ 3.818 a gallon , up 9.5 cents .
The Gulf Coast states had the cheapest regional price at $ 3.285 a gallon , up 3.2 cents .
Boston had the lowest city price , up 5 cents to $ 3.18 .
The average price for diesel fuel soared 10.4 cents to a record $ 4.059 a gallon , up $ 1.18 from a year earlier , the agency said .
Average diesel fuel prices were reported at $ 4 a gallon or higher in every region of the country .
California ’s average diesel price was $ 4.234 a gallon .
THAT is the message the Democratic presidential candidates appear to have heard and adopted ( as I believe we 've mentioned here once or twice this week ) .
It is a bad idea , to say the least .
Not only because of the economic benefits of greater economic integration , but for geopolitical reasons as well .
In the wake of Democratic statements on the trade deal , government leaders from Canada and Mexico expressed their deep displeasure at the rhetoric , and at the possibility that an American president would go back on his country 's word and ignore the concerns of valuable trading partners , just to secure a few votes .
After the finger - wagging from America 's northern and southern neighbours , Daniel Drezner wrote :
Democrats cannot simultaneously talk about improving America 's standing abroad while acting like a belligerent unilateralist when it comes to trade policy .
At the
American Prospect
, Jordan Michael Smith had

If the U.S. pulls out of NAFTA , it 's not at all clear it will be easy to renegotiate it with better labor and environmental standards , because Canada , to say nothing of Mexico , has its own set of concerns when it comes to trade .
For instance , Canadians are furious about the softwood lumber dispute ( I had to spend an entire month on it in grad school ) , and are just itching to clobber some Yankees over it .
As Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said ( warned ? ) yesterday , " If any American government chose to make the mistake of reopening that we would have some things we would want to talk about as well . "
And as Federal Trade Minister David Emerson said Wednesday , " Knowledgeable observers would have to take note of the fact that we are the largest supplier of energy to the U.S. and NAFTA has been the foundation for integrating the North American energy market . "
to say :
The world is globalised , and an election in America does not make one 's neighbours disappear , much as one might wish them to .
Mr Drezner is correct to note that re-establishing respect for America 's allies is a key plank of the Democratic electoral platform .
It is awfully hard to square that with efforts to throw those allies ' economic concerns out the window .
But perhaps we could avoid this discussion altogether .
All the attention paid to a single tri-lateral trade agreement should remind us that trade agreements are a pretty subpar way to liberalise trade in the first place .
That 's the point made by Richard Baldwin at VoxEU today , who calls the tangle of overlapping and conflicting bi-lateral and regional trade agreements " the spaghetti bowl . "
This tangle of trade deals is a bad way to organise world trade .
The discrimination inherent in regionalism is already economically inefficient but its costs are rising rapidly as manufacturing becomes ever more internationalised .
Stages of manufacturing that used to be performed in a single nation are now often geographically unbundled in an effort to boost efficiency .
Supply chains spread across many borders .
Unbundling , which accelerated since the 1990s , is the most important new element in the regionalism debate .
It is the reason why business is pushing so many nations to ‘ tame the tangle .’...
While the spaghetti bowl is a problem for firms in big nations , it is much more so for firms in poor nations .
Rich nations have the resources and negotiating leverage to navigate the tangle ’s worse effects .
The governments of small and poor nations do not .
The spaghetti bowl falls much harder on the heads of the world ’s small and poor nations .
Economists often point out that trade can increase subsequent to a trade negotiation due to trade creation or trade diversion .
Trade creation involves a wealth increasing redistribution of resources to low - cost producers .
Trade diversion means that an alteration in trade barriers has artifically advantaged a higher cost producer within the agreement over a lower cost producer outside the agreement .
Trade volume within the trade area increases , but overall efficiency is reduced .
Efficient allocation of resources , and the wealth that results , is one of the primary benefits of world trade .
Liberalising via many tiny agreements distorts this process , and pits trading nations and trading blocs against each other .
It also distracts from important goals , like the strengthening of healthy institutions worldwide , or the tackling of global environmental problems .
If the Democratic presidential candidates are seriously interested in an agenda of hope , they should focus on improving the lives of Americans through the cultivation of global prosperity .
An excellent way to begin that process would be to throw American leadership behind efforts to liberalise trade and develop appropriate standards at a global level .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 13 — Federal agents investigating the Sept. 16 episode in which Blackwater security personnel shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians have found that at least 14 of the shootings were unjustified and violated deadly - force rules in effect for security contractors in Iraq , according to civilian and military officials briefed on the case .
The F.B.I. investigation into the shootings in Baghdad is still under way , but the findings , which indicate that the company ’s employees recklessly used lethal force , are already under review by the Justice Department .
Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek indictments , and some officials have expressed pessimism that adequate criminal laws exist to enable them to charge any Blackwater employee with criminal wrongdoing .
Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to discuss the matter .
The case could be one of the first thorny issues to be decided by Michael B. Mukasey , who was sworn in as attorney general last week .
He may be faced with a decision to turn down a prosecution on legal grounds at a time when a furor has erupted in Congress about the administration ’s failure to hold security contractors accountable for their misdeeds .

About 14 million , or roughly 18 % , of the USA 's 79 million baby boomers can expect to develop Alzheimer 's or some other form of dementia in their lifetime , a newly released report shows .
Americans are developing Alzheimer 's at an accelerating rate , says Stephen McConnell , vice president of public policy for the Alzheimer 's Association .
Medical advances have allowed people to beat cancer and heart disease .
But with longer life comes the added risk of Alzheimer 's , a progressive brain disease that causes severe memory loss and confusion .
The oldest baby boomers are turning 62 this year and are by definition entering the risk zone .
Age is the single biggest risk factor for the disease :
The likelihood of developing Alzheimer 's doubles every five years after age 65 .
" What we 're faced with here is the boomer population coming of age , " says Gary Small , director of the UCLA Center on Aging .
" There are going to be a lot more people at risk . "
The report , " 2008 Alzheimer 's Disease Facts and Figures , " states that one out of eight boomers will be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's , the most common type of dementia , at some point .
If no cure for Alzheimer 's is found , the nation will be faced with a half - million new cases of Alzheimer 's in 2010 and nearly a million a year by the middle of the century .
The report does n't minimize the burden on the population today , noting that 5.2 million people now have the disease , which can take more than 10 years to destroy the mind .
That figure includes a small group of people struggling with the disease in the prime of life .
The report says as many as 500,000 Americans are diagnosed before the age of 65 .
According to the Alzheimer 's Association , 70 % of people with Alzheimer 's and other dementias live at home , where friends and family members pitch in to help them , often at great cost .
The report notes :
• In 2007 , nearly 10 million Americans ages 18 and older provided 8.4 billion hours of unpaid care to Alzheimer 's patients — care valued at about $ 89 billion .
• A quarter of a million children ages 8 to 18 are providing care to loved ones with Alzheimer's .
The care provided by young people ranges from companionship to more taxing duties such as helping an elderly relative get dressed , McConnell says .
• There are up to 1.4 million long - distance caregivers in the USA .
About 1 million live more than two hours away , and an additional 400,000 live at least an hour away from their loved ones .
The coming Alzheimer 's epidemic will , if left unchecked , put a huge strain on the health care system , including Medicare .
In 2005 , Medicare spent $ 91 billion on Alzheimer 's and other dementias , and spending could jump to $ 160 billion by 2010 and $ 189 billion by 2015 .
If researchers developed treatments that simply delayed the age of onset for Alzheimer 's , that alone could save Medicare billions .
" We do n't need to cure this disease , " McConnell says .
" If we could just make a dent in it , the savings would be huge . "

To millions of teenage Asian girls he 's Gok Pak - wing , the Canto - pop crooner who sets hearts fluttering as he sings in fluent Cantonese .
But away from the spotlight , he 's plain old Barry Cox , a former supermarket shelf - stacker from Liverpool whose incredible journey to China began with a visit to his local takeaway .
Barry , 30 , said : " Two or three doors away from my home was a chip shop run by a Chinese family .
" I wanted to learn how to speak the language and I thought ' I need to find a way to get in there ' .
So I went and bought a pie . "
Scroll down for more ...
Barry Cox :
The 30 - year - old from Liverpool has become a singing sensation in China after learning the language in his local takeaway
From there , Barry asked the owner if he would teach him his native language .
" So he started teaching me Cantonese , " explains Barry .
" And I taught his nephew English . "
Barry was soon spending four hours a night in the chip shop learning new words and phrases .
And after leaving school at 16 with five GCSEs , Barry spent years learning the nine tonal variations of Cantonese - the dialect of Hong Kong and south China - generally recognised as far more difficult than Mandarin , the national language spoken in Beijing and the north .
He became a regular in the Liverpool Chinese community 's favourite bars and karaoke lounges , and took a job as a shelf - stacker in a Chinese supermarket to practise his language skills .
" I 'd grown up watching films , but I never imagined I 'd be able to learn the language , " says Barry .
" I was doing a lot of dead - end jobs - supermarkets , insurance companies that sort of thing - and I thought ' What could I do to improve myself ? ' "
As his fluency developed , Barry further immersed himself in Chinese culture and went to see one of Hong Kong 's favourite entertainers , and was so inspired he entered a local singing competition at Chinese New Year .
" I sang terribly but everyone applauded , I guess because it was so out there , " he laughs .
After that , he had singing lessons , and travelled to China in search of fame and fortune .
He began entering - and winning - karaoke competitions , beating native Chinese speakers .
Now he has been given star billing , currently singing at the Venetian hotel , the new mega- casino in the Chinese gambling haven of Macau .
In the next few months , he will release his first single - a duet with Ayi Jihu , a singer dubbed the Chinese Madonna - and an album .
After that he plans to tour Singapore .
But life on the other side of the world is n't with out its drawbacks .
" I miss my friends and family , " admits Barry .
" And there are days I 'd do anything for a cake from Sayer 's .
Or a pastie .
" If I ever moved back I 'd eat a million of them and put on loads of weight , so it 's probably a good job . "
Barry also longs to see his beloved Liverpool FC at Anfield .
" I never miss a match , " he says .
" Even if it means getting up at 3 am I see every game on TV . "
Aside from supporting the Reds , Barry spends night after night singing his favourite songs in immaculate Cantonese , occasionally slipping in a Mandarin or English phrase .
And it's this cross-cultural emphasis that has inspired Hollywood film directors to make a film of his life story .
Initial interest came from Miramax , the US film company .
The idea was also pitched to director of a Hong Kong - based firm .
But the project has now been taken up by Atman Entertainment and the producer of Fight Club - who are hoping to pull together to start filming in Liverpool next year .
" They say they want to make the film because what I 've done has brought the two communities together , " says Barry .
" But to me it does n't seem all that remarkable .
It just seems like my life , a series of things I 've done . "
Barry is also in talks to put his name to a fashion line - called Barry .
" Hong Kong clothing label Styleultra have asked me to help design a range of clothing - casual but stylish sportswear , " says Barry .
" I 'm hoping to make it unisex , and hopefully it'll bring in Chinese and English influences .
It 's a new challenge for me , something I 've never done before , so I 'm looking forward to it . "
Barry seems settled in his life in China , so much so that he can't imagine moving back to Liverpool .
" I 've fallen in love with Asia , " he says .
" I walk out in the morning and I 'm in the middle of Hong Kong or one of the other big Chinese cities .
It 's very cosmopolitan , you can walk down the street and see people from all over the world .
" Then I go out of the city and I 'm in these tiny villages .
It 's just beautiful .
I 'll come back to Liverpool for visits to see friends and family , but here it feels like home . "
DIGG THIS
Last year , Virginia Tech University successfully lobbied the state legislature to prohibit concealed - permit holders from carrying a sidearm on campus .
At the time , university spokesman Larry Hincker commented ,
Im sure the university community is appreciative of the General Assemblys actions because this will help parents , students , faculty , and visitors feel safe on our campus .
In June of last year , the university reemphasized its ban on carrying guns on campus by students , employees , and visitors .
Last spring , it disciplined a student with a concealed - carry permit who brought his handgun to class .
On April 16 , 2007 , 43 students and faculty members paid the price for such shortsightedness when a deranged student killed 33 and wounded the remainder with handguns .
Despite claims to the contrary , this is not the worst school killing in U.S. history .
On May 18 , 1927 , a disgruntled school - board member killed 45 people and injured 58  most of them second - grade to sixth - grade children  when he set off bombs at Bath Consolidated School in Bath , Michigan .
In response to the Virginia Tech incident , gun-control advocates predictably demanded more gun-control laws .
Carolyn McCarthy ( D - N.Y. ) , author of the latest assault - weapon ban making its way through Congress , which is a more draconian version of the Clinton 1994 assault - gun ban that expired in 2004 , suggested that we need to talk about guns on campus .
For once , I agree with Representative McCarthy .
The gunman , Cho Seung - Hui , a Korean national with permanent resident status , had filled out the required forms and undergone the mandatory background check and waiting period , proving once again the uselessness of such laws .
The problem at Virginia Tech was not that there were guns on campus  only the campus police and gunman were armed  but that it was a  gun - free zone . 
As a result , there were not enough people carrying guns to neutralize the gunman once he began his rampage .
He should have been outgunned after his first shots .
To a criminal or deranged person bent on killing , a gun - free zone is a free - fire zone .
As is obvious from all such incidents , the police arrive too late to prevent multiple killings .
That s not to disparage the police .
In most cases , they act aggressively and competently .
But they are rarely the first to arrive at the scene of a crime .
The first ones there are the perpetrators and their victims .
Thats when self - defense weapons are needed , not after the damage is done .
Consider that in all such incidents , the shooters are not so deranged as to attack police stations , shooting ranges , or gun shows .
They have enough presence of mind to assail unarmed people in gun- free zones because they will encounter no effective resistance .
( The one incident in which an individual was foolish enough to threaten to kill hostages where guns were prevalent was at a shooting club in California in July 1999 .
The gunman was promptly shot by an employee , without harm to the hostages . )
Test my hypothesis .
Was anyone carrying a gun killed or injured in the Virginia Tech shooting ?
Only one , the perpetrator by his own hand .
All the other victims were unarmed .
They were unarmed because of state law , university policy , the success of gun-control advocates , and a false sense of security .
The gun-control lobby has succeeded in stigmatizing gun possession and training ; influencing legislators to pass laws making it difficult for law - abiding people to purchase , carry , and use firearms ; and convincing people that they can depend on the police to protect them .
The students are also at fault for believing the lie that they are not responsible for their own protection in the face of common sense and history .
Handguns and self - defense
Handguns are self - defense tools .
They are designed to protect people from those who would harm them .
In many cases , merely the appearance of a firearm dissuades an attacker .
When you prevent people from carrying self - defense weapons , you are making them easy targets .
Lets look at some examples to illustrate my point :
In 1974 , 34 Israeli students were gunned down in a bus on a school trip .
Israel responded by arming teachers , administrators , bus drivers , and others to protect their children .
Israel has not had a repeat of that tragedy .
The U.S. governments response ?
Prohibit guns within 1,000 feet of schools , as if criminals and deranged people obey laws .
In October 1997 , Assistant Principal Joel Myrick used a gun to stop a violent teen who was shooting up his high school in Pearl , Mississippi .
The student killed two and wounded seven before Myrick could stop him .
Why did it take Myrick so long to disarm the shooter ?
His gun was in his automobile , which was parked more than 1,000 feet from the school in compliance with the law .
In January 2002 , a disgruntled student at the Appalachian School of Law in Grundy , Virginia , shot and killed the dean , a professor , and a fellow student .
He was disarmed and subdued before he could harm anyone else by two students who retrieved guns from their automobiles .
Utah and Oregon allow concealed - permit holders to carry their weapons on campus .
To date , no school shooting incidents have occurred in these states .
The most heavily armed populations are the Swiss and the Israelis .
Crime is negligible in both countries .
The Luby Cafeteria shootings in Killeen , Texas , on October , 16 , 1991 , where a gunman killed 23 people , provide a stark example of the danger of gun-control laws .
Suzanna Gratia Hupp , who was having lunch with her parents , left her gun in her car in compliance with state law .
Her parents were among those killed .
Two other diners also left their guns in their cars for fear of violating state law .
Hupp had a clear shot at the killer several times as he reloaded and leisurely executed patrons .
 I was mad as hell at my legislators ,  she said , because they had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family . 
Hupp is responsible for Texass having enacted a concealed - carry law in 1995 .
How many more victims must be sacrificed on the altar of gun control ?
How many more Virginia
Tech incidents must occur before common sense prevails ?
Blaming inanimate objects for criminal acts and legislating barriers to self - defense is foolish and self - destructive .
The hostile atmosphere to gun possession and training fostered by gun-control advocates is costing lives .
Frustration , pain , and other emotions shouldnt drive legislation ; reason should .
Though we may not be able to prevent such incidents , we can limit the damage they do .
Instead of listening to gun-control advocates whose advice brings death and injury , we would do better to abide by the Boy Scout motto :
Be prepared !

Health benefits : A tomato can help keep skin looking youthful , according to a new study
At this rate , scientists will have to come up with a better description for the tomato than mere ' superfood ' .
While it has long been credited with cutting cholesterol and preventing some cancers , the fruit now appears to have two more healthgiving benefits .
Protection against sunburn and helping keep the skin looking youthful are the latest pluses , a study has found .
Professor Mark Birch - Machin said tomatoes could provide a cheap and easy way of improving health .
" I went into the study as a sceptic , " he added .
" But I was quite surprised with the significance of the findings . "
Researchers at Manchester and Newcastle universities recommend two tomato - based meals a day for optimum health .
Possible menus include a glass of tomato juice with breakfast and a salad later or tomato soup for lunch and pasta with a tomato sauce for dinner .
To test the fruit 's ability to protect the skin , ten volunteers were asked to eat five tablespoons of tomato paste mixed with olive oil every day for three months .
Another ten had a daily dose of olive oil - minus the tomato paste .
Tests using ultra-violet lamps showed the tomato - eaters were a third better protected against sunburn at the end of the study than at the start , the British Society for Investigative Dermatology 's annual conference heard .
Other tests suggested the tomato - based diet had boosted production of collagen , the protein that keeps skin supple .
If that were not enough , the fruit also protects our mitochondria - the elements of cells which turn the food we eat into energy .
Professor Birch - Machin , of Newcastle University , said : " Being kind to our mitochondria is likely to contribute to improved skin health , which in turn may have an anti-ageing effect . "
The researchers stressed , however , that their findings were not an excuse to throw away the suncream .
Professor Lesley Rhodes , a Manchester University dermatologist , said : " People should not think tomatoes in any way can replace suncreams but they may be a good additive .
" If you can improve your protection through your diet then over several years this may have a significant effect . "
She added : " These were n't huge amounts we were feeding the group .
It was the sort of quantity you could easily manage by eating a lot of tomato - based meals . "
The fruit 's benefits are credited to lycopene , the pigment behind its distinctive red skin .
Lycopene , a powerful antioxidant capable of mopping up free radicals - the harmful molecules linked to cancer - is made easier for the body to absorb when tomatoes are cooked or processed .
Come on military , naming operations should n't be complicated .
If you can't do it yourself , hire the guy who named Metallica tours in the ' 80s .
We'd bet the troops would feel pretty close to indestructible riding into battle as a part of " Operation Ride the Lighting . "
Instead they 're asked to rally behind these monuments to self - parody .
These are all real names of military operations .
And besides the few times we specify otherwise , they 're brought to you courtesy of our very own American military .
USA !

How bad is the economy ?
In the May issue of Harpers Magazine , Kevin Phillips cuts through the numbers in an article entitled “ Numbers Racket :
Why the economy is worse than we know . ”
The revelations Phillips makes are shocking .
The U.S. government has been consciously cooking the books for decades .
How do you make inflation look lower than it is ?
Just remove some items from consideration and create value out of thin air ( e.g. , “ product substitution , ” “ geometric weighting ” and “ hedonic adjustments ” ) .
Truly , you ’ve GOT to read the details to believe what has been going on .
If you think that inflation is running between 2 % – 4 % , think again .
Using honest accounting methods , it ’s more like 12 % .
If CPI had been honestly reported for the past couple of decades , Social Security checks would be 70 % greater than they currently are .
We have an official unemployment rate of 5 % .
The government arrives at that nice low number by simply not counting all of the people who want jobs .
If you really counted those people , the U.S. has an employment rate of about 9 % .
Who profits from these fake number of low inflation and low unemployment ?
Might it be Washington politicos and affluent elites , anxious to mislead voters , coddle the financial markets , and tamp down expensive cost - of - living increases for wages and pensions ?
Do n’t forget the utterly ridiculous concept of “ imputed income , ” one of several forms of phantom income , which constitutes 15 % of GDP .
Phillips see nothing but trouble resulting from the use of these methods of cooking the national books .
An honest accounting “ would reveal a nation in deep difficulty not just domestically but globally . ”
The undermeasuring of inflation is especially insidious :
[ I]t hangs over out heads like a guillotine .
To acknowledge it would send interest rates climbing , and thereby would endanger the viability of the massive buildup of public and private debt ( from less than $ 11 trillion in 1987 to $ 49 trillion last year ) that props up the American economy . . .
The U.S. dollar , off more than 40 percent against the euro since 2002 , could slip down an even rockier slope .
Israel using Facebook to distribute terrorist instructions and incite hate
' Let 's make our own rockets '
A new Facebook group is urging Sderot residents to use the Internet to learn how to build crude rockets , much like the Kassams launched at them from the Gaza Strip , and fire them back at the Palestinians .
The group , which currently has 45 members [ in fact over 100 members and rising at a steady rate later on 11 Feb thanks to media publicity ] , posts material from the Internet on how to manufacture rockets .
[ In the US , UK or any other allied country this would be clearly illegal .
If Muslims in any country did something like this on any web site , the mass media and the west - dominated " international community " would immediately condemn them as " terrorists " .
( There are numerous examples of allegations and trials of this nature against Muslims , often involving questionable interpretations , alleged " coded " messages , etc . )
The material would already have been removed from Facebook , the accounts of those responsible would already be closed , and arrest warrants would be issued for the perpetrators .
Yet in Israel people can do this freely and openly , with at least tacit support from the state and sections of the media -- as long as they are n't Muslims , the official enemy .
The reasons for these double - standards are worthy of deeper investigation , and the reader is encouraged to undertake further research in this area . ]
Facebook , a social networking site that has taken the on - line world by storm , allows anyone to create groups and to invite people to join .
The group 's creators , Shai and Batya Messenberg from Petah Tikva , posted a description that reads : " It can not be so difficult : If those retards from the Gaza Strip can do it then so can you . "
[ The Facebook group has members from other countries including the US and UK where it is clearly illegal .
For example , the group 's main public page features a message from a clearly identified male Jewish youth living in Britain who expresses strong support for the group -- a clear and serious criminal act under UK anti-terrorism law , carrying a long prison term , Membership is growing fast thanks to exposure in the media and links from major web sites including the Jerusalem Post newspaper .
High - profile supporters stop short of openly supporting the group , but promote it with web links and coverage and make no attempt to criticise the group . ]
The description encourages residents of the town to trawl the Net for information on how to build ballistic missiles from materials found in the home .
" I 'm sure that very soon they [ the Gazans ] will get the message , " the group 's creator wrote .
A link to NASA 's Rocket Science 101 tutorial can also be found on the Facebook group 's page .
The tutorial allows users to choose from a menu of rockets to assemble , although the NASA rockets are much larger and more complex than the Kassam .
The message goes on to say that Sderot residents can also do their part in cutting off the flow of Israeli electricity to the Gaza Strip , " even if the High Court of Justice wo n't allow it , " by finding someone with a tractor who is willing to drive into nearby electrical poles .
The Gaza Strip receives 70 percent of its electricity from Israel , the vast majority of which is produced at the Rotenberg Power station in Ashkelon .
The group 's logo picture shows a Palestinian Kassam rocket crew preparing to fire , with the words " This could be you " scrawled in red across the photograph .
The new group joins about 50 other Facebook groups in support of Sderot , such as Save Sderot , Stop the Kassam rockets in Sderot , Light a candle with Sderot , I stand w/ Sderot , From 90210 to Sderot , Children of Sderot , Skate for Sderot , and For the residents of other towns in the western Negev not waiting for the next Kassam ( this group is planning to ask every radio station in the country to simultaneously play the Color Red alarm - the one heard in Sderot when Kassam rockets are fired from Gaza - to increase awareness of Sderot 's plight ) .
Last month , a WIMAX wireless Internet infrastructure was established in Sderot .
The technology enables the use of wireless broadband links over long distances .
The project will allow students and others to surf the Web for free and with high - quality connections .

� Judge 's directions to jury were deficient [ deceptive if we dispense with unnecessary diplomacy and waffle ] , says court
� Islamist material 'is legal unless linked to violence '
Five young Muslim men yesterday had their terrorism convictions quashed after judges concluded that reading Islamist material was not illegal unless there was " direct " proof it was to be used to inspire violent extremism .
The men had been jailed in July 2006 with the trial judge saying they had been " intoxicated " by extremism ...
...
" While they lent support to the prosecution case that the appellants had formed a plan to go to Pakistan to train and then to Afghanistan to fight , there was nothing that evidenced expressly the use , or intention to use , the extremist literature to incite each other to do this . "
[ This is in stark contrast with the Israeli Facebook group , which manifestly is a serious criminal offence under Section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , clearly stating the intent to use the weapons .
All members of the Facebook group are eligible to be arrested tried in a court of law under the Act , with those members who posted messages of endorsement , invited others to join or distributed the link in any way , along with the founders of the group , attracting the longest prison sentences . ]

Asif Siddique was held at the high security Govan police station in Glasgow following the operation in Alva , Clackmannanshire .
His brother Atif Siddique was charged under the Terrorism Act on Thursday , following his detention on 13 April .
Two other men also arrested on Monday were earlier released without charge .
...
Central Scotland Police declined to comment beyond confirming that there were now insufficient grounds to detain Asif Siddique .
On Thursday , Mr Siddique 's brother , Atif Siddique , 20 , was charged with offences under Section 58 ( 1b ) of the Terrorism Act at a specially convened court in Falkirk .
The offences relate to the possession of documents or records containing information " likely to be useful " to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism .

FACEBOOK'S POLITICAL INFLUENCES

Israel 's 84 - year - old president has a novel idea on how to battle anti-Semitism : Facebook .
Shimon Peres told a group of international students on Tuesday at Israel 's Holocaust memorial that the popular social networking site was an effective means to counter the spread of hate and incitement on the Internet .
[ The meaning of the term " anti-Semitism " in this context is " enemies of Israel " .
This is a distortion of the actual meaning : anti = against , semitic = pertaining to the descencdents of Abraham ( including Arabs / Muslims ) .
In many countries the general public are conditioned with the assumption that the term " Semitic " is exclusive to Jews , a false and narrow interpretation .
However , the word " Semitic " has not yet lost its true meaning among academics , e.g. the " Semitic languages " in linguistics which include Ababic . ]

ToorCon
In a first for a major company , Microsoft has publicly pledged not to sue or press charges against ethical hackers who responsibly find security flaws in its online services .
The promise , extended Saturday at the ToorCon security conference in Seattle , is a bold and significant move .
While researchers are generally free to attack legally acquired software running on their own hardware , they can face severe penalties for probing websites that run on servers belonging to others .
In some cases , organizations have pursued legal action against researchers who did nothing more than discover and responsibly report serious online vulnerabilities .
" This is actually really important because online services - that 's our stuff , " Microsoft security strategist Katie Moussouris told several hundred researchers .
" The philosophy here is if someone is being nice enough to point out your fly is down , they 're really doing you a favor and you should thank them rather than calling the cops and saying you 're a pervert . "
Moussouris said she is pushing to get a provision added to a proposed standard that 's making its way through the International Organization for Standardization that would protect ethical hackers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in other companies ' websites .
" If I get my way , it 'll be in there , " she said .
( In a brief exchange after her talk , Moussouris told us she did n't know offhand exactly how the proposed standard was designated .
We 're guessing it's this one , though we can't be sure . )
The idea is to make websites safer by taking advantage of the legions of independent researchers who stumble upon security bugs .
As she put it : " Do n't hate the finder , hate the vulnerability .
We do n't actually want to discourage people who are trying to help us by being iffy about whether we 're going to go after them . "
As things stand , researchers frequently turn a blind eye to gaping security holes on websites for fear of suffering a fate similar to that of Eric McCarty .
The prospective student at the University of Southern California found a flaw in the school 's online application system that gave him access to other applicants ' records .
In 2006 , he was charged with computer intrusion after producing proof of his finding .
" There 's definitely a lot of trepidation among legitimate researchers to find flaws in public - facing web applications because you never know how [ companies ] are going to react , " said Alex Stamos , a founding partner at iSEC Partners , a firm that provides penetration - testing services .
" That hurts us because the only people finding these flaws are the bad guys . "
Moussouris 's remarks came as she gave a progress report on Microsoft 's efforts to be more responsive to security researchers .
One new initiative is a two - day course called Defend the Flag , a modified version of Capture the Flag , for its IT employees who are new to security .
Microsoft is also offering assistance to companies grappling with their own security issues and giving a heads - up when it learns of vulnerabilities affecting third - party vendors .
Microsoft 's security team has also worked hard to strike a balance between releasing security patches quickly and making sure the updates do n't break products that customers rely on .
" We are a huge target , obviously , " Moussouris said .
" Some of you love that about us .
We basically face a lot of issues that a lot of vendors have n't had to deal with .
Not many vendors out there can break the [ internet ] if they mess up their patches . " ®

Chemists are describing development of a “ revolutionary ” process for converting plant sugars into hydrogen , which could be used to cheaply and efficiently power vehicles equipped with hydrogen fuel cells without producing any pollutants .
The process involves combining plant sugars , water , and a cocktail of powerful enzymes to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide under mild reaction conditions .
They say it is the world ’s most efficient method for producing hydrogen .
The new system helps solve the three major technical barriers to the so - called “ hydrogen economy , ” researchers said .
Those roadblocks involve how to produce low - cost sustainable hydrogen , how to store hydrogen , and how to distribute it efficiently , the researchers say .
“ This is revolutionary work , ” says lead researcher Y.- H. Percival Zhang , Ph.D. , a biochemical engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg , Va .
“ This has opened up a whole new direction in hydrogen research .
With technology improvement , sugar - powered vehicles could come true eventually . ”
While recognized a clean , sustainable alternative to fossil fuels , hydrogen production is expensive and inefficient .
Most traditional commercial production methods rely on fossil fuels , such as natural gas , while innovations like microbial fuel cells still yield low levels of hydrogen .
Researchers worldwide thus are urgently looking for better way to produce the gas from renewable resources .
Zhang and colleagues believe they have found the most promising hydrogen - producing system to date from plant biomass .
The researchers also believe they can produce hydrogen from cellulose , which has a similar chemical formula to starch but is far more difficult to break down .
In laboratory studies , the scientists collected 13 different , well - known enzymes and combined them with water and starches .
Inside a specially designed reactor and under mild conditions ( approximately 86 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the resulting broth reacted to produce only carbon dioxide and hydrogen with no leftover pollutants .
The method , called “ in vitro synthetic biology , ” produced three times more hydrogen than the theoretical yield of anaerobic fermentation methods .
However , the amount of hydrogen produced was still too low for commercial use and the speed of the reactions is n’t optimal , Zhang notes .
The researchers are now working on making the system faster and more efficient .
One approach includes looking for enzymes that work at higher temperatures , which would speed hydrogen production rates .
The researchers also hope to produce hydrogen from cellulose , which has similar chemical formula to starch , by replacing several enzymes in the enzyme cocktail .
Zhang envisions that one day people will be able to go to their local grocery store and buy packets of solid starch or cellulose and pack it into the gas tank of their fuel - cell car .
Then it ’s a pollution - free drive to their destination — cheaper , cleaner , and more efficiently than even the most fuel - stingy gasoline - based car .
And unlike cars that burn fossil fuel , the new system would not produce any odors , he says .
Also , such a system will be safe because the hydrogen produced is consumed immediately , the researcher notes .
Alternatively , the new plant - based technology could even be used to develop an infrastructure of hydrogen - filling stations or even home - based filling stations , Zhang says .
But consumers probably wo n’t be able to take advantage of this automotive technology any time soon :
He estimates that it may take as many as 8 to 10 years to optimize the efficiency of the system so that it is suitable for use in vehicles .
A scaled - down version of the same technology could conceivably be used to create more powerful , longer lasting sugar batteries for portable music players , laptops , and cell phones , Zhang says .
That advance could take place in as few as 3 to 5 years , the researcher estimates .
Researchers at HP Labs have built the first working prototypes of an important new electronic component that may lead to instant - on PCs as well as analog computers that process information the way the human brain does .
The new component is called a memristor , or memory resistor .
Up until today , the circuit element had only been described in a series of mathematical equations written by Leon Chua , who in 1971 was an engineering student studying non-linear circuits .
Chua knew the circuit element should exist – he even accurately outlined its properties and how it would work .
Unfortunately , neither he nor the rest of the engineering community could come up with a physical manifestation that matched his mathematical expression .
Thirty - seven years later , a group of scientists from HP Labs has finally built real working memristors , thus adding a fourth basic circuit element to electrical circuit theory , one that will join the three better - known ones : the capacitor , resistor and the inductor .
Researchers believe the discovery will pave the way for instant - on PCs , more energy - efficient computers , and new analog computers that can process and associate information in a manner similar to that of the human brain .
According to R. Stanley Williams , one of four researchers at HP Labs ' Information and Quantum Systems Lab who made the discovery , the most interesting characteristic of a memristor device is that it remembers the amount of charge that flows through it .
Indeed , Chua 's original idea was that the resistance of a memristor would depend upon how much charge has gone through the device .
In other words , you can flow the charge in one direction and the resistance will increase .
If you push the charge in the opposite direction it will decrease .
Put simply , the resistance of the devices at any point in time is a function of history of the device –- or how much charge went through it either forwards or backwards .
That simple idea , now that it has been proven , will have profound effect on computing and computer science .
" Part of what 's going to come out of this is something none of us can imagine yet , " says Williams .
" But what we can imagine in and of itself is actually pretty cool . "
For one thing , Williams says these memristors can be used as either digital switches or to build a new breed of analog devices .
For the former , Williams says scientists can now think about fabricating a new type of non-volatile random access memory ( RAM ) – or memory chips that do n't forget what power state they were in when a computer is shut off .
That 's the big problem with DRAM today , he says .
" When you turn the power off on your PC , the DRAM forgets what was there .
So the next time you turn the power on you 've got to sit there and wait while all of this stuff that you need to run your computer is loaded into the DRAM from the hard disk . "
With non-volatile RAM , that process would be instantaneous and your PC would be in the same state as when you turned it off .
Scientists also envision building other types of circuits in which the memristor would be used as an analog device .
Indeed , Leon himself noted the similarity between his own predictions of the properties for a memristor and what was then known about synapses in the brain .
One of his suggestions was that you could perhaps do some type of neuronal computing using memristors .
HP
Labs thinks that 's actually a very good idea .
" Building an analog computer in which you do n't use 1s and 0s and instead use essentially all shades of gray in between is one of the things we 're already working on , " says Williams .
These computers could do the types of things that digital computers are n't very good at –- like making decisions , determining that one thing is larger than another , or even learning .
While a lot of researchers are currently trying to write a computer code that simulates brain function on a standard machine , they have to use huge machines with enormous processing power to simulate only tiny portions of the brain .
Williams and his team say they can now take a different approach : " Instead of writing a computer program to simulate a brain or simulate some brain function , we 're actually looking to build some hardware based upon memristors that emulates brain - like functions , " says Williams .
Such hardware could be used to improve things like facial recognition technology , and enable an appliance to essentially learn from experience , he says .
In principle , this should also be thousands or millions of times more efficient than running a program on a digital computer .
The results of HP Labs teams findings will be published in a paper in today 's edition of Nature .
As far as when we might see memristors actually being used in actual commercial devices , Williams says the limitations are more business oriented than technological .
Ultimately , the problem is going to be related to the time and effort involved in designing a memristor circuit , he says .
" The money invested in circuit design is actually much larger than building fabs .
In fact , you can use any fab to make these things right now , but somebody also has to design the circuits and there 's currently no memristor model .
The key is going to be getting the necessary tools out into the community and finding a niche application for memristors .
How long this will take is more of a business decision than a technological one . "

The devices act as ' memory resistors ' , with the resistance of each device depending on the amount of charge that has moved through each one .

China is determined to hold a successful Olympic Games China 's human rights record is getting worse , not better , because of the Beijing Olympics , a rights group says .
According to Amnesty International , China is clamping down on dissent in a bid to portray a stable and harmonious image ahead of the Games in August .
It urged the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and world leaders to speak out against abuses , including China 's handling of protests in Tibet .
US President George W Bush is facing calls to boycott the Games ' opening .
" It would be clearly inappropriate for you to attend the Olympic Games in China , given the increasingly repressive nature of that country 's government , " a group of 15 US politicians wrote in a letter to Mr Bush on Tuesday .
Mr Bush has said he plans to attend the ceremony but Germany 's Angela Merkel says she will not .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has not ruled out a boycott .
An IOC team is currently in Beijing to assess its readiness for the Games .
' Beyond reach '
In a report entitled China : The Olympics Countdown , the London - based group said the Olympics had failed to act as a catalyst for reform in China .
It is increasingly clear that much of the current wave of repression is occurring not in spite of the Olympics but actually because of the Olympics
Amnesty International report
Send us your comments " Unless the Chinese authorities take steps to redress the situation urgently , a positive human rights legacy for the Beijing Olympics looks increasingly beyond reach , " it said .
" It is increasingly clear that much of the current wave of repression is occurring not in spite of the Olympics but actually because of the Olympics . "
Activists and dissidents had been targeted as part of an apparent pre-Olympics clean - up , it said , with many under some form of detention .
Journalists , both domestic and foreign , were still prevented from reporting freely .
The group also called on world leaders to speak out on the situation in Tibet , calling a failure to address the issue " tacit endorsement " of human rights abuses .
It accused Chinese troops of using lethal force on Tibetan protesters and urged China to release information about those who had been detained , saying it feared for their safety .
' Prejudice '
On Tuesday , ahead of the publication of the report , China hit out at Amnesty and said any attempt to pressure Beijing over the Olympics would fail .
" The organisation holds prejudice against China , so you can imagine what kind of report it will release , " foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said .
Public Security Ministry spokesman Wu Heping also said that Tibetan " independence forces " were planning to launch suicide attacks as part of a wider uprising - a move he blamed on the Dalai Lama .
China says 18 civilians and two police officers died in the unrest in Tibetan and neighbouring provinces inhabited by Tibetans that began on 10 March .
Tibetan groups outside China put the death toll at up to 140 , a figure that includes Tibetans they say were killed by Chinese security forces .
All claims about the unrest are difficult to verify because the Chinese government has mostly barred foreign journalists from these sensitive areas .

What are these ?
Pope Benedict XVI ’s visit to the United States has provided the requisite quota of breathlessly televised pageantry .
But the most dramatic moment in his brief visit surely was his meeting with three Catholics who , as children , suffered sexual abuse at the hands of priests .
Benedict called for the church to do more for the thousands who endured similar outrages .
Los Angeles ’ Cardinal Roger M. Mahony echoed that sentiment following the meeting .
“ We ’ve got to face it [ the abuse crisis ] head on and deal with it , ” he told The Times .
The pope , he said , “ asked us to set a better tone in the church . ”
Back in Los Angeles , where the archdiocese reached a record $ 660 - million settlement with hundreds of abuse victims last summer , Mahony is already engaged in an unprecedented exercise that sheds light on what that new tone may entail .
Combined with an earlier payout , the 2007 settlement brought the archdiocese ’s total liability to $ 720 million .
When Mahony announced the agreement , he pledged that it would not involve the sale of any parish or school properties , as has occurred in other dioceses .
Most local Catholics took that as an assurance that their parishes would n’t be asked to pay for pedophiles .

In the months since , however , the cardinal and his lay financial advisors have decided that the archdiocese -- which already has drastically cut staff , sold real estate and liquidated investments -- must seek help from at least some of its parishes if it is to repay a bank loan of about $ 50 million that was taken out to cover part of the settlement .
There are 288 parishes in the archdiocese , and their money is held in a common investment pool -- currently $ 600 million -- managed by the archdiocese .
Many older , more affluent parishes have what amount to endowments built up over many years .
In February , Mahony wrote to the pastors of 101 parishes , telling them that because they are part of “ a group of parishes with cash investments of $ 1 million or more
On Friday , archdiocese spokesman Todd Tamberg told The Times that “ the funding of the settlement of the civil cases , which did not include any parish or parish school assets , required a substantial amount of borrowing by the archdiocese ’s administrative office .
Increasing the revenues of the archdiocese administrative office and decreasing the amount of settlement debt through voluntary parish loans and grants ” will allow the diocese to go on providing essential services .
The $ 50 - million loan that must be repaid is held by Allied Irish Bank , and the archdiocese was forced to put up six Catholic high school facilities as collateral -- Daniel Murphy ( slated to close this June ) , St. Bernard , Bishop Montgomery , Bishop Amat , Damien , Bishop Conaty - Loretto and St. Bonaventure .
Whatever the 101 parishes decide , Tamberg said , “ the archdiocese has no intention whatsoever of selling any of these high schools . ”
There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the archdiocese on this question .
But making collateral of schools demonstrates just how deeply into the fabric of diocesan life the abuse crisis has reached .

So does Mahony ’s extraordinary personal appeal to the parishes for voluntary contributions .
Over the past weeks , he has personally appeared at 20 regional meetings to apologize for his own role in the crisis , to urge further understanding of the victims ’ injury and to appeal for financial help .
Most pastors have submitted the request to their lay parish and financial councils .
Many plan meetings before the end - of - May deadline the cardinal set for a response .
Mahony ’s efforts are playing out against an extraordinary backdrop .
What ’s come to be called “ the abuse crisis ” involved a tiny fraction of American priests , but the majority of the country ’s bishops were either negligent or overtly malfeasant in the way they dealt with the crimes .
In an article published Friday in the Tablet , an influential British Catholic newspaper , the American commentator George Weigel pointed out that Catholics have “ rallied to the support of the good priests they knew -- who were , after all , 97 % ( at least ) of the American presbyterate -- and one senses no lingering anger at priests .
There is , however , residual anger at bishops who failed to act , who protected abusive clergy , who have put their diocese under financial pressure and who have not been called to account . ”
In his attempt to persuade Los Angeles Catholics to dip into their parish reserves to compensate victims who suffered abuse under three cardinals , Mahony has chosen to rely on moral authority rather than his power as a prince of the church .
It ’s an important test of his own relationship with the people in the pews -- a plebiscite of sorts on whether L.A. 's Catholics believe their church and its cardinal really have learned from this wrenching tragedy .

The blog where I found this list brings up some good points .
How many of these were actual , valid terror threats and what price did the American people pay to feel protected ?
We know our government will try to scare the pants off of us at every opportunity , they do n't even need credible evidence to do it .
I do n't like to link to FOXNews ' website , but I did just in case someone thought I was making this up or it was a joke .
For those of you who do n't want to give them the hits , I 've posted the entire list below the fold .
As always , I 'm sure the C&L faithful with will have this fact - checked in no time .
Sincerely , Logan Hussein Murphy
When I first left home and settled in a new city , I noticed after a few weeks that we had a large local population of two sorts of folk I had n't come across before : crack whores , and evangelists .
It was a nice - looking area on the edge of a park , surrounded by large , decaying Victorian mansions .
Once it had been very gentrified , but by now it had gone to seed and most of the houses were split into tiny flats filled mainly with the scabby unemployed , like me .
I lived at the top of an enormous mouldy Gothic pile , the sort of house that looks really interesting and picturesque if you do n't live there .
It had dragon gargoyles , a huge marble tiled hallway , a wide , grand oak staircase with a fifteen - feet - high stained - glass window above it , several floors , one toilet and 24 inmates .
It stank to high heaven .
All the rooms had once been beautiful and would have been again , if the landlord had been interested in anything apart from skimming money off his tenants .
The solitary bathroom was big enough for a party , with a moulded plaster frieze of bathing nymphs and a panelled bath deep enough to swim in .
But the green rust and dubious stains were a little off - putting , and everything was rotting : the nymphs had no noses , which was just as well for them .
There was a small spooky wooden back staircase leading to the attic , which was cut in half to make two long narrow dank bedsits .
One held me and the lad I was living with ; the other was occupied by J and R , a pair of gay brothers on the run from darkest Somerset .
Angelically beautiful , excellent fun , they knew the prostitutes on the corner quite well and often picked up condoms for them from the local shop ( which had banned them , hoping they 'd move their patch elsewhere ) .
There were about ten girls in total who worked the corner , all run by the same notorious pimp and all crack addicts .
Sometimes J and R would stop and gossip while I was with them , but the girls and I never got friendly , although we always swapped hellos .
I guess what they did scared me a little , and made them defensive .
I got to know their habits after a while , the way you do with neighbours .
The crack whore day seemed to consist of sleeping late and starting work around seven , earlier in winter .
They did a seven - day week with long shifts and grim working conditions .
Even on snowy nights they never wore any tights or stockings , standing there on their corner with their skinny mottled purple legs sticking out from beneath a plastic skirt , like frozen chickens .
They were usually fairly busy : a good fifty percent of the night traffic in the area was made up of cruising punters .
I asked J once how much they made in an evening .
" Oh , plenty , " he said , " but most of it 's gone on crack by midnight . "
Walking back across the park late at night , I 'd see the girls trooping off to the crack house to spend their earnings .
It was the big place on the corner , the one with about fifteen Rottweilers in residence and half a ton of dogshit in the yard .
I guess you could see why the evangelists thought the area needed sorting out .
The evangelists were legion .
Mostly of Caribbean origin , they all worshipped at a funny little home - made church in a basement opposite our house .
I can't remember its exact title : Church of the Flaming Fury and all the Heavenly Angels , or something like that .
I liked it at first because they sang , gospel - style , with lots of hearty hallelujahs .
The spectacle of them all coming out was also quite something : all dressed up to kingdom come in satin turbans , multicoloured silk dresses , big decorated fancy hats .
Ancient grannies in fuchsia lace , stately serene mothers , tiny kids in bridesmaid - style dresses , painfully neat boys in ties and suits with red necks from their mothers ' scrubbings .
I soon learnt to avoid them after being chased up the road by a lady shouting loudly about LUST !
and waving a tract at me .
They were determined to convert every sinner in the neighbourhood .
Tied to their corner by their job and unable to run away or slam the door like the rest of us , the crack whores were sitting ducks .
If the evangelists had brought food or warm clothing they might have been welcome , but conversion by fear seemed to be their only tactic : befriending the crack whores or doing anything practical to help just would n't have occurred to them .
The crack whores were an abomination unto the Lord , and deserved hellfire , or at the very least a good tongue - lashing .
So most days of the week there 'd be a loud battle on the corner , the crack whores trying to make their living on one side while some silk - frocked old girl stood on the other side with arms akimbo , hollering damnation in a fruity Jamaican accent on their hapless heads .
Eventually the crack whores would start hollering back and then everyone would join in .
Half the neighbours came out and stood on their doorsteps to watch and throw in their opinions : casual passers - by stopped to cheer on one side or the other , usually the whores .
It was n't that we were especially matey with them , but most people had some sympathy with their shitty jobs , and we all hated the evangelists .
Hard not to : they seemed to hate everyone else .
I was living in sin .
J and R were gay and thus automatically minions of the devil .
The violinist next door was an unmarried mother and regularly got shouted at in front of her kid .
All of us had been brought up not to be rude to old ladies , and were not at all sure what to do when old ladies were rude to us .
So it went on , until one week , when one of the whores was murdered .
She was just twenty , and it was a horribly gruesome murder involving knives .
For a couple of days after it the street corner was empty .
Local people left flowers in the spot where she had been found , and for a while nobody went out alone at night .
The pimp was losing money though , so three nights after the murder the girls were back in their usual place , very scared by it all .
One large evangelist lady obviously saw her chance to preach on the wages of sin , so she marched herself out to the corner , and started up her rant .
Five minutes later she found herself surrounded by a mob of neighbours .
They did n't shout at her : they just clustered round her and stared , and kept staring , until eventually she shut up and went home .
I guess the crack whores won in the end , for nobody bothered them after that , and the following month the church was relocated elsewhere .
We were all glad to see the back of it , but I missed the singing , sometimes .

WASHINGTON — Members of Congress have as much as $ 196 million collectively invested in companies doing business with the Defense Department , earning millions since the onset of the Iraq war , according to a study by a nonpartisan research group .
Not all the companies in which lawmakers invested are typical defense contractors .
Corporations such as PepsiCo , IBM , Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson have at one point received defense - related contracts , notes the report by the Washington - based Center for Responsive Politics .
The center ’s review of lawmakers ’ 2006 financial disclosure statements suggests that members ’ holdings could pose a conflict of interest as they decide the fate of Iraq war spending .
Several members earning money from these contractors have plum committee or leadership assignments , including Democratic Sen.
John Kerry , independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman and House Republican Whip Roy Blunt .

DID Google , the world 's largest web - search engine , peak last November 6th , when its share price hit an all - time high of $ 742 ?
Some people on Wall Street seem to think so .
They now value the firm at around 40 % less .
Part of the blame belongs to the general turmoil in the stockmarket .
But the bigger part , investors fear , is that Google , at the ripe old age of nine , might already be over the hill .
The scare started when comScore , a research firm , reported in late February that Google 's “ paid clicks ” had decreased by 7 % during January , and were flat compared with the same month a year earlier .
In other words , surfers who searched the web via Google itself , or who visited websites that belong to Google 's advertising network , clicked slightly less frequently on the little text advertisements that Google often places on these pages .
The idea that this disappointment was some sort of seasonal blip faded on March 26th when comScore reported that the numbers for February were no better .
Alas , as so often in the nebulous business of online advertising , the devil is hiding somewhere underneath the numbers , and probably planning some mischief .
The first possibility is that web users performed fewer web searches , leading to fewer results pages , ads and clicks .
This turns out not to be the explanation .
Web searches on Google grew in January , and dipped only slightly in February .
Google 's market share of searches also continues to grow .
This means that the ratio of paid clicks to searches dropped even faster than the number of paid clicks : it was down by 16 % in the month of January .
Perhaps America 's foreclosure crisis and fear of recession among consumers have caused a downturn in advertising ?
That is possible , but unlikely , at least so far .
eMarketer , another research firm , projects that online advertising in America will grow by 23 % this year , economic troubles notwithstanding , because the measurability of the medium is too compelling for marketers to ignore .
More to the point , users of rival search engines such as Yahoo !
or MSN actually clicked more often on search ads during January and February .
For the explanation to be economic , consumers using Google would therefore have to be more worried than those using other search engines .
This makes no sense .
According to comScore , the likeliest explanation is instead that Google itself is to blame — by , paradoxically , increasing the quality of its ads .
Google does this in two ways .
First , it offers fewer ads on each results page , and often none at all .
This reduces visual clutter and pleases both users and any remaining advertisers .
Second ,
Google seems to be trying harder to weed out those advertisers who bid low in the auctions it conducts for advertising slots linked to particular keywords .
Low bids indicate that advertisers do not expect the ads to generate much business .
With less space devoted to ads , and only higher - bidding advertisers getting through , there are fewer ads to click on .
But would users not click just as often , or even more often , on those remaining ads , since they are now presumably easier to see and more relevant ?
Perhaps not .
From Google 's point of view , a perfect system would result in each ad not only being clicked each time but also leading to a sale by the advertiser .
Google interprets lots of clicking without subsequent purchasing to mean that its ads are not very good .
So if the drop in paid clicks turns out to coincide with more conversions into actual sales , Google 's revenue for each individual click ought to shoot up , since the marketers would be prepared to pay more .
That in turn might mean that aggregate revenue growth for Google could still be healthy .
In a nutshell , this is what drove Google 's revenue last year : it grew by 56 % on the back of a 21 % increase in revenue per paid click .
Since Google does not disclose its revenue per click , however , Wall Street wo n't know whether the click data are good news or bad until April 17th , when Google reports on its first quarter .
Until then , the case of the mysterious missing clicks remains unsolved .
The Maya women sit patiently in the lobby of Clinica Oscar Romero , playing with their children and speaking in their native dialects of Kanjobal and Quiche .
Idalia Xuncax knows all of the women .
She is their guide , translator and advocate in a healthcare world so foreign from their villages in Guatemala , where many relied on herbal medicines and faith healers .
For eight years , Xuncax -- who is also Maya -- has reached out to other Mayas and gained the trust of a community that has generally been reluctant to seek Western medical treatment .
Largely because of Xuncax ’s work , the number of Maya patients at the Los Angeles clinic has grown from just a few eight years ago to about 700 today .
Many have diabetes , high blood pressure or high cholesterol .
But despite the gains , Xuncax and the clinic on Alvarado Street face daunting obstacles , including a shortage of interpreters and cultural differences that deter Mayas from seeking care , which can affect their health .
Xuncax struggles constantly to get patients to show up for appointments and to take their medicine .
She has to convince them that prenatal care wo n’t harm the fetus and that unprotected sex can lead to HIV .

“ It ’s not that they do n’t want to be helped or be healthy , ” Xuncax said .
“ Mostly , it ’s cultural , that we do n’t see doctors where we are from .
We do n’t have the flexibility of having a hospital or a clinic nearby . ”
Some of the issues Xuncax encounters with her Guatemalan patients are commonly dealt with by doctors and nurses in California working with indigenous populations from Mexico and other parts of Latin America , experts said .
Healthcare providers must realize that patients may come to a hospital or a clinic but are also seeking medical guidance from community elders and taking herbal medicines , said David Hayes - Bautista , who directs UCLA ’s Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture .
“ You really need to understand the rest of the medical care world that these folks live in , of which standard Western medicine is only one facet , ” he said .
Milton Alvarez , Guatemala ’s consul general in Los Angeles , said healthcare is critical for Guatemalans living here , especially the Mayas , who may never have had regular access to doctors .
Advertisement
Members of the community depend on Clinica Romero to offer health services in their language .
Tens of thousands of Mayas , including Kanjobal , Quiche and Mam , live in the area , primarily concentrated in the Pico - Union and Westlake neighborhoods .
Maria Baltazar , 28 , who is Kanjobal , started going to the clinic when she was pregnant with her third child , now 6 .
During her prenatal care , Baltazar said she learned that she had early stage cervical cancer .
Baltazar said she encourages other Maya women to seek prenatal care and get gynecological exams .
“ I tell them it ’s very important , ” she said .
“ If I had n’t gone , I would have gotten advanced cancer . ”
Like many immigrants , some Mayas are reluctant to seek medical care for fear of being deported or because they do not have insurance and do n’t know that they can receive free services at Clinica Romero .
The clinic receives private donations , as well as Los Angeles County , state and federal funds .
Advertisement
Xuncax , who emigrated from Guatemala in 1981 and is now a U.S. citizen , was hired at Clinica Romero in 2000 as an interpreter and soon became a case manager .
Like many of her patients , she has a round face and short stature , standing just 4 feet , 8 inches tall .
She speaks English , Spanish and Kanjobal fluently .
When Xuncax started at the clinic , she immediately posted fliers in Kanjobal at schools , stores and hospitals .
But because many Mayas can’t read or write , the fliers did n’t help .
So she printed new ones in Spanish and English , with pictures of Maya women and children .
Then the patients came -- and started bringing their children , parents and neighbors .
“ The word got out all around Pico - Union , ” Xuncax said .
Clinic staff , including Alba Escobar , who heads the women and children program , met with Maya leaders to gain their support .
And the clinic received a federal grant to do a healthcare study about Mayas living in Los Angeles .
Advertisement
“ We did n’t know anything about the Mayan community , except they were living around the clinic , ” Escobar said .
“ We decided to find out more about them and see what more we could do . ”
They went to soccer fields , churches and supermarkets and talked to hundreds of Mayas , finding that many were waiting until they ended up in an emergency room to seek medical care .
With another grant , the clinic started treating Maya patients .
A Kanjobal speaker was put at the front desk , easily accessible to patients .
But many patients still went directly to Xuncax ’s office , often with concerns that had nothing to do with healthcare .
On a recent night , a woman asked if she could fill out her application for WIC , a federally funded program for women , infants and children .
Advertisement
“ If I do n’t do it , who is going to ? ” Xuncax said .
She said she tries to teach her patients to take control of their own healthcare , but often she has to start with basic information , including what diabetes is and how a woman gets pregnant .
Xuncax said her next goal is to offer classes in indigenous languages on topics such as family planning , first aid for children and oral health .

I used to think , " Bravo " when these guys resigned because they disagree with the Bush regime .
But , the more I think about it , they 're not helping at all !
Resigning is n't fighting the Bush regime , it 's just stepping down so the Bush regime can put in someone who can really do damage to our country .
So , when all is said and done , these guys stepping down actually do MORE damage , because they allow a crony to be appointed to their position , as they sit by the sidelines and watch our country go down the shitter !
IE , " I 'm stepping aside for someone to REALLY do some damage ... as I sit and watch on the sidelines .
And maybe write a book about it . "

I hear you Ancient however , it 's their pile of shit they created so i believe these treasonous destructors need to live in it for a while .
I would love to prosecute or watch a seasoned intelligent lawyer of the people get these insulated fcks on the stand facing consecutive life sentences for ALL Americans and world citizens to watch on TV for their multiple crimes against humanity , the constitution , and their war against other species .
In other words using anti-science to advocate accelerating Global Warming , changing the rules of US forestry so the people effectively no longer have a voice , a Congress directed by pres of senate cheney that reversed over 250 environmental laws and lowered over 400 health standards previously set , AND a plan to sell off the Western Federal wild lands and allow off road vehicle destruction .
Finally that dumb ace bastard McCain who is gonna represent the criminal rupublithug party deserves honorable mention before the next rigged election .
He 's been showing commericals in Montana making jokes and complaining about 3 million spent to study their populations of isolated brown bears .
While the actual figure McCain states is incorrect because it was 5 mill to count and verify the actual bear numbers , this fck has no problem spending billions and billions of US taxpayer dollars occupying a country that posed no threat to the US killing 1000's of people to take their oil .
While we know lies and the repeated excuse about ties to 9/11 were used to advocate the initial invasion of Iraq , this damaged soldier wants to remain there for the next 100 years by his own words .
The following Washinton Post link is about a bear scientist involved in the study and people who disagree with his opinion that the bear study was wasteful .

Well just like all the rest of the Generals and Admirals etc that have been fired & retired the last 7 years , the ones that had at least some sense and enough self respect & honor to stand up to these treasonous bastards " Admiral Fallon " has no doubt fallen to the same fate so he could be replaced by some complete boot licking religiously insane lunatic member of the " Christian Embassy " .
This is because nobody is standing up to these criminals in numbers , all of Congress is totally complicit in ALL of the crimes committed the past 7 years , Congress is utterly worthless .
Fellow military personnel are not standing behind those few that refuse to abide by the naked nut bag Emperor , they just stand there while those few commit career sepaku .
We the People , ALL OF US are just standing around watching while those very few that stand up and try to stop what is happening get cut down one at a time .
We are all guilty of allowing this to happen and I personally am ashamed & embarrassed to be called American . " " I just think science and religion DON 'T happen to disagree .
I do n't take the bible literally .
I do take it to conscience though .
Particularly , the New Testament , that old stuff people are stuck on , is just that , OLD .

As for this , sorry but I have been Marine Biologist all my life ( recently retired ) and I can say without any doubt that Religion is diametrically opposed to Science .
The fundamentalist of any flavor are even diametrically opposed to factual reality .
These people do n't even live on this planet , their body may be here but their mind whats left of it is inhabiting some far off planet where their little sun god waved his magic wand and spewed a few choice words of Hebrew to magically create the Earth & the entire universe trillions upon trillions of stars , planets and even the space in between * poof * , the world they live in is full of demons & angels , talking snakes , giants & mythical beings of fairy tales .
The world they live in is under the total control of their supernatural sun god .
Science has no place in that world .
Those " simple commandments " btw are Jewish tenets not Christian and the Hebrews copied them from the Egyptian " 42 Admonitions of Ma'at " written some 1000 + years before Judaism was even a sparkle in some bronze age Bedouins eye .
The NT is an Astrological Drama written in the old Pagan Passion play style , the majority of it was meant as a stage play to be acted out on stage which is why it was written in verses .
The main characters are all allegorical NOT " historical " .
Jesus = The SUN
John the Baptist = Aquarius
The 2 Fishermen = Pisces
Mary = Virgo
and so on , all characters in a play and all allegorical for solar / celestial deities .
This has been proven many times over with Archaeological evidence .

In the aftermath , he had been wounded at least five different times by fragmentation and concussion grenades in the chest , arms , right calf , knee , right and left thighs .
Eighty - three fragments were later removed .
He never complained and refused medical evacuation until his men were settled into their night defensive positions .
Born on the Sisseton - Wahpeton Indian reservation in 1917 , Woodrow Wilson Keeble joined the North Dakota National Guard in 1942 while the Chicago White Sox were trying to recruit the big athlete .
He served with Company I , 164th Infantry Regiment , Americal Division , the first US Army unit on Guadalcanal .
They fought side - side with the Marines ; fighting that earned praise from Leatherneck commanders , one of whom ( Col. Clifton B. Cates ) wrote that they were " honored to serve with such a unit as yours . "
In an article about Keeble at the Army news site , fellow I Company member James Fenelon is quoted as recalling that " men of the 164th rallied around this full - blooded Sioux whose accuracy with the Browning Automatic Rifle was unparalleled . "
( A detailed account of Marine - Army combat on Guadalcanal can be found here . )
34 year old 1st Sgt. Keeble volunteered for Korea as an individual augmentee from the 164th Infantry and was assigned to G Company , 2nd Battalion , 19th Infantry .
On October 20 , 1951 he had taken charge of G Company after all of its officers had been killed or badly wounded during the 24th Division 's participation in Operation Nomad .
Its objective : push the Chinese communists off of their fortified winter line and take the city of Kumsong .
This was a mission made more difficult by the fact that Chinese troops had taken advantage of a recent lull in the fighting to build trench - tunnel and bunker systems into the rugged mountains .
This was the deadly terrain facing G Company and 1st Sgt. Keeble .
( Read more about Operation Nomad here . )
From the account in Army.mil / news :
Fellow G Company 1st Sgt. Kosumo Sagami later wrote that Keeble led all three platoons in successive assaults upon the Chinese who held the hill throughout the day .
All three charges were repulsed , and the company suffered heavy casualties .
The trenches were filled with enemy soldiers , fortified by three pillboxes containing machine guns and additional men , surrounded the hill .
Following the third assault and subsequent mortar and artillery support , the enemy sustained casualties among its ranks in the open trenches .
The machine gunners in the pillboxes , however , continued to direct fire on the company .
Sagami said after Keeble withdrew the 3rd platoon , he decided to attempt a solo assault . [....]
Armed with grenades and his Browning Automatic Rifle , Keeble crawled to an area 50 yards from the ridgeline , flanked the left pillbox and used grenades and rifle fire to eliminate it , according to Sagami .
After returning to the point where 1st Platoon held the company 's first line of defense , Keeble worked his way to the opposite side of the ridgeline and took out the right pillbox with grenades .
" Then without hesitation , he lobbed a grenade into the back entrance of the middle pillbox and with additional rifle fire eliminated it , " Sagami added . [....]
( Keeble 's stepson Russell ) Hawkins said one eyewitness told him the enemy directed its entire arsenal at Keeble during his assault : " ... there were so many grenades coming down on Woody , that it looked like a flock of blackbirds . "
Even under heavy enemy fire , Keeble was able to complete his objective .
Only after he killed the machine gunners did Keeble order his men to advance and secure the hill .
Every surviving member of G Company recommended Keeble for the Medal of Honor , twice , but the paperwork was lost , and he was given the next highest award , the Distinguished Service Cross in 1952 .
Over the years , efforts continued to have that DSC upgraded .
Woodrow Wilson Keeble died in North Dakota in 1982 .
Finally , in December 2007 , a bill signed by all North and South Dakota senators authorizing President Bush to award Keeble the Medal of Honor was passed .
Tomorrow , in a White House ceremony , Russell Hawkins will accept the Medal for his stepfather Master Sgt. Woodrow " Woody " Keeble .
Among those in attendance will be some of Woody 's North Dakota friends from the Circle of Nations , formerly Wahpeton Indian School , where he taught .
The Medal of Honor will rest atop his other awards and decorations , which include the Silver Star , 3 Bronze Stars and 4 Purple Hearts .
Woodrow Keeble , a good , friendly , quiet man , as so many true heroes are , later talked about being in combat .
" There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime , an endlessness , when terror was so strong in me that I could feel idiocy replace reason .
Yet I have never left my position .
Never have I shirked hazardous duty .
Fear did not make a coward out of me . "
His proud stepson has said , " Woody epitomized our cultural values of humility , compassion , bravery , strength " and " the embodiment of the Sioux word woyuonihan " or honor .
The deeds of Woodrow Keeble and all of our heroes are timeless , and they serve as an inspiration to us all as we strive to lead exemplary lives .

It should be an obvious rule - do n't try to have your picture taken with a crocodile by waving fish bait at it .
As this startled tourist discovered , it wo n't work .
And it annoys the crocodile .
The 12ft beast launched itself from the aptly named South Alligator River in Northern Territory , Australia , and tried to dine on Israeli backpacker Novon Mashiah .
Scroll down for more ...
Say cheese : Novon Mashiah points towards the croc and grins for the camera
Not so funny now :
The croc lunges for Mr Mashiah , saved only by the size of his boat
Mr Mashiah , 27 , just managed to jump clear on his small fishing boat - as these pictures taken by a friend in another boat show - and escaped with nothing more than a case of severe embarrassment .
" I saw this crocodile and thought I 'd tease it a bit with a small piece of bait , just to get it in quite close to me for the picture , " he said .
" I was playing around , pointing at it , laughing - when it suddenly jumped up at me .
I did n't realise crocs were so aggressive . "
His antics drew a typically forthright response from Australians writing to the local paper .
One said : " What the bloody hell did you expect ?
That the croc would jump up , put his arm around your neck and smile for the camera ? "
Another wrote : " What a dimwit .
Considering you still have both hands , use one of them to slap yourself ! "
When the Tonkin Gulf incident took place in early August 1964 , I was a journeyman CIA analyst in what Condoleezza Rice refers to as “ the bowels of the agency . ”
As a current intelligence analyst responsible for Russian policy toward Southeast Asia and China , I worked very closely with those responsible for analysis of Vietnam and China .
Out of that experience I must say that , as much as one might be tempted to laugh at the bizarre , theatrical accounts of last week ’s incident involving small Iranian boats and U.S. naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz , this is  as my old Russian professor used to insist  nothing to laugh .
The situation is so reminiscent of what happened  and did n’t happen  from Aug. 2 - 4 , 1964 , in the Gulf of Tonkin and in Washington , it is in no way funny .
At the time , the U.S. had about 16,000 troops in South Vietnam .
The war that was “ justified ” by the Tonkin Gulf resolution of Aug.
7 , 1964 , led to a buildup of 535,000 U.S. troops in the late Sixties , 58,000 of whom were killed  not to mention the estimated 2 million Vietnamese who lost their lives by then and in the ensuing 10 years .
Ten years .
How can our president speak so glibly about 10 more years of a U.S. armed presence in Iraq ?
He must not remember Vietnam .
Lessons From Vietnam and Iraq
What follows is written primarily for honest intelligence analysts and managers still on “ active duty . ”
The issuance of the recent National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran was particularly welcome to those of us who had been hoping there were enough of you left who had not been thoroughly corrupted by former CIA Director George Tenet and his malleable managers .
We are not so much surprised at the integrity of Tom Fingar , who is in charge of national intelligence analysis .
He showed his mettle in manfully resisting forgeries and fairy tales about Saddam Hussein ’s “ weapons of mass destruction . ”
What is , frankly , a happy surprise is the fact that he and other non-ideologues and non-careerist professionals have been able to prevail and speak truth to power on such dicey issues as the Iranian nuclear program , the upsurge in terrorism caused by the U.S. invasion of Iraq , and the year - old NIE saying Iraq is headed for hell in a hand basket ( with no hint that a “ surge ” could make a difference ) .
But those are the NIEs .
They share the status of “ supreme genre ” of analytic product with the President ’s Daily Brief and other vehicles for current intelligence , the field in which I labored , first in the analytic trenches and then as a briefer at the White House , for most of my 27 - year career .
True , the NIE “ Iraq ’s Continuing Program for Weapons of Mass Destruction ” of Oct. 1 , 2002 ( wrong on every major count ) , greased the skids for the attack on Iraq on March 19 , 2003 .
But it is more often current intelligence that is fixed upon to get the country into war .
The Tonkin Gulf events are perhaps the best case in point .
We retired professionals who worked through the Tonkin Gulf incident are hopeful that Fingar can ensure integrity in the current intelligence process as well .
Salivating for a Wider War
Given the confusion last Sunday in the Persian Gulf , you need to remember that a “ known known ” in the form of a non-event has already been used to sell a major war  Vietnam .
It is not only in retrospect that we know that no attack occurred that night .
Those of us in intelligence , not to mention President Lyndon Johnson , Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , and National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy , all knew full well that the evidence of any armed attack on the evening of Aug.
4 , 1964 , the so - called “ second ” Tonkin Gulf incident , was highly dubious .
But it fit the president ’s purposes , so they lent a hand to facilitate escalation of the war .
During the summer of 1964 , President Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were eager to widen the war in Vietnam .
They stepped up sabotage and hit - and - run attacks on the coast of North Vietnam .
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara later admitted that he and other senior leaders had concluded that the seaborne attacks “ amounted to little more than pinpricks ” and “ were essentially worthless , ” but they continued .
Concurrently , the National Security Agency was ordered to collect signals intelligence from the North Vietnamese coast on the Gulf of Tonkin , and the surprise coastal attacks were seen as a helpful way to get the North Vietnamese to turn on their coastal radars .
The destroyer USS Maddox , carrying electronic spying gear , was authorized to approach as close as eight miles from the coast and four miles from offshore islands , some of which already had been subjected to intense shelling by clandestine attack boats .
As James Bamford describes it in Body of Secrets :
“ The twin missions of the Maddox were in a sense symbiotic .
The vessel ’s primary purpose was to act as a seagoing provocateur  to poke its sharp gray bow and the American flag as close to the belly of North Vietnam as possible , in effect shoving its 5 - inch cannons up the nose of the Communist navy .
In turn , this provocation would give the shore batteries an excuse to turn on as many coastal defense radars , fire control systems , and communications channels as possible , which could then be captured by the men at the radar screens .
The more provocation , the more signals
“ The Maddox ‘s mission was made even more provocative by being timed to coincide with commando raids , creating the impression that the Maddox was directing those missions and possibly even lobbing firepower in their support .
“ North Vietnam also claimed at least a twelve - mile limit and viewed the Maddox as a trespassing ship deep within its territorial waters . ” ( pp. 295-296 )
On Aug. 2 , 1964 , an intercepted message ordered North Vietnamese torpedo boats to attack the Maddox .
The destroyer was alerted and raced out to sea beyond reach of the torpedoes , three of which were fired in vain at the destroyer ’s stern .
The Maddox ‘s captain suggested that the rest of his mission be called off , but the Pentagon refused .
And still more commando raids were launched on Aug. 3 , shelling for the first time targets on the mainland , not just the offshore islands .
Early on Aug. 4 , the Maddox ‘s captain cabled his superiors that the North Vietnamese believed his patrol to be directly involved with the commando raids and shelling .
That evening at 7:15 ( Vietnam time ) the Pentagon alerted the Maddox to intercepted messages indicating that another attack by patrol boats was imminent .
What followed was panic and confusion .
There was a score of reports of torpedo and other hostile attacks , but no damage and growing uncertainty as to whether any attack actually took place .
McNamara was told that “ freak radar echoes ” were misinterpreted by “ young fellows ” manning the sonar , who were “ apt to say any noise is a torpedo . ”
This did not prevent McNamara from testifying to Congress two days later that there was “ unequivocal proof ” of a new attack .
And based largely on that , Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf resolution bringing 10 more years of war .
Meanwhile , in the Trenches
By the afternoon of Aug. 4 , the CIA ’s expert analyst on North Vietnam ( let ’s call him “ Tom ” ) had concluded that probably no one had fired on the U.S. ships .
He included a paragraph to that effect in the item he wrote for the “ current intelligence bulletin , ” which would be wired to the White House and other key agencies and appear in print the next morning .
And then something unique happened .
The director of the Office of Current Intelligence , a very senior officer whom Tom had never before seen , descended into the bowels of the agency to order the paragraph deleted .
He explained :
“ We ’re not going to tell LBJ that now .
He has already decided to bomb North Vietnam .
We have to keep our lines open to the White House . ”
“ Tom ” later bemoaned  quite rightly : “ What do we need open lines for , if we ’re not going to use them , and use them to tell the truth ? ”
Two years ago , I would have been tempted to comment sarcastically , “ How quaint ; how obsolete . ”
But the good news is that the analysts writing the NIEs have now reverted to the ethos in which “ Tom ” and I were proud to work .
Now the analysts / reporters of current intelligence need to follow suit , and we hope Tom Fingar can hold their feet to the fire .
For if they do n’t measure up , the consequences are sure to be disastrous .
This should be obvious in the wake of the Tonkin Gulf reporting experience , not to mention more recent performance of senior officials before the attack on Iraq in 2003 .
The late Ray S. Cline , who was the current intelligence director ’s boss at the time of the Tonkin Gulf incident , said he was “ very sure ” that no attack took place on Aug .
4 . He suggested that McNamara had shown the president unevaluated signals intelligence that referred to the ( real ) earlier attack on Aug. 2 rather than the non-event on the 4th .
There was no sign of remorse on Cline ’s part that he did n’t step in and make sure the president was told the truth .
We in the bowels knew there was no attack ; and so did the director of Current Intelligence as well as Cline , the deputy director for intelligence .
But all knew , as did McNamara , that President Johnson was lusting for a pretext to strike the North and escalate the war .
And , like Br’er Rabbit , they did n’t say nothin’ .
Commenting on the interface of intelligence and policy on Vietnam , a senior CIA officer has written ,
“ [ T ] he dilemma CIA directors and senior intelligence professionals face in cases when they know that unvarnished intelligence judgments will not be welcomed by the president , his policy managers , and his political advisers .
[ They ] must decide whether to tell it like it is ( and so risk losing their place at the president ’s advisory table ) , or to go with the flow of existing policy by accentuating the positive ( thus preserving their access and potential influence ) .
In these episodes from the Vietnam era , we have seen that senior CIA officers more often than not tended toward the latter approach . ” ( CIA and the Vietnam Policymakers : Three Episodes , 1962 - 1968 , Harold P. Ford )
Back to Iran .
This time , we all know what the president and vice president are lusting after  an excuse to attack Iran .
But there is a big difference from the situation in the summer of 1964 , when President Johnson had intimidated all his senior subordinates into using deceit to escalate the war .
Bamford comments on the disingenuousness of Robert McNamara when he testified in 1968 that it was “ inconceivable ” that senior officials , including the president , deliberately used the Tonkin Gulf events to generate congressional support for a wider Vietnam War .
In Bamford ’s words , the Joint Chiefs of Staff had become “ a sewer of deceit , ” with Operation Northwoods and other unconscionable escapades to their credit .
Then - Undersecretary of State George Ball commented , “ There was a feeling that if the destroyer got into some trouble , that this would provide the provocation we needed . ”
Good News : It ’s Different Now
It is my view that the only thing that has prevented Bush and Cheney from attacking Iran so far has been the strong opposition of the uniformed military , including the Joint Chiefs .
As the misadventure last week in the Strait of Hormuz shows , our senior military officers need all the help they can get from intelligence officers more concerned with the truth than with “ keeping lines open to the White House ” and doing its bidding .
In addition , the intelligence oversight committees in Congress seem to be waking from their Rip Van Winkle - like slumber .
It was Congress , after all , that ordered the controversial NIE on Iran / nuclear ( and insisted it be publicized ) .
And the flow of substantive intelligence to Congress is much larger than it was in 1964 when , remember , there were no intelligence committees as such .
So , you inheritors of the honorable profession of current intelligence 
I ’m thinking of you , Rochelle , and you , Rick  do n’t let them grind you down .
If you ’re working in the bowels of the CIA and you find that your leaders are cooking the intelligence once again into a recipe for casus belli , think long and hard about your oath to protect the Constitution .
Should that oath not transcend any secrecy promise you had to accept as a condition of employment ?
By sticking your neck out , you might be able to prevent 10 years of unnecessary war .

“ PALE and haggard faces , lank and bony figures ... boys of stunted growth , and others whose long meagre legs would hardly bear their stooping bodies . ”
Charles Dickens 's wrenching accounts of child labour helped to inspire a series of factory laws in 19th - century Britain .
Indeed , by the 1870s factory owners claimed that it was they who were stooping under the burden of regulation .
The new laws required a medical inspector to certify that a child was old enough and strong enough to work .
Unhappy about the cost of these examinations , the manufacturers proposed a cheaper shortcut : a quick measure of a child 's height to establish his age and stamina .
In 1876 Charles Roberts , an inspector , reported the statures of about 10,000 children , drawn from the registers of London military hospitals and his own tallies in Lancashire , Yorkshire and Cheshire .
It was one of the first sophisticated statistical inquiries into the economics of height .
Later scholars have explored the economic determinants of height ( rich people are taller , on average ) , its economic consequences ( tall people are richer , on average ) , and the clues it gives about a society 's standard of living .
But Mr Roberts 's results disappointed the Victorian bosses .
Yes , taller children were older and stronger on average .
But he found eight - year - olds as tall as 13 - year - olds , and boys of ten who weighed twice as much as others the same age .
This distribution was viewed by the 19th - century Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet as God 's “ curve of error ” , as if the tall and the short were deviations from a correctly proportioned “ homme moyen ” , or average man .
The variation meant that you could not use the mean to infer anything about an individual : Mr Roberts could say that the average height of 11 - year - old boys was 52 ½ inches , but not that this boy of 52 ½ inches was 11 .
Nonetheless , manufacturers were right to suspect that taller people , on average , were more employable .
Surprisingly , this remains true in the knowledge economy of today 's America and not just the factory economy of Victorian Britain .
The tallest quarter of the population earns 9 - 10 % more than the shortest quarter , according to two recent studies .
Nicola Persico and Andrew Postlewaite of the University of Pennsylvania and Dan Silverman of the University of Michigan think this is because height gives adolescents self - confidence and helps them learn valuable social skills .
Anne Case and Christina Paxson of Princeton University , on the other hand , argue that people who grow to their full potential are smarter , on average .
Both brains and build depend on the care and nourishment a child receives .
Height adds to income , income also adds to height .
In countries languishing at a real income of $ 4,000 per head ( in 1985 dollars ) , boys average less than 145 cm .
In places that are $ 6,000 a head richer , boys are 4 cm taller , according to calculations by Richard Steckel of Ohio State University .
Likewise , Angus Deaton of Princeton University reports that Indian men of 20 are about 1 cm taller than 40 - year olds , partly because the country was substantially richer when they were born .
In India adults still look up to their parents .
But only figuratively .
The relationship between dollars and inches is not , however , straightforward .
Uganda , for example , is both poorer and taller than India , where almost half of children under five are stunted , according to United Nations figures .
Americans born in the 1880s , as the country 's industrial revolution gathered pace , were both richer and shorter than their forebears .
What explains these enigmas ?
Height rises with prosperity , but at a diminishing rate .
It traces an arc , not a straight line , as income increases .
Otherwise , Mr Steckel points out , Bill Gates would be a giant .
Earning enough to buy plentiful calories and protein makes a big difference to stature .
But once a person has enough money to free himself from thin gruel and hard labour , extra income has less to add .
“ Stature , ” Mr Steckel writes , “ is a good measure of deprivation but not of opulence . ”
Tall men are created equal
This arc has an interesting implication : the stature of society may reflect equality as well as prosperity .
Extra resources add more to poor people 's growth than they add to rich people 's .
So if two societies , with the same income per head , were to line up next to each other , the more egalitarian society should be taller .
This may be one explanation among many for the shrinking America of the 19th century .
Tax records show that wealth gaps widened in America as industrialisation took hold .
From 1820 to 1900 , the Gini coefficient ( a standard measure of inequality ) in Massachusetts rose by 24 % , according to Mr Steckel .
Even as average heights fell , the stature of senior students at Yale and Amherst rose from 171 cm to 173cm .
In India the starkest divisions are sometimes within the household .
Indian women tend to have less clout than their African counterparts .
Their claim on a family 's resources may be weak , even as the demands made on them are heavy .
Many women are consequently underfed or overworked during pregnancy .
Their offspring , especially their daughters , are also undernourished during infancy .
India may be growing taller as it grows richer .
But , Mr Deaton shows , the average height of Indian men is rising three times faster than that of Indian women .
Some Indians deny this enigma , writes Meera Shekar of the World Bank .
If Indians fall short of standard heights , they say , those standards must be an alien imposition , based on foreign populations .
But the genetic differences between populations count for much less than the genetic differences within them .
The grandchildren of American immigrants , for example , reach similar statures , whatever their ancestry .
James
Tanner , a giant among growth scholars , puts it this way : the great variation in human height , he writes , is “ not a curve of God 's errors , but of everyone 's possibilities . ”
The paradox of disappearing European unemployment
Tito Boeri
Unemployment has fallen greatly in Europe during the last decade , yet governments creating millions of jobs are losing elections .
The source of public dissatisfaction is that the price of lower unemployment is greater employment risk .
This column proposes further labour market reforms to address the problem .
An old European dream has come true , but it looks more and more like a nightmare .
The dream was written on the stone of the Treaty , signed in Rome on March 25 , 1957 : “ The Community shall have as its task ( … ) to promote throughout the Community ( … ) a high degree of convergence of economic performance , a high level of employment and of social protection , the raising of the standard of living and quality of life , and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States . ”
A European dream came true …
In the last ten years European unemployment has fallen to a level not seen for over twenty - five years .
There are currently almost 4 million fewer people unemployed in the EU15 than in 1996 .
Long - term unemployment almost halved : Europe is no longer a place where half of all job seekers have been on the dole for more than twelve months , as was the case in the mid-1990s .
The disappearance of mass unemployment in Europe is not the by - product of falling participation to the labour market ; it is the average employment rate in the EU15 that has increased by more than six percent over the last ten years .
This is the only area in which Europe is getting closer to the ambitious Lisbon targets .
Nor there are more discouraged workers crossing the pourous borders between participation and non-participation to the labour market : there was no increase in the number of non-employed persons who decided to stop searching for another job as they realized that there were no vacancies for them .
It was mainly the countries with initially the largest unemployment rates that succeeded in reducing unemployment the most .
The cross-sectional dispersion in unemployment rates across regions of the EU15 ( Nuts II ) also declined considerably as a result of both less cross country and less within country variation in unemployment rates .
This looks like a major step towards achieving the social cohesion pursued by European Governments at least since the 1957 Rome Treaty .
European regions are less and less different in terms of labour market conditions .
.... but it is turning into a nightmare
European Governments , however , are not capitalizing on these labour market success stories .
Governments and coalitions ruling while millions of jobs were created have not been reconfirmed in office .
Berlusconi ’s 2001 - 6 Government succeeded in creating 1.3 million jobs in five years , far more than promised in the 2001 electoral campaign .
This did not prevent the collapse of his popularity and the defeat at the next elections .
Prodi ’s 2006 - 8 Government had a very short life , in spite of creating more than 400,000 jobs in less than 2 years .
Aznar lost in 2004 after halving Spanish unemployment and creating almost 5 million jobs during his mandate .
Public opinion polls also find rising dissatisfaction with working conditions , notably in those countries having experienced the strongest unemployment declines .
Why ?
Why is a European dream turning into a European nightmare ?
The simplest explanation one could possibly offer is that the decline in unemployment was a demographic phenomenon , independent of changes in the incidence of unemployment among specific socio-economic groups .
Europe is experiencing the ageing of its population and young people typically display higher unemployment rates than older workers .
Thus , an ageing Europe is bound to have lower unemployment simply as a result of a changing age distribution of its workforce .
However , this simple explanation does not work .
It could at most explain one - tenth of the decline in unemployment .
The remaining success is due to a fall of unemployment among all age groups .
Nor does large - scale immigration , the second most important demographic phenomenon in Europe in the last decade , explain the disappearance of European mass unemployment .
If anything , more migration should have involved increasing unemployment rates : the incidence of unemployment is typically higher among migrants than natives in the EU15 .
In order to understand what has been going on in Europe and the paradoxical dissatisfaction of its citizens with the disappearance of unemployment , one has to go beyond labour market stocks and look at flows across labour market states .
The first thing to notice is that unemployment has been declining in spite of an increase of unemployment inflows rates ( inflows over the population at risk , that is working age population minus the unemployed ) .
Put it another way , it was mainly an increase in outflows from unemployment that drove the fall in European unemployment .
Secondly , one discovers that there has been an increase in mobility across labour market states , evident from computing mobility indexes over transition matrices mapping flows across the main labour market states .
Significantly , the increase in mobility was stronger in the countries experiencing the largest falls in unemployment .
It was reforms !
The European labour market landscape looks much different from the sclerotic conditions of the early 1990s .
Let us remind what a very influential report commissioned by the G7 , the 1994 OECD Jobs Study stated at that time : “ In inflexible Europe … the high incidence of long - term unemployment is associated with low inflow rates into unemployment . ”
Why did this sea change from sclerotic to a more mobile Europe occur ?
The driving factor of the increase in labour market flows would seem to have been reforms of employment protection legislation .
During the 1990s , major reforms reduced costs of dismissals : there were only four such reforms over the entire EU15 in the 1986 - 90 period and 16 in the 1996 - 2000 period .
Most of these reforms were marginal in that they were confined to reducing employment protection for new hires , expanding the scope of fixed - term contracts and introducing new and more flexible contractual types ( from temporary work agency to job - on - call ) .
This dramatically changed the conditions at entry .
In the countries with the strictest provisions concerning the dismissals of permanent workers , the majority of new hires are currently in these new and highly flexible contracts .
For example , in Spain nine out of ten transitions from unemployment to employment occur in fixed - term contracts .
The increase in unemployment outflows in Europe was largely associated with this new entry channel .
The trouble is that , rather than being just a port of entry , these contracts often become a dead - end : the probability of moving from a fixed - term to permanent contract within a year is indeed very low , of the order of one out of 20 or one out of 10 .
In other words , dual track reforms created long - lasting asymmetries in career paths , concentrating risk on the workers with flexible contracts .
On the basis of transition matrices , it is predicted that , in the long - run , up to one third of employment will be in such flexible contracts .
Can Europeans be happier about their new labour market ?
The dissatisfaction of Europeans with respect to their labour market is ultimately related to a new and apparently less favourable risk - return combination .
Labour markets are becoming more risky and this entails a welfare loss for risk - averse workers unless this greater risk is compensated by higher returns .
Pressures are mounting everywhere in Europe for greater state involvement in wage setting .
These pressures can also be interpreted as a request of compensation for greater labour market risk .
Nobody can be fully insulated from it .
Even the insiders are somewhat exposed as they form expectations about job loss .
The pressures to go back are strong .
But after having reduced state involvement in employment adjustment , it would be a mistake to have governments more involved in wage setting .
Setting statutory and industry - specific wage minima , as recently done in Germany , exposes governments to even stronger pressures from national lobbies and leapfrogging games across industries .
And there is no reason to reintroduce even the mild forms of income policy that were adopted in several EU countries in preparation for EMU membership .
The problem is that centralised wage setting is not an appropriate instrument under the EMU , as macroeconomic shocks are more regional or industry - specific in nature .
Thus , national - union - based systems of industrial relations are ill - suited to address new demands for microeconomic adaptability .
The best response that can be offered to the paradoxical concerns of Europeans with respect to lower unemployment is to decentralise even more wage setting and make it more responsive to productivity .
Risk is magnified by the fact that any labour market transition involves a large wage loss .
Centralized wage agreements tend to reward automatic adjustments of wages to tenure .
Moving across jobs or experiencing even a short unemployment spell prevents moving up the wage ladder .
A better risk - return combination can be offered by linking wages more closely to idiosyncratic productivity .
Insofar as changing jobs involves pairing better matches , wages would increase after changing jobs rather than the other way round .
At the same time , something must be done to tackle the increasing dualism between temporary and permanent jobs in most European labour markets .
This dualism is costly for the society at large as it reduces incentives to accumulate human capital : workers with fixed - term contracts are less subject to on - the - job training than the other workers .
A sensible policy would be to offer a clear “ tenure track ” prospect to young workers by completing reforms of employment protection .
Currently , there is no long - term prospect after the expiration of a temporary contract .
Governments could promote permanent entrance in the permanent labour market in stages , introducing employment protection with gradualism and avoiding the formation of a long - term dual market .
Job security provisions , in the form of mandated severance payments , should increase smoothly as workers acquire tenure without large discontinuities .
Waking up from the nightmare
There is ultimately a trade - off between employment and productivity growth behind the dissatisfaction of Europeans with low unemployment .
Employment growth is occurring at the cost of negative or low growth of labour productivity .
This prevents workers from being compensated for their higher risk exposure .
The fact of the matter is that Europe is still in the middle of the river of labour market reforms .
Pressures to go back are strong .
Governments should resist these pressures , as they would have huge employment costs .
Increasing both employment and productivity in Europe requires doing just the opposite .
Governments should take us on the other side of the river : a tenure track to more stable jobs should be introduced and wage setting should be decentralized to link it more closely to productivity gains .
This just in from the pretty pictures department at NASA .
NASA ’s Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) shows young stars sprouting up in a relatively desolate region of space more than 100,000 light - years from the galaxy ’s bustling center .
This striking image is a composite of ultraviolet data from GALEX and radio data from the Very Large Array in New Mexico , and shows the Southern Pinwheel galaxy , also known simply as M83 .
“ It is absolutely stunning that we find such an enormous number of young stars up to 140,000 light - years away from the center of M83 , ” said Frank Bigiel , lead investigator of the new Galaxy Evolution Explorer observations .
For comparison , the diameter of M83 is only 40,000 light - years across .
M83 is located 15 million light - years away in the southern constellation Hydra .
The ultraviolet image was taken by NASA ’s Galaxy Evolution Explorer between March 15 and May 20 , 2007 .
In this view , the main spiral , or stellar , disk of M83 looks like a pink and blue pinwheel , while its outer arms appear to flap away from the galaxy like giant red streamers .
It is within these so - called extended galaxy arms that , to the surprise of astronomers , new stars are forming .
This side - by - side comparison shows the Southern Pinwheel galaxy , or M83 , as seen in ultraviolet light ( right ) and at both ultraviolet and radio wavelengths ( left ) .
While the radio data highlight the galaxy ’s long , octopus - like arms stretching far beyond its main spiral disk ( red ) , the ultraviolet data reveal clusters of baby stars ( blue ) within the extended arms .
Astronomers speculate that the young stars seen far out in M83 could have formed under conditions resembling those of the early universe , a time when space was not yet enriched with dust and heavier elements .
“ Even with today ’s most powerful telescopes , it is extremely difficult to study the first generation of star formation .
These new observations provide a unique opportunity to study how early generation stars might have formed , ” said co-investigator Mark Seibert of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Pasadena .

Microbes may be responsible for snow — and rain for that matter .
They are certainly involved in much of the man -made snow that ski resorts use to cover for Mother Nature 's winter lapses .
Microorganisms , particularly bacteria , produce proteins in their cell walls that bind water — even if they are dead .
In fact , they bind water in such an orderly fashion that water droplets freezing around a microbe almost mirror the natural lattice formation of ice .
As a result , bacteria can help snow form at warmer temperatures than would otherwise be the case , which explains why some ski resorts add dead microbes to the mix in their snowmaking machines .
And now scientists have discovered such biological precipitation catalysts in natural snows — in such far - flung locations as Montana and Antarctica .
Microbiologist Brent Christner at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and his colleagues collected snow samples from 19 different sites , including Bozeman , Mont. , the French Alps , Ross Island in Antarctica and a glacier in the Yukon 's Wheaton River Valley .
They found microbes in all of the samples , and the highest concentrations in the least remote areas .
In an attempt to gauge whether these microbes were the catalysts of their snowflake vessels , the team exposed them to heat as well as an enzyme found in tears that punctures bacterial cell walls — both of which reduce the ice - forming ability of many microbes .
They then placed the particles in purified water and discovered that they were no longer able to freeze water as effectively at warmer temperatures .
" We would not expect that heat treatment to have any effect on dust particles , " Christner notes .
" It 's good evidence that it 's proteinaceous in origin , that it 's biological . "
Of course , this does not prove that the microbes were actually in the clouds , seeding the snowfall : " Just because we find an ice nucleator in rain or snow does n't mean it originated in a cloud ; it could be scavenged during precipitation , " Christner says .
But other researchers , including microbial ecologist Gary Andersen of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , have found as many as 2,000 varieties of microbes in the air above Texas cities .
" It is clear that they are widely distributed in the atmosphere , " Christner says .
" If they are in the atmosphere , there is no reason they could n't get into clouds . "
Although it remains unclear which microbes may be most responsible for snowfall or rainstorms , one leading candidate is the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae , which infects wheat , corn and other crops .
It is a major pest — and the target of genetic modification — because it causes immediate crop damage if the temperatures drop below freezing .
But it also shows up in clouds with this water - organizing protein on its cell walls — as do fungi , pollen and a host of other biological bits that boast the same property .
" There are a large variety of organisms in nature that have this activity that we just have n't discovered yet , " Christner says .
For example , algae in the ocean can control local weather by releasing a volatile compound that helps promote cloud cover .
That means that Pseudomonas syringae and the other living microbes in the clouds might just be perpetuating themselves — and spreading — when it snows or rains .
What happened to Frank Gehry ?
Some call it a midlife crises , others chalk it up to a moment of revelation .
Whatever occurred , this rather conventional middle - aged architect changed virtually overnight into an avante garde designer and created what is arguably the most influential residence of the 20th Century .
Deconstructivism now pervades the field of architecture and has influenced virtually every contemporary all - star architect in the world .
Gehry is perhaps best known for his curvy , metalic wave - form museums in Bilbao , Seattle , Los Angeles and Minneapolis , but it all started with strange impulses applied to his own traditional little Santa Monica house in the late 1970s .
Frank Gehry ’s house in Santa Monica came before its time as a harbinger of the Deconstructivist movement .
The first recognizedpublic Deconconstructivist architectural project came almost a decade later .
Gehry took his seemingly ordinary house in Santa Monica and began changing things incredibly strange ways .
He took a step beyond the playful reworkings of Postmodern architecture , where traditional design symbols were reinterpreted , and instead starting using materials and strategies few applied to architectural projects .
Gehry started by tearing the drywall off of interior walls to expose structural studs buried in the old house , then subtracted and added architectural elements seemingly without a coherent plan throughout the building .
He added chain link and plywood to the exterior .
His iterative transformations were responses to various impulses and were allowed to coexist without a clear rhyme or reason , flying in the face of both Modernism and Postmodernism – designs from which were typically justified in terms of some kind of central concept .
Since this small house came into being , the idea of deconstructing traditional elements and reassembling them according to obscure and abstract comments has become the norm in the industry , particularly for major public buildings .
Gehry ’s subsequent work ( shown above ) took this to new levels each time .
World architects like Daniel Libeskind , Rem Koolhaas , Peter Eisenman , Zaha Hadid , Coop Himmelblau , and Bernard Tschumi have all created critical works in the subsequent decades that have been influenced by Gehry ’s little house .
There is considerable controversy surrounding his work and the current state of Deconstructivism , though the influence of Gehry ’s approach to design is unquestionably felt throughout the practice of global architecture today .
GENEVA 
The father of a theoretical subatomic particle dubbed " the God particle " says he 's almost sure it will be confirmed in the next year in a race between powerful research equipment in the United States and Europe .
British physicist Peter Higgs , who more than 40 years ago postulated the existence of the particle in the makeup of the atom , said his visit to a new accelerator in Geneva last weekend encouraged him that the Higgs boson will soon be seen .
The $ 2 billion Large Hadron Collider , under construction since 2003 , is expected to start operating by June at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics ( known as CERN ) .
It likely will take several months before the hundreds of scientists from around the world are ready to start smashing together protons to study their composition .
Higgs said Monday the particle may already have been created at the rival Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago , where the Tevatron is currently the world 's most powerful particle accelerator .
" The Tevatron has plenty of energy to do it , " Higgs said .
" It 's just the difficulty of analyzing the data which prevents you from knowing quickly what 's hiding in the data . "
The massive new CERN collider , which has been installed in a 17 - mile circular tunnel under the Swiss - French border , will be more powerful still and will be better able to show what particles are created in the collisions of beams of protons traveling at the speed of light .
The new Geneva collider will re-create the rapidly changing conditions in the universe a split second after the Big Bang .
It will be the closest that scientists have come to the event that they theorize was the beginning of the universe .
They hope the new equipment will enable them to study particles and forces yet unobserved .
But Fermilab still has time to be first if it can show that it has discovered the Higgs boson , Higgs said .
Nobel laureate Leon Lederman has dubbed the theoretical boson " the God particle " because its discovery could unify understanding of particle physics and help humans " know the mind of God . "
Higgs told reporters he is hoping to receive confirmation of his theory by the time he turns 80 in May 2009 .
If not , he added , " I 'll just have to ask my GP to keep me alive a bit longer , " referring to his general practitioner , not the God particle , a term he does not embrace because he fears it might offend some people .
Higgs predicted the existence of the boson while working at the University of Edinburgh to explain how atoms — and the objects they make up — have weight .
Without the particle , the basic physics theory — the " standard model " — lacks a crucial element , because it fails to explain how other subatomic particles — such as quarks and electrons — have mass .
The Higgs theory is that the bosons create a field through which the other particles pass .
The particles that encounter difficulty going through the field as though they are passing through molasses pick up more inertia , and mass .
Those that pass through more easily are lighter .
Higgs said he would be " very , very puzzled " if the particle is never found because he cannot imagine what else could explain how particles get mass .
Higgs said initial reaction to his ideas in the early 1960s was skeptical .
" My colleagues thought I was a bit of an idiot , " he said , noting that his initial paper explaining how his theory worked was rejected by an editor at CERN .
He said a colleague spent the summer at CERN right after he did his work on the theory .
" He came back and said , ' At CERN they did n't see that what you were talking about had much to do with particle physics . '
" I then added on some additional paragraphs and sent it off across the Atlantic to Physical Review Letters , who accepted it .
The mention of what became known as the Higgs - boson was part of the extra which was added on . "

Hey folks , how about we give this pretty little seacoast town of yours a brand - new harbor by detonating several thermonuclear bombs right next door ?
It ’ll all be perfectly safe — sure , maybe a bit of radiation , possibly some fallout , but heck , it wo n’t be as risky to your health as being a little overweight !
If that offer sounds crazy now , it sounded even crazier in 1958 when physicist Edward Teller , who had practically trademarked “ Father of the H - Bomb ” for his own use , went to Alaska to promote “ Project Chariot , ” a plan that would have used Teller ’s explosive children to create a deep - water harbor on the coast of northwestern Alaska .
The locals did n’t want it , and despite government pressure , a well - orchestrated media blitz that had the Alaskan newspapers in Teller ’s pocket , they developed into an organized group that managed to halt the project , though not before biologist Les Viereck lost his university position because he provided data supporting the opposition .
The astonishing story of Project Chariot and how it inadvertantly helpd spark the environmental movement is chronicled in The Firecracker Boys : H-bombs , Inupiat Eskimos , and the Roots of the Environmental Movement , Dan O’Neill ’s overlooked 1994 classic , recently reissued in paperback .
PD Smith , a new hand at the great site 3 Quarks Daily , offers some highlights :
Locals said they did n’t need a harbour .
They also raised understandable concerns about radioactivity .
After all , the year before , Nevil Shute had published On the Beach , one of the best - selling of all nuclear fictions ( four million copies by 1980 ) , in which the world dies a lingering death caused by fallout from a nuclear war fought with cobalt bombs .
Teller was unfazed by the criticisms .
That year he had defended atmospheric nuclear tests , claiming such fallout was no more dangerous than “ being an ounce overweight ” .
He tried to reassure the Alaskans : “ We have learned to use these powers with safety ” .
He even promised them a harbour in the shape of a polar bear .
Teller and his fellow scientists at the Livermore Laboratory in California were on a mission to redeem the nuclear bomb .
They wanted to overcome the public ’s irrational “ phobic ” reactions to nuclear weapons .
“ Geographical engineering ” was the answer , said Teller : “ We will change the earth ’s surface to suit us . ”
The Faustian hubris of the man appeared to know no bounds .
Dubbed in the press “ Mr H - Bomb ” , Teller even admitted to a “ temptation to shoot at the moon ” with nukes .
You need a new Suez Canal ?
Blast it out with my thermonuclear bombs .
Or how about turning the Mediterranean into a freshwater lake to irrigate the Sahara ?
All you need to do is to close the Straits of Gibraltar by detonating a few H - bombs ( clean ones , of course , absolutely guaranteed ) .
No problem .
We can do it – trust me , I ’m a physicist .
Dan O’Neill interviewed Teller .
Or at least he tried to .
As soon as he started asking questions , Teller “ cursed loudly and with great facility ” and tore up the release form he had just signed to allow O’Neill to use the interview .
Despite Teller ’s hissy fit , O’Neill ’s remarkable book shows how government agencies lied to local people , attempted to bribe scientists with promises of research funding , and manipulated the Alaskan media , which demonstrated “ more sycophancy than scrutiny ” .
But a grass - roots movement of local Alaskans – Eskimo whale hunters , bush pilots , church ladies , and log -cabin conservationists – joined forces with a few principled scientists to successfully oppose America ’s nuclear establishment , and in so doing sowed the seeds of modern environmentalism .
Teller , of course , went on to inspire the title charatcer of Dr. Strangelove and promote the Strategic Defense Initiative , that multi-billion - dollar money sink launched during the Reagan administration and still with us today .
It ’s wonderful to have O’Neill ’s book back in print .
It ’s an exciting , powerful story , told in a way that combines the grace of John McPhee with the two - fisted zeal of Robert Caro .

About the author
( NewsTarget )
There seems to be more evidence mounting in the ongoing Perflurooctanoic Acid ( PFOA ) debate .
PFOA is used in the production of Teflon and other non-stick surfaces and is found in the packaging of candy bars , microwave popcorn , fast food packaging like french fry and pizza boxes , bakery items , drinks , paper plates , and a host of " stain resistant " products such as carpets .
Other well - known brand names containing PFOA include Stainmaster , Scotchgard , SilverStone , Fluron , Supra , Excalibur , Greblon , Xylon , Duracote , Resistal , Autograph and T - Fal .
Although the DuPont Corporation has stated that PFOA is only used in the manufacturing process and should not be found in the final products , it must be noted that the chemical is found in the bloodstream of 95 % of American men , women , and children .
It seems that no one is quite certain how the chemical residue has made it into the bloodstream of such a large number of people if it is not located in the final product .
Research has shown that PFOA was still present in the blood for approximately four years after exposure and levels were only reduced by half .
It has been implicated by some research to cause increased instances of cancer in the pancreas , liver , testicles , and mammary glands .
Also increased were instances of miscarriage , weight loss , thyroid problems , weaker immune systems , and low organ weights .
There is a growing community of scientists including a research team at the University of Toronto that believe the largest concentration of PFOA is not the manufacturing process of Teflon , but a cousin of Teflon called " telomers .
" Telomers are also made by DuPont and a select few other companies .
These telomers are used to make the stain and grease repellent coatings for fast food containers , apparel , and carpeting .
In a study conducted at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , there appears to be a correlation between PFOA and low birth weight in newborns .
ABC news network reported in February of 2007 that the researchers tested the blood of 300 newborn infants and examined their levels of exposure to PFOA and " other fluorinated chemicals in relation to their birth weight , head circumference and other developmental markers .
" One of the head researchers in the independent study , Dr. Lynn Goldman said , " It appears that there is a relation between a higher level of exposure and lower birth weight , as well as the circumference of the head . "
Dr. Goldman described the decreases in the over all size of the children as , " very small .
" With looming legal action and numerous law suits currently pending against the DuPont Company , if these findings are proven accurate , the results could have a major influence on the outcome of the court cases .
It could also bring about regulation from the Federal government where there had previously been none .
In addition , the Environmental Working Group has reported that PFOA has been " found in wildlife from Italy , the US , Japan , Russia , Belgium , and Canada , and in places as remote as the Sand Island Wildlife Refuge in Midway Atoll . "
They also report that scientists have found PFOA " in the egg yolks of double crested cormorant from Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba Canada ; in the blood of Russian Caspian seals ; and in a short - snouted spinner dolphin off the coast of Florida . " ( http://www.ewg.org/node/21749
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Morgantown , West Virginia , under the direction of John Meade , have completed a study that showed PFOA priming immune system response and causing an overreaction to allergens in mice .
In the study , mice were given PFOA before exposure to an egg allergen .
The mice produced more " allergen - specific antibodies and experienced more constriction of their airways than those exposed to the allergen alone . " ( http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg...
A science director at DuPont , Robert Rickard has said that he did not believe that PFOA was likely to be a cause of allergy - related health issues in humans ; but to date , there have been no studies to examine this possibility .
The EPA has urged DuPont to eliminate this toxin from their manufacturing process but even as late as mid 2007 , the elimination of PFOA has been strictly voluntary .
DuPont claims to have already reduced PFOA emissions from manufacturing plants 97 % but have never made a commitment to discontinue the use of the chemical altogether .
PFOA is not regulated .
Any restrictions on the use of the substance has resulted from court settlements without intervention by US regulatory committees .
At this time no permits are required from the EPA or state departments .
DuPont has said that it would handle its own monitoring and provide reports with the results .
The EPA has already identified PFOA as a " likely " human carcinogen .
DuPont maintains , regardless of the studies or research done , that the substance is not related to any adverse health effects and that all exposure and levels in humans fall within " normal range . "
The fundamental question remains :
Is any amount of PFOA in the body " normal " ?
Most of the items that are in direct contact with non-stick coating like those mentioned above are not healthy for the body to consume .
If at all possible , avoid french fries , candy bars , pizza , and microwave popcorn where Teflon is commonly used .
Vacuuming any carpeting with the " stain - resistant " claim releases the chemical into the air to be circulated in your home .
There are alternatives to using Teflon and other non-stick cookware .
Heating non-stick cookware to broiling temperatures or above 350 degrees F , releases the PFOA into the air and according to some naturopaths , into your food especially if there is a scratch in your non -stick cookware .
Alternative food storage and cooking source suggestions include glassware , stoneware , and enamel coated cast iron .
The realization that a potentially hazardous chemical is in numerous products that individuals and families come into contact with daily , may seem daunting .
While the DuPont Company remains passive regarding any research findings regarding PFOA , those who are skeptical about its safety seem to find more vindication with the publication of every study .
If independent research continues to show consistently negative effects of PFOA , DuPont 's legal team may need more than a little Teflon from their science division to get them out of an ever increasing " sticky " situation .

Any data recovery starts with a scan .
Should you do Linux RAID recovery or a regular file recovery , the first step is to see if your data is still there and can be recovered without taking your device to a lab .
Once you can see your data after running Disk Drill 's unified recovery or choosing a specific undelete algorithm , you will usually verify that the data is still recoverable by running a preview of the files listed by Disk Drill .
If you already own Disk Drill PRO , you will have a simpler option to directly mount all scanning results as a separate disk .
This will give you a bit more freedom of running your verifications in a familiar Finder window , and managing your recoverable items as if they were just regular files on your hard drive .
Once you select the files you need to be recovered , hit the final Recover button , confirm the destination , and give it a few minutes to complete the recovery and reconstruction of your Linux data .
After struggling with soaring heating costs through the winter , millions of Americans are behind on electric and gas bills , and a record number of families could face energy shut - offs over the next two months , according to state energy officials and utilities around the country .
The escalating costs of heating oil , propane and kerosene , most commonly used in the Northeast , have posed the greatest burdens , officials say , but natural gas and electricity prices have also climbed at a time when low - end incomes are stagnant and prices have also jumped for food and gasoline .
In New Hampshire , applicants for fuel subsidies under the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program received an average of $ 600 in a one - time grant and up to $ 975 for the extremely poor who rely on heating oil or propane , the costliest fuels .
But those grants , which in recent years have covered 60 percent of heating costs , covered only about 35 percent of those costs this winter , said Celeste Lovett , director of the state ’s energy aid program .
The state will have given aid to about 34,500 people by the end of April , Ms. Lovett said , a 5 percent increase over last year and the highest number ever .
The most immediate challenge is to help the high number of consumers who are far behind in electric and gas payments , said Mark Wolfe , director of the National Energy Assistance Directors ’ Association , which represents state aid officials in Washington .
The U.S.A. : The Third World 's First Superpower ( April 16 , 2008 )
Readers Journal has been updated .
Check out 15 fascinating thought - provoking new comments and a new essay , On Capital Traps .
To those of you currently ensconsed in quiet , comfortable suburban America , the notion that the U.S. shares a number of disturbing traits with Third World countries might seem implausible or even insulting .
But please read on before passing judgment .
Here are some key traits the U.S. shares with Third World nations -- trends which are only growing more visible with each passing month : 1 . Income and wealth inequality .
One of the defining characteristics of Third World countries is extremes of income and wealth ; a relative handful of families / elites control most of the property , wealth and " means of production " ( wealth generating assets ) while the majority of citizens own and earn essentially nothing .
Here in the U.S. it 's not that visibly extreme , but facts are facts : a relative handful own the vast majority of key wealth - producing assets :
The Growing Gap in the United States Between the Rich and the Rest There is also another measure called the Gini coefficient .
It measures the concentration of wealth at different percentile levels , and does an overall computation .
It is an index that goes from zero to one , one being the most unequal .
Wealth inequality in the United States has a Gini coefficient of .82 , which is pretty close to the maximum level of inequality you can have .
A household in the middle — the median household — has wealth of about $ 62,000 .
$ 62,000 is not insignificant , but if you consider that the top 1 percent of households ’ average wealth is $ 12.5 million , you can see what a difference there is in the distribution .
Things are even more concentrated if you exclude owner - occupied housing .
It is nice to own a house and it provides all kinds of benefits , but it is not very liquid .
You ca n’t really dispose of it , because you need some place to live .
The top 1 percent of families hold half of all non -home wealth .
The middle class ’s major assets are their home , liquid assets like checking and savings accounts , CDs and money market funds , and pension accounts .
For the average family , these assets make up 84 percent of their total wealth .
The richest 10 percent of families own about 85 percent of all outstanding stocks .
They own about 85 percent of all financial securities , 90 percent of all business assets .
These financial assets and business equity are even more concentrated than total wealth .
We are much more unequal than any other advanced industrial country .
Perhaps our closest rival in terms of inequality is Great Britain .
But where the top 1 % percent in this country own 38 percent of all wealth , in Great Britain it is more like 22 or 23 percent .
What is remarkable is that this was not always the case .
Up until the early 1970s , the U.S. actually had lower wealth inequality than Great Britain , and even than a country like Sweden .
But things have really turned around over the last 25 or 30 years .
In fact , a lot of countries have experienced lessening wealth inequality over time .
The U.S. is atypical in that inequality has risen so sharply over the last 25 or 30 years .
For more , please see : Wealth , Income , and Power by G. William Domhoff Growing Wealth , Inequality , and Housing in the United States ( Joint Center for Housing Studies , Harvard University , 29 pages )
So what separates the U.S. from elite - owned Third World nations ?
Rather like the young lady who agrees to an evening with a wealthy stranger for $ 1 million , we 've already established the inequality ; the rest is mere haggling over the details .
2 . The gutting of public services to pay burdensome interest on massive public debt .
In the Third World , this process has been given an innocuous - sounding name by its enforcers , the World Bank and the IMF ( International Monentary Fund ) : Structural Adjustment Program ( SAP ) .
The world 's bankers have long found it highly profitable to lend vast sums of " easy money " to Third World dictators , elites and kleptocrats , and then have their governments go in and forceably collect the interest when the overburdened borrowers defaulted .
In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt warned the European Powers not to land forces on Santo Domingo when it defaulted on its debts ; instead , he sent U.S. forces to the customhouse to collect tariffs in order to pay the aggrieved European creditors .
In the current version of the game , the World Bank and the IMF require the debtor nations to agree to a Structural Adjustment Program , which slashes public spending in favor of interest payments to the western lenders .
The U.S. Federal government has no limit on what it can borrow except the willingness of fools - - oops I mean creditors -- to keep lending it more money via buying its Treasury bonds .
But even with no limits on borrowing , the cost of the interest will soon squeeze Federal Spending .
The interest on the Federal Debt is poised to exceed the cost of Medicare or even the Pentagon / Defense : $ 429 Billion according to the U.S. Treasury .
Here 's a good chart of annual Federal expenses .
Unlike the Federal government , states , counties and cities cannot borrow unlimited amounts of money to fund their budget deficits .
But states and various agencies have worked around this annoying limitation on their spending by selling " municipal bonds " which were theoretically designed to fund multi-year infrasructure projects .
But in many cases , these have ended up funding expenses that have nothing to do with buildings , and of course the interest on this debt grows along with every new bond issued .
And in California , that 's billions more each and every year .
As recession slashes tax revenues at all levels of government , the interest on the stupendous public debts will eat up an ever - larger percentage of the public budgets , forcing cuts in payrolls and services -- such as filling potholes and keeping libraries open .
Welcome to the Structural Adjustment Program for the U.S.A .
The Third World experienced massive declines in public welfare and infrastructure spending in the 1980s -- now we will get a taste of the debt - induced belt - tightening ourselves .
3 . The gutting of public services as public employee elites rally round their salaries , benefits and fiefdoms .
One of the distinctions of a Third World economy is the extremely high premium placed on securing a government bureaucracy position , as these are essentially the only secure jobs in the entire country .
As the SAP slashes spending to pay the ever - increasing interest on debt , the public employee elites fight tooth and nail to maintain their perquisites , sacrificing public services to keep their security and benefits intact despite massive cuts in tax revenues .
You will soon see libraries and fire stations closed , public health and recreation programs cut , etc. -- but magically , the upper - echelon public payrolls will not decline .
Frequent contributor Michael Goodfellow sent in this article about fire battalion chiefs earning $ 270,000 a year in Silicon Valley - - far more than the mayor .
Who is San Jose 's highest - paid employee ?
You may be surprised : San Jose 's highest - paid employee last year was n't the city 's top manager , lawyer or doctor .
The mayor and city council ?
Not even close .
The highest - paid worker was a fire battalion chief .
Ivan Lee earned a total of $ 270,367 , including $ 125,195 in base pay , an eye - popping $ 108,116 in overtime and $ 37,055 in other cash compensation , such as back pay from a labor contract settlement .
Three other battalion chiefs were among the city 's 10 highest - paid workers in 2007 , with total cash compensation - excluding benefits - of up to $ 244,847 .
The latest figures , requested by the Mercury News , come amid a heated City Hall debate over employee pay and benefits .
Personnel costs account for two - thirds of the city 's operating budget , which has been plagued by multimillion - dollar deficits .
And salaries have grown 38 percent since 2000 , almost twice the cost of living increase reflected in the consumer price index .
Mayor Chuck Reed has called for smaller raises , angering city unions .
Of San Jose 's nearly 7,000 full - time workers , nearly a third earned more than $ 100,000 last year , and 37 made more than $ 200,000 - nearly double the number in 2006 .
The average city worker 's base pay is $ 82,328 - almost twice Santa Clara County 's 2006 median individual income of $ 47,283 , the most recent figures available .
This reads just like a Third World country , where the bureaucrats get twice the pay and immeasurably more pension and healthcare benefits than the average private worker .
4 . Secure " formal " jobs are replaced with insecure " informal " jobs .
You know the drill : fire all your salaried workers in a downsizing , then hire back the best as contract workers without benefits or pensions .
With secure permanent positions as rare as gold statues , laid - off workers take part - time jobs , or reluctantly enter the " informal " job market as handymen , babysitters , etc .
On a societal - wide basis , this means the destruction of tens of millions of once - secure or relatively secure jobs , which are then replaced with completely insecure , informal jobs with no pension or healthcare protections / benefits .
Again , this is a primary characteristic of a Third World economy .
5 . As the economy falters , a vast prison - state / gulag acts to control petty criminals and provide patronage - rich public - worker positions .
Sell a gram of cocaine , go to jail for 25 years .
The prison guards union is one of the most powerful and feared lobbying organizations in the state of California , surpassing even the mighty Teachers Union and trial lawyers for political power .
More prisons ?
You can bet we need them ....
6 . As secure , decent - paying jobs vanish , the working poor turn to the Military for secure jobs with benefits .
Over one million Americans have served " in theatre " in Iraq , and despite the grueling war there , the Armed Forces have met their recruitment goals in every category but retention of mid-rank officers -- chief petty officers , lieutenants and captains ( Army and Marines ) .
Where else can you nail down $ 50,000 - $ 60,000 in benefits and earn cash re-enlistment bonuses ?
And in 20 years , you 'll have earned a bulletproof pension and Veterans Administration benefits -- oh , and if you have n't noticed , the VA is now the best - run large - scale medical services organization in the U.S.
( That is not to say there have n't been hellish stories from wounded Iraq - War vets ; but some of these problems stem from the tangled , snafu - ridden " hand - off " of the wounded from active - duty U.S. Military facilities to long - term VA care . )
7 . Top - level public education is increasingly expensive and thus increasingly out of reach for average citizens 's offspring .
Since when did students have to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to attend public universities ?
It 's time to overhaul Prop. 13 to save state : University of California students now contribute $ 1 for every $ 2 the state chips in - in the mid-'60s , that ratio was 1 to 19 .
When I was at Cal in the late 1960s , student loans were almost nonexistent , but now the average annual cost of attending UC is nearly $ 24,000 a year , and half the students have to take out loans to graduate .
It 's hard to believe now , but in the pre-Prop.
13 era , public support for higher education was taken as a given - not just in the flush 1960s , but in much leaner times .
In 1933 , when California Gov. James Rolph proposed cutting UC 's budget , the UC Regents protested that he was breaking faith with the people , and UC President Robert Gordon Sproul responded with words that have a tragic relevance today : " When a state prunes too severely the intellectual life at the top , it produces increasing poverty and despair at the bottom . "
From 1/19 to 1/2-- that 's quite a shifting of costs from taxpayers to students .
This too is Third World , where even public education costs more than most people can pay without going deep into debt .
Put this all together and what do you have ?
A nation which clearly shares key characteristics with oft - maligned Third World " basketcase " nations which are wallowing in debt , unfilled potholes , overflowing prisons and declining public - sector services .
Does that mean the U.S. is a Third World state ?
Of course not ; but the above trends should raise our collective awareness of the risks ahead .

McCain stated that it is immaterial whether al - Qaeda was Iraq before the invasion or not .
“ Those who claim we should withdraw from Iraq in order to fight Al Qaeda more effectively elsewhere are making a dangerous mistake .
Whether they were there before is immaterial , al Qaeda is in Iraq now , as it is in the borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan , in Somalia , and in Indonesia .
If we withdraw prematurely from Iraq , al Qaeda in Iraq will survive , proclaim victory and continue to provoke sectarian tensions that , while they have been subdued by the success of the surge , still exist , as various factions of Sunni and Shi’a have yet to move beyond their ancient hatreds , and are ripe for provocation by al Qaeda . ”
John McCain fails to understand that if there was no al - Qaeda in Iraq before the U.S. invaded , then there is absolutely no justification for being there .
McCain might think that it does n’t matter because al - Qaeda is there now , but this is a lie of omission at best .
What supporters of this war do n’t tell you is that estimates of the number of al - Qaeda in Iraq are around 1,000 .
The insurgents killing Americans are Iraqis .
