The more we learn about the human genome , the less DNA looks like destiny .
As scientists discover more about the " epigenome , " a layer of biochemical reactions that turns genes on and off , they 're finding that it plays a big part in health and heredity .
By mapping the epigenome and linking it with genomic and health information , scientists believe they can develop better ways to predict , diagnose and treat disease .
" A new world is opening up , one that is so much more complex than the genomic world , " said Moshe Szyf , an epigeneticist at Canada 's McGill University .
The epigenome can change according to an individual 's environment , and is passed from generation to generation .
It 's part of the reason why " identical " twins can be so different , and it's also why not only the children but the grandchildren of women who suffered malnutrition during pregnancy are likely to weigh less at birth .
" Now we 're even talking about how to see if socioeconomic status has an impact on the epigenome , " Szyf said .
Researchers have already linked some human cancers with epigenetic changes .
In a few years , scientists hope that doctors , by looking at an individual 's epigenome , will be able to detect cancer early and determine what treatments to use .
The same might be done for other diseases – and as the effect of the environment on epigenetic change is better understood , people will be able to address the environmental aspects of health .
The field , though still embryonic , wo n't be that way for long .
" Epigenetics is one of the fastest - moving areas of science , period , " said Melanie Ehrlich , a Tulane University epigeneticist whose lab linked human cancer to epigenomic changes in 1983 .
Back then , Ehrlich 's discipline was largely ignored .
Walter Gilbert , a Nobel Prize - winning biologist , famously said that since fruit flies had no epigenomes , people could hardly need them .
But in the past two decades – and especially the last couple of years – studies have linked the epigenome to disease and development , showing that it changes in response to the environment and can be passed from parents to children .
While predicted treatments run from diabetes and heart disease to substance abuse and schizophrenia , the most promising applications are in cancer .
Research shows that some cancers follow from the deactivation of tumor - suppression genes .
Last year , the Food and Drug Administration approved the first epigenetic drug , azacitidine , which treats a form of leukemia by reactivating those genes .
However , using drugs to target specific parts of the epigenome , which runs in tandem with our 6 billion base pairs of DNA , is extremely complicated .
Ehrlich believes epigenetic researchers are better off trying to predict and diagnose cancer and other diseases .
To do that , scientists need a large - scale map that shows how epigenetic patterns relate to disease , said Steve Baylin , an epigeneticist at Johns Hopkins .
" If we knew those patterns , " Baylin said , " you could predict which individuals are more at risk – change their diets , change their exposures , use prevention .
We could detect disease early and predict how people respond to drugs . "
Making that map wo n't be easy .
Not only does the epigenome change over time , it also differs in every major cell type , of which there are a couple hundred .
Epigeneticists say this will be time - consuming but possible .
In Europe , a consortium of public and private institutions is collaborating on the Human Epigenome Project , while mapping in the United States is scattered among a handful of companies and government - funded scientists .
" We do n't have the funding to do a comprehensive , large - scale epigenetics project , " said Elise Feingold , a director of the National Human Genome Research Institute 's ENCODE Project .
The lack of investment is somewhat reminiscent of the Human Genome Project 's early struggles , when James Watson fought for government money .
But at least the epigenomic mapping effort seems to have learned something from the gene - patenting frenzy that loomed over the Human Genome Project .
" That was a lesson in how intellectual property should not be handled , " said John Stamatoyannopoulos , founder of biopharmaceutical company Regulome .
" Everybody patented everything left and right , the lawyers got rich , the patent office was flooded , and at the end of the day the patents just were n't valuable . "
The absence of patent sniping might diminish some of the urgency , but the upside is that the epigenomic map is free and available to anyone – although only a tiny fraction has thus far been made .
" We are well under 1 percent finished ; 1 percent would be a massive overstatement , " Stamatoyannopoulos said .
" But , ultimately , this type of knowledge will revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat disease . "

It was someone 's responsibility to keep a 13 - year - old girl from lying about her age on MySpace and meeting a 19 - year - old man who allegedly sexually assaulted her in a Texas parking lot .
But according to a judge 's pivotal ruling on Wednesday , it was n't MySpace's .
According to a report in the Los Angeles Times , the ruling by Judge Sam Sparks in the U.S. District Court in Austin , Texas , appears to be the first time a federal court has extended the same broad free - speech protection rights granted to Internet service providers to a social - networking site .
" If anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe , " Sparks wrote of the unnamed alleged victim , " It was her parents , not MySpace . "
Sparks ' ruling dismissed the case , adding that MySpace could n't be held liable for the actions of its users any more than Yahoo !
was responsible for what people write on its message boards , and that the most popular social - networking site should n't be punished for the failure of its voluntary safety measures .
If you punish MySpace for that , he said , Internet firms would stop taking such steps to protect users .
The ruling stemmed from a case in which a 19 - year - old man was charged with sexual assault last summer in connection with the Doe case .
The girl 's parents sued MySpace parent company News Corp. for $ 30 million , saying the site did n't do enough to protect its members ; at least four similar cases are pending ( see " Teen Sues MySpace For $ 30 Million Over Sexual Assault Claim " ) .
According to court documents , the girl listed her age as 18 when she joined MySpace , and at the time she was 14 exchanged e-mails and phone calls with college freshman Pete Solis , who allegedly sexually assaulted her in a parking lot after the two had gone to dinner and a movie .
" A lot of people are angry about what kids are doing and what 's happening on the Internet , " Parry Aftab , a leading Internet child - safety expert told the Times .
" That 's fine .
But it is not MySpace 's role to raise your child . "
Since acquiring MySpace in July 2005 , News Corp. has instituted a series of security measures to fight the image of a place where unsavory characters lurk around , including the hiring of a chief safety officer , public - service announcements on the site and TV that warn children to be cautious of strangers online as well as the recent roll - out of parental control software and restrictions on interactions between adults and teens ( see " MySpace Restricting Adults ' Access To Teen Users " ) .
" We applaud the judge 's decision to dismiss the plaintiffs ' claims of negligence , fraud and misrepresentation against MySpace , " a spokesperson for the site said in a statement to MTV News .
" This decision reaffirms that under federal law Internet sites like MySpace cannot be held liable for content posted by , or wrongdoing committed by , individuals who visit our site .
MySpace has always been concerned about what happened to Julie Doe because we take the safety and security of our community very seriously .
However , a lawsuit against MySpace was not the appropriate way to redress any harm to her . "
Sparks relied on the 1996 Communications Decency Act in reaching his verdict , applying Congress ' assertion that Internet service providers should not be held liable for content posted on their sites by third parties .
An expert told the Times that since the passage of the 1996 Act , courts have interpreted the immunity from prosecution for ISPs pretty broadly , realizing that if ISPs become responsible for the editorial content of anyone who participates in an online chat , it would be virtually impossible to host a site .
If you ’re an experienced entrepreneur who ’s had venture funding , skip these posts .
If you ’re a VC , please read on and tell me if I got anything wrong but remember that I ’m writing from an entrepreneur ’s point of view .
If you ’re an entrepreneur who has n’t had VC funding – even a wannabe entrepreneur – read on .
These posts are for you .
BTW , if you ’re thinking of investing in a VC fund , you ’re welcome to read on but you are going to sign a bunch of papers before you invest saying that you are an experienced investor and , by implication at least , understand all of this .
But you may enjoy ( or be horrified by ) an entrepreneur ’s POV .
You already know that venture capitalists were invented to supply entrepreneurs with the money we need to make dreams happen .
You probably also know that they wo n’t provide any of that money unless they think your dream has the potential to become a hard reality which returns TO THEM many times their initial investment and unless they believe you are a dreamer who can execute .
But it ’s also important to know where they get that money which you need to have them pass on to you and how they actually get compensated .
You should always understand the needs , motivations , and constraints of the people that you negotiate with .
Moreover , the VCs who supply you with money will become a part of your very full start - up life .
Some venture capitalists ( rich ex-entrepreneurs , for example ) simply manage their own money or family money .
Other venture capitalists are hired by a single very rich individual to manage a venture fund for the individual .
A third type of venture fund manages the venture investments for a company like Intel or Cisco or Microsoft .
What these three types of fund have in common is that they DON ’T have to spend time raising the money they are gonna pass on to you .
They already have it .
In theory , this leaves them free to spend all their time on their investments .
The most common type of venture fund DOES have to raise money – in some senses it is an entrepreneurial enterprise itself .
A VC firm ( not the same thing as a fund ) is the GENERAL partner of the fund .
The bulk of the money in the fund , however , comes from the LIMITED partners – they are the actual investors .
When a new VC firm sets up shop , it has to spend a huge amount of its time recruiting these limited partners and selling partnership units to them .
Although a VC firm may talk to you about your dream before they have actually closed their own funding , it is unlikely they will be able to give you the money until they get it themselves ( sometimes the general partners have contributed enough capital for some starting investments ) .
You certainly want to know whether the firm you are talking to is actually in a position to invest or whether the money you need is contingent on their closing their funding .
Ed Jordan , my CFO at ITXC had an excellent way of judging VCs : “ would you give them your money to invest ? ” he always asked me after a meeting .
If the answer is no , run – do n’t walk – away from the potential deal .
Trust Ed ( and me ) on this : you do n’t want to be stuck with dumb or incompetent VCs .
As part of your evaluation of a VC firm – if it is one of those firms which raises money from limited partners , ask to see the material they give to their potential investors .
For liability reasons they are careful with their claims here so these are somewhat hype - free .
You will also find out from this material exactly how the VC firm is compensated .
Guess what ; that drives behavior .
Usually VC firms raise funds of $ 100 million or more .
This lower limit is both because there are many fixed costs including outrageous legal bills associated with fund raising and because the compensation of the VC firm which is the general partner is usually contingent both on the size of the fund as well as its results .
In the early days of a fund , there are no results so the VCs have to live on their percentage .
A $ 100 million dollar fund is actually a fund whose limited partners have committed to supply a $ 100 million dollars .
This does n’t mean that they have actually written checks which add up to this amount .
The limited partners know that the venture firm – the general partner - wo n’t be able to invest $ 100 million all at once and these limited partners do n’t want their money sitting in a VC fund bank account earning small returns .
What actually happens is that the fund makes capital calls – requires the limited investors to cough up part of their committed money – when the fund actually has a use for the cash – giving it to you , for example , or paying management fees .
Remember that there is a difference between a VC FIRM and the FUND ( S ) it raises and manages .
This is important and it ’ll be on the test .
A VC firm may raise and run several funds .
The fund may outlive the firm or vice versa .
In almost all ways , the performance of one fund run by a particular VC firm is isolated from the performance of other funds run by that same firm .
For example , funds that put money to work in 1998 generally had great performance when the money came cascading back from IPOs .
Funds sponsored by the same VC firms which invested in late 1999 and 2000 did terribly because the entrepreneurs could command huge premiums to customary valuations and NASDAQ ( and most of the companies ) crashed before there was any return on the outsized investments .
Which type of fund do you want to get your money from ?
Ca n’t answer because the quality of the individuals you deal with is what matters most .
So I ’ll give you major plus and minus on each .
Ex-entrepreneur running her own money :
Plus – does n’t have to worry about being second - guessed by a boss or investors so can afford to be innovative and patient .
Minus – ca n’t forget she was an entrepreneur so thinks she can do your job better than you can .
Hired hand running a rich person ’s money :
Plus - does n’t have to worry about fund - raising or communication with a limited partner community .
Minus – tends to be so mortally afraid of offending the single investor or not following a “ vision ” that he does n’t quite understand and so can be an investment coward .
Company venture arm :
Plus – may be able to get you a preference when dealing with the sponsoring company since it is presumably interested in whatever you ’re developing and has a strategic as well as financial stake in your success
Minus – the people in the company venture arms are usually not experienced investors , may be fresh out of business school .
Do n’t make policy and may not understand it .
Big company politics can be in your way .
“ Public ” venture fund with limited partners :
Plus – the actual VCs in the VC firm have to have a pretty good track record – at least some of them – or they ca n’t raise the money to begin with .
The partner you deal with will usually be able to make decisions on his or her own .
Minus – can be distracted either by a high management fee which is independent of performance ( other than raising money ) or by earning the praise or avoiding the complaints of the limited partners or raising yet another fund .
These firms all find raising money easier at the same time so there is either a flood or dearth of money from them .
From an entrepreneur ’s point of view , a flood of money is great until you get yours .
Then you ’d just as soon that a pack of imitators do n’t get funded on terms even more favorable than yours .
If you want to learn how venture capital works from the POV of venture capitalists – and in much more detail than I ’ll explain it , you ca n’t do better than go to the blogs of Fred Wilson and Brad Feld .
They are both very smart and successful VCs AND are very readable and prolific communicators .
You ALWAYS want to read the blog of a VC who may fund you – if he or she does n’t have a blog and you ’re in the web / tech space … hmmm .

The Pelamis has already been exported to Portugal
The Pelamis device has been tested at the European Marine Energy Centre ( Emec ) on Orkney by Leith - based company Ocean Power Delivery .
Scottish Power wants to commission four more at the same site .
Deputy First Minister Nicol Stephen announced a £ 13 m funding package that will also allow a number of other marine energy devices to be tested .
Ocean Power Delivery has already exported the Pelamis for use in a commercial wave farm .
The large , tubular segments were taken to a site off the northern coast of Portugal last year for a project which aimed to generate enough power for 1,500 households .
At that stage the company warned that the industry could be forced to quit Scotland if there were no opportunities to use the technology closer to home .
Scotland has the potential to generate a quarter of Europe 's marine energy
Nicol Stephen
Deputy first minister
Now Scottish
Power is planning a venture which it believes could create enough power for 2,000 homes .
The biggest single handout of more than £ 4 m will go to a Scottish Power subsidiary , CRE Energy , which will build the wave farm .
Mr Stephen said : " Today marks a vital milestone in Scotland 's drive to be the world leader in the development of marine renewables . "
Create jobs
Of the Pelamis scheme , he said : " This will be the world 's biggest commercial wave project - significantly bigger than the major Portuguese scheme .
" Scotland has the potential to generate a quarter of Europe 's marine energy and kick - starting the sector is vital if we are to create a significant industry based in Scotland and meet our long - term renewables targets . "
Mr Stephen said the industry had the potential to create thousands of jobs and attract millions of pounds of investment .
Scottish Power 's director of renewables , Keith Anderson , said : " This is a massive step forward .
" It will be a test of the actual devices that will be used commercially and , if successful , should help propel Scotland into the forefront of marine energy throughout the world . "
' Emerging economies '
Emec managing director Neil Kermode said : " We are delighted to see this level of support from the Scottish Executive .
" It sends a clear signal that the executive is determined to push forward the development of tidal and wave technologies - technologies that will unlock the enormous renewable energy potential of our coastal waters .
Mr Stephen said it was an exciting development for Scotland
" The technology is moving forward , but we must never underestimate just how difficult - and expensive - an environment this is to work in . "
Friends of the Earth Scotland 's chief executive , Duncan McLaren , said : " Wave and tidal power could supply a fifth of UK's electricity needs and Scotland is ideally placed to generate significant amounts of this pollution - free energy .
" It is critical that we see full - scale devices in our waters soon , otherwise the world - leading expertise Scotland has built up will rapidly depart these shores . "
Green speaker on energy , Shiona Baird MSP , said : " Any investment is to be welcomed - but it pales into insignificance with the Portuguese project .
" Despite the gusto with which this announcement is being made , ministers remain determined to build more roads and expand airports , so it 's going to take a lot more than this to reduce climate pollution . "
Actual conversation .
DSL has been off for over 12 hours and that ’s about my limit .
There ’s only so long I can do without a fresh set of bits , so I break down and do my third least favorite thing to do … call customer support .
Customer support frustrates me because of the well - designed ability to do nothing .
This is intentional .
The support process is designed to filter out the idiots which means if you want to actually find a living breathing human being , you must subject yourself to a series of idiot tests .
This is why I reserve customer support excursions for dire situations .
No DSL for half a day is dire .
Let ’s go .
My first ten minutes on the phone are spent in admiration for how far voice recognition has come .
First off , it ’s working 95 % of the time , which is significant .
I ’ve been making fun of voice recognition for the better part of a decade , so seeing it applied in a real - time business situation is cool .
Also , my DSL provider has done something smart with the recordings which guide me along .
The recordings use common language … sometimes slang .
For example :
VOICE ON PHONE :
If you ’re looking for information about new DSL service , say “ New ” .
If you ’re having problems with your existing DSL line , say “ Problem ” .
ME : Problem .
VOICE ON PHONE : Got it .
Got it ?
That ’s slick .
This use of relaxed language gives me the impression I ’m dealing with less of a corporate monolith , but we ’re just getting started .
My call proceeds via the automated customer support center and I figure out there ’s an outage in Sacramento that “ could ” apply to me .
Problem is , Sacramento is 100 + miles away from Randsville and that ’s far enough for me to push a little harder , so I do it …
I say , “ Operator ” .
Here ’s the transcript :
REAL VOICE ON PHONE : “ Hi , thank you for calling SBC .
My name is [ pause ] Joe .
How many I help you ? ”
Now , I ’m always terribly nice to customer support folks .
Even though I ’ve just spent 30 minutes jumping through idiot hoops to get to them .
They ’re just doing their job and being kind sometimes helps .
ME : “ Joe , hi .
My DSL has been offline for 12 hours now and I ’d like to get some information about when I might get my DSL back . ”
JOE : Let me first start by apologizing on behalf of SBC for this inconvenience .
Can I have your DSL account number please ?
Joe ’s laying it a bit thick , but ok .
Whatever .
ME : Sure , it ’s ###-#####.
JOE : Thank you .
Sir , if may ask , what is your name ?
ME : It ’s Rands Pantalones .
JOE : Thank you .
Sir , if I may ask , may I call you by my first name ?
Ok , what the hell ?
Now , you should ’ve guessed this is clearly outsourced customer support .
No big news there .
It ’s also pretty clear that “ Joe ” is reading from a series of carefully scripted cue cards .
Even if his delivery was n’t so stilted , the content of the questions just scream FOCUS GROUP DERIVED FEEL GOOD CONVERSATION TECHNIQUES .
Let ’s move on .
We continue .
He tells me what I already heard from the automated customer service .
There ’s an outage , but it ’s over 100 miles away and I want to make sure I ’m a part of that 100 - mile radius , so I push Joe a bit .
ME : Joe , Sacramento is far away .
Can you confirm that my outage and the Sacramento outage are the same thing ?
JOE : [ long pause ]
Rands , let me again apologize on behalf of SBC for this inconvenience .
A moment please .
[ another long pause ]
Rands , do you like sports ?
RIGHT OK NOW YOU’VE BLOWN IT JOE .
I realize the cue card says , “ Choose from one of the following MAKE A CONNECTION WITH THE CUSTOMER questions ” , but I ’m becoming more comfortable with the thought of dealing with the voice recognition system rather than Joe .
It ’s not that I believe Joe is n’t a decent human being … he ’s just on the other side of the planet and I do n’t know shit about cricket and he knows less about ice hockey , so why are we doing this dance ?
My discomfort with the Joe experience would be good segue into an incensed rant into the evils of outsourcing , but I do n’t want to go there .
I ’m happy Joe has a job and I ’m sorry about whoever lost their job back in the States , but I have one piece of advice for both of you .
Cogs get outsourced .
Key Exports
Last month , I spent an hour explaining to the dean of a local college what kind of curriculum he should be schlepping to the local Silicon Valley kids .
His first question was , “ What is your hardest technical question ? ”
Before I answer , a brief aside .
Yes , I ’ve lost some sleep worrying about the perception that high tech jobs are being shipping over seas .
More importantly , I ’ve fretted that declining enrollments in computer science programs are direct result of this outsourcing .
A decrease in the programming population in the US of A would mean it ’d be harder for me to hire a fresh out of college guy / gal to beat up for a few years , but I ’ve got some really good news for you .
The next generation already knows more about computers than you do and they have n’t even made it to college yet .
The current generation never knew a home without a computer .
They assume they have ready access to just about any piece of information … and they ’re probably working on their own Linux distribution right now .
As a means of shaping your brain for critical thinking , I ’m going to give college two thumbs up .
As a requirement for doing great work in the software development industry , I ’m going to give a college degree a long “ Hmmmmmmm ” while I slowly stroke my goatee .
Back to the question , “ What is the Rands ’ hardest technical question ? ”
ME : “ I do n’t ask technical questions . ”
Listen , if you ’re sitting in my office for an interview , I am assuming you ’ve got technical chops .
We would n’t have let you in the door unless we could figure out from looking at your resume that you had the technical skills to do the job .
Does n’t matter if you ’re a college hire or Mr. Lord of the Database .
I ’m not vetting you for technical ability , I ’m vetting you for the breadth of your vision , I measuring your ambition , and I ’m looking for a sign that you believe you can change the world .
Really .
If all you want to be is a cog in the machine , quietly hiding in the 27th floor of the Behemoth Corporation , Inc. , well , that ’s great , but here ’s the deal : cogs get outsourced .
As I ’ve already discussed , jobs that can be “ well specified ” are being shipped offshore .
High tech moved manufacturing offshore a long time ago and now we ’re in the midst of pushing technical and customer support there .
These are jobs which can be described with a flowchart , a specification , a means by which the job can be performed in a reliable and measurable way .
Think about Joe ’s job .
He ’s spending his day following a well - defined routine .
These are the calls and this is the flowchart .
Joe has a daily metric .
Joe , you are successful if you resolve 27 calls per day .
More is good .
Less is bad .
The definition of this metric is why SBC is ok with outsourcing their customer support overseas .
They did the math .
27 calls a day in the US is $ 50.00 and 27 calls overseas is $ 30.00 .
Multiply that by 27 million calls they do a year and you ’re talking serious bank .
Joe is happy he ’s got a gig and so am I , but just because his country provides a better dollar per call ratio does n’t mean he ’s got a guaranteed gig .
Watch , two years from now Fezlakistan will burst onto the outsourcing stage and guess how long it ’ll take your corporate behemoths to do math and start shipping their cogs there .
Sorry , Joe. Keep reading .
I can help .
Interfacing with Humans Pays Big Bucks
Well - defined QA and engineering is right on the tail of manufacturing and that ’s A - OK with me because nothing that I ’ve done in just under two decades of software development has been well - defined .
Seriously .
I ’m coming up on almost 15 years straight of non -stop development , crunch cycles , and fire drills .
I work hard on improving process and quality , but it ’s hard to write a good spec when the VP of Engineering is telling you that if we do n’t get Customer X that feature , well , 150 people lose their job .
So , make the call , do n’t sleep for two days to get the product out or write a spec that is going to make QA and Documentation ’s job easier ?
The process weenies out there are now standing at their desks viciously shaking their finger at the screen as they read this .
They are saying , “ Rands , you just got lucky .
You ’ve just been fortunate enough to land at successful companies where these fly by the seat of your pants design shenanigans can exist because the cash is pouring in elsewhere . ”
Really ?
Fifteen years , four companies , and six promotions later … you think I ’m winging it ?
No , I just looking like I ’m winging it because I never stop moving .
Seriously , I do not specialize in hardened software that keeps submarines pointed in the right direction .
I work on software where the primary user is you , the person who stares at the bleeding edge and thinks , “ What ’s next ? ” Predicting this future is a messy business .
There is a distinct lack of flowcharts .
Practically zero spreadsheets .
People argue a lot , but they ’re arguing because the best way to refine an idea is to throw it in a mosh pit of creative people , wait , and then see what emerges .
Jobs in this crazy design arena , so far , are safe simply because :
You ca n’t outsource creativity .
You ca n’t outsource thinking .
You ca n’t outsource passion .
Our Peculiar Accent
The number of people needed to create a viable product is decreasing .
We need fewer folks who make widgets and more folks who are staring at the entire widget landscape and wondering , “ I wonder what happens when I put Widget X near Widget Y… Hmmmmm …
I think I ’ll call it Flickr . ”
I ’m not suggesting that it takes any less hard work or collection of bright college brains to get these ideas off the ground , but I do know that within the circles I travel , there is a distinct optimism regarding ideas .
Folks believe they can do anything .
I love to think this sense of entrepreneurial spirit is an American asset , but that ’s absurd .
If we have to outsource something , let ’s work on outsourcing that .
Let ’s show the rest of the planet the excitement Borland felt when it started to go toe - to - toe with Microsoft .
Let ’s demonstrate the enthusiasm a bunch of midwest college kids felt when they realized this browser thing they wrote was changing the world .
If we have anything to share with the rest of the planet , it ’s our own peculiar entrepreneurial accent .
Myfanwy Marshall 's boyfriend is one of those whose condition is critical .
Doctors have warned he could die at any time .
She says he decided to take part in the trial - which paid about £ 2,000 - because he needed some money to pay his bills .
" He saw the ad , he told me it was for a leukaemia drug .
He 'd taken part in trials before and been fine .
" I did n't want him to do it , but he said he was helping mankind , helping scientific knowledge . "
I can see beyond the wires - I know he's in there

Myfanwy , 35 , said he went into the Parexel unit at Northwick Park to begin the trial on Monday morning .
She received a call from the hospital at 3 am the next day .
Doctors said her boyfriend had had a bad reaction to the drug .
She said the man she knew was " completely gorgeous , a beautiful person , really buoyant , oozing with charm and really muscly . "
Now , she says , her 28 - year - old boyfriend who runs a bar in London , has changed beyond all recognition .
' In the dark '
" I went in expecting to see his smiley face and curly black hair .
" But he was completely lifeless .
He 's like a shell of who he is .
" He can't even move his eyelids .
" This machine is pumping out his lungs .
His chest is puffed out , his face is puffed out like the elephant man .
" A day ago I was talking to him and he was fine and now they are saying he could die at any moment . "
She said his friends cannot bear to see him .
His parents , who live abroad , are currently trying to get over to the UK .
They say he needs a miracle

Myfanwy added : " I can't hold his hand because of the tubes .
But I have to stay there because I can see beyond the wires .
I know he 's in there .
" I sit and talk into his ear and tell his body to heal itself . "
Myfanwy said doctors were working round the clock to treat the affected men , and were talking to scientists in the US and Germany who had worked on the development of the drug .
But she added : " The doctors say they are in the dark .
They do n't know the drug or what it can do .
" It 's a drug they have n't tested on humans before , so they do n't know what they 're dealing with .
All they can do is look at how his body has reacted . "
" They say he just needs to get the drug out of his system .
" They say he needs a miracle . "
The coverage in the Feb 13 Sydney Morning Herald was typical : Gunmen in separate US incidents today have randomly killed a number of shoppers in [ a ] mall and directors in a boardroom .
We had multiple simultaneous murder - suicide attacks on random individuals in public places .
But nobody called it terrorism .
Did you notice that ?
I did !
In the first incident , a gunman entered a mall in Salt Lake City in Utah and began randomly shooting , hitting several people before he was killed .
" We have six fatalities and multiple victims at hospitals , " police Detective Robin Snyder said .
" They were found throughout the mall .
I do n't know male or female or ages . "
The gunman must have been white , and Christian , or Jewish , or Mormon , or something .
Otherwise he would have been described differently , no ?
In the other incident a gunman killed three people at a business meeting before turning the gun on himself in a Philadelphia office building .
What color do you think this Philadelphia gunman was ?
What religion do you think he practiced ( if any ) ?
In Salt Lake City , Barb McKeown , 60 , of Washington , DC , was in [ an ] antique shop when two frantic women ran in and reported gunshots .
" Then we heard shot after shot after shot - loud , loud , loud , " she said .
She and three other people hid under a staircase until it was safe to leave .
...
The gunman was killed by an off - duty police officer who was in the mall at the time of the shooting , the Desert Morning News reported on its website .
More than three hours later , police were searching stores for shocked shoppers and employees who were hunkered down awaiting a safe escort from the mall .
In Philadelphia , a gunman killed three people at a business meeting before turning the gun on himself in a Philadelphia office building .
The gunman appeared to get upset at a board of directors meeting for a company that might have been an investment firm , police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross said .
...
Ross described the scene inside the conference room as " utter chaos " .
Utter chaos in two American cities , at least ten people dead , who knows how many hurt , others terrified and hiding under staircases for hours ; death and destruction out of a clear blue sky and not a motive to be seen ... but nobody says a word about " terrorism " .
Why ?
Because terrorism is something that happens somewhere else ?
Or because if attacks such as these were classified as terrorism , then the government would have to admit it 's not doing a very good job of protecting us from terrorism .
And this is the one and only thing the government claims to be doing .
~~~
I suppose in another few days we 'll be told these shooters were just " ordinary Americans " .
It happens all the time , does n't it ?
Where do these people -- these shooters , these so - called " ordinary Americans " -- get the idea that whenever they have a problem , the way to solve it is to go shoot somebody ?
Where does this idea come from ?
The president ought to sit down with his country , and explain to everybody -- once and for all -- that killing other people , ( over " investments " , or just because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ) -- is not the way to solve your problems .
If he can do that with a straight face , he can do anything !
After snatching the House with the closest thing to a crushing mandate ever likely in a system biased in favour of the incumbents , the Democrats now have their hands on the investigative machinery of Capitol Hill .
They can hire lawyers and detectives ; they can subpoena documents and compel witnesses to testify under oath ; they can mount show trials - or indeed real trials - subjecting their enemies to torment under the glaring klieg lights of the world media .
This is a powerful weapon , as Bill Clinton learned when Newt Gringrich stormed the House in 1994 , breaking the half - century stranglehold of the Democrats .
Newt ’s Republicans did not rest until they had impeached the president for perjury and abuse of office in the Paula Jonnes / Lewinsky saga - even if the meaker Senate later opted for acquittal ...
If the top echelons of the Bush administration have done anything wrong over the last six years in power , they can now expect to see every vile detail exposed in one of those menacing wood - panelled chambers on the Hill .
The first and most important act for a newly elected U.S. House and Senate is to impeach Donald Rumsfeld .
The defense secretary waged incompetent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , undermined the U.S. military , introduced torture , destroyed U.S. credibility worldwide , lied to the American people , caused the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians , failed to catch the perpetrators of 9/11 despite access to unlimited funds and caused the U.S. to enter a long period of isolation from the world .
I expect that [ Rep. John ]
Conyers as chairman [ of the House Judiciary Committee ] , now with great freedom , will do anything he can to commence such impeachment or investigatory activity , and we 'll see whether Pelosi will prevent it .
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard wrote in the Telegraph : Already there are signs that crimal investigations into the Bush administration will be the faire du jour for the next 24 months .
The Washignton Post has run an op -ed by Ahmed Rashid calling for the impeachment of Rumsfeld : Once Rumsfeld is in the sights , there is no reason not to go after Bush himself .
As Ed Koch , former mayor of New York predicted , there are many who are seeking to topple the president :
Pelosi has already signalled , strongly , that any talk of impeachment or prolonged investigation is off the table .
But for those who 've been on vacation , Bush is on the political agenda and in John Conyers ' sights for several reasons : i ) constitutional authority was exceeded when he falsified intelligence and lied to Congress and the American people in order to invade Iraq ; ii ) subverting democracy and the constitution through illegal surveillance of US citizens as well as violating international treaties through " extraordinary renditions " , secret prisons and torture .
All said , Conyers in his 350 page report The Constitution in Crisis ; The Downing Street Minutes and Deception , Manipulation , Torture , Retribution , and Cover-ups in the Iraq War , and Illegal Domestic Surveillance found that the Bush administration had violated 26 laws and regulations .
And that does n't even begin to touch topic such as Haliburton and corruption .
Whether a Democratic Congress --- its sights already trained on 2008 and the presidential election --- has the stomach , or the testicular fortitude to proceed with large - scale inquiries remains to be seen .
All politics aside , if the U.S. is to regain any credibilty among its allies and well - wishers , if it is to restore a healthy , functioning democracy at home , housecleaning is in order .
Two kinds of corruption afflict the American body politic today : the banal , everyday steal - from - the - public - purse kind exemplified by war contracts , and a deeper sort manifested by the wholesale abandonment of the founding ideals of liberty and justice in favour of darker principles of cynicism , public manipulation , and police - state tactics .
It is the latter corruption that is worrisome .
Having watched this corruption in the American republic metastasize for the past 6 years , a thorough purge would be welcome and necessary .
Whatever the outcome , with a large gobblet in hand , the Upper Canadian toasts those who are in a position to right wrongs and persecute the wicked .
Let 's hope they do so .
cdrkit : Debian 's fork of cdrtools
From : Joerg Jaspert < joerg- AT - ganneff.de >
To : debian - devel - announce-AT-lists.debian.org
Subject : cdrkit ( fork of cdrtools ) uploaded to Debian , please test Date : Mon , 04 Sep 2006 00:16:41 +0200
Hi we , the Debian maintainers of cdrtools , the cdrecord / mkisofs / cdda2wav program suite , just uploaded cdrkit into the Debian archive .
It will hit your unstable box with the next run of dinstall , please help us and test it .
This is a fork of the well - known cdrtools suite provided by Jörg Schilling .
It will replace his cdrtools package in Debian ( cdrtools will be removed a day later ) .
The tarball for this release can be found on http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/
or on your friendly debian mirror after the next archive run .
Now we need your help to be sure we release a working version with etch .
If you are a user : - test it , with whatever you have to burn .
Report anything broken which is not the fault of your hardware :)
If you are a maintainer of a program depending on cdrecord / mkisofs / cdda2wav : - change the dependency from cdrecord to wodim and change your program to call wodim , not cdrecord - test your program if it continues to work with the changes .
In theory it should , but we all know Master Murphy just too well .
Now , for the background on why we took the decision to fork cdrtools : Forking cdrtools as cdrkit --------------------------
So , why the fork ?
CD / DVD burning is a complicated business that needs a lot of knowledge , so forking such a big collection is n't a step to be taken lightly .
It requires a lot of development effort that could be put to better use elsewhere .
In the past , we , the Debian maintainers of cdrtools , had a good and mutually cooperative relationship with Jörg Schilling .
He even commented on Debian bug reports , which is one of the best things an upstream maintainer can do .
Naturally , there were occasionally disagreements , but this is normal .
Unfortunately Sun then developed the CDDL [ 1 ] and Jörg Schilling released parts of recent versions of cdrtools under this license .
The CDDL is incompatible with the GPL .
The FSF itself says that this is the case as do people who helped draft the CDDL .
One current and one former Sun employee visited the annual Debian conference in Mexico in 2006 .
Danese Cooper clearly stated there that the CDDL was intentionally modelled on the MPL in order to make it GPL - incompatible .
For everyone who wants to hear this first - hand , we have video from that talk available at [ 2 ] .
You can read the FSF position about the CDDL at [ 3 ] .
The thread behind [ 4 ] contains statements on the issue made by Debian people ; for more context also see the other mails in that thread .
In short - the CDDL has extra restrictions , which the GPL does not allow .
Jörg has a different opinion about this and has repeatedly stated that the CDDL is not incompatible , interpreting a facial expression in the above - mentioned video , calling us liars and generally appearing unwilling to consider our concerns ( he never replied to the parts where we explained why it is incompatible ) .
As he has basically ignored what we have said , we have no choice but to fork .
While the CDDL * may * be a free license , we never questioned if it is free or not , as it is not our place to decide this as the Debian cdrtools maintainers .
However , having been approved by OSI does n't mean it's ok for any usage , as Jörg unfortunately seems to assume .
There are several OSI - approved licenses that are GPL - incompatible and CDDL is one of them .
That is and always was our point .
For our fork we used the last GPL - licensed version of the program code and killed the incompatibly licensed build system .
It is now replaced by a cmake system , and the whole source we distribute should be free of other incompatibilities , as to the best of our current knowledge .
Anyone who wants to help with this fork , particularly developers of other distributions , is welcome to join our efforts .

-- bye Joerg < helix > doogie : you have an interesting definition for ' interact with people ' that means ' make them want to jump off cliffs '
So sayeth John McKay , one of the fired USAs in the US Attorney / Alberto Gonzales scandal on Meet the Press this morning .
MR. McKAY : Well , we really do n’t — it tells me that , that the Justice Department and , and the administration and the President have a responsibility now to deal with the black cloud that ’s hanging over the Department of Justice .
The — our former colleagues who were United States attorneys and the career men and women who do the work of the Department of Justice are ... are people of great integrity .
The last thing they need to deal with is an implication that politics are allowed into the grand jury .

Iglesias has serious doubts about the integrity of Alberto Gonzales ...( transcript below the fold )
MTP
MR. RUSSERT : " ... Republican candidate for governor was elected , then that ’s a terrible thing . ”
Very close race for the governorship in your state , the Democrat won by just a handful of votes .
You looked into the case , decided you did not find voter fraud .
When you applied for a federal judgeship , that issue was raised with you .
Correct ?
MR. McKAY : That ’s correct .
I , I was able to go into the White House in a meeting with Harriet Miers and her deputy Bill Kelly , and the very first question that I was asked was , was in reference to the 2004 governor ’s election .
MR. RUSSERT : And did they ask you why you did not go forward with an investigation or with indictments ?
MR. McKAY : No , they actually asked me why Republicans in the state of Washington would be angry with me .
And , of course , all of the actions taken by the federal government , which were not publicly discussed , were well - known to , to my supervisors and , and those who follow our work in Washington , D.C.
So I was a little surprised that they would ask me about that , since our office had carefully reviewed the evidence , and really , in the case of the 2004 governor ’s election here , the lack of evidence .
And the decision that I made not to go forward was a really unanimous decision with the Seattle division of the FBI .
So , so from our standpoint , it was n’t controversial from an evidentiary standpoint , even though it was very controversial in the state of Washington .
And , you know , we expected to be supported by people in Washington , D.C. , when we make tough decisions like that .
And I think that ’s a , a really important problem here that folks who , who raise their hand and take — took the same oath I did to support and defend the Constitution did n’t do the same thing we did , which was focus on the evidence and not allow politics into the work that we do in , in criminal prosecutions .
MR. RUSSERT : When you look at these cases , the situation you ’re talking about where there was a close governor ’s race in state of Washington , a Democrat won , you looked at it , did not find anything untoward .
Mr. Iglesias investigating the activities of Democrats did not act as quickly , perhaps , as some Republican office holders wanted him to .
In California , a Republican congressman indicted and convicted , another was under investigation .
In each of these districts , a highly controversial , perhaps even explosive political investigation going on .
Mr. McKay , what does that tell you in your mind as to why U.S. attorneys were let go ?
MR. McKAY : Well , we really do n’t — it tells me that , that the Justice Department and , and the administration and the president have a responsibility now to deal with the black cloud that ’s hanging over the Department of Justice .
The — our former colleagues who were United States attorneys and the career men and women who do the work of the Department of Justice are , are people of great integrity .
The last thing they need to deal with is an implication that politics are allowed into the grand jury .
You know , when you ’re looking at , at the business end of a federal grand jury , chances are someone is going to federal prison .
And it ’s critical , it ’s absolutely critical that no one think that politics enter into that kind of a decision in an — in an individual case .
And we work hard as federal prosecutors , and I ’m , I ’m proud to have served in this position and to know that my colleagues will continue to work very , very hard to make sure politics do n’t make the difference , but only evidence does .
MR. RUSSERT : Mr. Iglesias , when you hear Mr. McKay talk about the questions he was asked about the governor ’s race in the state of Washington , your own situation , a senator , a congressman calling you , California , the removal of a U.S. attorney there when an investigation began about a Republican congressman , do you connect those dots and say , “ My God , we , we were removed for political reasons ” ?
MR. IGLESIAS : It ’s extremely troubling .
The United States attorneys have a history , under various administrations , of being independent .
We look at the facts , we apply the law .
If we have proof beyond a reasonable doubt , we go forward .
Politics have historically not played a part .
I recall John Ashcroft sitting me in , in his office and saying , “ Politics have no part of your job as a U.S. attorney . ”
So it is troubling connecting those political dots .
And I hope when this scandal is over , the tradition is returned to that as United States attorneys keep politics out and just focus on what the evidence is .
MR. RUSSERT : Knowing what you know today , do you have confidence in the leadership and the integrity of the attorney general ?
MR. IGLESIAS : Right now I ’ve got serious doubts .
I really do .
It was a replay of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial .
Only this time , evolution beat creationism .
At the federal courthouse in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , last fall , US District Court judge John E. Jones III listened as proponents of intelligent design argued that their supposedly scientific alternative to evolutionary theory should be presented in biology classes in the Dover Area school district .
Jones did n’t buy it .
A Republican lawyer who worked his way up through state politics and was appointed to the bench by George W. Bush in 2002 , Jones issued a blistering decision against the school board .
Intelligent design , he wrote in a meticulously documented decision , is “ an inherently religious proposition . ”
– Mark Robinson
Excerpts from Kitzmiller v. Dover School District , December 2005 :
[ An ] objective student can reasonably infer that the [ school ]
District ’s favored view is a religious one , and that the District is accordingly sponsoring a form of religion .
Intelligent design ’s backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy , but not intelligent design itself , should be taught in science class .
This tactic is at best disingenuous , and at worst a canard .
The goal of the intelligent design movement is not to encourage critical thought , but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with intelligent design .
Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge .
If so , they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court .
Rather , this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill - informed faction on a school board , aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on intelligent design , who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy .
The breathtaking inanity of the Board ’s decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial .
The students , parents , and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom , with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources .

So far as the yet very quiet forums are claiming , a new app called FairUse4WM can be used to strip Windows Media DRM 10 and 11 ( i.e. PlaysForSure , but not WM DRM 9 ) .
Yes , yes , we know , we 've heard this song and dance before .
But before we proceed , let 's just be totally clear on how the system works : providers like Napster and Yahoo Music Unlimited provide subscription service for unlimited access to Windows Media DRMed files ; stop paying the fee , stop getting access to the files -- but you already knew all this .
We tried FairUse4WM and we can verify that it quickly and easily stripped the DRM from our Napster To Go tracks , and made them freely available to play on our Mac ( which , of course , has Flip4Mac installed ) .
In other words , it 's a simple , apparently lossless , one - step method for making your files playable after you 're no longer paying fees on your subscription service .
The app did n't work on our Vongo videos , but we can verify with all certainty that yes , Windows Media DRM can now be easily and quickly stripped from PlaysForSure media services .
Now watch as Microsoft shuts down the forums and runs damage control in order to prevent an digital media entire platform from collapsing .
Click on for a couple more pics of the app in action !
P.S. - Kinda goes without saying but we take absolutely zero accountability for what you may do with FairUse4WM , ok ?
[ Thanks , Frank ]
Defining a coding standard
A coding standard is a set of conventions regulating how code must be written .
These conventions usually cover formatting , naming and common idioms .
Choosing them can be a painful process as it frequently leads to endless and passionate discussions between developers ( how many hours have been lost arguing the positioning of curly - braces in Algol derived languages ) .
Yes , us developers have an acute sense of aesthetics when it comes to our code — probably only rivalled in intensity by our legendary lack of aesthetics in the clothing department .
In my experience , the best way to select a set of conventions is to have one experienced programmer act as a dictator .
After all , no coding standards has ever pleased everyone .
Enforcing the standard
Coding standards are like speed limits : they are A Good Thing™ but they are useless unless they are respected .
There are several ways to enforce the rules .
Code reviews are probably the least efficient ( do n’t get me wrong : having code reviews is a very valuable practice , but not to enforce a coding standard ) .
Using a code formatting tool when code is checked in the source control management system is more efficient .
However , these tools rarely cover naming conventions and common idioms .
Most IDE s can be configured to warn when the conventions are not followed and format the code on the fly .
But the most efficient way is to use a dedicated tool and integrate it in the build system — particularly when using continuous integration .
The best example I have come across is Checkstyle .
Not only does it integrate easily in a build system but it can also be used as a plug - in in most Java IDEs .
One stone , two birds and no more escaping the coding standard !
Benefits
At the very least , adhering to a coding standard allows a developer to read a piece of code written by another developer while focusing only on the content , because she is familiar with the form .
If you think this is mildly important during the development phase of a project , think about the maintenance phase .
Undoubtedly , enhanced readability leads to better maintainability .
What is less obvious is that a coding standard can also improve the design of a piece of software .
In my experience , no rule has a greater impact on design than what I call the “ 20 lines ” rule .
The “ 20 lines ” rule
It goes like this :
No method body shall be longer than 20 lines .
Period .
Yes , that ’s all : no big formula and no esoteric concept , just a simple little rule that absolutely anyone can understand .
Its power lies in its simplicity .
You see , 20 lines of code is more than enough to express an idea concisely and it is also about the right amount of information the eye and the brain can scan and comprehend without having to do too much double - takes — not that I have data to back this up , but 20 lines happens to snugly fit in most screens / windows used while coding , thus reading the code does not require interrupting the train of thought by scrolling .
If the only impact of this rule was enhanced readability , you would accuse me of false advertisement .
Most benefits from this rule actually cascades from the side effects of breaking down a large method in a set of smaller methods .
The most dramatic effect is the reduction of the cyclomatic complexity of the code .
Here comes the esoteric concept !
Crudely , the cyclomatic complexity of a piece of code is a measure of the number of possible execution paths through it .
Less execution paths means less execution paths to test .
Bingo !
We have just simplified our unit tests .
The emergence of smaller methods improves abstraction and reusability .
Indeed , very frequently these methods can be invoked in other parts of the code base , thus reducing redundant code .
I am certainly forgetting other effects but I hope you get my point : the “ 20 lines ” rule is a really low hanging fruit .
I frequently realize how far reaching its usage as had on the code I have written .
Finally , the “ 20 lines ” rule could have been Fight Club ’s ninth rule : it does not accept exceptions , as exceptions to this rule are precisely when this rule should be applied .
Give it a go , you will be surprised by how quick you ’ll start reaping the rewards !

AUGUST 21-- In a remarkable bit of corporate insensitivity , Northwest Airlines brass gave workers it is laying off a booklet offering ' 101 Ways To Save Money , ' including ' do n't be shy about pulling something you like out of the trash ' and 'ask your doctor for samples of prescriptions . '
The booklet was included in a layoff packet recently given to dozens of pink - slipped workers in North Dakota , Montana , and Texas .
After employee complaints , Northwest apologized and yanked the list from undistributed packets ( the 101 tips were drawn up by a Northwest vendor charged with preparing materials for workers to help them deal with pending unemployment ) .
A copy of the bankrupt airline 's offensive booklet can be found below .
Along with the dumpster diving suggestion , Northwest recommended shorter showers , thrift store shopping , and getting ' hand - me - down clothes and toys for your kids from friends and relatives . '
Not to mention ' grow your own vegetables and herbs ' and 'use old newspapers for cat litter . ' ( 4 pages )

New wage data indicate what you might have suspected .
Average wages are not keeping up with the cost of living .
This has given rise to claims that we live in the first sustained period of economic growth that has failed to offer a similarly sustained increase in real wages .
Indeed , wages have declined in real terms by 2 percent in the last three years .
The first concern is political .
The Democrats , despite their moderating image , carry with them the intellectual baggage of a Marxist morality play in which business skims the excess productivity of labor 's value .
This new data is framed in a way that plays right into this model .
Productivity is up , the rich are richer , but the workers are losing out .
Meanwhile , the Republicans have a very strange response , as typified by the comments of pollster Frank Luntz .
The bad economic news would not do serious damage to Republicans , he said , because voters will blame corporate America and not government for their problems .
Now , there is a lot buried in these comments .
The Republicans have dined out on the mistaken impression that they are the anti-government party .
Here we see a change .
The pollster just assumes that anti-government feeling will redound against the Republicans , since this is the party that controls government , after all .
I have my doubts that he is right .
Republicans have controlled the White House — Carter and Clinton excepted — for the better part of forty years , and yet somehow they are always able to get away with blaming government for their problems .
I can easily imagine that the Republicans will again trot out their anti-government rhetoric this time around .
But we shall see .
In the meantime , this data needs unpacking .
The reason for the fall in income has nothing to do with corporate profits .
The culprit is our old friend inflation .
But more than ever , inflation data does not reflect the underlying reality we experience every day .
As we all know , there is no such thing as a price level as such .
There are only prices , some of which rise and some of which fall .
There is no way that the government can collect enough information to make sense of it all .
Take a trip to Wal - Mart , for example .
You do n't see price increases here .
You can buy shirts , jackets , and shoes for a fraction of what you would have paid ten years ago .
This is even true for electronics and most other goods you find in so - called department stores .
How can we even talk of inflation with astounding realities like this ?
Indeed , this is reflected in the broad data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Roughly the same pattern is seen in apparel markets generally .
How can we account for this ?
Two factors : entrepreneurship and international trade .
In the first category , we have to include Wal - Mart but also Target , as well as hundreds of other shops that carry discounted items .
We love these stores , and their cost - cutting ways have been a boon for the American consumer .
Imagine what would have happened to the overall CPI were it not for them .
And yet the people who are currently wailing about the declines in real income give these retailers no credit for keeping our living standards from falling lower than they otherwise would have .
These stores are a major source of American prosperity , and we need ever more of them .
Their access to international markets for producer and consumer goods is another reason .
Markets around the world are opening by the day .
The division of labor is globalized as never before .
This too has been great for the American consumer .
Meanwhile , however , those who want to draw attention to the decline in real wages are apt to blame trade for part of the problem , rather than giving credit where it is due .
How , then , can we account for the price data that is eating away at our living standards ?
Consider :
Now , here we have the exact opposite pattern , and from a sector of the economy that is heavily regulated , taxed , and beaten to death by interventionist regulations .
There is far less supply flexibility in oil and gas because of trade restrictions , stupid wars , and insane and counterproductive environmental controls .
When shocks hit , the only market response is to increase rationing via price increases .
Let us draw attention to a sector that is even more heavily controlled by government .
Indeed , this is a sector that is directly administered by public agencies that enjoy a complete monopoly on service provision :
Here again we see big increases , as felt by American consumers across the board , all summer long .
The same story can be told about other government - controlled sectors such as education and health care .
There is a final underlying source of our troubles .
Despite the Fed 's continued interest - rate increases , the money supply continues to grow .
The largest increases date especially from 2001 through 2004 , pausing for a brief period in 2005 .
This year , the monetary increases have begun again .
The United States benefits by being the host to the world 's reserve currency , but eventually there is a price to be paid .
In other words , the increases in prices are due to both Fed policy and to sectors that are not responsive to market supply and technological change .
The sectors in which prices are falling show the trends that they do despite Fed policy and precisely because they are responsive to market supply pressure .
The answer to our standard - of - living woes is a radical restructuring that would make education , health care , and energy look and behave much more like retail discount stores and apparel .
What the American worker needs is more of what Wal - Mart offers and less of what the government offers .
If we could then fix the Fed so that it would no longer water down the value of our money , we 'd never have to worry about declining real wages again .
If you have ugly animal images - be they your own pets , or images you found online - or if you have a request for certain animals you want to see profiled , let us know .

I 've spent part of my tenure here at Ars trying to warn people about the encroaching affront to our culture being brought about at the behest of the entertainment industry .
It has consistently been my position that technologies like " Digital Rights Management " are less about preventing piracy , and more about finding new ways to nickel - and - dime customers .
Through DRM and " contracts " for content , fair use rights are being eroded .
Of course , the industry is trying to accomplish its objective by publicly lamenting piracy .
If the public and " their " politicians believe that the entertainment industry is on the verge of collapse , they 'll be much more likely to accept restrictions on use of content that they 've paid for .
For this reason , most industry talking heads keep their comments in check when talking about DRM schemes , but from time to time we 've seen people truly speak their mind .
Such is the case with Tommi Kyyrä , of IFPI Finland .
Mr. Kyyrä told Tietokone ( Finnish ) that the ability to play CDs on computers is a " privilege , " and that people who have problems with CDs laden with DRM should just buy new CD players .
" Now , we need to understand that listening to music on your computer is an extra privilege .
Normally people listen to music on their car or through their home stereos , " said Kyyrä .
" If you are a Linux or Mac user , you should consider purchasing a regular CD player . "
( Translation via tigert.com )
The comments come in the context of a debate over copy - protected CDs .
As we have previously reported , CDs with copy protection do not play on all CD players , although this is certainly not just limited to computer CD players .
Some older players also wo n't play the discs , either .
Curiously , Mr. Kyyrä 's inflammatory remarks have since been removed from the story ( comparative screenshots ) .
More recently we 've learned that the entertainment industry is embracing a content protection scheme that will effectively give them control over whether or not you can play high - definition optical discs on your computer .
I recently covered Microsoft 's position in all of this mess ; if Microsoft would n't support HDCP , high - definition optical discs would be entirely off - limits on Windows computers .
Supporting HDCP is n't a panacea , however .
Computers without secure video pathways will either degrade the quality of video displayed , or refuse to play them at all .
The situation is rather complex , and I suggest checking out my coverage .

I have never had a very good relationship with Mathematics .
I used to think it was me …
I thought that perhaps I was just a bit put off by Math ’s confident demeanor and superior attitude , and by its tendency to micromanage every tiny detail of my universe .
But over time I have come to the realization that I ’m not the source of the problem .
Math , as it turns out , is out of its bloody mind .
Consider the following example : Assuming for a moment that birthdays are evenly distributed throughout the year , if you ’re sitting in a room with forty people in it , what are the chances that two of those people have the same birthday ?
For simplicity ’s sake , we ’ll ignore leap years .
A reasonable , intelligent person might point out that the odds do n’t reach 100 % until there are 366 people in the room ( the number of days in a year + 1 ) … and forty is about 11 % of 366 … so such a person might conclude that the odds of two people in forty sharing a birthday are about 11 % .
In reality , due to Math ’s convoluted reasoning , the odds are about 90 % .
This phenomenon is known as the Birthday Paradox .
If the set of people is increased to sixty , the odds climb to above 99 % .
This means that with only sixty people in a room , even though there are 365 possible birthdays , it is almost certain that two people have a birthday on the same day .
After making these preposterous assertions , Math then goes on to rationalize its claims by recruiting its bastard offspring : numbers and formulas .
It ’s tricky to explain the phenomenon in a way that feels intuitive .
You can consider the fact that forty people can be paired up in 780 unique ways , and it follows that there would be a good chance that at least one of those pairs would share a birthday .
But that does n’t really satisfy the question for me , it just feels marginally less screwy .
So I did something quite out of character : I crunched the numbers .
The values rapidly become unmanageable , but the trend is clear :
# of people Possible combinations of birthdays # of those combinations where at least two birthdays fall on the same day % of combinations where two people have same birthday 1 365 0 0.0 % 2 133,225 365 0.2 % 3 48,627,125 398,945 0.8 % 4 17,748,900,625 290,299,465 1.6 % 5 6,478,348,728,125 175,793,709,365 2.7 % 6 2,364,597,285,765,625 95,677,479,012,025 4.0 % 7 863,078,009,304,453,125 48,535,798,679,910,725 5.6 % 8 315,023,473,396,125,390,625 23,417,361,992,539,211,425 7.4 % 9 IF YOU PUSH THAT EQUALS BUTTON I WILL MAKE YOU BLEED .
SINCERELY , YOUR CALCULATOR .
END OF LINE .
5318008 ⁠—-
Only calculating up to eight people , we see that of the three hundred fifteen quintillion possible combinations of birthdays the group has , 7.4 % of cases ⁠ — or about one in thirteen⁠ — result in two of them having the same birthday .
As each person is added , the odds do not increase linearly , but rather they curve upwards rapidly .
This trend continues up to around twenty - three people , where the curve hits 50 % odds , and the rate of increase starts going down .
It practically flattens out when fifty - seven people are considered , and the odds rest at about 99 % .
Though it may not be intuitive , the numbers follow the pattern quite faithfully .
So does this mean that you can walk into a math class of forty students , bet them that at least two people in the room share a birthday , and win 90 % of the time ?
Not exactly .
In real life , where Math is not particularly welcome , birthdays are not distributed perfectly throughout the year .
More people are born in the springtime , which throws the numbers off .
Also , as a result of the way that hospitals operate , more babies are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends , which further complicates the problem .
Depending on the group of people and how evenly distributed their birthdays are , the results can vary widely .
But most of the time , you ’ll still have some very good odds .
But there is at least one highly practical application for this numerical phenomenon : computer hacking .
There is a classic cryptographic computer attack known as the “ birthday attack ” which exploits the math of the birthday paradox .
Using this method , a programmer can store the results of the birthday math in memory to decrease overall processing time when doing certain computationally useful things , such as attempting to crack a digital signature .
Another thing that I discovered in my research is that a one followed by fifty - one zeros is called one sexdecillion .
I knew those mathematician guys were hiding something in those big numbers .
As much as Math would like us to think that it is an advocate for structure and intuition , every once in a while it churns up something dastardly and unintuitive like the Birthday Paradox , the Monty Hall problem or Benford ’s Law .
And we have no choice but to obey these fickle whims of the great control freak .
But every once in a while , I like to divide by zero , just to show Math that I ’m not powerless to retaliate .
To those who would claim that only a fool would fall prey to the Birthday Paradox , and that the true nature of the odds is perfectly intuitive , I ask this of your Rainman - like grasp of numbers … why is it that all of the totals in this article ’s first chart ( aside from zero ) end in the digit five ?
That outcome surprised me , but I currently lack the conviction to pursue the matter .
I now see that numbers represent all that is soulless and wrong .
align ( Visual C++ Language Reference )
To create an array whose base is properly aligned , use _aligned_malloc , or write your own allocator .
Note that normal allocators , such as malloc , C++ operator new , and the Win32 allocators return memory that will most likely not be sufficiently aligned for __declspec( align ( # ) ) structures or arrays of structures .

Tips & Tricks für das kleine Stimmungshoch zwischendurch Sprachen lernen
Die effektivste Methode für Leute mit wenig Zeit Leserbriefe Unsere Leserumfrage
Themen der nächsten Ausgabe Themen der letzten Ausgaben Newsletter bestellen Wenn Ihnen durch Zufall in einem Antiquariat ein Sprachkurs von vor hundert Jahren in die Hände gerät  schauen Sie einmal nach , wie er aufgebaut ist .
Unsere Vorfahren paukten Vokabeln plus Grammatikregeln und versuchten dann , daraus fremdländische Sätze zusammenzubasteln .
Eine fremde Sprache sprechen ähnelte mehr einer Rechenaufgabe als echter Kommunikation .
Die Sprachpraxis wurde trainiert wie Kopfrechnen .
In sogenannten Drill - Übungen wurde immer wieder dieselbe grammatische Schwierigkeit mechanisch geübt , bis sie saß .
Das Sprechen war mühsam und langsam .
Es erforderte sehr viel Übung , um auf diese Weise zu einem halbwegs natürlichen Sprechen zu gelangen .
Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen hat man von dieser Methode Abschied genommen .
Heute wird die Konversationsmethode vorgezogen .
Der Schüler soll möglichst viel die echte Sprache hören und in natürlichen Sprechsituationen versuchen , sich zu verständigen .
Am besten funktioniert diese Methode in dem Land , in dem diese Sprache auch gesprochen wird .
Deswegen sind Sprachferien so beliebt .
Neben der Gelegenheit , das Gelernte nach Ende der Lektion sofort praktisch zu erproben , wirkt die Umgebung motivierend .
Man spürt unmittelbar , wozu man lernt .
Diese Methode beruht auf der Erkenntnis , daß jeder sich eine fremde Sprache aneignet , wenn er nur lange genug im Ausland lebt .
Frühere DDR - Studenten , die in Moskau studierten , benötigten zwei Jahre , dann beherrschten sie das schwierige Russisch fließend  und zwar alle , unabhängig von der Sprachbegabung .
Damit ist zugleich der Nachteil der Methode genannt .
Sie brauchen viel Zeit und ständig Leute um sich , die die Fremdsprache sprechen .
Die Leute kann man teilweise ersetzen : durch Hörkassetten , Videos , CDs und ähnliches .
Computergestützte Multimediakurse erkennen Aussprachefehler , präsentieren einem Land und Leute in Video - Sequenzen und liefern allzeit verfügbare Dialogpartner .
Aber der enorme Zeitaufwand bleibt .
Außerdem bleibt das so Gelernte nicht lange haften .
Ohne dauerndes Hören und Sprechen geht das einmal erlangte Sprachgefühl bald wieder verloren .
Was macht aber jemand , der für seinen Beruf Sprachkenntnisse benötigt , dem aber genau dieser Beruf keine Zeit für aufwendige Lernprogramme läßt ?
Der seine Sprachkenntnisse nicht ständig , sondern nur rund zwei- bis dreimal im Jahr benötigt  dann aber intensiv und möglichst perfekt ?
Wer als hoffnungsvoller Nachwuchs gilt , wird unter Umständen von seinem Unternehmen auf dessen Kosten geschult und immer wieder zu Auffrischungskursen geschickt .
Öfter aber muß man neben Fach- , Führungs - und Computerkenntnissen bereits Sprachkenntnisse vorweisen , um als hoffnungsvoller Nachwuchs eingestuft zu werden .
Ein Teufelskreis ohne Ausweg ?
Früher wie heute gab es immer wieder Wissenschaftler und Geschäftsleute , die trotz hoher Arbeitsbelastung Fremdsprachen lernten , ohne deshalb ihr hohes Arbeitspensum einzuschränken .
Das bekannteste Beispiel war Heinrich Schliemann .
Als Geschäftsmann erarbeitete er sich jahrzehntelang das Geld für seine späteren archäologischen Exkursionen , die er aus eigener Tasche finanzierte .
Er grub Troja und das Grab des Agamemnon aus .
Nebenbei lernte er zwanzig Sprachen .
Ein Ausnahmegenie ?
Vielleicht .
Aber es gibt weitere Beispiele .
Als Karl Marx für seine ökonomischen Studien russische Literatur lesen mußte , eignete er sich die notwendigen Kenntnisse innerhalb weniger Wochen an .
Von vielen Forschern ist bekannt , daß sie mehrere Sprachen lasen und sprachen .
Ende des letzten Jahrhunderts lernten Franzosen , Engländer und Amerikaner deutsch , um auf den Gebieten Physik und Chemie mitreden zu können .
( Deutschland galt in jenen Jahren als naturwissenschaftlich führend . )
Keiner von ihnen konnte sich Sprachferien oder mehrjährigen Unterrricht leisten .
Wie haben diese Leute Sprachen gelernt ?
Sie kauften sich ein Wörterbuch und eine Grammatik .
Mit deren
Hilfe nahmen sie sich originalsprachliche
Texte vor und übersetzten sie sorgfältig .
Dann lernten sie statt Vokabeln und Regeln die wichtigsten Textteile auswendig !
Ein Text , der alle benötigten Vokabeln und Grammatikregeln in ihrer Anwendung enthält , ist leichter zu merken als ellenlange Wortlisten .
Denn Sie lernen die Wörter im Zusammenhang .
Durch die Verbindung der Wörter merken
Sie sich außerdem , wie die fremde Sprache die Wörter und Grammatik tatsächlich anwendet .
Und : es geht Ihrem Gedächtnis keine einzige Vokabel und keine grammatische Regel verloren .
Sie sind alle Bestandteile des Textes , der zwischen ihnen einen unlöslichen , sinnvollen Zusammenhang herstellt .
Ich habe diese Lernerfahrung als Jugendlicher eher unbeabsichtigt gemacht .
Bis zur zehnten Klasse erhielt ich in den Sprachfächern meine schwächsten Zensuren .
Doch dann spielte ich Gitarre und lernte nach und nach eine Reihe von Liedtexten auswendig .
Manche Texte ( von Bob Dylan oder Simon & Garfunkel ) bieten weitaus mehr als  I love you oder  Dont leave me now .
Nach etwa dreißig Texten merkte ich , daß ich flüssig Englisch sprach und verstand .
Sie fragen sich vielleicht :  Oh Gott , muß ich da nicht Hunderte von Texten auswendig lernen ? 
Keineswegs .
Ich habe mit dieser Methode im Selbststudium später die französische Sprache gelernt  ohne Vorkenntnisse .
Dafür benötigte ich 21 Texte .
Der erste war zehn Zeilen , der letzte drei Seiten lang .
Diese Texte enthielten die gesamte Grammatik in der Anwendung und etwa 3000 Vokabeln .
Das ist mehr , als ein Abitur bietet .
Wenn
Sie täglich ein bis eineinhalb Stunden Zeit einplanen , können Sie dieses Pensum in weniger als einem halben Jahr schaffen .
Aber auch wenn
Sie nicht soviel Zeit haben , funktioniert dieses Vorgehen .
Sie brauchen in diesem Fall die Texte nur in kürzere Einheiten zu teilen .
Das Lernen der
Texte fällt nicht so schwer , wie Sie vielleicht vermuten  vorausgesetzt , sie haben sie korrekt übersetzt .
Das eigentlich Mühsame sind die Wiederholungen .
In weniger als einer Woche ist der gelernte Text aus Ihrem Gedächtnis wieder verschwunden , wenn Sie es beim einmaligen Lernen belassen .
Die Lernpsychologie hat für das effektive Wiederholen eine Regel entdeckt : die zeitlichen Abstände zwischen den Wiederholungen sollten sich mit jedem Mal verdoppeln .
Praktisch heißt das : Sie lernen zunächst den Text .
Er muß nicht perfekt sitzen , sondern nur so einigermaßen .
( Dafür benötigen Sie je nach Textlänge fünfzehn Minuten bis eine Stunde .
Mehr sollten Sie sich nicht auf einmal vornehmen . )
Die Festigung überlassen Sie dem Wiederholen .
Sie repetieren den neu gelernten
Text im Kopf noch mal eine halbe Stunde später .
Wenn
Sie stecken bleiben , schauen Sie ins Buch , prägen sich die Stelle erneut ein und machen dann im Kopf weiter .
Auf die gleiche Weise wiederholen Sie am nächsten Tag. Zunächst im Kopf , bei  Hängern schauen Sie ins Buch .
Dann schauen
Sie sich den gesamten
Text im Buch an , ob alles korrekt war , und wiederholen ihn ( ohne ins Buch zu schauen ) noch einmal .
Die nächste Wiederholung erfolgt nach zwei Tagen , dann nach vier Tagen , nach acht Tagen , sechzehn Tagen und so weiter .
Sie erreichen schnell einen Stand , wo Sie nur noch nach Monaten wiederholen brauchen .
Mit jeder Wiederholung verfestigt sich außerdem das Gelernte .
Der Text , der Ihnen beim Erlernen noch schwierig vorkam , voll von Zungenbrechern und merkwürdigen Konstruktionen , erscheint Ihnen nach der achten Wiederholung als etwas Vertrautes .
Von diesem Zeitpunkt an sitzen die Vokabeln und die Grammatik .
Wenn
Sie später ins Mutterland Ihrer Fremdsprache fahren und Vokabeln benötigen , blättern Sie gedanklich in Ihrem Text nach , wo das entsprechende Wort vorkam .
Sie werden schnell feststellen , daß Sie meist gar nicht groß nachdenken müssen .
Da Sie einen Haufen Mustersätze im Kopf haben , bilden Sie den benötigten Satz nach Gefühl .
Ihre Intuition warnt Sie sofort , wenn Ihr gerade gebildeter Fremdsprachensatz zu dem gelernten Muster in Widerspruch steht .
Sobald Sie den ersten Text Ihres Lernpensums zwei bis drei Mal wiederholt haben  also nach einer halben Woche  können Sie sich den zweiten
Text vornehmen .
Übersetzen , Wörter und neue Grammatikregeln anschauen , bis Sie sie verstanden haben .
Dann den
Text auswendig lernen .
Da das Wiederholungslernen im Kopf stattfindet , können Sie dafür Warte - und sonstige Leerzeiten nutzen .
In der U - Bahn , im Stau , in Wartezimmern , sogar während langweiliger Sitzung , bei denen Sie nur körperlich anwesend sein müssen .
Nur wenn
Sie sich eine neue Lektion erschließen , benötigen Sie Ruhe und Abgeschiedenheit .
Dadurch läßt sich das Lernen ohne weiteres in eine termingefüllte Arbeitswoche integrieren .
Die zuletzt gelernten Texte müssen
Sie häufiger wiederholen als die früheren .
Bei den früheren sind Sie schon bei größeren zeitlichen Abständen angelangt .
Wenn Sie pro Woche Ihrem Gedächtnis zwei neue Texte hinzufügen , können Sie nach zehn Wochen zwanzig Texte auswendig .
Sobald Sie den letzten
Text mindestens acht Mal wiederholt haben ( nach weiteren zwei Monaten ) sind Ihre Sprachkenntnisse anwendungsbereit .
Nun enthüllt sich ein weiterer Vorteil dieser Methode .
Wenn Sie von Zeit zu Zeit Ihre Texte wiederholen , können Sie Ihre Sprachkenntnisse nicht wieder vergessen !
Um meine 21 Französischtexte im Kopf aufzusagen , benötige ich eine bis eineinhalb Stunden .
Danach ist alles wieder parat .
Wenn ich also Besuch aus Frankreich erhalte oder selbst dorthin fahre , bin ich auf diese Weise in kürzester Zeit wieder fit .
Voraussetzung für diese Methode sind lediglich Regelmäßigkeit , Durchhaltewillen und ein durchschnittliches Gedächtnis .
Eine besondere Sprachbegabung ist nicht nötig .
Wo finden Sie die geeigneten Texte ?
Am ehesten in Sprachlehrbüchern , die in Lektionen untergliedert sind , welche mit einem
Text einsteigen und danach die Vokabeln , die Grammatik und ein paar Übungen anbieten .
Für den Grundkurs kaufen
Sie sich eine Kassette oder eine andere Tonkonserve dazu , wegen der korrekten Aussprache .
In meinem Französischkurs bestand der Grundkurs aus zehn , der Fortgeschrittenenkurs aus elf Lektionen .
( Leider gibt es ihn nicht mehr zu kaufen , deshalb verzichte ich auf eine Literaturangabe . )
Falls
Sie keine vorgefertigten Texte finden ( zum Beispiel , weil Sie sich mit einer besonders exotischen Sprache befassen ) , können Sie auch Originaltexte nehmen .
In diesem Fall steigen Sie am besten mit einem Ausschnitt aus einem Kinderbuch ein , zum Beispiel einem bekannten Märchen , das Sie auf deutsch schon kennen .
Oder einer Schulfibel aus jenem Land . Erschließen Sie sich den
Text mit Grammatik und Wörterbuch .
Erhöhen
Sie nach und nach den Schwierigkeitsgrad der Texte .
Leichte Texte für Erwachsene finden sich in Sachbüchern , die Alltagsthemen behandeln , und in einfach geschriebenen Romanen ( Krimis , Groschenromane ) .
Anspruchsvollere Texte zu unterschiedlichen Themen liefern Tageszeitungen .
Es empfiehlt sich Texte auszuwählen , die für Sie wichtige Informationen enthalten .
Das motiviert zusätzlich , sich die Sätze zu merken .
Wieviel müssen
Sie lernen , um eine Sprache tatsächlich zu beherrschen ?
Wenn jemand sagt  Ich kann drei Sprachen  wieviel muß er/sie wirklich können , damit die Aussage stimmt ?
Um sich notdürftig zu verständigen , reicht der Grundkurs .
Damit können
Sie nach dem
Weg fragen , im Laden nach einem Preis fragen , bezahlen und ähnliches .
Freilich sollten Sie ein Wörterbuch griffbereit dabei haben .
Nach einem Fortgeschrittenenkurs  vorausgesetzt , sie haben ihn nach unserer Methode durchgearbeitet  können Sie einfache Unterhaltungen zu Alltagsthemen führen , ohne Hände und Füße zu Hilfe nehmen zu müssen .
Sie können Originalliteratur lesen ( außer schwieriger Belletristik und spezieller Fachliteratur ) , ohne mehr als fünf Mal pro Seite im Wörterbuch nachzuschauen .
Sprachbeherrschung liegt freilich erst vor , wenn Sie sich in der Sprache bewegen können .
Das bedeutet nicht , daß Sie perfekt wie ein Muttersprachler sind .
Sie dürfen einen Akzent haben und müssen nicht jedes Wort kennen .
Aber Sie können Ihr Gegenüber verstehen und identifizieren ein unbekanntes Wort klar in einem Umfeld von lauter bekannten Wörtern .
Sie sind fähig , gezielt nachzufragen , was der unbekannte Ausdruck bedeutet .
Wenn
Sie selbst etwas erzählen wollen , und das passende Wort fällt Ihnen nicht ein , können Sie es umschreiben .
Beispiel :  Wie nennt man das ?
Die Straße ist voll Autos , der Verkehr bewegt sich nicht weiter .
Die Antwort verrät Ihnen , was  Stau in der Fremdsprache heißt .
Die Voraussetzungen hatte ich mit meinen 21 Französischtexten erreicht , freilich auf dem untersten Level .
Mit etwas Zusatzvokabular und dem gelegentlichen Lesen und Hören von französischen Texten konnte ich nach einigen Monaten das Niveau der Sprachbeherrschung erreichen .
Wenn Sie nun noch Gelegenheit finden , im lebendigen Gespräch Ihre Kenntnisse anzuwenden , hängt es nur noch von Ihnen ab , wann Sie in die letzten Geheimnisse der fremden Kultur eintauchen .

Welcome to the social
Microsoft Zune Player
Manufacturer : Microsoft ( product page )
System requirements : Windows 2000 or Windows XP , PC with USB 2.0 port
Price : $ 249 ( shop for the Zune )
Let 's get one thing clear at the start : the Zune is a beautiful music player and the entire ecosystem trumps anything devised by a PlaysforSure licensee .
But Microsoft is n't satisfied with showing up its own partners ; it wants a piece of Apple pie .
The signs are everywhere .
The business model was borrowed from Apple , the headphones were borrowed from Apple , and the click wheel does n't resemble an iPod scroll wheel for nothing .
How far does the copying go ?
Every Apple product bears the phrase " Designed by Apple in California . "
On the back of every Zune , in tiny gray type , Microsoft has their own version of this line .
It says : " Hello from Seattle . "
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
Now we will destroy you .
How well does the new device stack up to the old favorite ?
Let 's take a look inside the box .
The out of box experience
Could the Zune come in cooler packaging ?
Probably , but the sheer hipness of such a thing would blind the average geek .
Microsoft has learned all sorts of lessons from Apple , including the importance of the initial " out of box " experience .
The Zune packaging is lavish : a superbly designed two - piece cardboard box that feels substantial in the hand and just begs to be pulled open .
When it is , the Zune tagline is revealed : " Welcome to the social . "
Beneath this lid lies the player itself , along with headphones and a sync cable .
Instruction cards ( calling them " manuals " would be an insult to true manuals everywhere ) , a carrying pouch , and a decal are all included in a separate compartment on the back of the box .
For a product targeted squarely at high school and college students , the inclusion of the decal is a curious choice .
Where , exactly , do high school and college students stick decals from their portable music players ?
On their Trapper Keepers™ ?
" The social " was n't as welcoming as I would have liked , though .
Upon pulling the Zune out of its cardboard case , lifting it out of its plastic baggie , and peeling the protector from its screen ( this thing comes well protected ) , I did what any self - respecting new gadget owner would do : ditch the manual and fire up the new toy .
When that three - inch screen burst to life , I thought to myself , " Self , you have got to give credit to Microsoft for a great out - of - box experience . "
And that 's when it crashed .
Was it a sign of things to come ?
Read on to find out ...
Test system
Missed this a couple of days ago :
Two weeks ago , the Bush administration organized an intelligence briefing for journalists in Iraq to demonstrate that Iran was providing weapons to Iraqi insurgents .
According to the anonymous briefers , the weapons -- particularly explosively formed penetrators or E.F.P.s -- were manufactured in Iran and provided to insurgents by the Quds Force -- a fact that meant direction for the operation was “ coming from the highest levels of the Iranian government . ”
Well .
A raid in southern Iraq on Saturday seems to have complicated the case .
There , The Wall Street Journal reports ( sub. req. ) , troops " uncovered a makeshift factory used to construct advanced roadside bombs that the U.S. had thought were made only in Iran . "
The main feature of the find were several copper liners that are the main component of EFPs .
But , The New York Times reports , " while the find gave experts much more information on the makings of the E.F.P.’s , which the American military has repeatedly argued must originate in Iran , the cache also included items that appeared to cloud the issue . "
Among those cloudy items were " cardboard boxes of the gray plastic PVC tubes used to make the canisters .
The boxes appeared to contain shipments of tubes directly from factories in the Middle East , none of them in Iran . "
このページの情報は既にかなり古いです。私は現在あまり使っていませんし、追ってもいないのでこのページの情報が更新されることはあまり期待できないのでなるべく本家の情報なりを見た方がよいでしょう。2009年8月現在だと
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/tech-kazuhisa/20090816/1250432286
とかで似たような情報をあつかってるみたいです。検索しても結構上にまだくるっぽいのでいちおう追記しておきました。
次回の第8 回Rails勉強会＠東京でセッション案に上がっていたBackgrounDRbというやつがなにやら面白そげなので調べてみた。
調べてみた感じ以下のページがよくまとまっている。
http://www.infoq.com/articles/BackgrounDRb
以下、この内容を大雑把に要約してみる。
Ruby on Railsは素晴らしいフレームワークですが 、Webアプリケーションをどんどん拡張していくと、バックグラウンドで長い時間処理するようなタスクが必要になってくることがあります。このような処理をControllerとかに書いてしまうとWebサーバーの動作の妨げになります。Webサーバーをタイムアウトさせずにこれらの処理を手軽に行なえるようにしたRailsのプラグインがBackgrounDRbです。
BackgrounDRbサーバーはMiddleManオブジェクトを配信します。このオブジェクトはworkerクラスを管理します。このオブジェクトは
@jobs = {job_key => running_worker_object}
@timestamps = { job_key => timestamp }
というインスタンス変数を持ちます。MiddleManオブジェクトはDRbサーバーとRailsアプリケーションの仲立役として機能します。（ここら辺にある図は見ておいた方が良さそう。）
インストールは次のように行います。
script / plugin install svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/backgroundrb
Pluginをインストールすると、generatorにworkerジェネレータが使えるようになります。
$ script / generate worker Foo class FooWorker < BackgrounDRb:: Rails def do_works ( args ) end end
MiddleManオブジェクトを通じてRailsからFooWorkerオブジェクトがインスタンス化されると、do_worksメソッドが自動的にRailsとは独立したスレッドで動作します。そのため、Railsはdo_worksメソッドが終了するのを待たずに先に進めます。
BackgrounDRbを使えば、Ajaxリクエストを使うと新しいworkerオブジェクトを生成します。このとき、Viewではperiodically_call_remoteメソッドを利用すればジョブの進行状況を取得し、どうなっているか表示することが出来ます。FooWorkerオブジェクトを生成し、RailsのControllerから進行状況を表示するコードを以下に示します。
class FooWorker < BackgrounDRb:: Rails attr_reader : progress def do_work ( args ) @progress = 0 calculate_the_meaning_of_life(args ) end def calculate_the_meaning_of_life( args ) while @progress < 100 # ここで計算します @progress += 1 end end end
コントローラは以下のようにします。
class MyController < ApplicationController # FooWorkerを起動するクラス def start_background_task session [ : job_key ] = MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => : foo_worker , :args => " do_workメソッドに渡される引数 " ) # 追記 「 ) 」が抜けておりました。お試しになった方申し訳ありません。 end # 進行状況を表示するクラス def get_progress if request.xhr ?
progress_percent = MiddleMan.get_worker(session [ : job_key ] ) .
progress render : update do |page| page.call('progressPercent ' , ' progressbar ' , progress_percent ) page.redirect_to(:action => ' done ' ) if progress_percent >= 100 end else redirect_to :action => ' index ' end end # タスクが終わったときに表示するメソッド def done render : text =>
" FooWorker task has completed " MiddleMan.delete_worker(session [ : job_key ] ) end end
start_background_task.rhtmlはpage.call('progressPercent ' , ' progressbar ' , progress_percent ) が実行されたとき のViewを指定します。*1
< html > < head > < style type =" text /css " > . progress { width : 1 px ; height : 16 px ; color : white ; font - size : 12 px ; overflow : hidden ; background - color : # 287B7E ; padding - left : 5 px ; } </style > <%= javascript_include_tag : defaults %><!-- 本家にもないので注意！ --> < script type =" text / javascript " > function progressPercent ( bar , percentage ) { document.getElementById( bar).style.width = parseInt ( percentage * 2 ) + " px " ; document.getElementById(bar).innerHTML= " < div align= ' center ' > " + percentage + " %</div > " } </ script > </head > < body > < div id='progressbar ' class= " progress " ></div > <%= periodically_call_remote(:url => {:action => ' get_progress'} , : frequency => 1 ) %> </ body > </html >
MiddleMan.new_workerメソッドはランダムなジョブキーを持つジョブを作成し、あとからセッションに格納します。ジョブキーに特定の名前を付けたい場合は以下のようにします。
MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => : foo_worker , : job_key => : my_worker , :args => " do_workerメソッドの引数 " )
MiddleMan.get_worker :my_worker
BackgrounDRbの設定はRAILS_ROOT/config/backgroundrb.ymlで行います。load_railsオプションをtrueに設定すると、workerクラスにActiveRecordオブジェクトを使うことが出来ます。BackgrounDRbサーバーを起動する際にdatabase.ymlの情報を読んでデータベースに接続します。
このプラグイン はActiveRecordのオブジェクトを含む巨大なオブジェクトをキャッシュする機能があります。レンダリングされたViewや巨大なクエリもMarshallダンプできるオブジェクトであれば何でもキャッシングすることが出来ます。以下のようにして行います。
# キャッシュするには次の2通りのやり方がある @posts = Post.find ( : all , : include => : comments ) MiddleMan.cache_as( : post_cache , @posts ) @posts = MiddleMan.cache_as : post_cache do Post.find ( : all , : include => : comments ) end # 次のようにしてキャッシュを取り出す @posts = Middleman.cache_get ( : post_cache ) @posts = MiddleMan.cache_get ( : post_cache ) { Post.find ( : all , : include => : comments ) }
MiddleMan.cache_getがブロックをとるかとらないかは:post_cacheキーが存在しないときにnilを返すか、ブロックを実行するかである。
現在の実装だと役目を終えたworkerオブジェクトやキャッシュは手動で無効にしてやる必要がある。これにはMiddleMan.delete_worker(:job_key)
とMiddleMan.delete_cache(:cache_key)を使う。Timeオブジェクトを取り、それよりもタイムスタンプが古ければ削除するというMiddleMan.gc!メソッドもある。次の例は、30分前のジョブは無効にするスクリプトである。これをcronで定期的に実行することで残った不要なジョブを自動的に消すことが出来る
#!/usr/bin/env ruby require ' drb ' DRb.start_service MiddleMan = DRbObject.new(nil , " druby://localhost:22222 " ) MiddleMan.gc!( Time.now - 60 * 30 )
将来的にはオブジェクトを作成したときにGCが実行される時間をスケジュールしておけるようにするつもりのようです。

th
Nobody had better bring me this shit .
No email forwards , no suggestions over lunch , no " hey , I just thought you maybe wanted to , I do n't know , improve your life or something ... "
The Secret just smells like something I 'm going to hear about far more than I want to .
But let me impart the thing that makes this dangerous and evil .
It 's from a Newsweek interview with the author , Rhonda , so far so good .
Again , this does n't sound bad .
Here 's the thing : Rhondasaid this in response to a question about how villagers could have avoided being massacred in Rwanda .
Oh yeah she did .
She just said that fifty children barricaded into a school then burned alive could have avoided their fate through positive thinking .
She just said that half a million people who were shot and chopped up by machetes , often killed by their own neighbors , could have avoided death by thinking their way out of it .
From Rwandan genocide to the solution to the American waistline .
I love the " many tough things " in quotes up there .
Normally this bullshit would n't even be on my radar .
It would be a little blip that I would listen to politely while my folks drone on about it .
Well I 'm not taking it if it ever does come .
This lady is now on My List , along with Pauloand , to a much lesser extent , Richard Ford : the List of people who not only mean well , who not only think that they 're doing good , but who have legions of followers and apologists surrounding them and enabling to lead them further into ignorance .
You do n't just cast off genocide .
You do n't compare trying to get down to 116 pounds to hacking off the arms of small children whose " ethnic classification " is slightly different from your own .
And , aside from that madness , here 's why Marcus does n't want to hear about yet another pat answer to everything , another simple solution to all of life 's problems :
Life is complicated .
I like it that way .
Leave me the hell alone about it , because even though you may all be right and it would actually make my life better , I love my life the way it is already .
It 'll get rid of my problems ?
Fuck you , I like my problems .
I like my problems and I like myand I like my outlook on life .
I like the way I handle my problems .
Literature is my self - help .
Reading about a man who sprouts horns after falling from the sky , or about a woman who becomes lost in the Saharan desert but finds herself in better company than when she was back home , or about the 16 president of the United States who had his own problems : all of these things help me to look at the world from a lens other than my own .
This fresh hell is the same garbage we 've been getting since phrenology , since bloodletting , or more recently , since What the $ #*!
Do We Know ?
Quantum physics my ass .
Believe , do n't believe , just keep it the hell away from me .
No debates , no contradictions , no " but do n't you think - - " .
None of it .
Read a fucking book written by someone who actually has something to say .
Then we can talk .

In 1930 the British economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that the biggest problem facing future generations would be what to do with all their leisure time .
Well , here we are in Keynes ’s future :
Where is that leisure we were promised ?
Though the average hours at work have certainly decreased in the last century , it does n’t necessarily follow that leisure has increased , since nonlabor time is not necessarily leisure .
Any attempt to compare changes in leisure over long periods of time has to confront some tricky issues of definition .
The most recent attempt to examine long - term trends in leisure is by two economists , Valerie A. Ramey of the University of California , San Diego , and Neville Francis of the University of North Carolina .
Next time you get a chance , you can download the paper from http://www.econ.ucsd.edu/~vramey/research/Historical_Hours.pdf.But if you never find the time , it ’s no wonder .
According to Ms. Ramey and Mr. Francis , the amount of leisure time per capita has n’t changed much in the last 105 years .
Since this view is at odds with a number of other studies , it is worth going over their analysis to see how they reach this somewhat surprising conclusion .

Grouse Grep
Grouse Grep is a program that searches for a target string or regular expression pattern in one or more files .
It features stunning performance for many common search cases , often outstripping GNU Grep or any other grep for speed .
However , at present the program only handles basic regular expressions , and may be much slower when handling more complicated searches .
There are over 10,000 lines of C code in Grouse Grep , and around another 8,000 lines in supporting scripts and test rig files .
Finding your way through this body of work can be daunting .
This web shows how the program is split into modules , and documents much of the analysis and design that went into the construction of each component that is not always easy to see in the code .
The original announcement message may help provide an introduction to the program and this web .
A Map of the Code
Behind The Scenes
There 's a lot more to Grouse Grep than meets the eye .
Here you 'll find detailed tutorials on the major architectures and algorithms used in the code .
The design and coding style topic is perhaps a little self - indulgent , but contains lots and lots of information about how I design and code programs , and may be of interest ( it 's even controversial in places ! )
Other bits and pieces about Grouse Grep are also presented here .
The test rig is particularly interesting :
It 's a fully - automated regression and flog test rig which is easily expandable .
Download
You can download the source code for Grouse Grep ( tar / gzipped ) from the Grouse FTP site ggrep - 2.00.tar.gz .
The FTP Archive contains other related files , and also the earlier DOS versions released as part of the DDJ publication ( from November 1997 ) .
Two years ago most Britons did n't have broadband and Web 2.0 was barely a twinkle in a developer 's eye .
Things have changed - as our cream of the crop for 2006 shows
In 2004 , the internet was a different place : there was , for example , no YouTube , and most Britons online did n't have broadband .
That 's changed dramatically : now , more than 75 % of users have broadband , and the arrival of Web 2.0 has brought sites where the interaction is as fast as if it were on your machine .
So we 've revisited the " cream of the crop " that we brought you two years ago .
Some of the crop is brand new ; some has stood the test of time .
As before , we have 100 sites in 20 categories .
That of course means that your favourite might not be here ( even if you suggested it on our blog ) .
Email us with your suggestions for the ones we should have included .
Many of the categories here are new since the last crop .
Many of the sites from that time still exist , of course - and are still hugely useful .
One category that 's missing is mobiles , where data speeds have n't kept up with broadband .
Maybe in 2007 ?

Applications
Why have an application to run in your browser ?
Because for tasks shared between people at different locations , it makes sense to access password - protected sets of work .
37 signals offers Backpack ( note the domain is backpackit ) for simple tasks and the bigger Basecamp for grown - up projects .
Tadalist is simpler , being just to - dos ( but is n't that what it 's about ? ) , while Google 's Documents & Spreadsheets requires a Google account ( they 're free ) and does n't try to compete with Microsoft Office .
Wikicalc is a free online spreadsheet , and developing smartly .

Blogs : reading
There are millions of blogs out there ; you need to pick the best .
Step forward RSS ( aka web feeds ) and blog search engines to simplify things .
Technorati is occasionally flaky , but generally a reliable indicator of what 's being blogged about .
Icerocket runs it close .
And you 'll need an online aggregator to keep abreast of the feeds you 're most interested in : Newsgator and Google Reader are good choices .
Bloglines is an excellent alternative feed reader .

Blogs : writing
To do it rather than read it , you need a good set of tools .
The open - source and free software project Wordpress has risen to prominence , elbowing aside many rivals with its blog creation , management and ( importantly ) spam - beating tools .
Wordpress.org is the free software ; wordpress.com offers paid - for , managed versions of the free package .
Blogger is the best of the rest ;
Vox is neat , easy and free , and plugs into lots of social applications .
Statcounter counts , well , statistics for your site ; the free Google Analytics ( if you can get an account ) is good too .

Email
Google 's Gmail has become the web - based email system of choice for those who can get access .
Its main drawback is that it 's still an invitation - only system in the UK .
However , Yahoo's free email service is a decent competitor , and Microsoft has Live Mail .
Unlike Microsoft 's old Hotmail service , none will delete all your old emails if you fail to log on every 30 days .
Among the dozens of free alternatives , Bluebottle is a decent option for its focus on spam filtering .
The free version offers 250MB of storage and supports the POP3 and SMTP standards , so you can use a proper email program as well as web access .
There 's also TempInbox , which provides free , temporary , throwaway email accounts with no registration .

Gaming
There are far too many videogame news sites on the internet today ; you need an aggregator like Gametab to filter through to the best .
Pocketgamer specialises in handheld games , while Gamasutra is absolutely unmissable .
Gamesfaqs has FAQs and walkthroughs ( plus cheats , reviews and previews ) for loads of games .
And the ESRB lets you search by age rating .

Maps
Maps matter , but once you 're past Google 's maps and satellite detail , everyone 's thrown back on the Ordnance Survey 's data , which means there 's little to choose between them .
Ordnance Survey has improved its site , and can at least now tell you which map to buy for an area ; its placename search is nifty .
Meanwhile , the New Popular Edition site shows how the country looked in the 1940s .
Delightful .

News : mainstream
The BBC marches on , adding more media forms while also letting users add their comments .
The New York Times site is vast ( though it has shut off some of its content behind a " paywall " ) .
Both sites ' ( short ) RSS feeds can be read on a mobile at bbcriver.com and nytimesriver.com .
Google News extends its reach , though the top headline is still whichever site last updated rather than the one which is most accurate .
Nowpublic is a US rival to OhMyNews and claims 52,000 ( and counting ) " mojos " - amateur journalists with mobile phones whose location can be figured out from GPS or phone triangulation .

News : recommendation
One thing that Web 2.0 is really good at is letting lots of people vote on things .
It can be ( and is ) abused , but generally the system works .
That 's seen the rise of sites which let people vote stories up , or which news stories ( and how ) bloggers are talking about ( at memoerandum ) .
The biggest is Digg , which overtook Slashdot earlier this year .
Reddit was recently bought by Wired magazine .
Findory is slightly different , learning what you like the more you use it .

Offbeat
Snopes checks out unbelievable tales , scams and urban legends and debunks ( or confirms ) them .
Slightly less useful is the 100 - strong webring of Unusual Museums of the Internet .
These include the Virtual Toilet Paper Museum , the Old Calculators Web Museum and Signalfan 's museum of traffic control signals .
You can find links to lots of other offbeat sites via the Weird Site 's Other Weird Links page .
The Onion is the web 's leading satire magazine , though with an American bias .
Otherwise , for five minutes of fun , try browsing B3ta .
This UK site sends out a weekly newsletter of cool links and runs a message board where people post amusingly manipulated pictures .
But be warned : it 's often offensive - that 's part of the point - and most definitely rated NSFW ( Not Safe For Work ) .

Politics
The MySociety team remains unbeatable for turning Hansard inside out with Theyworkforyou and Publicwhip , but bloggers have begun to expose the unwritten workings of politicians to greater public scrutiny too .
Guido Fawkes ' blog has the inside gossip from Westminster , while NO2ID agitates on arguably the most important political and technological issue around , while NHS 23 is a wiki outlining the problems with the political , technological and medical drama of the NHS computer - isation programme .

Public action
Now , it 's time to bug someone in power .
The idea that the web can make a difference is growing ; politicians are on the web and there 's an online petition site at No.10 .
Pledgebank and HearfromyourMP are both part of the excellent MySociety ( mysociety.org ) family of sites enabling citizens to connect to decision - makers - and , one would hope , vice versa .
Netaction includes The Virtual Activist , a manual for anyone looking to build and promote a cause online .

Radio
Radio now travels over wires , at least to our homes .
The BBC dominates here , but there are thousands of stations to choose from .
AOL's Shoutcast is interesting : find whatever 's on right now ( you can tune in via iTunes or any internet radio - enabled player . )
Radio - locator and Live - radio list broadcasters worldwide , so you can find something new to listen to .
Reciva does the same , but if you buy its internet radio you can add your own favourites online and they show on the gadget ; or just listen online .

Recommendation : music
Another new category : being able to find stuff that 's similar to music you like is increasingly important , both to listeners and to record companies trying to profit from niches .
Last.fm requires an application that runs on your machine , and shows what other people with the same music like .
Pandora says you need a US postcode ; so give it one , then enjoy its expert - chosen stations .
Liveplasma can search relationships in films as well as music .
Tuneglue is a relatively new venture between last.fm and EMI , using data from Amazon and last .
fm .
Goombah requires a small download and only works on music in an iTunes library , but has been at it for some time .

Reference
Wikipedia now dominates the reference side of the web , partly because its pages are ranked so highly in Google .
User - written , it 's not always reliable , but is usually a good place to start .
It competes with the Encyclopedia Britannica , which is n't free .
However , another traditional alternative is the HighBeam Encyclopedia , which searches more than 57,000 articles from the Columbia Encyclopedia .
Otherwise Jim Martindale 's Reference Desk , started in 1994 , provides an astonishing collection of links to reference sources .
For words , try Onelook , which indexes more than 7.5 m words in 931 dictionaries .
It also has a reverse lookup to find words from their meanings .
Finally , Teldir ( on the infobel site ) has links to the world 's online phone books .

Science
Alphagalileo gives a view of public - facing science in Europe and is a counterpart to eurekalert , the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's press announcements forum .
Space.com remains fascinating for all things spacey .
Nasa contains a wealth of information .
The growing importance of climate change makes the RealClimate blog written by climate change scientists important .

Search
Google continues to tighten its grip on our hunt for information ( it now gets half of all searches ) but that does n't necessarily mean it 's the best .
Search can now encompass your hard drive , blogs ( a separate category - see above ) , images , peer - to - peer and even what used to be out there .
Blinkx remains unique with its focus on video , while Ask ( now without Jeeves ) has made great strides recently , though it only gets a tiny portion of searches .

Social software
The browser has grown up : now it 's the path to meeting people of similar interests and creating your own personal space online in a shared area .
Social networks have become a cliche , but that has n't stopped MySpace becoming the biggest site online .
Bebo is popular , Habbo is more tuned to the kids , while Friendster and Linked In will appeal to the older user .

Video
The crowds are all over at YouTube , the poster child of online video ( a category too niche to merit mention two years ago ; YouTube was founded in February 2005 ) .
But it 's not the only place to find video .
Revver offers a revenue - sharing system ( people pay to watch your video , you get some cash ) .
You can also start your own TV station at brightcove and currenttv .
And Videojug has demonstrations of how to do lots of possibly useful tasks .

Virtual worlds
The key distinction from social sites like MySpace is that virtual worlds give you an avatar - your representation of yourself in the online world .
The advent of broadband allied to faster machines has made them usable .
When the BBC held a concert in Second Life , it seemed like an anomaly ; then IBM 's chief executive got an avatar , and suddenly everyone 's there .
Habbo Hotel is booming with teens .
World of Warcraft has millions of users ; Everquest , its own culture .
Or you can play the Sims online .
Whether an influx of new users will make these worlds more antisocial remains open .

Understanding how Apple ’s FairPlay DRM works helps to answer a lot of questions : why it has n’t been replaced with an open , interoperable DRM that anyone can use , why Apple is n’t broadly licensing FairPlay , and why the company has n’t jumped to add DRM - free content from indie artists to iTunes .
The Quandary of Interoperable DRM
Why can't the music industry just adopt an open standard for DRM ?
The simple answer is that the basic concept of interoperable DRM makes no sense .
Since the point of DRM is to limit interoperability by using secrets , there is no open way to deliver a DRM system that does what it 's supposed to do .
If it were open , then it would n't be secret .
When the secrets get out , it 's now open , but it no longer works as DRM .
If that logic is n’t too difficult to fathom , here 's another wrinkle to complicate things : the industry has already adopted interoperable frameworks for DRM .
One is the MPEG - 4 AAC standard , which is used by Apple in iTunes .
The earlier MP3 file format had no provision for DRM .
However , the newer AAC format was designed with an open mechanism for companies to extend the format using their own DRM implementation .
That 's as open as DRM can possibly get : an agreed upon system for putting secrets in a specific place .
It 's still a secret , but it 's at least a known unknown .
While anyone can access and play a standard AAC file , to use a DRM - protected AAC file they need to know the secret to decoding that particular file .
Advanced Audio Coding
AAC was developed by some of the same audio experts that created the original MP3 standard : the Fraunhofer Institute , Dolby , Sony , and AT&T .
It was adopted as an open standard a decade ago this year , although it has been updated and expanded since .
Royalty payments are required for using the MP3 format for distributed content , but no licenses or fees are required to stream or distribute content in AAC , making it a more attractive format for streaming content , such as Internet radio .
AAC also offers better compression , support for more channels of audio , and requires less processing power to decode than MP3 .
By default , iTunes rips songs from CD using AAC .
Most modern devices , from media players to mobile phones , can now play AAC sound files .
In addition to iTunes , AAC has also been adopted by Sony for use on the PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3 , and many other music players beyond the iPod .
It 's also the format used by XM satellite radio and most digital satellite TV , part of the MPEG 4 standard and adopted by the 3GPP , the partnership creating media standards for 3G mobile GSM networks .
An Enigma , Wrapped in a Riddle , Shrouded in Mystery
The AAC songs purchased from the iTunes music store are protected with Apple ’s FairPlay DRM .
Without knowing the FairPlay secrets , other parties can't play them .
In order to create a system that could manage access to billions of songs sold to millions of users , yet keep things simple and flexible , FairPlay uses sets of keys that work together to make sure that the system , even if it is cracked , still maintains Apple 's commitment to music labels by limiting any damages .
A look at how FairPlay works helps to understand why Apple does n't want to share the system with third party download stores and player manufacturers , and what would be involved in mixing DRM - free content into the iTunes Store .
iTunes Accounts and Authorizations
Prior to buying content from the iTunes Store , a user has to create an account with Apple 's servers and then authorize a PC or Mac running iTunes .
During authorization , iTunes creates a globally unique ID number for the computer it is running on , then sends it to Apple 's servers , where it is assigned to the user 's iTunes account .
Five different machines can be authorized .
When a user buys a song from the iTunes Store , a user key is created for the purchased file .
The AAC song itself is scrambled using a separate master key , which is then included into the protected AAC song file .
The master key is locked using the user key , which is both held by iTunes and also sent to Apple ’s servers .
Protected , purchased content is locked within iTunes ; songs are not scrambled on Apple 's server .
This speeds and simplifies the transaction by delegating that work to iTunes on the local computer .
The result is an authorization system that does not require iTunes to verify each song with Apple as it plays .
Instead , iTunes maintains a collection of user keys for all the purchased tracks in its library .
To play a protected AAC song , iTunes uses the matching user key to unlock the master key stored within the song file , when is then used to unscramble the song data .
Every time a new track is purchased , a new user key may be created ; those keys are all encrypted and stored on the authorized iTunes computer , as well as being copied to Apple 's servers .
When a new computer is authorized , it also generates a globally unique ID number for itself and sends it to Apple , which stores it as one of the five authorizations in the user account .
Apple 's server sends the newly authorized machine the entire set of user keys for all the tracks purchased under the account , so all authorized systems will be able to play all purchased songs .
An iTunes computer can be authorized by multiple iTunes user accounts ; for each account , iTunes maintains a set of user keys .
Exploiting Authorizations in FairPlay
When a computer is deauthorized , it deletes its local set of user keys and requests Apple to remove the authorization from its records .
If the keys are backed up , users can deauthorize their systems , then restore the keys and authorize a new set of computers , resulting in more than five machines that can all play the existing purchased music .
However , any new music purchased on the newly authorized systems will create new keys , and the previously de-authorized machines will not be able to play the new purchases because they can't obtain the new keys .
iTunes Keys on the iPod
Any number of iPods can be used with an authorized computer running iTunes .
Once an iPod is connected , it downloads all the user keys from iTunes so it can unlock and play any protected tracks .
If that copy of iTunes is authorized to play songs from multiple accounts , all of the accounts ' user keys are uploaded .
The iPod makes no decisions about which tracks it can play , it simply is given user keys for all the songs it contains by iTunes .
If iTunes has songs in its library , but lacks the keys to play them -- from another account , or on a deauthorized computer that has dumped its keys -- it will simply not copy the protected songs to the iPod .
There is no way unplayable protected songs can be copied to the iPod without the user keys to play them , because iTunes will not let this happen .
This again delegates the burden of DRM to iTunes , making the iPod simpler .
That also explains why users can't dock a single iPod with different users ’
iTunes and suck up all their music ; the only option available is to replace the music on the iPod with the music from the new iTunes library .
Since iTunes manages all the music on an iPod , there is no way to sync an iPod with multiple iTunes libraries ; the iPod simply was n’t given the intelligence to mange multiple libraries .
With iTunes 7 however , Apple added the ability for an iPod registered with an iTunes account to sync purchased songs with any of the five machines authorized by that account .
Each copy of iTunes can update the user keys on the iPod and add new purchased tracks , ensuring that the iPod can play all the music copied to it .
Cracking FairPlay in iTunes
Because protected AAC songs are scrambled with an encrypted master key , it is practically impossible to unscramble protected song files .
Instead , crackers typically attempt to steal the user keys so they can simply decrypt songs in the same matter as iTunes does .
This is like breaking into a bank vault by stealing the combination rather than trying to smash through the vault walls .
The user keys themselves are stored encrypted by iTunes , on the iPod , and on Apple 's server .
However , as the keys are used there are opportunities to either steal them or hijack the song data after it is unlocked .
In either case , the unlocked song can be recovered and dumped into an unlocked file .
Jon Johansen , known as DVDJon for his involvement in cracking the Content Scrambling System DRM used on DVDs , discovered multiple methods for stripping the encryption from FairPlay protected files while working to build an iTunes client for Linux :
• The first , distributed as QTFairUse , grabbed song data after it was unlocked and uncompressed by iTunes , and then dumped the raw stream into a large container file , requiring further processing afterward .
• The second , written by Johansen for the open source VLC media player -- and reused in PlayFair , Hymn , JHymn and other derivatives -- intercepts unlocked but not yet uncompressed song files , creating a small , ready to play , unencrypted AAC file .
• The third , originally used in PyMusique , a Linux client for the iTunes Store , pretends to be iTunes .
It requested songs from Apple 's servers and then downloaded the purchased songs without locking them , as iTunes would .
• The fourth , used in FairKeys , also pretends to be iTunes ; it requests a user 's keys from Apple 's servers and then uses these keys to unlock existing purchased songs .
All of these exploits only work on song of a specific , known user account .
They will not work against protected tracks obtained from an unknown user .
FairPlay encryption has never been cracked to the point where anyone can open up any encrypted content , in the way that the CSS DRM on DVDs has .
Because iTunes happily converts protected AAC songs into standard , unprotected AAIF CD files when burning a CD , there is n't much point for a user trying to attack the system or steal its keys .
The main reason for trying to defeat FairPlay is to exploit the system for the benefit of third parties .
RealNetworks and the Rhapsody Attack
The most obvious example is Real 's attempt to sell its own DRM music that could play on the iPod .
Since Real 's own Helix DRM does not work on the iPod , Real created software that decrypts its own DRM music , then encodes it in a FairPlay - like package that could play on the iPod with DRM intact .
Apple responded by issuing a bizarre statement saying it was " stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod , " and then threatened to drop the DMCA bomb .
After that excessive posturing , Apple did what it should have done silently : it simply disabled Real tracks from playing .
Since then , Apple and Real have squabbled back and forth , but since Apple controls the whole FairPlay system , it has had little problem in preventing Real 's DRM from working on the iPod .
Jon Johansen , DRM Profiteer
After releasing a number of open source utilities to strip the DRM from FairPlay protected songs , Johansen decided that it would be more advantageous to get paid for his work .
He now works for DoubleTwist Ventures , selling third parties the ability to sell DRM music that can play on the iPod , just like Real had been trying to do itself .
Apple has worked tirelessly to stop attempts by Real , DoubleTwist , and Johansen 's open source software to defeat its FairPlay system .
Is the company worried about losing revenue to Real and other store competitors ?
Well , since Apple makes very little direct revenue from iTunes Store purchases , that 's not likely .
After all , the company provides free podcast content in iTunes ; if Apple were desperately trying to get revenue out of the iTunes Store , it would be foolish to promote free alternative content .
Microsoft has made no effort to foster any support for podcasts on the Zune for example .
Why Apple Cares About DRM
The real impetus behind blocking FairPlay cracks is that Apple has to answer to the labels it licenses its music from ; if Apple allows crackers to break the system and recover songs , it has to pay damages to the RIAA .
Apple obviously does n't want to pay for damages , nor does it really want to continue developing an increasingly sophisticated DRM system under constant attack from smart crackers armed with financial incentives to exploit it .
The only reason Apple maintains FairPlay is to preserve access to licensed content from the music labels for the iPod and the Mac , QuickTime , and iTunes platforms .
Why Apple Does n't Care About DRM
Foes of DRM have joined with foes of Apple to beat the company up over its efforts to keep FairPlay secure .
That 's why Steve Jobs announced that the company would be happy to drop its DRM efforts , if only the labels would agree to license their music for sale in iTunes without DRM .
After years of negotiating with the RIAA , Jobs ' probably knows that the labels are unlikely to give up their DRM demands .
His comments really serve to point out that Apple benefits little from DRM , a rebuttal of the attacks from EU regulators that claim Apple ’s FairPlay gives it a monopoly and restricts free trade .
As Jobs pointed out , the majority of music is being sold on CDs , and lacks any sort of DRM protection .
As long as CDs are sold , it makes little sense for the labels to demand that iTunes sells music with unbreakable DRM , while EU regulators also chime in to demand that Apple share its DRM system with rivals .
Two birds , one stone .
Jobs basically told the EU to bark up the record labels ’ tree , which happens to be rooted in their own backyard .
If the labels allowed Apple to sell music without DRM , the iPod and iTunes Store could only become more popular .
Even if download sales crashed because of rampant piracy , the only real loss would be the labels ’ , who take the vast majority of revenues from download sales .
If sales went up , Apple would do even better .
There is really no way Apple would lose from abandoning DRM , unless doing so would cause the labels to pull out of the iTunes Store and try to resurrect Real 's Helix or Microsoft 's Janus as an alternative DRM system instead .
That ’s the threat posed by allowing competitors to sell DRM that works on the iPod .
As long as the playing field is level , Apple can compete .
If Real were allowed to sell iPod - playable DRM , or if the iPod supported Microsoft ’s Janus DRM , suddenly Apple would be competing against label - friendly DRM and lose any leverage .
Apple is n’t a fan of DRM because as long as it is accepted , the potential exists for the Mac , iPod , iTunes , and QuickTime to be shut out of the market by an industry ready to drink Bill Gates ’ Palladium FlavorAid .
At the same time , Apple obviously can't just turn off its DRM and sell the labels ’ songs unencumbered without their blessing .
Is there any middle ground ?
Apple ’s Problem With DRM
A number of analysts have frothed all over themselves to call Jobs a lying hypocrite , saying that if Jobs did n't secretly love DRM , he 'd offer songs in iTunes without DRM right now .
There are labels and independents willing to sell their music without DRM .
Anti-DRM frothers have praised Yahoo ! for making a spectacle of offering a few tracks from select artists as MP3s .
Indeed , why ca n’t Apple be like Yahoo ! and offer a handful of unprotected songs with limited appeal ?
The reason Yahoo ! is talking about MP3s is because its PlaysForSure business does n’t get much attention .
Apple does n’t have the same problem , so it does n’t need to make a meaningless show about offering a dozen MP3s .
The reason that Jobs is n't interested in DRM is not because of a desperate need for attention , nor a religious fervor for open sharing and caring , but rather because DRM only poses a risk and expense to Apple , with negligible benefit .
Adding some DRM - free content to iTunes fails to solve the problem .
FairPlay ’s Negligible Benefit to Apple
FairPlay may make PlaysForSure - based products from Creative and other Microsoft aligned rivals slightly less appealing because they " wo n't work with iTunes , " but since those players work fine with CDs and have stores of their own , the real reason nobody 's buying them is not because of the DRM in the iTunes Store .
PC enthusiasts like to complain that iTunes for Windows does n’t even work very well , so when they complain that the majority of the market is hopelessly and inextricably tied to iTunes , well , it makes a for a good laugh .
Any slight competitive edge afforded to the iPod by Apple 's FairPlay DRM is vastly overshadowed by the development expense and risk Apple incurs supporting a DRM system that only really benefits the RIAA .
So why is n't Apple jumping to adopt DRM - free indie content , to prove to its partner music labels that DRM is unnecessary to support sales ?
John Gruber of the Daring Fireball seems to feel that the problem is one of labeling and consumer confusion .
As he points out , Apple already marks content in the iTunes Store as " clean " or " explicit , " so why not sell music as " unencumbered " or " FairPlay , " and let users decide ?
Why iTunes Can't Mix DRM and non-DRM Content
The real answer seems to be simpler : the iTunes Store is designed to manage purchases along with their keys .
Offering DRM - free tracks next to protected songs in the iTunes Store would require significant changes to how iTunes works , and could inadvertently open up new exploits to the remaining DRM system , complicating the system further .
The real rub is that it would do nothing to solve Apple ’s real problem .
Apple wants things to be simpler and more efficient , not to offer DRM - free indie tracks next to DRM songs .
Duh .
Apple is n't professing a lack of interest in DRM as a ruse to court the favor of DRM - haters , nor is it an ideological exercise in being free - content hippies .
The company just does n’t want to be burdened with maintaining a system that is complex , expensive to maintain and police , and which threatens to expose Apple to risk .
As long as the majority of music is being sold on wide - open , unprotected CDs , FairPlay DRM really serves little purpose beyond giving the RIAA members a false sense of security .
If CDs were copy protected , DRM would make more sense as a tool in managing loss .
Making Things Worse
Mixing non-DRM music into iTunes does nothing to solve Apple 's problem , it only complicates matters .
Apple would have to update the iTunes software so it could download songs and skip encryption and key storage for non-DRM tracks .
Apple would also have to rework its servers to manage purchased tracks without dealing with keys .
It would also have to update the iPod to manage purchased track syncing without trying to use keys .
It would then need to spend time making sure all those changes did n’t introduce bugs or exploitable vulnerabilities in FairPlay .
That 's a lot of engineering work to create a system that duplicates the effort of existing stores that already offer the minority of tracks available as MP3s .
There simply is n't a large enough demand for the indie music available on MP3 ; that ’s also why it is not popular enough to be carried by the big pop labels .
Whose Idea Was This ?
If Apple were making huge profits from selling music , it might make sense .
However , Apple sells music in the iTunes Store to make sure content is available for the iPod .
Apple knows there ’s no big profits in reselling music .
If online music stores were making money , the world ’s number two store would n't be an outfit selling MP3s of artists that the big five labels wo n't even carry .
Besides the iTunes Store , which is only earning a small profit , there are no significant , profitable online stores selling popular music .
That 's simply a fact : selling other people 's music is a low profit business for everyone apart from the big labels .
Until they choose to sell their music without DRM , it makes no sense for Apple to outdo itself creating an even more complex system to sell unpopular music that is already available elsewhere .
The same logic also applies to the small number of pop bands ready to sell their music without DRM : compared to the volume of music sold through the big labels , they simply do n’t matter .
What About Licensing FairPlay ?
The record labels do n't want to give up DRM .
They also do n't share Apple 's problems with FairPlay -- that it ’s a big job to maintain and constantly under siege -- because they are protected by their licensing contracts with Apple , which demand damages if FairPlay is ever cracked and not immediately repaired .
The labels ’ only problem with DRM is that Apple 's FairPlay is the only commercially successful version for downloads .
For the labels , that 's a liability , because it gives Apple a huge amount of leverage in its negotiations .
What ’s involved in Apple licensing FairPlay ?

From a Washington friend of IfP
HI .
Thanks to all of you who attended the town meeting on Tuesday .
We had a huge turnout–over 800 people came .
The speakers were fabulous !
For those of you who were not able to make it , access to the videos are listed at the end of this email .
That event was the beginning of our work .
There is a lot of work to do in a short time to gear up for and organize support for the impeachment bill : SJM 8016 and the hearing on March 1 .
It is clear that the March 1st hearing will take on larger than life proportions –opposition forces want to crush it before it gains any more momentum .
Rumors are floating about some heavy hitters showing up at the little committee hearing on March 1st .
We do n’t want to get knocked out in this round .
Our strategy is to make it clear that we expect our elected officials –and especially Democrats–to take their oath of office seriously and protect and defend the Constitution .
This means calling for immediate impeachment investigations into the many serious violations of law and the abuse of power of Bush and Cheney .
We need a massive letter / emailing / faxing / phone calling effort to all our elected officials –in the state legislature as well as to our U.S. Congressional delegation .
Attached is contact information for our U.S. Senators and Representatives , who must be contacted so they are clear that we expect them to lead this effort or follow our lead : opposition is not an option .
You can also locate here :

“ > http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/cgi-bin/newseek.cgi?site=ctc&state=wa
I have also included information in the attached Gearing Up document about the Govt .
Ops committee and contact information for the state legislatures .
Please remember to keep the pressure on members of the Washington State Senate .
The only issue for them is this : are these allegations of abuses of power serious enough to warrant an impeachment investigation bu Congress ?
Here is the contact info :

“ > http://apps.leg.wa.gov/memberemail/Default.aspx?Chamber’S
Lastly , the Gearing up document has information about the serious allegations that we have focused on , the laws that have been broken and responses to some of the excuses given by various elected officials about why impeachment should be off the table .
Action on March 1st :
Rally : on the Capitol steps @ 1 pm .
Senate Committee hearing : March 1 , 2007 @ 3:30 p.m. in the Cherberg Bldg , Room # 2 .
We need people !
Lots of people !
Bring your friends .
Bring signs .
This is a peaceful demonstration of support for the Constitution .
“ We miss it and want it back ! ” Impeachment is the only remedy for presidential abuses of power .
Spread the Word :
Forward this email to everyone you know .

Artist 's drawing of Esa 's lunar lander spacecraft
Enlarge Image
Planting flowers , however , was not on the Apollo agenda .
Could Europe beat the mighty US to that particular goal ?
One small seed for man , one giant branching - out for mankind ?
In fact , according to the European Space Agency 's Bernard Foing , it is more likely to be a bulb than a seed - perhaps even that most European of plants , a Dutch tulip .
" They bring their own nutrients with them , you do n't need any resources from the soil , " he told me on the fringes of the European Geosciences Union ( EGU ) conference last week .
" Also , we have looked at other types of plant like the mustard plant Arabidopsis ; it 's a very resistant plant , its genome has been fully sequenced .
" So you could do experiments where you see what does it take to adapt it to another planet , where are those characteristics encoded in the genome , and so make hard science but also make technical applications of what types of plant could be engineered to better survive in these conditions , and what type of plants could be engineered to adapt to very extreme conditions , even having the possibility later to find applications on Earth as well . "
It is , at least , an intriguing vision .
' Eternal light '
Dr Foing 's formal job title within Esa is " chief scientist " , and he comes with formidable pedigree , not least being the leader of Esa 's pioneering Smart - 1 mission .
But he could equally well have inscribed on his business card " Chief Space Visionary , Europe " .
Say it with flowers : could tulips from Amsterdam grow on the Moon ?
The Moon tulip is just one example of the futuristic , fun and possibly even feasible ideas dreamt up in his think - tanks headquartered at Esa 's European Space Research and Technology Centre ( Estec ) in the Netherlands .
Also on the drawing board is a robotic lander .
" Ten years ago , we had a lunar studies group making a feasibility study and design for a lunar lander at the equator or the pole , " Dr Foing recalls .
" But at that time it was very difficult to design a mission at low cost , because a lot of technologies needed to be developed , and also we did n't know what the polar region of the Moon looked like .
" With current missions we have much better knowledge of the polar regions as a site where we could search for ice ; and also with Smart - 1 we have identified some ' peaks of eternal light ' where we would like to land - these are areas near the poles of the Moon which have sunlight all the time , even in winter . "
Landing at one of these sites would guarantee solar power all day and all year round .
Various working groups are now discussing what should be done to take best advantage of these sites ; what equipment should be carried on a robotic lander , how far rovers should rove , how to plan missions so they go from the safest operations to progressively more risky ventures carrying potentially greater rewards ?
Currently on the drawing board is a lander weighing about 180kg which could be launched at relatively low cost .
Out of this lander would emerge a rover designed to stray no more than 10 or 20 km from the landing site .
Between them , the lander and rover would perform a range of experiments - analysis of rocks and soil , measuring radiation to see if humans could survive it , examining the Moon 's inner structure .
The solar - powered rover would explore areas of 'eternal light '
This is also the phase when lunar soil would receive its first gift from the Amsterdam tulip trade , perhaps planted inside a plastic biosphere with carbon dioxide on tap .
Having finished its domestic duties , the vehicle would then rove off to the edge of a polar crater , which are shadowlands replete with temptation .
" There are ideas that in the permanently shaded reservoirs at the poles you could have ice reservoirs which have been delivered by comets , " said Pascale Ehrenfreund , professor of astrobiology at Leiden University in the Netherlands .
" Cometary ice is dominated by water ice , but always contains other molecules such as carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide , traces of methanol , traces of HCN [ hydrogen cyanide ] ; and then in those areas you certainly have quite a bit of radiation which is probably partly destroying that kind of material if it is present , but it is also creating more complex structures . "
Would the rover descend into the crater or just peer over the edge ?
Would it launch a much smaller tethered rover - a " nanorover " in the current Esa phraseology - or fire harpoons down into the dark ice ?
All these possibilities are floating in the intellectual ether , and Bernard Foing 's various working groups are in discussion with scientists in European research institutions over what instruments should be priorities for the payload and what delivery systems are needed to get them there .
But he wants a decision soon , ideally during Esa 's ministerial conference in 2008 ; that could lead , he says , to a launch between 2012 and 2014 .
Soft landings
But what is it all for - is the Moon really that exciting any more ?
Have n't we been there , planted the flags , bought the Apollo t- shirts and brought back the Moon rock ?
So far in Europe we have demonstrated landing on a body with an atmosphere successfully
Peter Falkner , Estec
" Certainly we have 365 kg of Moon material on the Earth , but I think there are many scientific aspects still to be achieved there , " said Peter Falkner , head of Estec 's planetary exploration studies section .
And there are technological objectives which go beyond a Moon visit .
Just as Smart - 1 has tested an ion drive for long - distance propulsion , a lunar lander could also pilot equipment and procedures which could later find a use on more far - flung missions .
" Certainly there are several technological issues to be solved , " observed Dr Faulkner , recalling the successful landing of the Huygens probe on Titan and the less successful end of the Beagle 2 Mars mission .
" So far in Europe we have demonstrated landing on a body with an atmosphere successfully , on Titan , and there are several reasons for the failure we had on Mars .
" On the Moon there is no atmosphere ; you need a fully controlled landing , so your orbital velocity has to be reduced with a chemical engine .
At the moment we do not have all this technology completely available in Europe , so this is what has to be developed . "
At this point the cynic says " Well OK , but Nasa did it in the 1960s , and with people on board .
What is the rationale for getting where the Americans were half a century earlier ? "
One reason is that Europe , being a late starter in space , is determined to catch up on some core technologies .
Another is that it sees a diversification in space priorities ; Esa will not be the next agency to put humans on the Moon ( currently that appears to be a race between the US and China ) ; but with some innovative rovers , landers , harpoons and other gadgets , it may be able to do things which Nasa and the Chinese space agency will not .
And the tulips ?
Bernard Foing sees them as a part of a sequence of research projects which will take ever more complex organisms to the Moon ; bacteria first , perhaps , then plants , then animals , though probably not four - legged followers of Laika the pioneering Soviet space dog .
" We have to look at all the different social and ethical aspects of that .
But I think there are a number of small animals like insects where you could learn things - spiders on the moon ? "
It is perhaps interesting in an era when there is so much debate about the ethics and value of using animals prior to humans in medical research to see the different approaches agencies are taking to something involving greater risks - Moon travel .
While the US is apparently content to send humans first and perhaps exclusively , Europe seems set on a different track , using other organisms , both for the general and specific information they can yield .
" I would be interested to see how a spider would react in a different gravity world , " said Bernard Foing , " and also some of them are very resistant to radiation .
" So there are some insects which could be of use - or maybe , and this a bit more speculative - a mixture of insects and robotic insects . "
The tulips , however , will undoubtedly be natural - an symbolic flowering , perhaps , of a distinctly European approach to space science .

Grapher Server
Franz asked me to try my hand at tying together AllegroServe and GraphViz .
I decided , perhaps foolishly , that this would be a good time to figure out how to use javascript and step onto that AJAX bandwagon .
Thanks to Franz 's AllegroServe and Common Lisp , that turned out to be a very enjoyable ride .
The result is Grapher Server : an AJAX web application that uses CL - Graph to provide two interactive examples of graphing fun .
The first lets you experiment with several random graph generation algorithms and the second provides an interactive class browser .
The application is being served from an older G4 running on my home network and using the Dynamic DNS service to resolve the metabang.gotdns.com .
Sometimes , the update daemon running on my computer gets confused and hands DynDNS the wrong IP ; sometimes my kids shut the computer down < whoopts , sorry dad > .
All that is to say that this may not be the most reliable of servers but it will have to do until I switch to a hosting provider that can handle Lisp !
I 'm told that Franz hopes to get this up on their servers at some point < cool > and I 'll certainly let everyone know if that happens .
I also intend the release the code I used and do some more explaining but I 'm not sure when I 'll get to that .
In the meantime , enjoy .

More Haste , Less Speed
The Complexity of Lazy Evaluation Richard Bird , Geraint Jones and Oege de Moor
We have shown , we believe for the first time , that lazy evaluation of functional programming languages is strictly more powerful than eager evaluation , as measured by the asymptotic complexity of evaluating certain programs .
One of the attractions of functional programming languages - ones that do not use assignments - is that programs consist in essence of mathematical equations , and can be reasoned about by everyday mathematical techniques such as the substitution of an expression for any other which is equal to it .
However , the most straightforward way of implementing a set of equations as a program - eager evaluation as it is called - evaluates the arguments of functions first , and only then applies those functions .
It turns out to be relatively straightforward to estimate the execution time of functional programs under an eager evaluation strategy , but it is hard to reason about the value produced : applying a constant function to a non-terminating expression leads to a non-terminating program , rather than returning the constant .
This interferes with equational reasoning : you cannot always substitute for each other the value of the constant and an application of a constant function .
Soundness of equational reasoning comes from normal order evaluation , in which functions are applied to unevaluated arguments , although if many copies are made of an unevaluated argument it might have to be evaluated many times , at great cost in execution time .
Languages such as Haskell use lazy evaluation , which applies functions to arguments whose evaluation is postponed until the first ( but only the first ) time their values are needed .
This ensures that equational reasoning about the values of programs is sound , at the expense of making it extremely hard to reason about when expressions are evaluated , and to estimate how much work is involved in doing so .
We are interested in exploiting the elegance and power of lazy evaluation , but also in developing techniques to measure the cost of doing so .
Nicholas Pippenger showed that under certain simple restrictions , problems that can be solved in linear time in a language with assignments must take longer ( by a logarithmic factor ) in an eagerly evaluated purely functional language .
Our paper ( Journal of Functional Programming , 7(5) :541-547 , September 1997 ) shows that a lazy functional program solves Pippenger 's problem in linear time .
This demonstrates that lazy evaluation is strictly more efficient - in asymptotic terms - than eager evaluation , and that there is no general complexity - preserving translation of lazy programs into an eager functional language .

Websites like Pandora offer listeners a personalised service
The warning comes after a decision by a US copyright body to increase royalty payments for music via the net .
Commercial webcasters in the US now face the prospect of paying more than twice as much for every track they play .
Interactive services like Pandora and Last .fm say they could be badly hit .
These kinds of websites have attracted a growing audience by offering users their own personalised radio station .
Users enter their favourite artists or track , and the internet radio stations stream music to them to suit their tastes .
' Grassroots movement '
The founder of Pandora , which is based in Oakland California , has e-mailed all the station 's users warning them that the service may not survive .
Tim Westergren called the rise in royalties a " terribly ill - conceived attempt to crush a powerful and positive grassroots movement that is sweeping across the music world " .
It is a decision by the Copyright Royalty Board , a US body , which has caused the panic .
We are competing with unlicensed services and this makes it almost commercially unworkable
Martin Stiksel Last.fm
In a decision which the internet radio stations say was influenced by the record labels , it has ruled that royalties should rise from .08 cents per track to .19 cents by 2010 .
The figures are tiny but for small start - up businesses they could prove crippling .
" Left unchanged , " says Mr Westergren , " these rates will end internet radio , period . "
Pandora is not licensed outside the US , and warns on its site that it is only for US citizens .
But the site has plenty of users around the world who ignore that message .
UK concern
Last.fm , an interactive music service based in London that has 15 million users worldwide , is also worried by the American ruling .
The founders of the service say that internet radio is only one part of what it offers but they are concerned by what is happening in the US .
" The US is one of our strongest markets , " says Martin Stiksel of Last.fm .
" We are competing with unlicensed services and this makes it almost commercially unworkable .
Users are being driven away from licenced services that are trying to do the right thing . "
Anyone who streams music over the internet has to pay a licence fee , whether they are standard broadcast radio stations putting their content online , or new internet start - ups .
In the UK , the fees are administered by a music industry organisation called Phonographic Performance Ltd ( PPL ) .
A spokesman for PPL said the fees paid by internet radio stations in the UK were currently under negotiation but the likely result was that they would end up paying more .

This scoop from Cnet sure caught my eye :
Google is expanding its lucrative Internet advertising network into the print world in a bold attempt to capture traditional ad dollars .
The search king , which makes 99 percent of its revenue from Internet ads , is quietly testing the waters of print advertising sales , according to executives at several companies that have bought the ads .
Google recently began buying ad pages in technology magazines , including PC Magazine and Maximum PC , and reselling those pages–cut into quarters or fifths –to small advertisers that already belong to its online ad network , dubbed AdWords .
This certainly has nothing to do with search .
An image of the ads is here .
This feels like a revenue diversification play , to be sure – selling directories and marketplace ads is always the next step once a publisher exhausts the low hanging fruit of its core offerings – but I wonder what the real agenda is here .
Does
Google see an opportunity to , in essence , become the middleman for anywhere from one to ten pages of directory / marketplace ads in nearly every B2B and niche magazine in the world ?
Of course it does .
And why not ?
It has the infrastructure in place ( as I said in my previous excerpt , the most valuable asset it has after their tech is its network of advertisers ) .
Let ’s see .
The Cnet piece said that the advertisers paid Google $ 1000 for their ads in PCMagazine .
There were five of these advertisers – so $ 5 K .
The manufacturing / distribution cost of that page is probably no more than a grand , so that ’s $ 4 K in profit to split between Google and the publishers of PC Magazine .
Let ’s say the split is 70/30 .
That ’s $ 1200 to Google , and $ 2800 to the publisher .
As with the online world , this is free money for the publisher , and they probably love it .
Now , $ 1200 a page , say an average of five pages per B2B magazine , at least 1500 viable B2B mags in the country ( probably more , but …. ) , so do the math , that ’s $ 1200 times 5 times 1500 , that ’s , er , $ 9 million , and that ’s one issue .
Say the average B2B magazine comes out 18 times a year ( some are monthly , some weekly , some biweekly etc. ) , that ’s $ 162 million in revenue a year , the vast majority of that pure profit .
And that ’s just to start .
Yeah , I see how that might be interesting to Google .
And to publishers who , in the end , are never very good at monetizing the back of their book .
For now , this feels like a test .
But this sure as heck does n’t feel like a groovy , engineering - driven , throw - it - against - the - wall kind of test .
This is a test of a very real opportunity .
Update : Google sent me a statement , thin soup , but here you go :
Google is testing a program to place ads from our advertising network
into U.S. print publications .
This limited test is part of Google’s
continuing effort to develop new ways to provide effective and useful
advertising to advertisers , publishers and users .

Introduction
Software Transactional Memory , or STM , is an abstraction for concurrent communication .
The main benefits of STM are composability and modularity .
That is , using STM you can write concurrent abstractions that can be easily composed with any other abstraction built using STM , without exposing the details of how your abstraction ensures safety .
This is typically not the case with other forms of concurrent communication , such as locks or MVars .
STM for Haskell was first implemented in GHC 6.4 .
There exist STM implementations for other compilers .

Projects using STM
As of April 2011 , there were more than 200 projects on Hackage with dependencies on GHC's STM implementation , including :
Conjure ( a bittorrent client ) is using STM quite heavily .
Shellac is a framework for building read - eval - print style shells .
It uses STM , but in a pretty limited way .
Pugs ( an implementation of Perl 6 in Haskell ) uses STM , and also exposes STM to the Perl 6 programmer via a similar interface to STM Haskell .
Happstack , a web framework
TCache , a transactional cache with configurable persitence .
Barracuda ,
An ad - hoc chat program
Combinatorrent , a BitTorrent client , based on STM for concurrency
Scurry , P2P VPN implementation .
Examples
Trans - fats are in many fried and baked foods
The city 's health officials have for years warned that the fats can cause obesity and lead to heart disease .
Trans - fats go into partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , which is commonly used for frying and baking .
The unanimous vote makes the city the first in the US to ban the fats , although the original strict deadline to comply has been lengthened .
Restaurants will be banned from using most frying oils containing trans - fats from 1 July , and will have to eliminate the fats from all foods by 1 July 2008 .
' Unrealistic deadline '
Trans - fats are made when food processors harden fat to make it more like butter .
It can then be used for frying or baking , or put into processed foods and ready - made mixes for cakes and drinks like hot chocolate .
The Food and Drug Administration estimates that on average , Americans eat 4.7lb ( 2.14kg ) of trans - fats each year .
The move has met with opposition from 24,000 restaurant owners in the city , who said the original six - month deadline to replace cooking oils and fats was unrealistic .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has defended the move .
TRANS -FATS
They are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils , turning oily foods into semi- solid foods

Turkmenistan 's President Saparmurat Niyazov established a cult of personality , building many statues of himself across the country .
President Niyazov ruled the energy - rich country for 20 years , styling himself as Turkmenbashi , or Leader of all Turkmens .
Much of the income from energy deals was poured into the capital Ashgabat 's showcase projects , such as the presidential palace .
The authoritarian leader tightly censored media , despite inaugurating the book - shaped House of Free Creativity dedicated to the free media in Ashgabat in October .
Mr Niyazov formally opened an amusement park named after him less than two weeks ago .
The park features an exhibit of characters from Turkmen folklore .
The park , a national version of Disneyland , is spread over 33 hectares ( 88 acres ) .
There are very few textbooks in Turkmenistan 's schools apart from works by Mr Niyazov such as his Ruhnama - a mix of history and spiritual guidance .
Known as the Book of the Soul , the Ruhnama was required reading and was treated with the reverence normally reserved for religious works .

Deadliest Bomb in Iraq is Made by Iran , U.S. Says
The most lethal weapon directed against American troops in Iraq is an explosive - packed cylinder that United States intelligence asserts is being supplied by Iran .
The assertion of an Iranian role in supplying the device to Shiite militias reflects broad agreement among American intelligence agencies , although officials acknowledge that the picture is not entirely complete .
In interviews , civilian and military officials from a broad range of government agencies provided specific details to support what until now has been a more generally worded claim , in a new National Intelligence Estimate , that Iran is providing “ lethal support ” to Shiite militants in Iraq .
Any assertion of an Iranian contribution to attacks on Americans in Iraq is both politically and diplomatically volatile .
The officials said they were willing to discuss the issue to respond to what they described as an increasingly worrisome threat to American forces in Iraq , and were not trying to lay the basis for an American attack on Iran .

The link that American intelligence has drawn to Iran is based on a number of factors , including an analysis of captured devices , examination of debris after attacks , and intelligence on training of Shiite militants in Iran and in Iraq by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and by Hezbollah militants believed to be working at the behest of Tehran .
. . .
The information includes interrogation reports from the raids indicating that money and weapons components are being brought into Iraq from across the Iranian border in vehicles that travel at night .
One of the detainees has identified an Iranian operative as having supplied two of the bombs .
The border crossing at Mehran is identified as a major crossing point for the smuggling of money and weapons for Shiite militants , according to the intelligence .

You Ca n’t Be Too Skeptical of Authority
Do n’t assume anything administration officials tell you is true .
In fact , you are probably better off assuming anything they tell you is a lie .
Demand proof for their every assertion .
Assume the proof is a lie .
Demand that they prove that their proof is accurate .
Just because they say it , does n’t mean it should be make the headlines .
The absence of supporting evidence for their assertion -- or a preponderance of evidence that contradicts the assertion -- may be more newsworthy than the assertion itself .
Do n’t print anonymous assertions .
Demand that sources make themselves accountable for what they insist is true .
Provocation Alone Does Not Justify War
War is so serious that even proving the existence of a casus belli is n’t enough .
Make officials prove to the public that going to war will make things better .
Be Particularly Skeptical of Secrecy
Do n’t assume that these officials , with their access to secret intelligence , know more than you do .
Alternately , assume that they do indeed know more than you do – and are trying to keep intelligence that would undermine their arguments secret .
Do n’t Just Give Voice to the Administration Officials
Give voice to the skeptics ; do n’t marginalize and mock them .
Listen to and quote the people who got it right last time :
The intelligence officials , state department officials , war - college instructors and many others who predicted the problem we are now facing , but who were largely ignored .

Editor & Publisher
" who , on his own , or with Judith Miller , wrote some of the key , and badly misleading or downright inaccurate , articles about Iraqi WMDs in the run-up to the 2003 invasion , " and
The fundamental flaws in this article are as glaring as they are grotesque .
Given the very ignominious history of Gordon and the NYT concerning the administration 's war - seeking claims , how can this article possibly have been published ?
Gordon himself " wrote with Miller the paper 's most widely criticized -- even by the Times itself -- WMD story of all , the Sept. 8 , 2002 , ' aluminum tubes ' story that proved so influential , especially since the administration trumpeted it on TV talk shows " ( h/t Zack ) .
The fundamental flaws in this article are as glaring as they are grotesque .
Given the very ignominious history of Gordon and the NYT concerning the administration 's war - seeking claims , how can this article possibly have been published ?
Over the past few weeks , has published several detailed and well - documented articles casting serious doubt on the administration 's claims that Iran is fueling the Iraqi insurgency with weapons .
A couple of months ago , published a very well - researched article reporting that extensive searches by British military brigades in Southern Iraq -- specifically in the areas where such weapons would almost certainly be transported and maintained -- have turned up nothing .
It seemed as though the media was treating the war - inflaming claims of Bush officials against Iran much more skeptically , refusing to simply pass along accusations without first conducting an investigation to determine if those claims were true .
But today , does precisely the opposite -- it has published a lengthy , prominent front - page article by Michael Gordon that does nothing , literally , but mindlessly recite administration claims about Iran 's weapons - supplying activities without the slightest questioning , investigation , or presentation of ample counter - evidence .
The entire article is nothing more than one accusatory claim about Iran after the next , all emanating from the mouths of anonymous military and " intelligence officials " without the slightest verified evidence , and Gordon just mindlessly repeats what he has been told in one provocative paragraph after the next .
Start with the headline : .
That is a proposition that is extremely inflammatory -- it suggests that Iranians bear responsibility for attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq , even though that is a claim for which almost no evidence has been presented and which is very much in dispute .
Why should that be the basis for a prominent headline when Gordon 's sole basis for it are the uncorroborated assertions of the Bush administration ?
The very first paragraph following that headline is the most inflammatory :
Is that extremely provocative claim even true ?
Gordon never says , and he does not really appear to care .
He is in Pravda Spokesman mode throughout the entire article -- offering himself up as a megaphone for administration assertions without the slightest amount of scrutiny , investigation or opposing views .
What is the basis for the entire article ?
Gordon summarizes it this way :
Every one of Gordon 's sources are officials in the Bush administration , and all of them are completely anonymous , so one has no way to assess their interest , perspective , bias , or independence .
And Gordon himself does not offer the slightest information to enable the reader to make such determinations , and he himself appears blissfully uninterested in any of that .
This is completely irresponsible journalism .
The latest indications , including new revelations over the last few days , lend strong support to the suspicion that the Bush administration is intensifying its preparations for a military confrontation with Iran .
The emotional and psychological impact of Gordon 's story is glaringly obvious -- if Iranians are purposely supplying Shiite militias with the " most lethal weapon directed against American troops , " that obviously will have the effect of heightening anger towards Iranians among Americans and leading them to believe that war against Iran is necessary because they are killing our troops .
Gordon recognizes the high stakes of his story , but naively passes this along :
No , perish the thought .
But why are these sources granted anonymity ?
All they are doing is passing along the standard , official line of the Bush administration , supposedly revealing the most inflammatory conclusions that the administration will " unveil " in just a few days .
What possible purpose is served by shrouding these sources in anonymity in order to enable them to pass along these controversial claims with the appearance that Gordon has scored some sort of " scoop " by provoking candid " officials " to speak off the record ?
This is just Bush administration propaganda dressed up as a " leak " to induce Gordon and theto excitedly publish this on their front page .
Judy Miller anyone ?
Speaking of Judy Miller , thetoday gives us one paragraph after the next like this one : Has Gordon reviewed any of those devices , seen any of the debris or the reports describing them , spoken to independent experts about the accuracy of the administration 's claims , or evaluated the credibility of the original sources for all of this alleged " intelligence " ?
If he has done any of that , he does not share any of those assessments in his article .
He is simply echoing what he has been told , without regard to its persuasive qualities .
In fact , with the exception of one cursory note buried in the middle that the Iranian Government denies supplying Shiite militias with weapons , every paragraph in the article -- every one -- simply echoes accusations by military and other Bush officials that Iran is behind the attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq .
If the White House were to prepare one of its famous Position Papers setting forth its case against Iran , it would look exactly like the article Gordon and thejust published on behalf of the administration .
What is the point of this sort of article ?
Why would thejust offer itself up again as a mindless vessel for what are clearly war - seeking accusations by the administration ?
Have they learned nothing ?
And all of this is particularly inexcusable in light of the ample analysis and -- already published by theand , among others -- which raise serious questions about the reliability of the administration 's accusations against Iran .
There is no excuse whatsoever for writing a long , prominent article summarizing the administration 's claims without even alluding to that evidence , let alone failing to conduct any investigation to determine theof the government 's statements . :
As I noted the other day , 's Dan Froomkin published a list of basic journalistic rules for avoiding the media 's government - enabling mistakes in Vietnam and Iraq .
If theset out to create a textbook article which violates as many of these principles as possible , it would not have been able to surpass the article published today by Gordon .
Here are just a few of Froomkin 's rules :
Is there a single journalistic principle which this article did not violate ?
As Greg Mitchell recalls in an article in , it was Michael Gordon
There are those who say that in the Internet age the rules of grammar and style are dead .
But the people at the University of Chicago Press , publisher of the Chicago Manual of Style , are not among them .
And so starting tomorrow the manual — sometimes known as publishing ’s Miss Manners — will be available online by subscription , meaning that those who need to know , pronto , whether it is ever all right to capitalize the first letters of e. e. cummings ’s name will no longer have to search through the more than 956 - page volume to find the answer .
The price for the online manual will be $ 25 for individuals for the first year , $ 30 thereafter , and more for institutions , depending on their size .
The list price of the hardcover print version is $ 55 .
And if you listen to Anita Samen , managing editor of the press ’s books division , having the manual online is going to revolutionize the way its users , who include writers , editors and publishers , work .
“ You can consult it on the fly , ” she said , “ so you are free to do your writing and editing without having to retain huge numbers of rules in your head . ”

Allegations of severe torture have regularly emerged from Iraq
Manfred Nowak said the situation in Iraq was " out of control " , with abuses being committed by security forces , militia groups and anti-US insurgents .
Bodies found in the Baghdad morgue " often bear signs of severe torture " , said the human rights office of the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq in a report .
The wounds confirmed reports given by refugees from Iraq , Mr Nowak said .
He told journalists at a briefing in Geneva that he had yet to visit Iraq , but he was able to base his information on autopsies and interviews with Iraqis in neighbouring Jordan .
" What most people tell you is that the situation as far as torture is concerned now in Iraq is totally out of hand , " the Austrian law professor said .
" The situation is so bad many people say it is worse than it has been in the times of Saddam Hussein , " he added .
Brutal methods
The UN report says detainees ' bodies often show signs of beating using electrical cables , wounds in heads and genitals , broken legs and hands , electric and cigarette burns .
Bodies found at the Baghdad mortuary " often bear signs of severe torture including acid- induced injuries and burns caused by chemical substances " .
Many bodies have missing skin , broken bones , back , hands and legs , missing eyes , missing teeth and wounds caused by power drills or nails , the UN report says .
Victims come from prisons run by US - led multinational forces as well as by the ministries of interior and defence and private militias , the report said .
The most brutal torture methods were employed by private militias , Mr Nowak told journalists .
The report also says the frequency of sectarian bloodletting means bodies are often found which " bear signs indicating that the victims have been brutally tortured before their extra-judicial execution " .
It concludes that torture threatens " the very fabric of the country " as victims exact their own revenge and fuel further violence .
Mr Nowak said he would like to visit Iraq in person , but the current situation would not allow him to prepare an accurate report , because it would not be safe to leave Baghdad 's heavily guarded Green Zone where the Iraqi government and US leadership are situated .
But several organizations have made it clear that cheerleading accounts for a disproportionate number of major injuries in youth or college athletics .
In 2005 , the National Collegiate Athletic Association ’s Catastrophic Injury Insurance Program found that 25 percent of the money spent on claims for student - athletes since 1998 resulted from cheerleading .
That made it second only to football .
The ratio of cheerleaders to football players is about 12 to 100 .
After a high - profile injury a year ago to a Southern Illinois cheerleader — her fall from a pyramid was caught on video and broadcast widely — the N.C.A.A. cracked down with new restrictions .
The guidelines mandated the use of mats when cheerleaders perform more challenging stunts , and most significantly , college coaches now must take a safety certification course if they want catastrophic insurance coverage .
Inadequate training of coaches is the most frequently cited cause of injuries .
Inexperienced coaches will have squads try complex stunts without following accepted step - by - step progressions to acquire the skills required to safely attempt the trick .
The coaches association certification , which costs $ 75 and is available to coaches of all levels , details proper techniques and procedures .
While the association has vigorously pushed numerous safety initiatives , it has only so much influence over the unconfined cheerleading community .
There are more than 75 cheerleading organizations , varying from state to state and region to region , all with their own regulations and competitions .
Even in high school cheerleading , there is no uniformity of regulations nationwide and little statewide control .
Many teams routinely do stunts that would be banned in the N.C.A.A .
This is largely because most states do not consider cheerleading a sport , so it is not under the aegis of a powerful state athletic association .
Instead , cheerleading is labeled an activity , which often means it is regulated by the same state education groups that govern the chess , debate and French clubs .
“ Some states do n’t want to touch cheerleading with a 10 - foot pole , ” said Susan Loomis , the spirit coordinator of the National Federation of State High School Associations who also oversees a coaches education program .
“ Fifteen to 18 states actually regulate cheerleading .
But many , many schools do not follow our rulebook and their coaches are not skilled — sometimes with disastrous results . ”
The reason they teach biology before they teach chemistry in high school is that biology was invented first .
Even though you need chemistry to do biology , but not vice versa .
The reason that you have a water bubbler in your office is that it used to be difficult to filter water effectively .
The reason that Blockbuster exists is that VCR tapes used to cost more than $ 100 .
The reason that SUVs have a truck chassis is that the government regulates vehicles with a truck chassis differently .
The reason you have a front lawn is to demonstrate to your friends and neighbors how much time and energy you ’re prepared to waste .
The reason the typewriter keyboard is in a weird order is that original typewriters jammed , and they needed to rearrange the letters to keep common letters far apart .
The reason we do n’t have school in the summer is so our kids can help with farmwork .
Or because it ’s too hot and there ’s no air conditioning …
The reason there ’s a toll on that bridge but not on that road is that there used to be a ferry on that river , and the ferryman needed to make a living .
The reason you go to a building to go to work every day is that steam or water power used to turn a giant winch - like structure that went right through the factory building .
Every workman used that power to do his work .
As factories got more sophisticated , it remained efficient to move the workers , not the stuff .
What ’s your reason ?
When it comes to cosmology , the macro scale is important .
As scientists search for the reasons behind the increasing rate at which the universe is expanding , they modify Einstein ’s theory of gravity and delve into dark energy theories to explain this counter - intuitive phenomenon .
These simple modifications are represented as f ( R ) theories , and they are used to explain what is seen on a cosmic scale .
But there ’s a problem .
“ Some modified theories of gravity have nice features for cosmology , on the big scale , but they do n’t work so well on the small scale , ” Gonzalo Olmo explains to PhysOrg.com .
“ I managed to solve these equations on the micro level , and I found that they are inconsistent . ”
Olmo , 28 , is a post- doc at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee .
He says he solved these equations two years ago , but waited until interpreting them to have them published .
His recent letter in Physical Review Letters , which puts forth the equations and their interpretations , is titled “ Violation of the Equivalence Principle in Modified Theories of Gravity . ”
In the Letter , Olmo presents equations that suggest that when some modified theories of gravity are applied to the micro scale , new properties emerge that can effectively rule out some theories that explain accelerating universe expansion .
“ If we manage to show these theories are not consistent , which it looks like , then this approach in cosmology would be useless , ” Olmo points out .
He says that there are two main ways modified theories are studied : in the metric formalism or in the Palatini formalism .
Olmo explains that his paper focuses on theories of gravity in the Palatini formalism .
“ [ T ] he connection is regarded as independent of the metric and , therefore , must be determined by solving its corresponding field equations , ” the paper says .
Olmo says that when he solved the equations on the micro scale , he noticed the emergence of new properties :
“ These new properties have never been seen in other modified theories of gravity , and these new properties are what make these theories so weird on the micro scale . ”
Even though Olmo says that these theories would not do to explain the expansion of the universe , since they are inconsistent on the micro scale , there are some uses for modified theories of gravity .
He explains that the differences between how these modified theories work on the macro scale and on the micro scale could offer insight into the interaction between gravitation and quantum physics .
“ According to Einstein , ” Olmo explains , “ spacetime should be nearly flat in , for instance , your dining room or the interior of an atom . ”
He pauses before continuing : “ However , in Palatini theories we find that it is curved even on a micro level , which has a strong effect on the properties of the quantum world .
This can lead to better understanding by seeing how these modified theories of gravity interact with quantum theory . ”
“ There are different possibilities to the reasons behind the acceleration of the universe , ” continues Olmo .
“ Some theorists use dark energy to explain the expansion , and others modify the equations of gravity to say it is not dark energy .
However , there could be a mix . ”
He says that it is very difficult to distinguish the effects of dark energy from those of modified equations , and the difference could hold the key to discovering what ’s behind the increasing rate of expansion of our universe .
And he thinks applying modified theories of gravity to the micro scale as well as to the macro scale could help determine the different effects .
“ If this idea can get going , ” he enthuses , “ there could be a very interesting future . ”

North Korea 's apparent test of a nuclear device could have a devastating effect on the world 's long struggle to contain the spread of the most powerful military weapon known to man .
Experts have long worried that if the Pyongyang regime flaunted its atomic hardware , Asia might be drawn into an arms race reminiscent of the early days of the cold war .
The spiral could develop like this : Threatened , Japan and South Korea start their own weapons programs .
China piles up bombs to protect its regional superpower status .
India strives to catch China , and then Paki-stan tries to counter India , and then ....
But this nightmare scenario is far from inevitable , point out experts .
Everything depends on what the US and other interested governments do to try to repair a nonproliferation system that , despite its faults , has served the globe well for decades .
" Now is the time for farsighted , collaborative , and smart policies to prevent the further spread and use of nuclear weapons , " concludes George Perkovich , a nuclear strategy and nonproliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington .
Tuesday North Korea took its nuclear bluster to a new level , saying it could fire a nuclear - tipped missile unless the US agreed to bilateral negotiations .
Monday 's nuclear test was " an expression of our intention to face the United States across the negotiating table , " an unnamed North Korea official told South Korea 's Yonhap news agency .
Most experts in and outside the US government doubt that Pyongyang has the expertise to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on an intercontinental ballistic missile .
North Korea was simply trying to negotiate with threats and intimidation , said John Bolton , US ambassador to the UN .
" It 's worked for them before .
It 's not going to work this time , " Mr. Bolton said .
At the United Nations Security Council , discussions resumed concerning sanctions proposed by the US .
The sanctions package could include everything from international inspection of all cargo leaving or entering North Korea to a prohibition on any military trade with the reclusive Pyongyang regime .
As US officials noted , even North Korea 's claim that it had exploded a nuclear device represented the crossing of a fateful threshold .
If nothing else , Pyongyang had called Washington 's bluff , some experts pointed out .
President Bush , among others , has said in the past that the US would not " tolerate " an overtly nuclear North Korea .
Given the military difficulties of attacking a nuclear - weapon state , and of destroying stockpiles of fissile material , " tolerate " may no longer be the operative word .
" Any US statements that North Korea cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons are meaningless bluster , " writes Anthony Cordesman , a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , in an analysis of the meaning of the North Korean test .
At the same time , the test shows that current US policies aimed at curbing North Korea 's nuclear ambitions have n't worked , says Daryl Kimball , executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington .
A new , more energetic diplomatic approach is needed – and fast , he says .
North Korea 's actions could " have devastating effects on the struggle against proliferation , " says Mr. Kimball .
Even before the test , current six - party talks on North Korea were stalled due to inflexibility on the part of both Washington and Pyongyang .
The US has indicated that a face - to - face meeting with North Korea might be possible in the context of these six - party negotiations .
That offer should remain on the table , say some experts , despite North Korea 's provocative actions .
However , in the short term , the US probably faces a period of tension and harsh words in its dealings with the unpredictable North Korean regime , says Jim Walsh , a proliferation expert at the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
Mr. Walsh , who visited North Korea last year , says that officials there continually told him that their ultimate goal is a denuclearized Korean peninsula – but that they would get nuclear weapons first , on the path toward that goal .
Thus a quick reversal of course on the part of the North Koreans may be unlikely .
" In the near term , this is not going to be undone , " says Walsh .
But there are nuclear programs that have been rolled back , he notes .
South Africa , among others , decided that atomic weapons were not in its national security interest .
North Korea – or , more specifically , the small cadre that runs the nation – does not so much want to be a nuclear power as to survive , says Walsh .
Right now , it sees an atomic arsenal as a means to that end .
" What they really want is normalized relations , " says Walsh .
Meanwhile , US policy has been inconsistent , veering back and forth between officials who want to negotiate with North Korea and those who want to squeeze it .
For now , the nuclear test is likely to strengthen the hand of US hard - liners .
" This will clarify US policy , but in a direction unlikely to yield results , " says Walsh .
Tony Blair recently announced plans to increase efficiency
The pilot exercise at National Insurance offices in Longbenton , North Tyneside , is part of a UK - drive to encourage staff to tidy their desks .
The Public and Commercial Services ( PCS ) union claimed the scheme was costing £ 7.4 m nationally and branded it " demeaning " and " demoralising " .
HM Revenue and Customs said it was in line with workstation training .
The exercise is part of the Lean programme , brought in by consultants Unipart , which has already seen public sector workers told to clear their desks of personal items .
The scheme is demoralising and demeaning .
Staff know how to order their desks themselves .
Public and Commercial Services Unio
The customs spokesman said : " Part of the Lean processing is to clear the workplace and only keep essential items to hand .
" This is in line with the workstation ergonomics training that all our staff receive and complies with the display screen equipment regulations ( 2002 ) .
" The markers on desks are used to demonstrate that it is much better to work in a tidy work environment where everything has its place .
" Staff involved have confirmed they prefer the tidier workspace . "
Red tape
But a PCS spokesman said : " The tape idea illustrates the madness of the Lean project .
" The scheme is demoralising and demeaning .
Staff know how to order their desks themselves .
" We had a situation in some offices in Scotland where staff were asked ' Is that banana on your desk active or inactive ? ' , meaning were they going to eat it ?
" If not , it had to be cleared away . "
The scheme is being implemented a month after Tony Blair outlined measures to save £ 2bn by cutting red tape .
The mayor said the attack had given Naples a bad name
The tourist , Matthew Godfrey , 25 , from Utah , was attacked , after trying to pursue two men who stole his camera and fled on a scooter .
Instead of helping him , a group of bystanders punched and kicked him , allowing the muggers to escape .
The mayor , Rosa Russo Jervolino , said the action of the locals in protecting the muggers tarnished the city 's name .
The police took Mr Godfrey to hospital where he was treated and released and subsequently left Naples .
I have officially invited Matthew ... to return to Naples soon to eat a pizza together
Leonardo Impegno ,
Local council
The police have arrested the two suspected thieves , acting on Mr Godfrey 's description of them , and are trying to identify the people who took part in the assault .
In her apology , the mayor said the attack was " inexcusable " and had given Naples an " uncivilised image " .
The head of the local council also condemned the behaviour of the local residents and offered Mr Godfrey a personal tour of the southern Italian city .

Thisstory was updated at 6:25 p.m. EDT .
WASHINGTON ?-NASA has selected Lockheed Martin as the prime contractor to design , developand build the OrionCrew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) , the planned replacementfor the space shuttle thatwill become the backbone of the agency 's human spaceflight program .
Lockheed Martin beat out a rival bid from Northrop Grumman and Boeing to win a contractNASA said would be potentially worth $ 8.15 billion .
NASA madethe long - awaited announcement Aug. 31 , ending an intensecompetition whose roots go back to 2004 , when U.S. PresidentGeorge W. Bush called for the development of a CEV to replace thespace shuttle and eventually carry astronauts to the Moon .
" The competitionwas fierce and the proposals were strong , " Doug Cooke , NASA deputy associateadministrator for exploration systems , said during an Aug. 31 press conferenceannouncing the selection .
NASA Administrator Mike Griffin briefed industry CEOson the decision at approximately 2:30 p.m. that day .

JoanneMaguire , executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. inDenver , said company employees were " humbled and excited " by the award .
" Workalready is under way and we are fully focused on the vital tasks that lie aheadto meet NASA 's requirements for the program , " she said in an Aug. 31 newsrelease .
LockheedMartin's stock , which opened the day at $ 81.85 a share and spent the morningtrending downward , abruptly began rising just after 1:30 p.m .
The stock closedat $ 82.60 a share , then rose in after - hours trading to $ 84.10 .
NorthropGrumman's stock , meanwhile , had been climbing throughout the morning until justafter 12:00 p.m. , when the advance turned into a mild retreat .
North Grummanopened at $ 66.84 and closed at $ 66.81 , then dropped to $ 65.40 in after - hourstrading .
" Clearly , Northrop Grumman is disappointed by today 's announcement , " Northrop Grummanspokesman Randy Belote said in an Aug. 31 telephone interview .
" Orion is , however , merely the first of many significant space systems required to enableroutine human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit .
Northrop Grumman andits teammates are already helping NASA define the requirements for futureelements and Northrop Grumman fully expects to play a significant role in thedevelopment and production of those systems . "
NASA saidin an Aug. 31 press release -- that went out even before the winner wasannounced during the press conference at agency headquarters -- that the initialcontract is structured into separate schedules for design , development , testingand evaluation ( DDT&E ) .
The contract for the initial part of the project , known as Schedule A , is slated to start Sept. 8 and run through Sept. 7 , 2013 .
Agency officials said that initial part of the contract would be worth $ 3.9 billion .
Thecontract also contains options for production of additional spacecraft andsustaining engineering .
If fullyexercised , the options contained in Schedule B would be worth another $ 3.5 billion .
The options for sustaining engineering contained in Schedule C couldbe worth as much as $ 750 million .
NASA saidmanufacturing and integration of the vehicle components will take place atcontractor facilities across the country .
LockheedMartin will perform the majority of the Orion vehicle engineering work atNASA 's Johnson Space Center , Houston , and completefinal assembly of the vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center , Fla .
All 10 NASAcenters will provide technical and engineering support to the project .
LockheedMartin Space Systems announcedearlier this year that if it won CEV , it would run the program fromHouston , bringing 1,200 new jobs to the area .
LockheedMartin has long dominated NASA 's robotic planetary spacecraft business and nowhas the opportunity to do the same in humanspaceflight .
LockheedMartin's major Orion teammates include : United Space Alliance of Houston , thejoint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing that operates the space shuttle ; Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles , Va. ; Honeywell Defense and Space ElectronicsSystems , Minneapolis ; and Hamilton Sundstrand of Windsor Locks , Conn .
NASA saidpost - development spacecraft delivery orders could begin as early as Sept. 8,2009 , and run through Sept. 7 , 2019 , if all options are exercised .
The agencysaid the estimated value of those orders will be negotiated based on futuremanifest requirements and knowledge gained through the DDT&E process .
Sustainingengineering work will be assigned through task orders .
That work is expected tooccur from Sept. 8 , 2009 , through Sept. 7 , 2019 .
" DuringDDT&E , NASA will use an end - item cost - plus - award - fee incentive contract .
This makes the award fee subject to final determination after the contractorhas demonstrated that it meets the technical , cost , and schedule requirementsof the contract , " the agency said in its release .
Orion willbe capable of transporting four crew members for lunar missions and latersupporting crew transfers for Mars missions , NASA said .
Orion also will be ableto carry up to six crew members to and from the international space station .
The firstOrion launch with humans on board is planned for no later than 2014 .
A humanMoon landing is expected to occur no later than 2020 , the agency said .
Caras " Skip " Hatfield , NASA 's Orion project manager , said that the current plan forthe spacecraft 's landing includes a primary land - based touchdown , with a waterlanding as a back - up option .
But that decision is not finalized at this point , he said .
" We 're assessing and making sure that 's the right answer , " he said .
Hatfieldsaid NASA is still determining what portions of the Orion spacecraft will bereusable , but noted that the heat shield that protects the vehicle duringatmospheric re-entry will always be replaced after each flight .
Surface Tension and the Hydraulic Jump
Circular Jumps and Crowns
Figure 1 : A small circular jump .
Figure 2 : A large circular jump .
Figure 3 : A turbulent circular jump with a crown .
The circular hydraulic jump may arise when a fluid jet falling vertically at high Reynolds number strikes a horizontal plate .
Fluid is expelled radially , and the layer generally thins until reaching a critical radius at which the layer depth increases abruptly .
Predictions for the jump radius based on inviscid theory were presented by Rayleigh ( 1914 ) .
The dominant influence of fluid viscosity on the jump radius was elucidated by Watson ( 1964 ) , who developed an appropriate description of the boundary layer that develops from the lower boundary .
We have recently examined the influence of surface tension on the circular hydraulic jump , both its size and stability , through a combined theoretical and experimental investigation .
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the laminar circular hydraulic jump , and Figure 3 shows a turbulent circular jump with a pronounced outer crown .

Everything You Know About Disks Is Wrong
Update II : NetApp has responded .
I ’m hoping other vendors will as well .
Which do you believe ?
Costly FC and SCSI drives are more reliable than cheap SATA drives .
RAID 5 is safe because the odds of two drives failing in the same RAID set are so low .
After infant mortality , drives are highly reliable until they reach the end of their useful life .
Vendor MTBF are a useful yardstick for comparing drives .
According to the one of the “ Best Paper ” awards at FAST ’07 , none of these are backed by empirical evidence .
Beyond Google
Yesterday ’s post discussed a Google - authored paper on disk failures .
But that was n’t the only cool storage paper .
Google ’s was n’t even the best : Bianca Schroeder of CMU ’s Parallel Data Lab paper
Disk failures in the real world :
What does an MTTF of 1,000,000 hours mean to you ?
won a “ Best Paper ” award .
( BTW , Ms. Schroeder is a post - doc looking for an academic position – but if I were Google or Amazon I ’d be after her in a big way . )
Best “ academic computer science ” paper
So it is very heavy on statistics , including some cool techniques like the “ auto - correlation function ” .
Dr. Schroeder explains :
The autocorrelation function ( ACF ) measures the correlation of a random variable with itself at different time lags l .
The ACF , for example , can be used to determine whether the number of failures in one day is correlated with the number of failures observed l days later .
Translation : ever wonder if a disk drive failure in an array makes it more likely that another drive will fail ?
ACF will tell you .
She looked at 100,000 drives
Including HPC clusters at Los Alamos and the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center , as well as several unnamed internet services providers .
The drives had different workloads , different definitions of “ failure ” and different levels of data collection so the data is n’t quite as smooth or complete as Google ’s .
Yet it probably looks more like a typical enterprise data center , IMHO .
Not all of the data could be used to draw all of the conclusions , but Dr. Schroeder appears to have been very careful in her statistical analysis .
Key observations from Dr. Schroeder ’s research :
High - end “ enterprise ” drives versus “ consumer ” drives ?
Interestingly , we observe little difference in replacement rates between SCSI , FC and SATA drives , potentially an indication that disk - independent factors , such as operating conditions , affect replacement rates more than component specific factors . ”
Maybe consumer stuff gets kicked around more .
Who knows ?
Infant mortality ?
. . . failure rate is not constant with age , and that , rather than a significant infant mortality effect , we see a significant early onset of wear - out degradation .
Dr. Schroeder did n’t see infant mortality – neither did Google – and she also found that drives just wear out steadily .
Vendor MTBF reliability ?
While the datasheet AFRs are between 0.58 % and 0.88 % , the observed ARRs range from 0.5 % to as high as 13.5 % .
That is , the observed ARRs by dataset and type , are by up to a factor of 15 higher than datasheet AFRs .
Most commonly , the observed ARR values are in the 3 % range .
Actual MTBFs ?
The weighted average ARR was 3.4 times larger than 0.88 % , corresponding to a datasheet MTTF of 1,000,000 hours . ”
In other words , that 1 million hour MTBF is really about 300,000 hours – about what consumer drives are spec’d at .
Drive reliability after burn-in ?
Contrary to common and proposed models , hard drive replacement rates do not enter steady state after the first year of operation .
Instead replacement rates seem to steadily increase over time .
Drives get old , fast .
Data safety under RAID 5 ?
. . . a key application of the exponential assumption is in estimating the time until data loss in a RAID system .
This time depends on the probability of a second disk failure during reconstruction , a process which typically lasts on the order of a few hours .
The . . . exponential distribution greatly underestimates the probability of a second failure . . . . the probability of seeing two drives in the cluster fail within one hour is four times larger under the real data . . . .
Independence of drive failures in an array ?
The distribution of time between disk replacements exhibits decreasing hazard rates , that is , the expected remaining time until the next disk was replaced grows with the time it has been since the last disk replacement .
Translation : one array drive failure means a much higher likelihood of another drive failure .
The longer since the last failure , the longer to the next failure .
Magic !
Big iron array reliability is illusory
One implication of Schroeder ’s results is that big iron arrays only appear more reliable .
How ?
Using smaller “ enterprise ” drives means that rebuilds take less time .
That makes RAID 5 failures due to the loss of a second disk less likely .
So array vendors not only get higher margins from smaller enterprise disks , they also get higher perceived reliability under RAID 5 , for which they also charge more money .
The StorageMojo take
After these two papers neither disk drive or array businesses will ever be the same .
Storage is very conservative , so do n’t expect overnight change , but these papers will accelerate the consumerization of large - scale storage .
High - end drives still have advantages , but those fictive MTBFs are n’t one of them anymore .
Further , these results validate the Google File System ’s central redundancy concept : forget RAID , just replicate the data three times .
If I ’m an IT architect , the idea that I can spend less money and get higher reliability from simple cluster storage file replication should be very attractive .
Comments welcome , especially from disk drive and array vendors who dispute these conclusions .
Moderation turned on to protect the innocent .
Update : Garth Gibson ’s name is also on the paper .
Since he is busy as a CMU professor and CTO of Panasas , I hope he ’ll pardon me for assuming that Dr. Schroeder deserves most of the credit .
The World Economic Forum takes place this week in Davos , Switzerland , and leaders around the world gather to discuss issues like the Iraq war , global climate change , and globalization — along with the incredible prevalence of botnets .
The BBC's Tim Weber , who was in the audience of an Internet panel featuring Vint Cerf , Michael Dell , John Markoff of the New York Times , and Jon Zittrain of Oxford , came away most impressed by the botnet statistics .
Cerf told his listeners that approximately 600 million computers are connected to the Internet , and that 150 million of them might be participants in a botnet — nearly all of them unwilling victims .
Weber remarks that " in most cases the owners of these computers have not the slightest idea what their little beige friend in the study is up to . "
If Cerf 's estimate is accurate , that 's one quarter of all machines connected to the Internet .
So is the Internet doomed ?
Well , you 're reading this , so no , not yet .
But the botnet menace is no phantom , and it has been growing in strength for years .
In September 2006 , security research firm Arbor Networks announced that it was now seeing botnet - based denial of service attacks capable of generating an astonishing 10 - 20 Gbps of junk data .
The company notes that when major attacks of this sort began , ISPs often do exactly what the attacker wants them to do : take the target site offline .
What is it that keeps the " botherders " so fascinated with amassing large flocks like modern - day , digital shepherds ?
Money .
Once millions of " little beige friends " have been compromised with bot software , the creators can then use or rent the network to deliver spam , denial of service attacks , and log passwords and usernames .
All of these uses can be lucrative if you know the right wrong people .
Several months ago , Wired published a great story about the extended botnet attack on Blue Security that captures the shadowy nature of the botnet world .
Even after weeks of attacks and public tauntings from the spammer behind them , neither the security firm nor its ISPs could fully halt the attacks or identify the person who was launching them .
In the end , Blue Security folded .
Botnets have been behind a significant increase in spam in recent months , and some security vendors have warned that these networks are now large enough to pose a potential threat to major government networks ( at least those which operate or are connected to the public Internet ) .
It can be difficult to locate and prosecute botnet operators .
Blue Security officials believed that their antagonist was in Russia , but American teenagers have also been involved in the practice , and several have been prosecuted .
Two were sentenced last year to 57 and 37 months in jail , respectively — sentences designed to send a message that the government is serious about the issue .
SBCL perspective #
hacking , December 2nd 2006
As you 've undoubtedly heard by now , SBCL 1.0 is out with plenty of improvements , so I figured this might be a nice time for a personal SBCL & Common Lisp retrospective .
My first introduction to lisp in the form of Scheme was in the autumn of 1996 at the university , on the SICP course .
While I learnt a great deal on that course , Scheme really did n't stick .
It was n't until late 2002 that I got my first taste of CL .
I do n't remember the first contact , but I do remember the first time I happened on CMUCL .
What ?
An optimizing native compiler for a language this dynamic and cool ?
What is this , some sort of a joke ?
And this thing seems to have been around since forever !
Why have I not heard of this before ?!
Then , over the Christmas holidays 2002 I rewrote my toy raytracer in CL ( for CMUCL ) .
While the performance did suffer , it did n't suffer too much for my purposes — and my code was typical newbie code .
Not too great CL , and not too well optimized .
No matter .
I was in love .
For a while I tried both SBCL and CMUCL , and gave GCL and Clisp a try too .
How and when I picked up SBCL for good , I do n't really remember , but I think I was hooked by touching the source .
My first patch ( a trivial build fix ) appears on sbcl - devel on 31st of May 2003 , just a few weeks after my first question on sbcl - help ( which seems to indicate I was definitely using both CMUCL and SBCL ) .
Then , several patches and a year or so later I was blessed with commit access in May 2004 , and the rest , as they say , is history .
Just a couple of short years later , here I am , trying to make a living out of my mad SBCL skillz .
So , what makes SBCL so utterly cool that spending all that time on it was n't a waste ?
Successor to CMUCL , probably .
For a long time I would have hesitated in saying this , but not any more .
Unless CMUCL gets re-invigorated with new developers it will ( sadly ) be ultimately superseded by SBCL for all practical purposes — so for the time being , SBCL is the only portable open source highly optimizing Common Lisp compiler of note with a future in my books .
This is not slam on CMUCL or CMUCL devs .
They have done great work and keep doing great work , and the cross-pollination between SBCL and CMUCL has benefited both .
I just do n't personally believe CMUCL has another decade in it left , whereas SBCL almost certainly has .

Number crunching .
Writing good numeric code in CL takes some skill , but once that is obtained SBCL can do very well indeed — and is getting better all the time .
CMUCL is on par , and AFAIK ACL is quite competitive too , but does n't allow inlining of user - defined functions .
Scieneer is probably on par or better , considering its heritage .

Scieneer is probably on par or better , considering its heritage .
Hackability .
SBCL is easy to build , and once you get your bearings quite hackable .
Deep parts of the compiler remain deep parts of the compiler , but getting your bottleneck optimized or having the niggling library bug taken care of is n't usually all that hard .
And being not just open source , but mostly in public domain you really do n't have any licence issues what so ever .

Package locks .
If you ask me , SBCL is the only Common Lisp that gets package locking mostly right .
But I would say that , would I not ?

Timeboxed releases .
SBCL releases once a month .
This means that even without following the bleeding edge you do n't have to wait long for your bugfixes to appear in an official release .
( The downside is that incompatible changes can sometimes happen in rapid succession too , which is where my company Steel Bank Studio Ltd can help you by maintaining a stable release that gets backported patches but does n't break source - compatibility .
Get in touch — the rates are quite reasonable . )

SMP threads .
As far as I know only SBCL , OpenMCL , and Scieneer offer SMP lisp threads .
While SBCL 's threading does still have some issues , the work is progressing , and quite some people seem to be happily using them too .
( Note that I would not with good conscience at this point recommend using SBCL threading with CLOS heavy code in a critical application , but I 'm hoping to drop this reservation in a month or few . )

Smart people .
I really like most of the people associated with SBCL because they make me feel slow and stupid .
That may appear a strange sentiment , but it really is a quality you should appreciate in your co-developers .
As they say , there are two kinds of people : those who prefer the company of people more intelligent then them , and those who prefer the company of people less intelligent then them ...
Is that all ?
Of course not !
There is modular arithmetic using standard CL operators .
There is a rather dynamic FFI supporting callbacks .
There is a sampling profiler that also does allocation profiling .
There ...
Hm .
That was one undirected ramble .
Sorry about that .
Some of America 's leading scientists have accused Republican politicians of intimidating climate - change experts by placing them under unprecedented scrutiny .
A far - reaching inquiry into the careers of three of the US 's most senior climate specialists has been launched by Joe Barton , the chairman of the House of Representatives committee on energy and commerce .
He has demanded details of all their sources of funding , methods and everything they have ever published .
Mr Barton , a Texan closely associated with the fossil - fuel lobby , has spent his 11 years as chairman opposing every piece of legislation designed to combat climate change .
He is using the wide powers of his committee to force the scientists to produce great quantities of material after alleging flaws and lack of transparency in their research .
He is working with Ed Whitfield , the chairman of the sub - committee on oversight and investigations .
The scientific work they are investigating was important in establishing that man-made carbon emissions were at least partly responsible for global warming , and formed part of the 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which convinced most world leaders - George Bush was a notable exception - that urgent action was needed to curb greenhouse gases .
The demands in letters sent to the scientists have been compared by some US media commentators to the anti-communist " witch - hunts " pursued by Joe McCarthy in the 1950s .
The three US climate scientists - Michael Mann , the director of the Earth System Science Centre at Pennsylvania State University ; Raymond Bradley , the director of the Climate System Research Centre at the University of Massachusetts ; and Malcolm Hughes , the former director of the Laboratory of Tree - Ring Research at the University of Arizona - have been told to send large volumes of material .
A letter demanding information on the three and their work has also gone to Arden Bement , the director of the US National Science Foundation .
Mr Barton 's inquiry was launched after an article in the Wall Street Journal quoted an economist and a statistician , neither of them from a climate science background , saying there were methodological flaws and data errors in the three scientists ' calculations .
It accused the trio of refusing to make their original material available to be cross-checked .
Mr Barton then asked for everything the scientists had ever published and all baseline data .
He said the information was necessary because Congress was going to make policy decisions drawing on their work , and his committee needed to check its validity .
There followed a demand for details of everything they had done since their careers began , funding received and procedures for data disclosure .
The inquiry has sent shockwaves through the US scientific establishment , already under pressure from the Bush administration , which links funding to policy objectives .
Eighteen of the country 's most influential scientists from Princeton and Harvard have written to Mr Barton and Mr Whitfield expressing " deep concern " .
Their letter says much of the information requested is unrelated to climate science .
It says : " Requests to provide all working materials related to hundreds of publications stretching back decades can be seen as intimidation - intentional or not - and thereby risks compromising the independence of scientific opinion that is vital to the pre-eminence of American science as well as to the flow of objective science to the government . "
Alan Leshner protested on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , expressing " deep concern " about the inquiry , which appeared to be " a search for a basis to discredit the particular scientists rather than a search for understanding " .
Political reaction has been stronger .
Henry Waxman , a senior Californian Democrat , wrote complaining that this was a " dubious " inquiry which many viewed as a " transparent effort to bully and harass climate - change experts who have reached conclusions with which you disagree " .
But the strongest language came from another Republican , Sherwood Boehlert , the chairman of the house science committee .
He wrote to " express my strenuous objections to what I see as the misguided and illegitimate investigation " .
He said it was pernicious to substitute political review for scientific peer review and the precedent was " truly chilling " .
He said the inquiry " seeks to erase the line between science and politics " and should be reconsidered .
A spokeswoman for Mr Barton said yesterday that all the required written evidence had been collected .
" The committee will review everything we have and decided how best to proceed .
No decision has yet been made whether to have public hearings to investigate the validity of the scientists ' findings , but that could be the next step for this autumn , " she said .
It looks dull , almost impenetrable in places .
But if its findings are verified , it could turn out to be the most important scientific report published so far this year .
In this month 's edition of the Journal of Hydrometeorology is a paper written by scientists at the Met Office , which predicts future patterns of rainfall and evaporation .
Those who dispute that climate change is taking place , such as Melanie Phillips of the Daily Mail , like to point out that that the predicted effects of global warming rely on computer models , rather than " observable facts " .
That 's the problem with the future - you can't observe it .
But to have any hope of working out what might happen , you need a framework of understanding .
It 's either this or the uninformed guesswork that Phillips seems to prefer .
The models can be tested by means of what climate scientists call backcasting - seeing whether or not they would have predicted changes that have already taken place .
The global climate model used by the Met Office still needs to be refined .
While it tracks past temperature changes pretty closely , it does not accurately backcast the drought patterns in every region .
But it correctly reproduces the total global water trends over the past 50 years .
When the same model is used to forecast the pattern over the 21st century , it uncovers " a net overall global drying trend " if greenhouse gas emissions are moderate or high .
" On a global basis , drought events are slightly more frequent and of much longer duration by the second half of the 21st century relative to the present day . "
In these dry , stodgy phrases , we find an account of almost unimaginable future misery .
Many parts of the world , for reasons that have little to do with climate change , are already beginning to lose their water .
In When the Rivers Run Dry , Fred Pearce , who is New Scientist 's environment consultant , travels around the world trying to assess the state of our water resources .
He finds that we survive today as a result of borrowing from the future .
The great famines predicted for the 1970s were averted by new varieties of rice , wheat and maize , whose development was known as the " green revolution " .
They produce tremendous yields , but require plenty of water .
This has been provided by irrigation , much of which uses underground reserves .
Unfortunately , many of them are being exploited much faster than they are being replenished .
In India , for example , some 250 cubic kilometres ( a cubic kilometre is a billion cubic metres or a trillion litres ) are extracted for irrigation every year , of which about 150 are replaced by the rain .
" Two hundred million people [ are ] facing a waterless future .
The groundwater boom is turning to bust and , for some , the green revolution is over . "
In China , 100 million people live on crops grown with underground water that is not being refilled : water tables are falling fast all over the north China plain .
Many more rely on the Huang He ( the Yellow river ) , which already appears to be drying up as a result of abstraction and , possibly , climate change .
Around 90 % of the crops in Pakistan are watered by irrigation from the Indus .
Almost all the river 's water is already diverted into the fields - it often fails now to reach the sea .
The Ogallala aquifer that lies under the western and south - western United States , and which has fed much of the world , has fallen by 30 metres in many places .
It now produces half as much water as it did in the 1970s .
All this was known before the new paper was published .
While climate scientists have been predicting for some time that the wet parts of the world are likely to become wetter and the dry parts drier , they had assumed that overall rainfall would rise , as higher temperatures increase evaporation .
At the same time - and for the same reason - soils could become drier .
It was unclear what the net effects would be .
But the new paper 's " drought index " covers both rainfall and evaporation : overall , the world becomes drier .
Even this account - of rising demand and falling supply - does not tell the whole grim story .
Roughly half the world 's population lives within 60 kilometres of the coast .
Eight of the 10 largest cities on earth have been built beside the sea .
Many of them rely on underground lenses of fresh water , effectively floating , within the porous rocks , on salt water which has soaked into the land from the sea .
As the fresh water is sucked out , the salt water rises and can start to contaminate the aquifer .
This is already happening in hundreds of places .
The worst case is the Gaza Strip , which relies entirely on underground water that is now almost undrinkable .
As the sea level rises as a result of climate change , salt pollution in coastal regions is likely to accelerate .
As these two effects of climate change - global drying and rising salt pollution - run up against the growing demand for water , and as irrigation systems run dry or become contaminated , the possibility arises of a permanent global food deficit .
Even with a net food surplus , 800 million people are malnourished .
Nothing I could write would begin to describe what a world in deficit - carrying 9 billion people - would look like .
There are four possible means of adapting to this crisis .
One is to abandon regions that are drying up and shift production to the wettest parts of the world - the Amazon and Congo basins , for example .
But as these are generally the most forested places , this will lead to a great acceleration of climate change , and of the global drying it 's likely to cause , as the carbon in the trees is turned to carbon dioxide .
Another is to invest in desalination plants .
But even the new desalination technologies produce expensive water , and they use a great deal of energy .
Again this means more global warming .
Another is to shift water , on a massive scale , to the drying lands .
But vast hydro - engineering projects have seldom succeeded in helping the poor .
Giant dams and canals - like the Narmada system in India , the Three Gorges in China and Colonel Gadafy 's " Great Man-Made River " - are constructed at stupendous cost .
Then , when no further glory can be extracted by the government officials and companies who built them , the fiddly work of ensuring the water reaches the poor is forgotten , and the money is wasted .
As Fred Pearce shows , perhaps the best method , which in the past has kept cities alive even in the Negev desert , is the small - scale capture of rainwater in ponds and tanks .
But to stand a high chance of averting this catastrophe , we must ensure that the drying does n't happen .
The predictions in the new paper refer to global warming in the middle or at the high end of the expected range .
Beneath that point - 2C of warming or so - a great global drying is less likely to occur .
As the figures I 've published show , to keep the rise in temperature below this level requires a global cut in carbon emissions of 60 % by 2030 - which means a 90 % reduction in rich nations such as the United Kingdom .
It sounds ridiculous .
But then you consider the alternative .

I am always floored by the number of progressives who embrace all kinds of wacky non-scientific health theories .
These are the same folks who criticize creationists as being anti-scientific .
I am not a creationist , but I might be able to embrace it faster than I could , say , the insanity that is homeopathic medicine **.
Unfortunately , these are the same folks who will likely make up the backbone of the socialized medicine bureaucracy when and if the US finally decides to hand health care over to a consortium of the Post Office and Walther Reed .
So here is a preview of what we will get :
Tom and Donna ( not their real names ) are professional
shamen .
They teach classes in shamanism at a " foundation " , where you
can learn " soul retrieval healing " , help the dead " continue their
journey into the Hereafter " , and investigate " the Fairy Kingdom " .
These
soul retrievers and Fairy Kingdom investigators also work for the NHS " ”
where , according to Tom 's foundation profile , they " use complementary
therapies to help those with mental health difficulties " .
Shaman
therapies are not the only unorthodox treatments for which the NHS will
gladly pay .
Taxpayers are also subsidising Emotional
Freedom Technique ( EFT ) " therapy " , in which , according to one NHS
trust , " subtle energies " are reordered via " tapping with the fingertips
to stimulate certain meridian energy points while the client is " ˜tuned
in ' to the problem " .
" ¦If EFT does n't do the job , an NHS foot massage
might help .
Reflexologists believe that each part of the foot maps to a
different organ , and that massaging a particular point can treat that
organ .
Medical doctors think it 's absurd .
" ¦Most depressing of all for
the rational taxpayer is the NHS Directory for Alternative and
Complementary Medicine , which aims to promote " dowsers " , " flower
therapists " and " crystal healers " .
We 've just learnt that some
hospitals are removing every third light bulb to save money , and that
nurses are being paid half the minimum wage " ” or being asked to work
for nothing " ” at others .
That 's how bad the financial crisis has
become .
Meanwhile , the National Health Service is employing shaman
fairy enthusiasts as psychological counsellors , enthusiastically
providing treatments invented by " an ordained minister and a personal
performance coach " who thinks tapping your body can cure diabetes ,
promoting dowsers and crystal healers and spending vast amounts on
therapies that can't be scientifically supported .
Just as with the Walther Reed mess , the left wants to write off this stuff as just bad management , as an exception .
But unfortunately , this is the rule for government management .
It always goes bad .
Mismatched incentives + lack of individual choice + strong unionized bureaucracy most concerned with its own job security + impossibly complex information flows = mess .
Always .
I get very tired of the excuse , as I wrote here , that " if only we were in charge , everything would work great . "
Throughout these years , libertarians like myself argued that there
were at least three problems with all of this technocratic statism :
You do n't have the right to make decisions for other people .
Period .
No matter how high - minded and idealistic you want to portray
it , at the end of the day you are proposing to use force to coerce
another man into doing your will .
You may stop them from using force
or fraud against others , but an adult may make decisions for
themselves , even if they are bad .
I am reminded of a great line from
the HBO show Deadwood , " Can you let me go to hell the way I want to ? "
You can't make better decisions for other people , even if you
are smarter , because every person has different wants , needs , values ,
etc. , and thus make trade - offs differently .
Tedy Bruschi of the
Patriots is willing to take post - stroke risks by playing pro football again I would never take , but that does n't mean its a incorrect decision for him .
Technocratic idealists ALWAYS lose control of the game .
It may
feel good at first when the trains start running on time , but the
technocrats are soon swept away by the thugs , and the patina of
idealism is swept away , and only fascism is left .
Interestingly , the
technocrats always cry " our only mistake was letting those other guys
take control " .
No , the mistake was accepting the right to use force on
another man .
Everything after that was inevitable .
Everyone has had a turn running the place ( except libertarians , I might observe ) and everyone has screwed things up .
** I am amazed I have not posted a rant on homeopathic medicine , but searching through my archives , I do n't find anything .
If you do n't know , here is the fast answer why homeopathy is silly .
Advocates of homeopathy argue that they can make certain substances more effective by diluting them , and the more they dilute them , the more effective they are .
Go to one of their web sites , and you will see dilution rations that translate into having less than one molecule of the active ingredient in a mass of water the volume of all the world 's oceans .
Advocates argue that even though the molecules are gone , some sort of resonance remains .
Uhh , right .

I listened to an IT - Coversations podcast from SuperNova 2006 a few days ago about games and education .
The most interesting part of the podcast were the notes by Amy Jo Kim describing how games get their players addicted to them , and how those techniques could be applied to learning environments or any systems .
In the social web the largest challenge usually is starting a new community .
Adding the “ game appeal ” of the site may help .
The main appeal - increasing features seen in games and many social software applications as well are :
Collecting stuff : Items in WoW , links in del.icio.us , connections in Linked Id , furniture in Habbo Hotel …
Allowing users to collect various things into their virtual environment will appeal to many collector - minded people , and will increase their tendency to continue using the system .
Earning points :
The old wisdom is that any visible meter becomes a goal to people , so it is important to carefully design those meters .
Earning points can be based on some rules in the system ( WoW experience levels ) , or they can be social in nature ( Linked In recommendations , Ebay ratings ) .
Feedback : Feedback on the progress on any meter should be provided multimodally ( visual , auditive , tactile ? ) , often , and in interesting ways .
This keeps people going with the system .
Social exchanges :
The visibility of the community and people is important .
It is also important to allow the community members to communicate .
Exchanging any kind of communications or tokens ( blog comments , eBay ratings , Habbo Hotel presents , WoW chats ) is essential for a community to flourish .
Customization : Making the environment look like you want is an important way to add a feeling of ownership to the user .
Customization of the user interface is an easy way of doing that .
Also customizing your character ( WoW avatar , community profile ) and tailoring how things work and optimizing the things you see are also important affordances .
Allow for emergence :
Do not overdesign the system and force people to work in a certain way .
Most communities will surprise the original designers of the system .
So make the system open enough to allow emerging behaviour , and be ready to modify your system to better support these emerging patterns .
James Hinchcliffe will pilot the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda for Andretti Autosport for the remainder of the 2020 season , following Zach Veach ‘s departure from the team on Wednesday .
Hinchcliffe has already run three events with Andretti this season , piloting the No. 29 Genesys Honda for the season opening Genesys 300 at Texas Motor Speedway , the GMR Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course , and the Indianapolis 500 .
The “ Mayor of Hinchtown ” also raced for Andretti from 2012 to 2014 , and team owner Michael Andretti credits their relationship with the Canadian driver as the reason why he was chosen .
“ It ’s always unfortunate to have to change drivers this far into a season , but we have to look at finishing the year the best we can for the 26 team and start evaluating and looking at options for 2021 , ” Andretti said .
“ James has an existing relationship with … Read the rest

Due to popular demand , Dave Jeffery has taken some of the Flash clocks from part two and turned them into Windows screensavers .
ABC Clock ABC broadcast at the weekends , serving both the Midlands and the North of England .
This clock was for joint continuity , parts of the programme schedule where both regions were showing the same programmes .
It was broadcast from the ABC studios in Teddington , Middlesex and would be seen , for example , before World of Sport on Saturdays .
ABC Clock - Midlands
The second ABC clock was seen only by viewers in the Midlands .
ABC Clock - North
And finally , an ABC clock seen only by viewers in the North .
ATV Clock 1
ATV Clock 2 ATV 's digital clock was the last image broadcast by the company as it closed down for the final time , 34 minutes into the first day of 1982 .
Later that morning , Central was born .
Its clock used the same digits , this time superimposed onto a Central caption .
You can choose the clock with a black background or the more common blue background .
( Or if you can't decide , download both ! )
BBC 1 Clock - electronically generated
This is BBC 1's first virtual clock .
The image was generated by a box of electronics , designed in house by Richard Russell .
Similar hardware was then used for the other BBC solid state clocks featured below .
BBC 1 Clock - electronically generated II
The second virtual clock for BBC 1 first appeared in February 1985 .
It was introduced to accompany the new golden globe symbol or COW ( Computer - Originated World ) as it was known at the BBC .
BBC 2 Clock - electronically generated
This is BBC 2's first virtual clock .
The move to electronic generation meant that the network symbol underneath the clock face could finally be shown with all of the colour shades on the stripes .
I 'm reliably informed that when Roly Keating , who became Controller of BBC Two in June 2004 , first saw this screensaver , he decided he had to have it installed on his own PC !
Border Clock
This is Border Television 's mechanical clock , used in the Eighties .
It features the company 's " chopsticks in a bowl " symbol .
Channel 4 Clock Martin Lambie - Nairn and his company were responsible for Channel 4's identity when the station launched in 1982 .
Since then his company has become a major force in television branding .
This is the Channel 4 clock , which features the stripy 4 logo .
For some reason they decided to use a dark blue rather than the main logo 's light blue .
HTV Clock
When colour came to the Wales and West region in 1970 , Harlech became HTV and its famous " aerial " logo was born .
To go with the new white - on - blue symbol was this white - on - blue clock , which lasted well over a decade .
Rediffusion Clock - Black
Rediffusion Clock
In 1964 Rediffusion began using an ident that ended with the rotating " adastral " star on a completely black background .
This was later superseded by another that ended on a grey background .
These two clocks match those idents .
Southern Clock
This was a clock used by Southern after the station began its colour service .
The clock was still in use in 1981 , the company 's final year of broadcasting .
Thames Clock Thames
Television 's clock also told you the date as well as the time .
It was used until the end of the Eighties , when the Thames mirrored skyline ident was dropped and the ITV " corporate look " began .
TSW Clock TSW promoted itself as " Television Simply Wonderful " on its opening night in 1982 .
It ceased broadcasting ten years later , having lost its licence at the next franchise round .
This computer - generated clock was TSW 's only timepiece throughout its decade on air .
TVS Clock
The second clock design used by TVS , which served the South and South East from 1982 until the end of 1992 .
Sometimes the caption would say " TVS South " or " TVS South East " , when different presentation was being transmitted in each of the two TVS sub -regions .
Tyne Tees Clock
This clock was introduced when Tyne Tees began broadcasting in colour in 1970 .
As well as white - on - blue , other colour schemes were experimented with such as light - blue - on - black .
Westward Clock
For some reason , Westward 's clock , used until it ceased broadcasting in 1981 , reminds me of one of those wooden - framed clocks you used to see on the wall inside banks .
The exploded pie-chart style ( with the bottom right - hand quarter of the rounded rectangle separated from the rest ) was also seen on continuity slides for much of the seventies .
Yorkshire Clock - Gold Seen in 1977 , this clock from Yorkshire Television features golden lettering .
Yorkshire Clock
This was Yorkshire 's first computer - generated clock .
It was a replacement for a mechanical clock of a similar design .
From the moment that we are born to this world , we start learning and we do not stop until we pass from this world .

Shoplifting Facts .
A crime and occurs when someone steals merchandise offered for sale in a retail store .
To commit shoplifting one must “ intend ” to permanently deprive the merchant of the value of the merchandise .
Shoplifting most often occurs by concealing merchandise in a purse , pocket , or bag , but can occur by a variety of methods .
Most shoplifters are amateurs .
However , there are growing numbers of organized theft rings and people who make their living by stealing from retail stores .
Amateur shoplifters can be highly skilled , and some steal almost every day but do n’t do it to make a living .
Most amateurs are opportunistic , crude in their methods , and are detected more often than others .
Professional shoplifters run the gamut from being highly skilled to thug - like .
Some professionals work in teams or use elaborate distraction scenarios .
The crude professionals sometimes use force and fear much like gang intimidation and often commit grab - and - run thefts .
Being a professional means that they steal merchandise for a living , and like other trades , practice makes perfect .
Thoughtful professionals are very difficult to stop in a society where retail stores openly display their merchandise .
Shoplifter Profile
Shoplifters come in all shapes and sizes , ages and sexes , and vary in ethnic background , education , and economic status .
Some shoplifters steal for the excitement , some steals out of desire , some steal for need , some steals out of peer pressure , and some steal because it is simply a business transaction to them .
Some shoplifters are compulsive , some opportunistic , and some are mentally ill and do n’t know any better .
Some shoplifters are desperate from drug addiction , alcoholism , or from living on the street .
Children and elderly persons sometimes steal without realizing they are committing a crime .
Most shoplifters try to rationalize their crime by thinking the large retailer can afford the loss .
In urban cities , it is not unusual to find a network of fences that send out teams of shoplifters into specific retail stores to shoplift specific items , much like filling an order for a customer .
These fences only pay 10 - 20 cents on the dollar to the thieves , but sometimes pay their room , board , and provide training on how to steal and defeat the anti-theft technology .
Some fences have been known to bail their workers out of jail when caught or provide for their legal defense .
This creates a kind of strange street loyalty much like the tale of Oliver Twist .
Shoplifting Facts : Real Cost of Retail Theft
Theft from stores , including employee and vendor theft , cost retailers many billions of dollars per year .
Independent retail studies * have estimated theft from retail stores costs the American public 33.21 billion dollars per year .
Depending on the type of retail store , retail inventory loss ranges from .7 % - 2.2 % of gross sales with the average falling around 1.70 % .
Whole retail store chains have gone out of business due to their inability to control retail theft losses .
And worse yet , the cost of these losses are passed on to us …the consumer .
Shoplifting losses vary by store type but can account for about one - third of the total inventory shrinkage .
It is estimated that shoplifting occurs 330 – 440 million times per year at a loss of $ 10 - $ 13 billion dollars .
Nationwide , that equates to 1.0 - 1.2 million shoplift incidents every day at a loss rate of $ 19,000 - $ 25,300 dollars stolen per minute .
When you factor in employee and vendor theft , this sum skyrockets to an estimate of over $ 33 billion dollars stolen per year .
Shoplifting Facts : Prevention
To combat these losses , merchants have had to take sometimes extreme measures to control shoplifting .
Most large retailers employ plain - clothes floor detectives to observe customers as they shop .
Many shoplifters are detained and arrested for their indiscretions .
See our webpage on Shoplifting Detention and Arrest .
Plain - clothes floor detectives alone are not enough of a deterrent because they are seemingly invisible .
Many stores use video surveillance cameras and electronic article surveillance ( EAS ) devices attached to their products that cause alarms to go off if not deactivated by the cashier .
Others secure expensive and high theft items like small leather items , perfume , cosmetics , tools , liquor , or cigarettes in locked enclosures .
Other retailers use cables or hanger locks that require the assistance of a sales associate to unlock the expensive item of clothing before you can inspect it .
It is important for us to know these facts and be patient with stores that try to control their losses due to theft .
It can be annoying when a store sales associate has to first count your items before you enter and after you exit the dressing room .
It can be annoying when the item you wish to try on has an electronic security device attached to it and sometimes spoils the look of the item .
It can be annoying when a sales associate appears to be “ dogging ” you within the department , seeming to watch your every move .
If any or all of these tactics make you feel uncomfortable , imagine how the shoplifter feels .
Shoplifters want product accessibility , privacy , and prefer stores with few anti-theft methods in place .
It is unfortunate , but anti-theft procedures sometimes affect the shopping experience for all of us , especially if applied thoughtlessly .
Shoplifting Facts : Detention
The practice of physically detaining and arresting shoplifters is not without risk .
Besides the physical contact that is sometimes necessary to stop an aggressive shoplifter , a merchant has the legal risk of being sued for doing so incorrectly .
In America , customers get outraged when they feel they are being watched or if they are questioned about a suspicious transaction .
Many merchants have been sued by their former customers for allegations of false arrest , false imprisonment , malicious prosecution , excessive use of force , and assault .
See our webpage entitled , Shoplifting Probable Cause for more information on universally accepted shoplifter detention policies to limit the potential for being sued .

Evaluating Crime Foreseeability and Inadequate Security Cases
Noah Nordrum is n't proud of what he 's become .
He is now , officially , a cracker .
I mean , " kr@xx0rs . "
Err , I think .
I do n't know .
I got that from my " 3773 Speek " guide .
As the " computer whiz " of the family , Noah is responsible for solving any technical problem that an aunt , grandparent , or second cousin may have , ranging from " funny symbols in my Word " ( Show Formatting turned on ) to " blinking 12:00 on the VCR " ( do n't look at me , I do n't know how to fix that ) .
Obviously , he 's never heard of my sure - fire way of avoiding the " family tech support " role : just tell your relatives that you work only with mainframes .
The kind that takes up an entire room , prints on green - bar paper , and has a whole bunch of blinking lights .
Trust me , it works .
That 's what most people think The Internet looks like .
On a recent " support call , " one of Noah 's relatives was having a seemingly basic problem .
She wanted to retrieve notes from program she was using for her legal case files but was receiving an error message when trying to start it up .
This problem looked like it just might be as difficult to solve as Aunt Josie 's " please insert the second disk to continue the installation " dilemma of 2004 .
Noah called up Brian and was greeted with a simple " Hello . "
He inquired about renewing the Legalese Pro software and received this terse reply :
" Sorry bud , I do n't do that any more .
Ca n't offer ya' any help with it , either .
Gotta run . Adios ! "
Noah reported this to his relative .
" Well , duh !
I could 've told you that , " she replied , " I was hoping you extract the notes from the database into Excel or something . "
Wow !
There 's a relative who not only knows the words " extract , " " database , " and " Excel , " but actually used them properly ?
Looks like the Nordrums have a new computer whiz .
Noah headed on over and got to work .
He went straight into the program directory , hoping to find a database .
Instead he found a file named licence .key .
It seemed like a good place to start , so he opened it up in Notepad :
! Legalese Pro License File - Do Not Modify !
Generated Mon Jan 24 21:17:47 EST 2001 expiration - date = 07-31-2005 key = 78c52ab4f6244475fb7ebefb21b7111c
Could it really be that easy ?
He changed the date to 2010 , saved the file , and started up the program .
Drat !
A System Error .
Err ... wait a second ... that " Was " value looks awfully familiar .
Maybe replacing the key field in the licence .key file with the " Expected Value " just might do the trick ...
Yup .
You guessed it .
Legalese Pro fired right up and worked like a champ .
Who woulda thought that becoming a " 3773 kr@xx0rs " would be so easy ?
And for some bonus content , August 29th is officially Jed Day .
Well , " bonus " if you have n't read it already ; it 's a " classic " if you have .
Was gonna post this when I started working on another comic .
Well I 'm working on another comic .
Made this one quite a while ago while expecting a new site with some other people .
So the art is a bit out of date .
The next one will be entirely In Clip Studio .
Which is my hole it was made for me .
You might notice there are no Ads .
I do n't know how to manage ads in a way that is n't information peddling .
They 've changed a lot from when I 've started .
Do n't think I 'm okay with what they are anymore .
Also not de-listing Super Effective .
Just forgot to link to it .
Peace .
New Site ?
Sorta !

Temporary site while we get the wordpress one up and going and WHOA AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM .
It 's been a bit since I updated and I needed to take the break .
I talk about it a bit more on my twitter but that 's about all I 'm willing to share .
It was a dark time that I 've learned from and I absolutely did not want to tell jokes during .
( I also do ask for privacy , as that 's all I 'm willing to share , thanks )
Fast forward to now and I do feel like making things again .
Drawing porn was good as it took my mind off being funny .
Now I enjoy getting better at it .
It 's something I think I can be good at .
It 's also introduced me to Clip Studio which has been INVALUABLE .
If you 're using Photoshop to draw , you NEED to try it .
But yeah , sorry for not being here for a while .
Needed to be away and thank you for sticking around . :)
Working on a few scripts but I am still a bit rusty .
Main project is a story I 'm doing on Patreon .
It 's a story about when they first moved together .
It 'll be released on here when it 's done but it might take a bit to finish .
And of course I 'm doing the LEWDS .
My twitter for that is pretty active for updates .
But yeah between a shit start to the year and lockdown it 's been hectic .
^_^ ;
Always a scramble for time but , I hate the idea of not creating .
So I fill the free time with art .
Super Effective sadly I can't continue .
Time / motivation just is n't there .
Thank you for taking the time to read it . :)
Now ...
Lets just hope this all uploads correctly .
Ploščo bo izdala založba Aquarius Records , ki je že nekaj mesecev zaposlena samo s tem glasbenim projektom , o tem kako napreduje snemanje pa ne želijo dajati uradnih izjav za medije .
Jinxi so priprave na snemanje začeli že v začetku poletja , avtorja večine pesmi pa sta Gordan Muratović Coki ter Jadranka Ivaniš Yaya .
To je za Večernji list z nasmeškom na obrazu potrdila tudi sama pevka , vendar je nato tudi hitro dodala :
„ Zaenkrat so to samo še ugibanja in predpostavke , zato o vsem tem še ne bi rada dajala nikakršnih izjav . “ je rekla Yaya .
V teh dneh je pevka in slikarka skupaj s svojim soprogom Dubravkom Ivanišom Ripperjem , sicer frontmanom hrvaške skupine Pips , Chips & Videoclips , ter njuno hčerko Lucijo , na zasluženem dopustu v najeti hiši na Visu .
Medtem ko sta Coki in Yay ponovno v „ akciji “ , pa še ni povsem jasno ali bo bend deloval v isti zasedbi .
Kakorkoli že , oboževalci Jinxov bodo jeseni vsekakor prišli na svoj račun .

Set an alarm to go off before the latest time you want to wake up .
Make the alarm really quiet radio or music .
Set a second alarm to go off at the latest time you want to wake up .
This is your regular alarm that will wake you up no matter what .
Waking up abruptly by the sound of an alarm clock is an inherently unnatural thing to do .
Sometimes you can wake up after 8 hours and feel like crap .
Other times , you can wake up after 6 hours and feel completely rested .
The problem lies in what you 're doing when you 're suddenly woken up from your slumber .
I use a very simple , safe , and free ( as in beer ) system that I think works quite well and is more natural than suddenly waking up to a buzzer .
I do n't drink coffee .
I do n't drink soda / pop / cola ( regularly ) .
I do n't need to use any sort of caffeine to stay awake .
I am not a doctor ( yet ) and while I 'm an expert , it 's not in sleep .
What I can say is that this has worked for me for the past 7 years and throughout university .
Sleep is not just a single thing that happens to you at night .
There are 5 stages of sleep and over the course of a night 's sleep , you cycle through these stages , with each sleep cycle taking approximately 90 minutes .
Stages 1 and 2 are considered " light " sleep , while stages 3 and 4 are " deep " sleep .
The 5th stage is REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep , which is when you dream .
When you wake up during " light " sleep , you wake up rested and feeling good .
Conversely , when you wake up during " deep " sleep , you feel groggy and are more tempted to hit the snooze button .
The traditional alarm clock has a set time to wake you up , but you could be in any stage of sleep when that happens .
Nature did not intend for us to wake up during " deep " sleep .
This guy claims to sleep in 90 minute intervals to attempt to wake up during " light " sleep .
The problem with this is that 90 minutes is not a hard cut rule – every person 's sleep cycle is different .
Further , it 's not like a person 's sleep cycle is constant – it varies in length through the night and is affected by things like exercise , alcohol , and drugs .
Even more , there 's no guarantee that you 'll fall asleep right away , so it 's hard to set the alarm to wake you up in multiples of 90 minutes from when you think you 'll fall asleep .
Plus , if you wake up during the middle of the night , that 'll kill this system .
The end result is that you can still be woken up during " deep " sleep .
There are commercial products that attempt to measure your EEG and wake you up during " light " sleep .
One product that I 've seen , SleepSmart , makes you wear a headband or something around your head while you sleep .
SleepTracker is a watch that claims to be able to read your brain 's EEG from your wrist .
The downside of course , is that they 're expensive , you have to wear them ( so they can be lost or fall off at night and of course , you will be laughed at by your friends and loved ones ) , and worst of all , if they measure incorrectly , you can be woken up at the wrong time .
I use a very simple system that can be done by even the most frugal of people .
I can't remember when I first started doing this , but it 's been at least 7 years .
Here 's what you do :
The whole point is that the first alarm should be so quiet that it will only wake you up if you 're in " light " sleep , like a whisper in your ear .
Waking up in " light " sleep should leave you feeling more refreshed than waking up in " deep " sleep .
The second alarm is the back up to make sure that you wake up in time :) .
You can use two alarm clocks to accomplish this .
I personally use a dual alarm clock that lets me do this easily ( I did n't buy the alarm clock to do this , it just so happened that I had this alarm clock when I created this system or the alarm clock led me to create this ) .
My alarm clock lets me set two alarms ; I set the first to use the radio with the volume set low and the second alarm to buzzer .
I have something that looks like this :
You 'll have to adjust two things in this system .
The first is when to set the first alarm .
You can use the 90 minute rule to estimate when you 'll be in " light " sleep and set the alarm accordingly .
Alternatively , you can just set the first alarm 30 , 45 , 60 , or 90 minutes early and hope that you 're in " light " sleep during that time .
The second thing you need to adjust is the alarm itself .
You want it loud enough to wake you up during " light " sleep , but not so that it 'll wake you up during " deep " sleep .
This is an easy to implement system that does n't require you to drastically change your lifestyle , but can improve how you feel when you wake up and throughout the rest of the day .
This is in contrast to some of the more drastic things out there that may actually be harmful to you .
My favourite is what I like to call , the " Wolf Sleep System " .
In his book , " Never Cry Wolf " , Farley Mowat wrote that he was using a strange system that he swore by in which he tried to mimic the sleeping patterns of wolves .
He would sleep for a short period of time , something like 15 minutes , then he would get up and crawl around on all fours in a little circle , and then go back to sleep for 15 min. and repeat .
He claims that he had a girl in his bed once that was not pleased with his sleeping pattern and he gave up the girl rather than his sleeping system .
I tried this system long ago , but did n't make it through the night .
I did it maybe 2 or 3 times , but then I was like , screw this and did n't wake up until morning .
There 's been a lot of buzz recently about polyphasic sleep , where you attempt to sleep less by spreading out sleep throughout the day with short naps .
There have also been some warnings that this may be unhealthy and that it can reduce your ability to stay awake for prolonged periods of time , i.e. you 'll need an emergency nap every couple hours .
I figure that my system can't be worse than just regularly using an alarm clock and does n't require much effort on your part .
It 's worth a shot and if it helps you , more power to you .

GROUP BY
Well , there is one way to write about picking people without offending anyone : if you really say nothing at all .
For example : At NiceCo , we conduct our interviews as conversations .
We discuss each candidate ’s experience and accomplishments , we canvas their views and share our objectives with them , working collaboratively to identify the most appropriate contribution they can make to the team ’s success .
Now see , you ca n’t criticize that because it did n’t actually say anything .
Maybe it ’s a wonderful process involving nice people , or maybe what really happens is that they decide whether to hire you in the first thirty seconds based on some triviality like whether you have body odour .
If you do n’t say anything , there ’s no kibble and no meat .
It ’s an empty dish .
This does not mean it ’s a bad process or a bad statement .
But the process is n’t reproducible from the statement alone .
That ’s the exact sense in which I say that the statement is empty .
This separates the concern of how to generate the list from the concern of how to transform the list .
Someone posted a variation with different conditions : you can simply generate a new transformation function by composing two of the exiting functions with two new functions , more or less .
And if someone asked for the same thing in Ancient Rome , you could write a different generator that generated the numbers from I to C .
Do n’t bother writing to say that my confidence is the reason why : I recall failing a technical interview when I brain cramped and was unable to write a program to print the first 100 prime numbers .
I ’m not that smart .
does much more than write about Infinity , Combinatory Logic , Recursion Theory , and Gödel ’s Incompleteness Theorems .
And he does much more than teach these concepts delightfully by turning them into stories and puzzles to solve .
He also teaches philosophy by way of insightful essays and anecdotes .
I ’m going to paraphrase one of his down - home insights .
This particular little story has helped me through many dark periods in my life .
Raymond was talking about Taoism , and he explained that his two pet dogs embrace the Tao .
I think he described them as “ Sages . ” Raymond explained that like many dogs , they preferred rich chunks of meat and gravy to dried kibble .
And like many people , Raymond had tried making the kibble more palatable by mixing in some meat with the dry dog food and pouring gravy over the whole thing .
The dogs , of course , would carefully pick the meat out and lick up all the gravy , leaving nothing but the dried kibble behind .
But did they resent this ?
Did they howl and whine about the kibble ruining the meat ?
Of course not !
They would wag their tails and frisk about , joyous in finding all that good meat and tasty gravy in their bowls .
It was like the kibble existed in some alternate dimension that the dogs cold not perceive .
Aaah …
Dogs truly are Sages .
Every time someone writes about interviewing and hiring , they are writing about judging people .
That ’s really deep and meaningful to us as people : being picked or not picked , picking or not picking is pretty much all of our social structure .
So when you discuss it , you are reaching deep into people ’s souls .
I know this , because it hurts me when I interview for a job and the response is “ thanks , but no thanks . ”
It hurts when people say , “ you do n’t have the right kind of degree ” or when they tell me that I forgot to usewhen writing a SQL query to sum the sales of automobiles by brand , or that they do n’t think a Black engineer would go over well with Southern clients ( all true stories ) .
There ’s almost no wayto write about picking people without getting some heartfelt “ thank you for recognizing my worth ” responses .
And some invective from people who feel you ’re saying that you would pass them over .
The fact is , there ’s some unpleasant dried dog food in every post about interviews and hiring .
Even if you pick something you think is obvious and unassailable .
Of course , some programmers just eat the delicious meat and ignore the kibble .
Look !
A tasty programming problem !
I ’m one of these .
What was my first thought when I saw a certain notorious screening question ?
I thought , “ Hmmm … Instead of a loop with three conditions , this could be expressed as the composition of three functions , let ’s try writing it that way .
” A tasty chunk of thinking about programming meat !
You know , it never even occurred to me to wonder whether I fail the test and be rejected and be cast out of the herd .
I mean , honestly , was the original author interviewing me for real ?
No !
So why eat the dry dog food ?
Honestly ??
But in even the most trivial problem there ’s some meaty thinking to enjoy .
Composing functions .
Yummy .
Based on responses , the overwhelming majority of readers of this blog are Sages .
Most people respond to a mixture of dried kibble and meaty chunks friskily , wagging their tails and leaping about with programming solutions and discussion about how best to solve the problem .
Yummy stuff indeed .
Some people might wonder if we ’re playing Stairway to Heaven .
Of course if you walk into a music shop and yell “ nobody can play Portrait of Tracy , ” everyone with a bass is going to start hitting harmonics .
That is n’t because we ’re insecure and need to prove ourselves .
It ’s because we love playing and you just named a tune .
What can I say , I ’m delighted with how many people love to play music .
And I ’m delighted with how many programmers love to program .
For its own sake .
So thank you all for reminding me that life is all about the tasty chunks and delicious gravy .
I really appreciate it .
Thank you .
Especial thanks to Tom and Eric for constantly telling us all about the tender and sublime taste of Haskell .
It ’ll be on the menu one of these days .
Wonderful , the universe is covered in gravy !

15 Ways To Resign : How To Walk Off Your Job
This is Part 2 of the series entitled “ A Job Quitter ’s Primer ” .
Find Part 1 of this subject here .
So now that I ’ve discussed both the recommended and the questionable reasons for leaving a job , I ’m following up with how it should be done .
Or not .
How To Quit Your Job
The Good Ways
Resign in person .
Provide both an oral and written resignation .
You should approach things professionally and write a resignation letter incorporating the following information :
Your intention of leaving
The date you are resigning
The date you would like to leave
Sign the letter A basic resignation letter would look as follows ( you can always add a little more personality to it if you prefer ) : Company Address
HR Department Today ’s date Dear Mr Hr Manager , I am writing to inform you of my resignation , from POSITION with COMPANY NAME .
As per my contract , I am providing X weeks notice and my last day will be DATE .
Sincerely , YOUR NAME
Be honest , but be tactful as well .
Even though you may be tempted to lay it down thick , you may want to bite your tongue a little while telling the truth about why you are leaving .
Offer to stay until they find your replacement .
Offer to work on a transition plan with your boss or team to ensure that a proper knowledge transfer is performed , that you ’re able to tie up loose ends , and your work responsibilities are assigned to others .
Evaluate the reasons for your departure so you do n’t turn into a job hopper .
Investing in a little self - reflection may help you determine what keeps you at a particular job , or what keeps you from staying on .
Many companies do frown upon too many employment changes reflected in a resume .
Give sufficient notice .
The standard length of time for staying at your old job after you ’ve officially resigned is 2 weeks .
Do n’t stay longer than that to protect yourself from unexpected changes involving your new company ( such as a hiring freeze or a change in management ) and to avoid possible awkwardness and ill feelings at your old position .
Preserve your bridges .
As they say over here , the Valley is a small place and there ’s some likelihood that you ’ll probably bump into old comrades at some other point in time , at new places of work .
I ’m pretty careful about staying professional and in good terms with everyone I work with no matter what the state of our relationships are , in case I encounter anyone again in the future .
So do n’t burn your bridges .
Be prepared for the consequences .
There ’s a lot to straighten out once you decide upon leaving a job : COBRA , unused vacation time , unemployment benefits , 401K issues .
Also , set up your references for your job hunting efforts , if you do n’t have a new job lined up .
Have another job lined up first .
It ’s best if you can have the new job offer in writing so that you cover all the bases before making any moves .
This way , the ball remains in your court and you have control of your situation .
You can find some other great ways to move on here .
-ooOoo -
The Worst Ways
Try not to leave under these circumstances , if you can help it .
Do n’t quit when your timing is bad .
It ’s common sense : do n’t leave your job if you currently have a lot of financial obligations and you do n’t have something else lined up .
Do n’t quit when you do n’t have negotiating power .
It probably bears repeating : do n’t leave without having another job lined up .
With some negotiating power during your departure , you may be able to work out better terms with your employer or may even consider counter - offers .
Do n’t announce your departure by way of email , fax , phone or post - it note .
This is how to burn your bridges instantly .
Your boss wo n’t appreciate it , and your chances for getting references from your former employer will be nil .
So no matter how you hate it at your job , you still need to be polite about your leaving .
Do n’t leave by making a dramatic exit .
Now this would be lame .
I doubt anyone would like being privy to a drawn out , emotional departure from a co-worker .
It ’s a way to get blacklisted in an industry as a “ challenging employee ” .
Avoid becoming overly emotional .
For the same reason as above , it ’s embarrassing to be less than businesslike in a professional situation .
Here ’s a personal experience that bothered me for quite a while ; I actually still cringe when I recall the incident .
Do n’t leave suddenly and without warning .
Not only is it unprofessional , it is also immature to ditch your job without fair warning .
Again , this is an excellent way to ruin your track record .
A proper resignation should be granted an employer just out of respect and courtesy .
If you go , do n’t take other colleagues and the company ’s clients .
This is simply unethical .
However , it ’s not uncommon in ruthless industries for this to happen .
It may be common enough that such a practice is acceptable in some circles .
I personally have n’t seen this happen in the world I work in …yet .
Just an aside : I would n’t consider the mass exodus by a bunch of disgruntled employees from a particular company as “ taking one ’s colleagues away ” from their place of work since it ’s most likely that everyone ’s decided to up and leave on their own , albeit for similar reasons .
Now this I ’ve seen happen numerous times throughout my work life !
For fun , here are a few more ways to go badly , by CNN Money readers .
-ooOoo -
Remember though , no matter what you decide to do , just remember that it ’s a small world , even in the realm of business , and that it ’s best to go out under the most positive terms you can muster .

For more than a decade , Dick Cheney has tussled with the CIA , first as secretary of Defense and later as vice president .
Now that long and tortured history forms the backdrop of a federal probe into who named an undercover agency officer -- an inquiry that is centering in part on Cheney ’s office .
Special Prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald has interviewed not only the vice president but also his chief of staff , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , and several other current and former Cheney aides as he seeks to learn who told reporters about the agent and whether anyone obstructed his inquiry .
Cheney ’s long relationship with Libby , and their shared doubts about the CIA , help explain why the vice president and his staff would draw the prosecutor ’s interest .
Fitzgerald is in the final stages of deciding whether to issue indictments , according to defense lawyers in the case , and his decision could roil a White House struggling with sinking poll numbers , a troubled Supreme Court nomination and other problems .
Fitzgerald is trying to determine who revealed the identity of Valerie Plame , an undercover officer and the wife of former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson IV .
Wilson had publicly accused the Bush administration of twisting intelligence to rally support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Advertisement
Initially , Fitzgerald was investigating whether Plame was unmasked in an effort to undermine her husband ’s credibility by suggesting that a fact - finding mission he undertook for the CIA was the result of nepotism .
However , the inquiry has broadened to questions of perjury , obstruction of justice and possibly conspiracy to violate laws on classified materials .
Fitzgerald has learned about ongoing tensions between Cheney ’s circle and the CIA .
According to a former White House official interviewed by The Times , Libby and others in the White House were incensed by Wilson ’s public criticism , in part because they saw it as a salvo fired by the CIA at administration officials , including Cheney , who was perhaps the most outspoken advocate of the case against Iraq .
Witnesses have told Fitzgerald about those tensions .
New York Times reporter Judith Miller wrote recently that she told the grand jury that Libby had been angry with the CIA in the months after the invasion of Iraq , saying that President Bush might have made inaccurate statements about Iraqi weapons programs because the agency did not discuss its doubts .
Cheney and Libby have worked together for years .
As secretary of Defense for President George H.W. Bush , Cheney hired Libby in a senior role .
As vice president , Cheney brought Libby on as his top aide and national security advisor .
The two are said to be so close personally and ideologically that some refer to Libby as “ Cheney ’s Cheney . ”
Advertisement
In addition to Cheney and Libby , Fitzgerald has interviewed aides Mary Matalin , John Hannah and Cathie Martin .
Jennifer Millerwise , a former media aide now working as CIA communications director , was questioned two years ago .
The fact that Cheney has only been questioned once could suggest that the prosecutor , though interested in Cheney ’s office , is not focused on the vice president .
Fitzgerald has shown strong interest in senior White House advisor Karl Rove , who has testified to the grand jury four times .
Cheney ’s skepticism of the CIA dates to the late 1980s , when the agency failed to predict the Soviet Union ’s breakup , according to a source familiar with Cheney ’s thinking .
When then - Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990 , and the first Bush administration began to ponder its military options , it became clear to Cheney that the intelligence community had a poor understanding of Iraq ’s arsenal .
Libby , who was working for Cheney , assigned an aide to conduct a secret investigation of Hussein ’s biological warfare capabilities and his likely reactions to a U.S. invasion .
Advertisement
“ Libby ’s basic view of the world is that the CIA has blown it over and over again , ” said the source , who declined to be identified because he had spoken with Libby confidentially .
“ Libby and Cheney were [ angry ] that we had not been prepared for the potential in the first Gulf War . ”
In the view of the officials who went on to form George W. Bush ’s war Cabinet , the CIA continued to blunder through the 1990s .
In 1998 , for example , the CIA failed to anticipate India ’s testing of a nuclear weapon .
After President George W. Bush ’s 2001 inauguration , Cheney immediately established the vice president ’s office as a second base of foreign policy and intelligence inside the White House , in addition to the National Security Council .
Cheney not only received a daily briefing from the CIA , he frequently sat in on the president ’s briefing and the “ principals ’ meetings ” held to assess serious foreign policy and national security issues .
Leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , Cheney worked with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Rumsfeld ’s then - deputy , Paul D. Wolfowitz , to challenge CIA findings that countered their expectations or that disagreed with information they had received through their own intelligence channels .

Cheney traveled from the White House to CIA headquarters in Langley , Va. , a dozen times , most often to discuss Iraq ’s possible links to nuclear weapons and terrorism .
Agency veterans have said that Cheney ’s visits were more frequent than those of any other president or vice president , including the first president Bush , a former director of the agency .
When Cheney visited the CIA , Iraq was his main focus , particularly in the months before the war .
Unlike Libby and others working with the vice president , Cheney was reportedly always polite .
But in his quiet way , he was insistent , sometimes asking the same question again and again as if he hoped the answer would change , according to people familiar with his contacts with the CIA .
Cheney ’s visits perked up agency analysts who often worked anonymously , said one former official .
Many reportedly enjoyed the challenge of a smart questioner and appreciated his interest .
But Cheney ’s visits and his clinging to certain views became noticeable and drew expressions of concern , according to the former official .
For example , CIA officials repeatedly told Cheney and others in his circle that they did not think Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta had met with Iraqi agents in Prague , Czech Republic , before the attacks .
Advertisement
Nonetheless , the agency continued to receive dozens of inquiries on the topic from top officials -- several times from Cheney himself .
Despite the agency warnings , Cheney made reference to the Atta meeting as if it were a sure thing .
“ It ’s been pretty well confirmed that he did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April , several months before the attack , ” Cheney said Dec. 9 , 2001 , on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
The allegation was not backed up with reliable intelligence , as Cheney and his staff had been repeatedly told , according to a former CIA official .
The matter was addressed in public when senators asked CIA Director Porter J. Goss during his confirmation hearings last year to assess the accuracy of Cheney ’s allegations .
“ I do n’t think it was as well - confirmed perhaps as the vice president thought , ” said Goss , a Florida Republican who had been chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .
“ But I do n’t know what was in the vice president ’s mind , and I ’ve certainly never talked with him about this .
So I do n’t know how we came to that conclusion . ”
Advertisement
Asked by Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) whether the assertion was “ worthy of correction , ” Goss said he might have intervened had he been in charge at the time .
“ If I were confronted with that kind of a hypothetical , where I felt that a policymaker was getting beyond what the intelligence said , I think I would advise the person involved , ” Goss said .
Cheney also frequently spoke with certainty throughout 2002 about Iraq and its pursuit of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
Addressing Korean
War veterans in Texas that August , he predicted that Hussein , armed with nuclear weapons , would “ be expected to seek domination of the entire Middle East , to take control of a great portion of the world ’s energy supplies , and to directly threaten America ’s friends throughout the region and subject the United States or any other nation to nuclear blackmail . ”
“ Simply stated , ” Cheney continued , “ there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use them against our friends , against our allies and against us . ”
A presidential commission on intelligence led by senior federal Judge Laurence H. Silberman concluded that questioning of intelligence analysts by outsiders was healthy , and said in March in its final report on the Iraq war that the “ intelligence community did not make or change any analytical judgments in response to political pressure to reach a particular conclusion . ”
Advertisement
Nonetheless , the tensions between the vice president ’s office and the CIA increased as investigators failed to find weapons of mass destruction .
White House staffers feared they would be blamed by the CIA for encouraging misleading intelligence estimates , one former official said .
Then , Wilson ’s account of his CIA mission to Niger embarrassed the White House by undermining the administration ’s claim that Iraq had sought nuclear materials from Africa .
Fitzgerald has been told that Wilson ’s public disclosure of his findings in Niger reminded Libby and other neoconservatives in the White House of their longtime battles with the CIA , according to someone familiar with the case .
And it led some to fear that the agency was trying to shift the blame to the White House for intelligence failures before the war .

First appeared in print in The Rhinoceros Times , Greensboro , NC By Orson Scott Card June 25 , 2006 What Is This " Crime , " Really ?
A fifteen - year - old boy -- let 's call him David -- has been yearning for his driver 's license for a long time .
But today all thoughts of waiting for his license are out the window , because his little sister cut herself and he can't stop the bleeding .
His family 's phone service was cut off long ago .
His parents are n't home .
They live far from any neighbors .
But they do have one uninsured car that David 's been tinkering with .
It runs .
So David puts his sister in the car and , holding a towel on the wound to apply pressure , he drives the car one - handed out onto the road and goes as fast as the car can go , heading for the nearest medical emergency center .
The trouble is , a state trooper sees him driving too fast and pulls him over .
David tries to explain that he 's only driving illegally in order to save his sister 's life , but the trooper does n't listen .
He drags David out of the car and handcuffs him and yells at him that he has no business driving a car without a license , besides which he was speeding and the car is not insured .
" You will never get a license , we will confiscate this illegal car .
Driving is a privilege , not a right , and you have forfeited that privilege by taking it prematurely . "
David can't think about any of this .
So he screams , " My sister is bleeding to death !
Let me get her to the hospital ! "
But it 's as if the trooper is deaf to anything David has to say .
" Do n't scream it me , you miserable pipsqueak !
Until you have a license you do n't even have a right to be heard on these highways ! " * I 'm sick at heart about the number of Americans , including friends of mine who should know better , who are proud of being exactly like that state trooper , when it comes to the question of illegal immigrants .
" They have no right to be here in the first place .
If we give these people amnesty and let them stay and apply for citizenship , we only encourage more illegal immigration in the future .
Besides , they use up our welfare and add to our school costs without paying taxes ! "
In vain do the immigrants try to explain that their families were desperately poor , doomed to continue to live on the edge of starvation , and the only hope was America ... which would n't let them in .
Why can't we look at what these people are actually doing ?
Why can't we see the bleeding child in the passenger seat , and realize that most of these illegal immigrants are doing precisely what you or I would do in the same circumstances ?
No .
All we can think to say is , " You broke the law to get here .
Therefore I do n't have to regard you as a human being or consider what your need was or look at what you have done since you got here .
Since you are here illegally , nothing you do or say makes any difference .
I want you out of here . " *
So what is this vile crime of " illegal immigration " that requires us to throw out hard - working people who do jobs that no American was willing to do ( not at those wages , anyway , not while living in that housing ) ?
It consists of crossing over an arbitrary line that somebody drew in the dirt a century and a half ago .
On one side of the line , poverty , hopelessness , a social system that keeps you living as a peasant , keeps your children uneducated and doomed to the same miserable life you have -- or worse .
On the other side of the line , plenty of jobs that are going begging because nobody who lives on that side is desperate enough to work all day for a wage so low .
But the wage is enormous to you .
It would save your family 's lives , give you hope for your children .
Even if you go there alone and send money home , it would be a blessing .
And if you could get your wife and kids across that line , their lives would be miraculously transformed .
Would n't you take any risk to get across that line ?
* Let 's use another analogy .
There 's just been a disaster .
No aid is getting into your area .
You can't get out .
Your family is desperate for drinking water and something to eat .
The local convenience store has food on its shelves and water in its refrigerator cases .
But the owner stands in the doorway and says , " We 're closed .
We 're closed to anyone but regular customers . "
You try to explain : You 'll pay .
You 'll become a regular customer .
But your family needs water to drink .
" Nope , " he says .
" I know who my regular customers are and you are n't one of them .
Go away . "
But as you leave , you see that his back door is standing open !
Now , you have been taught never to steal .
And you never would steal except ... he 's being completely unreasonable ; he 's letting other people in ; you'd be glad to buy if he'd only let you .
In those circumstances , what would be morally worse :
To sneak in and take the water and a bit of food -- which is stealing -- or to let the family you 're responsible for go without food and water , and quite possibly die ?
Which action is more to be condemned ?
But he 's a looter !
you might explain .
Well , there are looters in such times , and looting is a crime .
But we 're talking about stealing food and water for family members who have no other recourse , not breaking in and taking fancy tv sets .
Is n't there a difference of degree ?
Ca n't we consider mitigating circumstances ?
* We Americans , what exactly did we do to earn our prosperity , our freedom ?
Well , for most of us , what we did was : be born .
Yeah , we work for our living and pay our taxes and all that , but you know what ?
I have n't seen many native - born American citizens who work as hard as the Mexican - born people I see working in minimum - wage jobs in laundries and yard services and intermittent subcontracting projects and other semi-skilled and unskilled positions .
I have no idea which ( if any ) of the people I see doing this work are legals and which are illegals -- but that 's my point .
Latin American immigrants , as a group , are hard - working , family - centered , God-fearing people who contribute mightily to our economy .
* " Yes , but the illegal ones pay no taxes !
They 're freeloading on our system , putting a burden on our schools , " yadda yadda .
And why do I say yadda yadda ?
Because at the wages they 're earning , even if they were citizens they would n't pay income taxes .
We do n't ask people making that little money to pay income tax in this country .
As for the other taxes , they pay them exactly as any other poor people in America pay taxes .
At the store , they pay the same sales tax as the rest of us .
When they buy gas , they pay gas taxes .
When they pay rent to their landlords , some of that goes to paying the property taxes the landlord is required to pay -- just like every other renter .
Most of them are , in fact , paying exactly as much in taxes as they would pay if they were legal immigrants .
* " But they come here and commit crimes and live off of our welfare system ! "
Wait a minute .
Who is " they " ?
All of the illegal immigrants ?
Only a certain percentage of them .
But when we round up illegal immigrants , do we make the slightest effort to distinguish between those who commit crimes here , those who scam the system to get welfare , and those who are working hard and living by all the rules ?
No .
We send them all home .
There is , under present law , no special treatment for illegal immigrants who , during their time in the U.S. , work hard and do n't take anything from anybody without paying for it .
No special consideration for those who live in shockingly desperate poverty here in the United States so they can send most of their pitifully low earnings home to their families in Mexico .
And yet most of the illegal immigrants commit no crimes , but instead live frugally and work hard .
In fact , I dare say that many illegal immigrants work harder and obey our social rules more faithfully than a good many citizens whose right to live within our borders is unquestioned .
And if all you can say to that is , " It does n't matter , send them all home , give them no hope of citizenship because we do n't want to reward people for breaking the law to enter our country , " then here 's my answer to you :
Let 's apply that standard across the board .
No mercy .
No extenuating circumstances .
No sense of punishment that is proportionate to the crime .
Let 's handle traffic court that way .
The penalty for breaking any traffic law , from now on , is : revocation of your license and confiscation of your car .
Period .
DWI ?
Well , we already do that ( though usually for something like the nineteenth offense ) .
But now let 's punish speeders the same way .
Driving 50 in a school zone -- lose your license and your car !
Driving 70 in a 65 zone on the freeway ?
No license , no car .
Not coming to a full stop at an intersection ?
No license , no car .
No mercy , no exceptions , no consideration for the differences between traffic offenders .
Oh , you do n't want to live under those rules ?
Well , you can't deny that people would take the driving laws much more seriously , right ?
" But it would n't be fair ! " you reply .
That 's right .
It would n't be fair .
Yet that 's exactly the same level of fairness that I hear an awful lot of Americans demanding in order to curtail the problem of illegal immigration .
*
And here 's the question that really needs to be asked :
What problem ?
This is n't like drug laws , where despite the claims of some , we know that these illegal drugs are life - wrecking , family - destroying substances that would continue to create an enormous drain on our economy and immeasurable damage to American lives even if we made them all legal .
The only thing that makes illegal immigration a problem is that it 's illegal .
If we simply opened our southern border the way all our borders were open in the 1800s , then would there be any continuing burden ?
Most of these immigrants would still work hard , only now they would have their families with them and the money would not drain away to Mexico .
Those who prospered would pay income taxes .
So economically , there would be an improvement .
Some would freeload off the system ; some would become criminals .
But do we have any evidence that Mexican or Latin American immigrants turn to crime or freeloading in greater numbers than any previous group of immigrants ?
Has n't every immigrant community in our history had its criminal element ?
( Hint :
There is no major immigrant group that has not spawned its criminals .
Irish , Germans , Italians , Chinese , Russian Jews -- no group , with the exception of some groups of religious immigrants , was so righteous that criminals were n't able to operate within their social boundaries in the U.S. )
And yet we would have regarded it as a great injustice to throw out all the immigrants from each of these groups , just because some of them committed crimes .
In this country , we have a long tradition of punishing only the individual who does wrong , not his entire ethnic group .
( Though , come to think of it , there are a lot of people who would like to change that -- but that 's another argument . )
So what , exactly , would be the cost to us of an open - door immigration policy ?
What evidence do we have that the immigrants who would flood across our boundaries would be any worse than the waves of Irish , German , Chinese , Vietnamese , Italian , Russian , Polish , Japanese , or British immigrants ? *
The voice of bigotry speaks : " But they 're dirty , they do n't speak the language , they live in such awful conditions . "
Hey , buddy !
They 're dirty because they 're poor and exhausted and they work with their hands and they sweat from their labor !
They do n't speak the language because they were n't born here and in case you 've never tried it yourself , learning another language is hard .
And they live in awful conditions because they 're doing lousy , low - paying jobs and sending the money home .
How clean , fluent , and well - housed would you be if you moved to Turkey , took the lowest paying jobs in Turkish society , were struggling to learn Turkish during the few moments you were awake and not laboring , and had to support your family back in the home country on whatever you did n't spend to stay alive in Istanbul ?
Of course , these complaints are often disguised ways of saying , " We do n't want them here because they 're brown and most of them look like Indians . "
Only we know better than to admit that 's our motive , even to ourselves .
So we find other words to cover the same territory .
Just remember this .
Each new wave of immigrants from a particular country looked different from those who had come before .
But after two or three generations , with or without intermarriage , we got used to seeing them among us .
Their skin and bone structure and hair type and color became just another way of looking American .
Of course , Mexicans and Indians have been here all along .
If they look strange to you , it 's just because you have n't lived in a part of the country where it is common to see people whose ancestors lived here long before those of European ancestry showed up .
And a lot of those who get mad at seeing " all these illegal immigrants " may not even have seen any .
Because a lot of people in our country who look Mexican or Indian are actually sixth - and seventh - generation Americans whose ancestors were citizens long before yours were .
* " But they displayed the Mexican flag ! "
Yeah , well , that 's because they 're still Mexicans .
If we opened the door to their legal immigration , maybe they 'd become citizens and then they would feel differently about the stars and stripes .
Then again , maybe they 'd continue to be proud of their ethnic heritage and continue to display the Mexican flag from time to time .
Kind of like the wearin ' o' the green , do n't you think ?
*
Here 's a little history .
When the nation of Mexico declared its independence from Spain , it contained within its boundaries the states of California , Nevada , Utah , Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , much of Colorado , and bits of a few other states .
But immigrants from the United States came into Texas and California , not asking permission , not making any effort to become good Mexicans , but instead began to plot to throw the Mexican government out of its own territory and replace it with the government of the United States .
And they succeeded .
Those Americans in Texas revolted against the Mexican government and succeeded in establishing an independent republic that was absolutely ruled by the white immigrant minority , which immediately began to oppress the legal Mexican citizens .
Then the Texans claimed the Rio Grande as their boundary , contrary to the original treaty , and this time when the Mexican government tried to protect its boundaries , the United States weighed in on the side of Texas and when it won the resulting war , it not only established the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas , the U.S. seized all those other states as well !
Oh , yeah , we " paid for them . "
And we did buy that Gadsden Purchase portion of Arizona .
Like they had a choice about selling them to us .
That 's the nightmare story of illegal immigration .
If Americans start moving into your territory , be afraid !
Be very afraid !
By one perfectly rational reading of history , the whole southwestern quarter of the United States actually consists of unjustly conquered territory in which the native inhabitants -- the legal citizens -- were torn apart from their fellow citizens to the south , and our immigration policy consists of denying Mexicans the right to access lands that were historically theirs , and where former Mexican citizens who were involuntarily annexed to the U.S. were long oppressed and discriminated against .
And let 's not even get into the whole issue of Native Americans .
But even with that , take a look at how many of these illegal immigrants are obviously primarily Indian in their ancestry , with almost no hint of any Spanish or European blood of any kind .
And these are the people we say have no right to cross that arbitrary line in the dirt that our forebears put there by brute force ?
There is no historical basis for any American to claim the moral high ground when talking about Mexican immigration to the United States .
Sure , those wars happened long ago .
But how different do you think the history of Mexico might have been if all that Texas oil and all that California gold had stayed within the boundaries of Mexico , as by right they should have ?
So it 's best if we do n't bring morality into the discussion .
We are n't exactly on the squeaky clean side .
*
As for those who get all frantic about how America will become a Spanish - speaking nation , all you 're doing is revealing your complete ignorance of the history of immigration in the United States .
To put it bluntly :
You do n't know what you 're talking about .
All large groups of immigrants from non-English - speaking countries have gone through a period of time -- sometimes many generations -- where large numbers of them lived together and spoke the language of the mother country .
We had many neighborhoods and even towns and cities where the only language spoken was German or Yiddish or Swedish or Chinese .
But these people were n't stupid .
They caught on to the fact that people whose children spoke English without an accent got better jobs , advanced more quickly and rose higher through the educational system , and had a better chance of getting political and economic power .
Mexican immigrants know this .
The overwhelming majority want their kids to be fluent in English .
This is not even a problem .
But in the meantime , which is better , to have public documents printed in the languages people who live here actually speak , or shut out large sections of the populace because we want to punish them for not having been born in America ?
Efforts to " protect English " are the exact equivalent of those signs saying " No Irish Need Apply " or the rules limiting the number of Jews who could be admitted to prestigious universities or the laws telling black people where they could and could not sit in buses and trains .
English does n't need protection .
People need protection from those who would hurt them because they were n't born to English - speaking parents .
* Today , what is President Bush actually proposing ?
Not amnesty -- that would mean declaring all the current illegal immigrants to be legal , no questions asked .
Instead , he 's giving them a way to earn the right to become citizens and become compliant with the law , without having to go back to Mexico first .
So they could keep their jobs , keep supporting their families , continue to contribute to our economy and our tax base as they already do .
Since the only crime most of these people are committing is simply being here without permission , we would give them a reasonable way to get that permission without losing everything else in order to get it .
And then we 'd provide a way for Mexicans to enter our country as guest workers , which would help both Mexico and the United States .
Along with this , as a political sop to those who think that illegal immigration is somehow picking their pockets ( when in fact it 's more likely to be mowing their lawns or harvesting their food ) , he is offering better border enforcement .
Meanwhile , the terrorists who actually threaten this country keep getting in by air or sea or over the Canadian border , and doing it , as often as not , with legal documents .
Ah well .
Just as the " problem " of these " awful immigrants " has always been with us , so also have we always had the grandchildren of immigrants trying to slam the door in the faces of others who want to do nothing worse than become part of our vast American experiment just as our ancestors did .
Why in the world do we regard that as a crime ?

Response from a Reader Hey Scott .
I do n't always completely agree with you , especially politically .
( Of course . )
But I have said everything you said here , except less lyrically .
Did you see the article comparing illegals to home invaders ?
They move into your home without your knowledge or permission , but you have to allow them to stay because they keep the yard nice ?
I was so incensed , I think I made some enemies .
My point was yours .
Who says it 's " your " home ?
So your great great great grandfather fought the Indians for it ?
Okay .
Would it be okay , then , for the Mexican family to just shoot you and your children , and THEN move in ?
Is n't that how the current owner got there ?
I realize you 're not the president and probably can't make anything happen -- but it was still a wonderful thing to read that I am not the only person alive who looks on the border hysteria as medieval racism and the terrorist scare tactics as ridiculously transparent .
I have lived in Southern California and Central Arizona for most of my adult life .
These families are not " low lifes . "
Their kids work as hard as their parents , think nothing of working two or three jobs and saving the entire paycheck from at least one , for long term family goals , regardless of the rigorous self - denial it entails .
The second generation emigres in my kids ' schools were often the class presidents and scholarship recipients -- not because they were genetically superior , but because they were not afraid of hard work , and they had , in many cases , the joyful , affectionate personality that we sometimes associate with Latin people .
I made your argument , that the " crime " is stepping over an imaginary line in the sand .
Everything else is just us , inventing ways to express our prejudice and superiority complex .
As you have pointed out , it is now an embarrasing case of " might makes right . "
What about the golden rule ?
How " right " would it be if Canada became powerful enough to invade us and take all the resources we need to thrive , then tell us we are not allowed to come back without paying their price ?
I 'm no historian , but it probably goes without saying that a lot of Mexicans died trying to defend their property when we invaded their land .
Are we such bullies that we can't imagine how that would feel ?
I completely agree with you that , until our borders are open , we can never consider ourselves enlightened humans .
Where do we get off " owning " a section of the earth ?
Are we really afraid that our economy will fail if we do n't " keep out the riff - raff " ?
And I hope that sounds as offensive to you as it does to me .
I have lived and worked with these folks .
I would be a much finer person if I could adopt their work ethic and their love and loyalty for their families and friends .
Why are we so afraid ?
Projection ?

" Down poured the wine like oil on blazing fire .
And still the riot went on - the debauchery gained its height - glasses were dashed upon the floor by hands that could not carry them to lips , oaths were shouted out by lips which could scarcely form the words to vent them in ; drunken losers cursed and roared ; some mounted on the tables , waving bottles above their heads and bidding defiance to the rest ; some danced , some sang , some tore the cards and raved .
Tumult and frenzy reigned supreme ... "
Nicholas Nickleby , by Charles Dickens , 1839 .
All politicians who seek to justify repressive legislation claim that they are responding to an unprecedented threat to public order .
And all politicians who cite such a threat draft measures in response which can just as easily be used against democratic protest .
No act has been passed over the past 20 years with the aim of preventing antisocial behaviour , disorderly conduct , trespass , harassment and terrorism that has not also been deployed to criminalise a peaceful public engagement in politics .
When Walter Wolfgang was briefly detained by the police after heckling the foreign secretary last week , the public caught a glimpse of something that a few of us have been vainly banging on about for years .
On Friday , six students and graduates of Lancaster University were convicted of aggravated trespass .
Their crime was to have entered a lecture theatre and handed out leaflets to the audience .
Staff at the university were meeting people from BAE Systems , Rolls - Royce , Shell , the Carlyle Group , GlaxoSmithKline , DuPont , Unilever and Diageo , to learn how to " commercialise university research " .
The students were hoping to persuade the researchers not to sell their work .
They were in the theatre for three minutes .
As the judge conceded , they tried neither to intimidate anyone nor to stop the conference from proceeding .
They were prosecuted under the 1994 Criminal Justice Act , passed when Michael Howard was the Conservative home secretary .
But the university was able to use it only because Labour amended the act in 2003 to ensure that it could be applied anywhere , rather than just " in the open air " .
Had Mr Wolfgang said " nonsense " twice during the foreign secretary 's speech , the police could have charged him under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 .
Harassment , the act says , " must involve conduct on at least two occasions ... conduct includes speech " .
Parliament was told that its purpose was to protect women from stalkers , but the first people to be arrested were three peaceful protesters .
Since then it has been used by the arms manufacturer EDO to keep demonstrators away from its factory gates , and by Kent police to arrest a woman who sent an executive at a drugs company two polite emails , begging him not to test his products on animals .
In 2001 the peace campaigners Lindis Percy and Anni Rainbow were prosecuted for causing " harassment , alarm or distress " to American servicemen at the Menwith Hill military intelligence base in Yorkshire , by standing at the gate holding the Stars and Stripes and a placard reading " George W Bush ?
Oh dear ! "
In Hull a protester was arrested under the act for " staring at a building " .
Had Mr Wolfgang said " nonsense " to one of the goons who dragged him out of the conference , he could have been charged under section 125 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 , which came into force in August .
Section 125 added a new definition of harassment to the 1997 act , " a course of conduct ... which involves harassment of two or more persons " .
What this means is that you need only address someone once to be considered to be harassing them , as long as you have also addressed someone else in the same manner .
This provision , in other words , can be used to criminalise any protest anywhere .
But when the bill passed through the Commons and the Lords , no member contested or even noticed it .
Section 125 has n't yet been exercised , but section 132 of the act is already becoming an effective weapon against democracy .
This bans people from demonstrating in an area " designated " by the government .
One of these areas is the square kilometre around parliament .
Since the act came into force , democracy campaigners have been holding a picnic in Parliament Square every Sunday afternoon ( see www1.atwiki.com / picnic / ) .
Seventeen people have been arrested so far .
But the law that has proved most useful to the police is the one under which Mr Wolfgang was held : section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
This allows them to stop and search people without the need to show that they have " reasonable suspicion " that a criminal offence is being committed .
They have used it to put peaceful protesters through hell .
At the beginning of 2003 , demonstrators against the impending war with Iraq set up a peace camp outside the military base at Fairford in Gloucestershire , from which US B52s would launch their bombing raids .
Every day - sometimes several times a day - the protesters were stopped and searched under section 44 .
The police , according to a parliamentary answer , used the act 995 times , though they knew that no one at the camp was a terrorist .
The constant harassment and detention pretty well broke the protesters ' resolve .
Since then the police have used the same section to pin down demonstrators outside the bomb depot at Welford in Berkshire , at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston , at Menwith Hill and at the annual arms fair in London 's Docklands .
The police are also rediscovering the benefits of some of our more venerable instruments .
On September 10 , Keith Richardson , one of the six students convicted of aggravated trespass on Friday , had his stall in Lancaster city centre confiscated under the 1824 Vagrancy Act .
" Every Person wandering abroad and endeavouring by the Exposure of Wounds and Deformities to obtain or gather Alms ... shall be deemed a Rogue and Vagabond ... "
The act was intended to prevent the veterans of the Napoleonic wars from begging , but the police decided that pictures of the wounds on this man 's anti-vivisection leaflets put him on the wrong side of the law .
In two recent cases , protesters have been arrested under the 1361 Justices of the Peace Act .
So much for Mr Blair 's 21st century methods .
What is most remarkable is that until Mr Wolfgang was held , neither parliamentarians nor the press were interested .
The pressure group Liberty , the Green party , a couple of alternative comedians , the Indymedia network and the alternative magazine Schnews have been left to defend our civil liberties almost unassisted .
Even after " Wolfie " was thrown out of the conference , public criticism concentrated on the suppression of dissent within the Labour party , rather than the suppression of dissent throughout the country .
As the parliamentary opposition falls apart , the extra- parliamentary one is being closed down with hardly a rumble of protest from the huffers and puffers who insist that civil liberties are Britain 's gift to the world .
Perhaps they 're afraid they 'll be arrested .

· Britain experienced its hottest July day on record last week and forecasters say more is to come as climate change tightens its grip on the country · Global warming experts claim that by 2050 temperatures will regularly top 40C and warn that our health and infrastructure will be unable to cope
They were the images that finally demonstrated the irreversible climate change now taking hold in Britain .
Where green parklands once provided cool refuges in our cities , newspaper photographs last week showed them to be bleached , white landscapes .
Reservoirs were revealed as cracked , arid deserts .
And from Cornwall , pictures of the nation 's first cage - diving trips for shark - watching tourists , an experience normally confined to Australia 's Great Barrier Reef .
In addition , schools closed , steel railways buckled , and road surfaces melted .
And finally , last Wednesday , the temperature reached 36.3C , the hottest July day on record .
Once more Britain experienced a scorching heatwave , the fifth bout of intense summer heat to have struck the country in 10 years .
And the weather forecaster says there is a lot more to come .
By any account , the searing conditions experienced last week are just a mild foretaste of the severe climate changes that lie ahead .
Even if the world 's carbon dioxide emissions reached the levels sought by the Kyoto protocol , there is nothing that can be done to halt global warming .
As a result , by 2050 , very hot and dry summers will occur once in three years , according to the UK Climate Impacts Programme , while maximum temperatures will top 40C .
By 2080 , south - east England could become on average 5C warmer in summer , making it as hot as Bordeaux today .
The whole of the UK would be affected , although the south - east will bear the brunt , with London taking the worst hit because of ' urban heat - island effect ' .
Climate change will affect how we eat , drink , work , holiday and build our homes and offices .
' We 're going to have to get used to 30 to 40 days a year with temperatures above 25 C , ' said Ian Curtis , leader of the Oxfordshire Climate Exchange Project .
' It 's going to be weird .
In our offices , photocopiers and computers are chucking out heat .
We need to give people a signal of how much energy they 're using , making the electricity meter visible instead of hidden under the stairs . '
Siestas , going home in hot weather , taking longer holidays and working in the cooler north of Britain have all been mooted as possible remedies .
Increases in road rage and violent crime have been identified as dangers .
Global warming is also interfering with the rhythms of British nature .
According to projections obtained by The Observer , wheat production will be down this year by nearly a million tonnes because the severe drought has damaged crops and forced farmers to start harvesting early .
Giampiero Genovese , of the European Commission 's Joint Research Centre , said : ' The wheat - ripening phase has accelerated very fast , which means the grain will be small , and if there is heat stress - 30C for several days - the wheat can even be empty .
The UK is on course for a loss of 5 per cent compared with last year and if , as we predict , there is another heatwave , it may be even worse . '
The British wine industry , however , is revelling in the new climate .
Last week Nyetimber Classic Cuvee 1998 , produced in Sussex , was crowned the best sparkling wine in the world outside the Champagne region of France .
The soil and climate in south - east England are now almost identical to those of Champagne , and tourism leaders believe winery tours could take off .
Last month , in another symbol of Britain going Mediterranean , the country 's first olive grove was planted in Devon , while fields of lavender are becoming a common sight in Sussex .
This could also mean the demise of the English country garden and lawn .
The Royal Horticultural Society warns that daffodils , bluebells , snowdrops , crocuses and tulips will all suffer , as well as birch , willow , ferns and mosses .
Gardeners will find it easier to grow exotic fruits and sub-tropical plants .
The reproductive patterns of pests could change , meaning more flies , rats and mosquitos .
Human health is therefore at risk as well .
The heatwave in 2003 is estimated to have caused around 2,000 extra deaths in England and Wales and 15,000 extra deaths in northern France .
Last week 's heatwave in France is estimated to have killed 21 people , including a 15 - month - old baby .
And then there is the impact of the heat on Britain 's ageing buildings which were never meant to withstand such a climate .
Chris Twin , of engineer Arup and an adviser to the UK Climate Impacts Programme , said : ' As things stand , the majority of buildings will need to be torn down or installed with air conditioning .'
However , the energy consumed by air conditioning could accelerate climate change further .
As Ian Curtis urged , Britain must meet the challenge before it is too late : ' It needs an explosion of creativity across society to deal with these things .
We 're in a tight spot and we need imaginative minds . '
But with temperatures set for the mid-30s again this week , the big heat goes on .
Colonel Curry said it was standard to discipline detainees when they did not follow procedure .
Mr. Ani despaired of ever being released .
His letter that was printed in The Times ended with , “ I hope I can be dust in the storms of Bucca so that I can reach you . ”
Dangers Beyond Jail
“ I did n’t see any kind of solution for me , ” Mr. Ani said after his release .
“ The only solution was to die , ” he said , his eyes welling with tears .
“ I was hoping to die . ”
In releasing Mr. Ani , the American military transferred him to Camp Cropper in Baghdad and gave him $ 25 , which he and his parents used to hire a taxi .
Along the way home , they had to dodge Shiite - controlled checkpoints , and just days later , he said , he narrowly escaped capture by a Shiite militia .
Mr. Ani and other Iraqis say they believe these militias have found a way to learn when Sunni men are released from jail and then hunt and kill them .
Maj . Gen. John D. Gardner , commander of American detainee operations , said that he had heard such concerns and that he was trying to alter the process of releasing detainees to improve their safety .
Mr. Ani said that for him there was only one way to stay alive : flee Iraq .
He said he was scared and puzzled about his next step .
He said he felt that he could not stay in Syria , if only because work was scarce .
But he must compete with other refugees for the attention of another host country .
“ Until now , I ca n’t sleep , really , ” he said .
“ Whenever I hear something noisy I stand up .
I ’m in a very bad psychological situation .
I ca n’t stop thinking of what we should do .
I do n’t have a future here .
How should we live ? ”
When his uncle put on Al Zawra , the satellite television station , Mr. Ani turned to look at the scenes of Sunni children who had been killed and the attacks on American soldiers .
As you ’ll no doubt be aware , the Mono Project is an ambitious , open - source initiative , largely coordinated by Novell .
The aim is to build a complete suite of ECMA - compliant .NET tools ( C# compiler , runtime , class frameworks , etc ) which work across all supported platforms , including Linux , Windows and Mac OS X .
For more background on the project , check out “ Mono ( software ) ” on Wikipedia .
As a keen Mac user , I ’m always looking out for new development tools which not only provide a simple , efficient and intuitive API but also – hopefully – offer cross- platform capabilities too .
From this perspective , Mono would seem to be ideal ; not least , because I ’m a fan of Microsoft ’s .NET class frameworks which do such a great job of taming the atrocious Win32 API beneath !
So , let ’s look further ...
Mono on the Mac …
Getting started with Mono is relatively straightforward ; go to the Mono Project main page , follow the ‘ download now ’ link ( cunningly hidden in the extreme top - right of the screen ) and you ’ll be able to obtain the Mono distribution appropriate to your platform .
For the Mac , this is currently tagged as “ Mono 1.2.3 _1 Framework - Universal ( Stable ) ” .
Once you ’ve downloaded and installed the framework , you ’ll initially find … nothing !
It ’s at this point that Windows users start missing the Start Menu and it ’s highlighted list of freshly installed goodies .
Nothing in the / Applications folder either …hmm … .
Though not blindingly obvious , Mono gets installed as a new framework .
The full path is / Library / Frameworks / Mono. framework .
The various command - line Mono utilities are accessed via aliases which are automatically placed into /usr / bin .
This means that after installing Mono , you can fire up a Terminal window and type ( e.g. ) ‘ mcs ’ .
This will invoke the Mono C# compiler .
Once you ’ve got this far , there ’s a lot you can do , provided you ’re happy to stick with simple text - mode stuff and command line tools .
Naturally , the quintessential C# program has got to be a variant on “ Hello World ” !
using System ; namespace RegDeveloper { class Program { public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " Hello RegDeveloper " ) ; } } }
Type this into a file called hello.cs , compile it with the mcs compiler and – voila !
– you ’ll end up with an executable called hello.exe .
First thing to say is that the file is just as tiny as you ’d expect from Windows development – around 3 K bytes in this particular case .
The reason , of course , is that all the .NET class libraries are located in the aforementioned framework directory .
What ’s perhaps a little more surprising ( at least from the perspective of an OS X purist ) is that .exe suffix on the end of the file .
If you try disassembling the code with any of the usual OS X tools ( e.g. otool ) you ’ll be told in no uncertain terms that hello .
exe is n’t a binary file .
So what ’s going on ?
The key point , if you have n’t twigged , is that the Mono development tools generate executables that are 100 % binary compatible with Microsoft ’s tools running under Windows .
You can take that hello. exe file generated on a Mac , stick it on your PC and run it in the usual way .
What you ca n’t do is run it “ in the usual way ” on your Mac because OS X does n’t understand .exe files !
Note :
If you ’re interested , there ’s a new product out called CrossOver for the Mac here , which is based around Wine .
This makes it possible to run Win32 applications under OS X fairly seamlessly , although I have n’t investigated whether this extends to the execution of Mono executables .
Assuming you ’ve still sitting at the Mac , and you do n’t use CrossOver , you can run hello .
exe by typing the following in a terminal window :
mono hello.exe
In effect , hello.exe gets passed as an argument to the Mono loader which takes care of the program ’s execution .
A bit klunky , but it works .
The accompanying screenshot ( Figure 1 ) shows a partial dump of the various System - prefix assemblies installed by Mono ; obviously , all these goodies are accessible from any command - line tools you build using the C# compiler .
X Marks The Spot …
But what about GUI , I hear you cry ?
After all , System .
Windows .
Forms.dll is rather obviously present in that last screenshot .
It turns out that the news is n’t quite so good here .
The introductory link Mono web info has this to say : “ Mono is primarily developed on Linux , and most of its users are Linux users , so it is the platform best supported ” .
You ’d better believe it ; although support for System .
Windows .
Forms is going great guns on Linux , things are by no means as positive where OS X is concerned .
Yes , you can create graphical applications with forms , dialogs , etc .
But it ’s all based around X11 .
On my machine , I was n’t able to successfully run a Mono GUI application unless I first started the X server running .
This is because Mono ’s System .
Windows .
Forms implementation is built on top of System .
Drawing which , in turn , makes use of X11 .
The net result is that instead of seeing the drop - dead - gorgeous Aqua interface that Mac users take for granted ( Jobs famously said that it was so attractive , you ’d want to lick it ) what you actually get is a kind of retro-looking interface that looks more like Windows 98 than anything else .
If you do n’t start the X11 server before running your Mono app , you ’ll see a whole slew of exception errors .
And if you want to do the whole thing properly , you also need to install GTK which in turn requires ‘ fink ’ which …
Well , you get the idea .
On the positive side , the Mono folks have written a small utility called macpack which packages up a WinForms executable into an application bundle , meaning it can be started from Finder in the usual way .
But that ’s quite a small positive when set against the overarching problem that the current state of Mono uses X11 rather than Core Graphics .
Figure 2 shows a screenshot of MonoDevelop , a C# - based development system which will even run on the Mac , but it knows nowt about Cocoa .
Spot the tell - tale ‘ X ’ icon in the Dock !
There are a number of web sites around which give a somewhat rosier impression of the state of play as far as Mono development on the Mac is concerned .
For example , a recent NewsForge article by Nathan Willis here suggests that Novell ’s iFolder is based entirely around Mono .
Is it ?
Well , uhhh ..no .
I eagerly downloaded iFolder from here , installed it and then sat back to enjoy my first experience of a turnkey Mono application running under OS X .
Needless to say , the user interface looked suspiciously native , and a quick peek inside the application using my favourite spelunking tools revealed that – sure enough – the iFolder front - end is a perfectly conventional Objective - C Mac application written using Cocoa frameworks .
So conventional , in fact , that it has n’t even been converted into a universal binary : it ’s a PPC executable !
All the Mono code resides in the non-GUI back - end .
Note : I should stress there ’s nothing dishonest going on here ; I subsequently discovered that the complete source code to iFolder is readily available from the aforementioned web site , and it bears out my findings .
But , I do take issue with Nathan using iFolder as an example of a “ 100 % . Net application ” .
If it is , then I ’m Lady Godiva .
( Private viewings by appointment only , please … )
Similar considerations apply to Unity , a design tool for 3D game development that runs on both OS X and Windows , available for download here .
Again , we ’re told this is 100 % .NET and again , it is n’t ; it ’s very easy to find the Cocoa classes and .NIB files inside the executable .
The developers themselves make it clear that Mono is used by Unity – but as a scripting language .
If you think about it , this makes perfect sense since , with little effort , game - engine developers get a powerful scripting language which executes at near native speed , thanks to the JIT compiler that forms part of the Mono bag o’tricks .
In fact , the trend seems to be that several games companies are adopting C# through Mono as a scripting language for complex game systems on non-Wintel platforms .
There ’s got to be a joke somewhere in there about “ Mono - gamists ” but as with iFolder , the essential point is that the front - end GUI has nothing to do with Mono .
As a little aside , I recently discovered that some folks are successfully using cross-platform tools to create Mac applications with a near - native look and feel .
As one example , get thee hence to this site , and you ’ll find a cute little application whose main aim in life is to automatically stitch together multiple images so as to create a seamless panorama .
It works well , is fast , and currently supports Windows and OS X. ( A Linux version is planned ) .
Peek under the hood and you ’ll discover a couple of embedded frameworks called QtCore .
framework and QtGui.framework .
Yes , it ’s our old friend Qt , the cross - platform C++ library from Trolltech ( see here , for more on this ) .
So what ’s the bottom line here ?
On the Mac , Mono is ideal if you need a powerful , efficient scripting language or want to create command - line tools that are portable to Linux and Windows .
But if you ’re looking to build great - looking GUI applications which are indistinguishable from native Cocoa apps , then I think we ’ve still got some way to go .
I ’ve heard rumours that a Core Graphics version of System .
Drawing.dll may be in the pipeline , but do n’t hold your breath …
Enter Cocoa#
If that was all there was to say , things might be a bit depressing .
However , let me introduce you to another interesting little open - source project variously called Cocoa# , CocoaSharp or Cocoa - Sharp depending on which Web site you visit .
As the name ( possibly ! ) suggests , Cocoa# is an interface between the world of Mono and C# on the one hand , and Apple ’s Objective - C Cocoa framework on the other .
The idea is that , with Cocoa# , C# developers get access to the rich functionality contained in the Cocoa libraries .
More importantly , it means that Mono applications on the Mac automatically get the native look and feel that Mac users expect .
In effect , Cocoa# is a Mono / C# binding for Cocoa .
You can find more ( but not much more ) here .
This suggests that Cocoa# is included with recent distributions of Mono , which it is – sort of – but the source code is n’t included and the binary is hidden away here :
/ Library / Frameworks /Mono.framework/Versions/1.2.2.1/lib/mono/cocoa-sharp/
In any event , the included binary is old .
A better bet is to go in search of the Cocoa Sharp Wiki – go to here and then click the wiki link in the right - hand corner of the Web page .
This will provide rather more useful information and give you a download link for the version 0.9.1 source code which – again – is old .
I could n’t even get it to compile on my machine .
Fortunately , I was rescued by Todd Schavey , who told me that a more recent version of the source is available via SVN at svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/cocoa-sharp/
[ this is a subversion ( SVN ) URL that you 'll probably only find useful if you have an SVN client installed , which can use it to download the Cocoa Sharp source - Ed ] .
With his help , I was able to successfully build the Cocoa# assembly and even run some of the sample applications that are included .
As far as we can tell , the current version is 0.9.4 .
Figure 3 shows the CocoaDoc sample , written in C# , running on my Intel iMac .
Cocoa# works by exploiting the fact that Cocoa messages are essentially procedural at the level of the runtime library .
In other words , regular messages map to a call to a runtime routine called objc_msgSend , “ super ” messages ( to the immediate ancestor class ) get mapped to a call to objc_msgSendSuper and so on .
In both cases , the first implicit , hidden argument is a reference to ‘ self ’ , just like the C++ or Delphi runtime models .
If you want to see some really hairy C# code , download the Cocoa# sources and take a look inside the src / interop directory .
Guaranteed to make your brain hurt !
Slightly higher up the food - chain , here ’s a little snippet from the SavePanel.cs file , which is part of the glue code providing access to Cocoa ’s NSSavePanel class :
public bool CanSelectHiddenExtension { get { return ( bool ) ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend ( NativeObject , " canSelectHiddenExtension " , typeof ( bool ) ) ; } set { ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend ( NativeObject , " setCanSelectHiddenExtension : " , typeof ( void ) , typeof ( bool ) , value ) ; } }
On the positive side – joy of joys !
– the Cocoa# implementation gives ‘ real ’ properties rather than having to faff around with two distinct accessor methods .
On the negative side , it seems that nobody wants to spend their lives writing reams of glue code like that shown above – activity on this project is currently quite low .
That ’s a real shame since , in my opinion , of the various Mono initiatives around , Cocoa# offers the best hope for coming up with applications that be aesthetically acceptable to the notoriously finicky Mac community !
While pondering all this stuff , I realised that it ought to be possible to come up with a tool for automating the generation of much of this glue code .
There ’s a popular developer ’s utility called class - dump , which is able to peel apart a Cocoa framework or application , showing the names of all the classes contained therein , as well as the signature of each Cocoa message .
I suspect that using something like class - dump , it ought to be possible to take much of the grunt - work out of creating the glue code .
However , when suggesting this recently in the appropriate Apple mailing list , I was told it had been tried before without success .
If at first you do n’t succeed …
Conclusions
Arguably , I ’ve been a bit unfair here .
The real stomping ground of Mono is undoubtedly Linux and – to a lesser extent – the Win32 platform .
That ’s apparently where most of the development effort is being expended these days .
As far as OS X is concerned , I fear that Mono is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
On the one hand , Cocoa - heads see no compelling reason to embrace a new and alien language while Mac purists ( end users , in particular ) will have no interest whatsoever in running strange - looking applications which wo n’t work until they ’ve started the X11 server .
On the other hand , Linux devotees are n’t particularly fond of OS X , partly because it ’s a proprietary closed - source ( in part ) platform .
Furthermore , any efforts expended in terms of building a more feature - complete implementation of Cocoa# would , in a sense , be wasted effort from a portability point of view since Cocoa is obviously only available on the Mac .
What ’s the point in writing your application using an ECMA certified , platform - neutral language when all you ’re doing is making calls to a proprietary , platform - specific toolkit ?
Sounds a bit daft , does n’t it ?
As regards the other issues I ’ve raised , I expect some pundit will be along soon to assure me that if I just added a couple of lines of gobbledegook to this config file , changed a few environment variables here , and altered file permissions there , then it would be possible to get Mono running without X11 .
Great , and when my Auntie can do that blindfolded , Mono will be ready for the masses .
For what it ’s worth , I love both C# and Mono , but in terms of how / where they fit into Mac development , I think it ’s time to step back and re-evaluate where we ’re going .

ML Modules and Haskell Type Classes : A Constructive Comparison
Stefan Wehr and Manuel M.T. Chakravarty
Researchers repeatedly observed that the module system of ML and the type class mechanism of Haskell are related .
So far , this relationship has not been formally investigated .
The work at hand fills this gap by presenting a constructive comparison between ML modules and Haskell type classes ; that is , it introduces two formal translations from modules to type classes and vice versa , which enable a thorough comparison of the two concepts .
And the conclusions ...
In this work , we demonstrated how ML modules can be translated to Haskell type classes , proved that the translation preserves type correctness , and provided an implementation of the translation .
The source language of the translation is a sub-set of Standard ML , the most important feature missing is the ability to define nested structures .
The target language is a subset of Haskell 98 extended with multi-parameter type classes and ( abstract ) associated type synonyms .
Abstract associated type synonyms , another contribution of this work , are used to translate abstract types to Haskell .
Our practical experience suggests that it is feasible to use the general idea behind the translation for practical programming because some of the overhead introduced by the formal translation is avoided when writing the
Haskell code by hand .
Furthermore , we showed that Haskell type classes can be translated into ML modules by using first - class structures as runtime evidence for type class constraints .
We proved that this translation also preserves type correctness and implemented it .
The source language of the translation is a subset of Haskell 98 , which does not support constructor classes , class methods with constraints , and default definitions for methods .
The target language is a subset of Standard ML extended with first - class structures and recursive functors .
It is not recommended writing programs in the style of the translation by hand because too much syntactic overhead is introduced by explicit dictionary abstraction and application .
However , the translation provides a good starting point for integrating type classes into the ML module system .
Finally , we presented a thorough comparison between ML modules and Haskell type classes , which fills a serious gap in the literature because it is the first comparison between the two concepts that is based on formal translations .
The comparison shows that there are also significant differences between modules and type classes .
SYNERGETICS
Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking
by
R. Buckminster Fuller
in collaboration with E. J. Applewhite
Oklahoma City - Gary J. Gorbsky , Ph.D. , a scientist with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation , has found a way to reverse the process of cell division .
The discovery could have important implications for the treatment of cancer , birth defects and numerous other diseases and disorders .
Gorbsky 's findings appear in the April 13 issue of the journal Nature .
" No one has gotten the cell cycle to go backwards before now , " said Gorbsky , who holds the W.H. and Betty Phelps Chair in Developmental Biology at OMRF .
" This shows that certain events in the cell cycle that have long been assumed irreversible may , in fact , be reversible . "
Cell division occurs millions of times each day in the human body and is essential to life itself .
In the lab , Gorbsky and his OMRF colleagues were able to control the protein responsible for the division process , interrupt and reverse the event , sending duplicate chromosomes back to the center of the original cell , an event once thought impossible .
" Our studies indicate that the factors pointing cells toward division can be turned and even reversed , " Gorbsky said .
" If we wait too long , however , it does n't work , so we know that there are multiple regulators in the cell division cycle .
Now we will begin to study the triggers that set these events in motion . "
The findings may prove important to controlling the development and metastasis of certain cancers .
It also holds promise for the prevention and treatment of birth defects and a wide variety of other conditions .
" Dr. Gorbsky 's results provide elegant proof that the cell cycle must be precisely controlled , " said Dr. Rodger McEver , OMRF vice president of research .
" Now he and his lab can work toward developing innovative methods to probe and better understand the complex process of cell division . "
Gorbsky heads the Molecular , Cell and Developmental Biology Research Program at OMRF and holds both an M.A. and a Ph.D. in biology from Princeton University .
He is also adjunct professor of Cell Biology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and a member of the OU Cancer Institute .
His research focuses on mitosis and cytokinesis , the processes involved in cell division , and he has earned international recognition for his work in the area of chromosomal movement and cell cycle control .
###
The current research project , done in collaboration with scientists from the University of Virginia Medical School , was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society .
High - resolution digital images of the cell division process , as well as of Gorbsky , are available upon request .

It is home to Oklahoma 's only member of the National Academy of Sciences .
Only a third of Ohio voters approve of the job Mr. Bush is doing as president or the way he is handling the economy , and they seem poised to take it out on Republican candidates up and down the ballot .
Republican officials at the national level said this week they had all but written off the Ohio Senate and governor ’s races and were diverting resources to other states where they believed they had a better chance of winning .
“ In Ohio we ’ve seen nothing but our manufacturing jobs cease to exist , ” said one poll respondent , David Stuck , 59 , of Miami Township , Ohio , who said he voted twice for Mr. Bush .
He blamed inaction at the federal level for the evaporation of jobs in Ohio and said he planned for vote for the Democratic candidate for United States Senate , Sherrod Brown , over the incumbent , Senator Mike DeWine , a Republican .
“ Call it a protest , ” Mr. Stuck , a Republican , said in a follow - up interview .
“ I have n’t seen anything done in the last six years .
To be honest , I ’m truly thinking about voting Democratic across the board because I ’m tired of Bush . ”
The statewide telephone poll was conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,164 adults , including 1,020 registered voters .
The margin of sampling error for the entire group is plus or minus 3 percentage points , and it is the same for the registered voters .
More than half of the poll ’s respondents said they believed corruption was widespread in Ohio and said , by a 3 - to - 1 margin , that the Republican Party had more corrupt politicians than the Democrats .
Gov. Bob Taft , a Republican , pleaded no contest last year to ethics charges arising from dealings with a crooked investment manager .
Representative Bob Ney , an Ohio Republican , pleaded guilty to corruption charges last week arising from his association with Jack Abramoff , the lobbyist at the center of an influence - selling scandal in Washington .
Doris Stucky , a 79 - year - old retired nurse from New Philadelphia , Ohio , said she thought all politicians were corrupt .
“ I think they ’re out to line their pocketbooks and get votes and they do n’t care what they do or say to get them , ” said Mrs. Stucky , a Republican , in a telephone interview after she participated in the poll .
“ They came down on Bob Ney and I do n’t think he ’s any more guilty than the rest of them , ” she said .
“ It ’s the same in Ohio .
I think politicians are all the same .
I wish we could find some good honest Christian politicians but I do n’t think there are any . ”
Mrs. Stucky said she was undecided about whom she will vote for .
“ If I were writing ‘ The Vital Center ’ today , I would tone down the rhetoric , ” Mr. Schlesinger wrote in his memoir , “ A Life in the 20th Century , ” published in 2000 .
But that rhetoric was attuned to its moment .
( The phrase “ age of anxiety , ” for instance , was the title of an eclogue by W.H. Auden , published in 1947 . )
And the “ hortatory lushness ” Mr. Schlesinger rued in his memoir suited the case he was trying to make for a new political alliance between liberals and conservatives who “ believe deeply in civil liberties , in constitutional processes and in the democratic determination of political and economic policies . ”
Today these seem self - evident virtues , but Mr. Schlesinger was writing in the immediate aftermath of World War II , with its fresh memories of Nazi death camps , its ongoing spectacle of Soviet brutalities and the new threat of nuclear annihilation .
Mr. Schlesinger ’s argument that , amid these perils , democracy could not be passively accepted as a national birthright but must be struggled for reflected the emerging mood of the country .
His work presaged the civil rights protests of the next two decades even as it expressed the national yearning for a new kind of politics divorced from totalizing extremism .
All this would have made for a fine polemic .
But the power of the book radiates from Mr. Schlesinger ’s knowledge of modern history , American and European — in his concise but learned discussions of the Federalists , Whigs and Progressives and also of the roots of Communism and Fascism .
This ability to find latent connections between the present and the past , as well as between American and Continental thinkers , elevated “ The Vital Center ” above the ranks of articulate manifestoes and placed it in the company of other monitory classics written at more or less the same cold war moment , including George Orwell ’s “ 1984 , ” Hannah Arendt ’s “ Origins of Totalitarianism , ” Whittaker Chambers ’s “ Witness ” and Reinhold Niebuhr ’s “ Irony of American History . ”
( I should note here that Mr. Schlesinger favorably reviewed my biography of Chambers in The New York Times Book Review . )
That the phrase “ vital center ” has become a catchword for Democratic Party strategists intent on capturing the mainstream electorate attests to Mr. Schlesinger ’s gift for phrase - making — a gift capitalized on by politicians like Adlai Stevenson , whose campaign he worked on .
But the phrase ’s popularity also suggests that he wrote with an authority not to be found among younger historians and political thinkers , who continue to borrow from their elders .
Peter Beinart , the former editor of The New Republic , has repeatedly invoked the vital center — the term but also the book — in magazine articles and in his own recent book , “ The Good Fight . ”
Indeed , his book is patently an homage to Mr. Schlesinger’s .
For dolphins , sharks , and bony fish moving at their preferred cruising speed , the ratio of tail frequency and amplitude to forward speed is constrained to a narrow but efficient range of values .
This dimensionless ratio is the Strouhal number , and evolution seems to favor efficient swimming motion with a Strouhal number in the range of 0.2 –0.4 .
In the October 16th issue of Nature , Graham K. Taylor et al. show that Strouhal numbers for birds , bats , and insects flying at cruising speed also seem to be constrained to a similar range of values .
1
I was surprised to read that the same range of values applied across creatures of wildly different size , mass , and flight patterns , as well as across species that evolved the ability to fly independently .
In particular , although the authors of the Nature article provide a chart of Strouhal numbers for flapping flight and swimming along with their statistical analysis , I wanted to see what ratios of amplitude , frequency , and speed actually look like in winged flight , what the Strouhal number actually represents , and why it is dimensionless .
The Strouhal number For an animal or insect in flight , the Strouhal number is determined by the frequency ( f ) of wing strokes , multiplied by the amplitude ( A ) of the wing , divided by the animal ’s forward speed ( U ) through the air .
The Strouhal number is equal to f A/U , or : f A
U Before discussing what this ratio represents , let ’s look at each of the three components : frequency , amplitude , and speed .
Frequency
For winged flight , frequency ( f ) is simply the number of wing beats per second .
A complete wing beat has two parts , a downward flapping stroke for power and lift , and an upward stroke for recovery .
For example , when the Common Sheathtail Bat ( Taphozous georgianus ) flies at cruising speed , it beats its wings an average of 8 times each second , with one stroke and one recovery every .125 seconds .
The Zebra Finch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) , cruising at a much higher frequency of 26.9 wing beats per second , beats its wings almost three and a half times within the same amount of time .
Although beats per second is an appropriate unit for measuring winged flight , frequency can also be measured more generally , in Hertz ( Hz ) .
Since 1
Hz = 1 cycle per second , the Common Sheathtail Bat cruises at a frequency of 8 Hz , and the Zebra Finch cruises at 26.9 Hz .
Note that these diagrams assume direct flight with an even , symmetrical stroke and recovery .
In the real world , many animals use an asymmetrical wing beat with a slower downstroke and a faster upstroke , and some smaller birds use intermediate flight patterns that alternate flapping with bounding or gliding motions .
2,3
Amplitude
Also known as wingtip excursion , the amplitude ( A ) of the stroke is the vertical distance traveled by the tip of the wing during the flapping stroke .
Different species use different angles of attack when flying , so a correct display of amplitude must either measure perpendicular to the angle of attack , or normalize the angle by rotating each animal to the vertical .
An animal ’s body also naturally rises or falls with every wing beat , creating an undulating motion that can obscure the actual movement of the wing relative to the body .
To show wing movement accurately , a relative flight line is best , with the animal ’s body maintaining an even height through the entire wing beat .
Assuming a symmetric flight motion , a normalized angle of attack , and a relative flight line , the wing tip descends in a smooth curve through the flapping stroke ( red line ) , and rises through the recovery ( gray line ) , tracing an even waveform .
Amplitude is simply the height of the flight waveform , so the Common Sheathtail Bat cruises with an amplitude of 26 cm , while the Zebra Finch cruises with an amplitude of 12 cm .
Of course in the real world different species use different flapping motions and flight patterns , but simplified waveforms allow for easy comparison .
Geopolitics The Real Unspeakable Truth About Iraq By Ryan McGreal
Published March 08 , 2007
I just read an interesting article in Slate describing what the author calls " the four unspeakable truths " about the Iraq war .
The four truths are :
The war was a mistake ;
The killed and injured soldiers are victims as much as ' heroes ' ; American lives lost in Iraq have been lives wasted ; and The US is losing or has already lost the Iraq war .
In other words , the US is chasing its losses in Iraq .
I 'm tempted to give the article points for trying , but these conclusions were already obvious back in 2003 , well before the war was even a year old .
The fact is that the Iraq war was not a " mistake " no matter how much its rueful former supporters would like .
Buying Enron stock in the first week of November , 2001 - that was a mistake .
Lying to the American people and bullying Congress and the media to invade a country on the false pretext of a nonexistent threat - that was a crime .
Everyone who was actually following events related to Iraq knew that it was effectively disarmed of weapons banned by UN Security Council Resolution 687 by the end of 1998 , as the UNSCOM Director , UNSCOM Chief Inspector , IAEA Director , two UN Humanitarian Coordinators in a row , and the UNMOVIC Director tried to argue , but were ignored and / or ridiculed by the Bush administration and the US newsmedia .
I was able to figure a lot of this out by mid-2002 just from reading publicly available documents in my living room .
I 'm not bragging about this : it did n't take a penetrating insight to read the facts and draw the blindingly obvious conclusions .
The problem in the US is that the policy recommendations that flow from the obvious conclusions are politically unthinkable .
In the US " mainstream " of political discussion ( i.e. the framework established by the two major parties and the mainstream media ) , there are exactly two possible positions on foreign policy : doves and hawks .
The difference between doves and hawks is the difference between containment ( permanent sanctions ) and rollback ( regime change ) .
Try to argue that both positions are wrong and you will be dismissed by both sides as a moonbat .
When partisan conservatives defend the war by saying the US had to do something about Iraq , they 're quite right .
Where they 're wrong is in maintaining the false alternative between doing nothing and invading .
The " mistakes " of the prior administrations were not in failing to invade Iraq ( George H. W. Bush recognized that this would lead to an insoluble quagmire ) but in refusing to lift the UN sanctions at the end of 1998 when Iraq was demonstrably in compliance with UNSCR 687 .
Instead , in keeping with the US government policy that the sanctions would never be lifted as long as Saddam was still in power ( a direct violation of Resolution 687 , by the way , but who 's counting ? ) , the US and UK governments staged a faux crisis involving a regional Ba'ath party office , ordered Richard Butler to withdraw the UN inspectors , and launched three days of illegal missile strikes against Iraq .
After that , recognizing that the inspections program had become a mockery , Saddam refused to allow the inspectors back in ( this was widely and falsely reported as " Saddam kicked the inspectors out " ) and Iraq went into political limbo .
The right thing for the Bush administration to do would have been to seek a Security Council Resolution establishing permanent monitoring of Iraq to ensure ongoing compliance with UNSCR 687 and a lifting of the sanctions that had killed half a million Iraqi children .
Instead , because it was run by a group of neoconservative megalomaniacs who believed they had the power to remake the world like it was a Lego set , the Bush administration capitalized on the FUD that followed 9/11 and fabricated a patently phony " imminent threat " that they used to terrorize , bully , and shame the American public and Congress into supporting their pre-existing plans .
The real unspeakable truth about Iraq is the fact that one country does not have the right to meddle in another country 's affairs in the manner that the US does as a matter of course .

Top 10 Most Eccentric
People you did n't know
Published on 2/7/2006
Matayoshi Mitsuo , the japanese Jesus Christ Matayoshi Mitsuo is an eccentric Japanese politician with the conviction that he is the God and Christ .
According to his program , he will do the Last Judgement as the Christ but the way to do this is totally within the current political system and its legitimacy .
His first step as the Savior is to be appointed the prime minister of Japan .
Then he will reform Japanese society and then the United Nations should offer him the honor of its General Secretary .
Then Matayoshi Jesus will reign over the whole world with two legitimate authorities , not only religious but also political .
He has presented himself in many elections but he has not won yet .
He has become well - known for his eccentric campaigns where he urges opponents to commit suicide by hara - kiri .
Sir Alfred Mehran , the Man who lives at the Airport since 1988 Mehran Karimi Nasseri , also known as Sir , Alfred Mehran ( yes , including the comma ) , is an Iranian refugee who has been living in the departure lounge of Terminal One in Charles de Gaulle Airport since August 8 , 1988 .
After he was later imprisoned , tortured and expelled from his country , he applied for asylum in many European countries without luck .
When he decided to go to the United Kingdom , he claimed that he was mugged , and his shoulder bag stolen while waiting at the RER platform to go to Charles de Gaulle Airport to take a flight to Heathrow .
Nasseri managed to board the plane , but when he arrived at Heathrow without the necessary documentation , Heathrow officials sent him back to Charles de Gaulle .
Nasseri was unable to prove his identity or his refugee status to the French officials and so he was moved to the Zone d'attente ( waiting zone ) , a holding area for travellers without papers .
Nasseri was reportedly the inspiration behind the 2004 movie The Terminal .
Unlike Tom Hanks ' character in the movie , and since at least 1994 , Nasseri does not live in the duty - free transit area but simply in the departure hall , in the circular boutiques and restaurants passage on the lowest floor .
He can at least theoretically leave the terminal at any moment , although , since everyone knows him , his departure might not remain unnoticed .
He does not seem to speak with anyone normally .
With his cart and bags , he almost looks like a traveler , so people either do not notice him or ignore him as if he were a homeless person .
Norton I , Emperor of United States , and Protector of Mexico Joshua Abraham Norton , also known as His Imperial Majesty Emperor Norton I , was a celebrated citizen of San Francisco who proclaimed himself " Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico " in 1859 .
Although he had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him , he was treated deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented .
Norton also corresponded with Queen Victoria , and he was referred to as His Imperial Majesty by local citizens and in the newspaper obituaries announcing his death .
Though he was generally considered insane , or at least highly eccentric , the citizens of San Francisco ( and the world at large ) celebrated his presence , his humor , and his deeds — among the most notorious being his " order " that the U.S. Congress be dissolved by force , and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge to be built across San Francisco Bay .
The King in Mark Twain 's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is reportedly modeled after him .
David Icke , our salvation from Reptilian Humanoids David Icke , is a former professional football player , BBC television sports presenter , and British Green Party national spokesperson .
Since 1990 , he has been what he calls a " full - time investigator into who and what is really controlling the world . " : reptilians .
He dresses only in turquoise and sustains that the world was ruled by a secret group called " The Elite " : a race of reptilian humanoids , known in ancient times as the Babylonian Brotherhood , and that many prominent people are descended from them , including George W. Bush , Queen Elizabeth II , and Kris Kristofferson .
He believes that descendants of the reptiles engage in child molestation and Satanism .
He is the author of 15 books explaining his views .
After a five - hour speech to students , he received a standing ovation at the University of Toronto in 1999 .
Lina Medina , the 5 year - old mother ( youngest ever ) Lina Medina ( born September 27 , 1933 in Paurange , Peru ) gave birth at the age of 5 years , 7 months and 21 days and is the youngest confirmed mother in medical history .
This world record is closely followed by a similar case in Russia .
Lina was brought to a hospital by her parents at the age of 5 years because of increasing abdominal size .
She was originally thought to have had a tumor , but her doctors determined she was in the seventh month of pregnancy .
There was never evidence that Lina Medina 's pregnancy occurred in any but the usual way , but she never revealed the father of the child , nor the circumstances of her impregnation .
She refuses interviews .
Florence Jenkins , the famous Soprano who could n't sing Florence Foster Jenkins ( 1868 ) was an American soprano who became famous for her complete lack of singing ability .
she became tremendously popular in her unconventional way : her audiences apparently loved her for the amusement she provided rather than her musical ability .
Jenkins was firmly convinced of her greatness , comparing herself favourably to the renowned sopranos Frieda Hempel and Luisa Tetrazzini , and dismissed the laughter which often came from the audience during her performances as coming from her rivals consumed by " professional jealousy " .
Jenkins restricted her rare performances to a few favorite venues , and her annual recital at the Ritz - Carlton ballroom in New York City .
Attendance of her recitals was always limited to her loyal clubwomen and a select few others - she handled distribution of the coveted tickets herself .
At the age of 76 , Jenkins finally yielded to public demand and performed at Carnegie Hall on October 25 , 1944 .
So anticipated was the performance that tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance .
Jenkins died a month later .
Pope Michael I , the elected Pope from Kansas since 1990 David Allen Bawden ( born 1959 ) , is an American citizen who was elected " Pope Michael I " by a group of six Conclavist or post - Sedevacantist Catholics , arguing that the elections of the last 6 popes were invalid because they are all modernists .
Sedevacantists argue that if the College of Cardinals will not or cannot elect a valid pope , ordinary Catholics can do so , under the principle of " Epikeia " ( Equity ) .
Acting on the basis of this , David Bawden was elected Pope by six people on 1990 ( including himself and his parents ) .
He is still on the job to this day .
Gilbert Nelles , the reincarnation of Elvis Presley Gilbert Nelles is a man currently resident in the Yukon , who believes that he is the reincarnation of Elvis Presley , resulting from being hit by a beam from a UFO .
He normally chooses to dress in a manner resembling the real - life Elvis Presley , and is a songwriter and artist .
" Tagish " Elvis has performed in Las Vegas with Chubby Checker .
In 2005 , he ran for the leadership of the Yukon Liberal Party , coming in a far distant fourth place with only five votes .
Le Pétomane , the world 's most famous professional farter Le Pétomane was the stage name of the French professional farter and entertainer Joseph Pujol ( 1857 - 1945 ) .
He was famous in Victorian times for his remarkable control of the abdominal muscles , which enabled him to break wind at will .
He derived his stage name from the French verb péter , " to fart . "
Some of the highlights of his stage act involved playing a flute through a rubber tube in his anus and farting sound effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms .
Noel Godin , the cream pie flinger Noel Godin ( 1945 ) is a Belgian writer , critic , actor and notorious cream pie flinger or ‘ entarteur ' .
Godin gained global attention in 1998 when his group ambushed Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in Brussels , pelting the software magnate with pies .
Godin claims his goal has long been to ‘ entarte ' as many people like Gates as possible - people he feels are particularly self - important and lacking a sense of humor .
Godin , who uses the pseudonym ‘ Georges Le Gloupier ' has also inspired an unknown number of followers around the world , who now regularly provide him with details about the whereabouts of various important potential targets .
It took 32 people to conduct the Bill Gates operation .
His followers take care to look as ridiculous as possible as they throw their tarts , smiling broadly , spouting anti-pretentious poetry and repeating " gloup , gloup , gloup . "
So what other eccentric people do you know ?

United 93 .
From DB :
Normally we say that suspense demands an uncertainty about how things will turn out .
Watching Hitchcock ’s Notorious for the first time , you feel suspense at certain points –when the champagne is running out during the cocktail party , or when Devlin escorts the drugged Alicia out of Sebastian ’s house .
That ’s because , we usually say , you do n’t know if the spying couple will succeed in their mission .
But later you watch Notorious a second time .
Strangely , you feel suspense , moment by moment , all over again .
You know perfectly well how things will turn out , so how can there be uncertainty ?
How can you feel suspense on the second , or twenty - second viewing ?
I was reminded of this problem watching United 93 , which presents a slightly different case of the same phenomenon .
Although I was watching it for the first time , I knew the outcomes of the 9/11 events it portrays .
I knew in advance that the passengers were going to struggle with the hijackers and deflect the plane from its target , at the cost of all their lives .
Yet I felt what seemed to me to be authentic suspense at key moments .
It was as if some part of me were hoping against hope , as the saying goes , that disaster might be avoided .
And perhaps the film ’s many admirers will feel something like that suspense on repeated viewings as well .
Psychologist Richard Gerrig in his book Experiencing Narrative Worlds calls this anomalous suspense : feeling suspense when reading or viewing , although you know the outcome .
Anomalous suspense : Some theories
Anomalous suspense has been fairly important in the history of film .
One of the most famous instances in the early years of feature film is the assassination of President Lincoln in Griffith ’s Birth of a Nation ( 1915 ) .
Griffith prolongs the event with crosscutting and detail shots in a way that promotes suspense , even though we know that Booth will murder Lincoln .
Anomalous suspense , of course , is n’t specific to movies ; we can feel this way reading a familiar book or watching a TV docudrama about historical events .
Young children listening to the story of Little Red Riding Hood seem to be no less wrought up on the umpteenth version than on the first .
This is very odd .
How can it happen ?
One answer is simple :
What you ’re feeling in a repeat viewing , or a viewing of dramatized historical events , is n’t suspense at all .
Robert Yanal has explained this position here .
He suggests that you ’re responding to other aspects of the story .
Maybe in rewatching Notorious you ’re enjoying the unfolding romance , and you attribute your interest to suspense .
And there are feelings akin to suspense that do n’t rely on uncertainty –dread , for instance , in facing likely doom .
( This is my example , not Yanal ’s , but I think it ’s plausible . )
Another possibility Yanal floats is that on repeat viewings , you have actually forgotten what happens next , or how the story ends .
Yanal ’s account does n’t fully satisfy me , largely because I think that most people know what suspense feels like and attest to feeling it on repeat viewings .
I did feel some dread in watching United 93 , but I think that was mixed with a genuine feeling of suspense–a momentary , if illogical uncertainty about the future course of events .
In any case , I did n’t forget what happened at the end ; I expected it in quite a self - conscious way .
Richard Gerrig , the psychologist who gave anomalous suspense its name , offers a different solution .
He posits that in general , when we reread a novel or rewatch a film , our cognitive system does n’t apply its prior knowledge of what will happen .
Why ?
Because our minds evolved to deal with the real world , and there you never know exactly what will happen next .
Every situation is unique , and no course of events is literally identical to an earlier one .
“ Our moment - by - moment processes evolved in response to the brute fact of nonrepetition ” ( Experiencing Narrative Worlds , 171 ) .
Somehow , this assumption that every act is unique became our default for understanding events , even fictional ones we ’ve encountered before .
I think that Gerrig leaves this account somewhat vague , and its conception of a “ unique ” event has been criticized by Yanal , in the article above .
But I think that Gerrig ’s invocation of our evolutionary history is relevant , for reasons I ’ll mention shortly .
Suspense as morality , probability , and imagination
The most influential current theory of suspense in narrative is put forth by Noël Carroll .
The original statement of it can be found in “ Toward a Theory of Film Suspense ” in his book Theorizing the Moving Image .
Carroll proposes that suspense depends on our forming tacit questions about the story as it unfolds .
Among other things , we ask how plausible certain outcomes are and how morally worthy they are .
For Carroll , the reader or viewer feels suspense as a result of estimating , more or less intuitively , that the situation presents a morally undesirable outcome that is strongly probable .
When the plot indicates that an evil character will probably fail to achieve his or her end , there is n’t much suspense .
Likewise , when a good character is likely to succeed , there is n’t much suspense .
But we do feel suspense when it seems that an evil character is likely to succeed , or that a good character is likely to fail .
Given the premises of the situation , the likelihood is very great that Alicia and Devlin will be caught by Sebastian and the Nazis , so we feel suspense .
What of anomalous suspense ?
Carroll would seem to have a problem here .
If we know the outcome of a situation because we ’ve seen the movie before , would n’t our assessments of probability shift ?
On the second viewing of Notorious , we can confidently say that Alicia and Devlin ’s stratagems have a 100 % chance of success .
So then we ought not to feel any suspense .
Carroll ’s answer is that we can feel emotions in response to thoughts as well as beliefs .
Standing at a viewing station on a mountaintop , safe behind the railing , I can look down and feel fear .
I do n’t really believe I ’ll fall .
If I did , I would back away fast .
I imagine I ’m going to fall ; perhaps I even picture myself plunging into the void and , a la Björk , slamming against the rocks at the bottom .
Just the thought of it makes my palms clammy on the rail .
Carroll points out that imagining things can arouse intense emotions , and his book The Philosophy of Horror uses this point to explain the appeal of horrific fictions .
The same thing goes , more or less , for suspense .
If the uncertainty at the root of suspense involves beliefs , then there ought to be a problem with repeat viewings .
But if you merely entertain the thought that the story situation is uncertain , then you can feel suspense just as easily as if you entertained the thought that you were falling off the mountain top .
In other words , the relation between morality and probability in a suspenseful situation is offered not to your beliefs but to your imagination .
When you judge that in this story the good is unlikely to be rewarded , you react appropriately –regardless of what you know or believe about what happens next .
Carroll outlines this view in his book Beyond Aesthetics .
How are we encouraged to entertain such thoughts in our imagination ?
Carroll indicates that the film or piece of literature needs to focus our attention on the suspenseful factors at work , thus guiding us to the appropriate thoughts about the situation .
There might , though , be more than attention at work here .
The firewall
In Consciousness and the Computational Mind ( 1987 ) , psychologist Ray Jackendoff asked why music does n’t wear out .
When composers write tricky chord progressions or players execute startling rhythmic changes , why do those surprise or thrill us on rehearing ?
Similarly , you ’ve seen the Müller - Lyer optical illusion many times , and you know that the two horizontal lines are of equal length .
You can measure them .
Yet your eyes tell you that the lines are of different lengths and no knowledge can make you see them any other way .
This illusion , in Jerry Fodor ‘s phrase , is cognitively impenetrable .
We can reexperience familiar music or fall prey to optical illusions because , in essence , our lower - level perceptual activities are modular .
They are fast and split up into many parallel processes working at once .
They ’re also fairly dumb , quite impervious to knowledge .
Jackendoff suggests that our musical perception , like our faculties for language and vision , relies on
a number of autonomous units , each working in its own limited domain , with limited access to memory .
For under this conception , expectation , suspense , satisfaction , and surprise can occur within the processor : in effect , the processor is always hearing the piece for the first time ( 245 ) .
The modularity of “ early vision ” –the earliest stages of visual processing –is exhaustively discussed by Zenon W. Pylyshyn in Seeing and Visualizing : It ’s Not What You Think ( 2006 ) .
As students of cinema , we ’re familiar with the fact that vision can be cognitively impenetrable .
We know that movies consist of single frames , but we ca n’t see them in projection ; we see a moving image .
Early vision works fast and under very basic , hard - wired assumptions about how the world is .
That ’s because our visual system evolved to detect regularities in a certain kind of environment .
That environment did n’t include movies or cunningly designed optical illusions .
So there might be a kind of firewall between parts of our perception and our knowledge or memory about the real world .
Daniel J. Levitin ’s lively book ,
This is Your Brain on Music summarizes the neurological evidence for this firewall in our auditory system .
When we listen to music , a great deal happens at very low levels .
Meter , pitch , timbre , attack , and loudness are detected , dissected , and reconstructed across many brain areas .
The processes runs fast , in parallel , and we have very little voluntary control of them , let alone awareness of them .
Of course higher - level processes , like knowledge about the piece , the composer , or the performer , feed into the whole activity .
But that ’s inevitably running on top of the very fast uptake , disassembly , and reassembly of sensory information .
Go here for more information on the book , including some music videos .
So here ’s my hunch : A great deal of what contributes to suspense in films derives from low - level , modular processes .
They are cognitively impenetrable , and that creates a firewall between them and what we remember from previous viewings .
A suspense film often contains several very gross cues to our perceptual uptake .
We get tension - filled music and ominous sound effects , such as low - bass throbbing .
We get rapid cutting and swift camera movements .
Often the shots are close - ups , as in Notorious ‘s wine - cellar scene and during the characters ’ final descent of the staircase .
Close - ups concentrate our vision on one salient item , creating the attentional focus Carroll emphasizes .
The shots are often cut together so fast that we barely have time to register the information in each one .
This is n’t to say that the action itself has to be fast .
The action in the Hitchcock scenes is n’t rapid , but its stylistic treatment is .
In typical suspense scenes , our “ early vision ” and “ early audition , ” biased toward quick pickup , are given rapid - fire bursts of information while our slower , deliberative processes are put on hold .
This is happening in the Birth of a Nation assassination scene , as well as in the frantic second half of United 93 .
Further , what is shown can push our processing as well .
Seeing people ’s facial expressions touches off empathy and emotional contagion , perhaps through mirror neurons .
This tendency may explain why we can , momentarily , feel a wisp of empathy for unsympathetic characters .
When their expressions show fear , we detect and resonate to that even if we are n’t rooting for them to succeed .
We may also be responding to some very basic scenarios for suspenseful action .
Imagine dangling at a great height ; “ hanging ” is the root of the word suspense .
Or imagine hurtling toward an obstruction , or being stalked by an animal , or being advanced upon by a looming figure .
As prototypes of impending danger , these events may in themselves trigger a minimal feeling of suspense .
And such situations are part of filmic storytelling from its earliest years .
Maybe we ’re predisposed to find facial expressions and dangerous situations salient because of our evolutionary history , or maybe they ’re learned from a very young age .
Either way , such responses do n’t require much deliberate thinking .
They just trigger rapid responses that we can reflect upon later .
Stylistic emphasis and prototype situations surely help the attention - focusing that Carroll discusses .
But I ’m suggesting something stronger :
Many of these cues do n’t merely guide our attention to the critical suspense - creating factors in the scene .
These cues are arresting and arousing in themselves .
They trigger responses that , in the right narrative situation , can generate suspense , regardless of whether we ’ve seen the movie before .
Beyond these cues , of course we have to understand the story to some degree .
Probably some of the aspects of storytelling that Carroll , Gerrig , and others ( including me ) have highlighted come into play .
As Hitchcock famously pointed out , suspense sometimes depends on telling the viewer more than the character knows .
We have to see the bomb under the table that the character does n’t know about .
Suspense is also conjured up by Carroll ’s ratio of morality to probability , our real - world understanding of deadlines , and other higher - order aspects of comprehension .
In addition , our knowledge of how stories are typically told probably shapes our uptake .
We expect suspense to be a part of a film , and so we ’re alert for cues that facilitate it .
Involuntary suspense
So I ’m hypothesizing that part of the suspense we feel in rewatching a film depends on fast , mandatory , data - driven pickup .
That activity responds to the salient information without regard to what we already know .
According to this argument , the sight of Eve Kendall dangling from Mount Rushmore will elicit some degree of suspense no matter how many times you ’ve seen North by Northwest , and that feeling will be amplified by the cutting , the close - ups , the music , and so on .
Your sensory system can’t help but respond , just as it ca n’t help seeing equal - length lines in the pictorial illusion .
For some part of you , every viewing of a movie is the first viewing .
This tendency may hold good for other emotions than suspense .
In the psychological jargon I adopted in Narration in the Fiction Film , experiencing a narrative is likely to be both a bottom - up process and a top - down process .
Suspense and other emotional effects in film may depend not only on conceptual judgments about uncertainty , likelihood , and so on .
They may also depend on quick and dirty processes of perception that do n’t have much access to memory or deliberative thinking .
Film works on our embodied minds , and the “ embodied ” part includes a wondrous number of fast , involuntary brain activities .
This process gives filmmakers enormous power , along with enormous responsibilities .

„ Unser Deal heißt Respekt “
Peter Bucksch , 47 , unterrichtet an einer Berliner Hauptschule , im Problemkiez Neukölln .
Ab nächster Woche ist er dabei im neuen Buck - Film „ Knallhart “ zu sehen .
Wie hart ist sein Alltag wirklich ?
INTERVIEW SUSANNE LANG
taz : Herr Bucksch , im Film sagen Sie einem Schüler , dass Sie an seiner Stelle arbeiten würden , „ sonst – weißt ja , wirste abgeschoben . “
Unterrichten Sie wirklich so ?
Peter Bucksch : Nein , so etwas würde mir nicht über die Lippen kommen .
Gerade bei Migranten muss man im Umgang sehr respektvoll sein .
Was heißt respektvoll ?
Die Schüler ernst nehmen , aber nicht mit Verboten oder Strafen disziplinieren .
Man muss ihnen klare Grenzen aufzeigen .
Sie sind kein Vertreter von Kuschelpädagogik ?
Ich brauche meinen respektvollen Abstand .
Wenn mich jemand anfasst , dann kriegt er zu hören : „ Willste mein Hemd waschen ? “
Und er weiß ganz genau , dass eine Grenze erreicht ist .
Was machen Sie anders , viele Lehrer würden bei so einem Satz nur ausgelacht ?
Als Sportlehrer habe ich einen gewissen Vorsprung .
Die Schüler wissen ganz genau , dass ich konsequent bin .
Wenn ich sage „ Kollege , noch so ein Ding und wir sehen uns in der Klassenkonferenz , dann lerne ich mal deine Eltern kennen , das ist doch auch was Schönes “ , dann ist klar : das ist kein Scherz .
Manchmal scherzen Sie ?
Klar , bis zu einer gewissen Grenze .
Ich bin kein trockener Typ , und wenn ich meinen Job mache , möchte ich auch Spaß dabei haben .
Das dürfen die Schüler auch merken .
Spielt Autorität eine wichtigere Rolle , weil Ihre Schüler oft von einem dominanten Männerbild geprägt sind ?
Das kommt darauf an , welchen Druck die Familie ausübt .
Kolleginnen haben da eher Schwierigkeiten , weil der Respekt vor der weiblichen Person teilweise gar nicht existiert .
Als Mann habe ich da offensichtlich eher gute Karten .
Packen Sie Ihre Jungs auch mal bei der Ehre – sie gilt ja als wichtiger Wert ?
Unser Deal heißt Respekt .
Mit der Ehre , das ist so eine Sache , wenn man sich darauf einlässt , wird es schnell kompliziert .
Thematisieren Sie Werte ?
Ich versuche , den Schülern meine Werte klar zu machen und sie zu vereinbaren mit den ihrigen .
Umgekehrt gilt aber auch :
Wenn ihr streng gläubig seid , kein Problem , aber schränkt mich und andere nicht damit ein .
Haben
Sie viele streng religiöse Schüler ?
Ja , sehr viele .
Oftmals ist es aber auch das Elternhaus , das Religiosität einfordert .
Deshalb sind viele der Schüler Gratwanderer .
Sie treffen in der Schule auf Mädchen mit Kopftüchern genauso wie ohne .
Für viele ist es sehr schwierig , Orientierung für sich selbst zu finden .
Aber an Ihrer Schule funktioniert das Miteinander statt Nebeneinander der Kulturen ?
Sicher , Schule ist da ein interkultureller Freiraum , das unterschätzen viele .
Neben ihr gibt es die Familie oder die Straße , wo wieder ganz andere Regeln gelten .
Hier können sich Schüler ungezwungen bewegen und verabreden , vor allem Mädchen , die sonst zu Hause sitzen müssen .
Die Straße – das heißt im Film „ Knallhart “ Banden , Drogen , Gewalt .
Inwieweit stimmt das mit Ihrem Alltag überein ?
Tja , das ist so , davor können wir die Augen nicht verschließen .
Detlev Buck hat unheimlich gut recherchiert und klasse Momentaufnahmen eingefangen .
Wenn hier ein kleiner Junge aus dem reichen Zehlendorf ankommt , dann kann es passieren , dass er abgezogen wird .
Vielleicht kann der Film Eltern und Außenstehende für die Situation der Jugendlichen sensibilisieren .
Wie reagieren Sie darauf ?
Als Lehrer reagieren wir , wenn wir von solchen Vorfällen hören , und informieren die Polizei oder Behörden .
Und ich muss ehrlich sagen , mit meinen Schülern möchte ich auch nicht tauschen .
Jede Generation hat ihr eigenes Problem , aber auf den Jungen heute lastet schon ein großer Druck .
Was hat sich geändert ?
Es geht dabei los , dass sie bestimmte Klamotten haben müssen , und wenn sie sich die mal angeschafft haben , müssen sie gucken , dass sie sie behalten können .
Haben Sie sich Ihren Beruf eigentlich so vorgestellt ?
Oh nein , er hat sich so entwickelt .
Sie lachen immerhin – sind Sie noch gern Lehrer ?
Naja , die Hauptschule ist ein Ort , an dem man eigentlich klasse arbeiten kann , weil man eine direkte Rückkopplung hat .
Wenn ich schlechte
Laune habe oder keinen so guten Unterricht mache , dann bekomme ich das sofort zu hören : Herr Bucksch , das war jetzt aber doof .
Die Schüler sind auf ihre Art sehr viel ehrlicher .
Aber …?
Ich hätte nicht gedacht , dass ich so viele Dinge zusätzlich regeln muss .
Ein Großteil meiner Arbeit besteht darin , zu gucken , dass die Kids überhaupt zur Schule kommen , was zu Hause mit den Eltern los ist , ob eine Heimeinweisung nötig ist – diese Dinge .
Ist das nicht die Aufgabe des Jugendamtes ?
Eigentlich schon , ja .
Wir müssen das aber initiieren , wir sind die Ersten , die Missstände mitbekommen .
Das ärgert mich ja so an vielen Medienberichten , wo es nur heißt , die Lehrer hätten die Warnsignale nicht gesehen – wenn man sich überlegt , wie vielen Warnsignalen wir nachgehen , das ist enorm !
Mit dem Image der Hauptschulen sieht es auch nicht gut aus .
Klar , wir haben ja auch keine Lobby .
Wir sind das Sammelbecken , da kommen die Reste .
Dabei vergessen die meisten aber , dass sich früher die Hauptschule ausgezeichnet hat mit einer soliden Grundausbildung für einen Arbeiterberuf – diese Arbeiterberufe gibt es aber nicht mehr , die Familientradition von Berufen stirbt , der Sohn hat nicht mehr den Vater als berufliches Vorbild .
Welche Aussichten können Sie da den Schülern bieten ?
Auf keinen Fall die auf Jobs , das ist klar .
Darum geht es an der Hauptschule auch nicht .
Viel wichtiger ist , dass ich dazu beitragen kann , sie zu orientieren und ihre Fähigkeiten zu entwickeln .
Damit sie ihren eigenen
Wert einschätzen können .
Wie erreichen Sie das ?
So schwer ist das gar nicht – wenn man bereit dazu ist , den Unterricht zu ergänzen .
Der Buck - Film zum Beispiel war so ein Projekt .
Einige meiner Schüler haben auch als Statisten mitgemacht .
Dabei machen sie die Erfahrung , dass sie etwas wert sind , und müssen keinen abziehen , weil sie ihren Namen und Ruhm woanders herhaben .
Ein Film wie dieser ist aber eine Ausnahme , oder ?
Naja , wir haben auch dauerhafte Projekte .
Zum Beispiel unsere Schulfirmen im Rahmen der Arbeitslehre , hier gibt es einen Cateringservice , für kleinere Büffets .
Da sehen die Schüler , dass es auch für sie einen Aufgabenbereich gibt .
Sie plädieren für Chancengleichheit ?
Meine Schüler haben nicht die gleichen Chancen , das ist eben so .
Da gab es zu viele Versäumnisse , sprachliche zum Beispiel .
Viele haben sich eine Zwischensprache angeeignet , eine , sagen wir , sehr kreative Form der deutschen Sprache .
Manchmal ist das ja witzig .
Aber wenn sie später beim Bewerbungsgespräch wirklich die gleichen Chancen haben wollen , müssen wir ihnen auch die sprachlichen Mittel zur Verfügung stellen .
Was halten Sie von Deutschpflicht auf Schulhöfen ?
Machen wir uns doch nichts vor : Alles , was mit Zwang passiert , führt nur zu Gegendruck .
Wie sollte ich das überhaupt durchsetzen ?
Hey Jungs , jetzt sprecht bitte Deutsch ?
Besser ist es , die Notwendigkeit mit ihnen zusammen zu erarbeiten .
Fühlen
Sie sich ausgeschlossen , wenn nur Türkisch gesprochen wird ?
Nur bei Elterngesprächen , wenn einige sich plötzlich auf Türkisch unterhalten .
Da denke ich schon , huch , und was mache ich hier ?
Da gehen Sie dazwischen ?
Ja klar , ich spreche kein Türkisch , nur Schimpfworte verstehe ich mittlerweile schon ganz gut .
Wenn man
Ihnen so zuhört , glaubt man gar nicht , dass es überhaupt frustrierte Lehrer gibt …
Aber hallo , ich bin klassisch frustriert !
Ich meckere jeden Tag über Schule und die Schüler .
Wie passt das nun zusammen ?
Wenn ich mich nicht mehr aufregen würde , bräuchte ich nicht mehr unterrichten .
Ich möchte ja gerade , dass der Schulalltag besser wird .
Sie lassen die Arbeit sehr an sich heran ?
Ja , aber das meine ich ja :
Wenn ich mich nicht darauf einlassen würde , dann wäre ich wirklich zu frustriert .
Man darf sich nicht nur am Output orientieren , an der Leistung , die am Ende steht oder nicht steht .
Das neue Berliner Schulgesetz gibt uns – neben den ganzen Reglements – dazu auch Chancen .
Sie meinen , dass Schulen mehr Gestaltungsraum haben ?
Ja , wir können unser eigenes Schulprofil entwickeln .
Dazu braucht man engagierte Kollegen und eine liberale Schulleitung – das haben wir hier .
Trotzdem bedeutet das eine enorme zusätzliche Belastung , die nicht alle Lehrer klasse finden .
Langsam spüre ich die auch .
Leider werden zu wenig junge Lehrer eingestellt .
Das wäre ideal : wir haben die Erfahrung und sie haben die Power .
Demnach könnten wir uns eigentlich die Schulsystem - Debatten sparen ?
Ich bin überhaupt kein Gegner von Einheitsschulen , je mehr Leute mit unterschiedlichen Bildungsniveaus zusammen unterrichtet werden , desto differenzierter kann man sie fördern und desto besser unterstützen sie sich gegenseitig .
Aber solange es die Hauptschule gibt , muss man den Jugendlichen Angebote schaffen , die sie auch nutzen können .
Was war denn Ihr größter Erfolg als Lehrer an dieser Hauptschule ?
Mich freut immer wahnsinnig , wenn ehemalige Schüler vorbeikommen und erzählen , dass es ihnen gut geht .
Einer meiner Schüler hat sogar Zahnmedizin studiert , ein anderer arbeitet an einer Habilitation in Physik !
Kompliment !
Ja , wir haben hier klasse Jugendliche , die es auch wert sind , dass man sich um sie kümmert .
Manche brauchen eben mehr Zeit .
Manchmal hat das auch fast was Trauriges , wenn man so lange mit Leuten gearbeitet hat und muss sie dann wegloben .
Das macht
Sie nicht glücklich ?
Doch , klar !
Wenn ich lange mit Schülern gearbeitet habe , bei denen immer etwas schief gelaufen ist und plötzlich läuft es – da weiß ich wieder , warum ich Lehrer geworden bin .
Greg Wilson asks how computer scientists should distill their knowledge into a one - week course for physical scientists and engineers .
He does n’t propose teaching the theoretical underpinnings of computer science , and I think that ’s wise .
But he goes too far the other way in suggesting a week ’s curriculum that is overly specific about particular tools and helpful hints .
There is a middle ground : professional software developers are beginning to differentiate between the more theoretical study of computer science and the more practical field of software engineering .
It ’s learning about the latter - the principles of constructing good programs and systems - that will do computational scientists the most good in the long run .
Learn to build good software
A generally accepted body of knowledge has begun to emerge in software engineering .
It is not yet as well - defined as the bodies of knowledge that comprise other engineering fields , but it nevertheless contains much that could be useful to a scientist - programmer taking a one - week course in software development .
Software development ?
Perhaps assuming this broad topic as the sole subject of our course alters Wilson ’s premise a little , but for good reason .
While nonprogramming skills such as using LaTex , e-mail , and the Web may be important , people will be able to pick these up on their own or from colleagues .
What they ’ll be less likely to pick up - what a computer scientist can help most with - is a solid grasp of how to produce good programs .
This includes , but goes beyond , programming itself ; thus the software - industry term software development .
In my course we ’ll focus on that subject .
Though he adds these other subjects that I would omit , Wilson does devote a fair portion of the five class days to software development .
From my vantage point as a software engineer , however , even the programming parts of his course focus too heavily on specific programming tools and not enough on underlying software development principles .
His article is titled , “ What Should Computer Scientists Teach to Physical Scientists and Engineers ? ” but a more accurate title would be , “ How to Teach Physical Scientists and Engineers Everything They Always Wanted to Know about Unix but Were Afraid to Ask . ”
It has been my observation that the main reason a Sally Synthesis or a Harold Helmet gets into trouble is not unawareness of Unix commands , Emacs , or Perl , but unawareness of the fundamental principles of software design , programming , quality assurance , and project management .
Non-professional programmers–people who do some programming but whose primary training and expertise lies elsewhere–can usually muddle along quite well on small projects .
They learn enough about tools along the way to get the job done .
What they do not learn along the way is the more abstract , seemingly theoretical knowledge that seems not to produce any immediate payoff , but which is invaluable in the long run .
As Wilson points out , the formal training of most non-professional programmers is limited to two or three terms centered on the use of Fortran .
To someone just learning about computers , Fortran itself can seem plenty daunting .
But on medium and large software projects , language - use details are the smallest of the potential problems .
People who have written a few small programs in college sometimes think that writing large , professional programs is the same kind of work - only on a larger scale .
It is not the same kind of work .
I can build a beautiful doghouse in my backyard in a few hours .
It might even take first prize at the county fair ’s doghouse competition .
But that does not imply that I have the expertise to build a skyscraper .
The skyscraper project requires an entirely more sophisticated kind of expertise .
The difference in complexity between student programs and professional programs can be just as great , and non-professional programmers - underestimate the difference in required expertise at their own peril .
Software development for scientists and engineers :
The one - week course
A week - long software development course should focus , I think , on how to keep medium to large software projects from spinning out of control , how to keep group projects from becoming chaotic , and how to keep long - lived programs from deteriorating to the point of uselessness .
These projects are disasters waiting to happen .
The proper goal of such a course should not be to marginally increase the efficiency of the students , but to provide them with the knowledge of how to avoid catastrophe .
There ’s little to gain from teaching someone how to march toward certain ruin 25 percent faster .
A week - long course can provide more benefit by awakening students to the world of possibilities than by immersing them in the details of a handful of specific tools and methodologies .
Let ’s revise Greg Wilson ’s proposed curriculum accordingly .
Day 1 : Programming practices
Because the students have already been programming , the course begins with the familiar subject area of programming details .
Topics include :
Coding for humans .
This includes a discussion of variable and function naming , layout , and documentation .
It introduces the idea that software development is an exercise in managing complexity .
Control issues .
This segment describes the use of structured control constructs , loop controls , conditionals ( if statements ) , Boolean expressions , and use of the goto statement .
statement .
Integration strategies .
This is an exploration of incremental integration , big - bang integration , and evolutionary - development practices .
Recommended additional sources of information .
Profiling and code - tuning are not discussed .
I think it is not just inappropriate but dangerous to focus on code - tuning in a short , one - week course .
As W.A . Wulf said , “ More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency ( without necessarily achieving it ) than for any other single reason –including blind stupidity . ”
The time is better spent discussing effective design and implementation practices , which produce efficient programs as by - products .
Though I wo n’t mention it again , each day will end with recommended additional sources of information .
Day 2 : Software design
The goal of Day 2 is to provide a few practical design guidelines and to expose the students to the different schools of thought in software design .
Topics this day include
Importance of design .
This segment explains the costs of not doing design and the critical role that design plays in the success of medium and large projects .
It explains the role that good design plays in managing complexity .
Information hiding
Modularity
Overview of structured design
Overview of data - structure design
Overview of object design
Day 3 : Quality assurance
In programming , quality does n’t just happen by itself , even if you ’re being careful .
Topics on Day 3 include
Unit testing
Debugging
Peer reviews
The emphasis of this day is peer reviews –formal or informal reviews of designs , code , and other work products by one ’s colleagues .
Peer reviews are a critical element of success on any project and are one of the few methods that can be implemented in virtually any organization , any scientific discipline , and any hardware and software environment .
The peer - review segment would include some “ peer - review role playing ” so that each person gets at least 15 minutes ’ practice both reviewing and being reviewed .
In addition to their considerable quality - assurance benefit , reviews provide a valuable opportunity for nonprogrammers to exchange information about effective and ineffective programming practices and tools .
Teaching students about reviews sets them up to continue learning about software development from their peers long after the one - week course is over .
Day 4 : Software project management
Day 4 ’s topics deal with how software development complexity is addressed at the project - management level :
Revision management ( including a discussion of make - files and revision - control software )
Waterfall life - cycle model and major alternatives ( spiral model , evolutionary prototyping , etc. )
Software maintenance
Coordination of group projects
Day 5 : Tools and wrap -up
The last day focuses on tools and pulls together the themes outlined in the earlier lectures .
Rather than explaining how to use specific tools , the goal of Day 5 is to identify the kinds of tools that are available .
If people can be shown a tool ’s value , they will seek it out and learn to use it themselves .
Tools have a place on the software engineering menu , but they should be presented as garnishes rather than the main course .
Day 5 will cover the following points :
Overview and demonstration of programming tools .
This can be customized to the specific group and can focus on Unix , Windows , Macintosh , or other environments as appropriate .
Good choices would include code editors , debuggers , database management software , and command - line utilities such as grep .
I agree with Wilson ’s point that the tools selected for discussion should have proved themselves and should not be likely to change in ways that will nullify the students ’ learning .
Overview of scientific tools .
This can also be customized to the particular needs of the students and might include statistical software , specialized word processors , Mathematica , Matlab , modular visualization environments ( MVEs ) , and so on .
Summary of themes running through the whole lecture series .
Immersing physical scientists and engineers for a week in the topic of what it means to build a computer program is where the leverage for lasting improvement lies .
Even the best tools come and go , but a body of long - lasting programming principles has begun to emerge , and knowledge of these principles can greatly benefit the non-professional programmer .
It is easy to write a course outline .
It is another matter entirely to move the content of that outline from the writer ’s pen into the student ’s brain .
The ’ real test of this outline or any other is how it would work in practice - how it would move from thought experiment to curriculum .
Whatever the specifics of the curriculum , Wilson ’s article should be applauded for getting us thinking , and , I hope , doing .
The dispute may come to a head on Friday afternoon when hundreds of Christian teenagers are expected to congregate on the steps of City Hall to pray and “ raise their voices on behalf of their generation , ” organizers said .
A group opposing BattleCry plans to protest alongside .
Opponents have said that the rhetoric used onstage during these events is overtly antigay and subtly militaristic .
Ben Rosen , a San Francisco organizer with World Ca n’t Wait , which is leading the protests , said his group was trying to repudiate what it sees as the deeper goals of BattleCry , including “ imposing their biblical fundamentalist worldview on the country . ”
That said , Mr. Rosen said protesters recognized that they were dealing with a delicate balance of expressing their opinions without appearing to be intolerant themselves .
“ We ’re not out to yell at kids that believe in Jesus ; that ’s awful , ” he said .
“ It would be great , ” he said of BattleCry , “ if it did n’t have this very serious , very pernicious backbone to it . ”
Tasha
White , 18 , attended the event last year and said it had opened her eyes to “ a culture leading us into brokenness . ”
“ You look at Britney Spears , and what she did and that leads to divorce and rehab and drugs , and that ’s a negative influence , ” said Ms. White , who lives in nearby San Bruno and said she had had problems with under - age drinking herself .
“ And that ’s not something I believe our generation should be looking forward to . ”
Ms .
White added that she did not think there was anything antigay about the event , though she believes gay people are “ misguided . ”
I had someone ask for an aisle seats so that his or her hair would n't get messed up by being near the window .
A client called in inquiring about a package to Hawaii .
After going over all the cost info , she asked , " Would it be cheaper to fly to California and then take the train to Hawaii ? "
I got a call from a woman who wanted to go to Capetown .
I started to explain the length of the flight and the passport information when she interrupted me with " I 'm not trying to make you look stupid , but Capetown is in Massachusetts .
" Without trying to make her look like the stupid one , I calmly explained , " Capecod is in Massachusetts , Capetown is in Africa . "
Her response ... click .
A man called , furious about a Florida package we did .
I asked what was wrong with the vacation in Orlando .
He said he was expecting an ocean - view room .
I tried to explain that is not possible , since Orlando is in the middle of the state .
He replied , " Do n't lie to me .
I looked on the map and Florida is a very thin state . "
I got a call from a man who asked , " Is it possible to see England from Canada ? "
I said , " No . "
He said " But they look so close on the map . "
Another man called and asked if he could rent a car in Dallas .
When I pulled up the reservation , I noticed he had a 1 - hour lay over in Dallas .
When I asked him why he wanted to rent a car , he said , " I heard Dallas was a big airport , and I need a car to drive between the gates to save time . "
A nice lady just called .
She needed to know how it was possible that her flight from Detroit left at 8:20 am and got into Chicago at 8:33 am .
I tried to explain that Michigan was an hour ahead of llinois , but she could not understand the concept of time zones .
Finally I told her the plane went very fast , and she bought that !
A woman called and asked , " Do airlines put your physical description on your bag so they know who 's luggage belongs to who ? "
I said , " No , why do you ask ? "
She replied , " Well , when I checked in with the airline , they put a tag on my luggage that said FAT , and I 'm overweight , is there any connection ? "
After putting her on hold for a minute while I " looked into it " ( I was actually laughing ) I came back and explained the city code for Fresno is FAT , and that the airline was just putting a destination tag on her luggage .
I just got off the phone with a man who asked , " How do I know which plane to get on ? "
I asked him what exactly he meant , which he replied , " I was told my flight number is 823 , but none of these darn planes have numbers on them . "
A woman called and said , " I need to fly to Pepsi - cola on one of those computer planes . "
I asked if she meant to fly to Pensacola on a commuter plane .
She said , " Yeah , whatever . "
A businessman called and had a question about the documents he needed in order to fly to China .
After a lengthy discussion about passports , I reminded him he needed a visa .
" Oh no I do n't , I 've been to China many times and never had to have one of those . "
I double checked and sure enough , his stay required a visa .
When I told him this he said , " Look , I 've been to China four times and every time they have accepted my American Express . "
ANN ARBOR — Reading violent scriptures increases aggressive behavior , especially among believers , a new study finds .
The study by University of Michigan social psychologist Brad Bushman and colleagues helps to illuminate one of the ways that violence and behavior are linked .
“ To justify their actions , violent people often claim that God has sanctioned their behavior , ” said Bushman , faculty associate at the U - M Institute for Social Research and lead author of the article published in the March 2007 issue of Psychological Science .
“ Christian extremists , Jewish reactionaries and Islamic fundamentalists all can cite scriptures that seem to encourage or at least support aggression against unbelievers . ”
Bushman , who is also a U - M professor of psychology and communications studies , and colleagues at Brigham Young University and at Vrije University in the Netherlands , found the same relationship in two separate experiments detailed in the article .
The first study involved Brigham Young University students , 99 percent of whom believed in God and in the Bible .
The second study involved Amsterdam students , 50 percent of whom believed in God and 27 percent of whom believed in the Bible .
After reporting their religious affiliations and beliefs , participants read a passage adapted from the King James Bible that described a woman ’s brutal murder and her husband ’s revenge on her attackers .
Half the participants were told that the passage came from the Old Testament , half that it came from an ancient scroll found by archeologists .
Half the participants from each of these groups read a version of the passage that included a sentence in which God commanded his followers to take arms against others .
After reading the passages , participants were paired with confederates of the experimenters for a simple reaction task .
They were told that the winner would be able to “ blast ” the losing partner with noise as loud as 105 decibels , about the level of a fire alarm — a common experimental measure of aggression .
The researchers found that both the religious and secular students were more aggressive , delivering louder blasts of noise to their ostensible partners , when told that the passage they read came from the Bible .
Aggressive responses also increased when participants read that God directly sanctioned violence .
The increased level of aggression was greater among believers than among secularists , however .
“ Our results further confirm previous research showing that exposure to violent media causes people to behave more aggressively if they identify with the violent characters than if they do not , ” Bushman said .
The work also supports the view that exposure to violent scriptures may induce extremists to engage in aggressive actions .
“ It ’s important to note that we obtained evidence supporting this hypothesis in samples of university students who were , in our estimation , not typical of the terrorists who blow up civilians , ” Bushman wrote .
“ Even among our participants who were not religiously devout , exposure to God-sanctioned violence increased subsequent aggression .
That the effect was found in such a sample may attest to the insidious power of exposure to literary scriptural violence . ”
According to Bushman and colleagues , this does not mean that reading the scriptures leads to aggression .
“ Violent stories that teach moral lessons or that are balanced with descriptions of victims ’ suffering or the aggressor ’s remorse can teach important lessons and have legitimate artistic merit .
But taking a single violent episode out of its overall context , as we did in these studies , can produce a significant increase in aggression . ”

Wearing a black See by Chloe minidress and red pumps she was definitely channeling her stylist , Rachel Zoe ’s , other clients .
She also added that she has “ separate outfit[s ] for my day and night games . ”
In other related news , have you noticed the clutches that Mischa Barton and Nicole Ritchie have been carrying at red carpet events ?
Well remember that Rachel Zoe had teamed up with Judith Leiber to design two red carpet - worthy bags ?
They have surfaced nowâ€¦ and naturally cost through the roof with the prices ranging from $ 2,000 to $ 10,000 ( and thatâ€™s in US dollars ) .
The “ Cleopatra ” clutch bag and “ Medusa ” soft hobo bag , will be made from a variety of materials , from alligator to metallic suede â€ “ which also means a myriad of colours .
Each bag will feature customized snake hardware , that the Los Angeles Times says was inspired by an old French doorknocker .
Though it seems to resembles the snake hardware on a Christian Louboutin satin shoe .
Zoe reportedly claimed to have taken her bags out every night at the Cannes Film Festival and sold around 50 .
Well if you ’re clients are sporting them around the world , who would n’t buy one ?
( Ok I would n’t , but hey I ’m not fond of Rachel Zoe and her identically dressed clients ) .
They will be available to us mere mortals online at the Judith Leiber online boutique , as well as in various Juidth Leiber stockists .
With her birthday party to be covered exclusively by Harpers Bazaarâ€ ¦ she is getting a tinsy tiny bit over exposed donâ€™t you think ?
On the 30th anniversary of the first midair bombing of a civilian airliner in the Americas , the plot ’s suspected mastermind is hoping that a U.S. federal judge will soon release him from a Texas jail where he has been held on immigration - related charges for the last year and a half .
In a brief submitted to the judge Thursday evening , the administration of President George W. Bush said it opposed the release of Luis Posada Carriles and argued that granting him freedom on bail may have " serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States . "
But , while referring to Posada as " the admitted mastermind of terrorist plots and attacks , " the administration declined to officially declare him a terrorist under the USA PATRIOT
Act which , unlike the immigration law , gives the government authority to detain him indefinitely .
" If Luis Posada Carriles does not meet the definition of a terrorist , it is hard to think of who would , " observed Peter Kornbluh , director of the Cuba Documentation Project at the independent National Security Archive ( NSA ) .
On Thursday , the NSA released a number of recently declassified government documents that , like others released in recent years by the archive , strongly implicate Posada in the bombing of Cubana Flight 455 shortly after it left Barbados en route to Havana , killing all 73 people aboard .
In its brief , the government indicated that it was still trying to find a country , other than Venezuela and Cuba which have both sought his extradition , that would accept Posada .
In the last 16 months , Canada , Honduras , Costa Rica , Panama , El Salvador , Mexico , and Guatemala have all rejected approaches by U.S. officials , according to court records cited by Kornbluh .
The administration ’s efforts to find a foreign refuge for Posada and its refusal to charge him under the PATRIOT
Act have naturally spurred charges of double standards in light of the priority that it has placed on its " global war on terrorism . "
" It simply indicates that , as far as we ’re concerned , one man ’s terrorist is another man ’s freedom fighter ; it completely undercuts our position against terrorism , " according to Wayne Smith , who served as Washington ’s top envoy in Havana in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
" Bush himself has said numerous times that anyone who shelters a terrorist is a terrorist , " Smith , a Cuba expert with the Center for International Policy here .
" Under that definition , President Bush and members of his administration are terrorists because they are effectively harboring Luis Posada Carriles . "
Now 78 , Posada quietly entered the country in the spring of 2005 , although his presence quickly became known  and celebrated  among anti-Fidel Castro Cuban - Americans in South Florida .
Initially , the administration claimed not to know where he was , a pretense it could not sustain once he formally applied for asylum .
He was immediately arrested on immigration charges and transported to a jail in El Paso , Texas .
The latest twist in Posada ’s case came on Sep. 11  ironically , the fifth anniversary of al - Qaeda ’s terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon  when a Texas magistrate recommended that Posada be released from detention .
In response to a habeas corpus petition filed by Posada ’s lawyers , he argued that there was no legal basis for keeping Posada in jail because the attorney general had " never certified ( Posada ) … as a terrorist or danger to the community " under the PATRIOT Act .
The Justice Department ’s brief , which , for the first time , listed many of the terrorist incidents in which Posada has been implicated over some four decades , is designed to persuade the judge that the petition should be denied .
The judge is expected to rule on the case in the coming days or weeks .
The Cuban - born Posada joined the U.S. military in 1963 and was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which trained him in demolitions .
While working for the CIA , a relationship that lasted at least until 1974 , he participated in numerous attempted or actual bombings of Cuban and Soviet targets in Mexico .
As of the early 1970s , he also worked in Caracas as a senior official of the Venezuelan intelligence agency , DISIP .
According to Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) reports obtained in recent years by the NSA , Posada and Orlando Bosch , another militant anti-Communist Cuban exile , were identified by various credible informants as responsible for the Air Cubana bombing virtually immediately after it had taken place .
Bosch , who currently lives in Miami , was pardoned by former President George H. W. Bush in 1990 despite a recommendation by the U.S. Justice Department that he be deported .
The same FBI sources identified two Venezuelans  both of whom worked for a Caracas security firm set up by Posada in 1974  as having placed the bomb on the doomed plane .
The first telephone call the two men made after the bombing was to the company ’s offices in Caracas , according to four newly declassified sworn affidavits by police officials in Trinidad and Tobago who were the first to interrogate them .
The NSA released the affidavits Thursday , along with three other FBI reports sent to then - Secretary of State Henry Kissinger which placed Posada at meetings in Caracas where the bombing was planned , and another State Department report citing CIA sources that quoted Posada as saying , " We are going to hit a Cuban airplane , " just days before the bombing .
Posada himself was arrested by Venezuelan authorities shortly after the bombing in what one former FBI counterintelligence official described to the New York Times last spring as a " preventative measure  to prevent him from talking or being killed . "
Posada then spent the next eight years in jail , punctuated by two inconclusive trials , before escaping Venezuela in 1985 and making his way to Central America , where he quickly found employment with the " Contra " resupply operation run out of the National Security Council under former President Ronald Reagan until it was exposed in late 1986 , when he went underground again .
In a 1998 Times interview in Central America , Posada admitted to organizing a wave of bombings in Cuba in 1997 that killed an Italian tourist and injured 11 others .
He was arrested in 2000 in Panama for allegedly plotting to kill visiting Cuban President Fidel Castro .
In 2004 , he sentenced to an eight - year prison term by a Panamanian court but was unexpectedly freed by outgoing President Mireya Moscoso , apparently at the behest of Cuban exiles , including several Cuban - American lawmakers from South Florida .
He then made his way to the United States .
Venezuela , whose Supreme Court last year referred to Posada in connection to the Air Cubana bombing as " the author or accomplice of homicide , " submitted its request for extradition immediately after Posada ’s presence in the U.S. became known .
But the administration , whose relations with Caracas have steadily deteriorated since Washington appeared to support a 2002 coup attempt against President Hugo Chávez , has refused to respond to the request .
It has argued that , if extradited to Venezuela , Posada could face torture or be extradited to Cuba .
Under the existing treaty that is in force between the U.S. and Venezuela , Washington has the option of either extraditing him to Caracas or trying him here for the same crimes .
" We have massive evidence against him , " noted Smith .
" If the administration does n’t either extradite him or try him here for terrorism , then , it is not only harboring a terrorist ; it is also violating a treaty . "

You go to the supermarket and stop by some shelves offering French and German wine .
You buy a bottle of French wine .
After going through the checkout you are asked what made you choose that bottle of wine .
You say something like “ It was the right price ” , or “ I liked the label ” .
Did you notice the French music playing as you took it off the shelf ?
You probably did .
Did it affect your choice of wine ?
No , you say , it did n’t .
That ’s funny because on the days we play French music nearly 80 % of people buying wine from those shelves choose French wine , and on the days we play German music the opposite happens
This study was done by Adrian North and colleagues from the University of Leicester [ 1 ] .
They played traditional French ( accordion music ) or traditional German ( a Bierkeller brass band – oompah music ) music at customers and watched the sales of wine from their experimental wine shelves , which contained French and German wine matched for price and flavour .
On French music days 77 % of the wine sold was French , on German music days 73 % was German – in other words , if you took some wine off their shelves you were 3 or 4 times more likely to choose a wine that matched the music than wine that did n’t match the music .
Did people notice the music ?
Probably in a vague sort of way .
But only 1 out of 44 customers who agreed to answer some questions at the checkout spontaneously mentioned it as the reason they bought the wine .
When asked specifically if they thought that the music affected their choice 86 % said that it did n’t .
The behavioural influence of the music was massive , but the customers did n’t notice or believe that it was affecting them .
Similar experiments have shown that classical music can make people buy more expensive wine [ 2 ] , or spend more in restaurants [ 3 ] .
Is this manipulation ?
There ’s no coercion , all the customers are certainly wine buyers who are probably more or less in the mood to buy some wine .
But they have been influenced in what kind of wine they buy and they do n’t know that they have .
What would be the effect , I wonder , of having someone stand by the shelves saying to the customers as they passed “ Why do n’t you buy a French wine today ” ?
My hunch is that you ’d make people think about their decision a lot more – just by trying to persuade them you ’d turn the decision from a low involvement one into a high involvement one .
People would start to discount your suggestion .
But the suggestion made by the music does n’t trigger any kind of monitoring .
Instead , the authors of this study believe , it triggers memories associated with the music – preferences and frames of reference .
Simply put , hearing the French music activates [ 4 ] ideas of ‘ Frenchness ’ – maybe making customers remember how much they like French wine , or how much they enjoyed their last trip to France .
For a decision which people are n’t very involved with , with low costs either way ( both the French and German wines are pretty similar , remember , except for their nationality ) this is enough to swing the choice .
This priming affect is , I believe , one of the major ways advertising works [ 5 ] .
Simply by making it more likely for us to remember certain things , we are more likely to make decisions biased in a certain way .
There ’s no compulsion , nobody has their free - will wrenched from their conscious grip .
There ’s just an environment shaped a certain way to encourage certain ideas .
And how could anything be wrong with that ?

Abandoning Islam for Christianity is such a sensitive issue in Malaysia that many converts find themselves leading a secret , double life .
Malay - Muslims make up 60 % of the country 's population
Maria - not her real name - is a young Malaysian woman who has lived a secret and sometimes fearful life since she converted from Islam to Christianity .
Apostasy , as it is known , has become one of the most controversial issues in Malaysia today .
Maria became a Christian over a decade ago when she was 18 .
She says no - one forced her to convert , that she made the decision after studying different religious texts .
If my family find out I am no longer a Muslim they will completely cut me off
Maria
Listen to the programme
And , even now , the church she attends asked her to sign a declaration stating the church is not responsible for her conversion .
" My church says if the authorities come , they are not going to stand up for me .
I have to stand up for myself , " she said .
Not even Maria 's family know she has converted .
" If my family find out I am no longer a Muslim they will completely cut me off .
That means my name in the family will be erased .
" I could migrate , but the problem is I want to stay in Malaysia , because this is my country .
And I love my family .
I just want to live peacefully . "
Heated debate
Malay - Muslims make up 60 % of Malaysia 's population .
The rest are mostly Christians , Hindus and Buddhists .
But many Malaysian Muslims believe that people like Maria pose a threat to Islam .
And the debate between those who say Maria should have the right to officially convert , and those who are against apostasy has become so heated that the prime minister has asked both sides not to discuss sensitive religious questions in public .
If the authorities find out , I will be in big trouble
Maria
Send us your comments Programme information
She is very aware of the possible consequences of her decision to become a Christian if she is discovered .
" If the authorities find out , I will be in big trouble .
They will create hell between me and my family , and hell in my life so that I will no longer get any privileges or employment . "
Her fears are not unfounded .
Another convert - Lina Joy - has been forced to go into hiding since her case went to court .
And at least one of the lawyers involved in that case has had a death threat against him .
Apostasy order
An apostasy order has to be granted for docmentation to change
That means changing the identity cards that state they are Muslim .
Until now , the state has refused to do this until an apostasy order is granted from the Sharia court .
But both women claim they are no longer Muslim , so why should they go to the Sharia court ?
For Maria there is a lot at stake .
She has a boyfriend who is also a Christian and knows she is too .
The couple want to get married .
But while Maria is still officially a Muslim , the only way they could wed in Malaysia would be if he converted to Islam .
And Maria 's family - unhappy with her choice of partner - are pressuring him to do just that .
Crucial time
Maria is tired of living a double life .
" It 's very frustrating , " she tells us tearfully .
" It means I have to limit my scope with friends .
" I have to be able to completely trust someone before I dare to reveal myself .
" I know some other secret converts , but I never keep in touch with them .
" I can't let my network widen , because you do n't always know who you are dealing with . "
I feel that I am all alone in this struggle
Maria
But the coming months will be crucial for them because a decision is expected in the case of Lina Joy .
The outcome of that case may well determine whether Maria will be able to live the life she dreams of - to be married to her boyfriend and live openly as a Christian .
Right now she can't imagine it .
" I feel that I am all alone in this struggle , " she says , " and I am frightened because I am alone against the odds . "

The programme will be repeated on Monday , 20 November 2006 at 2030 GMT .
Beth Fenimore 's father illustrated Roy Lessin 's 1979 book " Spanking : Why , When , How . " *
As a child , Beth 's family attended the church where Roy Lessin preached .
Her parents and the Lessins socialized with each other and babysat each other 's children .
Beth grew up alongside the Lessin 's two children , Joey and Lydia .
Beth 's parents used Roy Lessin's " godly " methods of corporal punishment under his personal tutelage , and in at least one case , Beth was " spanked " with a switch by Roy Lessin 's wife , Charlene ( " Char " ) Lessin .
In this stunning and courageous letter , Beth confronts the man who taught her parents how to use corporal punishment to extinguish all outward evidence of childish emotions displeasing to the parent , and how to instill instant , unthinking obedience based on fear .
She vividly describes the dark cloud Char and Roy Lessin 's methods cast over her childhood , as well as the long lasting psychological , emotional and medical harm which resulted from Roy Lessin 's so - called " loving correction of the rod . "

September 7 , 2005 Open Letter to Roy Lessin
Author of Spanking : Why , When , How Dear Roy , After 19 years I have found the courage to write you this letter declaring how your choice to teach and write about spanking has affected me .
My purpose in writing you this open letter is to share with you and others that the spanking approach you recommend is harmful .
My parents both know my view on this issue .
I have talked to them , as well , about how their decision to implement your spanking recommendations affected me .
I have a mission .
My mission is to warn new parents who are innocently trying to raise happy , healthy children .
Should just one parent spare their child the kind of pain that I endured at the hands of my parents implementing your spanking recommendations , my pain will have more meaning than it does now .
I want to begin by talking about your spanking approach so that we 'll both be using the same language .
In your book , you describe a process by which a parent performs a spanking on their child .
The first step is to use the right instrument ; if a parent uses their hand , the child might become fearful of the parent 's hand .
The second step is to spank promptly .
The third step is to find a private place in which the parent can conduct the spanking .
The fourth step is for the parent to explain to the child why they are going to be spanked .
The fifth step is to get the child into a good spanking position ( when my parents and other adults — such as your wife , Char — spanked me , the ritual involved removing the child 's clothing ) ; you recommend bending the child over a bed , or bending a smaller child over the parent 's lap .
The sixth step is to hit the child on the buttocks with a stick or other spanking implement .
The seventh step is to continue spanking until the child yields a broken cry , which indicates a broken will .
The eighth step is reconciliation .
You recommend that parents comfort the child until sufficient time has passed , and then ask the child to stop crying .
You recommend that parents spank a child who displays a " wrong attitude " by continuing to cry too long after a spanking .
The language in your book is much more " sugary " than what I 've just written .
But my description does not come close to what it feels like to receive a Roy Lessin spanking .
So I 'll describe what a Roy Lessin spanking is like .
My first spanking was when I was six months old .
My mother spanked me for crying after she put me to bed .
She had to spank me repeatedly to teach me to not cry when she put me down .
I know about this incident because my mother used to tell all new mothers about how young I was when she started spanking me .
My last spanking occurred when I was thirteen years old .
The Roy Lessin spankings that I remember most vividly took place between the ages of three and seven , because I hardly went a few days without a spanking at that time .
I 'd like to share with you , and others , what it was like receiving a Roy Lessin spanking .
The moment I found out I was going to get a Roy Lessin spanking , I felt physically ill .
Because the Roy Lessin spanking is a ritual , the ordeal could take a long time .
( When I refer to a spanking ritual , I 'm referring to the steps you outline in your book . )
This was hard for me because I had a child 's sense of time .
The dread bubbled up and consumed me , and stayed with me until the spanking ritual was over .
My parents usually sent me to a private room , such as my own room , and there I would wait until one of my parents came .
( My dad spanked me the most , so in my illustration let 's assume my father is conducting the Roy Lessin spanking . )
My father would explain the reason for the spanking .
This was an excruciating process because I had to listen while knowing what was coming .
Since I might face back - to - back Roy Lessin spankings , I had to be careful not to be disrespectful in my listening to my father .
I had already developed irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , and would feel my guts cramp up with anxiety during his speech .
Then he would ask me to take off my pants and underwear .
I would feel deeply embarrassed because my father was not supposed to see me naked .
( My family had a high standard for modesty . )
My humiliation and fear would grow immeasurably as I leaned over the bed , my father 's knee , or whatever was around .
My private parts were helplessly exposed as my dad laid his hand on my back .
Trying to pull away and defend myself would only mean that the spanking would be longer , or I 'd get a back - to - back spanking .
The stick , paddle inscribed with scripture verses , or belt would swish violently through the air before slapping painfully on my buttocks or thighs .
I would scream in pain and anguish .
I cannot remember a moment of thinking of resisting , rebelling , or trying to " win " anything , as you recommend parents should watch for as they hit their children .
I just tried to survive the best way I knew how .
The screaming , the hitting , and the pain would continue for unknown amounts of time .
When the gruesome pain ended , I would begin to battle with my emotions and my body .
I knew that crying too much could mean that my father would start a Roy Lessin spanking ritual all over again to correct my " wrong attitude . "
My parents were never concerned about the marks they left on my body .
We never talked about the painful marks on my body , or how clothing , baths , chairs , etc. hurt .
The message was clear : there was no pain .
Pulling up my pants was incredibly painful , and so was sitting on my father 's lap .
Because " there was no pain , " I had to pretend my buttocks and thighs did n't hurt even though they did , while my father would wrap his arms around me and " comfort " me .
I was not like the idealized children you describe in your book , not knowing the difference between the spanking implement and the parent .
My father caused me that pain — not a stick !
My father 's arms scared me , and I feared my father like I 've feared no other man .
His touch repulsed me .
I was the same with my mother .
( To this day , I can not physically tolerate either parent touching me .
I feel physically ill at their touch . )
My father would pray , and I could hardly go along but for fear of yet another Roy Lessin spanking .
After we prayed , it was time for me to be happy .
But my insides would be a mess .
Tears would threaten to come back and cause me more pain and anguish .
I had to pretend that I was n't sad , and that I was n't in pain .
This would be my greatest lesson : to be happy no matter how I felt inside .
It would take me a few back - to - back spankings , but I would learn .
It would be a lesson I 'd learn for life — being falsely happy regardless of how my body felt .
One aspect of receiving a Roy Lessin spanking is the sexual aspect .
It 's taken me years to even begin to allow myself to speak of this aspect .
You see , as a child I had no idea what sex was .
I just had this funny sensation that came and went during the Roy Lessin spanking ritual .
To my great dismay , I learned that sexual stimulation can be cross-wired with the painful ritual of spankings .
This cross-wiring was a real problem for me .
Because I could n't cope with the double message of love and pain , I avoided developing an intimate relationship with a man for a very long time .
It took years for me to find a healthy sexuality outside the memories I have of the Roy Lessin spankings .
I struggled with this double message as a child .
I feel a deep sense of shame as I remember hitting and torturing my dolls and Barbies when no one was around .
I needed some way to express the fear , pain , and sexual confusion I felt inside ; yet my childish mind could n't comprehend the significance of what I was doing .
My parents were your " A " students .
They followed your eight steps occasionally reducing the entire Roy Lessin spanking ritual to a few swats — not very often , though .
My butt and thighs would sting for a long time after a Roy Lessin spanking ritual , so I 'd go into the bathroom and use my mother 's mirror to look at my behind .
I remember seeing red stripes crisscrossing my buttocks and my thighs .
At times , I had old marks underneath the new marks .
My parents conducted several Roy Lessin spanking rituals a day when I was a young child .
I remember a teacher at school asking me one day why I did n't just sit still .
I could n't tell her that it was because the marks on my butt hurt so bad sitting in the little wooden chair .
Now that we 've established what a Roy Lessin spanking is and what it felt like to receive one , let 's move on to wrong attitudes .
I 'd like to begin by telling you a story of what it was like having an adult , in this case your wife , address my " wrong attitude . "
One day my parents were moving .
I was four , and woke up to a house that I no longer recognized .
I asked my mother what was happening .
Whatever answer she gave , I did n't understand .
She sent my brothers and me to your house , where your wife Char was to baby - sit us .
On the way out the door , I saw our small parakeet Chirpy sitting in his cage outside our house near some bushes .
Now , Chirpy was n't supposed to be outside .
A dark feeling of dread came over me .
I was frightened as I walked to the car , looking at Chirpy frantically chirping in his cage next to a stack of boxes .
At some point , at your house , Char put all of us down for a nap .
The confusion and fear filled me , and I wondered if I 'd ever see my home again .
When the room was quiet , my emotions burst out of me .
I cried .
Char came in and told me to stop , and I could n't .
So she performed one of your spanking rituals .
I went back to my napping spot .
I lay there for the remainder of my nap — unable to sleep , afraid to move , filled with emotions of dread and fear so large I thought I 'd explode .
But I had to make Char believe that I was cheerfully obeying her .
I put on whatever face I could to convince her , and pretended to be asleep .
I had to pretend I felt different than I did inside .
There are two points I 'd like to make about bad attitudes .
The first is that , as you can see above , adults do not have " powers " that allow them to read the minds of children .
My parents made this mistake over and over again .
They were n't much better at reading my mind or how I felt than your wife was that day I stayed at your house .
You see , parents make mistakes .
There 's no getting around this .
But when a parent uses a force as violent as a Roy Lessin spanking , mistakes are truly damaging , especially when the spanking ritual involves breaking the child 's will — or breaking any part of a child 's psyche !
The second point about " wrong attitudes " is that you tell parents that their children will be happy with your mode of discipline , or even prefer being spanked .
I want to say that I did n't experience that joy .
I built myself a cheerful , obedient shell .
I lived in that shell , only peeking my head out when I felt safe , for 30 years .
It took me another seven years to actually try taking the cheerful , obedient shell off — only to run back into it when something felt like the " old fears of my childhood . "
I have not been happy living in this shell , constantly pretending to be happy when I felt miserable inside .
When I think of a happy child , I think of a child who feels free to express their ideas , thoughts , and emotions .
I think that a parent 's job is to teach a child how to express their emotions , not hit them with a stick until the child displays the emotion of the parent 's choosing .
You write about parents disciplining children for disobedience .
It seems pretty simple .
The parents set up some rules and the children follow them .
When disobedience is based on a child doing or behaving just as the parent asks , following those rules becomes much harder .
As your teachings played out in my growing - up years , I found that I violated more rules than I could keep track of .
Not only that , one of the rules was to follow through without my mom or dad asking a second time .
So perfection became the rule , and perfection was something I failed at miserably .
Even in the cheerful , obedient shell , I was not completely safe .
The life lesson I took away was that there is no such thing as second chances .
I took this lesson to school , and found that I was afraid to try .
Not that my parents did n't encourage me — it was just that if the encouragement did n't work , which it often did n't , they 'd spank me for getting letters backwards , words wrong on spelling tests , and so forth .
Basically , they spanked me for not trying hard enough .
I have n't even mentioned the hundreds of other issues they spanked me for .
I learned how to live helplessly .
Not only did I face my own internal disappointment at not getting something correct , I faced a Roy Lessin spanking at home when I wore out my encouragement .
I grew up thinking that I was mentally handicapped .
Later , as a grown adult , I found out that I 'm dyslexic — something a Roy Lessin spanking would never cure .
For most of my life , I worried that I 'd remembered all this wrong .
About eleven years ago I called Char and asked her to listen to while I recalled a Roy Lessin spanking for her .
I described to her in as much detail as I could remember the beatings I endured again and again .
Char told me that my memories were exactly what you and she had taught my parents .
I had not remembered wrong !
I read your book a few weeks ago .
I was again surprised to realize I knew and remembered your teachings very well .
After the years of growing up around your family and hearing you preach at Outreach , your book brought back your painful teachings and the painful memories I 've been trying so hard to live with .
I kept wanting to grab my cheerful , obedient shell because to this day I feel scared when I think of all the Roy Lessin spankings and teachings .
Both Char , during my call with her , and you , in your first book , talk about spankings having a higher purpose in saving the soul .
You reference Proverbs 20:30 : " Blows that wound cleanse away evil ; strokes make clean the innermost parts . "
Those " blows " left horrible marks on my body that made sitting difficult and bathing with soap sting horribly , and they terrified my spirit .
Feeling terrified is n't the only outcome I live with .
Ten years ago a gastroenterologist diagnosed me with IBS , a condition I 've had since I was around three years old .
Because of the fierce anxiety I felt because of the Roy Lessin spankings , I had terrible chronic stomachaches and diarrhea while I was growing up and as an adult .
Five years ago my psychiatrist diagnosed me with post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and I began to work through my deeply rooted fears of my parents and the Roy Lessin spankings .
Later a physician associate ( PA ) diagnosed me with asthma and severe allergies from a poor immune system , a result of my chronic anxiety .
The same PA told me that I 'm at high risk for colon cancer because of the years of IBS as a result of my anxiety .
Roy , these problems are all due to my parents implementing your teachings using Roy Lessin spankings to correct a multitude of childhood blunders and attitudes .
I can't imagine why a parent would want these outcomes for their child .
I may have looked happy and acted lovingly towards my parents , but I was emotionally and physically sick inside !
Your teachings gave me no option but to live a horrible lie of looking happy when I was miserable .
For almost every day of my life , I fear people .
If people like my parents , and friends of my family such as you and Char , would hurt me this badly , what horrible things would others do to me ?
I was supposed to be safe with my family and friends growing up !
I especially fear men in authority roles .
I occasionally look even at people I know , and who I know to be safe , with terror just because they 've spoken in a tone that reminds me of those early times .
I fear making mistakes .
I choose not to have children of my own because a child 's screams scramble my insides .
Remember all those sermons at Outreach that you , Don Leetch , Dean Kerns , and a few others delivered ?
I still hear children screaming as their parents spanked them outside the church sanctuary during Sunday morning service during those sermons .
I remember the screams of my siblings .
I remember on a Friday night , someone was preaching and a dad took a baby outside for a spanking , and a neighbor called the police .
We stopped the church service , and you went out with your bible to explain to the officer why it was fine for the parent to spank their baby .
All of us inside prayed that the officer would understand and not take the baby away .
As a grown woman I still fear Roy Lessin spankings .
I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night begging my husband to " not let them get me . "
My father and I have talked several times about Roy Lessin spankings .
He has asked for forgiveness , and is horrified by what he has done .
These conversations have been incredibly painful for both of us , and I 'm now 37 years old !
I believe that he thought he was doing the right thing .
You were a leader in the church he believed in , and you were his friend .
Our families socialized together .
This was not some teaching he picked up somewhere , and then went off to make the best of it .
I hope that by this point you begin to see how your simple , sweet words about raising children are actually harmful .
Perhaps you 're wondering if I want to have a dialogue with you , and talk about what you really meant by your early book .
Perhaps you 've adopted a policy of grace , and now recommend that parents spank less and not on bare skin ?
The truth is , I do n't want to know .
If I needed justification or reasoning for your teachings , I could use your book as a reference .
What I 'd like you to do is reconsider your position after carefully looking at how your teachings affected me .
Would a loving parent really want to raise a child to fear people , to wear a cheerful and obedient shell , or to live with PTSD and other ailments ?
I hope the answer you come to is No .
I hope that you realize that hitting a child for any reason is not loving .
Then , I hope , you join the cause to end corporal punishment in the homes of children .
I came into this world a happy , healthy baby .
For no other reason than the Roy Lessin spankings , I now fight for my physical and mental health .
Please help others and me so this does n't happen to any more children .
Help end corporal punishment .
Help end child abuse .
If Jesus said , " Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea " ( Mark 9:42 ) , I can't image that God would condone such behavior in people who claim to be loving parents .
Sincerely ,
Bethany A. Fenimore Beth :
As a kid , I was on the watch for the moods and emotions of others .
I was usually distracted with anxiety wondering if I had done anything wrong that would cause me to get a Roy Lessin spanking .
. .
I remember knowing my mother was watching me and telling me to smile for the photographer .
I felt intimidated by my mother to smile .
No matter what facial expression I had , my eyes seemed to show my anxiety .
Looking at this photo now , I feel deeply sad .
September 2001
If you want to defend against hijackings , the problem you 're trying to solve is one that programmers know well : the buffer overflow attack .
In a buffer overflow attack , someone gives a program much more data than it was expecting .
The data is too long for the memory allocated for it and overflows into the memory occupied by the program itself .
Suddenly the computer is running the attacker 's code .
In a hijacking , the same thing happens to a plane .
A plane has two separate spaces , one for the people carried on it , and one for the people who control it .
A hijacking happens when passengers overflow into the cockpit from the cabin .
What was cargo is now in control .
By promoting themselves from data to code , hijackers on September 11th promoted box -cutters into 400,000 lb. incendiary bombs .
How do programmers solve the problem ?
There are two defenses , one that works and one that does n't .
The defense that does n't work is to check the data on the way in , to make sure it is n't longer than the memory set aside for it .
The problem here is that you might forget to check , or do it incorrectly .
And in fact this happens all the time .
Everyone has known about buffer overflow for at least 15 years , and still software gets written that is vulnerable to it .
The defense that does work is to keep code and data in separate places .
Then there is no way to compromise code by playing tricks with data .
Garbage - collected languages like Perl and Lisp do this , and as a result are immune from buffer overflow attacks .
To programmers , at least , this would suggest that the most reliable way to prevent hijackings is to separate the cockpit from the cabin .
You still need to watch who gets on the plane , to prevent people from simply blowing it up .
But as long as you keep passengers out of the cockpit you can prevent anyone taking control of the plane .
It might be enough just to keep the cockpit door locked , and make it strong enough that to get through it you 'd need something harder to smuggle onboard a plane than a box -cutter .
I 'm sure the government is working on the problem .
I just hope they understand as well as we do that it is never enough just to check what comes in .
After the thinkpad exploded
22nd September 2006 .
This used to be Alan 's laptop , an IBM Thinkpad 600 with third - party batteries we bought separately : ie possibly not IBM's .
Last night it exploded .
Alan was on the other side of the room from the laptop .
I was elsewhere .
He yelled out , I ambled towards the room in my own good time , and then I heard Fire !
Real fire !
Call the fire brigade , now ! and I speeded up a bit .
From Alan subsequently , I gather there was an explosion and flying pieces of laptop , and a fireball , and a couple of fires started where ( presumably ) boiling battery landed , and one fragment smashed an LCD monitor .
And then there was smoke and smell ( there is still smell ) and smoke alarm wailing and firemen and sirens and paramedics ( happily unneeded ) and police and a man with a notebook asking questions for the fire report .
And now there is black dust everywhere in the room and a stench in the house but remarkably little damage .
To my disgust , even Alan 's model railway is intact , although the platforms look like they have been covered in coal ( hah ) .
Because the fragments went everywhere , we have an entertaining session of " check all the wires " ahead of us now .
One more thing .
Smoke alarms are a really good idea .
Ours went off within minutes .
I do n't know whether this is true for all of the UK , but in Wales the fire service will come round and check your house and and give you smoke alarms for free and tell you useful things you might need to know .
I am very glad they did .
To answer the collective inquiries and observations of IRC and phonecalls : no , it does not look likely that the data is recoverable ; yes , there was a backup ; I do n't know how much work was lost ; we are fine ( Alan has some very minor burns from flying laptop shrapnel and has lost a bit of hair , but no more than you would get from playing with a soldering iron ) ; no , as I am not a geek , it never occurred to me to stop and take photos of the exploding laptop -- I left the house like the nice 999 person told me to -- but the pictures on the exploding laptop website give you a very good idea of what happened ; Conrad , I 'm sorry I did n't ring back last night : I meant to , but as you see , I was distracted !
And contrary to all expectations ( diolch , Gareth .. ) , it was n't mine , I was nowhere near it , and this one was absolutely nothing to do with me .
Quick update from Alan : Insurance people are being good , although the first question asked was a slightly incredulous ' Did anyone else see this ' .
Ebay from where I bought the battery have n't replied to the information I sent them .
Kudos to IBM - having phoned them to report it they are actively investigating even though we are not yet sure if the battery is genuine IBM .
The remaining bits of the label I dug out of the remains seem to indicate it may be .
I also took the other two unexploded battery cells out of it and put them outside .
One of the two owls .
Picture by Martin Scott , RSPB Scotland
However , the birds were thought to be male which threatens to dash initial hopes they might be a breeding pair .
They have been seen at Galson near Barvas Moor on the Isle of Lewis on the Western Isles .
RSPB Scotland said the last snowy owls to breed in the UK was a pair on Shetland in 1975 .
Single birds have been seen in Scotland since then , but this was the first pair to be spotted .
' Cruel irony '
Martin Scott , RSPB Scotland 's conservation officer on the Western Isles , said it was a " cruel irony " that the birds appear to be males .
He added : " Although we can't be certain , it could be the case that both of these birds have arrived from North America , probably due to huge recent snow falls that may have prevented them being able to find enough suitable prey species . "
RSPB Scotland said that in their traditional habitat snowy owls feed on lemmings , but switch to catching rabbits when they arrive in Britain .
The law was challenged by civil rights groups and websites
The law made it illegal for websites to provide children access to " harmful " material , but it was never enforced .
Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia said other means of protection , such as software filters , were more effective .
Opponents criticised the ruling , saying parents should not have to shoulder the burden of restricting adult material .
' Unconstitutional '
Judge Reed said that while he sympathised with the need to protect minors , the 1998 Child Online Protection Act was problematic .
It is not reasonable for the government to expect all parents to shoulder the burden to cut off every possible source of adult content for their children
Peter D Keisler
Government lawyer
Send us your comments
" I may not turn a blind eye to the law ... to protect this nation 's youth by upholding a flawed statute , especially when a more effective and less restrictive alternative is readily available , " he wrote .
The act was challenged by civil liberties groups and sexual health and other websites , including the online magazine salon.com , which claimed it was too restrictive and unconstitutional .
The legislation would have fined commercial websites up to $ 50,000 ( £ 25,500 ; 37,500 euros ) and sentenced offenders to up to six months in prison .
" This law is not really aimed at commercial pornography , but really reaches far beyond that to a broad range of valuable content , " John Morris , of the Center for Democracy and Technology , told reporters .
But government lawyers criticised the outcome , saying software filters were not so effective .
" It is not reasonable for the government to expect all parents to shoulder the burden to cut off every possible source of adult content for their children , rather than the government 's addressing the problem at its source , " government lawyer Peter D Keisler wrote following the four - week hearing , the Associated Press news agency reported .
The law was never enforced because it was immediately challenged when it was passed and subject to a temporary injunction in 2004 on the grounds that it was likely to be struck down .
Studies Find Reward Often No Motivator
Creativity and intrinsic interest diminish if task is done for gain
by Alfie Kohn
Special to the Boston Globe
[ Reprinted with permission of the author from the Monday 19 January 1987 Boston Globe . ]
In the laboratory , rats get Rice Krispies .
In the classroom the top students get A's , and in the factory or office the best workers get raises .
It 's an article of faith for most of us that rewards promote better performance .
But a growing body of research suggests that this law is not nearly as ironclad as was once thought .
Psychologists have been finding that rewards can lower performance levels , especially when the performance involves creativity .
A related series of studies shows that intrinsic interest in a task — the sense that something is worth doing for its own sake — typically declines when someone is rewarded for doing it .
If a reward — money , awards , praise , or winning a contest — comes to be seen as the reason one is engaging in an activity , that activity will be viewed as less enjoyable in its own right .
With the exception of some behaviorists who doubt the very existence of intrinsic motivation , these conclusions are now widely accepted among psychologists .
Taken together , they suggest we may unwittingly be squelching interest and discouraging innovation among workers , students and artists .
The recognition that rewards can have counter - productive effects is based on a variety of studies , which have come up with such findings as these :
Young children who are rewarded for drawing are less likely to draw on their own that are children who draw just for the fun of it .
Teenagers offered rewards for playing word games enjoy the games less and do not do as well as those who play with no rewards .
Employees who are praised for meeting a manager 's expectations suffer a drop in motivation .
Much of the research on creativity and motivation has been performed by Theresa Amabile , associate professor of psychology at Brandeis University .
In a paper published early last year on her most recent study , she reported on experiments involving elementary school and college students .
Both groups were asked to make “ silly ” collages .
The young children were also asked to invent stories .
The least - creative projects , as rated by several teachers , were done by those students who had contracted for rewards .
“ It may be that commissioned work will , in general , be less creative than work that is done out of pure interest , ” Amabile said .
In 1985 , Amabile asked 72 creative writers at Brandeis and at Boston University to write poetry .
Some students then were given a list of extrinsic ( external ) reasons for writing , such as impressing teachers , making money and getting into graduate school , and were asked to think about their own writing with respect to these reasons .
Others were given a list of intrinsic reasons : the enjoyment of playing with words , satisfaction from self - expression , and so forth .
A third group was not given any list .
All were then asked to do more writing .
The results were clear .
Students given the extrinsic reasons not only wrote less creatively than the others , as judged by 12 independent poets , but the quality of their work dropped significantly .
Rewards , Amabile says , have this destructive effect primarily with creative tasks , including higher - level problem - solving .
“ The more complex the activity , the more it 's hurt by extrinsic reward , ” she said .
But other research shows that artists are by no means the only ones affected .
In one study , girls in the fifth and sixth grades tutored younger children much less effectively if they were promised free movie tickets for teaching well .
The study , by James Gabarino , now president of Chicago 's Erikson Institute for Advanced Studies in Child Development , showed that tutors working for the reward took longer to communicate ideas , got frustrated more easily , and did a poorer job in the end than those who were not rewarded .
Such findings call into question the widespread belief that money is an effective and even necessary way to motivate people .
They also challenge the behaviorist assumption that any activity is more likely to occur if it is rewarded .
Amabile says her research “ definitely refutes the notion that creativity can be operantly conditioned . ”
But Kenneth McGraw , associate professor of psychology at the University of Mississippi , cautions that this does not mean behaviorism itself has been invalidated .
“ The basic principles of reinforcement and rewards certainly work , but in a restricted context ” — restricted , that is , to tasks that are not especially interesting .
Researchers offer several explanations for their surprising findings about rewards and performance .
First , rewards encourage people to focus narrowly on a task , to do it as quickly as possible and to take few risks .
“ If they feel that ‘ this is something I have to get through to get the prize , ’ they 're going to be less creative , ” Amabile said .
Second , people come to see themselves as being controlled by the reward .
They feel less autonomous , and this may interfere with performance .
“ To the extent one 's experience of being self - determined is limited , ” said Richard Ryan , associate psychology professor at the University of Rochester , “ one 's creativity will be reduced as well . ”
Finally , extrinsic rewards can erode intrinsic interest .
People who see themselves as working for money , approval or competitive success find their tasks less pleasurable , and therefore do not do them as well .
The last explanation reflects 15 years of work by Ryan 's mentor at the University of Rochester , Edward Deci .
In 1971 , Deci showed that “ money may work to buy off one 's intrinsic motivation for an activity ” on a long - term basis .
Ten years later , Deci and his colleagues demonstrated that trying to best others has the same effect .
Students who competed to solve a puzzle quickly were less likely than those who were not competing to keep working at it once the experiment was over .
Control plays role
There is general agreement , however , that not all rewards have the same effect .
Offering a flat fee for participating in an experiment — similar to an hourly wage in the workplace — usually does not reduce intrinsic motivation .
It is only when the rewards are based on performing a given task or doing a good job at it — analogous to piece - rate payment and bonuses , respectively — that the problem develops .
The key , then , lies in how a reward is experienced .
If we come to view ourselves as working to get something , we will no longer find that activity worth doing in its own right .
There is an old joke that nicely illustrates the principle .
An elderly man , harassed by the taunts of neighborhood children , finally devises a scheme .
He offered to pay each child a dollar if they would all return Tuesday and yell their insults again .
They did so eagerly and received the money , but he told them he could only pay 25 cents on Wednesday .
When they returned , insulted him again and collected their quarters , he informed them that Thursday 's rate would be just a penny .
“ Forget it , ” they said — and never taunted him again .
Means to an end
In a 1982 study , Stanford psychologist Mark L. Lepper showed that any task , no matter how enjoyable it once seemed , would be devalued if it were presented as a means rather than an end .
He told a group of preschoolers they could not engage in one activity they liked until they first took part in another .
Although they had enjoyed both activities equally , the children came to dislike the task that was a prerequisite for the other .
It should not be surprising that when verbal feedback is experienced as controlling , the effect on motivation can be similar to that of payment .
In a study of corporate employees , Ryan found that those who were told , “ Good , you 're doing as you should ” were “ significantly less intrinsically motivated than those who received feedback informationally . ”
There 's a difference , Ryan says , between saying , “ I 'm giving you this reward because I recognize the value of your work ” and “ You 're getting this reward because you 've lived up to my standards . ”
A different but related set of problems exists in the case of creativity .
Artists must make a living , of course , but Amabile emphasizes that “ the negative impact on creativity of working for rewards can be minimized ” by playing down the significance of these rewards and trying not to use them in a controlling way .
Creative work , the research suggests , cannot be forced , but only allowed to happen .

Lindsay Lohan is allegedly romancing British actor Rhys Ifans .
The ' Mean Girls ' actress is said to have fallen for the 37 - year - old actor - best known for his role as Hugh Grant 's eccentric flatmate Spike in ' Notting Hill ' - after being introduced to him by her friend Kate Moss .
A source told Britain 's Daily Star newspaper : " Falling for Rhys was really the icing on the cake for Lindsay .
She already loves hanging out with Kate in London .
" One of the reasons Rhys appealed is that he 's so quirky , bright and refreshing .
" The flame - haired actress is apparently so infatuated with her new love , who is 17 years her senior , that she is planning to splash out on a London property so she can be closer to him .
Lohan , 20 , is also keen on buying a pad in the UK capital because she can legally drink in Britain .
The source added : " Lindsay is branded a hellraiser in the US because the legal drinking age is 21 .
" So it 's an amazing relief to be in England where things are more liberal .
She loves that it 's different here . "
Last week , Lohan confessed to having a crush on a mystery British man .
The ' Just My Luck ' star revealed she was smitten with a famous Londoner , but refused to reveal who .
She said : " There is a boy I like .
I 'm sure people will start writing about him soon .
He lives in London .
It 's so hard ! "

Jury Nullification
Patricia Tabram is in Carlisle Crown Court today charged with growing and possessing cannabis for personal use .
She 's 68 , a grandmother , uses the drug to relieve pain and she 's defending herself .
She 's admitted the facts but has pleaded not guilty .
She 's hoping that the Jury knows that they have the power of jury nullification .
( Jury Equity here in the UK ) .
That 's the ancient power of a jury to judge the law as bad rather than the defendent and bring back a ' not guilty ' verdict ( or a hung jury ) even where it flies in the face of the evidence .
Typically , a judge wo n't tell the jury of this power and inisist that they only consider the facts of the case .
Furthermore , a judge will typically hold a defendent in contempt if trying to educate the jury of their power .
She just has to hope that they already know .
It does n't seem the mainstream media is rushing to educate people either - this Sky News report does n't mention jury nullification , even though it 's clearly relevant in this case .
In the UK , where mass protest is largely ignored , voting has little impact , and complaining on the internet does squat , jury nullification is a real power that reasonable people have to reject unreasonable laws .
But only if people are aware of it .
Let 's hope Patricia Tabram gets lucky and gets a fully informed jury today .

Thanks for mentioning this , Alexander .
I 'm not sure of the history of this counterbalance in the UK , but in the US a " trail by a jury of ones peers " judged all aspects of the case , including the fairness or sanity of the law as passed by the legislature .
Today , though , judges routinely instruct that jurors must follow the letter of the law , and not judge the law itself , during a trial .
I 'm not sure how they get away with that .
( I 've been dismissed from a jury pool when I told the judge that I could not condemn someone for what I considered an unfair piece of legislation . )

Thanks for the link , JD .
Sounds like US jurors face more scrutiny to ensure they are not fully informed !
I 'm not sure how that differs from stacking the jury .
I 've never been selected for jury service , but I understand that here in the UK jurors are simply asked " Can you give a fair hearing to both the crown and the defense ? " - I think I 'd be able answer in the affirmitive and still fulfill all my duties as a juror .

I was amazed to recently discover of Jury Equity / Jury Nullification - amazed that Jurors are not informed of their Legal Right to effectively way judgment on the Law as well as any alleged crime being judged .
It strikes me that this is one tool that absolutely MUST remain law , and additionally that Jurors MUST be informed of prior to them sitting on a Jury , after all , Jurors are often told to reach a verdict based upon the UK Law , whilst not being told that the UK Law also allows them to reach a verdict of NOT GUILTY on the grounds of the Law itself being flawed .
How can a trial by Jury be legally fair , if the Jury is not aware of their own legal rights ?

AS USUAL , America 's Supreme Court ended its annual term this week by delivering a clutch of controversial decisions .
The one that caught the attention of businessmen , and plenty of music lovers , was a ruling concerning the rampant downloading of free music from the internet .
Nine elderly judges might have been forgiven for finding the entire subject somewhat baffling .
In fact , their lengthy written decisions on the case betray an intense interest , as well as a great deal of knowledge .
Moreover , they struck what looks like the best available balance under current laws between the claims of media firms , which are battling massive infringements of their copyrights , and tech firms , which are keen to keep the doors to innovation wide open ( see article ) .
This case is only the latest episode in a long - running battle between media and technology companies .
In 1984 , in a case involving Sony 's Betamax video recorder , the Supreme Court ruled that technology firms are not liable if their users infringe copyright , provided the device is “ capable of substantial non-infringing uses ” .
For two decades , this served as a green light for innovations .
Apple 's iTunes , the legal offspring of illegal internet file - sharing , is among the happy results .
But lately , things have turned against the techies .
In 2000 , a California court shut down Napster , a distributor of peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file - sharing software .
It had , the court decided , failed to stop copyright violations ( though the firm relaunched as a legal online - music retailer ) .
In its ruling this week , the court unanimously took the view that two other P2P firms , Grokster and StreamCast , could be held liable if they encourage users to infringe copyrights .
The vast majority of content that is swapped using their software infringes copyrights , which media firms say eats into their sales .
Although the software firms argued they should not be responsible for their customers ' actions , the court found that they could be sued if they actually encouraged the infringement , and said that there was evidence that they had done so .
On the other hand , the court did not go as far as media firms demanded : they wanted virtually any new technology to be vulnerable to legal action if it allowed any copyright infringement at all .
Turning customers into pirates
Both the entertainment and technology industries have legitimate arguments .
Media firms should be able to protect their copyrights .
And without any copyright protection of digital content , they may be correct that new high quality content is likely to dry up ( along with much of their business ) .
Yet tech and electronics firms are also correct that holding back new technology , merely because it interferes with media firms ' established business models , stifles innovation and is an unjustified restraint of commerce .
The music industry is only now embracing online sales ( and even experimenting itself with P2P ) because rampant piracy has demonstrated what consumers really want , and forced these firms to respond .
The Supreme Court tried to steer a middle path between these claims , and did a reasonable job .
But the outcome of the case is nevertheless unsatisfactory .
That 's not the court 's fault .
It was struggling to apply a copyright law which has grown worse than anachronistic in the digital age .
That 's something Congress needs to remedy .
In America , the length of copyright protection has increased enormously over the past century , from around 28 years to as much as 95 years .
The same trend can be seen in other countries .
In June Britain signalled that it may extend its copyright term from 50 years to around 90 years .
This makes no sense .
Copyright was originally intended to encourage publication by granting publishers a temporary monopoly on works so they could earn a return on their investment .
But the internet and new digital technologies have made the publication and distribution of works much easier and cheaper .
Publishers should therefore need fewer , not more , property rights to protect their investment .
Technology has tipped the balance in favour of the public domain .
A first , useful step would be a drastic reduction of copyright back to its original terms — 14 years , renewable once .
This should provide media firms plenty of chance to earn profits , and consumers plenty of opportunity to rip , mix , burn their back catalogues without breaking the law .
The Supreme Court has somewhat reluctantly clipped the wings of copyright pirates ; it is time for Congress to do the same to the copyright incumbents .
At the present moment ( August , 1853 ) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago , in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time , in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds , which is A FRIENDLY SUIT , and which is ( I am assured ) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun .
Charles Dickens , Preface to Bleak House
The case had been frequently before this court in various aspects ; first , in 13 Peters , 404 , then in 15 Peters , 9 , 2 Howard , 619 , 6 Howard , 552 , 15 Howard , 473 .
In some of these reports large extracts are made from the record , illustrating the points of law and fact then under consideration , and also the evidence in support of them .
All of this past history was brought again to the notice of the court in the argument of the present case , which can not be again recited in the present report .
The reader who wishes to understand all the points which are discussed in the opinion of the court must turn back to the preceding volumes above cited , and follow the case through its successive developments .
He will then be able to appreciate the concluding remark in the opinion of the court , which is as follows :
" When hereafter some distinguished American lawyer shall retire from his practice to write the history of his country 's jurisprudence , this case will be registered by him as the most remarkable in the records of its courts . "

New Orleans v. Whitney
sixteen times
eight times
The events that formed the basis for the Gaines case began in 1787 when Daniel Clark arrived in New Orleans to join his uncle , Colonel Daniel Clark , in business .
Ten years later , Colonel Clark conveyed all of his extensive property in Louisiana to his nephew , and at the age of thirty , Daniel Clark found himself one of the richest men in North America .
Clark 's many business ventures brought him large revenues that he invested primarily in New Orleans real estate .
During the early years of the nineteenth century , as he established himself in New Orleans as " a man of much personal pride and social ambition , " Clark became romantically involved with a young Frenchwoman .
All accounts of Zuileme Carrière emphasized her extraordinary beauty , vivacity , and charm , and both sides of the lawsuit admitted Clark 's fascination with her .
Myra , daughter of Clark and Carrière , later came to believe that her parents had contracted a legal , though secret , marriage , making her the true heir to Clark 's fortune .
As she grew up , however , she was raised by friends of Clark and kept in ignorance of her real parentage as well as of her father 's death in 1813 , when she was nine .
Nearly twenty years afterward , Myra and her young husband arrived in New Orleans with a tale of a lost will and a claim that she was the true heir .
Few believed her story .
For the rest of her life , as a young wife and mother , as the third wife of a prominent general , and as a widow , Myra Clark Gaines pursued the vindication of her " rights . "

As he was writing Bleak House over the course of 1852 & 1853 , Charles Dickens was aware of numerous cases mired for decades in the Courts of Chancery .
Although his case of Jarndyce & Jarndyce was fiction , he knew the plodding reputation of the English courts at the time would make his case appear real to his 19 Century British audience .
What Dickens probably did not know at the time , was that on this side of the Atlantic a woman named Myra Clark Gaines had already been pursuing a claim to an estate for almost twenty years .
What Dickens could not have known at the time was that the Gaines Case would continue for almost , becoming the longest case in the history of the U.S. judiciary .
Her case , originally filed in 1834 would not be fully resolved until 1892 , almost sixty years later .
Beginning with her first lawsuit in 1834 and culminating within 1891 , the Supreme Court of the United States heard issues concerning the Gaines case an astoundingand the Louisiana Supreme Court heard the caseWhat was at issue in the Myra Clark Gaines Case ?
For the answer , we turn to Elizabeth Urban Alexander 's Notorious Woman : The Celebrated Case Of Myra Clark Gaines , a 300 - page biography of Ms. Gaines published in 2001 : Besides its longevity , the Gaines case is legally interesting for a number of reasons .
First and foremost , the Gaines case is a case about antebellum federal power — particularly about the scope of federal power in a state jurisdiction governed by civil law .
Moreover , the case concerns the use of federal equity jurisdiction to govern a matter of domestic relations , an area where today 's federal courts are loathe to exert their influence .
Many of the appeals in the case reflect the reticence of courts sitting in Louisiana — even federal courts — to apply federal equity jurisprudence .
The parties opposing Ms. Gaines ( protecting the estate of her father ) frequently argued before the court that equity had no place in Louisiana .
In , one of their many SCOTUS appeals , the estate administrators maintained that federal equity jurisprudence constituted " foreign law " inapplicable in the equity - free zone of Louisiana .
In 1885 , Ms. Gaines died , 6 years before the case came to its ultimate conclusion in her favor .
After winning the final case before the U.S. Supreme Court the year before , on July 26 , 1892 , the administrator of her estate received a check for $ 923,788 from the city of New Orleans ( which had received the Clark estate ) , ending the litigation .
As you 'd expect , creditors had significant claims against this sum , and little remained for the Gaines heirs to divide up .
If you want to know more about the Gaines case , I encourage you to check out Elizabeth Urban Alexander 's Notorious Woman : The Celebrated Case Of Myra Clark Gaines or ( if you do n't want to leave the friendly confines ofor ) check outby Kristin L. Collins .

Do n't wait for the muse
Yet another benefit of constraint - driven creativity is that you do n't have time to wait for the muse to show up .
And as film critic Roger Ebert told an audience of would - be filmmakers and musicians , " The muse never shows up at the beginning . "
You have to start doing something and trust the muse will follow , not the other way 'round .
I came across this Federico Fellini quote today , and it seemed to echo what others have been saying about everything from software design to business ideas :
" I do n't believe in total freedom for the artist .
Left on his own , free to do anything he likes , the artist ends up doing nothing at all .
If there 's one thing that 's dangerous for an artist , it 's precisely this question of total freedom , waiting for inspiration and all the rest of it . "
It 's from a book I 'm enjoying called Hillman Curtis on Creating Short Films for the Web ( there 's a short review of the book on Speak Up )
My favorite tool for creativity - on - demand is still mind - mapping .
You start with that one circle in the center and draw / write as quickly as you can .
The more you think , the less effective it is .
You 'll always find things on the paper you did n't expect ... things you did n't know were in your head .
But whatever you use , and whether you 're writing , drawing , composing , coding , designing , whatever ... just DO something .
Or as Ray Bradbury put it in another quote from the book :
Life is " trying things to see if they work . "
You can't try things if you 're waiting for the muse to show up first .
And if you want inspiration , it 's everywhere including :

I just keep a moleskin with me -- or if I 'm feeling more techy my Palm - - at all times and when something odd , funny , interesting , different , thought provoking happens I jot down the key words to help me remember the event .
Then I do n't write until the mood is striking , usually early in the morning , and often I preface a writing session with re-reading old posts or journal entries to get me thinking .
Works for me .
A fabulous book I read recently and reviewed at http://scribbit.blogspot.com/2006/11/midnight-disease.html called The Midnight Disease was about writing and brain function which gave me plenty to think about how I 'm writing , what sparks creativity and how brain functions inhibit / promote artistic endeavors .

This is sort of connected to ... moods & emotions !
One popular perception of modern society goes like this - " oh but I am not in the mood , or I dont feel inspired " blah blah .
Is it not possible to explore , control & harness the emotions , and being in the driver 's seat , rather than the other way around ?

Thanks Kathy , for allowing the " shameless promotion " thing :-)
My blog http://www.adaptivelearningonline.net is my attempt to help developers with continuous learning .
In the process of doing some research and by working with clients , I am coming to the conclusion that learning ( in software development and probably other fields ) is best done in continuous mode rather than in spurts .
My blog is an attempt to enable learning through conversations using blogs and podcasts .
I also plan to start screencasting soon .
The primary focus of the blog is to help people with 0 - 2 years of software development experience , improve their coding and object oriented design skills .
Any feedback will be really appreciated .
Over time I want this be a real " kick ass " site ... but I am limited by my own perceptions of how learning can happen and what people will find useful .
I hope to overcome that with user feedback and refactorings to the site , material , and mode of offering learning sessions .

I 'm not sure I totally agree Kathy .
For sure , waiting for the muse to strike is a thankless task but , while you have to be disciplined in your approach and while perspiration begets inspiration as Ebert suggests , I 'm not sure that the muse can be cajoled into appearance .
Based on no knowledge whatsoever , I always see the muse as the upshot of the percolation of all that stuff floating around our brain .
Thus , all the blogs and resources you list should indeed be part of one 's daily / weekly / monthly ritual that feed said brain and said muse , but there are times when you just have to walk away and use that time for the more mundane stuff which your brain is telling you it 's up for .
Or am I simply justifying my indolence ?

Kathy , I experience the benefits of time constraint and just starting every day at the moment .
I take on stuff I 'm not 100 % sure I can do and I usually have to do them in a very short amount of time .
It forces me to be creative and to push the boundaries I come up against .
However I agree with John Dodds as well .
I often have the best ideas in the shower , while commuting , shopping , baking , cleaning or while just sitting in my favorite chair or over a glass of wine with some friends .
If your brain is relaxed or challenged it comes up with the most interesting things .
One of my most stable sources for inspiration is Goodie ( http://www.goodie.org).
It 's a small magazine featuring one interview per issue .
The people they interview are invariably like no one I 've ever met ; unique , original and occasionally weird .

Creativity Tools :
Walking , Showering , Talking to others about the problem , Talking to others about something other than the problem , MindMapping , Freewriting , doodling , jotting down notes , structuring and re-structuring the notes , switch from verbal to visual , switch from visual to verbal , take a step back to see the bigger picture ( aka context ) , sleeping , switching the medium ( from computer to pen&paper and vice versa ) , creating outlines ( in Word or on paper ) , reviewing outlines , fleshing out outlines , reinventing outlines , getting something to eat or to drink , washing up , reading up on a wide variety of topics , ...
And not to forget : the precious moment after you sent out the ( e ) mail which detailed your problem and why you ca n’t possibly solve it at the moment – which invariably ( OK , often ) results in having The Right Idea ( TM ) .
Kathy , keep up the good work !

I do n't believe in " the muse " .
I believe in filling the well regularly , cross-pollinating from different fields , directed daydreaming , mind - mapping , and just getting down to work .
Once you get started , the ideas come .
I wonder sometimes if I 'm the only artist in the world who * does n 't * believe I have a " muse " ...hmmm ...
I try to regularly provide mini online artist dates for my readers at http://www.layersuponlayers.com/ by pointing them to sites and projects that will help with filling the creative well with new ideas .
And my jewelry blog provides many tutorials and tips for those who feel they need a nudge in being creative http://mazeltovjewelry.blogspot.com/
Kathy , I hope that someone , anyone , will find one of these sites helpful , because I feel that techie people can benefit from the arts just like I benefit from exposure to tech - world :-)

Kathy , I find the same thing is true with podcast topics , for example .
A lot of times I hear people say things like , " But we do n't have enough to talk about for 50 podcasts ! "
Once they 're conditioned to look around them for potential topics , of course , they find 100 topics without breaking a sweat .
It 's what Barry Welford called " keeping the radar screen on . "
I can't do self - promotion without a little shame , but I 'll do it nonetheless .
My blog comes from the perspective of a ' new media ' guy in a an ' old media ' company , helping people see that they can now produce the same kinds of programming that has been reserved for big media companies in the past .

Spot - on about the creative process , Kathy .
Unless it 's just a hobby , one needs to keep moving ( literally or figuratively ) to create the space for inspiration to happen .
As for my bit to share , I write The YouBlog -- practical ideas on presentations , persuasion , selling and communications .
It 's kind of a cross between Creating Passionate Users and Presentation Zen .
You can find it at http://youblog.typepad.com.
Thanks for all you share with us !

I have found plenty of ideas here ( blog entries and links to other resources ) .
I do n't sit around waiting for the muse .
I read as much as I can , explore the Web , talk to friends and coworker .
I also make sure that I have always got a pen and paper nearby , because you never know when the muse will pop into your head .
I also make sure that I get away from the computer and the office .
Outdoor activities and exercise are great creativity boosters .
My business partner taught me about " idea quotas . "
If you force ( constrain ) yourself to write down 10 ideas a day ( they wo n't all be good ) , then , by the end of the week you will have 70 things to sort through ... at least one will be decent , or can be the seed of a great idea .
Thanks for the self - promotion opportunity .
Our company is building a " Global Nation for Creatives . "
We are creating a place where people can showcase their talents .
Our " Muzeum " will be a place that people can visit for inspiration , or to break through the dreaded creativity block .
Our community site will be live in mid-December .
In the meantime , you might find some ideas here oddpodz

Do practise running lightly and quietly .
Pounding and foot - slapping are a sign that something is wrong with your technique - you are wasting energy and jarring your whole system .
Do n't allow your head to bob or roll à la Paula Radcliffe .
The head weighs about 10 lbs , so a nodding movement is going to place a tremendous load on the rest of the body , creating tension in the shoulders and putting pressure on the spine .
Focusing your gaze 20 to 30 metres ahead helps .
Do vary the speed of your runs .
Research published in the Journal of Applied Physiology last year found that six minutes of short , flat - out sprints gave similar results to long , slow runs that required several hours of training a week .
Do n't avoid hills , however tempting .
Running repetitions up hills ( fast up , slow down ) is the outdoor equivalent of strength training .
And it seems so much easier when you return to flat ground .
Do lengthen your stride .
Ideally , a long - distance runner should take 170 - 190 strides per minute .
If you take many more than that , you are probably not running efficiently .
Do n't allow your wrists to flap around .
A common mistake is to assume that flopping your hands means a relaxed style - in fact it creates tension , as the shoulders tighten to pick up the slack .
The best exercise ?
The hamstring stretch .
Generally , sports scientists agree that it is more beneficial to stretch after a run ( warm up beforehand with a gentle jog ) .
Although it 's important to stretch all major muscles , the hamstrings need particular attention .
Stand in front of a low desk or dining chair ( just above knee height ) and extend one leg to place on the surface .
Put your hands on your hips and keep the raised foot relaxed .
Reach forward from the hips , keeping your pelvis straight and the knee of the raised leg straight and the supporting leg slightly flexed .
Hold for several seconds .
Repeat on the other side .
NSAIDs are used to treat chronic pain in conditions such as arthritis
The guidance is being issued by the Commission on Human Medicines .
British Medical Journal research published in June found taking the drugs meant an extra three people in a thousand would have such conditions .
However , the warnings do not apply to the much lower doses of ibuprofen which can be bought over - the - counter .
The lowest effective doses of NSAIDs should be taken for the shortest time necessary
Dr June Raine , Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
Millions of people take this class of drugs , called NSAIDs ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) , to help relieve conditions such as chronic pain and arthritis .
The drugs examined in the review were diclofenac , etodolac , ibuprofen , indomethacin , ketoprofen , ketorolac , meloxicam , nabumetone , naproxen , nimesulide and piroxicam - which is still being assessed .
The committee 's recommendations have been accepted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , which oversees the safety of drugs used in the UK .
The MHRA is now to write to manufacturers of NSAIDs .
' Do n't stop taking medication '
Dr June Raine , the MHRA 's director of vigilance and risk management , said : " NSAIDs are important medicines and the balance of benefits and risks remains positive .
" The lowest effective doses of NSAIDs should be taken for the shortest time necessary for the control of symptoms .
" There is no need for patients to stop taking their medicines and there is no urgent need for patients to switch between NSAIDs , if they are feeling well .
" Anyone who is concerned about their treatment should talk to their doctor in the first instance . "
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) , which has looked at the new evidence , has ruled that the benefits of the NSAID drugs still outweigh any increased risks .
The EMEA said : " The Committee confirmed its previous advice for doctors and patients to continue to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to control symptoms .
" As for all medicinal products marketed in the European Union , non-selective NSAIDs are being continuously monitored , and appropriate actions will be taken if any concerns arise . "
And Ellen Mason , a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation said : " There has been a mounting body of evidence that taking high doses of NSAIDs increases the chances of having a heart attack .
" However , the increased risk is small , and the EMEA have concluded that it is outweighed by the benefits of pain - relief for patients with conditions such as arthritis .
" We welcome their recommendations that most people should use the lowest dose of NSAIDs for the shortest amount of time possible .
" We are pleased the EMEA will continue to review the use of NSAIDs . "
Questions about the Hummer would be off - limits .
That ’s what the mayor ’s press secretary told me as we headed to a City Hall meeting with transportation chief Jaime de la Vega , whose vehicle of choice seems odd for a man in his position .
No way , I told Matt Szabo .
How can I not ask about it ?
What de la Vega drives is a private matter , argued Szabo .
No it is n’t , I told him .
It ’s now a public matter , and I do n’t know how Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa can have any faith in a transit chief who drives a 2 - ton monster in a city with notorious traffic and smog .
Advertisement
It ’s like having a surgeon general who smokes unfiltered Camels while snacking on Cheetos .
I felt a little sorry for Szabo , a decent enough chap who had arranged the meeting after I complained that de la Vega did n’t answer my call .
But not sorry enough to pull punches .
What ’s with the Hummer ?
I asked as soon as we were seated in de la Vega ’s office .
De la Vega gave me a cold stare , his lips sealed .
Then he looked at Szabo , who said we were there to talk transportation .
Advertisement
I asked about de la Vega ’s background and he dropped the mummy act , telling me he ’d gotten a master ’s in urban planning from UCLA .
He was also Mayor Dick Riordan ’s traffic chief and a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board .
So you ’d think he ’d know better .
I just ca n’t get past it , I told de la Vega .
A Hummer ?
And then I noticed a quote on his wall from Rosa Parks .
Advertisement
“ Every person must live their lives as a model for others . ”
I read the quote to de la Vega , who clammed up again .
“ Should we all drive Hummers ? ” I asked .
Silence .
Advertisement
Szabo , meanwhile , looked like he might have some kind of a breakdown .
He argued that de la Vega ’s vehicle is not the largest in the Hummer line .
“ It ’s smaller than a Yukon , ” he said .
Wonderful .
So is the Queen Mary .
The polar caps are melting , we are at war in the oil fields and Mr. Transit is driving a hog that says who cares ?
Advertisement
But for Szabo ’s sake , I changed the subject , asking de la Vega if he ’d checked out all the great ideas on my Bottleneck Blog ( latimes.com / bottleneck ) , where people are posting solutions to our traffic mess .
He said he had n’t looked at it , which is his loss .
De la Vega said he ’s looking at everything from charging people to drive in congested areas to creating one - way thoroughfares to synchronizing every light in the city .
But the larger plan is to “ maintain a first - class bus system ” and get the Exposition light - rail line going , extend the Gold Line to the San Gabriel Valley and the Eastside , take the Green Line to the airport and the Red Line to the sea .
Advertisement
Sounds lovely , except that the city does n’t have $ 27 billion sitting around , and even if it did , the mayor has n’t sold me on whether rail would be the best use of that money in a city where people go in a million different directions to get here and there .
Even at that , it would take years to get any of those lines in place , and we ’ve got a crisis now .
De la Vega said the city is looking at twisting the governor ’s arm and turning up the heat on Washington as well as considering a sales tax or a bond .
“ There is no magic wand , ” he said .
Yeah , no kidding .
There ’s not even a formal transit plan for the city to begin debating .
Advertisement
It would help , I told de la Vega and Szabo , if the mayor and other public officials stopped taking huge campaign checks from developers and rubber - stamping their projects until we get some of the transit in place .
Villaraigosa , if you ask me , is now testing the limits of big ambition .
How much more might he have accomplished by now if he had n’t devoted so much time to a school takeover bid that so far has been a disaster ?
We did n’t elect him to run the school district , and he already has a full plate with homelessness , housing and public safety .
Before he takes on the schools , too , he should use his popularity and gift of gab to step up on traffic , which affects millions of people every day and is redefining our lives , wasting time , money and productivity .
An uninspired City Council is asleep at the wheel on this issue , by the way , offering the mayor little or no help .
But it ’s Villaraigosa who should use his million - dollar smile to charm people out of their vehicles at least one day a week , encouraging them to use transit , bicycles , carpools and flexible work schedules .
And given the depth of its problems , Los Angeles and the surrounding region ought to have the smartest and most enviro - friendly innovations in the world rather than having to read about what works in London or Bangkok , Argentina or Brazil .
Advertisement
I do n’t want to hear that it ca n’t be done , and I ca n’t think of a better way for City Hall to show it ’s serious than to have Villaraigosa take de la Vega ’s Hummer and ship it to the troops in Iraq , where it might come in handy .
Or he could trade it to the governor for a bigger chunk of state transit funding .
I told him if they ca n’t work a deal , I ’ll be happy to drive his tank back to the dealer and trade it in on a nice Honda or something .
De la Vega did n’t respond , but I could tell he was beginning to see the wisdom of unloading this thing .
All right , I told him .
We ’ll trade vehicles for a week .
He can gradually warm to the idea of a car that ’s smaller than Half Dome , and I ’ll be high enough off the ground to get a better look at just how awful the traffic has become .

There was this couple that had been married for 20 years .
Every timethey made love the husband always insisted on shutting off thelight .
Well , after 20 years the wife felt this was ridiculous .
She figuredshe would break him out of this crazy habit .
So one night , while theywere in the middle of a wild , screaming , romantic session , she turned onthe lights .
She looked down .
and saw her husband was holding abattery - operated leisure device ... a vibrator !
Soft , wonderful and larger than a real one .
She went completely ballistic .
" You impotent bastard , " She screamedat him , " how could you be lying to me all of these years ?
You betterexplain yourself !

Apache Lenya - Open Source Content Management ( Java / XML )
Table of Contents
Apache Lenya is an Open Source Java / XML
Content Management System and comes with revision control , multi-site management , scheduling , search , WYSIWYG editors , and workflow .
Please see some screenshots or try it for yourself .
Downloads
The current stable version of Apache Lenya is 2.0.4 .
This is the recommended version for production use .
You will at least need the Java 2 Platform , Standard Edition , version 1.4.2 .
Please follow the installation instructions .
At the moment we do n't provide binary versions , you 'll find more information on the download page .
Features
If you have additional requirements beyond the features listed below , you have access to all Apache Cocoon features to develop them .
Authoring
Browser - based WYSIWYG
Editors are provided that validate input against a RELAX NG Schema .
This prevents invalid markup as produced by other WYSIWYG editors and enables enforcement of web site style guidelines .
Lenya ships with the BXE and Kupu editors out of the box .
Asset management and link management are integrated into BXE and Kupu .
A forms editor is available for situations where a full - blown WYSIWYG editor is overkill or where legacy browsers need to be supported .
Pages that are being edited are automatically locked for other users , preventing conflicting changes to the same page .
Each edit of a page creates a new revision , and you can revert to any previous revision of a page .
Workflow
Lenya includes a customizable workflow engine that uses an easy XML format to define workflows .
Standard one - and two - stage workflows are included .
Users can be notified by email about pending approvals .
Workflow events such as publishing or deactivating a page can be scheduled .
Separate authoring , staging and live areas are supported .
For convenience , the staging area is disabled by default .
All workflow steps are logged , providing an audit trail .
Internationalization
Pages can be created in multiple languages with no impact on your site structure .
Lenya automatically displays your page in the default languge if it is not available in a specific language .
The user interface is currently localized in Spanish , Italian , French , German , English , Dutch and Japanese .
Layout
The " publications " concept allows reuse of the information architecture of a site and brings modularity to the content level .
Different publications ( sites ) can share content and business logic , and new publications can be created with a cloning process .
XHTML+CSS templating is supported , eliminating the need to learn yet another templating language .
Wherever possible , Lenya uses CSS for styling , thereby enforcing the separation of content and layout .
The navigation framework automatically creates navigation items such as menus , breadcrumb paths and tabs .
A site map can be easily created .
Lenya produces clean URLs without request parameters and is thus optimally accessible to search engines .
There are no restrictions on the nesting of templates .
You can use any template you have defined at any level of your site structure thanks to the URI parameterizer .
Site Management
You can move , copy , rename , archive or delete individual pages or whole parts of your site with an easy to use site view that shows you the pages of your site in an explorer - like view .
Each page has tabs for easy access to meta data , assets , workflow status , revisions , access control and scheduling .
The archive function allows you to deactiviate pages and store them in an archive .
Deleted pages can be retrieved from the trash .
Each page can have Dublin Core metadata assigned .
Other metadata standards can be added if required .
Asset management allows you to keep track of images and documents that belong to a page .
Link management ensures that internal links are not shown if the target page does n't exist or the user has no access to it .
Link management also warns users about broken links when they publish a page .
Before publishing a page , Lenya checks whether parent pages are already published , to avoid inconsistent sites .
Deployment is flexible : Sites can be served dynamically by the authoring server ( for small deployments ) or another servlet container .
It is also possible to export content statically or to use Apache HTTP Server as a proxy .
If used with a reverse proxy , URLs can be rewritten based on the site structure of the live site .
Security
Each page or parts of your site can be protected by SSL .
You can protect just the parts of your site that need protection for best performance .
The access control mechanism allows you to restrict access to parts of your site to members of a group or individuals .
You can restrict access by function , such as viewing , editing , approval or administration .
Users can be authenticated against an LDAP server .
Access can also be controlled by IP ranges .
Misc
A Windows Installer makes installation on Windows a 3 - click process .
( The binary version and installer are not available in the release 2.0 .
You find more information on the download page . )
Apache Lucene is integrated for full - text and fielded searching .

Part 4 of a 4 - part series of short posts intended to clear out my bloggestive tract .
Hold your nose !
Well , I held out for a week .
Then I read the comments .
Argh !
Actually they were fine .
Nice comments , all around .
Whew .
I do n't have any big themes to talk about today , but I 've got a couple of little ones , let 's call 'em bloguettes , that I 'll lump together into a medley for today 's entree .
I was in Barnes today , doing my usual weekend stroll through the tech section .
Helps me keep up on the latest trends .
And would n't you know it , I skipped a few weeks there , and suddenly Ruby and Rails have almost as many books out as Python .
I counted eleven Ruby / RoR titles tonight , and thirteen for Python ( including one Zope book ) .
And Ruby had a big display section at the end of one of the shelves .
Not all the publishers were O'Reilly and Pragmatic Press .
I 'm pretty sure there were two or three others there , so it 's not just a plot by Tim O'Reilly to sell more books .
Well , actually that 's exactly what it is , but it 's based on actual market research that led him to the conclusion that Rails and Ruby are both gathering steam like nobody 's business .
I like a lot of languages .
Really , I do .
But I use Ruby .
I 'm not even sure if I like Ruby .
The issue might just be irrelevant to whether I use it .
I like OCaml , for instance , but I do n't use it .
I do n't like Java , but I do use it .
Liking and using are mostly orthogonal dimensions , and if you like the language you 're using even a little bit , you 're lucky .
That , or you just have n't gotten broad enough exposure to know how miserable you ought to be .
I use Ruby because it 's been the path of least resistance for most of my programming tasks since about 3 days after I started messing with it , maybe 4 years ago .
I do n't even really know Ruby all that well .
I never bothered to learn it .
I did read " Ruby in a Nutshell " cover - to - cover , but it 's a short read ( and it 's a bit out of date now . )
Then I read bits of " Programming Ruby " , but not all of it .
And now I use Ruby for everything I can , any time I have any choice in the matter .
I do n't even mind that I do n't know the language all that well .
It has a tiny core that serves me admirably well , and it 's easy to look things up when you need to .
I do a lot more programming in Python than in Ruby -- Jython in my game server , and Python at work , since that 's what everyone there uses for scripting .
I have maybe 3 x more experience with Python than with Ruby ( and 10 x more experience with Perl ) .
But Perl and Python both have more unnecessary conceptual overhead , so I find I have to consult the docs more often with both of them .
And when all 's said and done , Ruby code generally winds up being the most direct and succinct , whether it 's mine or someone else 's .
I have a lot of trouble writing about Ruby , because I find there 's nothing to say .
It 's why I almost never post to the O'Reilly Ruby blog .
Ruby seems so self - explanatory to me .
It makes it almost boring ; you try to focus on Ruby and you wind up talking about some problem domain instead of the language .
I think that 's the goal of all programming languages , but so far Ruby 's one of the few to succeed at it so well .
If only it performed better .
* Sigh * .
Well , its performance is in the same class as Perl / Python / JavaScript / Lua / Bash / etc. , so there are still plenty of tasks Ruby 's admirably suited for .
I think next year Ruby 's going to be muscling in on Perl in terms of mindshare , or shelf - share , at B &N. I still do most of my programming in Java -- at least half of it , maybe more .
The Java platform continues to make amazing strides .
The newest incarnation ( JDK 6 ) has lots of goodies I can't wait to play with .
Like Rhino , for instance , and although they appear to have gutted it , it 's still awesome .
I think it 's the best choice they possibly could have made .
Thank God they did n't bundle Groovy .
What a catastrophe that was , and still is , and would have been for Java if they 'd bundled it .
Rhino rocks .
The JVM is just getting faster and more stable , and there are even some OK libraries that come with it .
I used to think the Java platform libraries were the cat 's meow .
Heck , I thought they were the whole damn cat .
But working with better libraries in miscellaneous other languages has got me thinking that Java 's libraries are hit - or - miss .
Example : Java 's concurrency libraries ( java.util.concurrent [.*] ) are to die for .
I mean , if you 're stuck with threads .
I think in the fullness of time , hand - managed threads will be history , but in the meantime , Java 's concurrency libraries are just superb .
I recently ported a medium - sized Python program I 'd written ( about 1200 lines of fairly dense Python code ) to Java , because the Python was taking about an hour to run , and I wanted to parallelize the work .
I spent about 3 days doing the rewrite : one day on the straight port , a day adding in the threading , and a day fine - tuning it .
The straight port wound up as 1300 lines of Java ( surprising that it was n't bigger , but maybe I code in Python with a Java accent ? ) , and ran about 50 % faster , down to about 30 minutes .
After adding in the threading and state machine , the program ran in 50 to 60 seconds .
So I got an order of magnitude improvement with only about a 50 % increase overall in program size .
The vast majority of the improvement was attributable to the threading , which in turn would have taken me FAR longer if I 'd been using raw synchronization primitives .
The java.util.concurrent stuff made it a snap .
On the other hand , Java 's DOM implementation completely blows chunks .
It quickly became the bottleneck in my application , due to an O ( n ) algorithm I stumbled across with no good workaround for .
I can't remember exactly where it was ( this was back in July ) , but I found a sheepishly apologetic comment from the author in the online docs .
It was something to do with setting attributes on nodes while you 're doing a traversal of some sort : something you 'd definitely want to be fast , but it had at least linear performance , maybe worse , and now accounts for 95 + % of my app 's processing time .
And of course Java 's DOM interface blows too , because you can't create subclasses or decorators or do anything useful with the DOM other than use it as a temp container until you 've transfered the data to something more flexible .
Java 's collections library is decent , but not superb .
It 's nice having the data structures they provide , but they 're not very configurable , and the language itself makes them often cumbersome .
For instance , you can have a WeakHashMap ( nice ) , or an IdentityHashMap ( nice ) , or a ConcurrentHashMap ( also nice ) , but you can't combine any two of those three properties into a single hashtable .
Lame .
And java.util is missing implementations and / or interfaces for a bunch of important data types like priority queues ( you 're stuck using a TreeSet , which is overkill ) , the disjoint set ADT , splay trees , bloom filters , multi-maps , and of course any kind of built - in graph support .
Java hyper - enthusiasts will tell you : " well , go write your own !
Or use one of the many hopefully robust implementations on the web ! "
That seems lame to me .
We 're talking about data structures here : they 're more fundamental than , say , LDAP libraries and much of the other stuff Sun 's bundling these days .
It 's smartest to provide robust , tuned implementations of these things , because it empowers average Java programmers to write faster , more reliable code .
Oh , and let 's not even get me started with java.nio .
What a mess !
It 's pretty gross , especially if you come from the comparatively simple background of select ( ) and poll ( ) on Unix .
But maybe the grossness was necessary .
I 'll give them the benefit of the doubt .
What bugs me is n't that the API is conceptually weird and complex ( and buggy as hell last time I checked ) ; what bugs me is that nobody at Sun bothered to put a layer atop java .nio for ordinary programmers .
Like , say , a nonblocking DataInputStream that takes a type to read , a Buffer , and a callback to call when it 's finished reading .
So every frigging Java programmer on the planet has to write that exact class -- or just flail around with the raw APIs , which is what I think most of them do .
And look what they did to poor LDAP !
I mean , the LDAP bindings are dirt - simple in every language I 've ever used .
It 's supposed to be lightweight -- that 's what the " L " stands for , fer cryin ' out loud .
JNDI is this huge monster .
So is JMX .
I mean , Java libraries have this way of being so bloated and overengineered .
But whatever ; I 've digressed .
Java 's libraries are not its biggest failing .
The libraries ( as I said ) are decent , and the platform ( in terms of tools , speed , reliability , documentation , portability , monitoring , etc. ) really raises the bar on all those other loser languages out there .
All of 'em .
It 's why no better languages have managed to supplant Java yet .
Even if the language and its libraries are ( on the whole ) better than Java's , they also have to contend with the Java platform , and so far nobody 's been able to touch it , unless maybe it 's .NET , but who cares about .
NET ?
Certainly not Amazon.com or Yahoo ! or Google or any other important companies that I 'm aware of .
Anyway , Java 's biggest failing , I 've decided , is its lack of syntax for literal data objects .
It 's an umbrella failing that accounts for most of the issues I have with the language .
The idea behind literals is that you have some sort of serialized notation for your data type , and it 's part of the language syntax , so you can embed pre-initialized objects in your code .
The most obvious ones are numbers , booleans and strings .
It 's hard to imagine life without support for numeric literals , is n't it ?
Well , Java 's support is limited at best .
There 's no syntax for entering a binary value , for instance , like " 0b10010100 " .
And there 's no BigInteger / BigDecimal syntax , so working with them is a disaster and nobody does it if they can help it .
Heck , Java does n't even have unsigned ints and longs .
But Java does more or less the bare minimum for numbers , so people do n't notice it much .
Imagine if there were no String literals , so that instead of this : you had to do this :
Not only is the latter bloated and ugly and error - prone ( can you spot the error in mine ? ) , it 's also butt - slow .
Literals provide the compiler with opportunities for optimization .
Well , unfortunately this OOP garbage is exactly what you have to do when you 're initializing a hashtable in Java .
Nearly all other languages these days have support for hashtable / hashmap literals , something like : That 's the syntax used by Python and JavaScript , but other languages are similar .
The Java equivalent is this :
It might not look that much worse from this simple example , but there are definitely problems .
One is optimization ; the compiler is unlikely to be able to optimize all these method calls , whereas with a literal syntax , it could potentially save on method call overhead during construction of the table ( and maybe other savings as well . )
Another is nested data structures .
In JavaScript ( and Python , Ruby , etc. ) you just declare them in a nested fashion , like so :
It would be hard to do this particular one in Java 5 because of the mixed value types , though it 's probably not an issue since using mixed - type data structures is something you rarely do in practice , even in dynamically - typed languages .
But even if all the values were hashes of string - to - string , how are you going to do it in Java without literals ?
You can't .
You 're stuck with :
And then you find out later that your cleveroptimization ( instead of creating a new HashMap object for each value ) busted it completely .
Whee .
Java programmers wind up dealing with this kind of thing by writing generic helper functions , and it winds up layering even more OOP overhead onto something that ought to be a simple declaration .
It also tends to be brutally slow ; e.g. you could write a function called buildHashMap that took an array of {key , value , key , value , ...} , but it adds a huge constant - factor overhead .
This is why Java programmers rely on XML so heavily , and it imposes both an impedance mismatch ( XML is not Java , so you have to translate back and forth ) and a performance penalty .
But the story does n't end there .
What about Vector / ArrayList literals ?
Java has primitive array literals , which is nice as far as it goes :
Unfortunately , Java 's primitive arrays are a huge wart ; they do n't have methods , can't be subclassed , and basically fall entirely outside the supposedly beautiful OOP - land that Java has created .
It was for performance , to help capture skeptical C++ programmers , and they have their place .
But I do n't see why they should have all the syntactic support .
I mean , the [ ] array - indexing operator is ONLY available for Java arrays .
Sure would be nice to have it for ArrayLists , would n't it ?
And Strings ?
And FileInputStreams ?
But for some reason , Java gave arrays not one , but TWO syntactic sugarings , and then did n't give that sugar to anything else array - like in the language .
So for building ArrayLists , LinkedLists , TreeMaps and the like , you 're stuck with Swing - style code assemblages .
I think of them as Swing - style because I used to do a lot of AWT and Swing programming , back when I was a Thick Client kind of guy , and they have a distinct ( ly unpleasant ) footprint .
It looks vaguely like this , in pseudo - Swing : Building UIs in Swing is this huge , festering gob of object instantiations and method calls .
It 's OOP at its absolute worst .
So people have come up with minilanguages ( like the TableLayout ) , and declarative XML replacements like Apache Jelly , and other ways to try to ease the pain .
I was on a team at Amazon many years ago that was planning to port a big internal Swing application to the web , and we were looking at the various ways to do web programming , which at the time ( for Java ) were pretty much limited to JSP , WebMacro , and rolling your own Swing - like HTML component library .
We experimented with the OOP approach to HTML generation and quickly discarded it as unmaintainable .
( Tell that to any OOP fanatic and watch their face contort as they try to reconcile their conflicting ideas about what constitutes good programming practice . )
The right solution in this case is , of course , a Lisp dialect ; Lisp really shines at this sort of thing .
But Lisp is n't so hot at algebraic expressions , and the best Lisp machines no longer look so cutting - edge compared to the JVM , and blah blah blah , so people do n't use Lisp .
So it goes .
The next - best solutions are all about equally bad .
You have your XML - language approaches ( like Jelly , but for the web ) , but they do n't give you sufficient expressiveness for control flow -- presentation logic really does require code , and it gets ugly in XML in a real hurry .
You have your JSP - style templating approaches , and they are n't bad , but they can have as many as 4 or 5 different languages mixed in the same source file , which presents various problems for your tools ( both the IDEs and the batch tools ) .
And then you have a long tail of other approaches , none of which manage to be very satisfying , but that 's not really the fault of the languages .
It 's the browsers ' fault : they START with three languages ( HTML , CSS , and JavaScript ) , rather than having just one language to control the entire presentation , and it only goes downhill from there .
But NONE of the approaches to web templating is as bad as Swing - style programming , with a huge thicket of calls to new ( ) , addChild ( ) , setAttribute ( ) , addListener ( ) , and the like .
The only approach that 's worse ( and even it might just be tied ) is raw HTML printing :
So we 're all in agreement .
OOP - style assembly of parents and children is the worst way to generate HTML .
You want to use declarations ; you want a template , something that visually looks like the end result you 're trying to create .
Well , it 's the exact same situation for data structures , is n't it ?
You 'd rather draw a picture of it ( in a sense , that 's exactly what you 're doing with syntax for literals ) than write a bunch of code to assemble it .
This is all assuming that you 're working with a small data set , of course .
But that happens all the time in real - world programs ; it 's ubiquitous .
So you kinda want your language to support it syntactically .
And so far we 've only covered literal syntax for HashMaps and ArrayLists ( which you can combine to produce various kinds of custom Trees . )
Already Java's way behind other languages , and we have n't discussed any richer data types .
Like , say , objects .
JavaScript does it the best here , IMO , in the parity between hashes and objects .
It 's not really possible in Ruby or Python to declare a class , then create instances of the class using literal notation the way you can in JavaScript , where the keys are the names of instance variables .
Fortunately you can accomplish this in either Ruby or Python with just a smidge of metaprogramming , so it 's spilt milk at worst .
In Java , you only have one big hammer ( instantiation ) , and one big wrench ( the method call ) , so that 's what you use .
All you can really do to help is create a constructor that takes arguments that populate the instance variables .
But if any of your instance variables are collections ( other than arrays ) , then you 're back to the old create - setprops - addchild , create - setprops - addchild pattern again .
And what about functions ?
Ruby and JavaScript and Lisp and Scheme and Lua and Haskell and OCaml and most other self - respecting languages have function literals .
That is , they have a syntax for declaring an instance of a function as a data object in your code that you can assign to a variable , or pass as a parameter .
( Python has them too , but unfortunately they can only be one line , so Python folks prefer to pretend anonymous functions are n't very important .
This is one of the 10 or so big problems caused by Python 's whitespace policy .
Do n't ever let 'em tell you it does n't cause problems .
It does .
Maybe it 's worth the trade - off ; that 's a personal style preference , but they should at least admit the tradeoff exists . )
Well , Java sort of has them , but Java 's static type system does n't have a literal syntax for a method signature .
It 's pretty easy to imagine one , e.g. something like :
This imaginary syntax declares a variablethat takes 2 ints as parameters and returns a string .
Lots of languages have signature - syntax of some sort , and Java 's syntax space is definitely sparse enough that they could pick a good syntax for it without fear of collisions , even conceptual collisions .
But no such luck .
Instead , when you want to do this sort of thing you have to declare a named interface , and then inside of it declare at least one named method ( which is where the params and return type show up ) , and then you 're still not done , because when you create the function you have to create an anonymous ( or named ) class that contains the definition of the function that matches the interface .
Yuck .
But at least they let you do it ; the alternative of not having it at all is definitely worse .
Still ... is n't syntactic sugar nice ?
I mean , they added the " smart " for - loop , which Java programmers just rave about .
So someone , somewhere in the Java community thinks syntax is good .
I 'm not sure many of them really understand the difference between syntactic sugar ( into which category the " smart " for - loop falls ) and orthogonal syntax , in which the basic operators apply to all data types for which those operators make sense , and there are literal declarations possible for every data type .
Let alone the next step , which is extensible syntax -- but that idea strikes fear into the hearts of many otherwise brave Java programmers , and Rubyists and Pythonistas as well , so let 's back it up a notch to " orthogonal " , and keep everyone calm .
So there you have it : Java 's biggest failing .
It 's the literals .
No literal syntax for array - lists ( or linked lists or tree sets ) , nothing for hashtables , nothing for objects of classes you 've personally defined , none for functions or function signatures .
Java programmers all around the world spend a * lot* of their time working around the problem , using XML and YAML and JSON and other non-Java data - declaration languages , and writing tons of code ( whole frameworks , even ) for serializing and deserializing these declarations to and from Java .
For the smaller stuff , they just write helper functions , which wind up being bloated , inefficient , error - prone , and extremely unsatisfying .
Java 's next - biggest failing may well be the lack of orthogonality in its set of operators .
We can live without operator overloading , I suppose ( the simplest form of extensible syntax ) , but only if Sun makes operators like [ ] and + actually work for objects other than arrays and Strings , respectively .
Jeez .
You can draw your own conclusions about why suddenly there are all these books on Ruby appearing on the bookshelves .
It 's a mix of truths , no doubt .
And you can draw your own conclusions about why Sun 's adding support for scripting languages to the JVM , rather than simply fixing Java so that people do n't want ( need , really ) to use those other languages .
But when you dig down into a programming language , and you get past all the hype and the hooplah , what you find is a set of policies and decisions that affect your everyday life as a programmer in ways you can't ignore , and that no amount of hype will smooth over .
If your language is sitting on you like an invisible elephant , and everyone using the language is struggling to work around the same problems , then it 's inevitable that other languages will come into play .
Libraries can make you more productive , but they have almost no effect on the scalability of the language .
Every language has a complexity ceiling , and it 's determined by a whole slew of policy and design decisions within the language , not the libraries .
The slew includes the type system ( with its attendant hundreds of mini-policies ) , and the syntax , and it also includes the language 's consistency : the ratio of rules to exceptions .
Java 's demonstrating quite clearly that at a certain level of complexity , the libraries and frameworks start to collapse under their own weight .
People are always writing " lightweight " replacements for existing fat Java libraries and frameworks , and then the replacements get replaced , ad infinitum .
But have you ever seen anyone write a replacement for XPath ?
Nope .
It 's not like everyone is rushing out to write the next big XML - querying framework .
This is because XPath is a language , not a library , and it 's orders of magnitude more conceptually scalable than the equivalent DOM manipulations .
Object - Oriented Programming .
Touted even by skeptics as a radical leap forward in productivity , and all OOP really is boils down to a set of organizational techniques .
Organization is nice , sure .
But it 's pretty clear that OOP alone does n't cut it ; it has to be supplemented with Language - Oriented Programming and DSLs .
And all languages , DSLs and general - purpose languages alike , have to be designed to maximize consistency ; each inconsistency and special - case in the language adds to its conceptual overhead and lowers the complexity ceiling .
So you can look at the shelves filling up with Ruby books and chalk it up to marketing hype , but I have a different theory .
I think it 's entirely due to complexity management :
Ruby does a better job of helping managing complexity than its competitors .
It does n't do a perfect job , mind you -- far from it .
But it 's enough of a step forward in productivity ( even over Perl and Python ) that it 's managing to shoulder its way in to a pretty crowded language space .
With that in mind , despite my griping about Java 's failings , I think Sun might actually be doing the right thing by introducing scripting languages ( and improving support for them in the JVM .
) Maybe .
Their investment is n't really so much in Java as it is in the JVM ; the JVM is their .
NET .
Java's not really about productivity , not really -- it 's got a lot of strengths ( performance , deployment , reliability , static checkability , and so on ) , but productivity is n't high on the list .
So maybe the best way to address the productivity issue , for folks who really need it more than raw performance , is to introduce new JVM languages rather than try to pull Java in two directions .
We 'll see .
And with that , I think I 've officially un - blocked myself ; I seem to be able to blog again .
So I 'm declaring the Blogger 's Block series finished !
New Ruby programmers often ask , " What , exactly , is a symbol ?
And how does it differ from a string ? "
No one answer works for everybody , so — with apologies to Wallace Stevens — here are 13 ways of looking at a Ruby symbol .
A Ruby symbol is :
1. A Ruby symbol is the name of something , not just a blob of text
In Ruby , we would generally use symbols when referring to things by name :
find_speech ( :gettysburg_address )
But to represent large chunks of text , we would use strings :
" Four score and seven years ago ... "
2. A Ruby symbol is a label in a free - form enumeration
In C++ ( and many other languages ) , we can use " enumerations " to represent families of related constants :
enum BugStatus { OPEN , CLOSED } ; BugStatus original_status = OPEN ; BugStatus current_status = CLOSED ;
But because Ruby is a dynamic language , we do n't worry about declaring a BugStatus type , or keeping track of the legal values .
Instead , we represent the enumeration values as symbols :
original_status = :open current_status = : closed
3. A Ruby symbol is a constant , unique name
In Ruby , we can change the contents of a string :
" foo " [ 0 ] = ?b # " boo "
But we can't change the contents of a symbol :
: foo [ 0 ] = ?b # Raises an error
Similarly , we can have two different strings with the same contents :
# Same string contents , different strings .
" open " . object_id != " open " .
object_id
But two symbols with the same name are always the same underlying object :
# Same symbol name , same object .
: open .
object_id == : open .
object_id
4. A Ruby symbol is an " interned " string
In Ruby , we can convert a string to a symbol using intern :
" foo " .
intern # returns : foo
intern maintains a hash table mapping strings to the corresponding symbol .
The first time intern sees a string , it creates a new symbol and stores it the hash table .
The next time intern sees a string , it retrieves the original object .
We could implement our own version of Symbol and intern as follows :
class MySymbol TABLE = {} def initialize ( str ) @str = str end def to_s ( ) @str end def == ( other ) self .
object_id == other .
object_id end end class
String def my_intern table = MySymbol :: TABLE unless table .
has_key ? ( self ) table [ self ] = MySymbol . new ( self ) end table [ self ] end end " foo " .
my_intern
5. A Ruby symbol is an object with O ( 1 ) comparison
To compare two strings , we potentially need to look at every character .
For two strings of length N , this will require N+1 comparisons ( which computer scientists refer to as " O ( N ) time " ) .
def string_comp str1 , str2 return false if str1 .
length != str2 . length for i in 0 ... str1 . length return false if str1 [ i ] != str2 [ i ] end return true end string_comp " foo " , " foo "
But since every appearance of : foo refers to the same object , we can compare symbols by looking at object IDs .
We can do this with a single comparison ( which computer scientists refer to as " O( 1 ) time " ) .
def symbol_comp sym1 , sym2 sym1 .
object_id == sym2 .
object_id end symbol_comp :foo , : foo
6. A Ruby symbol is a Lisp identifier
The earliest ancestors of Ruby symbols are Lisp symbols .
In Lisp , symbols are used to represent " identifiers " ( variable and function names ) in a parsed program .
Let 's say we have a have a file named double .l containing a single function :
( defun double ( x ) (* x 2 ) )
We can parse this file using read :
( read " double.l " ) ;;
Returns '( defun double ( x ) (* x 2 ) )
This returns a nested list containing the symbols defun , double , * , x ( twice ) and the number 2 .
7. A Ruby symbol is a Ruby identifier
In Ruby , we can look up identifiers ( variable , function and constant names ) while the program is running .
This is typically done using symbols .
class Demo #
The stuff we 'll look up .
DEFAULT = " Hello " def initialize @message = DEFAULT end def say ( ) @message end #
Use symbols to look up identifiers .
def look_up_with_symbols [ Demo .
const_get ( : DEFAULT ) , method ( : say ) , instance_variable_get ( : @message ) ] end end Demo .
new .
look_up_with_symbols
8. A Ruby symbol is the keyword for a keyword argument
When passing keyword arguments to a Ruby function , we specify the keywords using symbols :
# Build a URL for ' bug ' using Rails .
url_for : controller => ' bug ' , :action => ' show ' , : id => bug .
id
9 . A Ruby symbol is an excellent choice for a hash key
Typically , we 'll use symbols to represent the keys of a hash table :
options = {} options [ : auto_save ] = true options [ : show_comments ] = false
10 . A Ruby symbol is like a Mac OSType
The MacOS uses four - character abbreviations to represent open - ended enumerations :
enum { kSystemFolderType = ' macs ' , kDesktopFolderType = ' desk ' , // ... and so on ...
kTrashFolderType = ' trsh ' } ; OSType folder = kSystemFolderType ;
In Ruby , we 'd typically use symbols for the same purpose :
: system_folder :desktop_folder : trash_folder
11 . A Ruby symbol is a memory leak
Because of the way Ruby symbols are stored , they can never be garbage collected .
So if we create 10,000 one - off symbols that we 'll never use again , we 'll never get the memory back .
Some Scheme implementations use a clever version of intern that looks up symbols using a weak hash table .
This allows symbols to be garbage collected without destroying their uniqueness properties .
12 . A Ruby symbol is a clever way to store only a single copy of a string
( For a similar idea , see this article . )
Let 's say we 're working on natural language parser that tries to understand breakfast orders .
We have a corpus of 30,000 sentences that represent real - world breakfast orders , and we 're trying to find the patterns .
But even though we have a huge number of sentences , the actually vocubulary is fairly limited .
We do n't want to store 15,000 copies of the word " bacon " in memory !
Instead , we can use symbols to represent the individual words :
corpus = [ [ :i , : want , : some , : bacon ] , [ :i , : want , : some , :eggs ] , [ : give , :me , : some , : bacon ] , [ : chunky , : bacon ] , # ... 29,995 more phrases ... [ : some , : toast , : please ] ]
In the early days of AI , many Lisp programs used exactly this strategy for representing text .
13 . A Ruby symbol is a C typedef named " ID "
Internally , Ruby 1.8 represents symbols using the type ID .
This is a typedef for an unsigned integer .
An ID represents an entry in Ruby 's symbol table .
typedef unsigned long ID ;
Some interesting symbol - related functions include :
// Enter a C string into symbol table .
ID rb_intern ( const char * name ) ; // Convert an ID to a Symbol object .
# define ID2SYM(x ) // Convert a String to a Symbol object .
VALUE rb_str_intern ( VALUE s ) ;
Other explanations of Ruby symbols
If none of these explanations work for you , you might have luck with one of the following :
You have to wonder what America has done to deserve to be stuck in Korea .
What curse are we suffering under ?
On the one side are the South Koreans , whom we have defended for five decades .
Large numbers think more highly of China and North Korea than of America ; many view the U.S. as the region ’s most dangerous actor .
It should come as no surprise that when President Roh Moo - hyun visits next week , he wo n’t be getting a trip to Graceland .
The Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea is far worse .
The regime of Kim Jong - il is virtually unknowable and follows an internal logic that is indecipherable .
The only certainty in dealing with Pyongyang is that negotiations are never over and another instance of brinkmanship is around the corner .
As a result , Washington finds itself in the middle when the North engages in yet another , inevitable provocation .
For instance , the July 4 North Korean missile tests set off a frenzied reaction not only in Seoul and Tokyo , but Washington , D.C.
Yet why should the most powerful nation on earth , with the largest , most sophisticated nuclear arsenal as well as overwhelming conventional military , be concerned about a backward , impoverished state seeking to develop a new missile ?
Absent America ’s military presence in the South , the DPRK ’s actions would be largely irrelevant .
U.S. contact with Korea goes back more than a century , but it was the 1945 defeat of Japan that brought American troops to the peninsula .
Washington and Moscow set up competing regimes ; only massive U.S. intervention in 1950 saved the Republic of Korea from defeat in a North Korean attempt at blitzkrieg .
Three years later the combatants , which by then included the People ’s Republic of China , signed an armistice halting combat near the original border at the 38th Parallel .
Since then Washington has defended the South , which eventually moved from dictatorship to democracy .
North Korea remains a mysterious totalitarian hellhole , based on a personality cult beyond anything achieved by Mao Zedong or Joseph Stalin .
An impoverished nation of 23 million , the DPRK would be largely irrelevant internationally if it was not busy developing nuclear weapons .
As in Europe , history weighs heavily in Korea upon U.S. military deployments .
Washington intervened in a very different world , which has completely disappeared .
The Cold War is over ; the Soviet Union has collapsed ; Maoist China has disappeared .
North Korea remains hostile , but saw its economy shrink and its population starve in the late 1990s .
Its recovery , such as it is , merely has replaced catastrophe with misery .
On the other side , America ’s once war - ravaged allies , Japan and South Korea , have become prosperous democracies , leading trading nations , and influential global players .
The ROK now has about 40 times the North ’s GDP , as well as twice the population and a vast technological lead .
Starting afresh , no one would think of sending 30,000 U.S. troops to the South .
Suggesting that the ROK can’t defend itself would be about the same as arguing that America required assistance in defending against Mexico .
Even Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld admits : “ I do n’t see [ the North Koreans ] , frankly , as an immediate military threat to South Korea . ”
Some analysts worry that Seoul wo n’t make the effort necessary to defend itself , but that is not America ’s problem .
During the Cold War one might argue that the larger struggle required U.S. Intervention even on behalf of irresponsible allies .
Not today , however : full responsibility for its future should be placed on the ROK .
Although the raison d’être for the Washington - Seoul alliance no longer exists , for some people the means ( a garrison in the South ) has become the end .
Which means finding new justifications for old commitments .
Toward this end some U.S. and South Korean analysts have talked about “ dual use ” deployments .
Seoul wants America to defend against Japan ; Washington wants to use South Korean bases to defend against China .
And everyone talks about preserving regional stability .
Yet Tokyo , despite current tensions with China and the ROK , is n’t about to embark upon a new campaign of aggression .
Military action by Beijing seems almost as unlikely , even in the long - term ; moreover , South Korean officials have made it clear that they wo n’t help form an anti-Chinese front .
There ’s plenty of local instability throughout East Asia even with U.S. forces based in the ROK .
Anyway , there is n’t much American troops could or should do in response to local troubles in the future .
Patrolling , say , one of Indonesia ’s potential breakaway provinces simply is n’t in America ’s interest .
More broadly , U.S. Troops are said to cement U.S. influence or prevent a regional arms race .
However , there ’s no evidence that the garrison in the South adds anything to the influence that comes naturally from being the globe ’s sole superpower .
Nor has America ’s force presence stopped the People ’s Republic of China from upgrading its military ; better that front - line allied states take responsibility for their region ’s security rather than rely on Washington .
While there ’s no obvious benefit for the U.S. in keeping troops in the ROK , there are plenty of costs .
Instead of offering a cheap advanced base for America , the Korean commitment requires an expanded military to meet additional defense contingencies .
Figuring out the exact cost of the Korean deployment is n’t easy , but past estimates ran upwards of $ 15 billion , about as much as Seoul spends on its entire defense .
A promise to defend also increases the risk of involvement in a conflict that no longer matters much for U.S. security .
The ROK was important symbolically during the Cold War ; today any conflict involving it would be a humanitarian tragedy but would have no significant security implications .
The troop presence ensures that any war will involve America ; even the the latest U.S. - ROK maneuvers raised tensions with the North .
Today Washington has to worry about far more pressing conflicts , especially Afghanistan , Iraq , and the continuing fight against al - Qaeda .
Moreover , it is the defense guarantee for and force deployment in South Korea that make the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea America ’s problem .
Absent those ties , the latest machinations of the North ’s exotic dictator , Kim Jong - il , would more amuse than frighten .
Even Pyongyang ’s nuclear program would primarily be an issue for North Korea ’s neighbors .
The U.S. possesses the most powerful military on earth , including the most advanced nuclear force .
Thus , the DPRK could not use nuclear weapons against America without inviting a devastating retaliation .
And all evidence suggests that Kim Jong - il wants his virgins today rather than in paradise .
Washington would still rightly be concerned about proliferation , but Kim could be made to understand that this would be an extraordinarily risky way to make additional cash .
Ironically , the worst proliferator so far has been U.S. ally Pakistan .
If it was n’t entwined in Korean security issues , America would no longer need to take the lead in the ever tortuous and torturous negotiations with the North .
America could offer to support whatever South Korea , Japan , China , and Russia come up with , with the proviso that they should not call on the U.S. for help if they botch the process .
Indeed , Washington also could take that position with regard to North Korean missile tests , conventional deployments , and the like .
The U.S. could do so even if Pyongyang moved ahead with a nuclear test , now viewed as a possibility  though all such estimates must be treated with skepticism .
After the recent DPRK missile tests , a Bush administration aide opined that the U.S. only had an array of “ familiar bad choices . ”
Yet we have to choose among bad options only because we insist on being involved .
At the time of the North Korean launches , the U.S. blustered and threatened even though the DPRK violated no principle of international law and threatened no neighbor .
Grant that it would be better if North Korea did not develop advanced weapons  heck , grant that it would wonderful if Kim Jong - il turned his country into a liberal democracy , dismantled the North Korean gulag , and turned himself over to the Hague for trial for crimes against humanity  it made no sense for America to complain if it was n’t going to do anything in response .
And it made no sense to do anything since Pyongyang ’s action was merely a symbolic attempt at provocation which succeeded only because the U.S .
And its allies got so excited about what was essentially nothing .
In one sense , “ solving ” the Korean problem is incredibly complicated .
South Korea is nationalistic , with younger generations turning against America ; many ROK residents have a strangely rosy view of the North .
The DPRK is ever bellicose and belligerent , committed to a game of inconsistent brinkmanship , a war waiting to happen .
How the expanding South and stagnating North work out their increasingly interconnected futures , and how that affects their neighbors , is anyone ’s guess .
However , it really is easy for America to “ solve ” the Korea problem .
Just get out .
Washington has begun a force drawdown , moving from 37,000 to just under 30,000 troops , and is preparing to turn over wartime command to the South .
The U.S. should speedily bring the rest of them home .
Americans should cheerfully sell the ROK whatever weapons it desires , but they should leave up to Seoul how to respond to the garrison ’s departure .
South Korea ’s defense is South Korea ’s problem .
At the same time , the U.S. Should essentially ignore the DPRK .
Once Washington ’s forces were gone , North Korea would be largely irrelevant to American policy .
If Kim Jong - il breathed new threats against the U.S. , Washington should politely remind him about its nuclear deterrent .
Otherwise , it should offer no comment on the latest North Korean provocation and point to the ROK if he came calling for aid .
After a decent interval  and during a time of relatively “ good ” DPRK behavior  the U.S. Should offer to open discussions on establishing diplomatic relations .
It would be a minor concession , providing Washington with at least a little window into the North , and Pyongyang with a reward of sorts for behaving more like a normal country .
The U.S. Should indicate a willingness to engage in more substantive discussions so long as the DPRK makes a positive contribution to the larger security environment .
While stepping back the U.S. Should emphasize to North Korea ’s neighbors that they now bear primary responsibility for ensuring regional stability .
The South must realistically assess the threat posed by the DPRK , since the U.S. would not be defending Seoul .
China should seriously ponder the prospect of a nuclear North , since the ROK and Japan ( and even Taiwan ) might follow suit .
Japan needs to realistically balance domestic political concerns over accounting for Japanese abducted by Pyongyang with international geopolitical concerns over moderating North Korean behavior .
How well these nations would perform obviously is impossible to predict , but they all have a greater incentive to get policy right  after all , the DPRK is spoiling their neighborhood , not North America .
At the same time , they have greater insight , however limited , into the modern “ Hermit Kingdom . ”
South Korea shares culture and history , China is a long - time ally , and Japan was a one - time colonial overlord .
At least they have a better chance of getting it right than does Washington .
The U.S. has global interests , but that does n’t mean it must micromanage the affairs of every region and must manipulate the details of every potential conflict .
North Korea is an unsettling actor in Northeast Asia , but it is most threatening to its neighbors .
More than five decades after the end of the Korean War , three decades after the new opening with China , and nearly two decades after the end of the Cold War , the U.S. can disengage from the Korean peninsula .
The ROK neither needs nor warrants American protection .
Pyongyang neither requires nor deserves American attention .
Washington should spend its time and resources addressing more important and more pressing issues elsewhere in the world .
The succinct version of the actuarial viewpoint on limits to the healthy human life span is as follows :
limits to life span presently exist
these limits are increasing at a modest rate , something like 1 year every 5 years
there appears to be no ceiling to life span in the future
This viewpoint is derived from an examination of mortality rates in various population groups over time , but still comes to the same answer as a consideration of the operation of our biology from first principles , such as the reliability theory of aging and longevity .
Our bodies are enormously complex machines and , like all machines , the life span and failure rates are determined by the degree and capabilities of maintenance .
So : more knowledge , better medicine and better biotechnology means longer , healthier lives .
This will happen slowly as a matter of course , since better medicine reduces the rate at which damage accumulates over a lifetime .
It could happen much faster if we put our minds to it and there was a much greater level of support for moving directly and deliberately to extend healthy life span by the most efficient means possible .
Here is the abstract for another recently published paper giving support to the actuarial viewpoint outlined above ; hopefully you recall a little of statistics lessons from past years .
If not , then skip to the last line and the explanation below :
Increase in common longevity and the compression of mortality :
The case of Japan
This study shows a strong increase in the modal age at death ( M ) in Japan over a period of 50 calendar years , accompanied by a clear decrease in the standard deviation of ages at death above M ( SD ( M+ ) ) until the 1990s for men and the mid-1980s for women .
For the most recent periods SD ( M+ ) appears to have stopped decreasing , even though M has continued to increase linearly .
This stagnation in SD ( M+ ) has been accompanied by stagnation in q ( M ) .
The number of deaths at M ( d ( M ) ) and the number of deaths at and above M ( d( M+ ) ) have increased , but significantly more slowly since the period 1975 - 79 .
Since the 1980s an acceleration in the increase of M+kSD ( M+ ) , our indicator of the longest life durations , has been essentially due to the pause in SD ( M + ) .
Our data do not suggest that we are approaching an upper limit in human longevity .
Translated for those of us far past our school days : the most common age of death is increasing with no signs of slowing down .
If there was a compression of mortality - in other words , if medicine was only succeeding in pushing all our life spans ever closer up to some absolute limit - then we would see the distribution of ages at death compressed down into a smaller span of years .
However , this distribution of age of death for the longest lived people continues to expand ahead in years .
Compression of mortality is not what we are seeing here , but rather something much more like the scenario of better maintenance leading to longer - lasting machinery .
This bodes well for the future , should we get our act together and push harder for the development of better medicine aimed at the repair of damage that causes aging .
Technorati tags : aging , statistics
In reading the reports of the trial of the Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk , you are struck by two things .
The first of course is the anachronistic brutality of the country 's laws .
Mr Pamuk , like scores of other writers and journalists , is being prosecuted for " denigrating Turkishness " , which means that he dared to mention the Armenian genocide in the first world war and the killing of the Kurds in the past decade .
The second is its staggering , blithering stupidity .
If there is one course of action which could be calculated to turn these massacres into live issues , it is the trial of the country 's foremost novelist for mentioning them .
As it prepares for accession , the Turkish government will discover that the other members of the European Union have found a more effective means of suppression .
Without legal coercion , without the use of baying mobs to drive writers from their homes , we have developed an almost infinite capacity to forget our own atrocities .
Atrocities ?
Which atrocities ?
When a Turkish writer uses that word , everyone in Turkey knows what he is talking about , even if they deny it vehemently .
But most British people will stare at you blankly .
So let me give you two examples , both of which are as well documented as the Armenian genocide .
In his book Late Victorian Holocausts , published in 2001 , Mike Davis tells the story of the famines which killed between 12 and 29 million Indians { 1} .
These people were , he demonstrates , murdered by British state policy .
When an El Nino drought destituted the farmers of the Deccan plateau in 1876 there was a net surplus of rice and wheat in India .
But the viceroy , Lord Lytton , insisted that nothing should prevent its export to England .
In 1877 and 1878 , at height of the famine , grain merchants exported a record 6.4 million hundredweight of wheat .
As the peasants began to starve , government officials were ordered " to discourage relief works in every possible way " { 2} .
The Anti-Charitable Contributions
Act of 1877 prohibited " at the pain of imprisonment private relief donations that potentially interfered with the market fixing of grain prices " .
The only relief permitted in most districts was hard labour , from which anyone in an advanced state of starvation was turned away .
Within the labour camps , the workers were given less food than the inmates of Buchenwald .
In 1877 , monthly mortality in the camps equated to an annual death rate of 94 % .
As millions died , the imperial government launched " a militarized campaign to collect the tax arrears accumulated during the drought " .
The money , which ruined those who might otherwise have survived the famine , was used by Lytton to fund his war in Afghanistan .
Even in places which had produced a crop surplus , the government 's export policies , like Stalin's in the Ukraine , manufactured hunger .
In the North - western provinces , Oud and the Punjab , which had brought in record harvests in the preceding three years , at least 1.25 million died .
Three recent books - Britain 's Gulag by Caroline Elkins , Histories of the Hanged by David Anderson and Web of Deceit by Mark Curtis - show how white settlers and British troops suppressed the Mau Mau revolt in Kenya in the 1950s .
Thrown off their best land and deprived of political rights , the Kikuyu started to organise - some of them violently - against colonial rule .
The British responded by driving up to 320,000 of them into concentration camps { 3} .
Most of the remainder - over a million - were held in " enclosed villages " .
Prisoners were questioned with the help of " slicing off ears , boring holes in eardrums , flogging until death , pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight , and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes " .
{ 4 } British soldiers used a " metal castrating instrument " to cut off testicles and fingers .
" By the time I cut his balls off " , one settler boasted , " he had no ears , and his eyeball , the right one , I think , was hanging out of its socket " { 5} .
The soldiers were told they could shoot anyone they liked " provided they were black " { 6} .
Elkins 's evidence suggests that over 100,000 Kikuyu were either killed by the British or died of disease and starvation in the camps .
David Anderson documents the hanging of 1090 suspected rebels : far more than the French executed in Algeria { 7} .
Thousands more were summarily executed by soldiers , who claimed they had " failed to halt " when challenged .
These are just two examples of at least twenty such atrocities overseen and organised by the British government or British colonial settlers : they include , for example , the Tasmanian genocide , the use of collective punishment in Malaya , the bombing of villages in Oman , the dirty war in North Yemen , the evacuation of Diego Garcia .
Some of them might trigger a vague , brainstem memory in a few thousand readers , but most people would have no idea what I 'm talking about .
Max Hastings , in the Guardian today , laments our " relative lack of interest in Stalin and Mao's crimes " . { 8 }
But at least we are aware that they happened .
In the Express we can read the historian Andrew Roberts arguing that for " the vast majority of its half millennium - long history , the British Empire was an exemplary force for good ... the British gave up their Empire largely without bloodshed , after having tried to educate their successor governments in the ways of democracy and representative institutions " { 9} ( presumably by locking up their future leaders ) .
In the Sunday Telegraph , he insists that " the British empire delivered astonishing growth rates , at least in those places fortunate enough to be coloured pink on the globe " .
{ 10 } ( Compare this to Mike Davis 's central finding , that " there was no increase in India 's per capita income from 1757 to 1947 " , or to Prasannan Parthasarathi's demonstration that " South Indian labourers had higher earnings than their British counterparts in the 18th century and lived lives of greater financial security " . { 11} )
In the Daily Telegraph , John Keegan asserts that " the empire became in its last years highly benevolent and moralistic " .
The Victorians " set out to bring civilisation and good government to their colonies and to leave when they were no longer welcome .
In almost every country , once coloured red on the map , they stuck to their resolve . " { 12} There is one , rightly sacred Holocaust in European history .
All the others can be ignored , denied or belittled .
As Mark Curtis points out , the dominant system of thought in Britain " promotes one key concept that underpins everything else - the idea of Britain 's basic benevolence ...
Criticism of foreign policies is certainly possible , and normal , but within narrow limits which show " exceptions " to , or " mistakes " in , promoting the rule of basic benevolence " . { 13 }
This idea , I fear , is the true " sense of British cultural identity " whose alleged loss Max laments today .
No judge or censor is required to enforce it .
The men who own the papers simply commission the stories they want to read .
Turkey 's accession to the European Union , now jeopardised by the trial of Orhan Pamuk , requires not that it comes to terms with its atrocities ; only that it permits its writers to rage impotently against them .
If the government wants the genocide of the Armenians to be forgotten , it should drop its censorship laws and let people say what they want .
It needs only allow Richard Desmond and the Barclay brothers to buy up its newspapers , and the past will never trouble it again .

Often a change in character is a crucial part of shifting your identity to become more congruent with your goals and intentions .
For example , suppose you want to become more successful in your career , and you set a goal to reach a certain position .
Maybe the main reason you have n’t yet reached that position is that your character attributes are out of sync with it .
Perhaps you are n’t disciplined enough , confident enough , or resourceful enough to get there .
Once you can identify the character qualities you ’re missing , you can consciously develop them .
But as long as you remain in the dark about these deficiencies , it will be tough to reach your goal because you wo n’t yet be the kind of person who can achieve it .
It ’s like trying to lift more weight than your muscles can manage .
Select one of your goals or intentions , especially one where your progress has been disappointing .
Now ask yourself if a person with different character attributes would be more capable of achieving this goal than you are .
What kind of person would find your goal easy to achieve ?
Ask yourself the following questions :
What would a person with more self - esteem do in my situation ?
What would a person with more courage do in my situation ?
What would a person with more self - discipline do in my situation ?
What would a person with more confidence do in my situation ?
What would a person with more compassion do in my situation ?
What would a person with more gratitude do in my situation ?
What would a person with more centeredness do in my situation ?
What would a person with more flexibility do in my situation ?
What would a person with more curiosity do in my situation ?
What would a person with more resourcefulness do in my situation ?
What would a person with more wisdom do in my situation ?
Feel free to scan this list of values for more ideas .
By asking these questions for each of your goals , you ’ll end up with a list of character qualities to develop .
By strengthening these qualities , you ’ll become the kind of person who can and will achieve your goal .
Almost any meaningful goal you set will require some kind of character development .
In the long run this character building is one of the best side effects of pursuing goals , eventually outshadowing the goals themselves .
Just as weight training makes you stronger , goal achievement builds you a stronger character .
For example , if I can see that my problems would n’t even be an issue for someone with more courage , then I know a lack of courage is what ’s holding me back .
Complaining that the problem is too difficult does n’t help me — that gives me nothing to work with .
But realizing that I can solve the problem if I develop my courage is helpful because it gives me a direction .
I know that if I can build my courage level high enough , I can eventually achieve the goal .
Once you ’ve identified the character attributes you need to build , how do you train them up ?
See the article on Progressive Training for details on how to accomplish that .
The process is very similar to using weight training to build your muscles .
You start where you are and grow by tackling a series of progressive challenges .
You can also find a couple processes specifically for building courage in the article The Courage to Live Consciously .
Any character building you accomplish now can serve you well indefinitely .
Qualities like courage , self - discipline , and resourcefulness pay dividends across all areas of your life .
The effort to help Muslim moderates and democratic reformers , President Bush insists , is a primary bulwark against ethnoreligious conflict and the terrorism it breeds .
Yet , five years into the war on terror , real - world examples to support that contention are scarce .
There is , however , a conflict zone that has developed a strong model of stifling violent extremism – one that could be replicated in hot spots around the world : Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula .
Last month in picturesque Crimea , minority Muslim Tatars clashed violently with ethnic Russians who make up the majority of the region 's population .
This was the worst in a string of incendiary events that began in August 2006 : pro-Moscow paramilitary gangs assaulted Tatars at their holiest site , a building housing their parliament was bombed , and a Tatar journalist was assassinated .
Meanwhile , foreign - sponsored Wahhabi Muslim extremist groups appeared on the scene , urging violent retaliation .
Most anywhere else in the world , this would have been the trigger for a major ethnoreligious war .
But thanks to the Tatars ' locally developed democracy , their leadership was able to avert full - scale hostilities .
The Tatars of Crimea were victims of ethnic cleansing and deportation policies under Russian czars and later under Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union .
In 1944 , Stalin deported all Tatars to Uzbekistan and other parts of Central Asia .
Throughout their exile , Tatars maintained a strong national identity , and , post - Stalin , they formed a celebrated nonviolent resistance movement .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , Crimea became an autonomous republic in Ukraine , and the resistance movement collaborated with the newly independent Ukrainian government to secure Tatars ' right of return .
However , Crimea continues to be dominated by its Russian majority and a pro-Moscow party .
The new repatriates faced oppression as ethnic Russian authorities in Crimea prevented the restitution of land and job opportunities .
Rather than be marginalized , the Tatar leadership 's unique solution was the 1991 creation of the Mejlis , or " assembly " system , to establish their legitimacy in the Ukrainian political milieu .
Leaders adopted the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights as their political model , with democracy and nonviolence as guiding doctrines .
Early on , Mejlis members appealed to the UN and the international community for recognition of their rights , which has resulted in close working ties between the Mejlis and various international aid organizations .
The Mejlis was eventually recognized as a legitimate political player by Ukraine 's government .
Mustafa Jemilev , the father of the resistance movement , now holds a seat in the Ukrainian parliament .
Indeed , he is part of the Orange bloc coalition , which has been a symbol for democracy in the region and worldwide .
An elected religious institution , the Muftiyat , was established alongside the Mejlis system to prevent the inpouring of religious extremism and preserve Tatar Islamic folk traditions .
Amid the ethnic tensions , small - scale Wahhabist groups sponsored by Arab Gulf states have emerged , including the banned Hizb - i - Tehrir , which castigated the Mejlis for its " soft " policies .
But the Muftiyat , allied with the Mejlis , denounced these ideologies as " false teachings and objectives rejected by Islam , " and swiftly silenced the radicals with popular tolerance and education campaigns at local mosques .
The overwhelming success of the Mejlis in preventing the spread of violence rests on its exclusive reliance on negotiations , international support , and nonviolent public protests .
When Tatar rights are denied or provocation occurs , Mejlis leaders step in to mediate .
And the Mejlis actively preventsthe formation of independent militias , recognizing their detriment to any negotiation process .
Despite many roadblocks , peaceful Tatar activism has achieved what was previously inconceivable : repatriation and citizenship for 250,000 Tatars , quasi- recognition of the Mejlis by the central government , and seats within Ukrainian and Crimean legislatures .
The Crimean Tatar experience proves that there is indeed a nonviolent prophylactic for ethnoreligious conflict .
Giving official recognition to the political aspirations of indigenous minorities helps address popular grievances through peaceful negotiation instead of street violence .
That 's the lesson of the Mejlis and Muftiyat in Crimea .
And it 's the lesson that should be applied to other conflict zones , from Muslim minority populations across the former Soviet Union , to the Kurds in Syria and the Moros in the Philippines .
Fostering local participatory movements is n't just about keeping democracy healthy .
In the global war on terror , it 's one of the best defenses against transnational fundamentalism .
• Waleed Ziad , an economic consultant and a principal at the Truman National Security Project , writes extensively on Islamic fundamentalist movements .
Laryssa Chomiak , a Department of Homeland Security fellow , covered the Crimean Tatar minority for the University of Maryland 's Minorities at Risk Project .
They recently returned from Crimea , where they interviewed Tatar leaders .
The Gauss Rifle :
A Magnetic Linear Accelerator
This very simple toy uses a magnetic chain reaction to launch a steel marble at a target at high speed .
The toy is very simple to build , going together in minutes , and is very simple to understand and explain , and yet fascinating to watch and to use .
Click on image for animated view
The photo above shows six frames of video showing the gauss rifle in action .
Each frame shows 1/30th of a second .
In the first frame , a steel ball starts rolling towards a magnet taped to a wooden ruler .
In the second frame , a second ball can be seen speeding between the rightmost two magnets .
By the third frame , the accelerator has sped up so much that the ball that is seen leaving the left side of the device is just a blur as it smashes into the target .
One ball , starting at rest , has caused another ball to leave the device at a very high speed .
Click on image for larger view
The materials are simple .
We need a wooden ruler that has a groove in the top in which a steel ball can roll easily .
Any piece of wood or aluminum or brass with a groove will work .
We chose the ruler because they are easy to find around the house or at school or at a local stationery store .
We need some sticky tape .
Again , almost any kind will do .
Here we use Scotch brand transparent tape , but vinyl electrical tape works just as well .
We need four magnets .
Most any type will do , but the stronger the magnets are , the faster the balls will go .
Here we use the super strong gold - plated neodymium - iron - boron magnets we have made available in our catalog for the other projects .
They work great .
We will also need nine steel balls , with a diameter that is a close match to the height of the magnets .
We use 5/8 inch diameter nickel plated steel balls from our catalog
The only tool we will need is a sharp knife for trimming the tape .
Click on image for larger view
We start by taping the first magnet to the ruler at the 2.5 inch mark .
The distance is somewhat arbitrary -- we wanted to get all four magnets on a one foot ruler .
Feel free to experiment with the spacing later .
Click on image for larger view
With the sharp knife , trim off any excess tape .
Be careful , since the knife will be strongly attracted to the magnet .
It isthat you keep the magnets from jumping together .
They are made of a brittle sintered material that shatters like a ceramic .
Tape the ruler to the table temporarily , so that it does n't jump up to the next magnet as you tape the second magnet to the ruler .
Click on image for larger view
Continue taping the magnets to the ruler , leaving 2.5 inches between the magnets .
When all four magnets are taped to the ruler , it is time to load the gauss rifle with the balls .
Click on image for larger view
To the right of each magnet , place two steel balls .
Arrange a target to the right of the device , so the ball does not roll down the street and get lost .
To fire the gauss rifle , set a steel ball in the groove to the left of the leftmost magnet .
Let the ball go .
If it is close enough to the magnet , it will start rolling by itself , and hit the magnet .
Click on image for larger view
When the gauss rifle fires , it will happen too fast to see .
The ball on the right will shoot away from the gun , and hit the target with considerable force .
Our one foot long version is designed so the speed is not enough to hurt someone , and you can use your hand or foot as a target .
How does it do that ?
When you release the first ball , it is attracted to the first magnet .
It hits the magnet with a respectable amount of force , and a kinetic energy we will call " 1 unit " .
The kinetic energy of the ball is transfered to the magnet , and then to the ball that is touching it on the right , and then to the ball that is touching that one .
This transfer of kinetic energy is familiar to billiards players -- when the cue ball hits another ball , the cue ball stops and the other ball speeds off .
The third ball is now moving with a kinetic energy of 1 unit .
But it is moving towards the second magnet .
It picks up speed as the second magnet pulls it closer .
When it hits the second magnet , it is moving nearly twice as fast as the first ball .
The third ball hits the magnet , and the fifth ball starts to move with a kinetic energy of 2 units .
It speeds up as it nears the third magnet , and hits with of 3 units of kinetic energy .
This causes the seventh ball to speed off towards the last magnet .
As it gets drawn to the last magnet , it speeds up to 4 units of kinetic energy .
The kinetic energy is now transfered to the last ball , which speeds off at 4 units , to hit the target .
Another way of looking at the mechanism
When the device is all set up and ready to be triggered , we can see that there are four balls that are touching their magnets .
These balls are at what physicists call the " ground state " .
It takes energy to move them away from the magnets .
But each of these balls has another ball touching it .
These second balls are not at the ground state .
They are each 5/8ths of an inch from a magnet .
They are easier to move than the balls that are touching the magnet .
If we were to take a ball that was touching a magnet , and pull it away from the magnet until it was 5/8 ths of an inch away , we would be adding energy to the ball .
The ball would be pulling towards the magnet with some considerable force .
We could get the energy back by letting the ball go .
After the gauss rifle has fired , the situation is different .
Now each of the balls is touching a magnet .
There is one ball on each side of each magnet .
Each ball is in its ground state , and has given up the energy that was stored by being 5/8 ths of an inch from a magnet .
That energy has gone into the last ball , which uses it to destroy the target .
Speed and kinetic energy
The kinetic energy of an object is defined as half its mass times the square of its velocity .
As each magnet pulls on a ball , it adds kinetic energy to the ball linearly .
But the speed does not add up linearly .
If we have 4 magnets , the kinetic energy is 4 , but the speed goes up as the square root of the kinetic energy .
As we add more magnets , the speed goes up by a smaller amount each time .
But the distance the ball will roll , and the damage it causes to what it hits , is a function of the kinetic energy , and thus a function of how many magnets we use .
We can keep scaling up the gun until the kinetic energy gets so high that the last magnet is shattered by the impact .
After that , adding more magnets will not do much good .
Why a circular track will not be a perpetual motion device
I have been getting a lot of mail asking what would happen if we made the track circular .
Would we get free energy ?
Would the balls keep accelerating forever ?
I have been tempted to reply with the famous quote : " There are two kinds of people in the world -- those who understand the second law of thermodynamics , and those who do n't " .
However , I am not the kind of person to leave an inquiring mind unsatisfied , and it is more productive ( and kind ) to explain in a little more depth what is going on .
Suppose you made a circular track , and put two balls after each magnet .
When the last ball is released , it encounters a magnet that has two balls at the ground state .
There is no energy to be had from this magnet .
The ball just bounces back .
Now suppose you had placed three balls after each magnet .
When the last ball is released , it hits a ball that is 5/8ths inch from the magnet .
It has not gained much momentum , because most of the momentum gained is in the last half inch as the magnet pulls much stronger on things that are closer .
But the ball has enough energy from previous accelerations to release the next ball .
However , that ball has less energy than the ball that caused it to release .
It may have enough energy to release another ball or two , but each ball that is released has less energy than before , and eventually the chain stops .
You can show by inductive logic that no matter how many balls you stack in front of each magnet , eventually the system stops .
To estimate the losses due to heating the balls as they compress when hit , consider a plastic tube standing upright on a table .
Place one steel ball at the bottom of the tube .
Now drop another ball into the tube , so it hits the ball at the bottom , and bounces back up .
Now measure how high the ball bounced .
If it bounces halfway back up , the losses are 50 % .
Perform the experiment for yourself with the balls from the Gauss Rifle .
How high does your ball bounce ?
Send me mail with your results .

A region of the human brain that scientists believe is critical to human intellectual abilities surprisingly functions much like a digital computer , according to psychology Professor Randall O'Reilly of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
The finding could help researchers better understand the functioning of human intelligence .
In a review of biological computer models of the brain appearing in the Oct. 6 edition of the journal Science , O'Reilly contends that the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia operate much like a digital computer system .
" Many researchers who create these models shun the computer metaphor , " O'Reilly said .
" My work comes out of a tradition that says people 's brains are nothing like computers , and now all of a sudden as we look at them , in fact , in a certain respect they are like computers . "
Digital computers operate by turning electrical signals into binary " on and off states " and flexibly manipulating these states by using switches .
O'Reilly found the same operating principles in the brain .
" The neurons in the prefrontal cortex are binary -- they have two states , either active or inactive -- and the basal ganglia is essentially a big switch that allows you to dynamically turn on and off different parts of the prefrontal cortex , " O'Reilly said .
The brain as a whole operates more like a social network than a digital computer , with neurons communicating to allow learning and the creation of memory , according to O'Reilly .
However , the computer - like features of the prefrontal cortex broaden the social networks , helping the brain become more flexible in processing novel and symbolic information , O'Reilly said .
The prefrontal cortex is the executive center of the brain and supports " higher level " cognition , including decision making and problem solving .
Researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex is critical to human intellectual ability , and better understanding it is crucial to understanding more about human intelligence , according to O'Reilly .
If researchers can gain a better understanding of this synthesis of the prefrontal cortex and the brain as a whole , they could be on the way to a better understanding of human intelligence .
The best way to do this , O'Reilly says , is by developing more biologically based computer models of the brain to help researchers understand how the biology of the brain works , and eventually provide insights into what makes us so smart .
" Modeling the brain is not like a lot of science where you can go from one step to the next in a chain of reasoning , because you need to take into account so many levels of analysis , " O'Reilly said .
O'Reilly likens the process to weather modeling .
" Most weather models do n't exactly represent what happens in a low - pressure system , but they do capture some global features , " he said .
" If you capture the essence of it , it tells you a lot about how the system works .
It 's the same premise when it comes to modeling of the brain . "

The project describes teaching process of multi-layer neural network employing backpropagation algorithm .
To illustrate this process the three layer neural network with two inputs and one output , which is shown in the picture below , is used :
Each neuron is composed of two units .
First unit adds products of weights coefficients and input signals .
The second unit realise nonlinear function , called neuron activation function .
Signal e is adder output signal , and y = f(e ) is output signal of nonlinear element .
Signal y is also output signal of neuron .
To teach the neural network we need training data set .
The training data set consists of input signals ( x 1 and x 2 ) assigned with corresponding target ( desired output ) z .
The network training is an iterative process .
In each iteration weights coefficients of nodes are modified using new data from training data set .
Modification is calculated using algorithm described below : Each teaching step starts with forcing both input signals from training set .
After this stage we can determine output signals values for each neuron in each network layer .
Pictures below illustrate how signal is propagating through the network , Symbols w ( xm ) n represent weights of connections between network input x m and neuron n in input layer .
Symbols y n represents output signal of neuron n .
Propagation of signals through the hidden layer .
Symbols w mn represent weights of connections between output of neuron m and input of neuron n in the next layer .
Propagation of signals through the output layer .
In the next algorithm step the output signal of the network y is compared with the desired output value ( the target ) , which is found in training data set .
The difference is called error signal d of output layer neuron .
It is impossible to compute error signal for internal neurons directly , because output values of these neurons are unknown .
For many years the effective method for training multiplayer networks has been unknown .
Only in the middle eighties the backpropagation algorithm has been worked out .
The idea is to propagate error signal d ( computed in single teaching step ) back to all neurons , which output signals were input for discussed neuron .
The weights ' coefficients w mn used to propagate errors back are equal to this used during computing output value .
Only the direction of data flow is changed ( signals are propagated from output to inputs one after the other ) .
This technique is used for all network layers .
If propagated errors came from few neurons they are added .
The illustration is below :
When the error signal for each neuron is computed , the weights coefficients of each neuron input node may be modified .
In formulas below df(e ) / de represents derivative of neuron activation function ( which weights are modified ) .
Coefficient h affects network teaching speed .
There are a few techniques to select this parameter .
The first method is to start teaching process with large value of the parameter .
While weights coefficients are being established the parameter is being decreased gradually .
The second , more complicated , method starts teaching with small parameter value .
During the teaching process the parameter is being increased when the teaching is advanced and then decreased again in the final stage .
Starting teaching process with low parameter value enables to determine weights coefficients signs .

Notes on the Founding Fathers and the Separation of Church and State
by
R.P. Nettelhorst
Introduction
Many well - meaning Christians argue that the United States was founded by Christian men on Christian principles .
Although well - intentioned , such sentiment is unfounded .
The men who lead the United States in its revolution against England , who wrote the Declaration of Independence and put together the Constitution were not Christians by any stretch of the imagination .
Why do some Christians imagine these men are Christians ?
Besides a desperate desire that it should be so , in a selective examination of their writings , one can discover positive statements about God and / or Christianity .
However , merely believing in God does not make a person a Christian .
The Bible says that " the fool says in his heart , there is no God . "
Our founding fathers were not fools .
But the Bible also says " You say you believe in God. Good .
The demons also believe and tremble . "
Merely believing in God is insufficient evidence for demonstrating either Christian principles or that a person is a Christian .
Perhaps , to start , it might be beneficial to remind ourselves of what a Christian might be : it is a person who has acknowledged his or her sinfulness , responded in faith to the person of Jesus Christ as the only one who can redeem him , and by so doing been given the Holy Spirit .
The early church summarized the Christian message in six points :
1. Jesus came from God .
2 . You killed him .
3 . He rose again on the third day .
4 . He sent the Holy Spirit
5. Repent and be baptized .
6 . He 's coming back .
An individual who would not acknowledge this much of the Christian message could not , by any stretch of the imagination , be called a Christian .
The founding fathers of this country did not acknowledge this message .
In fact , they denied it .
Founders of the American Revolution
Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the gospels ; he was uncomfortable with any reference to miracles , so with two copies of the New Testament , he cut and pasted them together , excising all references to miracles , from turning water to wine , to the resurrection .
There has certainly never been a shortage of boldness in the history of biblical scholarship during the past two centuries , but for sheer audacity Thomas Jefferson 's two redactions of the Gospels stand out even in that company .
It is still a bit overwhelming to contemplate the sangfroid exhibited by the third president of the United States as , razor in hand , he sat editing the Gospels during February 1804 , on ( as he himself says ) " 2. or 3 . nights only at Washington , after getting thro ' the evening task of reading the letters and papers of the day . "
He was apparently quite sure that he could tell what was genuine and what was not in the transmitted text of the New Testament ... ( Thomas Jefferson .
The Jefferson Bible ; Jefferson and his Contemporaries , an afterward by Jaroslav Pelikan , Boston : Beacon Press , 1989 , p. 149 .
Click to go to a copy of The Jefferson Bible ) .
In his Notes on Virginia , Jefferson wrote :
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others .
But it does me no injury to my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god .
It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg .
( Dumas Malon , Jefferson The President : First Term 1801 - 1805 .
Boston : Little Brown and Company , 1970 , p. 191 )
Thomas Paine was a pamphleteer whose manifestoes encouraged the faltering spirits of the country and aided materially in winning the War of Independence .
But he was a Deist :
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church , by the Roman Church , by the Greek Church , by the Turkish Church , by the Protestant Church , nor by any church that I know of .
My own mind is my own church .
( Richard Emery Roberts , ed. " Excerpts from The Age of Reason " .
Selected Writings of Thomas Paine . New York : Everbody 's Vacation Publishing Co. , 1945 , p. 362 )
Regarding the New Testament , he wrote that :
I hold [ it ] to be fabulous and have shown [ it ] to be false ... ( Roberts , p. 375 )
About the afterlife , he wrote :
I do not believe because a man and a woman make a child that it imposes on the Creator the unavoidable obligation of keeping the being so made in eternal existance hereafter .
It is in His power to do so , or not to do so , and it is not in my power to decide which He will do .
( Roberts , p. 375 )
John Adams , the second U.S. President rejected the Trinity , the deity of Christ , and became a Unitarian .
It was during Adams ' presidency that the Senate ratified the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Tripoli , which states in Article XI that :
As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion - as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion or tranquility of Musselmen , - and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation , it is declared by the parties that no pretext arrising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries .
( Charles I. Bevans , ed. Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776 - 1949 .
Vol. 11 : Philippines - United Arab Republic .
Washington D.C. : Department of State Publications , 1974 , p. 1072 ) .
This treaty with the Islamic state of Tripoli had been written and concluded by Joel Barlow during Washington 's Administration .
The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty on June 7 , 1797 ; President Adams signed it on June 10 , 1797 and it was first published in the Session Laws of the Fifth Congress , first session in 1797 .
Quite clearly , then , at this very early stage of the American Republic , the U.S. government did not consider the United States a Christian nation .
Benjamin Franklin , the delegate to the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention .
He has frequently been used as a source for positive " God " talk .
It is often noted that Franklin made a motion at the Constitutional convention that they should bring in a clergyman to pray for their deliberations :
In this situation of this Assembly , groping as it were in the dark to find political truth , and scarce able to distinguish it when present to us , how has it happened , Sir , that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understandings ?.... I have lived , Sir , a long time , and the longer I live , the more convincing proofs I see of this truth - that God governs in the affairs of men .
( Catherine Drinker Bowen .
Miracle at Phaladelphia : The Story of the Constitutional Convention , May to September 1787 .
New York : Book - of - the - Month Club , 1966 , pp. 125-126 )
It is rarely noted that Franklin presented his motion after " four or five weeks " of deliberation , during which they had never once opened in prayer .
More significantly , it is never mentioned that Franklin 's motion was voted down !
Fine Christians , these founding fathers .
Furthermore , the context is usually ignored , too .
He made the motion during an especially trying week of serious disagreement , when the convention was in danger of breaking up .
Cathrine Drinker Bowen comments :
Yet whether the Doctor had spoken from policy or from faith , his suggestion had been salutary , calling an assembly of doubting minds to a realization that destiny herself sat as guest and witness in this room .
Franklin had made solemn reminder that a republic of thirteen united states - venture novel and daring - could not be achieved without mutual sacrifice and a summoning up of men's best , most difficult and most creative efforts .
( Bowen , p. 127 )
About March 1 , 1790 , he wrote the following in a letter to Ezra Stiles , president of Yale , who had asked him his views on religion .
His answer would indicate that he remained a Deist , not a Christian , to the end :
As to Jesus of Nazareth , my Opinion of whom you particularly desire , I think the System of Morals and his Religion , as he left them to us , the best the world ever saw or is likely to see ; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes , and I have , with most of the present Dissenters in England , some Doubts as to his divinity ; tho ' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon , having never studied it , and I think it needless to busy myself with it now , when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble .... " ( Carl Van Doren .
Benjamin Franklin . New York : The Viking Press , 1938 , p. 777 . )
He died a little over a month later on April 17 .
Deism
Certainly it is generally the case that these people believed in God , but it was not the God of Christianity .
Deism began in the eighteenth century and was very popular in America .
According to the dictionary , it was " a system of thought advocating natural religion based on human reason rather than revelation . "
Jefferson wrote that the religious doctrines of Jesus that he accepted , and which he regarded as consistent with his deistic perspective were three :
1. that there is one God , and he all - perfect :
2. that there is a future state of rewards and punishments
3. that to love God with all thy heart , and thy neighbor as thyself , is the sum of religion .
Why do Christians want the founding fathers to be Christians ?
Is it because they wish the best for these people ?
Hardly .
It is because they hope that by demonstrating they were Christians , they can justify their political agenda .
Rather than wanting something new ( the injection of Christianity into government ) they seek to restore something they imagine has been lost .
Reality : nothing has been lost .
It was n't there to start with .
Therefore the whole concept of " taking back America " is a lie .
America was never Christian .
Recent Misinformation on the Concept of Separation of Church and State
Some Christians are currently arguing that the concept of separating church and state was not in the minds of the founding fathers , and that it is a recent and pernicious doctrine that is the result of Supreme Court decisions in the 1950's and 60s .
This simply is n't true .
Separation of church and state is not something the Supreme Court invented in the 1950's and 60's .
The phrase itself appears in a letter from President Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association of Danbury , Connecticut , on Jan 1 , 1802 .
The Baptist Association had written to President Jefferson regarding a " rumor that a particular denomination was soon to be recognized as the national denomination . "
Jefferson responded to calm their fears by assuring them that the federal government would not establish any single denomination of Christianity as the National denomination .
He wrote : " The First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between Church and State . "
Notice the phrasing in the U.S. Constitution , Article VI , paragraph 3 :
The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the Members of the several State Legislatures , and all executive and judicial Officers , both of the United States and of the several States , shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States .

The concept of the separation of church and state appears in the 1963 Baptist Faith and Message ( a revision of an earlier statement where it also appears ) adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention :
God alone is Lord of the conscience , and He has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are contrary to His Word or not contained in it .
Church and state should be separate .
The state owes to every church protection and full freedom in the pursuit of its spiritual ends .
In providing for such freedom no ecclesiastical group or denomination should be favored by the state more than others .
Civil government being ordained of God , it is the duty of Christians to render loyal obedience thereto in all things not contrary to the revealed will of God .
The church should not resort to the civil power to carry on its work .
The gospel of Christ contemplates spiritual means alone for the pursuit of its ends .
The state has no right to impose penalties for religious opinions of any kind .
The state has no right to impose taxes for the support of any form of religion .
A free church in a free state is the Christian ideal , and this implies the right of free and unhindered access to God on the part of all men , and the right to form and propagate opinions in the sphere of religion without interference by the civil power .
( emphasis added ) .
Look at what Roger Williams , the founder of Rhode Island , had to say about religious freedom in the 17th century .
He was a Baptist persecuted for his faith who argued for the separation of church and state nearly a hundred fifty years before Jefferson .
The Church and State need not be , Williams insisted , inextricably linked : 'A Pagan or Antichristian Pilot may be as skillful to carry the Ship to its desired Port , as any Christian Mariner or Pilot in the World , and may perform that work with as much safety and speed . '
' God requireth not an Uniformity of Religion to be inacted and inforced in any Civill State , ' he declared .
Rather , the tares in the field of Christian grain must be left alone ; let man hold whatever religious opinions he chooses provided he does not ' actually disturb civil peace , ' ran a provision of the Rhode Island Charter of 1663 ; let civil government be based on the consent of the governed .
' The Soveraigne , originall , and foundation of civil power lies in the People , ' Williams insisted .
They 'may erect and establish what forme of Government seemes to them most meete for their Civill condition . '
William 's plea for Separation of Church and State stemmed far less , Harold Laski writes , from tender concern for men's consciences than from 'a fear that their unity meant the government of the Church by civil men and thus a threat to its purity . '
Popular control of the Church through elected magistrates Williams thought evil since it gave the Church ' to Satan himself , by whom all peoples natural are guided . '
The precise intention of Scripture could not be ascertained , he believed , with the icy certainty claimed by the New England clergy .
He wanted Church and State separated so the Church would not be corrupted by the State .
Thomas Jefferson entertained the opposite conviction , fearing that the State would become contaminated by the Church .

In his tract on the topic of religious toleration Williams made some important points :
... Fourthly .
The doctrine of persecution for cause of conscience , is proved guilty of all the blood of the souls crying for vengeance under the altar .
Fifthly .
All civil states , with their officers of justice , in their respective constitutions and administrations , are proved essentially civil , and therefore not judges , governors , or defenders of the spiritual , or Christian , state and worship .
Sixthly .
It is the will and command of God that , since the coming of his Son the Lord Jesus , a permission of the most Paganish , Jewish , Turkish , or antichristian consciences and worships be granted to all men in all nations and countries : and they are only to be fought against with that sword which is only , in soul matters , able to conquer : to wit , the sword of God 's Spirit , the word of God.
Seventhly .
The state of the land of Israel , the kings and people thereof , in peace and war , is proved figurative and ceremonial , and no pattern nor precedent for any kingdom or civil state in the world to follow .
Eighthly .
God requireth not an uniformity of religion to be enacted and enforced in any civil state ; which enforced uniformity , sooner or later , is the greatest occasion of civil war , ravishing of conscience , persecution of Christ Jesus in his servants , and of the hypocrisy and destruction of millions of souls .
Ninthly .
In holding an enforced uniformity of religion in a civil state , we must necessarily disclaim our desires and hopes of the Jews ' conversion to Christ .
Tenthly .
An enforced uniformity of religion throughout a nation or civil state , confounds the civil and religious , denies the principles of Christianity and civility , and that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh .
Eleventhly .
The permission of other consciences and worships than a state professeth , only can , according to God , procure a firm and lasting peace ; good assurance being taken , according to the wisdom of the civil state , for uniformity of civil obedience from all sorts .
Twelfthly .
Lastly , true civility and Christianity may both flourish in a state or kingdom , notwithstanding the permission of divers and contrary consciences , either of Jew or Gentile ... ( Roger Williams .

Notice what Ulysses S. Grant said in his seventh annual address ( State of the Union address ) to the Congress , December 7 , 1875 :
As this will be the last annual message which I shall have the honor of transmitting to Congress before my successor is chosen , I will repeat or recapitulate the questions which I deem of vital importance which may be legislated upon and settled at this session : First .
That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common - school education to every child within their limits .
Second .
No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or in part by the State , nation , or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any community .
Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890 , disfranchising none , however , on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect .
Third .
Declare church and state forever separate and distinct , but each free within their proper spheres ; and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation ( emphasis added ) .
( A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents .
Vol. X. New York : Bureau of National Literature , Inc. , 1897 , p. 4310 )
Here is a quotation from the Encyclopedic Index of A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents , published in 1917 :
Religious Freedom . - The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ( q.v. ) requires that " Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
Religious freedom doubtless had its greatest inspiration from James Madison while he was in the Virginia Legislature .
An attempt was made to levy a tax upon the people of that state " for the support of teachers of the Christian religion . "
Madison wrote what he called a " Memorial and Remonstrance , " in which he appealed to the people against the evil tendency of such a precedent , and which convinced people that Madison was right .
A bill was passed providing " that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship , place , or ministry whatsoever * * * nor shall suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief ; but that all men shall be free to profess , and , by argument , maintain their opinions in matters of religion , and that the same shall in nowise diminish , enlarge , or affect their civil capacities . "
The religious test to which many of the states put their office - holders were gradually abandoned , and the final separation of church and state in America came in 1833 , when Massachusetts discontinued the custom of paying preachers ( emphasis added ) .
( A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents , Vol. XX .
New York : Bureau of National Literature , Inc. , 1917 ) .
It should be clear , from these quotations , that the concept of separating church and state is hardly of recent invention in the United States , since we see it as far back as at least 1644 .
It can not seriously be argued that it sprang as a result of weird ideas in the 1950's and 60's .
In point of fact , the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court at that time on school prayer are entirely consistent with the general thrust of U.S. history .
If this is a " Christian " nation , then why did Jefferson write what he did to a group of Baptists ?
Should n't he instead of said that they had something to worry about ?
If the concept of separating church and state were a recent idea , then why did Jefferson himself use it , one of the founding fathers and author of the Declaration of Independence ?
I think it is a big surprise to the Jewish people who have been living here for longer than my ancestors ( who only got here in the middle of the 19th century ) to think that this is a " Christian " nation .
If it were " Christian " then there would be religious requirements to be a part of it and to participate in the public arena .
If this were a Christian nation , then why are so few Americans Christians ?
Even the most optimistic Gallup pole shows that barely 1/3 of the U.S. population claims to be " born again " .
Interestingly , that 's up considerably since the time of the nation 's founding , when barely ten percent , if that , claimed intense religious affiliation .
I believe that those who talk about " restoring " prayer to the public school have a misunderstanding of the Supreme Court ruling and have failed to carefully think through their position .
The Supreme Court decided in 1962 that for the school administrators to write prayers and read them over the intercoms to the students was wrong .
It is hard for me to figure out how anyone in their right mind would think it 's a good idea for the state to compose prayers and force them on people .
So why would you want to " restore " government sponsored religiosity ?
Students and faculty and other employees are free to pray for themselves if they want ; that has never been a problem ( admittedly , some examples of overzealous administrators who did n't understand the issue , who tried to stop individuals from exercising their religious beliefs , can doubtless be found ; but that is the exception , not the rule .
That there are murderers is not proof that murder is legal . ) .
As a Baptist , I frankly would be bothered by a Moslem or a Hindu writing a prayer for my child .
I no more want them imposing their religious views on me and mine than they would want me to impose my Baptist beliefs on them .
And what about the agnostics and atheists ?
They no more wish to be inundated by religious concepts in school than I would like to have my children inundated by their beliefs ( or lack thereof ) .
The attempt in the public arena is toward neutrality ; certainly it is a tough ideal to reach , and certainly there are a lot of mistakes made on all sides .
Certainly , too , in the past there has been a lot of inconsistency in these ideals .
But the ideal remains nevertheless .
The history of the U.S. has been one of lofty ideals rarely achieved ; our shame is that we so rarely reach what we proclaim : freedom , equality , and the like .
But our pride is that , unlike so many before , at least we have ideals and we 're trying , how often unsuccessfully , by fits and starts , to reach them .
Most of the political disagreements between the parties is not so much over the goals ( both Democrats and Republicans want a free , prosperous , safe and happy society ) , but over the methods to reach those goals .
Demonizing the opposition is not reasonable , and both parties are guilty of this ( Democrats tend to turn Republicans into Fascists and Republicans tend to turn Democrats into Communists ; neither caricature is accurate , appropriate or dignified ) .
The American Revolution , at its Foundation , was Unscriptural
At its foundation , our American revolution was unscriptural .
Therefore I have a hard time seeing how our government could have been founded on Christian principles , when its very founding violated one :
Submit yourselves for the Lord 's sake to every authority instituted among men : whether to the king , as the supreme authority , or to governors , who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right .
( 1 Peter 2:13 - 14 )
No matter how you cut it , the founding fathers were revolting against the King of England .
It should be remembered that Peter wrote these words while Israel was suffering under the domination of government far more oppressive than England ever was .
In fact , compared to current taxes , our forefathers had nothing to complain about .
What Peter wrote seems perfectly clear and unambiguous ; furthermore , it is consistent with what Jesus said about his kingdom not being a part of this world ( John 18:23 and 36 ) .
As a Christian , it would be very difficult to justify armed revolt against any ruler .
Passive resistance to injustice and evil , as embodied in the concept of civil disobedience , however , does have Scriptural precedent ( as for instance in the case of the early Christians described in Acts 5:28 - 29 :
" We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name , " he said .
" Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man 's blood . "
Peter and the other apostles replied : " We must obey God rather than men ! " ( see also Acts 4:18 - 20 )
Civil disobedience means obeying a higher , moral law , but willingly suffering the consequences of your actions and submitting to the authority of those in power to arrest or even kill you for your disobedience .
Peter and the others were arrested , and many of them were ultimately martyred .
But they never participated in violent protest , nor did they resist those in authority by violence .
Conclusion
Certainly many of the early immigrants to the New World came for religious reasons - often to escape persecution .
However , they were not interested in religious freedom for anyone other than themselves , and often turned around and persecuted others who had slightly different viewpoints .
As Pastor Richard T. Zuelch pointed out in his letter to the Los Angeles Times on August 14 , 1995 :
Gordon S. Wood , in his 1992 book , " The Radicalism of the American Revolution , " states that , by the 1790's only about 10 % of the American population regularly attended religious services - to quote just one statistic .
Not exactly an indication of a wholehearted national commitment to Christianity !
It is a matter of simple historical fact that the United States was not founded as , nor was it ever intended to be , a Christian nation .
That there were strong , long - lasting Christian influences involved in the nation 's earliest history , due to the Puritan settlements and those of other religious persons escaping European persecution , cannot be denied .
But that is a long way from saying that colonial leaders , by the time of the outbreak of the Revolution , were intending to form a nation founded on specifically Christian principles and doctrine .
We Christians do ourselves no favor by bending history to suit our prejudices or to accommodate wishful thinking .
Rather than continue to cling to a " Moral Majority " - style fantasy that says America is a Christian nation that needs to be " taken back " from secular unbelief ( we can't " take back " what we never had ) , it would be much healthier for us Christians to face reality , holding to what Jesus himself said in the Gospels : that Christians should never be surprised at the hostility with which the gospel would be greeted by the world , because most people would fail to believe in him , thereby strongly implying that , in every age and country , Christianity would always be a minority faith .
( Rev. Richard T. Zuelch , Letter to the Editor , Los Angeles Times , August 1995 )
The United States is not , by any stretch of the imagination a Christian nation today , nor has it ever been , nor was it ever intended to be .
The Religious right ( or left ) would do well to stop looking for the Kingdom of Heaven here on Earth .

Notes on the Separation of Church and State
Malawi is one of the world 's poorest countries
BBC Radio Five Live found £ 712,000 was spent in four years on hotels and meals for a project run by a US consultancy .
The National Audit Office said it may mount an investigation into the use of consultants by the Department for International Development ( DFID ) .
DFID said Malawian MPs and NGOs were the beneficiaries and efforts were being made to reduce costs .
" The purpose was to debate the establishment of committees that would scrutinise the work of the Malawian government , " a spokesman said .
" It was also to allow the three groups to work better together to communicate what the Malawian government was doing . "
DFID said the expenses needed to be set against the £ 60 m it was spending on Malawi aid projects this year .
The International Development Secretary Hilary Benn told the BBC there were occasions when it was " sensible " to use consultants , but the DFID was making efforts to reduce its costs .
" We did ask them to use more Malawian staff , and they 're in the process of doing that , " he said .
Reducing poverty
US agencies which had been brought in as consultants included the National Democratic Institute ( NDI ) , used on a training project to improve the parliamentary committee system in Malawi .
Where there are lessons to be learnt I 'm very determined that we do that
Hilary Benn , International Development Secretary
From Our Own Correspondent
Another US group , World Learning , were hired to distribute £ 4 m of British money to strengthen Malawian society but the Tikambirane Programme was cancelled this year after six months at a cost of £ 300,000 .
Mr Benn said the department had become concerned about that project 's administrative costs .
DFID 's funding priorities had also changed after the drought in Malawi which has since seen the government provide another £ 10 m in aid , he said .
" There clearly have been some problems with the projects , and where there are lessons to be learned I 'm very determined that we do that , " he added .
' Phantom aid '
Five Live Report looked at several projects funded by the department in Malawi , which is considered to be the 10th - poorest country in the world .
There are large areas of the aid system that are in urgent need of reform
Patrick Watt
Action Aid
The £ 1 m donated to the NDI project from US funds was used solely to pay its staff in Washington DC .
Over the four years of the project , the DFID donated £ 3 m to it .
Of that , £ 586,423 was spent on hotels in Malawi for the MPs and the NGOs .
Another £ 126,062 was spent on meals .
An ex-staff member said computers , notebooks and other stationery had been bought in Washington DC and flown over rather than bought locally .
An NDI spokeswoman defended the spending , and said the British department had never questioned it at the time .
World Learning said the whole venture was " unfortunate for all of us but most of all for the Malawian organisations which should have been helped as a result " .
Patrick Watt of charity Actionaid said : " ( This is ) another example of aid money not really getting down to people who most urgently need to benefit from it .
" It 's an example of phantom aid , when what Malawi needs is real aid . "
Mr Watt said the large amounts of money spent of administration and overseas staff meant " there are large areas of the aid system that are in urgent need of reform " .
IF repossessing a used Chevrolet can be tricky , consider retrieving the Aztec Express , a 700 - foot cargo ship under guard in Haiti as civil unrest spread through the country .
Only a few repo men possess the guile and resourcefulness for such a job .
One of them is F. Max Hardberger , of Lacombe , La. Since 1991 , the 58 - year - old attorney and ship captain has surreptitiously sailed away about a dozen freighters from ports around the world .
“ I ’m sure there are those who would like to add me to a list of modern pirates of the Caribbean , but I do whatever I can to protect the legal rights of my clients , ” said Hardberger , whose company , Vessel Extractions in New Orleans , has negotiated the releases of another dozen cargo ships and prevented the seizures of many others .
His line of work regularly takes him to a corner of the maritime industry still plagued by pirates , underhanded business practices and corrupt government officials , waters the Aztec Express sailed right into .
Advertisement
The saga began in 2003 when the vessel ’s Greek owner died and his company did not keep up payments on a $ 3.3 - million mortgage .
Bahamian court records show that an American businessman who had used the vessel to haul 235 used cars from the northeastern United States to Haiti did not pay the charter fee , contributing to the loan default .
Once the ship arrived in the Haitian port of Miragoane , the businessman bribed judicial officials to seize the vessel and sell it to him in a rigged auction , according to court records .
Meanwhile , a violent rebellion threatened to topple President Jean - Bertrand Aristide , making it impossible for the lender or the owner ’s relatives to contest the sale .
Advertisement
The condition of the Aztec Express further complicated matters .
Its main engines were out of commission , having been idle and untended for months .
Hardberger was hired by the New Jersey - based mortgage holder .
He flew to Haiti and drove with an armed bodyguard to Miragoane .
He gathered two important pieces of information .
Watchmen stationed on the Aztec Express sold fuel from the vessel on the black market .
Second , port authorities had a cellphone , but they could use it only at the harbor ’s soccer field , where cellular service was reliable .
Hardberger managed to get the guards off the ship by offering to buy fuel .
When they came down to the dock to discuss the transaction , off - duty Haitian riot police hired by Hardberger held them at bay .
Advertisement
MEANWHILE , an oceangoing tugboat also hired by Hardberger slipped into port and backed up to the Aztec Express .
Under a full moon , the crew began cutting the anchor chains with blowtorches .
In case harbor officials noticed and tried to call for help on their cellphone , Hardberger had paid a witch doctor $ 100 to cast spells on the port ’s soccer field .
The witch doctor marked the field with gray powder , a clear warning to believers in voodoo , the nation ’s dominant religion .
No call ever went out .
Once the freighter was freed , the tug hauled the ship out of port and headed for the Bahamas , where British - based maritime laws give a high priority to lenders ’ claims .
The next day , however , another tug intercepted the ship .
Its captain said he had been sent to take over the operation .
Advertisement
Hardberger ’s team checked with the marine towing company hired for the repossession and found that no relief boat had been sent .
It then summoned the Bahamian coast guard , which detained the other tug on suspicion of attempted piracy .
Hardberger said the second tugboat had been sent by the American businessman when he learned that the Aztec Express had been pulled out of Haiti .
In the Bahamas , a court upheld the ship ’s repossession and ordered its sale to settle the lender ’s claim .
“ Haiti has a corrupt legal system where cronyism and corruption are the order of the day , ” Judge John Lyons wrote in his decision .
“ Justice is dispensed according to who can pay the going rate . ”
Advertisement
Hardberger said small - to - medium - size cargo ships such as the Aztec Express are among the most vulnerable to chicanery and illegal seizures .
Often operated by small shipping lines , these modern - day tramp steamers regularly visit developing countries plagued by unstable and corrupt governments .
In the worst - off nations , Hardberger said , it is possible to seize a $ 10 - million ship with a $ 100 bribe to a justice of the peace .
“ You need more than what an attorney can do in some of these countries , ” said John Lightbown , a ship owner who recently sought Hardberger ’s help to avert a seizure in Haiti .
Advertisement
“ Deals can be bought and sold under the table .
Max gets into the middle of things .
He ’s been around the block , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know anyone who does this , except for Max , ” said Jonathan S. Spencer , a New York - based maritime adjuster who determines the monetary losses of shipping accidents .
“ It ’s hard to say how much people like him are used .
They work in gray areas of the law .
They are very discreet , and the people who hire them are discreet as well . ”
WITH his graying hair , walrus mustache and moderate build , Hardberger does n’t fit the profile of a swashbuckler .
He taught history and English at parochial schools in Louisiana and Mississippi after graduating from the University of New Orleans and earning a master ’s degree from the University of Iowa Writers ’ Workshop .
Advertisement
Outside the classroom , he worked on Gulf Coast oil rigs and the vessels that served them .
For several years in the 1980s he skippered a cargo ship in the Caribbean and later wrote “ Freighter Captain , ” a novel based on the experience .
In 1998 , after a four - year correspondence course , he passed the California bar exam on the first try .
He now practices maritime law , mostly in the Caribbean , but regularly comes to Southern California to handle cases .
Hardberger fell into the ship extraction business in 1991 while managing two freighters for Morgan Price & Co. , a wastepaper exporter in Miami .
Morgan Price had chartered one of the vessels , the Patric M , to a Peruvian company that used it to carry steel to Venezuela .
Advertisement
When the company refused to pay Morgan Price $ 80,000 , the Miami firm instructed the captain to dock at Puerto Cabello in Venezuela , its destination , but not unload the cargo .
In retaliation , Hardberger said , the Peruvian firm bribed court officials to detain the Patric M in port and allow the company to operate it .
A judge even jailed the master and chief engineer , but not before the engineer was forced at gunpoint to power up the vessel ’s cranes so unloading could proceed .
Hardberger flew to Venezuela .
He says he persuaded court officials to put the captain and chief engineer under house arrest at a hotel .
Hardberger then met with the two men .
The captain refused to participate in the repossession , fearing for his safety .
When the chief engineer agreed to help , he and Hardberger slipped out of the hotel through a laundry room .
Advertisement
In the evening , they took a taxi to the waterfront and walked along the port wall that was topped with barbed wire , finally gaining entry by crawling under a railroad gate .
Once inside the port , Hardberger said , they hid in doorways , culverts and the shadows of shipping containers to elude guards and stevedores .
“ Extractions are a big risk .
If you get caught , you are looking at a very serious charge , ” Hardberger said .
“ In some countries , you could wait two or three years for trial and end up with a 20 - year sentence . ”
At the unguarded ship , both men climbed the gangway , and Hardberger found the first mate , a heavy - set Panamanian , who agreed to cooperate .
Advertisement
The Patric M ’s crew , which had not been replaced by the Peruvian company , was assembled in the mess for a briefing .
Everyone signed on to the plan .
Later in the evening , the crew cut the ship ’s lines from the deck .
The main engine came to life with a few deep thumps .
Proceeding at “ dead slow ahead , ” Hardberger steered the 340 - foot cargo ship past a naval base and through the narrow harbor entrance .
En route to Aruba , Hardberger said , he received a radio message saying Venezuela had notified Interpol -- the global police agency -- that the ship had departed without permission .
Advertisement
He soon found an isolated anchorage off the island of Vieques , Puerto Rico .
The crew ground off the original name and identification numbers that are stamped into the steel of every cargo ship when it is built .
All the Patric M ’s documents -- plans , ledgers , log books and certifications -- were copied and altered to reflect its new name .
The originals were destroyed , including its Panamanian registration forms .
Then , Hardberger said , he found a country willing to register stateless vessels , no questions asked .
He declined to name the country , but there were only a few at the time , such as Honduras , Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands .
International regulatory agencies have since banned the practice .
About a year after acquiring its new identity , the Patric M was sold by Morgan Price .
Advertisement
“ International waters , ” Hardberger said , “ are worse than the Wild West .
In many ways , there is little or no opportunity to avenge the wrongs people have done to you . ”
For the last 3 1/2 years , Hardberger has operated Vessel Extractions with Michael L. Bono , an admiralty law attorney and one of his former high school students .
BEFORE repossessing a ship , they make sure the vessel has been seized illegally and the claims filed against it are fraudulent .
If negotiations and legal methods fail , the company will proceed with an extraction , a step that might include payments to local officials if a nation ’s government is corrupt .
Advertisement
Those payments , Hardberger said , are made under exceptions in the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which prohibits U.S. citizens from bribing foreign officials to retain or obtain business .
“ In a rogue state , you ca n’t tie your hands behind you , ” Hardberger said .
“ It is common to find that the court system is rife with corruption . ”
Extracting a ship can cost a client $ 100,000 or more .
If a repossession is requested , Hardberger and his team quietly enter the country involved .
They seek out friendly officials and trusted local contacts such as ship agents who tend to a vessel ’s logistical needs in port .
Advertisement
“ You need to pick up clues about the ship and what is said in the bars , at the ship chandlers and in the local whorehouses , ” Hardberger said .
“ Crews are not that sophisticated and talk about their orders and departure times .
You can really keep track of a vessel this way . ”
Hardberger said he does not carry a firearm , though he has hired bodyguards , as he did with the Aztec Express .
Stealth and trickery are the preferred methods .
“ I do not want my face seen , ” he added .
Such tactics were employed in April 1999 , when Hardberger was asked to extract a 280 - foot cargo ship that had put in for repairs at Drapetsona , a part of the Greek port of Piraeus .
“ It ’s a place , ” he says , “ where ship names are repainted quickly . ”
Advertisement
The small freighter was Hungarian and , despite the fall of the Soviet Union , was still equipped with a commissar ’s office .
It contained a secret radio room and the complete works of Lenin .
When the repair company charged four times the agreed - upon price to fix a huge dent in the stern , Hardberger said , the owner refused to pay .
Port officials then denied the vessel a clearance to leave .
Hardberger and the ship ’s agent got permission to move the ship to a port anchorage under the ruse that she needed refueling .
The new location would make it possible for a crew to reach the vessel by launch .
Then , with everything in place , Hardberger waited for the weekend of Greek Easter , a religious festival marked by rich pageantry and widespread celebration .
Advertisement
To help the coast guard enjoy the event , Hardberger arranged for the ship agent to drop off several cases of ouzo at the station , which overlooked the port .
At 2 a.m. on a Sunday , a crew boarded the unattended freighter and sailed it out of the harbor unnoticed .
Hardberger , who coordinated the operation from shore , sat in a seaman ’s bar in Piraeus with friends , including the ship ’s agent .
In the ancient port , they toasted their success with vodka .

YB0 is the biggest and most impressive element of the CMS
Giant laboratory
A 2,000 - tonne piece of machinery has been successfully lowered by crane into a man-made cavern 100 m below ground .
The machinery is part of the Compact Muon Solenoid ( CMS ) , one of four big experiments belonging to the world 's most powerful particle accelerator .
A spokesman said : " Champagne corks are popping - it has all gone very well . "
To see them being assembled is exciting and partly emotional
Jim Virdee
CMS team spokesman
' It 's like a film set '
It is a powerful and complicated machine , which will smash particles together at super - fast speeds in a bid to unlock the secrets of the Universe .
The LHC comprises over 1,000 powerful magnets occupying a subterranean tunnel that runs in a ring for 27km .
The magnets carry two beams of particles around the ring at speeds close to the speed of light .
Critical parts
At certain points along this ring , the beams cross over , causing some of the particles to collide head - on .
Each of the four huge LHC experiments , including the CMS , sits near one of these crossing points .
These experiments , or detectors , will capture and measure new particles produced in the collisions .
These could point to new phenomena beyond the so - called standard model of physics - a framework to explain the interactions of sub-atomic particles .
The CMS is being lowered into its underground cavern piece by piece
Enlarge Image
The 2,000 - tonne piece that was winched down the 100 m shaft at Cern on Wednesday is the largest and most impressive segment of the CMS .
It took about 12 hours to lower the part into place .
It is called the Yoke Barrel 0 , or YB0 for short , and forms the central " barrel wheel " segment of the CMS experiment .
It is flanked on either side by two smaller wheels .
The YB0 element will house most of the critical inner parts of the experiment and is about 16 m tall , 17 m wide and 13 m long .
" It is the largest of 15 pieces due to go down , " said Jim Virdee , chief spokesman for the CMS science team .
" We were drawing all these things 15 years ago on a piece of paper .
So to see them being assembled is exciting and partly emotional . "
' God ' particle
So far , eight of the 15 key elements that make up the CMS have been successfully lowered .
YB0 was the ninth .
The experiment will now have to be assembled into its final configuration inside the cavern .
In its final form , the Compact Muon Solenoid will be cylindrical , 21 m long and 16 m in diameter and weigh approximately 12,500 tonnes .
The CMS is one of two general purpose experiments at the LHC .
It will aim to identify the elusive Higgs boson ( known as the " God particle " because of its importance to the standard model of physics ) , look for so - called supersymmetric particles and seek out the existence of extra dimensions .
Science operations should begin early in 2008 .

This article has become an annual tradition at Coyote Blog , I guess to make sure I start the new year with plenty of hate mail .
The concept of a cultural celebration by African - Americans of themselves and their history is a good one .
The specific values celebrated in Kwanzaa , however , suck .
They are socialist - Marxist - collectivist - totalitarian crap .
Everyone seems to tiptoe around Kwanzaa feeling that they have to be respectful , I guess because they are fearful of being called a racist .
However , I find it terrible to see such a self - destructive set of values foisted on the African - American community .
These values are nearly perfectly constructed to keep blacks in poverty - just look at how well these
same values have played out in Africa .
First , understand that I have no problem with people of any ethnic group or race or whatever creating a holiday .
Life is worth celebrating , as often as possible , even if we have to make up new occasions .
One of the great things about living in Arizona is getting to celebrate Cinco de Mayo .
Second , understand that Kwanzaa is not some ancient African ethno- cultural tradition .
Kwanzaa was made up in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga .
Karenga was a radical Marxist in the 60's black power movement .
Later , Karenga served time in jail for torturing two women :
Deborah Jones ... said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes .
She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis ' mouth and placed against Miss Davis ' face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vice .
Karenga ... also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths , she said . "
Interestingly , after this conviction as well incidents of schizophrenia in prison where " the psychiatrist observed that Karenga talked to his blanket and imaginary persons and believed that he had been attacked by dive - bombers , " California State University at Long Beach saw fit to
make him head of their Black Studies Department .
Anyway , I give credit to Karenga for wanting to create a holiday for African - Americans that paid homage to themselves and their history .
However , what Karenga created was a 7 - day holiday built around 7 principles , which are basically a seven step plan to Marxism .
Instead of rejecting slavery entirely , Kwanzaa celebrates a transition from enslavement of blacks by whites to enslavement of blacks by blacks .
Here are the 7 values , right from the Kwanzaa site ( with my comments in red itallics ) :
Umoja ( Unity )
To strive for and maintain unity in the family , community , nation and race
On its surface , this is either a platitude , or , if serious , straight Marxism and thoroughly racist .
Think about who else in the 20th century talked about unity of race , and with what horrible results .
In practice , the notion of unity in the black movement has become sort of a law of Omerta -- no black is ever , ever supposed to publicly criticize another black .
Do n't believe me ?
Look at the flack Bill Cosby caught for calling out other blacks .
Kujichagulia ( Self - Determination )
To define ourselves , name ourselves , create for ourselves and speak for ourselves Generally cool with me -- can't get a libertarian to argue with this .
When this was first written in the 60's , it probably meant something more
revolutionary , like secession into a black state , but in today 's context I think it is fine .
Ujima ( Collective Work and Responsibility )
To
build and maintain our community together and make our brother 's and
sister 's problems our problems and to solve them together Um , do I even need to comment ?
This is Marxism , pure and simple .
Ujamaa ( Cooperative Economics )
To build and maintain our own stores , shops and other businesses and to profit from them together .
OK , I said the last one was Marxism .
This one is really , really Marxism .
Nia ( Purpose )
To
make our collective vocation the building and developing of our
community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness .
There 's that collectivism again Kuumba ( Creativity )
To
do always as much as we can , in the way we can , in order to leave our
community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it .
I guess I do n't have much problem with creativity and make things better .
My sense though that if I was to listen to the teaching on this one in depth , we would get collectivism again .
Imani ( Faith )
To
believe with all our heart in our people , our parents , our teachers ,
our leaders and the righteousness and victory of our struggle .
What about in ourselves as individuals ?
Through all of this , where is the individual , either individual responsibility or achievement ?
It is interesting that a holiday that
was invented specifically to be anti-religious would put " faith " in as a value .
In fact , Karenga despised the belief in God as paying homage to " spooks who threaten us if we do n't worship them and demand we turn
over our destiny and daily lives . "
However , this is in fact very consistent with the teachings of most statists and totalitarians .
They tend to reject going on bended knee to some god , and then turn right around and demand that men go on bended knee to ... them , or other men .
This is in fact what this " faith " was about for Karenga - he is a statist laying the foundation for obedience to the totalitarian state .
He wants blacks to turn over their destiny and daily lives to their leaders , not to god .
So , in conclusion , Kwanzaa was designed as a celebration of creating a totalitarian collectivist Marxist racist state among African - Americans .
I may well get comments and emails that say " oh ,
thats not how we celebrate it " and I will say fine - but Marxism is the core DNA of the holiday , a holiday created by a man who thought Lenin and the Black Panthers were all wimps .
Never wishing to criticize without suggestion a solution , here are alternate values I might suggest :
Freedom
- Every individual is his own master .
We will never accept any other master again from any race ( even our own ) .
We will speak out against injustices and inequalities so our children can be free as well .
Self - Reliance - Each individual will take responsibility for their life and the lives of their family Pride -
We will be proud of our race and heritage .
We will learn about our past and about slavery in particular , so we will never again repeat it .
Entrepreneurship -
We will work through free exchange with others to make our lives better and to improve the lives of our children Education -
We will dedicate ourselves and our time to education of our children , both in their knowledge and their ethics Charity -
We will help others in our country and our community through difficult times Thankfulness - Every African - American should wake up each morning and say " I give thanks that my ancestors suffered the horrors of the slavery passage , suffered the indignity and humiliation of slavery , and suffered the poverty and injustices of the
post - war South so that I , today , can be here , in this country , infinitely more free , healthier , safer and better off financially than I would have been in Africa . "
By the way , if you doubt that last part , note that in the late 90's , median per capita income of African Americans was about $ 25,000 , while the per capita income of Africans back in the " old country " was around $ 700 , or about 35 x less .
Note further this comparison of freedom between the US and various African nations .
Finally , just read the news about the Congo or Rwanda or the Sudan .
Update : Even years later , commenters insist on misinterpreting this last point as some sort of justification for slavery .
I am not sure how one can come to this conclusion in an article that drips with disdain for slavery , but folks will find what they want to find .
My mistake perhaps was to presume to speak for African Americans .
It is very possible that the enslavement of their ancestors and the legacy of racist crap that still exists in this country is not balanced by the prosperity blacks now enjoy in America vs. Africa .
So I will merely speak for myself and say the rest of us are immeasurably better off for having you here .

Download Report » Pet Cloning : Separating Fact From Fluff ( 2005 ) Buyers Beware : Pet Cloning is Not for Pet Lovers ( 2008 )
Studies show that cloning remains an experimental technology with an extremely high failure rate .
Behind each cute picture of a cuddly cloned cat or dog lie hundreds of animals who were kept in laboratory cages and subjected to painful and invasive procedures to produce just that one cloned animal .
For all that , you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to resemble the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems .
Meanwhile , millions of animals languish in shelters awaiting adoption every year .
With our No Pet Cloning campaign , AAVS seeks to protect both animals and people from harm and exploitation .
We vigorously campaigned until the only U.S. companies that sold cloned animals closed their doors .
First it was Genetic Savings & Clone , Inc , and then it was BioArts International .
Currently , cat and dog cloning experiments for commercial pet sales are only being conducted in South Korea .
When BioArts closed , its owner , Lou Hawthorne , finally admitted to the problems with pet cloning that we have been warning about for years .
According to Hawthorne , he has seen numerous abnormalities during his pet cloning attempts :
" One clone � which was supposed to be black and white � was born greenish - yellow where it should have been white .
Others have had skeletal malformations , generally not crippling though sometimes serious and always worrisome .
One clone of a male donor was actually born female ( we still have no good explanation for how that happened ) . "
Hawthorne spent years trying to clone his family dog , Missy , as part of his venture .
Yet , according to an article on the Veterinary Information Network , Inc. , " Hawthorne 's mother , who was the original owner of Missy , says the clones have very different temperaments from the original .
For one thing , the original Missy was ' robust and completely calm . '
But the clones are ' delicate and aggressive , ' she said .
In fact , she does not even own any of the clones .
In the time it took to reproduce Missy , she got another ' real ' dog , she said . "
Revived attempts to turn cloning into a commercial business are little more than money - making schemes designed to take advantage of pet lovers at the expense of animals .
AAVS will continue to take the lead in protecting animals from the threats of pet cloning and educating the public about the truth behind pet cloning .
We invite you to support our efforts and explore our website to learn more about the animal welfare problems , ethical concerns , deception , and lack of regulation associated with pet cloning .
An overwhelming 80 % of the public has stated its opposition to cloning companion animals such as cats and dogs , yet companies still try on occasion to make a business out of selling cloned pets and " banking " tissues from beloved pets for future cloning .
Pet cloning has been promoted as a way to " bring back " or " copy " a beloved companion animal .
However , attempts to clone pets represent little more than exaggerated claims and false promises .

После несколько формального прошлого вступления о поиске расскажу немного о
Google и себе .
Главное достоинство нашей компании – это люди .
Здесь собрано огромное количество победителей математических олимпиад и соревнований по программированию , да и просто много интересных людей .
Например , я тесно работаю с человеком , который стоял у основани я ЖЖ .
У меня самого хорошая школа успешных выступлений на международных соревнованиях ( школьных , студенческих , TopCoder , Google CodeJam 'ы и т.д. ) .
Пока я учился в
Киеве , даже успел поработать интерном в
Yahoo !
После окончания магистратуры пришлось выбирать между аспирантурой и работой в Google .
Совсем не жалею , что выбрал второе , ведь здесь столько возможностей для исследований и гораздо больше вычислительных ресурсов , чем в любом университете .
Кроме того , результатами моей работы могут пользоваться миллионы людей .
Наша группа , International Search Quality , отвечает за качество поиска на всех языках и во всех странах мира , включая , конечно же , русский .
Еще до прихода сюда , я всегда пользовался Google .
Да , Google тогда не учитывал морфологию русского языка , но все равно давал результаты лучше , чем другие , даже когда я искал на русском .
Сейчас же мы умеем обращаться с морфологией и знаем другие особенности русского .
Поэтому , когда это нужно , мы ищем не только слова из вашего запроса , но и их различные формы .
Реализовать морфологию было довольно просто , но традиционные подходы имеют множество недостатков .
Мы же выбираем алгоритмы , которые в первую очередь улучшают качество результатов реальных пользовательских запросов и избавляют вас как от необходимости набирать различные варианты одного запроса , так и от просмотра множества не интересующих вас страниц .
Мы постоянно изменяем и совершенствуем наши алгоритмы и пополняем арсенал трюков по обработке слов .
Например , традиционная реализация русской морфологии не поддерживает множество других полезных преобразований слов .
Теперь же , например , для запроса как лечить ожог будут также найдены страницы , содержащие лечение ожогов , для звон колокола - колокольный звон , для футбол английский чемпионат – чемпиона т
Англии по футболу , а для русификация ICQ - русификатор ICQ .
Также чрезмерное увлечение морфологией чаще вредит , чем помогает .
Поэтому мы стараемся использовать словоформы там и тогда , где это действительно нужно , и делать это как можно аккуратней .
Например , готов к войне не имеет отношения к запросу война с готами , ответом на вопрос кто такие таты будет явно не тату , а для запроса мыть кошку больше подойдет мытье кошек , чем моя кошка .
Кстати , вы всегда можете полностью отключить использование форм слова , поставив оператор + перед словом или взяв слово в кавычки .
Например , для запроса звон +колокола или звон " колокола " , будет найдено только точное вхождение слова колокола , а вот колокольный звон найден не будет .
Researchers at the Umeå Plant Science Centre at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences ( SLU ) , Sweden , report about a breakthrough in our understanding of how plants control their flowering .
In an article published in the international journal Science , Thursday 11th , they show how a small molecule that is formed in the plant leaves is transported to the shoot tips where it induces the formation of flowers .
This knowledge can lead to the development of new tools that can be used to control the timing of plant flowering , something that is of central importance in both agriculture and forestry .
We are all familiar with the fact that different plants flower at different times of the year .
Daffodils in spring , roses in summer and other plants in fall .
It is absolutely vital for the plant survival to flower at exactly the right time to secure that it can pollinate , or be pollinated , by other plants of the same species .
How then does the plant know when to flower ?
Intense Florigen hunt
Already in the 30 - ies scientists found out that plants can tell whether they are growing in spring , summer or fall by measuring the length of the day .
One could also show that plants use their leaves to sense the length of the day .
By grafting leaves from plants that had been induced to flower on non-induced plants one could show that the induced leaves produce a substance that is transported to the shoot tips where it induces the formation of flowers .
In the 30 - ies a Russian scientist called this mysterious substance " Florigen " .
During the following 70 years scientists have been involved in an intense hunt trying to find out the true nature of " Florigen " which has been described as something of a " Holy Grail " for plant physiology .
The reason is that the nature of " Florigen " is central for our understanding of how plant flowering is controlled .
All attempts to identify a single substance carrying the properties of " Florigen " have failed , until now .
Messenger molecule
A research group led by Professor Ove Nilsson at the Umeå Plant Science Centre at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences has now identified a " messenger molecule " that fulfills all the classical properties of Florigen .
A gene called " FT " produces the " messenger molecule " .
This gene is active in leaves and its activity is controlled by the length of the day .
When the gene is activated , a messenger molecule is produced that is transported to the shoot tips where it very efficiently induces the " gene programs " that control the formation of flowers .
These groundbreaking results are published " online " on Aug 11 in the international journal Science .
Together with other data published at the same time , it shows convincingly that the " messenger molecule " produced by FT either is florigen , or an important component of florigen .
The researchers have used the small plant model species Arabidopsis in their research .
But the group of Ove Nilsson has also other data showing that these results can be directly applied to other species , such as poplar trees .
Ove Nilsson says : " With the help of this knowledge plant breeders will get a new tool to control and adopt the flowering of plants , something that has been of great importance for agriculture but that can also lead to the development of efficient tree breeding for forestry " .

It looks like the Show - Me State is getting ready to join the growing coalition of states rejecting the RealID idea :
JEFFERSON CITY , Mo. ( AP ) â € ”
The Missouri House overwhelmingly voted Thursday to refuse to follow a federal law setting national standards for driverâ€™s licenses .
The federal Real ID
Act passed in 2005 after officials learned that some of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorists had obtained legitimate driverâ€™s licenses .
The law will link state records to a national database and set standard state licensing rules .
Supporters say the standards are needed to prevent terrorists and illegal immigrants from getting fake identification cards .
Rep. Jim Guest said the federal law is an invasion of privacy and could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars to comply .
He worries that a provision requiring licenses to contain â€˜â€ ˜common machine readable technologyâ€™â€™ could result in a Big Brother kind of system with the government able to track a personâ€™s every move through a computer chip .
â€˜â€
˜We must not lose what this nation was founded upon , â€™â€™ said Guest , R- King City .
â€˜â€ ˜The Real ID
Act is a direct frontal assault on our freedoms .

Was it virtue or betrayal ?

Potential Presidential Candidates for 2008 Campaign 2008 is already in full swing .
Who are the players ?
Below we look at some potential candidates , some of whom are ( semi - ) announced and some of whom are playing hard to get .
When looking at 2008 presidential candidates , always keep two things in mind .
First , every morning 100 U.S. senators look in the bathroom mirror and see a future president .
Many run , but only two sitting senators have ever been elected president : Warren Harding ( R - OH ) in 1920 and Jack Kennedy ( D - MA ) in 1960 .
The reason is clear : senators have to vote thousands of times and opponents can always dredge up some vote to batter them over the head with .
The problem is exacerbated by the intricacies of Senate procedures , where the key vote may be on the motion to table the motion to reconsider some proposal .
Note to senators : Both Harding and Kennedy died after serving for only 2 1/2 years .
Are you really sure you want the job ?
Second , people who vote in Republican primaries are to the right of the Republican Party and way right of mainstream America and people who vote in Democratic primaries are the left of the Democratic Party and way left of mainstream America .
As a consequence , candidates who might be able to win the general election are often disliked by primary voters as too centrist .
Politicans respond by talking fairly extreme during primary season and then ignoring what they said in the Spring during the Fall .
Count on it .
Also worth noting is that two years before the election , few people are tuned in and pollsters asking " Who would you like to win the Democratic Party nomination might as well be asking " Please name some Democrat . "
Ditto for the Republicans .
In 2002 , everyone was expecting Gore or Lieberman to be the Democratic nominee in 2004 .
Nobody saw the rise ( and fall ) of Howard Dean .
Worse yet , in the Spring of 1991 , Bill Clinton was in 11th place in the polls .
Nobody took him seriously .
As Harold Wilson famously remarked , : " In politics , a week is a long time . "

Democrats Candidate Notes
Hillary
Clinton
( D) Hillary Clinton scares the daylights out of BOTH parties .
The Democrats know that half the country hates her guts .
Part of the hatred is due to her being an " uppity woman , " part due to her being a calculating politician , and part due to her role in the health care debacle in Bill 's first term .
On the other hand , the Republicans know she can raise boatloads of money ( $ 90 million through Sept. 30 ) , more than they can , and they also know that her husband is without a doubt the best campaigner alive today .
Another strike against her is that to win , the Democrats have to do better in the South or the interior West and a senator from the Northeast is a tough sell there .
Still , with universal name recognition , a razor - sharp mind , and more cash than Uncle Scrooge , she 's the person to beat .
Candidate Notes
Barack
Obama
(D) Barack Obama is doing well in the early states , but a young ( 46 ) black freshman senator with no foreign policy experience is an inviting target for the Republicans .
Yes , Jack Kennedy was 43 in 1960 , but he had already served in Congress for 14 years and was a highly decorated naval hero in WWII ( but Lloyd Bentsen is dead so Obama need not fear him saying : Senator , you 're no Jack Kennedy ) .
Also instructive is what happened to Harold Ford , Jr. , another charismatic young black Democrat , in the recent Tennessee senatorial election .
The Republicans ran a now - infamous bimbo ad showing a sleazy blonde winking at Ford , and Ford suddenly tanked .
On the other hand , Obama raised a surprisingly large amount of money ( $ 80 million throug Sept. 30 ) .
Recent polls show him ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire .
If he can win both , he wo n't be home free , but will be a force to contend with .
Candidate Notes
John
Edwards
( D) John Edwards has a lot going for him .
He is well known , from the South , and knows how to run a national campaign .
He is also an extraordinarily good speaker and has a consistent message : preventing the country from dividing into the haves and the have nots .
For middle class people barely hanging on , his economic populism could have great appeal .
The death of his 16 - year son in an auto accident in 1996 and how he recovered from that trauma gives him some authenticity that other politicians lack .
Earlier this year he had a big lead in Iowa , but that has faded .
Still , Iowa polling is notoriously inaccurate and a win here might put him in contention .
Candidate Notes
Bill
Richardson
(D) To win the presidency , the Democrats have to do better in the South , the Lower Midwest , or the interior West .
Furthermore , governors do a lot better than senators .
Add to this the fact that Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic group in the country .
Enter Bill Richardson stage left , the Hispanic governor of New Mexico , who previously served in Congress , was ambassador to the United Nations , and was Bill Clinton 's Secretary of Energy .
Richardson 's mother is Mexican and he grew up in Mexico City , so he speaks fluent Spanish .
He just won reelection with 68 % of the vote , the largest gubernatorial win in the state 's history .
He is well - known in the region and a Richardson candidacy could potentially bring in New Mexico , Arizona , Nevada , and Colorado , all of which have sizeable and growing Hispanic populations .
On the down side , he is a boring speaker in two languages and does not seem to be going anywhere in the polls .
He might make a good Veep candidate though .
Candidate Notes
Chris
Dodd
( D) Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) has announced he is running for President .
Beats me why .
He does n't have the machine Hillary does , the charisma Obama does , the national campaign experience Edwards does , or the appeal to Western and Latino voters Richardson does .
Maybe he is running for Veep , but what does he bring to the ticket ?
Connecticut ?
With Dodd on the ticket , the Democrats will definitely win Connecticut .
However , without Dodd , they will also definitely win Connecticut .
I suppose it looks good on your resume : " Ran for President . "
Candidate Notes
Joe
Biden
(D) What is about the U.S. Senate that makes all its members run for President , no matter how microscopic their chances ?
While Chris Dodd has not a prayer of winning , Joe Biden has even less .
He ran for President in 1988 , but was forced out of the race when it was discovered that he had plagiarized a speech from the British politician Neil Kinnock .
Maybe this time he could try plagiarizing from a politician who speaks , say , Uyghur , since it will be less easily detected .
To make things worse , the day he announced , Biden said Barack Obama was " articulate , " which brought the entire punditry down on his head .
Joe should forget this nonsense and just concentrate on being a good senator .
Candidate Notes
Dennis
Kucinich
( D) Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , the boy wonder who was elected mayor of Cleveland at 31 , is running for President again , as he did in 2004 .
He has no chance of getting the Democratic nomination , which in his case is liberating .
Unlike the other candidates , who have to be respectful to everyone and all ideas , no matter how nutty , Kucinich just says what he thinks .
He is an unabashed old - school liberal and has a very detailed program he is running on , including immediate removal of all U.S. troops from Iraq , a single - payer health system for all Americans , legalizing same - sex marriage , and more .
His main problem is that with a real horse race this time between Hillary , Obama , and Edwards few Democrats are likely to make a protest vote for him when they actually have a real choice in influencing who the nominee is .
Nevertheless , his campaign will put some ideas on the table , however unpopular they may be in some quarters now .
Candidate Notes
Mike
Gravel
(D) Mike Gravel , the former senator from Alaska , is running for President to the left of Dennis Kucinich .
Gravel supports gay marriage , decriminalization of marijuana , federal financing of stem cell research , and similar positions that most candidates wo n't touch .
However , unlike Kucinich , who has a small but loyal core of followers , Gravel is almost totally unknown outside Alaska .
Republicans Candidate Notes
Rudy
Giuliani
( R) Rudy Giuliani scores well in national polls , but it is hard to imagine that he will get the Republican nomination , despite his excellent chances in the general election .
His past is his problem .
He married his second cousin , then 14 years later got an anullment when he discovered she was his cousin .
While married to his next wife , he had various widely publicized affairs .
Then he announced his divorce at a press conference -- before telling his wife -- and proceeded to make his girlfriend wife # 3 .
He has long been pro-choice , pro-gay , and pro gun control , and as mayor of New York , appointed many Democrats as municipal judges .
His longtime friend and business partner , Bernie Kerik , has been indicted , raising questions about Giuliani 's judgement .
Up until Thanksgiving , the Base did n't seem to have a candidate .
Now they may have found one in Mike Huckabee and Rudy is dropping like a stone .

( R) Mike Huckabee , born in Hope , Arkansas , just finished his second elected term as governor of his native state .
He is keenly aware that another Hope native who governed Arkansas went on to bigger and better things .
Huckabee used to be so fat that he could barely walk up the steps to his office .
His subsequent diagnosis of diabetes scared the daylights out of him and he lost over 100 pounds and wrote a book entitled " Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork .
As governor he has focused on health issues .
As an ordained Baptist minister from the South , he has a leg up on the competition , but as governor , he had to be pragmatic and is not the kind of firebrand many Republicans want .
Still , given how out of sync the rest of the field is with the Base , Huckabee might just pull it off .
Candidate Notes
John
McCain
( R) John McCain came into this race as the clear front runner , but in a few short months all that has changed .
All his strengths ( decorated Vietnam war hero , long record of achievement in Congress , maverick streak ) and all his weaknesses ( his age , divorce , three bouts of malignant melanoma , refusal to kowtow to Jerry Falwell then suddenly kowtowing to Jerry Falwell ) hardly mattered any more .
Like no other candidate , he is Mr. Iraq .
He has firmly attached himself to the war and the " surge . "
Furthermore , the Base hates him for his principled stands on tax cuts , campaign finance , and immigration .
Nevertheless , do n't count McCain out .
As Charlie Cook put it , Rudy Giuliani has more baggage than a Samsonite warehouse , Mitt Romney has yet to hit 10 % in the polls , Huckabee does n't seem to be doing that well in New Hampshire , and Fred Thompson is a big disappointment .
McCain might win under the slogan " None of the above . "
Candidate Notes
Mitt
Romney
( R) Mitt Romney is the son of former Michigan governor and failed presidential candidate George Romney .
Romney is pro business and moderately conservative .
However , he has three major problems .
First , he was a 1 - term governor of Massachusetts , a state not known for launching the careers of conservative Republicans .
Second , he is a Mormon , and unfortunately many evangelicals do n't like Mormons on theological grounds .
Third , when running for governor of Massachusetts , he took many liberal positions that are slowly leaking out .
He has raised a lot of money , but his support seems to be moving to Huckabee in Iowa and possibly elsewhere .
Candidate Notes
Fred
Thompson
( R) Fred Thompson announced very late , but quickly jumped to second place in the polls then fell back .
He has a certain amount of baggage ( getting his girlfriend pregnant in high school , working as a lobbyist for cigarette companies and foreign governments , etc. ) but that all seems insignificant to his lackluster style of campaigning .
He does n't seem to really want the job and that shows .
People expect a presidential candidate to be ambitious and Thompson is not .
On the positive side , if he gets wiped off the map quickly , he probably wo n't care .
Candidate Notes
Ron
Paul
( R) Ron Paul is a Texas congressman who is running for President as a Republican although he ran for President on the Libertarian ticket in 1988 and came in third with over 400,000 votes .
He still has very libertarian views and routinely votes against almost all bills that raise taxes or increase government spending .
His libertarian views often irk his Republican colleagues .
For example , he is pro life , and is thus against capital punishment as well as abortion , the latter not entirely surprising since Paul is a gynecolegist who has delivered 4000 babies .
He is also against a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage saying it is none of the federal government 's business who you marry .
As a doctor , he supports the medical use of marijuana , again saying the federal government should not be telling doctors which drugs to prescribe .
He has raised a huge amount of money from grass roots libertarian activists .
He is a real phenomenon , but is the longest of longshots to win the nomination .
Candidate Notes
Duncan
Hunter
( R) To say that Duncan Hunter , the congressman from CA - 52 just north of San Diego , is a long shot has to be the understatement of the year .
For him to be nominated , would require half a dozen much more serious candidates to collapse .
It ai n't gonna happen .

He ’s also looking for green nuclear engineers , and says he feels guilty that he and his fellow environmentalists created so much fear of nuclear power .
Alternative energy and conservation are fine steps to reduce carbon emissions , he says , but now nuclear power is a proven technology working on a scale to make a serious difference .
“ There were legitimate reasons to worry about nuclear power , but now that we know about the threat of climate change , we have to put the risks in perspective , ” he says .
“ Sure , nuclear waste is a problem , but the great thing about it is you know where it is and you can guard it .
The bad thing about coal waste is that you do n’t know where it is and you do n’t know what it ’s doing .
The carbon dioxide is in everybody ’s atmosphere . ”
Mr. Brand predicts that his heresies will become accepted in the next decade as the scientific minority in the environmental movement persuades the romantic majority .
He still considers himself a member of both factions , just as in the days of the Merry Pranksters , but he ’s been shifting toward the minority .
“ My trend has been toward more rational and less romantic as the decades go by , ” he says .
“ I keep seeing the harm done by religious romanticism , the terrible conservatism of romanticism , the ingrained pessimism of romanticism .
It builds in a certain immunity to the scientific frame of mind . ”
Mr. Brand got his first look at the big picture one afternoon in 1966 while sitting on a roof in San Francisco at what he calls an “ altitude of three stories and 100 mikes , ” meaning micrograms of LSD .
He contemplated the skyline and decided the buildings were n’t parallel because he was seeing the curvature of the Earth .
This reminded him of Buckminster Fuller ’s theory that people abused the environment because they thought of the Earth as flat and infinite , not as a finite globe .
The next day the Earth looked flat again , but the 28 - year - old Mr. Brand had a new cause .
He printed up buttons asking , “ Why have n’t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet ? ”
Starting a small business is never easy .
Every day will bring new challenges , but also new rewards .
Before you can get that far , however , you have to secure funding to get the business started .
The difficulty of this will depend on a lot of factors ; for example , what your idea is , the amount of collateral you have , and your credit score are just a few of the things involved .
Fortunately , there are many good sources for small business startup money .
This guide looks at some of those sources and gives you the basic information you need about them .
Coupon Websites
From project management software to office equipment , small business ’ budget can be eaten up quickly .
By using coupon codes freely available on sites like the CouponFeed website , you can save hundreds or even thousands on on your business ’ expenses .
Sometimes saving money is as important as earning money .
Venture Capital
Venture capital is high - risk , high - potential small business startup money .
The venture capitalist makes money from the loan by owning equity in your business .
It is a form of private equity and does not have the same requirements as a bank to be eligible for the money .
This form of funding can be easier to obtain than others , especially if your business relates to technology or healthcare , as those are prosperous fields .
It is ideal if your startup is too small to raise money in the public markets or cannot secure a bank loan .
The downside is that a venture capitalist owns a part of your company until they sell their holdings .
Angel Investors
Angel investors are people with the financial ability to get your business started .
Unlike a bank , these investors do not make themselves known to the general public .
You have to know how to find them .
You need to find one that shares your passion for the business , and some of your moral and social values as well .
It is vital that you have a connection with the investor so that they feel comfortable loaning you money .
To help find them , share your startup idea with people that you trust .
Find out if they know anyone that might be willing to invest in your small business .
Grant Competitions
Every year , large organizations hold various competitions for startup money for small businesses .
One of them is Intuit ’s “ Love a Local Business ” competition .
Each year there is a different prize , such as a $ 25,000 grant for hiring employees .
There are other grant competitions available , including form FedEx , Life123 , and Miller Urban .
You can find all the details , including restrictions , requirements , and prizes , on each company ’s website .
Friends and Family
If you are trying to avoid borrowing money from a bank , you may be able to get enough funds to begin through relatives and close friends .
For many entrepreneurs , this is a frequent source of funding for their small business .
On the positive side , you will be getting money from people who support you and share your visions for your business .
On the downside , if you cannot pay them back , it can damage or destroy your relationships with them .
Before you approach family or friends for money , make sure that you have a business plan to show them , including a repayment schedule , with interest , for money that is loaned to you .
Securing small business startup money is not as easy as it used to be .
That does not mean you cannot succeed , but it means you will have to be thorough .
There is really no such thing as “ free money ” in business .
One way or another , you must pay for the capital you receive , either by repaying loans or offering stock .
Starting a business is almost a business in itself , because there are many regulations to follow and decisions to make .
Once you receive funding , you will take the next big step toward making your dream a reality .
“ WATER is to Coca - Cola as clean energy is to BP . ”
So declares Jeff Seabright , Coca - Cola 's manager of environmental affairs , when asked about the firm 's new global water strategy .
The fizzy - drinks maker unveiled that strategy as part of its annual environmental report , released this week .
“ We need to manage this issue or it will manage us , ” says Mr Seabright .
At first sight , the analogy with oil may seem odd , but it is not so far - fetched .
Big
Oil has long been the target of activists clamouring for action on global warming .
BP stole a march on its oily brethren by accepting that climate change is a real problem , making smallish investments in clean energy , and grandly proclaiming itself “ beyond petroleum ” .
Coca - Cola has also been targeted by activists , but over the issue of water rather than energy .
The firm has been hit hardest in India .
First , experts from Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment , a green think - tank , tested various soft drinks and determined that they contained high levels of pesticide .
It turned out that Coca - Cola was not the cause of the problem .
But its inept handling of the accusations left the firm exposed to a much more damaging allegation : that it is aggravating the growing global problem of fresh - water scarcity .
An ongoing controversy in India concerns allegations that some of the firm 's bottling plants use too much water in drought - prone areas , thus leaving poor local villagers with too little .
Amit Srivastava of the India Resource Centre , a Californian non-governmental group , has been using the Indian controversies to stoke an international grass - roots campaign against Coca - Cola .
The firm brags that it operates in 200 countries — “ more than the UN itself ” , says Mr Seabright .
But Coca - Cola 's global reach and iconic status make it an easy target .
Mr Srivastava points with glee to recent decisions at a handful of university campuses in America and Britain to suspend or challenge its contracts on ethical grounds .
Worse may be in store , if some have their way .
Corporate Accountability International ( CAI ) , an activist group best known for organising a noisy boycott of Nestlé ( for selling infant milk powder in countries without reliable access to clean water ) , now has its sights set on the world 's largest producer of non-alcoholic drinks .
CAI turned up at Coca - Cola 's last shareholder meeting to grill the firm 's management over the water issue .
Kathryn Mulvey , CAI 's boss , is concerned not only about its fizzy - drinks divisions but also its newish and booming bottled - water business .
Echoing the sentiments of other campaigners , she insists that the “ misleading marketing campaign ” for the bottled water needlessly undermines confidence in tap water , and amounts to the “ commodification of something that should not be bought and sold . ”
Company officials argue that they started measuring and improving their use of water long before its troubles in India .
The firm improved its water efficiency by 6 % between 2003 and 2004 .
In 2002 , it took 3.12 litres of water to produce one litre of final product ( as much water is used to clean the assembly lines , flush out glass bottles , and so on ) .
In 2004 , that global average came down to 2.72 litres .
Mr Srivastava is not impressed : he grouses that it is “ ridiculous that a firm that calls itself a ‘ hydration company ' should waste so much water ; most of it does not even end up in the product . ”
To improve that situation , Coca - Cola has just completed a detailed assessment of the “ water risks ” to its businesses and their local communities .
Going plant by plant , the firm 's boffins have calculated local water - scarcity ratios , depletion levels for local aquifers , water needs for the local plant , and so on .
With this new information , the firm is now setting local targets for improving each plant 's efficiency of water and energy use .
Mr Seabright explains that before this new study , the firm tried to impose “ one - size - fits - all ” global targets which local bottlers ( who are often not owned by Coca - Cola ) refused to accept .
Coca -Cola is also working with non-governmental groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and CARE , as well as UN agencies , in an effort to burnish its image .
In India , it is now promising to capture enough water via “ rainwater harvesting ” ( an age - old technique for capturing monsoon run-off ) to offset all of its water use by 2006 .
Even the deeply sceptical Mr Srivastava concedes that “ if this company were really not to put any strain on local resources then it would be a different matter .
Let us see if this is just greenwash . ”
The accusation of “ greenwash ” — environmental window - dressing as a front for business - as - usual — has also been hurled at BP .
But there the similarities between Coca - Cola and BP end , for the question of water is far more important to Coca - Cola than the issue of climate change is to BP .
That is because if oil and gas run out , or are deemed too dirty to use one day , BP could still peddle ethanol or hydrogen fuel ; it is , in the end , an energy company .
Coca - Cola , on the other hand , simply would not exist without water .
So while BP may yet see life beyond petroleum , Coca - Cola will never get Beyond Water .
This is the first in a series of unsolicited photo critiques ( see introduction ) .
This photo , Jessica , Tomsu Cleaners , is by Dan Loflin .
I love this guy ’s work , and he ’s made heaps of other interesting images , but this is a recent one that grabbed me .
Take a good , long look .
This one ’s better if you let it unfold yourself .
( Paraphrasing and expanding on the comment I left on the photo on Flickr : )
What I love about this is that it ’s creeper weird .
I look at it for a while .
I see a pretty normal - looking scene , though it ’s something you ’re more likely to see in person rather than in a photo .
Great lighting .
There ’s something a little uncomfortable about the framing .
My eye wants to see the camera moved a bit to the right to eliminate the door frame and include the rest of the cash register .
Then I ’m glad he did n’t do that , because the subtle tension makes it feels like a real , active space that forces me to take in the whole thing rather than allowing me to snap to an immediate and pat parsing of " woman , cash register " , making a bunch of assumptions , and walking away .
Great depth of field choice , it really complements the framing by letting each the foreground and background play their parts .
Then it starts to dawn on me : there ’s an undercurrent here , a vaguely unsettling but quickly growing feeling .
Then it ’s a frying pan to the face .
I really see her hands for the first time .
They ’re acting out their own fitful play while the rest of her is trying to go about her business .
She seems interrupted , good - humored and maybe a little self - conscious , but her hands seem undeterred .
It seems like Loflin ’s given us a window into a long continuum of conflict and looks like a disturbingly precise portrait of functional OCD .
To me , this is a very understated but incredibly powerful decisive moment .
It ’s not necessarily immediately accessible — it was n’t to me , anyway — but I think that ’s part of this photo ’s strength .
I like art that makes me work for it a little and participate .
In music , there ’s the concept of an " envelope " , which describes the shape of a sound , and is broken into four components : attack ( how quickly a sound reaches its full volume ) , decay ( how much quieter it gets over how long a period ) , sustain ( how long that quieter bit maintains a plateau level ) , and release ( how quickly it fades out ) .
The same applies to flavors in cooking and the emotional experience of looking at art for me .
Not something to be quantitatively evaluated and used to judge work , but I ’ve found it to be a useful framework for describing the rides , or plot arcs , that these things take me on .
Some photos , mostly those that rely on an effect over actual substance , give it all up too quickly .
OK , you cross processed it , shot it with a pinhole or a Lomo , have a really shallow or huge depth of field , have a great tonal range , made a cyanotype , whatever , it makes an immediate and striking impression .
But if you ’re not saying or creating anything with that stuff beyond the effect , you ’ve got nothing left after half a second .
It grabs your attention but then does n’t do anything with it .
This is why de-fatted foods taste like shit : fat masks flavor and spreads its release out over a longer period of time .
Without the fat , all the flavor compounds are released and processed right at the beginning , giving you a fast initial hit but leaving you a mouthful of tasteless crap to deal with .
There ’s no flavorless crap in this photo .
It draws me in with good compositional decisions , hintingly unfolds a little , ramps up quickly , punches me in the face , lets me hang out for a minute to put it all together , and then fades out , like having your head inside a struck bell that never quite stops vibrating .
Chewing satisfaction goes on and on .

How to Beat Rails
December 31 , 2006 at 10:17 pm
( Note : I really , really like Ruby and Rails .
Anything disparaging that I say about either of them should be taken with several grains of salt .
If I seem to be encouraging Pythoneers to crush Rails , it ’s simply because I love both , and want all frameworks to be constantly innovating . )
Everybody with the slightest interest in web development has heard of Ruby on Rails .
It thrust Ruby into the spotlight , created a hype machine that stubbornly refuses to go away , and made David Heinemeier Hansson a celebrity .
I adore Rails – it ’s by far the best web framework for simple CRUD apps .
However , as a Python devotee , it hurt me deeply to see Ruby stealing the spotlight .
As such , I embarked on a quest to find out why Rails is winning ; I looked at Django , Turbogears , Pylons and web.py .
After months of building the same simple CRUD app , I came to the following conclusion :
Python can beat Rails .
It can grind it into a pulp in every way concievable – speed , elegance , coolness , extensiblity , organization , AJAXness , beauty , and flexibility .
It can send Rails crying home to David while Guido basks in the Web 2.0 spotlight .
But right now , Rails is thoroughly torching all of the Python web frameworks .
The following is a list of recommendations that , if applied to a Python framework , could dislodge Rails from the position of King of the Web Frameworks .
Section 1 : The Model
Use SQLAlchemy .
In case you have n’t heard of this amazing Python library , it ’s a phenomenally slick layer on top of SQL which provides all the power of SQL wrapped inside the elegance that is Python .
The advanced features it offers blow SQLObject out of the water , the documentation is top - notch , the user community is active , it supports a vast number of types of databases , and it has a remarkably extensible plugin architecture .
Fix SQLAlchemy ’s configuration .
Unfortunately , SQLAlchemy is fundamentally broken in a number of ways .
Firstly , it ’s difficult to set up – any web framework that uses SA should make sure that the programmer can ignore the tedium that is setting up a session correctly , what with SessionObjects , contexts and metadata .
Kudos to Turbogears for making that part easy .
Use SQLAlchemy declarative layers .
SQLAlchemy ’s table declaration code is very verbose compared to that of SQLObject or ActiveRecord ; libraries like ActiveMapper or TurboEntity allow SA tables to be declared like Python objects , a la SQLObject .
TurboEntity is cool in that it makes many - to - many relationships easy and allows for inheritance .
Alternatively , a visual table designer could be cool ( as long as the generated code was n’t too hideous ) .
Support database schema migrations .
One of the things that makes ActiveRecord a joy to use is its database migration system ; if I make a mistake , I should be able to roll back changes without nuking my entire database .
There is already a project in the works to support migrations inside SQLAlchemy ; making sure that migrations play nicely with the aforementioned tools for declarative mapping will probably be quite difficult – yet I am sure that the smart cookies in the Python community are up for it .
Section 2 : The View
Use Django templates .
They are easy to learn , they do n’t lock you into writing XHTML ( sorry , Genshi ! ) , and they provide everything a templating system should have .
Make Ajax integration easy .
Turbogears does this brilliantly with MochiKit ; Django does n’t do this at all .
However , Rails still beats them both with Script.aculo.us tools .
Use Turbogears widgets .
I ’ll let you on to a little secret of mine – I do n’t like writing HTML .
I find CSS , div’s , span ’s , stylesheets , and all the other HTML miscellany to be a pain in the ass .
Turbogears has widgets – Python objects designed to produce specific kinds of HTML , such as a grid for displaying data ; these allow me to knock together very slick interfaces very quickly .
The ToscaWidgets project aims to allow the use of Turbogears widgets in any framework ; however , I could n’t get it to work .
Section 3 : The Controller
Use CherryPy 3 . CherryPy will be immediately familiar to those who have worked with Rails .
Add on the fact that its WSGI server is really fast , and we have a winner .
Use the routing systems of Pylons and Django .
Yes , Pylons ’ routing system pretty much a direct copy of Rails ’ routes.rb system .
So what ?
Rails got routing right .
However , I feel that Django ’s lends itself to prettier URL ’s – as such , make the Pylons one the default , with the option of using Django ’s one .
Use FormEncode for validation .
One of my biggest pet peeves with Rails is that sometimes the validation can be very inflexible – I had a lot of trouble with trying to tell Rails just to ignore any dollar signs entered in certain text fields .
FormEncode is far more flexible .
Section 4 : Miscellany
Use Python 2.5 .
Even if you ’re keeping backwards compatibility , my application should n’t break with mounds of gibberish for an error code ( I ’m looking at you , Turbogears ) when I forget to tell it to use Python 2.4 .
Use Django ’s admin interface .
It ’s slick , functional , and easy – keep it .
Have Django ’s userauth system at the ready .
Rails does n’t have a built - in userauth system ; if we put one in , we ’ll have an immediate advantage .
The Turbogears Toolbox is crucial .
Having a mini-app that displays all the availiable Ajax features and widgets is invaluable – it saves hours digging through documentation and out - of - date tutorials .
Have the Django people write the documentation .
The documentation and tutorials for Django are the best out of any web framework ; good documentation is crucial if you want people to stick with a framework .
Learn from Turbogears ’ extensibility .
Using easy_install to add another Turbogears widget makes it show up in the Turbogears toolbox ; a good Python web framework needs to be just as extensible .
Rails engines do n’t do the job entirely right , as they sometimes generate code that clutters up the main application – newly installed packages should be seamless .
Have Unicode support .
Python ’s Unicode support is second only to Java ( in which every string is Unicode ) ; use this built - in advantage over Ruby in order to get a jump on Rails .
Get the publicity machine going .
DHH is the best software evangelist since Larry Wall ; we need someone similarly charismatic and outspoken in order to push any new Python software .
Make CRUD apps really easy .
We need to learn from Streamlined and the Ajax scaffold generator .
( Now that I think about it , extending the Django admin interface would take care of this . )
This has turned into a far longer post than I would have expected .
Thanks for reading it ; let me know what you think .

President Bush ’s job - approval rating has fallen to its lowest mark of his presidency , according to a new Harris Interactive poll .
Of 1,003 U.S. adults surveyed in a telephone poll , 29 % think Mr. Bush is doing an “ excellent or pretty good ” job as president , down from 35 % in April and significantly lower than 43 % in January . [… ]
Researchers at Akishima Laboratories ( Mitsui Zosen ) , working in conjunction with professor Shigeru Naito of Osaka University , have developed a device that uses waves to draw text and pictures on the surface of water .
The device , called AMOEBA ( Advanced Multiple Organized Experimental Basin ) , consists of 50 water wave generators encircling a cylindrical tank 1.6 meters in diameter and 30 cm deep ( about the size of a backyard kiddie pool ) .
The wave generators move up and down in controlled motions to simultaneously produce a number of cylindrical waves that act as pixels .
The pixels , which measure 10 cm in diameter and 4 cm in height , are combined to form lines and shapes .
AMOEBA is capable of spelling out the entire roman alphabet , as well as some simple kanji characters .
Each letter or picture remains on the water surface only for a moment , but they can be produced in succession on the surface every 3 seconds .
Researchers at Akishima Laboratories have developed similar devices in the past that used waves to draw pictures on the surface of water , but those devices had trouble producing letters with straight lines ( such as the letter K ) .
Additionally , it took the previous devices up to 15 minutes of data input time to produce each letter .
The newly developed technology uses improved calculation methods for controlling the wave generators , relying on formulas known as Bessel functions .
In addition to being able to draw letters consisting of straight lines , the input time has been drastically reduced to between 15 and 30 seconds for each letter .
Akishima Laboratories expects the technology to be incorporated into amusement devices that combine acoustics , lighting and fountain technology , which they hope to see installed at theme parks and hotels .
====================
UPDATE Dec 27 , 2006 : Check out this short video of AMOEBA in action , from the World Business Satellite ( WBS ) news program ( props to Seihin World ) .
AMOEBA forms the letters " WBS " on the water surface .

Here is an extremely well - done Wii video , that you might take for an official Nintendo commercial until the , say , last 3 seconds .
I caught up with the creator from Super 78 ( a professional CGI movie company ) and this is what he had to say about the clip :
I really love the Wii and I had been reading these stories about Wii controllers flying out of peoples hands .
We had some down time at the office so I got together with one of the animators and I sketched out a storyboard of the spot .
In the board the controller is this high energy maniac and the nun-chuck just wants to get away .
So our most talented animator Michael Smith created this fun spot there is a lot of character ... This was done by us , Super 78 , using our own resources , no agency was involved , no money changed hands .
I am hoping that you could post it so we can see if it catches fire .

Down time at the office ?
I could use some help on these posts , you know , when you are n't making kick ass Wiimovies .

In the State of the Union message this past week , the President gave , as part of his solution to the increasing problems of gasoline supply , an increasing emphasis on ethanol .
There has been some considerable debate about whether this will work , but I thought I would follow a couple of different thoughts today .
The first relates to what the farmers might be doing in order to benefit from this coming bonanza , and the second is to see how much research is actually being done .
Estimates of the long - run potential for ethanol production can be made by calculating the corn price at which the incentive to expand ethanol production disappears .
Under current ethanol tax policy , if the prices of crude oil , natural gas , and distillers grains stay at current levels , then the break - even corn price is $ 4.05 per bushel .
A multi-commodity , multi-country system of integrated commodity models is used to estimate the impacts if we ever get to $ 4.05 corn .
At this price , corn - based ethanol production would reach 31.5 billion gallons per year , or about 20 % of projected U.S. fuel consumption in 2015 .
Supporting this level of production would require 95.6 million acres of corn to be planted .
Total corn production would be approximately 15.6 billion bushels , compared to 11.0 billion bushels today .
Most of the additional corn acres come from reduced soybean acreage .
Wheat markets would adjust to fulfill increased demand for feed wheat .
What I found interesting about that statement ( the full report is available as a pdf ) was the remark about where the corn would come from .
And on the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words , I found this within another pdf presentation , that had some interesting numbers .
Looking around for some information ( thanks to Google ) I came across the Food and Policy Research Institute which is a joint program between the Universities of Iowa and Missouri .
It makes projections each year on the future development of the markets , and since it is located in the Midwest , it seemed a good starting place to look at what might be going to happen in the corn business .
Interestingly in their latest report on ethanol the number that they project for ethanol production is not that different from the President ’s ( 35 billion gallons ) .
What it shows is that the Institute does not see a significant change in the amount of acreage that will be planted , as the following table also shows , through the next few years .
Now what this is going to do to our export market for grain does not likely bode well for those folks down in Mexico worried about the rising price of tortillas , though it may encourage more local production .
The presentation also had a bioconversion chart , that may be useful , so I am including this also .
Now if corn can thus increase the amount of ethanol to close to what the President needs , one presumes that the remaining 10 % or so of new production will come from ethanol produced from a cellulosic source .
The Government plan for cellulosic research came from a workshop held in 2005 , following which DoE published a roadmap for research to meet the goals .
Doe has a special Biomass Program .
It is interesting to see where the program is investing .
There are two efforts at National Labs , one at PNNL , which is the Pacific Northwest National Lab located at Hanford in Washington State .
Interestingly one of their projects is with UOP , and I did hear a rumor the other day that UOP were one of the partners in the award from DARPA on the jet fuel from biomass program – we will see .
The other National Lab that gets significant funding is the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , although that program does not look quite as large , it also houses the National BioEnergy Center .
Under partnership with the Department of Agriculture there is also a Biomass Research and Development Initiative
The projects they finded last year ( for a total of $ 17 million ) were :
One thing struck me , going through to try and find this information , and it was that there are not a whole lot of different programs that are easy to find .
Now I know that there is some private research going on ( Vinod Khosla springs to mind ) , but if we are to put some $ 1.8 billion into this program , one would have thought that there would have been a bit of a stronger research base on which to properly invest to get the needed results in the time available .
I guess one will have to wait and see where the money actually gets spent .
Back in August the Government had announced that they will spend $ 250 million on two BioEnergy Research Centers
U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) Secretary Samuel W. Bodman announced today that DOE will spend $ 250 million to establish and operate two new Bioenergy Research Centers to accelerate basic research on the development of cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels .
The Secretary made the announcement with Congressman Jerry Weller ( IL - 11th ) , local officials and biofuels stakeholders during a visit to Channahon , IL . . . . . . .
Universities , national laboratories , nonprofit organizations and private firms are eligible to compete for an award to establish and operate a center .
Awards , based on evaluation by scientific peer review , will be announced next summer .
The centers are expected to begin work in 2008 and will be fully operational by 2009 .
The centers ’ mission will be to conduct systems biology research on microbes and plants , with the goal of harnessing nature ’s own powerful mechanisms for producing energy from sunlight .
A major focus will be on understanding how to reengineer biological processes for more efficient conversion of plant fiber , or cellulose , into ethanol , a substitute for gasoline .
The only problems I have with this effort is that it concentrates the funding rather than spreading it among a larger number of investigators , thereby limiting the number of fresh ideas that will be developed ( one occasionally gets the idea that the federal view on innovation is that it was n’t invented at MIT or some such place it has little promise ) , and secondly , given the length of time it is going to take to establish these centers , it is unlikely to have any impact at all on the current production plans .

Political pressure has finally seen the price of antiretroviral therapy for HIV slashed in poorer countries .
But a lack of cheap , simple diagnostics to enable doctors to use these complex treatments remains a stumbling block .
Now scientists from two New York universities believe they have the solution : a hand - held sensor that checks the health of a patient 's immune system in seconds .
At the moment it can take a week to get the same results back from the lab , " and that 's if they do n't get lost " , says Glenda Gray , a consultant physician and head of perinatal HIV research at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , South Africa .
The sensor measures the quantity of key immune cells called CD4 + cells in the blood .
A gradual depletion of CD4 + cells , which orchestrate the immune response to tumours and infections , is a sure sign that HIV is damaging a person 's health : some clinical definitions of AIDS say that once a person 's CD4 + count falls below 200 cells per microlitre of blood , he or she has developed the condition .
Doctors rely on CD4 + measurements to decide when to start drug treatments and to gauge whether a patient is responding to them .
To make the device , researchers from Cornell University in Ithaca and the University at Albany coated electrodes with antibodies specific to CD4 + cells .
When a small sample of blood is put onto a chip bearing these electrodes , the antibodies grab hold of the CD4 + cells .
The captured cells then impede the flow of current across the electrodes , allowing the density of CD4 + cells to be calculated .
To check that only CD4 + cells were sticking to the electrodes the team added a label to blood samples consisting of a fluorescent dye tagged to a further set of antibodies specific for CD4 + cells .
They then used an electron microscope to check which cells had been captured .
By counting the captured cells , the researchers devised a scale linking electrical resistance with the density of cells in the blood ( Biosensors & Bioelectronics , vol 21 , p 696 ) .
" It is the first step towards a hand - held , simple , inexpensive device that will measure the number of CD4 + cells in human blood without the need for extensive infrastructure , " says James Turner , a biophysicist at the University at Albany , who led the research .

This week it was the Senate ’s turn .
Like the House last week and the voters last November , the Senate made clear Tuesday that Americans expect to see the disaster in Iraq brought to an early and responsible end .
President Bush ’s reaction was instantaneous , familiar in its contempt for views that do not follow his in lockstep , and depressing in its lack of contact with reality .
Mr. Bush threatened to veto the spending bill needed for this year ’s military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan rather than accept language calling for most American combat troops to be withdrawn from Iraq sometime next year .
Nor was there any hint of his own prescription for ending this war .
Mr. Bush , his advisers and his loyalists on Capitol Hill threw up a cloud of propaganda aimed at making Americans think there is a debate going on between those who want to win the war and those who want to lose .
That ’s nonsense , and the White House knows it .
Mr. Bush ’s inadequate response was a cynical attempt to portray the Democrats and moderate Republicans who voted with the majority as indifferent to the political future of Iraq and to the morale of American soldiers stationed there .
In truth , it is Mr. Bush who has been defaulting on his own responsibilities in both areas , and that is why Congress needed to add the language he now objects to so vehemently .

This is the story of how the UK banking system could have collapsed in the early 1990s , but for the forbearance of a junior barrister who also happened to be an expert in computer law - and who discovered that at that time the computing department of one of the banks issuing ATM cards had " gone rogue " , cracking PINs and taking money from customers ' accounts with abandon .
The reason you 're hearing it now is that , with Chip and PIN cards finally in widespread use in the UK , the risk of the ATM network being abused as it was has fallen away .
And now that junior barrister , Alistair Kelman , wanted to get paid for thousands of pounds of work that he did under legal aid , when he was running a class action on behalf of more than 2,000 people who had suffered " phantom withdrawals " from their bank accounts .
What you 're about to read comes from the documents he submitted last week to the High Court , pursuing his claim to payment .
" Phantom withdrawals " were a big mystery when the banks and building societies began to join their ATM networks together in the 1980s .
Kelman at that time was a barrister ( who argues cases in front of a judge , rather than only slogging away in legal chambers ) specialising in intellectual property law .
He got interested in computing in the 1980s when the National Computing Centre asked him to advise the Midland Bank on its computer system .
What quickly became clear was that the law needed a system to provide proof that events had happened so that legal cases could be made .
You might say that " the computer debited the account " , but to a barrister ( and more importantly , a judge ) that 's not enough .
Did the computer do it at random ?
In that case it 's like a tree branch falling - an accident .
Or did a person program it to do so ?
In which case the person must be able to testify about the precise circumstances when a debit could happen .
Sounds daft , but the law rests on proving each step of an argument irrefutably .
In February 1992 Kelman got a call from Sheila MacKenzie , head of the Consumers ' Association ( which publishes Which ? magazine ) , who said that members were complaining by the dozen about phantom withdrawals , and was he interested ?
Kelman was , and met MacKenzie , with two of the association 's members , Mr and Mrs McConville from Liverpool , who had had a number of phantom withdrawals from their Barclays account .
They already had a solicitor , but needed someone with computer expertise in the law to make their case .
Kelman at this time was able to charge £ 1,750 per hour - each hour being broken into six - minute chunks .
Oh , and do n't forget VAT too .
That 's £ 206.62 per six minutes .
He showed his value pretty quickly , pointing out that banks must have a legal mandate to debit someone 's account .
If they take it away from a customer without a mandate , they must refund it .
So the legal point of phantom withdrawals hinged on the question : if a PIN is typed into an ATM with a card that matches an account number , is that a mandate by the customer for the bank to debit their account ?
As long as you did n't breach the terms of the contract by leaving your card lying around ( which would give implicit authority for use ) , then you , as the customer , could simply say that the withdrawal was not mandated , and demand your cash back .
How could the banks respond ?
They'd have to give all the phantom withdrawal money back where they could not show that the customer had typed in the PIN - unless , that is , they claimed that their systems were infallible .
Yes , only by going where no computer system had ever gone before could the banks deny that phantom withdrawals were ( 1 ) taking place and ( 2 ) their responsibility to refund .
You 'd think it would be open and shut .
You have n't dealt much with banks , have you ?
Kelman took the case on legal aid and decided to bundle up more than 2,000 peoples ' cases into a single class action against all the high street banks taking part in the ATM network .
He trawled newsgroups for information on how crackers might decode ATM cards .
He also met two key people in the course of his research .
The first , early on , was Andrew Stone , an ex-con who had been done for fraud , who claimed to had taken £ 750,000 from ATMs by combining techniques such as shoulder - surfing and grabbing receipts from ATMs ( which in those days often had the full account number on them ) .
Stone - who was soon back in prison - was proof in himself that criminals could make " phantom " withdrawals .
Professor Ross Anderson , a cryptography and security expert who was an expert consultant to Kelman on the case , explains : " Stone had been working with building access systems using cards with magnetic stripes , and one day he thought he'd see what it could read of his ATM card .
Then he tried it with his wife 's . "
Stone figured that the stream of digits was probably an encrypted PIN .
" Then , because you can change the content of the magnetic strip , he wondered what would happen if he changed the number on his card to match his wife 's .
He found he could get money out using his old PIN . "
The high street bank Stone used ( The Register knows which one ) had not used the account number to encrypt the PIN on the card - meaning that any card for that bank could be changed and used to make withdrawals on any other account in it , providing you knew the right details ( such as branch sort code and account number .
The name of the card holder of course was unimportant , because it was not on the stripe . )
" After that , " says Professor Anderson , " it was just a question for Stone of collecting as many account numbers as he could . "
Until the police caught up with him , at least .
In September 1992 Kelman met a woman he called the " Lotus Lady " , because she worked for Lotus at a time when he was considering buying some groupware to organise the rapidly - growing class action ; he had already put the names and other details of all the litigants into a relational database to search for patterns in victims and withdrawals .
The Lotus Lady was interesting because her ATM card did n't debit her account .
It gave her money , but heaven knew where from .
Kelman thought for a moment and realised that there must be thousands of such cards - and after a little more thought , how it had happened .
How could there be thousands of such cards ?
Because the chances of any two random people meeting in the UK population at that time were 25 million to 1 .
For one of them to have the only card in existence that debited other peoples ' accounts was absurd .
He 'd been on the case for six months , met - say - 3,000 people through it - and one of them had such a card .
The odds only work if thousands of people are walking around with cards like that , or potentially could be .
They had the wrong magnetic stripe on the card : the front was embossed with the holder 's details , but the account and PIN encrypted on the stripe pointed somewhere else .
How would n't that be spotted ?
Simple : dummy accounts .
To do their testing in an environment where the bank systems had to work all the time , the computing teams set up a parallel universe of dummy banks , dummy branches and dummy accounts .
But they generated real ATM cards for them , and could take out real money - authorised by the banks .
Some people were getting dummy cards .
But equally , Kelman saw , it would be possible for a " rogue " computing department to start tweaking the cards to take money from innocent customers .
Confession : I ’m afraid to turn off my cell phone .
Not because I ’m afraid of being out of touch , mind you .
Heck , I could care less if people can reach me .
If you have something to tell me that ’s so important it would be worth interrupting Will and Grace , well , I think I ’d rather have another 45 minutes of ignorant bliss before I find out about it .
That ’s my motto : Will and Grace First , Earthquakes and Floods Later .
Here ’s why I ’m afraid to turn off my cell phone : because I ca n’t always seem to muster the brain cells necessary to turn it back on .
It has two buttons on it , a happy green button and a scary red button .
They have funny icons on them that do n’t mean very much to me .
You might think that the green button turns it on .
Green means go , right ?
Wrong .
I tried that .
Nothing doing .
I tried pressing and holding the green button , because sometimes these phones want you to press - and - hold so that you wo n’t accidentally take a picture of your ear , or disconnect the phone call in the middle of an important job interview , or whatnot .
It turns out it ’s the red button that turns it on .
When you press the red button , usually , nothing actually happens , so you suspect you might have done something wrong .
It turns out that you have , actually , turned on the phone , and if you ’re in a dark room , you would have noticed that the keyboard flashed when you turned it on .
In a bright room , nothing happens for six seconds .
That ’s usually long enough to think that you ’ve done something wrong .
So that ’s when I start trying the other buttons , like the happy green button .
In any case , I wind up feeling frustrated and not in control of my life .
Once you do learn that the red button turns the phone on , and you do n’t have to hold it , you start to get frustrated that the time it takes the phone to boot up and load the pretty background picture and get on the network is something like 30 seconds .
That ’s frustrating , too .
It seems like in the Olden Days you did n’t have to wait for half a minute to turn on an appliance .
There was a switch , up was on ( unless you lived in Europe , where they had a terrible war and could n’t afford appliances ) , you switched it , the thing went on and started spinning or shining or whatever it is that the thing was supposed to do .
Instantly .
End of story .
Indeed , it ’s surprising just how many of today ’s devices and gadgets and remote controls have actually made TVs , stoves , and telephones harder to use .
Suddenly , bad computer user interface design is seeping into the entire world .
Six years ago , with the total dominance of the consistent GUI interface of Mac and Windows , it seemed like the state of the art in software UI design was getting pretty good .
Nothing fabulous , mind you , but pretty good .
You could sit down with a new Windows app that you ’d never seen before and have a pretty good chance of being able to operate it correctly .
That ’s when I wrote a book called User Interface Design for Programmers , thinking , great !
It ’s time to get everybody on the same page here on how to design user interfaces , and then life will be wonderful .
Unfortunately , that was about the same time as there was a huge wave of new consumer gadgets , and , of course , that web thing hit us .
The web did n’t really have a standard UI .
You could make anything be a link .
We did n’t have dropdown menus , so we made do with all kinds of differently - behaved simulations of dropdown menus .
Gadgets ?
Gadgets were even worse .
They had tiny keyboards and tinier screens .
Combined with rampant featuritis , these damn devices did more and more things but just figuring out how to do them took a degree in engineering ( or a bright 12 year old , but slavery has been abolished , especially for 12 year olds . )
Maybe nobody told the people who design gadgets and gizmos and websites ( and even software ) that they need to work on their user interface skills .
So , this is their wake up call .
While most products were became increasingly incomprehensible , like the typical home entertainment remote control , with dozens of mushy little buttons marked “ MTS ” or “ SURR ” or “ PTY ” that nobody has any hope of understanding , something else was happening : a very few , very good designers were , somehow , coming up with truly great designs that were beautiful , easy to understand , fun , and which made people happy .
You know who they are because those products became bestsellers .
The Apple iPod. TiVo .
Google .
Even the Motorola RAZR , which is so hard to turn on , is , in most ways , a great design .
Over the next weeks and months , if all goes well , I ’m going to write a series of articles right here , on this website , on UI design for the modern age .
The whole series will be , tentatively , named Great Design .
If all goes well , we ’re going to look at some of the original principles of good UI design , much of which I covered in the first book , and revisit them and see how they apply to today ’s world of miniature gadgets , websites , and street - corner garbage cans .
Then , if we ’re really lucky , we ’re going even farther .
We ’re going to look at what it takes to make the leap from a servicable , decent product design to a Mindbogglingly Great , Earth - Shaking , History - Changing product design .
I have some theories about that , too .
Administatrivia
First , one change that you ’ll notice .
I ’m going to publish each article twice .
The first appearance will be a rough draft .
Later , I ’ll revise and edit the article , taking into account some of the feedback I received , and republish it as a second draft .
I ’m doing it this way because it lets me publish something almost as soon as I ’ve written it , without too much editing , secure in the knowledge that I can edit it to death later .
There are three ways to follow along :
Mr Fellows did not realise he had been struck until hours later
Alistair Fellows , 43 , from Stretton in Burton - on - Trent , had stepped out of his van during a storm in Tutbury when the bolt struck him .
Mr Fellows said he felt nothing at the time , his arm only beginning to swell five hours later .
He was also left with slightly impaired hearing and sight .
Colleagues at Burton Albion FC , where he works in maintenance , have nicknamed him " Flash " and " Lightning " .
Close calls
Mr Fellows said : " There was a flash , and the thunder and lightning came at the same time .
" I did n't realise anything had happened until a bit later on .
" My arm started to swell up , and my wife noticed that there was a mark on my arm . "
The experience has caused Mr Fellows to reflect on the close calls which have dogged him over the years .
People just can't believe how lucky / unlucky I am
Alistair Fellows
From the age of 12 until last Thursday , when the lightning struck , he has had four lucky escapes with electricity .
As a boy he suffered a shock as he pulled a plug from a socket , and twice in his 20s he narrowly escaped injury - once when he sliced through the live cable of his electric lawnmower , and again when he hacksawed through a shed cable he did not realise was live .
Toothbrush in ear
Mr Fellows also broke his skull twice in his teens .
He also told the BBC that , in 1990 , he had to go to hospital to have a toothbrush extracted from his ear after he fell in the shower .
" That was embarrassing , " he said .
No serious problems occurred from 1992 until 2004 , when Mr Fellows was seriously injured when his car was hit by a lorry .
" People just can't believe how lucky / unlucky I am , " he said .
" My wife is going to get me a crash helmet for my 50th birthday . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors is in talks to buy DaimlerChrysler AG 's struggling Chrysler Group in its entirety , according to several reports .
According to the reports , sources in Germany and the United States said high - level talks between GM ( down $ 0.14 to $ 36.30 , Charts ) and DaimlerChrysler ( up $ 2.83 to $ 73.08 , Charts ) executives are taking place .
Chrysler , which has already announced plans to close plants like this one in Newark , Del. , and cut 13,000 jobs , could be sold to rival General Motors , according to published reports .

Its German parent confirmed Wednesday it is looking at strategic options for the North American unit .
When asked if those options included a sale or spin -off of the unit , DaimlerChrysler Chairman Dieter Zetsche responded " this means all options are on the table . "
Chrysler Group announced Wednesday it would be cutting about 13,000 workers and closing plants over the next three years as a part of a restructuring plan aimed to restore profits by next year .
Talks of an alliance between GM and DaimlerChrysler was first reported recently in Germany 's Manager - Magazin .
Other unnamed sources said to be familiar with the discussions confirmed the reports Friday for Reuters and the industry newspaper Automotive News .
DaimlerChrysler employed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to consider options for the Chrysler Group , to help the automaker explore strategic options , according to trade newspaper .
But others are also skeptical on whether the discussions are real .
" This would be an at least $ 5 billion plus deal and GM is not that liquid right now , " John Casesa said , an automotive analyst with Casesa Strategic Advisors , told CNN .
" I 'm not convinced at all and I think it 's unlikely . "
Other experts contacted by CNNMoney.com said that while a GM purchase of Chrysler appeared unlikely , they could see other buyers emerging .
" The challenge is who would be a buyer , " David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research , said Wednesday of a possible sale of Chrysler .
" Maybe a Chinese company that really wants entrance into U.S. market or Renault - Nissan would see it fit with its strategy .
But it 's tough . "
Carlos Ghosen , the CEO of both French automaker Renault and Japanese automaker Nissan ( Charts ) , had expressed interest in finding a North American partner to join the alliance between his two companies .
Talks between GM and those two automakers last year were abandoned without any agreement .
Kevin Tynan , auto analyst at Argus Research , said Wednesday he believes Chrysler will end up being sold due to pressure from DaimlerChrysler 's shareholders to undo the 1998 merger , but he thinks a sale to a private equity group is more likely than a combination with another automaker .
" There 's value to those brands , " he said .
" I think relative to Ford Motor ( Charts ) , there 's less dead weight .
Nine years later , it 's probably the right thing to do .
I think there 's a feeling in Germany that it 's time to cut bait . "
Officials for DaimlerChrysler and GM issued no comments on the reports .
DaimlerChrysler has long tried to reverse the drop in sales with previous cost - cutting moves but slipped into the No. 4 spot last year behind Toyota ( up $ 0.21 to $ 136.98 , Charts ) in the United States .
Other reports have suggested that talks between Chrysler and GM were more limited in scope than a full merger .
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the two were in talks to jointly develop a large SUV that would be similar to the Chevrolet Suburban , a product that Chrysler Group does n't have in its lineup .
The New York Times had a similar report Friday .
Neither publication had their own reports on the potential merger talks as of mid-day Friday .

Lessons from Chrysler 's Valentine 's Day massacre
Earlier this year , the Bush administration started releasing untranslated documents captured from the Iraq regime online , on an internet site set up to , as the New York Times quoted , " leverage the Internet " to allow avid conservatives to pore through the documents looking for what U.N. inspectors , the C.I.A. , a massive U.S. government military hunt and a hundred forty thousand troops were not able to do -- find some evidence , somewhere , anywhere , that Hussein 's weapons programs were continuing forward after they were shut down in 1991 by the first Gulf War .
It was among the more moronic of efforts -- it made no sense from the beginning , except as desperate partisan hackery -- done after public pressure from the GOP in congress , which in turn was based on a groundswell of outrage from ( sigh ) conservative pundits , bloggers and other far - far - right Republican acolytes that these documents were not being translated speedily enough , and so they should be released to the public so that the public ( meaning desperate GOP supporters with time to kill ) could pore through them themselves , looking for any shreds of political advantage in the trove .
Now , nobody really expected that these documents contained anything terribly meaningful .
The evidence on the ground has demonstrated , through actual fact , that the weapons programs had indeed been shut down .
The whole point of the exercise was a political one .
But as it turns out , mixed in with those documents have been documentation of Iraq 's previous weapons programs , including instructions for how to make Sarin nerve gas and , now , detailed explorations of how to make a nuclear weapon .
Ask yourself this .
Would the administration have actually released these , had they known or even suspected that such information was in them ?
If the answer is no , that tends to demonstrate the salient point -- that the administration presumed there was nothing damning to find in these documents , but released them as political ploy to momentarily shut their critics up .
If the answer is yes -- that they thought there were important , sensitive documents buried here , documents that dealt with nerve gas and nuclear weapons -- then does n't that say something worse , that they were willing to release all those documents to the public ( and to other nations ) without even a cursory vetting , after pressure from GOP groups ?
Once again , we 're faced with only two possible choices .
Either the Bush administration sabotaged national security through incompetence -- or via partisan malice .

During the opening plenary , Tim O’Reilly suggested that the importance of software licensing is decreasing .
Software is increasingly a service , running on the Net , while licensing to date has focused on what ’s running on your computer .
He reported an astounding remark by Stallman , to the effect that his radical notions of freedom are not applicable to the services we all use every day .
Tim asks :
What standard of open - ness can we apply to Software - as - a - Service offerings , to the Googles , Yahoos , and Amazons of this world ?
It ’s a really important question .
I think I know the answer .
[ Update : Interesting follow - up from Tony Coates . ]
Set My Data Free ·
At the end of the day , information outlives software and transcends software and is more valuable than software .
I think any online service can call itself “ Open ” if it makes , and lives up to , this commitment :
Any data that you give us , we ’ll let you take away again , without withholding anything , or encoding it in a proprietary format , or claiming any intellectual - property rights whatsoever .
It seems to me that if you do n’t have that , you have nothing , and if you do have it , you have , if not everything , at least a solid foundation to build on .
That ’s basic , Level 0 , openness .
For extra credit , a service could also say :
We acknowledge your interest in any value - added information we distill from what you give us , and will share it back with you to the extent we can do so while preserving the privacy of others .
So , do we need some sort of Open Service analogue of the Open Source Definition ?
It could n’t hurt .
I suspect that if we can get the basic idea across , then we ’re in old - fashioned consumer - advocacy territory ; and I suspect that it will only take a small number of painful experiences for consumers to understand the issue at a pretty deep level .
Anyhow , good on Tim for turning the spotlight on this .
Environmentalists here say they are keeping an eye on Los Angeles for backsliding , but they acknowledge that the new efforts will make a significant difference .

As part of a project to restore water to the Owens Valley , a dam redirects water going to Los Angeles , causing it to flow into the Owens River .
Credit ... J. Emilio Flores for The New York Times
As winds whipped across Owens Lake on a recent afternoon , Mike Prather of the Owens Valley Committee , which along with the Sierra Club took Los Angeles to court over the environmental fallout of its water policies , marveled at sandpipers , American avocets and other birds frolicking in the shallow pools created by the irrigation .
“ This work will bring back more and more of them , ” Mr. Prather said , savoring the twist in the battle that means water once intended for Los Angeles will feed the lake .
“ It ’s Owens Valley ’s turn to stick its straw in L.A. ’s water , ” he said .
Court rulings and the threat of legal action have largely forced Los Angeles ’s hand in dealing with its past water moves , but city leaders say they are also intent on doing the right thing in keeping up a vital source of water while avoiding further damage to the Owens Valley .
H. David Nahai , president of the board that oversees the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , said Los Angeles was looking for less adversarial ways to resolve differences over the valley , which provides 40 percent to 60 percent of the city ’s water supply , depending on the snowfall in the mountains .
“ We ca n’t change the past , but we can shape the future , ” said Mr. Nahai , one of five board members appointed by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa , who promised a friendlier approach to the valley when he took office in July 2005 .
Susan Cash , the chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors of Inyo County , where the Owens Valley is located , said animosity toward Los Angeles had lessened since the early 20th century , when the water diversion was made possible by the purchase of much of the valley by less - than - forthcoming city operatives .

Lunchtime on Thursday and in a farmhouse kitchen in the heart of Wiltshire , a white dinner plate is reverentially placed on the table .
On it are four slices of meat , carved from a saddle of lamb that has been roasted with garlic and rosemary in the Aga for 40 minutes .
It 's been beautifully cooked , seared burnt - brown around the edges , while at its centre there 's a touch of vivid pink that bleeds a watery red jus on to the ceramic surface .
Just the job normally , a real favourite , but today I can't stomach it .
I try , cutting off a sliver and putting it in my mouth , but have to force myself to swallow , and it's all I can do to hold that morsel down , to stop myself throwing up there and then .
The trouble is the lunch and I are somewhat over - acquainted .
We first met on a hillside on Dartmoor on Tuesday afternoon .
Together with farmer Brian Lavis , I picked out the nine - month - old lamb from a skittering flock , and on Wednesday followed behind as it was transported to an abattoir in Dorset , where we met , briefly , again that night .
The following morning I returned at daybreak , to watch as Faw - Faw , my fluffy friend , was turned from mammal to meat - electrocuted , throat - slit , beheaded and skinned .
An abattoir worker then carved a slice from the carcass 's steaming hindquarters and handed the still - twitching flesh to me in a plastic bag .
I took it away and an hour later cooked it , and now it 's on my fork , in my mouth , then sliding haltingly down my throat .
It 's been quite a journey for both of us - from pasture to plate - and it's one the rest of Britain can experience for themselves next week , in all the Technicolor gory of television .
Broadcast on BBC
Three , the emotively named Kill It , Cook It , Eat It , will show lambs , pigs and cattle being slaughtered in an abattoir .
For an added twist , the spectacle will be witnessed by a group of specially invited guests , who will be served the meat to eat .
Heavily plugged and promoted , the programme makers insist this is n't just a ratings - grabbing bloodfest , but an attempt to question modern Britain 's relationship with the food we eat - to reconnect people with the animals that fill the shrink - wrapped packets of meat they buy in the supermarket .
Planning on sticking a leg of roast lamb in front of the family this Easter ?
Then is n't it your responsibility to know where the animal came from , how it was reared and how it was killed ?
Or is that just a load of middle - class , sentimentalist angst ?
They are only animals after all and if you 're really that worried about it , then is n't the simple answer not to do it , to go vegetarian ?
After all , saying sorry to your sausages , crying over your casseroles , is all a bit After The Lord Mayor 's Show .
The truth is , of course , that like most people , I try not to think about it too deeply .
I eat meat because I like the taste of it , and do n't want thoughts of butchery and brutality to spoil that pleasure .
But turn the clock back to Tuesday afternoon and I 've nowhere to hide .
I 'm in the middle of a five - acre field near Launceston , Cornwall , wondering how one goes about choosing one 's lunch when the menu's got four legs and a fleece .
I 'm with Farmer Brian , 62 , whose family has been working these pastures for more than a century , and who keeps 1,200 ewes and 150 cattle .
He gathers the sheep into a pen and points at a black - faced lamb .
" Good eating , that one , " he says in an accent as thick as the mist shrouding the granite - topped hills behind .
How do you know ?
" He 's from a crossbred ewe and a Suffolk tup , nice size too , big fat back end on him . "
So much for the parentage of the animal ( he / it is a castrated male ) , does he have a name ?
" Tom , " he says with a laugh " I 've probably called him many names , but none you 'd repeat in polite company . "
A blue plastic tag in the animal 's right ear bears an identification number - 4454 - and so it is that Faw - Faw and I are introduced .
He 's a decent - sized chap , full of life , and he bucks and kicks as I sink a hand into his fleece to steady him , so I can spray a blue streak of marker - paint down his back to aid identification .
Released , he runs off to join his chums and enjoy his last few hours of freedom .
Until he had the misfortune of meeting me , there 's no doubt Faw - Faw had a good life .
Born last April , he has been running free outdoors ever since , and has eaten nothing more than his mother 's milk , grass and a handful of winter feed made from wheat and barley .
I can be sure of this because Farmer Brian 's animals supply The Real Meat Company , a business that has spent the past two decades sourcing meat bred to the highest welfare standards .
The result is meat that is of a high quality and great taste , if more expensive than the standard fare .
It was set up in 1986 by Richard Guy and his wife , Gill , a couple so dedicated to the good food cause that they eat only their own meat , preferring to go vegetarian when away from home .
Richard was among those invited to take part in the forthcoming BBC series , and says he is intrigued to see what impact it will have on the viewing public .
While he acknowledges there is a sensationalist aspect to the pre-filmed show ( the guests , one of whom was a vegetarian presenter from the BBC Asian Network , were n't told they were going to an abattoir until the very last minute , in order , no doubt , to maximise their shocked reactions ) , he believes the questions it is asking are valid .
" I believe that if you eat meat then you have asked someone by proxy to kill something , and you personally carry a responsibility for how that animal has lived and died , " he says .
" It 's important that people confront what other people are doing on their behalf , and make their own decision .
The problems come if people cease to be aware of how well or how badly it can go for the animal , if they say " I do n't want to know the detail , count me out " . "
But surely if you 're really worried about animals ' welfare , is n't the best way to prevent their suffering to stop slaughtering them altogether ?
To let them live .
" No , I think that not eating meat is cruel , " Richard argues .
" We have eaten meat for a very long time and I would venture that if an animal has lived a good life , it is better than not having lived at all , and that is what would happen if people stopped eating meat altogether .
" The fields would be empty of sheep and cattle , they would not exist .
The lambs have had a good life .
It is going to end for some of them but that is OK . "
Many will disagree with that position , while more will wonder what the fuss is about .
Should n't we be thankful there 's enough food for everyone to eat , rather than going around conferring rights on animals that many of the world 's human inhabitants do n't have ?
Is n't it soft , squeamish , overly sentimental ?
As I head east from Devon towards Dorset , I start to worry about how squeamish I may be when confronted with the realities of the slaughterhouse .
I stop for food - a meat pasty , provenance unknown - and get chatting to one of the customers about what I 'm up to .
The woman , in her 60s , tells me how as a child , her father , a farmer , used to bring home the baby piglets that were squashed to death at birth - the runts of the litter , rolled on and crushed by their mother .
" Bit of butter , then pop them into the frying - pan whole .
Lovely job , " she says .
" Nothing to it . "
While my childhood was n't quite that raw , I was brought up in Somerset with various animals around .
I shot and still shoot the odd pigeon and rabbit , and have been to an abattoir once before .
I was ten , and it was a school trip to a chicken paste factory .
Whether the outing was intended to be educational , or was in fact some sort of punishment , I am unsure ( the presence of " Killer " Carnegie , the school 's PE teacher , on the trip may well have been significant ) but it has remained with me ever since .
In stunned silence we watched chicken after chicken being hung by their feet from a conveyor belt before being electrocuted , having their throats slit and then immersed in boiling water to remove their feathers .
The finale was watching a hangar - full of hair - netted women pick the flesh from the carcasses as they passed by on a conveyor belt .
I have never eaten chicken paste since .
I was put off by the smell and the sights and , anyway , it 's not that much of a sacrifice .
But I 'm far more worried about the lamb .
It 's a big mammal , with lots of blood , and I 'm concerned that I might be put off all meat for life .
I do n't want to be .
I like it too much .
And I do n't really like vegetarians .
They make life complicated when they come round for dinner .
The trouble is I 'm also starting to form some sort of bond with Faw - Faw .
On Wednesday night I visit him at the abattoir in Sturminster Newton , where his life is going to end .
He 's in a barn divided into stalls that are filled with 20 - odd cattle and the same number of sheep .
There 's straw on the floor , hay to eat and water to drink .
The idea is to keep the animals as calm as possible .
Not only is this good welfare but it ensures the meat is good .
Stress and panic cause lactic acid to build up in the beasts ' muscles , which can spoil the taste .
All the sheep turn their backs to me but Faw - Faw keeps craning his head around .
Could he have guessed what 's going to happen , who 's to blame ?
Ridiculous .
The following morning at 7.30 am he 's herded the 50 yards from death row to the abattoir .
It is a clinical place , where the animals are hooked up and slaughtered efficiently .
The slaughterman places a giant pair of tongs about his head , and a massive jolt of electricity renders him instantly unconscious .
He 's then hooked onto an overhead conveyor belt by his rear legs , and a single sweep of a knife severs the carotid artery in the throat .
This process takes about ten seconds .
Suspended upside down , the lamb 's still - beating heart pumps a flood of blood on to the floor for about one minute .
Faw - Faw is no more .
I 'm doing fine so far but it 's the transition from sheep to meat that gets me .
As he passes down the line his feet and head are cut off , the pelt peeled back and the guts tumbled out .
The carcass is steaming and I feel nauseous , a feeling that reaches cheek - bulging proportions when I place a hand on the pink , slightly sticky , ribcage .
It 's hot and the flesh is soft , gelatinous .
And yet no longer alive .
A few yards on and the bureaucracy kicks on .
The carcass is weighed , visually checked for signs of disease , stamped by the inspectors and then a joint of meat cut out and handed to me .
I hold it in my bare hands and feel that heat again , the muscles ticking , the flesh twitching , and enough 's enough .
I 'm out of there .
An hour later , I 'm back at Richard 's farmhouse near Warminster , and have pulled myself together enough to place that same piece of meat in the oven , a sprinkling of dried rosemary and a bit of garlic on top .
Some 40 minutes on and out it comes .
It looks and smells delicious .
I try to eat a piece but twice have to spit it out .
Something about it , its animal smell I think , reminds me too much of that slaughterhouse .
The third mouthful I manage to swallow - I persevere , because in a way I feel I owe it to Faw - Faw .
What a waste otherwise .
It 's a good bit of eating , as Brian promised , and doubtless would have been better still had it been hung for a week or so , as is normal practice .
But I can't eat any more now anyway .
Richard says he 'll send me some other cuts , and I thank him , fairly confident that by then the memories , my senses , will have dulled enough for me to really enjoy it .
In the meantime , I reflect on the experience and am surprised how much it has affected me .
I 'm very aware that what I 've seen is top practice - a good farmer producing a welllooked after animal that is killed as humanely as possible in a well - run abattoir .
This is not how the majority of meat we eat is produced , and that should be real cause for concern .
In Britain , eating meat is seen as a right , rather than a privilege .
Mass production has depressed prices to such an extent that there 's no longer anything " special " about eating a leg of lamb , a chicken or a joint of beef .
Instead , we plough through it three meals a day , oblivious to the fact that it is different from a loaf of bread or a bag of spuds , and that it is only cheap because corners are cut that are damaging to the welfare of the animal and the quality of the end product .
There should be an element of respec - acknowledgement at least - between eater and eaten , and there rarely is .
Keep the nut cutlets on hold for the moment , but kick out the chilli sauce .
No more donner kebabs for me .

In the last 10 years the Internet grew very , very fast .
It is a bunch of thousands of little networks put together .
Billion computers are connected and it is basically not controlled or even owned by a government or company .
There are no laws , everybody can put his webpages online which can be accessed by everybody on the world who is sitting in front of a computer with Internet access .
I believe that this can and will change the world as we know it today .
But there are several governments who think that this unlimited access to information is dangerous for their citizens .
These are for example Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Cuba , Jordan , Tunisia , Burma , Singapore , Uzbekistan , Yemen , Kuwait , Vietnam , Syria , Iran , United Arab Emirates and parts of Africa .
And even in countries like Australia , Switzerland and in some parts of Germany they censor websites .
This ranks from a very easy to circumvent DNS blocking of only 2 Nazi sites in parts of Germany to a government office with 30.000 employees only working in blocking thousands of websites , services and ports in China .
Though the blocking methods are different there are also different ways to bypass them .
I will try to show you how to access the website of Amnesty International , BBC , Google and other blocked sites in your country .
I made this website in very basic HTML , so that you can even view it with a very old computer .
Please share this information , link the site , copy it , mirror it , print it ( I did n't " hide " any links , so that no link is lost when you print it ) and teach your friends and relatives !

Well , I 'm living in Germany , which is not very famous for it 's censoring .
But the local government from one of the 16 German states ( NRW ) tries to introduce censorship by blocking 2 US Nazi sites .
Sure , I really do n't like those guys but in my opinion no government or even a system administrator has the right to choose which information a individual have access to .
What websites are next ?
Who chooses which websites will be blocked ?
Additionally , my school blocks some websites and so I became interesting in this topic .

First I wanted to publish this paper under the GNU Free Documentation License ( http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html) but I think the licence is to restrictive and complicated ( see also : Why You Should n't Use the GNU FDL - http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html).
So I made up my own one based on the X11 licence ( http://www.x.org/Downloads_terms.html).
You have to choose to bypass the Internet censorship or not .
I only show you how to do it , I can't take any responsibility .
In several censor countries you will go to jail if they catch you , in a lot of companies you will get fired and some schools will ban you .
Of course the censors not only block Internet traffic , they are also looking at it ( in countries / companies with a little Internet population ) and try to find out who is bypassing their firewall how .
An easy way to find out who ( and how ) is bypassing the firewall is by just looking for some identicators in the logfiles :
Right after the Internet connection is established the user is connecting to only one server and remains connected to it all the time he 's online .
What a user should do right after he gets an " access denied " message from his censor .
( open a special website , go to a chatroom , connect to a special server ... )
Try to avoid getting caught this way !
Please note that the proxies on my website are not checked / verified .
It could be that a censoring government run those proxies just to check who is accessing which blocked information .
Maybe some of them are also maintained by hackers that can examine every piece of information that passes their servers ( your credit card information , for example ) .
So carefuly choose the server you connect to and even think twice if you use them to transfer private data .

There are many different ways to censor Internet traffic .
Sometimes there are 2 or more combined .
Please write me at freerk@gmx.net and let me know which blocking methods are used in your country , which ISP you are you using , and the bypass method you used to bypass it :
It would be very useful for other users !
More info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_cyberspace
This example is used by some German providers .
It is a very cheap and easy censoring method and the same is true for bypassing it .
First , I will explain what the Domain Name System is : Every computer on the Internet has an unique address , a little bit like a telephone number .
These are 4 numbers from 0 to 255 separated with a dot .
For example : 62.141.48.209 is the IP address for www.freerk.com.
Because remembering such a number is very difficult , the DNS was invented .
This service maps a URL to its IP address .
If you type www.freerk.com into your browser , the request is sent to the DNS - server that was automatically given to you by your ISP on dialing into the Internet .
A lot of addresses are already cached , so the DNS - server sends the IP address for the URL back to you .
If the DNS - server has no cached information on the site requested by you , he asks one of the 13 root servers , which know all addresses .
If the DNS - server from your provider is censoring , he just refuse to send you the real IP - address .
He sends you nothing or a page from a " sorry " website .
More info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS
3.2 Forced proxy server / transparent proxy
You have to specify a proxy server in your ' Internet Explorer ' settings in order to get a connection to the Internet .
Sometimes , the ISP is using a transparent proxy .
With these you can't see easily if there is a proxy or not .
Every request you send to or receive from the Internet is checked at this server and redirected to you ( well , or not ... ) .
This means that all Internet traffic goes through the servers of the censor , who is scanning the content for ' bad words ' .
This dynamic filtering is true for most filters in schools , libraries and companies .
If the site contains bad words it is blocked .
The person who is offering the blocked information could prevent the censoring by " hide " the content inside of images .
For the user there is almost no difference , but it is difficult for a computer program to " read " the text inside an image .
Also SSL encrypted traffic ( a URL starting with https ://...) can't be scanned easily .
You can test which keywords are blocked on your connection on http://www.zensur.freerk.com/kword/ there you can enter the keyword (s ) you want to test an click on " send " when you get the message " You entered [ your word here ] " in return everything is fine , but if you get an error message you know which words are blocked .
Ports are like doors for a special service to a server or PC .
They rank from 0 to 65535 .
The standard ports are from 0 to 1024 , these are the well known ports .
The official list you can get under http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers and a description on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computing).
If a censor blocks a port , every traffic on this port is dropped , so its useless for you .
Most censors blocks the ports 80 , 1080 , 3128 and 8080 , because these are the common proxy ports .
Because all of the proxies on common ports are useless for you , you have to find proxies that are listening on an uncommon port .
These are very difficult to find .
You can easily test which ports are blocked on your connection .
Just open the DOS - prompt , type telnet login.icq.com 80 and hit enter .
The number is the port you want to test .
If you get some weird symbols in return everything is ok , if it says " timeout " or something similar , that port is blocked by your ISP .
Here are the most important ports for us :
20+21 - FTP ( file transfer )
22 - SSH ( secure remote access )
23 - telnet ( remote access ) and also Wingates ( special kind of proxies )
25 - SMTP ( send email )
53 - DNS ( resolves an URL to an IP )
80 - HTTP ( normal web browsing ) and also a proxy
110 - POP3 ( receive email )
443 - SSL ( secure HTTPS connections )
1080 - Socks proxy
3128 - Squid proxy
8000 - Junkbuster proxy
8080 - a proxy
Normally the censorship is implemented on servers from the ISP or government , but in some schools , private homes and some companies the blocking software is installed on every PC .

3.6 Censorware on the server ( inside of networks )
These are programs that are mostly installed on servers in schools , libraries , companies or countries with a little Internet population .
3.6.1 Bess / N2H2
Bess is a proxy filter that is often used in schools / universities and companies .
It can easily bypassed with Webproxies .
More info : http://www.n2h2.com/products/bess_home.php
http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/BESS/
3.6.2 DansGuardian
It 's an Open Source Webfilter .
Free for non-commercial use and thus it is widely used in universities , schools and libraries .
It works as a Proxy with URL and keyword filtering ( and also with the PICS - Standard ) .
It 's often used on an IPCop machine , however , the author at DansGuardian does n't like it .

http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/SmartFilter/
Most Internet filters works with a blacklist , which means that access to all sites is allowed , except some special sites ( well , sometimes there are a lot of exceptions ... ) .
A whitelist works the other way around : Access to all sites is blocked , except some special ones .
For a normal ISP it is almost impossible to offer - because the Internet is nearly worthless .
The whitelist scheme is used by free Internet terminals that are sponsored by a company which allows users the free access to their e-commerce site .
This filter scheme is the most difficult to circumvent .
Some time ago , there was a German ISP who had a completely free 0800 - dial in number .
Once you dialed in , you only could surf to amazon.de and about 10 more e-commerce sites .
But you could also connect to the other customers of the ISP .
So somebody with a flatrate connected to both his normal ISP and the 0800 - free ISP and set up a proxy .
So all the users of the free ISP could use that proxy to connect to other sites .
More info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_list
Since you can't directly access a server that is blocked you have to send the request to a non blocked server which redirects the traffic to the real site you want to visit .
There are different types of these " gatekeepers " .
Well , it 's as easy as it sounds : Just change your Internet Service Provider !
For example , only in ' Nordrhein - Westfalen ' ( a state of Germany ) is there a censoring firewall , so you can just subscribe to an ISP outside that state .
But normally the censorship counts for all the country .
One possibility is to try out an ISP outside the country .
That costs a lot , but that way you will have a normal Internet access and wo n't have to worry about getting around filters .
This could be a normal dialup provider in an neighbor country or even better , a 2 - way Internet access via satellite like http://www.europeonline.com/, http://www.remoteworkcentral.com/, http://registrierung.tiscali.de/produkte/1400_satellit.php, http://www.gilat.de/,
http://www.hns.com/, http://www.vsatnet.com/, http://www.starband.com/, http://www.wildblue.com/, http://www.skycasters.com/, http://www.directduo.com/, http://www.orbitsat.com/, http://www.ottawaonline.com/ and so on , just search with a search engine for ' 2 - way Internet via satellite [ your country or neighbor country ] ' or something like that .
Normally , you would automatically would use the DNS - server of your ISP to resolve domain names like www.freerk.com to 62.141.48.209 .
Internally , only these IP - addresses are used to send / receive data on the Internet .
If your DNS - server is censoring , you simply can use another DNS - server .
Under Windows , just right - click in your system panel on the ' network ' icon and select properties of the TCP / IP - protocol .
In Linux you have to edit the ' /etc/resolv.conf ' file .
Use the server that is ( virtual ) your nearest .
If you want to setup your own DNS - server use Bind ( http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/).
The list of the 13 official root servers is located here : ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/domain/named.root
For redundancy , it would be good to ad the alternative root servers located in Europe from ORSN : ftp://ftp.orsn.org/orsn/orsn.hint .

It 's also possible to act as a manual DNS server by yourself .
Just use the ping or traceroute service on a non censoring machine to get the IP of your desired server .
Then use the IP instead of the URL in your browser .
You will always get an IP , but it wo n't work every time to access the website via the IP , because a lot of webhosters host up to 500 or more websites on one server with one IP .
But it will work fine with bigger websites .

You can put a proxy server between your Internet connection and the site you want to visit .
You send your request for a special website to that proxy server , which request the page from the Internet and deliver it to you .
Normally , those servers cache the requested pages , so that on the next request he can deliver the page directly from the cache .
That would be faster and cheaper .
We use those servers to bypass censorship .
For the eyes / computers of our ISP / Government we are only connecting to the proxy , they can't easily see , that we are connecting to a " bad site " .
But sometimes the standard proxy ports ( 80 , 1080 , 3128 and 8080 ) are blocked .
In that case you have to use the proxies that are listening on an uncommon port .
More info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server
Standard Proxies can be found everywhere on the net .
Almost every provider offer a proxy for their customers .
Here are a few , it's in the widely spread " hostname : port " format .

Due to the fact that several censors block the common proxy ports ( 80 , 1080 , 3128 and 8080 ) to prevent circumvention you have to use proxies that are listening on a uncommon port .
For example 8000 for the Junkbuster proxy or 6588 for the AnalogX proxy .
You get a weekly updated list of Proxies that are listening on a non standard port here :

Webproxies are CGI - scripts that you access with your browser .
The CGI script then opens a different URL ( Internetaddress ) .
So your firewall thinks you are only connecting to the server with the CGI - script .
The addresses under 4.5.4 are not really meant as proxies .
They act as translators , html - checkers or as a web archive .
You can use them as a kind of proxy anyway .
These webproxies are good instruments for " quick 'n dirty " bypassing .
You do n't have to configure your browser or anything , but it 's kind of slow and wo n't work with all webpages .
Only the proxies that are going over a secure connection can be used for phrase filtering , but the others are perfect for URL / IP filtering .
Use them in your school , company or library when you have no privileges to install / change something on the machine .
These links points to google .
de because the site is very small , useful , always on , and does not contain the " .com " extension of DOS - Files that are filtered by some proxies .
If you do have webspace with cgi ability you can download the CGIProxy from James Marshall and install it on that webspace ( there is a easy installer which does everything for you : http://install.xav.com/?p=cgiproxy).
Or you can install it on your PC at home and access it at work .
How to do so you can read here : http://www.peacefire.org/circumventor/simple-circumventor-instructions.html.
To find new working proxies search for " nph-proxy.cgi " , " nph-proxy.pl " , " Start Using CGIProxy " , " Start browsing through this CGI - based proxy " , " WARNING : Entering non-anonymous area " or something like that with Google , Alltheweb , Wisenut or another search engine .

Several years ago when the Internet connections where slow and the " www " was just invented , many people just got a to email restricted access to the Internet .
That 's the origin of the " Agora " and " www4email " software .
Some of these email robots are still available and we can use them to bypass Internet censorship .
The best thing would be to subscribe to a free email provider which allows SSL - connections ( like https://www.fastmail.fm/, https://www.ziplip.com/, https://www.hushmail.com/, https://www.safe-mail.net/, https://www.mail2world.com/, https://www.webmails.com/ e.t.c ) and use that account with the email addresses below .
I put the field where you have to input the URL in brackets .
It still works great for text .
But will be some big problems with images or even DHTML , JavaScript , Java , Flash e.t.c .
Also other services besides www are possible , for a very good tutorial on this see ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email .
There is also a web based service under http://www.web2mail.com/. I again used www.web.freerk.com/c/ as an example because the URL is allways accessible and the '.com ' in the original Google address is often considered as a .com DOS - file by some computers and censorship systems .
The www4mail software ( http://www.www4mail.org/) is newer than the Agora software .
A eMail with just " help " in the subject line will get you a tutorial on how to use the service properly .

Hide content inside of images .
More Info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography
4.7.1 Camera / Shy Camera / Shy is the only steganographic tool that automatically scans for and delivers decrypted content straight from the Web .
It is a stand - alone , Internet Explorer - based browser that leaves no trace on the user 's system and has enhanced security .
Camera / Shy is an application that enables stealth communications , such software can be useful in countries where Email communications are regularly monitored and censored , such as happens in China .

There are different projects of peer - 2 - peer programs to bypass censorship .
They work like Napster , Kazaa and eDonkey , which means that you have to download a little tool that contains a server and a client part .
4.8.1 Peek a Booty
The goal of the Peekabooty Project is to create a product that can bypass the nationwide censorship of the World Wide Web practiced by many countries .
Peekabooty uses a complicated communications system to allow users to share information while revealing little about their identity .
When a node receives a request for a web page it randomly decides whether to pass this on or access the page itself .
It also only knows the address of its nearest partner .
This makes it difficult to determine who requested what information and is designed to protect users from anyone trying to infiltrate the system from inside .
More info : http://www.peek-a-booty.org/
Freenet is the oldest and most widely spread P2P - program to beat censorship , so a lot of people use it and it has actually worked well for several years .
There is no access to the Internet possible through the Freenet client .
You can only view / download stuff from the ' free net ' .
You install the client as a local proxy which is listening on port 8888 and can access links like ' http://localhost:8888/SSK@fjfkHAbxdwMyTMFgtZjcP2ge-AYPAgM/sites/fwhh/index.html'
It looks like a kind of normal URL .
The ' localhost : 8888 ' addresses the proxy server on port 8888 that is running on your local machine .
The rest of the URL is something like an encrypted file name .
It is not possible to determine who put some information into the network or who is downloading it .

4.8.4 TriangleBoy Safeweb , a company that received funding from In - Q - Tel , the CIS 's centure fund , released software called " Triangle Boy " .
The software is a peer - to - peer application that volunteers download onto their PC's .
A User that has been denied access to any website by a censor can use the Triangle Boy software to circumvent the censorship .
Currently the Triangle Boy software only provides access to the Voice of America , because this service is blocked by the Chinese government .

Other services than the www .
The normal port for newsservers 119 is usually blocked , so you have to access the Usenet via a different port .
If you sometimes only want to read some very common newsgroups you can easily visit them via free web - based newsservers like http://groups.google.com/, http://news.spaceports.com/, http://wnews.easyusenet.com/wnews-free.cgi and http://www.news2web.com/.
A lot of newsserver companies offer their services on a non standard port .
Just ask them before signup .
If you need access to a newsserver with your newsclient you have to subscribe to one of these newsserver - companies which allow access to their newsservers on an uncommon port :
http://www.giganews.com/
( news.giganews.com on ports 23 and 80 )
http://www.teranews.com/
- ( news.teranews.com on ports 23 , 25 and 7501 )
http://www.easynews.com/
- ( proxy.news.easynews.com on 22 , 23 , 53 , 80 , 110 and 443 , or try their web - based service at members.easynews.com port 81 )
http://www.newscene.com/

- ( news.newsdemon.com on ports 23 , 25 , 80 , 7000 , 8000 and 9000 .
europe.newsdemon.com and useast.newsdemon.com on ports 443 and 8080 .
SSL connections at us-secure.newsdemon.com and europe-ssl.newsdemon.com on ports 563 , 80 and 81 )
http://www.supernews.com/ - ( news.supernews.com on any port you like )
http://www.octanews.com/ - ( news.octanews.com on any port you like )
http://www.readfreenews.com/
- ( news.readfreenews.net and allnews.readfreenews.net at port 80 and 120
Note : Unless SSL is used , all traffic is unencrypted , so you can access these newsservers , but the censors can easily monitor all your traffic !
It would be more secure to use a SSH port forwarding .

4.9.4 Instant Messenger Instant Messengers are very popular .
You have to register your nickname at one of the companies and download their software .
Then when you are on the Internet you can start the software and log onto their servers .
You are then marked as " online " and all your friends who know your nickname and have the same Instant Messenger client can see that you are online and easily chat with you .
Everyone of the 4 big IM players has its own software client which contain advertisement , spyware and none is compatible with the other IM protocols .
I recommend you to download Miranda , which is a open source Instant Messenger which is very small , without ads or spyware and working without installation .
It works great with every IM protocol , even at the same time .

It is one think is to access information that is already censored , but another challenge is to publish one 's own information that can't easily be censored .
Here you can see my ideas on how to avoid censorship :
Publish with a lot of mirrors .
Especially dynamic IP 's with a dyndns.org redirector are useful .
Put your pages on so many different servers that the censor 's can't successfully block all servers .

According to the buzz on this forum thread , Java 5.0 ( nee 1.5.0 ) ships with a tool called " apt " ( Annotation Processing Tool ) that enhances the traditional javac compiler with the ability to let the user write code that examines and transforms the AST .
I assume this tool will not let you extend the Java language in arbitrary ways : it seems like apt can only parse source code that is legal Java .
However , it will let you create compile - time checks for some rules that previously could only be checked at runtime .
It will also likely be useful for code generation ; some heavily used Java projects rely on bytecode manipulation ( JDO , JBoss , Tapestry ) and I suspect they could simplify their lives a lot with this .

Shawn Hogan has received plenty of attention in the last year for his decision to fight the MPAA over the lawsuit they filed against him , claiming he had shared the movievia a file sharing program .
The problem ?
Hogan did n't actually share the movie , has never downloaded it , and actually owns the DVD of the movie in question .
The MPAA made it clear that if he just paid them $ 2,500 , they would forget the whole thing -- which certainly has the feel of extortion .
So , Hogan decided to fight the case in court to prove they were wrong , and said he would n't let them back out and run like they 've done in other cases .
All this , despite the fact that it would probably cost him over $ 100,000 in legal fees .
Hogan decided it was worth it on principle .
However , in preparing for the case , it looks like Hogan and his lawyer discovered that the studio might not actually have the rights to the movie .
The explanation is a little confusing , but it appears that there are two separate organizations involved : Universal City Studios Productions LLLP and Universal City Studios LLLP ( you can see why this gets confusing ) .
The first ( we 'll call them " Productions " ) is the one who sued Hogan .
However , it was the other ( " plain old Studios " ) who filed the copyright registration .
So , in preparing for the case , Hogan and his lawyers went looking for proof that plain old Studios had transferred the copyright to Productions -- which they got .
The problem , however , is that the notice transferring the rights happens to occur two months before plain old Studios actually registered the copyright .
In other words , they handed over the rights before they even got them -- making the whole thing a bit of a mess .
Apparently , it 's messy enough that Hogan and his lawyer hope to have the whole case dismissed .
Unfortunately , having such a case dismissed on what appears to be a ( stupid and careless ) technicality wo n't help much in dealing with other cases where people are falsely accused ( assuming this thing is n't that common ) -- but it should save Hogan a lot in legal fees .
Either way , it 's yet another example of the somewhat reckless abandon with which the industry seems to file these lawsuits .
Why bother making sure ( a ) the person did it or ( b ) you own the copyright before suing ?
That takes all the challenge out of suing your customers .
To begin , we need to go back to the 1930s .
It was in this era that the discoveries of the major oil fields in the Gulf region were made .
Of course , people had been pumping oil in the area since at least several decades prior .
However , it was at this later date ( 1938 to be exact ) that the full extent of the size of the fields came to be known , particularly with regards to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , then only 6 years old ( at least in its modern form ) .
During the backroom political wrangling constant throughout WWII , the United States essentially sealed an alliance that remains with us today , when FDR signed an agreement with then - king Abdul Aziz on February 14 , 1945 when the US essentially guaranteed a healthy flow of military supplies and maintanance of the Saudia royal family 's time in power in exchange for priveleged US and US company access to the bountiful Saudi oil fields .
Of course , FDR and US policy makers new very well that the Saudi kingdom was an autocratic monarchy .
But , as was so often said in what would become known as the Cold War , " better they 're our bastards than their ( ie the USSR's ) bastards . "
Because , as many of you perhaps know , it was clear to US policy makers and strategic thinkers by 1945 that the Soviet Union would be the US 's main strategic global competitor after WWII , with Japan and Germany defeated and destroyed , the UK and France weakened , their empires in retreat .
So , maintaining a vital lifeline to a major source of power ( if not the major source of power ) in the modern industrial world was deemed vital , in recognition of the strategic threat the Soviets posed .
This alliance was futher cemented in that the Saudis were conservatively disposed and pious , while , of course , communism was a militantly atheistic philolosphy .
Also , it should be noted that this piety was seen as a great asset ( logically so ) in the minds of US policy makers at the time .
Indeed , such a strategic decision , which was eminently sensible in the context of the Cold War , demonstrates the degree to which individuals are products of their own time and circumstances and cannot foresee " the trajectory of history . "
Israel , the Second Pillar
Of course , simultaneous to what is still a largely unknown series of events ( the creation of US - Saudi relations ) World War II was raging , and with it , tragically , the Holocaust .
In many ways a result of this perhaps - unprecedented crime against humanity , the world community moved to create a new state for world Jewry , of course , Israel .
It should be noted - as many of you perhaps know - that the modern Zionist movement had already been underway for over half of century , instigated by Theodor Hetzl in the late 19th century as a response to continued and seemingly unending persecution of Jews in the context of European societies .
In the meantime , in what is known as the " aaliyah , " many Jews did in fact journey to Palestine .
However , until the immediate aftermath of WWII , Jews - who had been , albeit in small numbers , a presence in Palestine for centuries - formed something approaching a majority in the area .
However , my goal here is not to go into the history of Israel .
That has been done enough elsewhere .
Rather , it is to provide a bit of background to what would become the second major pillar of the United States 's post - World War II policy , which was support for Israel .
Indeed , the US was one of the first nations to recognize the new state in 1948 .
Unlike the US 's support for Saudi Arabia , however , which was fundamentally a relationship premised on REAL POLITIK , the US 's support for Israel was primarily MORAL .
Right here , perhaps , we begin to see some of the inherent contradicitons of US policy in the region as they would develop over time .
Although some contend that US support for Israel is also a primarily REALPOLITIK relationship , I disagree .
Although Israel 's use as a sort of regional policeman would increase after the 1967 war , I fundamentally disagree with folks who proffer such an interpretation .
I see US support for Israel as primarily motivated by moral considerations , although more recently ( and more disturbingly ) by ideological considerations ( which I will discuss below ) .
The world changes , the paradigm hardens
The period from about 1968 to 1979 offer the last major paradigm shift in world history , albeit not on a scale similar to the paradigm shift of the 1939 to 1948 period ( one can argue that we are currently going through a similar shift , which makes sense given that such shifts tend to happen every 30 or 40 years .
Of course , we wo n't know until more time has passed ) .
Basically , the world underwent a shift away from Keynesian capitalism and towards neoliberlism , and towards a more free - wheeling , expressive culture less shackled to traditional cutlural mores .
Both of these processes have greatly undermined traditional social relations in both the developed and developing worlds and have led also to a fundamentalist backlash that has taken many forms , really in most of the world .
Also , the early 1970s saw the Bretton Woods agreement breakdown with the end of the gold standard and its tie to the dollar as the the fundamental means of regulating global capital flows .
This agreement , set up at a conference in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire in 1944 established the dollar as the currency of ' last resort , ' but with the dollar also tied - and thus always exchangeable - for gold .
In 1971 , Richard Nixon decided to take the United States dollar away from its gold peg , thus effectively ending the Bretton Woods framework .
Without getting much into the economics of this , this decision was largely spurred by increased US inflation ( primarily a product of Vietnam War spending , coupled with new Great Society programs and tax cuts as well as increased global competition , especially from the likes of Japan and West Germany , getting back on line after their midcentury disasters ) .
It was also at this time that the US began to run trade deficits - keep in mind that the US had had significant trade surpluses for the whole post - war period up until this time .
What does all this have to do with the Middle East ?
Well , although after Bretton Woods there was technically no single reserve currency now that the dollar had been unpegged from a gold standard , the US dollar continued to function in this manner .
How ?
Well , the US continued to be the world 's preeminent economy and military power , despite some new weaknesses not seen before the late 1960s .
But also important was the role of " petrodollars . "
Basically - and this is going to be a rather gross simplification for brevity 's and simplicity 's sake - security arrangements with the likes of Saudia Arabia , but also Kuwait , Qatar , and the other Gulf monarchies ( not the United Arab Emirates until 1971 ) meant that these economies bought US hardware - and military hardware - and invested the dollars they earned from selling their oil in US banks .
Why dollars ?
Well , despite the relative decline of the US 's economic dominance from 1945 to the early 1970s , it still remained the world 's dominant economy and largest consumer of petroleum - in both cases by a long distance .
Furthermore , at the time , there was simply no other currency which could play the role the dollar could .
There was no Euro .
Britain was done as a world power .
The Soviet Union had a rigid command economy not conducive or attractive to investors .
So the dollar it would be .
And with the various oil shocks of the 1970s , first seen in 1973 , the world was awash in petrodollars .
Thus the " win-win " situation / relation that had existed between the US and Saudi Arabia , and later , the other gulf kingdoms was reinforced , even if anger in the US amongst consumers at least began to grow .
Two Wars , Religious Fundamentalism , ( and Israel )
So the following deals with the " First Pillar . "
But what about the " Second Pillar , " or Israel ?
Well , the US continued to back Israel and largely for the same reasons it had since Israel 's founding in 1948 .
But some new reasons were beginning to creep into the picture , set in motion largely by Israel 's triumphs in the 1967 , or " 6 Days , " War and the 1973 , or " Yom Kippur , " War .
At the time , both wars were largely seen as the brave new Israeli state fighting heroically for its life against hostile , treachorous neighbors .
And these were generally fair assessments as far it goes .
In both cases , Israel fought a clutch of its Arab neighbors simultaneously .
In the first case , 1967 , Israel launched what is seen as a largely justifiable " pre-emptive strike " ( yes , I know ) against Egyptian forces massing at its border after the Egyptians had expelled a UN force from the Sinai Peninsuala .
The second in 1973 began after Syria and Egypt launched a suprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur ( hence the name ! ) .
In both cases , Israel emerged victorious against what on the surface seemed like long odds .
The result of these two short wars were very significant and were arguably the most important events to occur in the region until the recent US invasion of Iraq ( and the subsequent state collapse ) and this summer 's Lebanon / Israel War .
Why ?
I would argue for three major reasons , not all of which were clearly seen at the time .
Indeed , if you were to ask an American in , say , 1975 what the most important result of the war was , they would have probably announced something about the emergence of the " Arab oil weapon . "
Some of you probably remember personally experiencing the oil shortages of the era , when people waited in line for gas after OPEC boycotted the US after it chose to materially assist Israel in the war .
This was indeed an important outcome .
But my focus here will be otherwise .
Firstly , these wars definetly established Israel as the region 's military power .
This has arguably had several important consequences .
Firstly , it led to a sense of humiliation amongst the various Arab publics ( " how could three or four of our armies lose to just one ! !? " ) , which in turn fatally undermined the secular socialist states that had generally led nations in the region ( and still , rather pathetically , do - see Egypt and Syria ) .
In many cases , a return to religious piety , and then , religious political organization , was seen as the answer to the failure of westernization and modernization .
Also , it discredited the idea that " conventional " Arab armies could defeat or successfully fight Israel .
New tactics needed to be provided .
So , arguably , this would fuel the rise of guerilla warfare / terrorism / 4th gen warfare that characterizes groups like Hezbollah .
Now of course , none of this was obvious at the time and it certainly was n't obvious how it would effect US policy in the region .
Secondly , Israel 's triumphs in these wars meant that Israel took control of some new lands - the Sinai Peninsuala , the Golan Heights , the West Bank , and the Gaza Strip .
Sinai was returned to Egypt when Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979 .
Israel still holds the other territories .
Now , the Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip are important in a regional sense , but they do not hold the importance of the West Bank , and particularly Israel 's capture of all of Jerusalem .
What the capture of Jerusalem did in particular was to provide Israel with a whole new set of " friends " in the United States , with rather different reasons for supporting it than the traditional moral case dating back to 1948 .
Basically , the capture of Jerusalem was seen as a vital step in fulfilling Biblical prophecy by a significant section of American Chrisitianity .
It aroused a newfound interest in the state amongst a particular segment of American Christianity that the original founding of Israel did not , even though this event is also seen as part of a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy .
Perhaps the power of the Israeli capture of Jerusalem should also be seen in the context of a 1970s America where - although religiousity amongst the population as a whole stayed constant or perhaps was even declining - the rise of those adhering to fundamentalist or evangelical traditions that heavily emphasized Biblbical prophecy and pre-millenial dispensationalism was occurring .
Thirdly , Israeli 's military triumphs - in a Cold War realpolitik context - led US policy makers to reassess Israel 's value as a military ally and not just a " moral commitment . "
Basically , a newish paradigm developed where an Israel backed by and allied with the United States would face off with a Syria and an Egypt ( until 1979 ) backed by and allied with the Soviet Union .
Of course , the Soviet Union had once been a backer of Israel , and the United States had once been a backer of Egypt ( see the 1956 Suez Crisis ) .
But the 1967 and 1973 wars changed this equation .
So , just as the collapse of the Bretton Woods framework and the rise of the " petrodollar " deepened the US 's commitment to the " first pillar " of its mid-east strategy ( support and alliance with the Saudis and the other Gulf kingdoms ) , so to did the ' 67 and ' 73 wars lead to a deepening commitment to the " second pillar " of its strategy , Israel .
9/11 and the Fatal Contradictions of the Middle East Paradigm
Now , forgive me , but I am going to fast - forward almost 30 years to the new millenium .
While I hesitate to draw this connection , as there is no direct causation , I think that at least metaphorically speaking , the attacks of September 11 , 2001 are evidence of the fatal contradictions of America 's Middle East Policy paradigm .
On the one hand , inreasingly backing Israel as it actions no matter what it does , while on the other hand continuing to embrace clientelist monarchies and dictatorships as a means of maintaining maximum leverage over the region through its relationship with , at the end of the day , politically submissive regimes .
This includes , of course , Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states , but also Egypt and Jordan , which the US picked up as clients as a means of leveraging both states to sign peace agreements with Israel ( Egypt in 1979 , Jordan in 1994 ) .
Now again , let me refer back to a couple points I have made earlier .
Or rather a point or concept I have a referred to in a couple places - that events that seem innocous or meaningless when they originally happen end up having long term significance .
Indeed , in the 1970s or the 1980s , the idea that supporting strongly Saudi Arabia and Israel simultaneously was a fundamentally untenable proposition would not have necessarily made any sense .
After all , Saudi Arabia has never fought Israel , even if the two nations have never signed a peace treaty .
But the contradictions were always there , below the surface .
Saudi Arabia , with all its money , was buying off its hardline Wahabbi religious establishment while not investing in a properly diversified economy or open society in any substantive way .
It was and is in many ways a sick society still , 5 years after 9/11 .
But to restate the Cold War aphorism , " Its our sick society . "
The proof is in the 9/11 pudding .
Where did the high - jackers come from ?
15 from Saudi Arabia , a US ally ; 1 from Egypt , a US ally ; 1 from Lebanon ( a Lebanese Sunni man ) , a US ally ; and 2 from the United Arab Emirates , a US ally .
Notice a pattern ?
Lets leave out Ziad Jarrah from Lebanon .
The other 18 come from US client states that are either dictatorships or monarchies .
What was the Bush administration 's response to the attacks ?
For all Bush 's talk about the need for " a new policy " towards the region and a need to " reject stability , " the US 's strategy has remained fundamentally the same .
Pursue the fundamental pillars - support for Israel and an attempt to achieve regional hegemony - to a sort of logical extreme .
All the while ignoring that the fundamental incompatibility of these goals is what created 9/11 .
To some how paper over the fundamental illogicality of this , Bush et al. advanced the idea that the problem was a lack of democracy , while willfully ignoring the fact that free elections will lead to the election of politicians fundamentally opposed to both the pre-existing goals which the Bush administration had only more forcefully pursued in the wake of 9/11 .
The contradiction became obvious in the 4 month period that included the very strong Muslim Brotherhood showing in Egypt 's late 2005 Potemkin elections and Hamas 's victory in early 2006 .
This fact was further driven home by the United States 's failed diplomacy surrounding the Lebanon - Israel War this summer .
Basically , the current equation is thus : the US wants regional hegemony ( call it " empire " if you want ) .
But it needs friendly client states to do so .
However , these friendly client states are undemocratic and in some cases deeply illiberal .
There populations are opposed to US policy in the region and to the festering sore of the Israel conflict to boot .
The US 's strategy under Bush is to support Israel more , continue to attempt regional hegemony , and call for elections when it suits them and generally only in hostile regimes .
Simply put , these pieces wo n't fit together anymore .
Something has to give .
The Democrats ?
But the problem is the Democrats have nothing substantive to offer as an alternative , except for occasional opportunistic sniping ( usually deserved ) at the edges and more cutting criticism of Bush 's generally misbeggoten invasion of Iraq .
Why ?
Its because like the GOP , the Democrats - at least the so - called Beltway revolving door types - are also wedded to the " two pillars " just as much as the GOP .
The Democrats and this nation more generally are going to have to make a choice , whether sooner or later .
Which pillar do they want to support ?
Israel or Regional Hegemony ?
The answer to this question should n't be too hard .
( Yes , the right answer is Israel ) .
Yes , in the short run , it would mean surrendering the region to Islamists of various stripes .
But the US is probably going to have to do so anyway eventually , with even greater consequences .
You think things are bad now , but they could get worse .
How about a revolution in Egypt.
Or Saudi Arabia .
Or Pakistan ( admittedly out of the region , but relevant ) .
The fact the US is not liked and its policy of hegemony is not liked cannot be finessed .
It has nothing to do with a few " evil leaders " and everything to do with deep and widely held public opinion in the region .
If its no Iraq or Iran or Syira , it will be someone else .
There is no silver bullet to finesse the fact that the fundamental paradigm that has governed US Middle East policy since WWII is no longer tenable .
We are not in good spot today , but it is not too late .
