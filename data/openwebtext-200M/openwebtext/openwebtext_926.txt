Your attention is everything these days .
As the media and the people in your environment will always find new ways to distract you from what ’s important , it ’s even more important today to maintain your focus .
By doing so , you remain to be “ the eye of the storm , ” calm and focused .
Being focused is more of an art than it is a science .
Here are 9 practical ways to stay focused :
Choose one or two objectives for the year .
I think goal setting is important , but setting too many goals can be a trap .
I spoke to a woman earlier this week that is a friend of mine .
I sensed that she seemed a little confused .
As we got to talking , she told me about the different businesses she works in .
I asked her , “ how many business do you have ? ” and she replied , “ I have three . ”
If you ask me , that ’s two , too many and here ’s why .
Having too many businesses ( or objectives for that matter ) scatters your focus , energy and your actions .
Instead , choose one or two objectives for the year .
In this case it might mean focusing on one business first .
Get it up and running until it runs almost automatic .
Then you ’re ready for your next big project .
Create a daily ritual .
I ’m a Life Direction Coach , but I ’m also a blogger and I have a newsletter .
Since writing is part of the career I choose , I write every morning regardless if I ’m going to publish an article or not .
It ’s become a very powerful morning ritual that keeps me focused .
This daily ritual is the same habit that helped me write my ebook when I was working full time as an engineer .
I wrote every morning for 30 - 60 minutes and finished a 16 page ebook in 8 weeks .
Do the most important first .
Ask yourself , “ Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important ? ”
This works with the 80/20 rule .
20 % of your actions create 80 % of your results .
If that ’s the case , then are you focused on the 20 % that will get you the most powerful results ?
If not , then why not ?
Are you inventing things to avoid the important ?
In most cases , you ’re avoiding the important actions because there is a fear of rejection built into those actions .
Realize this :
You ’ve mastered your life when you know it is n’t important what others think of you – it ’s more important what you think of you .
Take your most important actions today and yield the greatest results .
Give yourself daily quiet time .
I like the way John Assaraf puts it .
He says , “ You want to slow down inside so that everything speeds up on the outside . ”
Take a manual transmission car for example .
When you shift from first to second gear , the engine slows down but the car speeds up .
As you shift from second to third , the engine slows down again , but the car speeds up even more .
You want to do the same thing : slow down on the inside so that you speed up on the outside .
Make it a daily ritual to mediate , breath or visualize every day to become calm of mind .
Trim the fat & eliminate the noise .
Environment plays a big role and affects your inner world ; it can affect your mind .
It affects your inner game .
Do n’t let it .
Get rid of any noise or nuisances that distract you .
If you want to do the heavy lifting you have to trim the fat .
And that means eliminating the distractions in your life that prevent you from staying focused ; things such as : watching the news , listening to media via the radio , surfing the web or checking email excessively .
I spend a maximum of an hour each day surfing the web and most of the time it ’s for research or marketing .
I also check my email twice per day .
Once at mid-day and once at night .
Trim the fat and eliminate the background noise in your life .
Take care of yourself .
You have to remember that if you ’re going to stay focused you must be able to perform .
And you ca n’t perform unless you take care of yourself first .
Make sure to include a daily or at least weekly ritual to experience the things you really enjoy .
In my case that means playing hockey twice per week , getting to the gym and reading inspirational books .
Give yourself the time to do the things you really love to do .
Take care of yourself and you ’ll be able to take care of others .
You ’ll can only give what you got .
Visualize daily .
You could make this part of your daily ritual .
Spend a minimum of 5 minutes daily visualizing your ideal life in all areas .
Vision is the magnet that pulls you along your destination .
It ’s gives you the juice to move towards a bright future instead of pushing against it .
It ’s like rolling downhill instead of pushing uphill .
Having a vision moves you with the current instead of against it .
Stay absolutely focused with a daily visualization .
Complete everything you start .
Make completions a habit .
Finish everything you start .
These are the promises you make to yourself .
If you made a promise to a friend and then did n’t do it , do you think they ’ll trust you ?
It ’s unlikely , but what ’s worse is that you begin to doubt and loose trust in your own self .
And a lack of trust leads to low self confidence and a poor self - image .
If you have a low opinion of your self , how productive do you think you ’ll be ?
Develop your will power .
When you start your daily ritual it ’s going to take will power to stick the routine .
It ’s never easy in the beginning , but with persistence you will develop the daily habits to stay very focused .
Will power is like a muscle , it gets stronger the more you use it .
To get started , burn this quote into your mind :
“ Do something every day for no other reason than you ’d rather not do it or do n’t feel like doing it . ” ~
William James
Start by choosing the daily ritual that will have the greatest impact on your life .
Then commit to it for 30 days .
It may be as simple as visualizing for five minutes every day .
Once you become stronger in one area , you can develop your confidence and your will power in other areas .
Being “ the eye of the storm ” is no easy task , but it can be very simple .
Choose one tip and commit every part of your being to make it happen .
It will make all the difference as you steer your ship through those turbulent waters – and ultimately help you stay focused .
Last month , Yogesh Singh was getting coffee from a machine in a stall while taking a break from helping his father run a tent shop .
He was tired and needed a pick - me - up .

He pressed the buttons and inserted his cup , waiting for his beverage to brew .
But instead of dispensing coffee , the machine rumbled and shook before exploding in Yogesh 's face .
It sent shrapnel and scalding coffee grounds into his head and chest , killing him instantly .
He had just wanted an energy boost , but the coffee machine had other plans .
Maybe relying on the heroes at Starbucks to do such dangerous work is n't such a bad idea .

Machines Behaving Deadly : A week exploring the sometimes difficult relationship between man and technology .
The European commission has launched legal proceedings against the UK government for alleged breach of EU data protection laws caused by controversial internet advertising company Phorm .
Telecoms commissioner Viviane Reding said UK law will have to change to ensure the confidentiality of communications by prohibiting interception and surveillance without a user 's consent .
The move follows months of informal communication between Brussels and the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) about Phorm 's controversial behaviour - targeted advertising technology .
Phorm 's technology enables internet service providers ( ISPs ) to analyse what their users are doing to build up a profile of their interests , which can then be used by advertisers to serve more relevant adverts on websites they subsequently visit .
A year ago , BT admitted it had tested the technology in 2006 and 2007 without informing customers involved in the trial .
That lead to protests from privacy campaigners and several complaints to the commission from individuals and MEPs , which sparked the talks with the ICO .
The technology was subsequently cleared by the ICO , provided consumers were required to opt in to it .
The commission , however , believes the UK law needs to be strengthened to ensure that UK users are asked to give their consent before their data is intercepted .
The commission said it had written several letters to the UK authorities since July 2008 , asking how they had implemented relevant EU laws in the context of the Phorm case .
The EU directive on privacy and electronic communications requires member states to ensure confidentiality of the communications and related traffic data by prohibiting unlawful interception and surveillance unless the users concerned have consented , while the EU data protection directive specifies that user consent must be " freely given , specific and informed " .
The directive also requires member states to establish appropriate sanctions in case of infringement , with independent authorities charged with supervising implementation .
" Following an analysis of the answers received , the commission has concerns that there are structural problems " in the way the UK has implemented these rules , the commission said in a statement .
Under UK law , it is an offence to unlawfully intercept communications .
However , the scope of this offence is limited to " intentional " interception .
Moreover , according to this law , interception is also considered to be lawful when the interceptor has " reasonable grounds for believing " that consent to interception has been given .
The commission said it is concerned that the UK does not have an independent national supervisory authority that deals with such interceptions .
The Office of Surveillance Commissioners , which oversees conduct of covert surveillance , only looks after public authorities while the ICO , which looks after issues such as data protection , cannot enforce the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) , which covers interception .
" Technologies like internet behavioural advertising can be useful for businesses and consumers but they must be used in a way that complies with EU rules .
These rules are there to protect the privacy of citizens and must be rigorously enforced by all member states , " said Reding .
" We have been following the Phorm case for some time and have concluded that there are problems in the way the UK has implemented parts of EU rules on the confidentiality of communications .
" I call on the UK authorities to change their national laws and ensure that national authorities are duly empowered and have proper sanctions at their disposal to enforce EU legislation on the confidentiality of communications .
This should allow the UK to respond more vigorously to new challenges to e-privacy and personal data protection , such as those that have arisen in the Phorm case .
It should also help reassure UK consumers about their privacy and data protection while surfing the internet . "
The UK has two months to reply and if it does not – or if its response is deemed inadequate – the commission may decide to issue a " reasoned opinion " calling for changes to the law .
If that fails to work , the UK could be taken before the European court of justice and forced to change the law .

The current crisis has revealed the Keynesian roots of mainstream economics .
The only debate has been the type and size of bailouts and stimulus packages .
For example , Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University thinks nationalization is preferable to the Geithner - Summers toxic - asset - relief plan .
The Keynesian fantasy is really a monomania because ultimately it is a fixation on a single panacea — more government spending .
Meanwhile , the Austrians have the opposite set of policy guidelines and have heroically held to their recipe of liquidation .
The high degree of unanimity among mainstream economists in support of the bailouts and stimulus packages came into sharp relief at the recent convention of the American Economic Association .
In addition to this unanimity , mainstream economists have become more influential and powerful than ever before .
For example , Paul Krugman , the most recent Nobel laureate in economics and columnist for the New York Times , supports the stimulus packages to combat the recession .
No matter how many new plans are offered , his only complaint is that it is not enough .
Krugman 's former colleague at Princeton University , Ben Bernanke , who is now in charge of the Federal Reserve , believes that if he can fix the problems in the " financial economy " he can prevent problems spreading to the " real economy . "
Larry Summers , former economist and president of Harvard University is now President Obama 's director of the National Economic Council and presumably the coordinator of plans to address the economic crisis .
It is interesting to note that Summers is the son of two academic economists and is the nephew of Nobel laureates , Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow .
He is also considered a mentor of Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner , who worked under Summers in the Treasury department during the Clinton administration .
All this suggests to me that this crisis is a " market test " for mainstream economics .
Never before have so many academic economists held such primary roles in the economic policy of the federal government .
If we include the two outsiders , Stiglitz and Krugman , with the two powerful insiders , Bernanke and Summers , we get a good sample of the elite mainstream economics .
Given that Congress has voted on very few of the many measures to address the economic crisis , this economic team , including Secretary Geithner , is presumably responsible for designing the bulk of the responses to the crisis .
Their responses amount to Keynesian economics on steroids .
In the last quarter of 2007 , there were the typical interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve .
Then , in January 2008 , the first of the unprecedented moves came from Bernanke when the Fed began auctioning off reserves at the discount window .
This was followed by one unprecedented response after another , bailouts , stimulus , and government guarantees , such as increasing FDIC insurance coverage on bank deposits and extending it to money - market mutual funds , but it all amounts to trillions of dollars of more government spending .
Obama did not really bring " change " ; he only increased the magnitude and speed of the policy responses .
Bailouts , stimulus packages and guarantees should be seen as a kind of backdoor protectionism .
Washington is protecting Wall Street ; it 's protecting the banks ; it 's protecting the auto companies ; and it 's protecting " jobs " in general .
Foreigners have already raised concerns about this bailout - style protectionism and the potential of a global trade war .
Of course , if you make this point to one of the elite economists in Washington , they would scoff and deny the charge .
Why ?
Because every economist — even mainstream economists — knows that protectionism will just make the problems worse .
The Smoot - Hawley Tariff made the Great Depression much worse , and such increased protectionism can lead to trade wars .
The Austrian recipe for economic crisis is very simple and requires little action on the part of government .
It only seems " hard " because of the presumption that the Keynesian approach could possibly be less painful .
However , if you understand that the Austrian recipe is correct — that it would produce quicker and better results , and that the Keynesian approach is a recipe for disaster — then it is the obvious course to take .
Here are the passive ingredients of the Austrian recipe :
Allow liquidation of bankrupt firms and debt ( no bailouts )
Allow prices to fall ( no monetary inflation )
Do not prop up employment ( no stimulus ) Give no assurances against failure ( no nationalizations of GSEs or expanding FDIC coverage )
Do not subsidize unemployment ( no extending of unemployment insurance )
Do not discourage " hoarding , " i.e. , saving
This recipe will produce the quickest possible recovery and minimize the magnitude of economic pain .
The active side of the Austrian policy response would be to reduce the size of government , budget , taxes , and regulations .
It should be pretty obvious that the Austrians and mainstream / Keynesians have polar opposite views when it comes to solving the current economic crisis .
To see how it might turn out , let us take a look back in American economic history .
The Next Super Cycle ?
Mainstream economics identifies turns in the business cycle with the National Bureau of Economic Research 's dating of American business cycles .
In the table of cycle dating , the center column is the length of contractions in months .
It appears to suggest that contractions are becoming shorter in duration while expansions have become longer in duration .
However , there are many significant problems with NBER 's cycle dating .
One problem to note is that the NBER dating obscures what I call " super cycles , " which should not be confused with Kondratiev or Elliot Wave cycles .
The first of these super cycles is the Progressive Era when a host of radical changes were made to the Constitution , government , and the economy .
This super cycle encompasses the five cycles from 1907 to 1921 .
The second super cycle was the Great Depression from 1929 through World War II and the third super cycle was the Great Stagflation of the 1970s , which lasted from 1970 to 1982 .
Another problem is how best to measure the economy over the business cycle .
NBER looks at many factors in its dating of peaks , troughs , and recessions , but it largely boils down to GDP .
One problem with this approach is that over time government spending has increased relative to the private sector , rising from just a few percent to a large minority of all spending in the economy .
Federal government spending is less susceptible to cutbacks during recessions due to government 's power to run budget deficits , tax , and inflate .
The large amounts of government spending automatically makes more recent cycles seem less severe than older cycles when measured in terms of GDP .
However , government spending does not have its value tested with consumers in the market , and much of the spending is actually bad for the economy .
Government could pay people to dig ditches and other people to fill the same ditches , and it would increase GDP , but no one argues this is the path to prosperity .
Austrians would argue that such ditch digging and filling are actually better for the economy than what government actually does with our money .
Murray Rothbard addressed the problem of measuring a big government economy with the concept of private product remaining ( with producers ) , or PPR , which basically takes GDP and subtracts from it twice the amount of government spending .
Government spending is subtracted once to obtain gross private product and it is subtracted again to account for all the resources that government has siphoned off from the private sector .
For example , applying PPR to the stagflation super cycle of the 1970s , we find that PPR ( adjusted for inflation ) increased from $ 600 billion in 1969 to merely $ 729 billion in 1982 .
That means there was anemic average economic growth of less than 1.4 % per year during this period .
Rothbard then accounts for the increase in population by looking at the number of producer - breadwinners in the private sector ( not government employees ) .
Using calculations provided by Robert Batemarco , Real PPR per productive worker actually fell from $ 9,134 in 1969 to just $ 8,708 in 1982 .
What first appears to be four short contractions in the NBER dating system turned out to be an economic nightmare for the average American .
On top of lower real incomes , when adjusted for inflation , the value of stocks fell by more than 50 % during this period .
The three super cycles of the 20th century therefore coincided with the rise of the Progressives , the New Dealers , and the Keynesians .
In contrast , if we look at normal recessions , where the country is not at war , is on the gold standard , and where Keynesian policy is not dominant , we find a much different story .
For example , the recessions of 1953 – 1954 , 1957 –1958 , and 1960 – 1961 were short in duration , shallow in depth , and followed by robust growth .
In terms of real GDP , economic growth briefly turned negative by one percent in the first and third recessions and by 2.5 % in the second recession , which was the briefest of the three .
If we look at the three recessions in terms of real PPR ( per producer ) we find that the first recession did not produce an annual decrease , but an increase of 2.7 % in 1954 , and more than a 5 % increase in 1955 .
The second recession shows an annual drop of 2 % in 1958 and a 6 % increase in 1959 .
The final recession shows an annual drop of 2 % in 1960 , an increase of 2 % in 1961 , and an increase of 4.5 % in the year following the recession .
The housing bubble peaked in July 2005 .
Private investment , a leading indicator of the economy , peaked at the end of 2006 .
As worsening conditions in the home building industry spread , the economy stumbled in late 2006 and again in late 2007 before falling into clear depression in 2008 .
The size and scope of the Keynesian policy remedies employed since late 2007 have been unprecedented .
With the renaissance of Keynesian economics we can only conclude that the preconditions for a new super cycle have been established , and that if the policies are not reversed we face many years of depressed economic conditions .

Bill Francis , a research librarian at the Baseball Hall of Fame , passed this article on to Michael Chabon , who passed it on to me .

Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The other shoe has finally dropped on that court decision which forced the Federal Communications Commission to delay its green light to Broadband over Power Line technology ( BPL ) .
The American Radio Relay League ( ARRL ) , which successfully sued the FCC over its go - ahead , has obtained and published a small pile of nonredacted versions of studies that the Commission claimed supported its pro-BPL position .
The nonredacted documents , ARRL charges , offer a different assessment of the technology .
For example , a redacted page ( page one ) from an FCC study of one BPL system 's emissions rate ( Main.net ) concludes that it exceeded required limits , but " if distance were based on distance to the wire rather than the nearest part of the BPL system , measurements would have passed with 1 dB margin at the selected quasi- peak measurement location . "
What a relief !
There 's only one little problem .
The unredacted version of the document ( page two ) , now made public thanks to an ARRL Freedom of Information Act request , includes a parenthesis that was whited out of the comment .
So the full sentence reads ( we 've added the emphasis ) :
" if distance were based on distance to the wire rather than the nearest part of the BPL system ( a suggestion made by Main .
Net 's CTO , but which we consider to be invalid ) , measurements would have passed with 1 dB margin at the selected quasi- peak measurement location . "
No adversity please
It gets even weirder , but first let 's review the background on this case .
BPL , essentially a means of transmitting broadband along electrical current lines , was supposed to be the next big thing — a " third pipe " alternative to cable and DSL .
But the market for it has been slow , and ham radio operators , led by the ARRL , charged that the service caused receiver interference .
Finally a federal court took a look at the dispute and in April of 2008 agreed that the five studies used by the FCC to back its non-interference claims were full of redaction , so to speak .
The Administrative Procedures
Act requires the agency to make the whole of these studies public , the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled , not just selected portions .
Here , one judge declared , " there is little doubt that the Commission deliberately attempted to ' exclude [ ] from the record evidence adverse to its position ' . "
This month ARRL got its hands on the clean studies .
Here 's another example .
Page one of this document measuring the field strength of a BPL system component concludes that its " Plotted field strength is 95th percentile spectral bin within emission band of specified DUT for average . "
But do you see that great big blank box on the lower left of the page ?
That 's a redacted comment .
Scroll down to page two and you 'll see the unredacted version of the page , which reveals the whited out text :
*** NOT A POINT SOURCE ***

" FCC Part 15 emission limits were
developed for point sources , i.e. for emissions from a single point , " ARRL Chief Executive Officer David Sumner told Ars. " A BPL
system uses wires , which of course are lines and not points and which radiate
from along the line .
What the FCC staff studies showed was that BPL is not a
point source , and so the interference from a BPL device does not decay in the
same way as a point source .
It decays more slowly . "
Ditto for this page , which the agency completely blanked , except for the Powerpoint slide title : " Conclusions Regarding Access BPL . "
The unredacted version on page two says : " The tested overhead PLC devices do not act as point sources .
Emission from line shows virtually no decay 230 m from coupler .
Differential two - wire signal injection affects the polarization of radiated emissions from overhead devices . "
On the ARRL 's comparison page , Sumner says his organization has only begun to explore these papers .
" We are continuing to analyze all the documents and we 'll see just what has been going on , " he promised .
The appeals court 's procedural ruling remanded the controversy back to the FCC , which suggests that the agency could reissue its 2004 Order once it makes the relevant documents fully public .
But it 's unclear what the court or the FCC will do if it becomes obvious that the unredacted studies offer a meaningfully different assessment of the interference problem .
Even the ARRL is circumspect in its analysis , however , cautiously suggesting that the unredacted docs " may not support [ the FCC's ] own conclusions regarding BPL . "
How " adverse " does the evidence have to be to compel the agency to change course ?
Hat tip to Broadband Reports for this story .
Retired military officers are urging the U.S. to get serious about changing the country 's approach to energy use .
Nellis AFB hosts one of the largest solar arrays
In a new report from Alexandria , Va. - based Center for Naval Analyses , a bevy of high - ranking former Army and Navy officials stress that the country 's reliance on oil poses a threat to national security and undermines the country 's ability to wage war .
That 's because the hegemony of oil empowers plenty of dodgy nations , and because it imposes huge ( and expensive ) logistics strains on the U.S. military , as made clear in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The report calls for the Pentagon to lead a shift away from oil and toward renewable sources of energy -- not so much to save the planet as to make it easier to defend .
The stress on energy and national security is n't surprising .
National Security Adviser James Jones ' former gig involved drafting a new blueprint for changing America 's energy mix to boost security .
What 's really interesting about the report is that it highlights how important the Pentagon could be in blazing a new energy trail .
The U.S. Department of Defense is the world 's single - largest energy consumer , so any shift in energy use by the Pentagon automatically has massive repercussions .
That 's especially true when it comes to new technologies :

Ron Paul : Secession is " very American "
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) is standing behind his governor , Rick Perry , saying Perry was on firm constitutional ground when he suggested the Lone Star State might secede to protest Democratic spending and tax policy .
( h/t HuffPo's Sam Stein )
Paul , in a video post on his Campaign for Liberty PAC , says the secession debate " is worth a discussion : "
" [ Perry ] really stirred some of the liberal media , where they started screaming about : ' what is going on here , this is un-American . '
I heard one individual say ' this is treasonous to even talk about it . '
Well , they do n't know their history very well , because when you think about it ... it is very American to talk about secession .
That 's how we came in being .
Thirteen colonies seceded from the British and established a new country .
So secession is a very much American principle .
What about all the strong endorsements we have give the past decade or two to all the republics that seceded from the soviet system ?
We were delighted about it . "
The libertarian Republican says " right now the American people are sick and tired of it all . "
Gallup disagrees — reporting that Obama has averaged a 63 percent approval rating in the first quarter .
Paul netted only 5 percent of the vote in the 2008 Texas GOP presidential primary .
His tallies in other states ranged from zero to 25 percent , and he did best in small - population western states with strong libertarian movements .

Top U.S. officials recently made public concerns that Pakistan may be ramping up its nuclear weapons capability , despite a looming civil war .
Now we have some visual evidence : Satellite imagery that appears to show the expansion of Pakistan 's plutonium production program and a possible increase in stocks of weapons - grade uranium .
Commercial satellite images released today by the Institute for Science and International Security – a very credible source for arms control analysis – appear to underscore Pakistan 's determination to increase its supply of fissile material and develop more destructive nuclear weapons .
Most worryingly , the report suggests that Pakistan may be on the path to creating thermonuclear weapons that would be more powerful and potentially easier to package in a warhead .
Among the findings : Pakistan appears to have increased its plutonium separation capability at a site near Rawalpindi .
According to ISIS , the new construction seems to indicate that Pakistan will be increasing its supply of spent fuel from new heavy water reactors , providing the raw material for separating out fissile plutonium .
The country is also apparently expanding a facility at Dera Ghazi Khan that produces uranium hexafluoride and uranium metal , two basic ingredients for producing the bomb .
Ramping up these nuclear facilities , ISIS notes , is " likely linked to a strategic decision to improve the destructiveness and deliverability of its nuclear arsenal . "
Take , for instance , the focus on plutonium production : A plutonium fission device can be used as the " primary " ( i.e. , as the trigger ) for a staged weapon that would set off a thermonuclear " secondary . "
That 's scary enough ; but equally troubling is the potential vulnerability of these nuclear sites .
As ISIS notes , the Dera Ghazi Khan facility , or the nearby workers ' compound , " has been the target of at least one ground attack by more than a dozen gunmen , and nearby railway tracks have also been bombed . "
Those attacks , the report notes , were likely carried out by Baloch separatists , not Taliban extremists , but the attacks underscore Pakistan 's fragile state .

The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film , and the animation studio did not disappoint .
An adventurous boy and a cranky man travel by unusual means in the new Pixar film " Up. " more photos »
Pixar , which has produced such gems as " Toy Story , " " The Incredibles " and " WALL - E , " introduced its latest feature , " Up , " on Wednesday night at the French movie celebration .
By critics ' reckonings , Pixar has never released a bad film , and those who saw " Up , " its 10th feature , say the studio's perfect record is still intact .
The film is a " captivating odd - couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along , " wrote Variety 's Todd McCarthy .
" The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old , and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that . "

" It 's a terrific family adventure , " wrote Peter Bradshaw of Britain 's The Guardian .
" The 3 - D presentation gives it a real boost , but this film is airborne because of the traditional strengths : story , characterization and inventive animation with the old - fashioned values of clarity and simplicity . "

" Up " concerns Carl Fredericksen , a balloon seller voiced by Ed Asner .
Faced with eviction after his wife dies , Fredericksen decides to uproot himself -- literally -- by attaching hundreds of balloons to his house and flying it to South America .
However , it turns out he 's not alone .
A stowaway -- a Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell ( voiced by Jordan Nagai ) -- is in the house as well , and the two of them become mutually dependent after landing a continent away .
The film opens May 29 in the United States .
Cannes audiences are notoriously vocal .
They 'll whistle if they 're unhappy -- a French version of a boo -- and a movie that does n't meet the audience 's high standards will be treated to the repeated " whop " sounds of theater seats banging shut as patrons leave .
" Up , " on the other hand , received little but cheers .
CNN 's Natasha Curry , who 's at the festival , reports a morning screening concluded with applause .
It 's an unlikely film to be opening Cannes .
Not only is it animated , it 's animated by computer -- and , in some theaters , it will be shown in 3 - D .
Those are all firsts for a Cannes curtain raiser .
But the Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan told CNN that " Up " fits in with Cannes ' aspirations .
" Cannes likes to be seen as innovative , likes to be seen as embracing something new , " Turan observed .
" But really the reason ' Up ' is opening the festival is not because it 's animated , not because it 's 3 - D , it 's ... because it 's a wonderful film .
[ Festival organizers ] saw that , and I 'm sure they liked the fact that they could do something avant - garde in terms of technique , but really it 's a wonderful story , it 's a terrific film and that 's why it 's opening . "
Turan said he sees Pixar 's work , and its recognition by Cannes , as another sign that animated features are among the best films being produced right now .
" The Pixar films , the Hayao Miyazaki films from Japan , the Wallace and Gromit films from Britain -- we 're really living in the golden age of animation , one of the great ages of animation in the whole history of film , " he said .
" And Cannes is happy to be part of that .
Cannes is happy to recognize that . "

If a Web site were to be designed by a PC manufacturer to market its laptops and netbooks to men , what would it look like ?
Would the tips section be full of pointers on how to stream porn ?
Or how to check sports scores more efficiently on a shrunken screen ?
Doubtful , because men already know how to use a laptop , right ?
It also would perpetuate a stereotype that all men partake in those activities at their computers .
And of course , we all know that not all men spend their time at the computer scouring the Interwebs for dirty pictures of Miss California .
Tell me then .
Why has America 's top PC manufacturer , Dell , created a site for women about their computer use ?
The Austin , Texas company launched Della , a site to market its newest and uber - stylish laptops to women .
The page , which reminds me of a birth control ad in a magazine , is blanketed with images of very attractive women using Dell - branded notebooks like the XPS 13 and the Inspiron Mini 10 .
The Tech Tips page , with its patronizing " Seven Unexpected Ways a Netbook Can Change Your Life , " is full of stereotypes of how women ’s lives can be changed with a mini-notebook .
( I 'd be the first to admit netbooks have life - changing qualities , but really ?
Really ?! )
“ Track your exercise and food intake at free online sites like Fitday , ” is Tip Number One , like any self - respecting women 's magazine would recommend .
Number two : Find recipes online ( just because we have laptops does n't mean we do n't still belong in the kitchen ) .
Dell , is this all you think us women do with our laptops ?
Or do you think women are that slow at the technology uptake that we do n’t know that a netbook is capable of these activities ?
The word " choice " itself is downright demeaning .
Not only are netbooks described as " cute , " but on Dell.com , the Dell Inspiron Mini 12 is described with terms including " productive . "
On the Della portal the Mini 12 allows you to " stay connected to your favorite entertainment including email , shopping and more . "
Again , do you think all us women do is pull out the plastic ?
I commend companies , especially Dell with its new Adamo and its Design Studio , for making products that are more aesthetically pleasing and thus more appealing to women .
It 's a huge step beyond painting a laptop pink and saying it 's now for the fairer sex .
However , creating a Web site that tells women these products are for our shopping habits and cooking for our men puts us in an even worse place than those pink - covered laptops were in to begin with : as unsophisticated , separate and non-equal tech users compared with men .
This site presumes that women have different computing " needs , " as if we do n't know how to use a " real " laptop .
The stereotypes reinforced in this campaign are appalling .
Guess what , Dell ?
Women ARE tech - savvy and should n’t be placed in a separate box when it comes to technology .
We want options just like men , and notebooks that pack power , functionality and , YES , style .
We do n't need a Petitcoat 5 or a separate site telling us women , and us women alone , how to make the best " use " of a laptop .
I do n't see Dell creating a site marketing its laptops or netbooks to men any time soon , so it is my hope that we can say Ciao to Della , very soon .

Beginner chess players often get disheartened by the amount of time they are taking to improve on their play .
After knowing the basic things like moves of different pieces , relative values of pieces , the rules of capture , castling and then a little higher tactics like knight fork , pin , discovered check , double check , stalemate etc. , they find that they are still not able to make much headway against experienced players .
Some of the common complaints may be like :
I cannot remember all those sequence of moves in an opening
I tend to overlook things like opponent ’s KB moving to g7 plans to capture my Rook at a1
I cannot visualize the position that will arise after next two moves and may be something similar to these .
The ability to calculate and work out combinations are of course at a more difficult level and cannot be achieved through this exercise .
But if you could at least overcome the basic hurdles , you can see some perceptible improvement .
And any mental improvement will take you one or more steps up .
If you think of the mental blocks that I described above , you will realize that the solution to those essentially lies in developing your memory and observation power .
Once this process starts , it will help you to absorb more from your studies and games , setting you on your way to be a much better player .
What is the exercise that can help you in these areas ?
This exercise is to be done at bed time .
But many people have a habit of watching tv or reading books or whatever , when they go to bed .
Well , there will ulimately be a point when you are trying to close your eyes and go to sleep .
I actually meant this point of time when I said bed time !
When you are trying to fall asleep , you normally experience all kinds of random thoughts passing through your mind and in between you will be in a half - awake half - sleepy kind of phase till sleep finally takes over .
In your exercise , you will banish those random thoughts and focus on what all you did in their proper sequence from the moment you woke up in the morning till your moment of sleep ( do n’t worry , the apparent contradiction will not happen as you will fall asleep before you reach the end point ! )
Is that all ?
Yes , that ’s all there is to it .
But the stipulation in this exercise is that you should try to see ( visualize ) and remember each and every activity , conversation , thoughts , people you met and so on .
It is like you have made a video recording of your whole day and you are playing the video in your mind .
Go to as much detail as you can recall .
When you start , that mind video will be in a fast forward mode .
You will find that you are unable to remember what else you did when you were brushing your teeth ( looking in the mirror , thinking on things to do , … ) and then the scene shifts to possibly mid-afternoon in your workplace and then jumps back to your starting the car or taking the metro , and shift again to some other point .
That is why I stressed that you must try to remember in correct sequence !
During initial few days , you will be surprised to find how little you remember even when you thought it was a busy day !
Only some big “ lumps ” , particularly those which had some impact , will come to your mind without many details .
But if you continue to do it , you will progressively start remembering more of your day .
Your aim should be to go to the extent where you can visualize in a scene the people who were present , the conversations you had , the pictures that were hanging on the walls , the signboards you saw when you were walking on the road , even the thoughts you had … you get the point ?
What is your mind achieving in this exercise ?
A greater power of observation , the ability to see details , and increase in memory power through your effort in remebering , which is but a memory exercise .
An amusing thing also will come to your notice .
Once you start doing it , you will feel a challenge and urge to remember more of your day .
And as you know that you have to remember your day at bedtime , you will be more aware of what you are doing or thinking at any point of time !
See , that becomes an exercise for your power of observation .
Another benefit , if you are bit of insomniac , is that you will fall asleep without a need to count sheep .
Our subconscious mind is like a monkey jumping from branch to branch .
When your conscious mind tries to focus it , you are trying to tie up the monkey .
To regain its freedom , the subconscious will try to put you to sleep so that the conscious mind loses its control and the subconscious is free again to jump ( i.e. , dream ) to its liking .
Keep doing this exercise and very soon you will feel the difference it has made to your mental faculty !

Do not read this post if you 're taking a commuter plane anytime soon
Why ?
Because if you do you 'll have that same depressed feeling you get after reading an article about commercial chicken farms , in that case determining to never again eat chicken in any way , shape or form .
Until the memory fades and there you are again with your nuggets .
Fair warning .
A May 16 , 2009 New York Times story which appeared on yesterday 's dead tree version front page strips away the illusion and makes you understand why the laws on interns working without sleep were passed .

Pilots ' Lives Defy Glamorous Stereotype
Alex Lapointe , a 25 - year - old co-pilot for a regional airline , says he routinely lifts off knowing he has gotten less sleep than he needs .
And once or twice a week , he says , he sees the captain next to him struggling to stay alert .
Neil A. Weston , also 25 , went $ 100,000 into debt to train for a co-pilot ’s job that pays him $ 25,000 annually .
He carries sandwiches in a cooler from his home in Dubuque , Iowa , bought his first uniform for $ 400 , and holds out hope of tripling his salary by moving into the captain ’s seat , then up to a major carrier .
Assuming , that is , the majors start hiring again .
Capt .
Paul Nietz , 58 , who recently retired from a regional airline , said his schedule wore him down and cost him three marriages .
His workweek typically began with a 2:30 a.m. wake - up in northern Michigan and a 6 a.m. flight to his Chicago home bases .
There , he would wait for his first assignment , a noon departure .
By the time he parked his aircraft at the last gate of the night , he was exhausted .
But he would be due back at work eight hours and 15 minutes later .
“ At the very most , if you ’re the kind of person that could walk into a hotel room , strip and lay down , you might get four and a half hours of sleep , ” he said .
“ And I was very senior .
I was one of the fortunate guys . ”
The National Transportation Safety Board 's inquiry into the Feb. 12 crash of Continental Connection Flight 3407 outside Buffalo [ top ] has highlighted the operations of the nation ’s regional airlines , a sector of the aviation industry that has grown to account for half the country ’s airline flights and a quarter of its passengers .
The details of that world have surprised many Americans — the strikingly low pay for new pilots ; the rigors of flying multiple flights , at lower altitudes and thus often in worse weather than pilots on longer routes , while scrambling to get enough sleep ; the relative inexperience of pilots at the smaller airlines , whose training standards are the same , but whose skills may not be .
In hearings last week in Washington , witnesses and safety officials raised questions of whether the crew of the plane that crashed , killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground , had been adequately vetted and whether they might have been hampered by , among other factors , fatigue .
But regardless of whether training , fatigue or the cost - cutting that has hit the entire industry are ultimately determined to have contributed to the crash of Flight 3407 , interviews with current and former regional pilots make vividly clear the daily challenges they face .
Peek inside a crew lounge at midnight in Chicago , and one could easily find every recliner occupied by an off - duty aviator trying to sleep despite the whine of a janitor ’s vacuum cleaner .
In any city with a sizable air hub , a search of Craigslist for the term “ crash pad ” will turn up listings for rooms for rent , often for $ 200 a month or less , a short drive from an airport , where a dozen or more pilots , unable to afford hotels , may come and go , barely letting the mattresses cool .
But many regional pilots , paid entry - level wages that are sometimes no better than a job at McDonald ’s , can not afford even a crash pad .
“ I know a guy who bought a car that barely ran and parked it in the employee lot at his base airport , and slept in his car six or seven times a month , ” said Frank R. Graham Jr. , a former regional pilot and airline safety director who runs a safety consulting firm in Charlotte , N.C. Pilots for some regional airlines have been known to sleep in the aisles of their planes .
Like the two Flight 3407 pilots , who caught free rides on planes from Florida and Seattle to their flight from Newark to Buffalo , pilots at regional airlines routinely hopscotch across thousands of miles to get to work .
Some live with their parents , as the plane ’s first officer , Rebecca L. Shaw , did .
Others , like Mr. Lapointe , live near former bases of operations that were shut down because an employer went out of business or a route was dropped .
Mr. Lapointe lives in Wakefield , Mass. , 15 minutes from his old base in Boston .
Since November , he has had to get himself to Kennedy International Airport in New York .
For Captain Nietz , a 27 - year veteran , the biggest indignity was flying hungry .
Delays were so routine that he seldom left his plane all day long , even “ to grab a biscuit . ”
With food service long discontinued , he said , the only bites to be had were “ the occasional peanut — and the airlines charge the crews for bags of peanuts and cheese and crackers . ”
The renewed worries over commuter planes come as passenger airlines , regional and mainline , have achieved unprecedented levels of safety .
Passenger deaths per million flights are down by more than two - thirds in the last 10 years .
The 49 people on board the Buffalo flight were the first in 30 months to die during a scheduled flight on a passenger carrier .
But of the six scheduled passenger flights that have crashed since Sept. 11 , 2001 , only one has been from a major carrier .
Four , including the one in Buffalo , were commuter flights ; a total of 133 people died on those flights .
( The fifth , a 50 - year - old seaplane in Miami , was in neither category . )
And one of the worries about commuter pilots , fatigue , is also a problem for the mainline carriers ; in fact , in some operations , the big airlines are more vulnerable .
They are now conducting flights of 16 hours , across more time zones than a pilot can be expected to adapt to .
Senator Bryron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota , who is chairman of the subcommittee on aviation , said Thursday that the group would hold a series of hearings next month .
He said he was “ stunned ” by the Buffalo crew ’s lack of sleep and relative inexperience .
“ We need to understand , is this an aberration , or are standards sufficiently lax or insufficient , or insufficiently enforced that we need to be concerned about a much broader set of issues ? ” he said .
There is nothing wrong with commuting cross-country to fly , said Roger Cohen , the president of the Regional Airline Association , a trade group ; after all , he pointed out , Capt .
Chesley B. Sullenberger III , the US Airways pilot who ditched his crippled Airbus A320 in the Hudson River on Jan. 15 , lives in Danville , Calif. , and is based in Charlotte , N.C .
Mr. Cohen said he did not know what fraction of pilots commuted long distances to the city where they were , in airline parlance , “ domiciled . ”
“ Anywhere from 50 to 70 percent , pick a number , ” he said .
But he said he did not think that number differed much between regional carriers and mainline carriers .
The Federal Aviation Administration , while it enforces one set of safety standards , says it does not know how the safety of the commuter airlines compares to the safety of the big carriers .
It is working on that question because of the planned Senate hearings .
To the extent that Senator Dorgan ’s hearings address pilot fatigue , they will not be the first such effort .
In 1995 , under pressure from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Air Line Pilots Association , the F.A.A. proposed shortening pilots ’ workdays and redefining duty hours to include the time spent getting from plane to hotel and back .
But the airlines , which deny that pilot fatigue is a significant problem , opposed the changes , and the agency eventually backed off .
Patrick Smith , an airline pilot and aviation writer who spent years at a regional carrier , acknowledged that fatigue is a murky problem , with many causes and varying effects on different pilots , that is difficult to nail down as the main cause of an accident .
“ But the fact that you ca n’t make this easy and direct link is n’t reason to ignore the problem , ” he said .
“ Obviously it ’s there . ”
For Mr. Weston , the 25 - year - old pilot from Dubuque , life in the regional air business is a little like being an extra in a movie .
The planes he flies some days are labeled United Connection , others Delta Express .
But his employer is an airline few people have ever heard of : Republic .
It is a quick hop by air but a six - hour drive from home to his base in Indianapolis , where he stays overnight with an aunt before starting his four - day workweek .
His workdays run 12 hours , sometimes 16 , far from home .
He said this really was a dream job for him and many of his fellow pilots , even though some have to hold down second jobs .
Asked if he flew for pleasure , he laughed .
“ I ca n’t afford it , ” he said .

The Scary Skies
Frightening revelations at hearings on crash of Continental Connection Flight 3407
Aviation experts say that airplane crashes are usually the result of a collection of failures .
After three days of hearings last week into the crash of Buffalo - bound Continental Connection Flight 3407 on the snowy night of Feb. 12 , we know that the frightening failures began long before the doomed turboprop plane took off from Newark , N.J .
The details that emerged should make even the most experienced air traveler nervous .
Capt .
Marvin Renslow , 47 , listed just one of the three times he failed a critical pilot test when applying for a job with Colgan Air , the operator of the crashed airliner .
He failed twice more after he was hired .
First Officer Rebecca Shaw , 24 , had gone 36 hours without proper rest ( regulations require eight hours of rest before flying ) by commuting from her home in Seattle on two flights .
The hearings revealed that 78 of the 137 Newark - based pilots for Colgan had commutes ranging from more than 400 miles to more than 1,000 miles .
Both Mr. Renslow and Ms. Shaw apparently violated company rules by sleeping in the crew lounge at the Newark airport .
So low were their wages that they each had at one time held side jobs while working for the airline .
Mr. Renslow ( $ 55,000 ) stocked grocery shelves in a store near his Tampa home ; Ms. Shaw ( $ 16,200 ) worked in a coffee shop .
The problems in the cockpit were astounding .
Cockpit voice recorders picked up Mr. Renslow and Ms. Shaw chitchatting about their lives and careers , in violation of federal regulations that prohibit nonessential conversation below 10,000 feet .
They were on their final approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport in the middle of a snowstorm when Ms. Shaw said , " I 've never seen icing conditions .
I 've never de-iced .
. . .
I 've never experienced any of that . "
They were oblivious to the ice buildup on the plane 's wings and to the rapid decline in airspeed .
Only the shaking of the pilot 's yoke got Mr. Renslow 's attention .
But instead of allowing the plane to descend to pick up speed , he yanked the nose of the aircraft up .
The plane crashed seconds later , killing all 49 on board and one person on the ground .
Regional air carriers are an essential part of American air travel .
According to the Regional Airline Association , about half the scheduled flights in the United States are flown by them , and 74 percent of the nation 's airports are served only by regional airlines .
The association says that its members must meet the same safety standards for training , maintenance and flight operations that the Federal Aviation Administration sets for large commercial airlines .
But as last week 's hearings made horrifically clear , there 's a gap between what is supposed to be and what is .
Considering that the past five crashes of commercial passenger aircraft in this country have all been of regional carriers , we hope that the shocking testimony leads to increased vigilance that will close that gap .

But thanks anyway .

Wow !
Commuter planes scare me almost as much as the ad currently running on this page !
Note : I have nothing against Scientology any more than any other cult .
Attending both wacky Buddhist Sanghas and Quaker meetings ... I 'm probably as much of a cult member as any one else ... but if we do n't call out the other cults , we would be doing our own a disservice !

Intel renewed its netbook push Tuesday with the formal announcement of its next - generation Atom platform , codenamed Pine Trail .
The details of Pine Trail , including the late 2009 launch date , had already been widely leaked , and today 's disclosure provided little new information .
But for those who have n't followed the Pineview leaks , I 'll break down the details of what was announced .
Pine Trail 's CPU , Pineview ( confusing , I know ) , is a more highly integrated version of Atom that puts the memory controller and GPU on the same die as the CPU .
As the diagram below shows , this move will shrink the number of chips in the Atom platform from three to just two .
Pine Trail architecture ; Image source : Intel
The reduced number of chips results in a cheaper platform with a lower power draw .
So Pineview - based netbooks and MIDs will have improved battery life ; or alternately , Intel could choose to increase the clockspeed and performance of the processor core and keep the overall platform within the same power envelope .
Given that Atom 's performance is still on the low end of " acceptable " ( depending on your needs ) , my bet is that many netbook makers will push for the latter option .
The Pineview processor is a 45 nm part , but the process node for the I/ O hub is n't clear .
( It 's probably still some legacy process , like 130 nm or 90nm ) .
Also unclear is the type of memory controller included , though previous rumors suggested it 's a single - channel DDR2 controller .
Older rumors also have single - and dual - core variants in the works , though no mention was made of core counts in today 's disclosure .
In moving the GPU onto the same die as the CPU core , Intel arguably pushes Atom into SoC territory .
Of course , Pineview will still require a separate I/O hub chip ( a southbridge ) , but this CPU / GPU combination is new territory for Intel , and it will give us a taste of what Moorestown will be like when it launches .
( Atom and Moorestown will both be based around Intel 's Lincroft CPU core , and presumably they 'll have the same GPU core , as well . )
Pineview and NVIDIA
Pineview 's announcement raises two issues with respect to the ongoing Intel / NVIDIA brawl .
First , Pineview is a two - chip Atom solution , but so is NVIDIA 's Ion , and Ion has been out for a while .
Even worse for Intel is the fact that , from a performance perspective , Ion is just plain better .
Think about how these rival two - chip platforms stack up against one another : Pineview pairs a single Atom core with a GPU core of questionable quality , while Ion pairs two Atom cores with a really great mobile GPU ( 9400 M ) .
I can tell you which one I 'd rather have , but then again I 'm probably less concerned about battery life than the average netbook user so I lean more towards the performance option .
I 'm sure Pineview will have less power draw than Ion , making it preferable for many netbook users , but the real killer for NVIDIA is that Pineview will widen the price gap between Atom and Ion even further .
NVIDIA CEO Jen - Hsun is griping today about how Intel sells its three - chip Atom platform for $ 25 , but charges $ 45 if you unbundle it and just buy the processor alone .
When Pineview comes out , Intel will still probably charge $ 45 for a standalone Atom , while dropping the price of the two - chip platform even further .
This will place NVIDIA at a severe price disadvantage , and will seriously hamper the company 's ability to gain traction with Ion in the netbook market , which is mainly cost - sensitive and not performance - sensitive .
Of course , that still leaves the HTPC market for NVIDIA to dominate with Ion , but that market is significantly smaller than the netbook market .
The second problem with Pineview from NVIDIA 's perspective is that once the GPU moves onto the ( Intel - owned ) CPU die , it 's totally shielded from real competition .
In this respect , an on - die GPU is sort of the ultimate in Intel vendor lock - in .
But I do wonder if Intel 's TSMC deal does n't complicate this picture .
Intel 's stated goal in porting Atom to TSMC is to let SoC customers combine their third - party IP with Atom to produce custom SoCs .
What will Intel do if NVIDIA , a TSMC customer , decides that it wants to have a go at Moorestown by trying to combine an Atom core with its own graphics and I /O hardware ?
At the time of the TSMC announcement , Intel stressed that it would retain " full control " over who gets to use Atom , and that customers would deal with Intel on building and buying any outsourced Atom variants —
TSMC is just the fab in this arrangement , and has no customer - facing role .
So someone ( NVIDIA , or a third party who wants an NVIDIA / Atom combo ) would have to approach Intel about such a part , and I 'm sure Intel would have none of it .
But in light of the chipmaker 's recent antitrust troubles , can they afford to openly punish rivals like that ?
I do n't know the answer to this question , but I suspect that we may eventually find out .
Apple today rejected an update to the popular NIN iPhone application today due to objectionable content .
Earlier today , Trent Reznor tweeted the following :
Apple rejects the NIN iPhone update because it contains objectionable content .
The objectionable content referenced is “ The Downward Spiral ” .
This , of course , is n’t the first time Apple has donned its “ objectionable content ” police cap .
A few weeks ago , an update to the popular iPhone app Tweetie was rejected because a trending topic at the time was the phrase “ Fuckitlist . ”
After realizing the absurdity of the rejection , the update was approved a few hours later , and we can only assume , or hope , that the same will happen for the NIN app as well .
If you ’re interested in how the phrase “ fuckitlist ” got onto the trending topics list in the first place , it all started with an innocent tweet from comedian Michael Ian Black .
You can check out the full scoop on that story over here .
Marilyn sez , " NASA astronaut Don Pettit was tired of drinking from straws all the time in space , ' You feel like an insect sucking juices out of another insect , ' so on a mission last November he fashioned a drinking cup that would work in zero gravity via capillary action .
He used a sheet of plastic and some tape .
You can see a photo of it on this National Geographic blog along with the mathematical calculations that explain how it works . "
Don Pettit did a great interview on NPR's Science Friday about this and his other space - inventions .

This will be my last column for the L.A. Times .
After four years , I ’ll soon be starting a stint at the Pentagon as an advisor to the undersecretary of Defense for policy .
Some might say I have a “ new job , ” but because I ’ll be escaping a dying industry -- and your tax dollars will shortly be paying my salary -- I prefer to think of it as my personal government bailout .
Like everyone else whose livelihood is linked to the newspaper industry , I ’ve been watching , appalled , as newspapers continue their death spiral , with dwindling circulations and thousands of layoffs .
Here at The Times , the editorial staff is down to almost half the size it was in 2000 .
Often , as I ’ve watched talented colleagues get the ax , I ’ve suspected that I ’ve only lasted this long because as a freelancer -- with no benefits and minimal pay -- I ’m just too cheap to be worth firing .
Still , I knew it was time to pray for a government bailout in December , when my editor explained that because the paper ’s parent company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , I might not get paid for my recent columns .
From a legal perspective , he told me , I was n’t a columnist -- I was an “ unsecured creditor ” of Tribune Co . ( Along with other freelancers , I got paid in the end , but if I ever do this again , I ’ll be sure to ask CEO Sam Zell for some collateral first -- the title to his house , maybe . )

Of course , I ’m not taking a government job only because I feel lucky to parachute out before some cost - cutter eliminates every last column .
At this moment in history , I ca n’t imagine anything more rewarding than being part of the new team that ’s shaping U.S. policy .
But as I say goodbye to my wonderful Times colleagues , I also ca n’t imagine anything more dangerous than a society in which the news industry has more or less collapsed .
If newspapers become mostly infotainment websites -- if the number of well - trained investigative journalists dwindles still further -- and if we ’re soon left with nothing but the yapping heads who dominate cable “ news ” and talk radio , how will we recognize , or hope to forestall , impending national and global crises ?
How will we know if government officials have made terrible mistakes , as even the best will sometimes do ?
How will we know if government officials have told us terrible lies , as the worst have sometimes done ?
A decimated , demoralized and under - resourced press corps hardly questioned the Bush administration ’s flimsy case for war in Iraq -- and the price for that failure will be paid for generations .
It ’s time for a government bailout of journalism .

If we ’re willing to use taxpayer money to build roads , pay teachers and maintain a military ; if we ’re willing to bail out banks and insurance companies and failing automakers , we should be willing to part with some public funds to keep journalism alive too .
In an article in the April 6 Nation , John Nichols and Robert McChesney offer some ideas on how to bail out the news industry .
They suggest , for instance , eliminating postal rates for periodicals that get less than 20 % of their revenues from advertising , a tax credit for the first $ 200 taxpayers spend on newspaper subscriptions and a substantial expansion of funding for public broadcasting .
Meanwhile , Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin ( D - Md. ) has introduced legislation to allow many existing newspapers to restructure as tax - exempt nonprofit educational institutions .
And these ideas are just a start .
If the thought of government subsidization of journalism seems novel , it should n’t .
Most other democracies provide far more direct government support for public media than the U.S. does ( Canada spends 16 times as much per capita ; Britain spends 60 times as much ) .
And as Nichols and McChesney point out , our government already “ doles out tens of billions of dollars in direct and indirect [ media ] subsidies , ” including free broadcast , cable and satellite privileges .
The problem is that many of these subsidies are currently structured in ways that have actually contributed to the decline of high - quality journalism by enabling monopolies , freezing out smaller and locally controlled media outlets and encouraging large corporations to treat the news as just another product , no different from video games or sports teams .
Years of foolish policies have left us with a choice :
We can bail out journalism , using tax dollars and granting licenses in ways that encourage robust and independent reporting and commentary , or we can watch , wringing our hands , as more and more top journalists are laid off or bail out , leaving us with nothing in our newspapers but ads , entertainment features and crossword puzzles .

E3 is right around the corner , and Destructoid has been hearing all sorts of juicy rumors .
A lot of things are being said , and among them a very reliable source has informed us that Valve and Electronic Arts are looking to reveal Left 4 Dead 2 at E3 next week .
L4D 2 will see four different survivors battling the infected horde as they try to survive the game 's four scenarios .
The game is said to be set during the same time frame and locations as the first title , but the four new survivors will be fighting off the infected in other parts of the same locations .
To us , it sounds a bit like Ada sidequests from Resident Evil 4 -- while Leon was going through his mission , Ada was running around the same areas , doing her own thing .
We 're also told to expect new guns , as well as a variety of melee weapons like a baseball bat , axe , and chainsaw .
Players should also brace themselves to come face to face with at least one new special infected " boss " character ... something big .
And fast .
If what we 're hearing is solid , Left 4 Dead 2 is planned for the PC and Xbox 360 .
While the information we received was vague , the source had been reliable in the past , and the idea of a sequel to Destructoid 's 2008 " Game of the Year " was too exciting not to share .
If this pans out , we hope to see more -- at least in the form of an announcement trailer -- at E3 next week .

Advertisement Thousands of Georgians have gathered outside parliament saying they will not disperse until the president resigns .
Protesters , numbering up to 60,000 , blamed President Mikhail Saakashvili for defeat against Russia in August 's war and said he had stifled democracy .
The opposition alleged that dozens of members were arrested before the rally - a claim denied by the government .
President Saakashvili urged Georgians to show unity and " work day and night ... to finally liberate Georgia " .
He was speaking at a ceremony in the capital , Tbilisi , to commemorate the day , 20 years ago , when 20 people died as Soviet Red Army troops crushed a popular protest in the same place .
In pictures : Georgia protests " It is absolutely clear that no matter what opinions we may hold and how we may differ from each other , we have one homeland , " he said .
He linked the events of 1989 to those of last August , when Georgia fought a brief war against Russia .
" This is what these people sacrificed themselves for under Russian tank tracks , and what our fighters sacrificed themselves for last August ... freedom and a united Georgia , " he said .
The BBC's Tom Esslemont in Tbilisi says opposition leaders have deliberately chosen this poignant date for their demonstrations .
Estimates of the crowd range between 50,000 and 60,000 , news agencies reported .
Organisers had expected up to 100,000 , AFP news agency said .
The mood was calm as protesters gathered outside parliament on Thursday morning , and there was little sign of a police presence , our correspondent says .
This is the most organised protest since the war with Russia , he adds , and it is one that opposition leaders are likely to be pleased with .
1989 : Georgian uprising crushed Earlier , van-loads of riot police had been seen arriving at Tbilisi 's parliament square .
Opposition leaders have appealed to the government not to use violence to break up mass protests .
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to break up the last mass protests in Tbilisi in November 2007 .
Claims of plot " I do n't think that it should be a surprise that after we lost 20 % of Georgian territory and have no democracy in the country , we are asking for the resignation of the president , " said Nino Burjanadze .
Ms Burjanadze was formerly an ally of Mr Saakashvili but now leads the opposition Democratic Movement - United Georgia party .
The party said 60 members , who had been planning to attend the demonstrations , were arrested overnight .
An interior ministry spokesman said that was " not true " .
Our correspondent says both opposition and government figures have accused one another of planning to use violence in Thursday 's rallies .
Video footage was recently released by the government allegedly showing a group of opposition supporters planning a disturbance at the protests .
The government accused the men of trying to provoke the government into using force .

" My position does not give me the liberty to exclude anything , but my mood tells me there will not be violence , " he told Reuters .
" There is no chance of a revolution in Georgia . "

They are meant to be about the future of Europe and the delivery of vital local services such as schools and social care .
But in truth it will be the future of Gordon Brown that will be the main question hanging over the European and local elections on 4 June .
If Labour does badly , the recently revived muttering and perhaps even the plotting about the Prime Minister 's future can be expected to thicken .
The expectation that David Cameron is on course for victory in a general election next year will grow .
If , on the other hand , Labour avoids disaster Mr Brown will be safe and on the Labour benches hope will be rekindled that Mr Cameron could yet be denied .
At first glance the European elections would seem to be the more severe of the two electoral tests for Mr Brown .
The whole country will get the chance to vote in a straightforward proportional representation election .
Labour 's success or failure will be unambiguously recorded for all to see .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In contrast local elections are only taking place in shire – and thus mostly Tory – England .
Only 27 county and seven unitary councils ( including five new ones ) are at stake .
Any shortcomings in Labour 's performance would seem capable of being dismissed on the grounds that little of national significance can be read into such unrepresentative results .
In truth , Mr Brown may well have less to fear in the European elections than he does in the local contests .
This is for one simple reason .
When the country last voted in European elections in 2004 Labour performed abysmally .
It won less than 23 per cent of the nationwide vote , not least because the party was beginning to pay for the unpopularity of the Iraq war .
Yet just 12 months later Tony Blair still went on to win a historic third term .
Even the most recent opinion polls still suggest the party stands at 27 per cent in Westminster voting intentions .
Getting 23 per cent or thereabouts ought not be too difficult .
And so long as the result is not significantly worse than 2004 , Labour 's spin machine will be able to argue it can recover in 2010 just as it did in 2005 .
Mind you , European elections have the habit of throwing up the unexpected .
In 1989 the Greens famously won as much as 15 per cent of the vote , largely at the expense of the Liberal Democrats .
Five years ago , Ukip that took the country by storm , securing as much as 16 per cent of the vote , with the Conservatives ( and again the Liberal Democrats ) losing out .
Labour 's fear is that this time it will be the BNP that makes a sudden breakthrough and Labour will take the hit .
Nick Griffin 's party does best in working - class areas with high ethnic - minority populations in the North of England and the Midlands – in other words in traditional Labour territory .
But if past precedent is kind to Mr Brown in the European elections , it could be a serious source of embarrassment to him in the local elections .
For this particular round of elections was last contested on general election day 2005 .
True , people did not vote in those local elections in exactly the same way they did in the general election – the Liberal Democrats fared better and Labour and the Conservatives rather worse .
But even so , the results will provide a direct measure of how much Labour has fallen from favour since its last election victory .
Moreover , the few scraps of power Labour does have in shire England are all vulnerable .
The party is defending just four councils : Derbyshire , Lancashire , Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire .
All four will be lost if the swing against Labour reflects that currently registered by the opinion polls .
And never before has a party suffered a complete wipe - out on local election day .
Those with long memories will recall the last and only time that Labour suffered defeat in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire .
It was in 1977 during the darkest days of the last Labour government under Jim Callaghan , a government whose demise heralded 18 years of Tory rule .
So perhaps Labour MPs would regard losing those two counties again as the clearest sign of all that Mr Brown is leading them to serious defeat .

There are a few events in every lifetime that will be remembered forever .
In some cases these events are the celebration of an achievement , of a reward earned .
Such was that early Spring morning in 2009 that I pulled past the bold blue and white military - like sign that read Milford Proving Grounds .
For this was the day I test drove the Chevy Volt mule .
From that in many ways distant day in January 2007 , when I first saw a news report about the Chevy Volt and was so inspired to register the domain GM - Volt.com to this day some 26 months and 900 articles later I and many of you my most revered readers and copilots have essentially been waiting for this landmark moment .
Inside the proving grounds I met my guide and co-pilot Greg Ceisel .
Greg is the Chevy Volt program manager and had been involved since its early days .
After a brief tour of the Proving Grounds and and overview of it 130 or so miles of top secret test track , he took me into a building about the size of an airplane hanger .
We walked into the electric vehicles section and there before me were a half a dozen Volt mules with varying appearance and states of disrepair and several plug - in Saturn Vues .
My Volt was silver blue and adorned with special white Volt graphics .
This vehicle was the same one former CEO Rick Wagoner had famously driven through the streets of DC to testify before Congress , and the same one that members of the President 's Task Force on Autos had driven .
Politics in these dire times for GM had to come before their fans .
This vehicle is in the second generation of test cars , having been built after the first batch which were cruder " Malivolts . "
About 30 - odd of these cars were in existence .
They contained nearly finalized Volt powertrains including 16 kwh lithium - ion battery packs , 111 peak kw electric motors and 53 kw engine generators .
This was not a Chevy Volt in interior or exterior design , but rather they were European - version Chevy Cruze compact sedans .
The Cruze uses the same compact delta platform as the Volt and shares similar interior dimensions .
Aerodynamically the Cruze has a higher coefficient of drag so true 40 mile AERs are not achieved but " come very close " per Mr. Ceisel .
After a brief tour , it was my turn to drive .
The car is started by a push button that lights green , no key is needed , and the turn - on process is utterly silent .
The interior was sufficiently roomy and comfortable , and nicely ergonomically designed .
It was lacking the elegant high - tech and sophisticated double LCD display the production Volt has , and all the sure to be wonderful bells and whistles the production Volt will have .
There was no engine / battery feedback for the driver .
Technicians normally would connect a laptop to the mule to monitor , manage , and tweak the cars behavior .
This interface had been removed for my drive .
My only feedback was Km/h on the speedometer and number of miles driven .
The mule was like the Volt , functionally a four - seater , the T - shaped battery pack running down the middle was low enough that the rear seat bench had no bulge , but legroom in the center of the bench was replaced by the battery .
Once started there was only a very slightly scarcely audible and occasional whir within the engine compartment but was overall strikingly and serenely silent .
And then with one small step for man and one large step for mankind and with the collective goodwill of the thousands of you GM - Volt readers on this journey with me , I depressed the accelerator .
Instant silent and sustained torque ensued .
The car had considerable brisk acceleration and power .
It was smooth as silk and utterly quiet .
It was truly a marvelous thing of beauty .
I sailed up hills and muscled around the curves of the sterile and peculiarly industrial landscape of the proving grounds .
The car handled marvelously .
Greg told me that this car was n't near final refinement yet and that the production Volt would handle even better .
Hard to believe .
The braking had a customary feel .
Regenerative braking was of course in effect , and every downhill grade and coast charged the pack .
GM had cleverly built in two driving configuration options called D and L. Both gave the same acceleration , but when you step off the accelerator you get strong regenerative drag if in L and coast in D , the former being best for city driving .
As Greg said this could allow you to drive with one foot .
There was of course no transmission so whether driving 5 or 75 mph the same gear was maintained .
This was pleasant and comfortable and provided appropriate dynamic power at all velocities , there was no perceived " need " to shift .
I found the car to be light , nimble , agile and very fun to drive .
Acceleration was terrific and spirited .
I had the chance to take the car straight up a very treacherous - appearing pure 16 - 1/ 2 % grade .
It was a hill that I cannot recall seeing a similar version of in real life .
The car had no trouble making it to the top , and with it floored could hit about 50 mph .
I drove the car a total of 15 miles through the test tracks .
At this point in time I was n't permitted to experience the shift to generator mode .
Greg said it was seamless and most drivers did n't notice it , but GM was still shy about showing it off until some further tweaking had occurred .
I was promised a chance to come back when the time was right for it .
The bottom line is that the car was a solid , pleasant , agile and sporty compact sedan .
It handled and behaved like any car in its category should .
It was as its own chief engineer Andrew Farah says , " unremarkable .
" I would expand that to remarkably unremarkable .
Unremarkable in that the average driver would experience driving it as they would any other small sporty sedan .
It was not a toy a or some tinny weak neighborhood car .
What was remarkable and indeed profoundly so is that it does so without the use of gasoline .
It is a car that has absolutely no -compromises .
Yet , it is electric .
That is a feat of monumental importance .
This is a car that the masses will embrace because of the kind of car it is .
That is uses no gas for 40 miles is the real breakthrough .
And so it was that I drove the Volt mule on that Spring day .
A regular guy who just started a blog to influence the direction of US transportation and who now found himself at the very wheel of that futureGM has done what they set out to over two years ago and amazingly well I might add , despite all the trials and tribulations that have transpired .
The real Volt will be here in a few short weeks .
We 'll be waiting . [ flash http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03-4zuUEPaM]

It is unclear how many North Koreans will be able to try the pizzas North Korea 's first pizzeria has opened in the capital Pyongyang , according to a Japan - based newspaper .
Chefs were sent to Italy for training by leader Kim Jong - il , who said North Koreans should be able to try the world 's best foods , said Choson Sinbo .
Many people in the secretive communist state live in poverty and rely on food aid , but a wealthy elite can afford a more luxurious lifestyle .
An estimated two million North Koreans have died in famines since the 1990s .
Mr Kim 's expensive tastes in food have often been commented on by those who have met him .
He is believed to have a fondness for caviar , French wines , shark fin soup and cognac .
But the new restaurant 's manager , Kim Sang- soon , said Mr Kim believed all North Koreans should " also be allowed access to the world 's famous dishes " .
I knew well from television and publications that pizza and spaghetti are world famous food , but it is the first time that I 've tasted it
Jong Un-suk , customer
Making pizza for Kim Jong - il
" He then called for the establishment of a restaurant specialising in Italian food , " Kim Sang - soon told the Choson Sinbo .
The pro-North Korean newspaper said the restaurant , which imports its flour , butter and cheese from Italy , had been busy since opening in December .
Many customers were trying Italian food for the first time .
" I knew well from television and publications that pizza and spaghetti are world famous food , but it is the first time that I 've tasted it , " said one diner , Jong Un-suk .
Pyongyang already has a successful fried chicken outlet , opened in 2007 and , its owners say , taking £ 1,000 a day .
Food aid Last year , chefs were flown to Naples and Rome to learn how to create authentic pizzas and pasta dishes , returning to North Korea to perfect them through " trial and error " , said Kim Sang - soon .

But it is possible the new restaurant has been at least a decade in the planning .
Italian chef Ermanno Furlanis was flown to North Korea in 1997 along with special pizza ovens .
In 2004 , he described to the BBC how he had given lessons to three army officers who took copious notes and asked detailed questions such as how far apart olives should be placed on each pizza .
Mr Furlanis said Kim Jong - il may even have visited one of the training sessions , being held on a ship anchored offshore .
" I am not in the position to say whether it really was him , but our chef , who had no reason to fib , was , for the space of several minutes , utterly speechless , " Mr Furlanis said .
" He said he felt as if he had seen God , and I still envy him this experience . "
It is , however , unlikely that many ordinary people will be able to eat in the new restaurant .
North Korea is among the world 's poorest countries , relying on international food aid to feed its people .
According to the World Food Programme , up to nine million North Koreans were facing urgent food shortages this winter .

Under the headline " We boobed " , the ad says the company had decided to charge more on the basis that larger bras cost more to make , but now admits that they " were wrong " .
The climbdown came after a group calling itself " Busts 4 Justice " raised a nationwide outcry about the extra charge .
Group members had bought M&S shares and had planned to tackle the company 's chief executive , Stuart Rose , on the issue at the company 's annual meeting .
M&S will now reduce the price of its larger bras ( size DD and above ) by £ 2 , and , from Saturday , will offer 25 per cent off all bras for a two - week period .

Despite the might of your own country , despite the power of your own military , for extended periods of time you and other soldiers simply can’t get enough drinking water .
And even worse , some of you are paying for it with your health .
That ’s the story some U.S. soldiers are telling the 11 News Defenders about their time in Iraq .
While we ’ve spent billions on bullets and bombs , soldiers in different parts of that arid country , during different phases of this desert war , claim they could n’t get enough drinkable water .
[ snip ]
Part of the problem :
Many soldiers say they were rationed to just two 1.5 liter bottles a day or about half a gallon of water .
Turns out , the Army ’s own training manuals say in desert environments , the body can lose up to four gallons a day .
As a result , some soldiers claim they regularly saw dehydration causing sickness on the battlefield , things like fainting and vomiting .
Obama , we know that the Bush Administration neglected the troops , we know that , now please clean this up .

In a straighter realm , a Bay Area wanderer is lost for good 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
It was both a failure and an accomplishment that I kept Randy Robinson 's orchid alive for over a year .
I 'm not otherwise the type -- I barely manage to buy milk -- but a small voice said that flowers given to you by people like Randy are worth the effort ; maybe they 're as rare and fragile as the people who gave them to you .
Anyway , the orchid's a withered bit of straw on my back porch now .
Only thing left to do is talk about Randy himself .
I 'd needed someone to sublet my dark , stained , depressing little office in the Mission .
It was part of a warehouse that had been carved up into individual workstations , rented out to self - employed types .
Serious young people working seriously at tidy desks .
I 'd been offered a preferable office , and I needed someone to finish my last three months .
The man who answered the ad was about 110 years old , and arrived two hours late on a child 's wooden scooter .
He wore a tattered old raincoat and carried a suspiciously full duffel bag .
His bald head gleamed .
His eyebrows were dyed blue , and his beard was blue , and his teeth were wild .
He rolled the scooter into the warehouse .
" Did you know I 'm thinking of raising a Malaysian raven , capable of distinguishing a man in a hat from a man without a hat ? " he asked , then transitioned to Niels Bohr .
Bohr had sassed back to Einstein .
Then he was talking about a shoeshine boy on 22nd Street , and how things might be different in a Chinese watercolor ...
Randy 's monologue lasted 20 minutes .
It was the kind that 's just lucid enough you try to follow it .
" Those watercolors , well , you know how sometimes you throw a so - called road apple up at a tree ?
A crabapple tree ? "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" Um , yeah ? "
" Well , you throw one and then you throw another , but nothing happens .
But why would it ?
And that 's my point , with the men up there on mountaintops , but I 'm not on a mountaintop , I 'm down here in the shifting sands ... "
I finally led him up to my dark , stained , depressing office .
His jaw dropped -- it really did , just like Howdy Doody .
He loved it .
Randy gave off the unmistakable vibe of near - homelessness .
He was also sweet - natured and plainly intelligent , even if his thoughts did n't always connect clearly .
He said he was a writer , too , and would be writing up a business scheme for a " Green Grand Prix " -- an extravagant race for alternative fuel vehicles that he was planning for the Presidio .
Unbeknownst the Presidio .
I knew he was going to be living on that couch .
But so what ?
Accepting the premise that it's bad to have people sleep in your office -- and overlooking the fact that this was often a badge of honor for the hard - charging Silicon Valley set -- is n't it less bad than contributing to someone 's homelessness ?
If I declined to rent him the office , it was clear he'd soon be on the street .
Eccentricity is not a crime , I reminded myself .
On the contrary , it 's in short supply in our decreasingly bohemian city .
Randy handed me two months ' rent and a perfect white orchid , and I gave him the key .
The phone calls came immediately .
The other workers in the warehouse did n't like Randy 's style .
Where did I find him , again ?
Was he crazy ?
He talked so much , even when their headphones were on .
Might he steal from them ?
And then there were his strange habits .
What was with the exotic fish in mayonnaise jars , or the orchids he left all around the common area ?
The common area !
I became a reassurer .
Randy was kooky , but he was n't going to do anything bad .
By this point I 'd logged a few days with him , meeting for coffee , helping him move in and get situated , getting him familiar with the neighborhood .
He was n't anywhere near 110 , it turned out , but he'd lived a long and varied life -- mostly of extravagant and aborted dreams .
After working on a pipeline in Alaska , he 'd spent the next year devising an indoor , simulated beach resort there in the snow .
He 'd had it planned down to the table settings .
Then there was his salmon project .
The idea was to get a hold of several dozen young ones and raise them in gold - colored tanks .
When he released them up along the West Coast , they were going to instinctively lead him to actual gold .
Then there were the Thailand years .
He went there to get all his organs replaced with younger ones .
Then he decided Thailand needed a hot dog hut .
That idea grew , as such things do , into an aquarium .
He was going to build the world 's first million - gallon aquarium .
None of these schemes ever materialized .
But Randy was not fazed .
On the contrary , he was the happiest man I 'd ever met .
He had new ideas every day , and whenever I came around -- which seemed to be happening a lot -- he'd pat my arm and laugh with his crazy teeth and offer me a spot on the Green Grand Prix board of directors , which did n't technically exist .
I had my doubts about Randy -- it was rough getting trapped in one of his endless monologues .
But hearing these fussy young office workers complain about him convinced me that I had to defend him .
The complaints kept coming , week after week -- Randy was spilling water everywhere , Randy 's stuff was migrating into the hallway , Randy was overly candid on the subject his swollen testicles .
He mentioned casually that nobody there would even talk to him .
I took up his freak flag , waved it righteously : " Had n't we all moved to San Francisco precisely because of its tolerance for outsiders ?
What becomes of these eccentrics if they 're pushed further and further to the margins ? "
It seemed a perfect encapsulation of all that was happening throughout San Francisco , and perhaps the country : the final relics of a more open , curious era butting up an increasingly impatient and straight - laced culture , ostensibly tolerant political views notwithstanding .
Rising rents , obsessive productivity , a broken healthcare system and a subtle but inveterate uptightness conspired to make benign wanderers like Randy even fringier than they might have been .
" Anyway , " I 'd continue in fine , sermonizing lather , " was he really all that strange , or did he just look strange ? "
That last one was my trump card -- if they answered wrong , they 'd appear shallow and small .
Of course the truth is that Randy was strange as hell .
By March it was getting harder to prop him up .
Someone was forgetting to turn the office alarm on at night , guess who they suspected ?
I visited Randy to strategize .
By now the office was a hovel , with open jars of jelly and assorted medications strewn over the carpeting .
The fish fluttered dejectedly in their mayonnaise jars .
I pretended not to notice a mouse dart under my couch .
Randy did n't want to strategize .
On the precipice of eviction , he wanted to show me the beautiful tie he'd found at a dollar store .
At one point it slipped out of his hands .
He bent down to retrieve it , and instead came up with a wool hat .
He was more discombobulated than usual , but before I left he took me by the elbow and spoke with a solemnity I 'd never heard from him .
" You 've always shown me great friendship , " he said , and then I stepped out the door .
The final call came a few days later .
One of the young people at the warehouse had discovered Randy lying on the floor , shirtless and moaning .
The office mate had been annoyed to have to wait while Randy found a ride to the doctor .
" What ?
Moaning ?
Is he okay ? " I asked .
" We 're voting him off the island , " the office manager informed me tartly .
I e-mailed Randy and left a message on his voicemail .
I 'd failed .
I could 've fought more , gotten more involved with his life -- not just the occasional visit , but real friendship .
Maybe if I 'd cleaned his office for him , it would 've jump - started a bigger change .
I suspected Randy was having some version of these thoughts too , because a week passed with no reply .
It was on a Sunday night in January of last year that I got the e-mail from Randy 's brother .
Not mentioned in any of Randy 's monologues were his hepatitis , or his HIV - positive status or the growing infection in his leg .
Randy died alone at the hospital a week earlier , and nobody had known who he was .
He was 62 .
The only thing in his pockets had been my contact information .
* * *
If you 've ever learned that you were the sole lifeline to a strange , gentle man , who died alone at a hospital with nobody to hold his hand , you know what those first two weeks were like .
In the spirit of Randy 's emphatic ebullience , I 'll spare you the gloominess .
I 'd like to say the weeks after his death were an uninterrupted plane of sadness , but that would be a lie .
Because when the day came to tell the others at the warehouse , and I peddled over one last time , the embarrassing truth is that I found myself bizarrely giddy .
I was going to make those people feel so damn guilty .
Yes , they would learn the mother of all lessons .
Rather than accept Randy , they 'd complained and rejected him , and now look .
It was like some after - school special I could n't quite put my finger on , but I knew there was a moral in there somewhere , and it was going to weigh tremendously on their complaining little shoulders .
But of course you can't change people 's minds -- that only really happens in movies .
In reality , you bike over to the warehouse , loaded up with your torpedo of truth , but nobody faints in horror , or weeps in regret , or drops out of society to re-calibrate their ethical compass .
The folks at the warehouse did what anyone would 've done .
They said " wow , " and they looked off in the distance for a few moments , and then eventually they got back to work .
I work now in a nice communal office a few miles away , and it 's not dark or stained or depressing .
If I were to dye my beard blue and start a fish collection , I suspect I 'd be indulged .
But realistically I wo n't .
Without a Randy Robinson around , I list toward normal -- I work too much , I take the bus home , I forget to water the orchid .
It takes more than one Randy in your life to snap you out of those habits .
Still , I like to think I 'm capable of more .
One day , at least in theory , I could push the work aside .
I could connect with that stranger , perhaps more joyful way of relating to the universe , and commence raising a Malaysian raven , capable of distinguishing a man in a hat from a man without a hat .

no deaths
The emergence of a viral strain that is capable of evading the host 's immune system as well as transmits and replicates effectively , is precisely the recipe for a potential pandemic .
If you have n't heard of swine flu - Influenza A H1N1 - by now ... well , you have unless you can't read , which means you are n't on this website .
Reading too many popular media articles may have led you to believe there 's an epidemic on your doorstep .
Fortunately , it 's just an epidemic of hysteria .
The number of reported swine flu cases ( edit - okay , one death , still not worth a panic ) in the US is 1/1000th of the regular flu deaths that occur each year .
Although a H1N1 vaccine is a few months off and would undoubtedly cure your hysteria , perhaps in the mean time learning more about thine swine flu enemy will lessen your inner fears of the microbial unknown .
Aside from wondering if you ’re going to die soon , I ’m almost positive the second and third questions on your mind are ; what are the molecular mechanisms that make Influenza A so nasty ?
And then maybe , how the heck did Wilbur the pig , a distantly related creature , manage to spread his cooties to humans ?
Influenza A infects approximately 10 % of the population in the US each year and causes approximately 35,000 deaths annually .
That 's arguably a good year considering Influenza A also makes a recurring appearance every 10 to 15 years as a highly virulent form that is responsible for epidemics .
So what is it about Influenza A that makes it a top candidate for pandemics ?
The primary answer lies in its genomic layout .
Influenza
A is a RNA virus and in general , RNA viruses have a very high rate of mutation , a short generation time and yield a high production of virions after replication in the host ’s cells .
However , influenza
A ’s most advantageous feature is its segmented genome which consists of eight different linear RNA strands .
These strands can combine with each other and create novel genotypes — an important mechanism for extremely rapid adaptation to new hosts .
The major advantage conferred by a segmented genome comes into play during coinfection which is when a cell becomes infected by two different viral strains at the same time .
During coinfection , different segments of each virion can recombine , thus creating a new viral strain emergence that is sometimes even more detrimental than the original parent viral strains .
Furthermore , viral strains from different species can also recombine with each other .
When two different species ’ influenza strains ( for example pig and human ) recombine , the novel viral strain that emerges potentially has a better chance of evading the immune system and persisting in the host organism than the pre-existing viral strains .
In other words , the host organism ’s immune system does n’t have antibodies for viruses indigenous to other species and thanks to the original virus that is indigenous to the host , molecular features necessary for “ optimal ” host infection are retained .
Every 10 to 15 years , influenza undergoes a dramatic genetic change ( antigenic shift ) which as described , is responsible for epidemics / pandemics .
In between epidemics , minor influenza genetic changes occur ( antigenic drift ) .
These minor changes are relatively predictable and clinicians are able to develop effective flu vaccines every year .
However , highly virulent duel - specie strains are a challenge to quarantine .
Due to the sudden and drastic antigenic shifts that are observed in rare / novel hybrid viral strains , making vaccine predictions are no longer possible and pre-designed flu shots are ineffective .
Credit : National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) Another reason as to why researchers are unable to predict epidemics is that they are unclear as to what key mechanisms are required for viral emergence .
The truth is that there really are n’t a lot of observable trends to base predictions off of and there is n't a way to determine how susceptible a potential host is for a given virus .
Evolution , for example , seems as if it would be one of the mechanisms required for cross-species transmission .
In order to successfully infect a new host , the virus must be able to effectively replicate in the host ’s cells .
Such a task is met with multiple barriers including host cell entry via receptor binding which requires genetic compatibility .
Overcoming all of these hurdles means there must be a corresponding change in the virion 's genetic makeup .
Avian influenza viruses replicate in the gastrointestinal tract while human influenza viruses replicate in the respiratory tract — as conveyed by their differential genetic makeup .
What researchers do n’t know is if viruses that jump the species barrier are already compatible with the new host or if they evolve compatibility after the fact .
Needless to say , evolutionary adaptation to new hosts is a poorly understood process .
Although we know that hybrid influenza viruses are a serious risk , evolutionary changes are not always required for viral emergence in a new host .
In the case of the 1918 human influenza epidemic , it is believed that the virus contained eight avian RNA strands .
It was also just determined that Influenza A H1N1 is a combination of two pig Influenza viruses .
Therefore , cross-species transmissions do not always require antigenic shifts in order to adapt to their new host .
Intuition seemingly breaks down when studying cross-species transmission .
It ’s logical to assume that the more closely related to a species we are , the more likely it is we will contract viruses from them .
Indeed the majority of viruses that humans contract are mammalian in origin , but we have also contracted viruses from birds .
HIV is an example of a virus contracted from a closely related species , however , even though we ’re most closely related to chimpanzees , our exposure to them is limited .
On a global scale , humans are more exposed to rodents which are responsible for a large number of emerged viruses in humans .
Another factor to take into consideration is that more closely related species share the same / similar alleles and other innate immune antibodies , meaning some organisms have pre-immunity to closely related organism viruses .
This is in contrast to more distantly related species where less immune system components are similar .
Overall , phylogenetic relationships may not be a crucial factor in cross-species transmission but rather , the occurrence of residing in close proximity to other animals .
Also , domesticated animals sometimes act as transitionary viral carriers .
SARS emergence for example , originated in bats , but humans contracted the virus from civet cats .
Not knowing factors that determine whether or not a virus will result in a pandemic is a major problem in public health .
We realize that it is a very real possibility for a new and rapidly spreading virus to potentially reach numbers to where quarantine is no longer a viable strategy — hence the root cause of mass hysteria .
Clearly we must take advised precautions in such times , but epidemics are and have always been inherently part of the human condition and is sometimes out of our control , which if anything , accepting reality can have a calming effect .

Thierry Henry has emerged as a major doubt for Barcelona 's Champions League semi-final second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday , after sustaining an injury at the weekend .
Henry received a blow to his knee during his side 's 6 – 2 humbling of Real Madrid on Saturday and reports in Spain claim the striker will be out for between eight and 10 days .
However , the club have said that the 31 - year - old will travel with the squad to London and they will monitor the player 's progress as he attempts to make a dramatic recovery in time for the crucial last - four encounter at Stamford Bridge .
Should Henry miss out , his absence will come as a blow to the Spanish side , for whom the Frenchman has been in superb form over recent weeks , scoring twice at the Bernabéu on Saturday night .
Barcelona are already without the injured Rafael Márquez ( knee ) and the suspended Carles Puyol for Wednesday night 's tie .
New Danger Mouse CD Released As A Blank CD - R Due To Legal Fight With EMI
from the now - that 's - creative dept
Danger Mouse 's new project Dark Night Of The Soul consists of an album length piece of music by Danger Mouse , Sparklehorse and a host of guest vocalists , along with a collection of original David Lynch photography inspired by and based on the music .
The photographs , which provide a visual narrative for the music , are compiled in a limited edition , hand numbered 100 + page book which will now come with a blank , recordable CD -R .
All copies will be clearly labeled : ' For Legal Reasons , enclosed CD - R contains no music .
Use it as you will .'
Due to an ongoing dispute with EMI , Danger Mouse is unable to release the recorded music for Dark Night Of The Soul without fear of being sued by EMI .
Danger Mouse remains hugely proud of Dark Night Of The Soul and hopes that people lucky enough to hear the music , by whatever means , are as excited by it as he is .

If you follow copyright issues , you 're no doubt aware of Danger Mouse .
He 's the DJ who got quite a lot of attention a few years back for creating one of the very firstmashups -- mixing the Beatle ' swith Jay - Z'sto create the rather unique .
Of course , one of the main reasons why the album became so well known was because EMI sent cease - and - desist letters to everyone who posted copies of the album , and then to anyone who posted that they were going to participate in the " Grey Tuesday " protest .
The whole thing seemed pretty silly .
It 's not as if anyone listening towould find it a substitute for either of the other albums .
Since then , of course , DJ Danger Mouse has gone on to even more mainstream success with hisproject , a collaboration between Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo Green .
However , it looks like DJ Danger Mouse has another album that he 's been working on , in association with Mark Linkous ( of Sparklehorse ) .
Yet , due to ongoing legal troubles with EMI , he can't actually release the music .
So he 's come up with a rather creative solution .
Found via Andrew Dubber , the news is that the next album will be released as album artwork with a blank recordable CD Yes , aCD - R. There is no music on it .
Because if there were music on it , it would get him in more trouble with EMI .
Yet , if you have that blank CD and all the artwork , you certainly could ( not that they 're suggesting you do ... ) find that music elsewhere and burn it to the CD .
The statement from Danger Mouse reads :
In some ways , this is reminiscent of what the band Green Day did many years ago , offering up blank CDs with artwork for fans who had downloaded the music from unauthorized sources .
Yet , in this case , it 's even more interesting since there areauthorized sources at all for the music .
It 'll be fun to see how EMI reacts . :
Meanwhile , the folks at NPR alert us to the fact that they 're hosting a streaming version of the album for anyone who wants to hear it .

December 2007 , at the Introversion Christmas dinner , Mark Morris gave a speech to the team in which he stated that the year just gone had been a totally crap year , because we did n’t do anything .
We did n’t launch any existing projects or start any new projects – it was a year of on - going work , with little to break up the limbo .
To much applause and laughter , we agreed 2008 would be the year we corrected that problem , and all the hard work we ’d done in 2007 would pay off in 2008 .
We had multiple projects in development and opportunities opening up all around us , we would finish and release everything we were working on , and we ’d grow Introversion along the way and take on even more great projects .
After a tough year , the future was bright .
A year later at the end of 2008 at the Introversion Christmas dinner , and Mr Morris again silenced the room and gave his annual speech : “ See last year ’s speech ” .
This time nobody laughed , and there was no applause .
By all accounts , 2008 was a disastrous year for Introversion , characterised by an incredibly positive start and a noticeable increase in ambition , but not a single genuine success throughout the whole year .
There was only one bit of good news – that we survived the whole year without laying anybody off or closing the company .
This blog is a summary of 2008 – in three increasingly depressing parts .
At the start of the year we had a whole raft of projects to keep us busy .
We had our Xbox 360 project Darwinia + , which was Darwinia and Multiwinia combined .
The Multiwinia component was still in active development , and we were hard at work getting the whole package running well on the Xbox dev kits .
We planned a simultaneous launch of Darwinia + on Xbox , and Multiwinia on PC , Mac and Steam , all on the same day – our fourth major game launch , and our biggest yet .
While that project was ongoing , myself and Mark had been pursuing a fascinating opportunity to develop a big budget Introversion game for Channel 4 , based on a long standing Introversion idea called Chronometer .
After numerous meetings with lovely people at the TV company ’s London headquarters , they ’d agreed to fund a pre-production concept phase , which would last three months and would involve us hiring a fulltime professional writer and a team of concept artists .
This was a serious project whose final budget would be over £ 1,000,000 if we got what we wanted , by far our most ambitious game design yet .
( Chronometer concept art )
On top of all of that , our long standing friends at Pinnacle Software ( responsible for our boxed shop distribution in the UK ) were looking to get into publishing , and we ’d signed a deal to license Defcon for the Nintendo DS , to be developed by a third party and overseen by us .
And of course , in between all of this , the project that really excited me , there was Subversion .
I worked on this whenever I could .
At the start of the year I was in full swing , working fast on major systems for the game , blogging regularly , enjoying the process of working on a brand new game , and a brand new code base .
Being brutally honest , while I agreed 100 % with the business strategy of taking on the other projects , my real interest was with Subversion , and everything else was a means to that end .
The first major problem was Microsoft .
I want to be clear that in hindsight , we believe Microsoft were absolutely correct in the calls they made , and we were wrong .
But at the time , oh my god they were pissing us off .
We ’d done a massive treatment of the in - game menus for Darwinia and Multiwinia , and the end result is exactly what you see in the PC / Mac versions of Multiwinia now .
We were very happy with that and considered the game ready to go through their certification process , but Microsoft did not agree .
They requested we go into an extensive period of redesign and polish on the game , covering everything from the menus to the squaddie control method in Darwinia , to the game modes in Multiwinia .
It was the first time a massive company had effectively told Introversion what to do , and we did n’t like that at all .
It was also months of work , and the concept of open - ended polish and iteration with a company several orders of magnitude larger than our own did n’t hugely appeal .
We finally resolved this situation in the only way we could – we separated the PC and Xbox versions of the game , pushed ahead with a PC only version of Multiwinia , and put the Xbox project on a back burner .
It 's pretty obvious in Hindsight that Microsoft had the right idea all along for Darwinia + , and we were too absorbed with Multiwinia to see that .
We wanted the focus to be the new game Multiwinia , they wanted the IGF winning game Darwinia .

Weekend Highlight : Land of the Lost Economy
Things were a bit more hectic than usual here at our Baltimore HQ , this week .
It was the week before Memorial Day and office workers seemed to go missing with odd frequency – knowing that they would n’t be seen again until the following Tuesday .
But here at The Daily Reckoning we never really stop working … especially in times like these .
Things need to be reckoned with daily , even during long holiday weekends .
And so we ’ve put together Weekend Edition of the DR for your consideration .
Bill Bonner was reckoning with Congress on Capitol Hill this week and shares that experience with us in the excerpt below …
Yesterday …we ventured into “ Bubble World . ”
“ What ’s going on ?
When will this be over ?
How bad do you think it will get ?
What can we do to turn this around ? ”
Members of Congress have the same questions the rest of us have .
They read the same claptrap in the newspapers .
They hear the same balderdash explanations from economists and federal officials .
They ’re wondering what is really going on .
Not that we know .
But they asked us anyway .
We report to you today from the banks of the Potomac .
Our old friend , Congressman Ron Paul organized an off - the - record discussion with several other members of Congress .
The subject was the financial meltdown … and the bailout .
We were there to talk , of course , but we were more interested in listening .
“ You do n’t understand , ” said a Senate functionary we met later , “ these people live in Bubble World .
They ’re protected from the real world by their staffs and by the system itself .
You imagine that they would know what is going on .
But they do n’t .
They know less than we do .
And they ’ll be the last to find out .
They are so busy meeting constituents … dealing with donors … working out deals with their political parties and supporters … and feeling like big shots … they do n’t really have any time to study the issues .
So they count on staff and party committees to tell them what to say , how to vote … and what to think . ”
Waiting in the corridor of the Cannon building , two men in grey suits walked by …we overheard this conversation :
“ Did you vote ‘ no ’ on that last resolution ?
You we ’re supposed to vote ‘ yes . ’ ”
“ I thought I was supposed to vote ‘ yes ’ to cutting off the argument …as far as I ’m concerned we ’ve heard enough about Nancy ’s problem with the CIA … ”
“ But that was n’t about cutting off the debate , that was just technical … about allowing them to modify the previous vote … ”
“ What are you talking about ? ”
“ I do n’t know … I did n’t think it had anything to do with stopping all this gabbing about Nancy and the CIA … ”
And so goes the empire .

Moscow policeman opens fire in supermarket , killing three after argument with wife
This is the moment an off - duty police chief opened fire in a supermarket in southern Moscow this morning , killing at least three people and wounding seven .
' During the night Denis Yevsyukov had a fight with his wife and had a nervous breakdown , ' a city police spokeswoman said .
She said he then went on a shooting spree in the shop , randomly spraying bullets at passers - by after first returning home to change into his police uniform .
A TV grab from Russian NTV channel Denis Yevsyukov reloading his pistol in the supermarket Ostrov just after midnight in Moscow
Yevsyukov is shown loading his gun in the all - night shop .
He killed at least three people and wounded seven
Russian television broadcast CCTV footage from inside the supermarket showing Mr Yevsyukov calmly reloading his weapon as he walked down one of the food aisles .
Other reports claimed two people had died in the shooting .
Seven others were wounded , four of them critically , Russian investigators said .
Russian news agencies reported Yevsyukov was celebrating his 32nd birthday in a cafe with his wife and father - in - law before he became enraged when she apparently complained that he was spending too much time at work since being promoted to head the Tsaritsyno police district in southern Moscow in November last year .
Denis Yevsyukov at the Simonovsky court in Moscow after his arrest following his gun rampage
Yevsyukov , a major who heads a southern Moscow police department , was caught after killing a driver , a supermarket cashier and customer , federal investigators said in a statement .
Yevsyukov killed the driver of a Chevrolet car who had dropped him off outside the 24 - hour supermarket shortly after midnight .
He then entered the store and began shooting at random .
A female cashier was shot in the face and died instantly while a male customer was killed after being hit in the chest .
Six other people were wounded during the rampage , four of them seriously .
Russian television network NTV reported that supermarket employees activated a silent alarm to alert police as the shooting progressed .
Officers were met with shots when they tried to arrest Yevsyukov , the spokesman said .
They managed to overpower him without further injury and he was taken to a psychiatric hospital for examination .
' He was firing vigorously , putting up resistance .
It 's a miracle none of the boys taking part in the arrest were injured , ' a police source told the Itar - Tass agency .
Vladimir Pronin , Moscow 's police chief , told the Interfax news that Mr Yevsyukov had no memory of the crime .
He said : ' I talked to him at 4 am .
His eyes were as big as saucers and he did n't have a clue what had happened .
He just wept .
He was a great officer who was on a good career path – he obviously had some kind of psychotic attack '
Details of those killed were unavailable , but Russian news agency Interfax reported that four people were hospitalized with head injuries and they were aged between 19 and 23 .
Mr Yevsyukov had risen rapidly through the ranks since joining the force in 2005 .
He had solved dozens of serious crimes as a detective and had won promotion based on his exemplary work record .
Colleagues reported that he had complaining of problems at work lately .
Discover Prepaid Debit Card Gives Parents More Control
Are you a parent looking to give your teen access to money while still maintaining spending limits and control ?
Do you want a card that can help your teen learn how to be responsible with money ?
There ’s a new debit card by Discover that can help with just that —
The Discover Current Debit Card .
These types of teen cards are becoming more popular as it is becoming apparent how important it is to help get a young person off on the right foot when learning about money .
We all want our children to avoid bad spending habits , rack up debt , and learn how to manage money properly , but it can be tough for parents to keep up with everything .
That ’s where these teen - based cards can really help make it easier on parents .
Cards like the Discover Current card come with a lot of features that give parents the control they need while still allowing teens to access money as they would if it was their own account .
The Discover Current Debit Card
Introducing the Current card by Discover , a new kind of debit card for teens with built - in parental controls .
With Current Card , parents can add money easily to a card for their teens , set spending limits and e-mail or text message activity alerts , track purchases and access exclusive discounts online .
Teens can choose from one of seven unique teen card designs and have access to the following features and benefits :
Debit Card for
Teens with built - in parental controls
Set daily , weekly , and monthly spending limits
Restrict teen card use in unwanted shopping categories ( e.g. liquor stores , tobacco stores , hotels , etc . )
Free Direct Deposit for parents & teens
Free deposits from any credit card or bank account
$ 0 fraud liability guarantee
Withdraw cash at ATMs
Get exclusive discounts at teen ’s favorite merchants
Free e-mail and text message activity alerts
No minimum balances , loading fees , or credit check
Since this is a debit card and not a credit card , there ’s no credit check and all you need is a bank account to fund the card .
If you ’re looking to establish a credit history for your teen , then it ’s important to note that this wo n’t accomplish that .
At the same time , this also means your teen is guaranteed to get a card even if they do n’t have a credit history or you do n’t want to co-sign a credit card for them .
How Much Does it Cost ?
When you open your teen card account you will deposit an initial amount of at least $ 20 to each card .
You also choose a plan for each card and pay the first month ’s membership fee of $ 5 - or choose a $ 50 annual membership ( at a savings of $ 10 ) .
Once you choose the plan , the fee will be assessed for each card at account opening .
Other card fees are listed below :
Add money to the card – FREE
Four free ATM transactions per month per card ( each additional ATM usage is 50 cents )
$ 3 for a new card design or replacement lost / stolen card
Online print - ready statements – FREE
Copies of statements by mail $ 5
$ 0 inactivity or “ dormancy ” fee
Do It Yourself and Other Options
For the do - it - yourself parents , you can probably find a way to structure some accounts for your teen that accomplishes many of the same tasks for less .
Unfortunately , that also means you probably have to set up an account at the bank for your teen , may not have the ability to set automated spending limits , etc .
So if you ’re looking for simplicity , easy online control and reports , and the other unique features , a few bucks a month is probably not a big deal and makes the Discover Current Debit Card a good deal .
There may be some concern regarding the fact that it ’s a Discover card and it is n’t as widely accepted as say Visa or Mastercard .
It is worth checking to ensure that the card is accepted where your teen might use it , but in most cases there should n’t be a problem .
There ’s also another teen card out there by Visa called the Visa Buxx .
Unfortunately , this card has more restrictions and fees for many users .
For this card you have to sign up through a select group of banks , and if you do n’t have an account with the bank , you are typically faced with a fee each time you deposit money on the prepaid card .
So , if you ’re looking for a simple way to give your teen access to money using a card while still maintaining total control , I think this card is one of the best options available yet .

AUGUSTA , Maine ( AP ) �
A bill that seeks to make it easier for qualified patients in Maine to obtain medical marijuana appears to be headed to a statewide vote in November .
The Legislature 's Health and Human Services Committee voted 8 - 0 Wednesday to reject a citizen initiative that would have the state issue identification cards to qualifying patients and allow licensed nonprofit dispensaries to provide marijuana to those patients .
Mainers in 1999 approved a law to allow residents to possess marijuana for medical use with a doctor 's recommendation .
But patients contend there 's been no practical way for them to legally obtain the marijuana .
The Kennebec Journal reported that the bill will now go to Maine voters barring any unusual legislative maneuvers .

Got the following email the other day , concerning intellectual property issues and non-compete agreements :
I was wondering how Hashrocket handles intellectual property and non-competes with its employees .
Is it something that your developers are required to sign as a new employee ?
I ask because I got into a deep discussion with my boss about this .
The employee agreement he came up with basically says that he owns any software / web related intellectual property that I work on ( on and OFF the clock ) .
The non-compete section says that I can't start my own business or work for another firm in the same or surrounding states .
I have an issue with him owning the intellectual property for work I do off the clock .
It makes me less motivated to learn and be innovative when I 'm tinkering around on my own .
I have my pet projects that I do n't want him to have any part in .
His argument is that he does n't want his employees using company resources ( software and laptops ) to start their own business ... which gets into the non-compete .
The answer is an emphatic " NO ! " I do not require non-compete agreements to be signed by new hires at Hashrocket .
Neither do I try to claim ownership of work that they do off the clock ( open or closed source ) , a practice I learned from and admired at my former employer , ThoughtWorks .
Work done on the clock is a different story .
We have the notion of chartered projects , internal initiatives which you are paid to work on for at most 5 hours per week or when paying client work is not available .
If I 'm paying someone to work on something then Hashrocket owns it , end of story .
Actually , there could be some gray areas there , like bringing interesting outside projects in - house in order to make more progress on them , but in that case reasonableness is key .
Anyway , a non-compete agreement ( or non-compete clause in a larger contract ) restricts employees from engaging in similar work after leaving your firm .
I did n't like them as an employee and I do n't like them as an employer either , because I think they 're fundamentally unfair .
If as the owner of the firm I 'm insecure about my people leaving and competing with me , then I 'm doing it wrong .
Keeping my people from being innovative on and off the job is exactly the opposite of what I need to be doing .
The rationale that your boss used with you , that he " does n't want his employees using company resources ( software and laptops ) to start their own business " , is IMO such a cynical asshole thing to say to anyone .
I 've heard it before , and it always pisses me off .
The thought process does n't come up at Hashrocket because I require my people to buy and maintain their own computers .
Professional craftsmen have their own tools , yada , yada ... that 's the subject for a different blog post .
And paid software ?
Really ?
What do we actually use for Rails development that costs money ?
Texmate ?
( Use vim to solve that problem . )
I guess Adobe products are a notable exception there , but I still can't bring myself to look at the situation with such shortsightedness as to try and prevent someone from using tools that I purchased for them to further their career .
I just realized why that is -- I see my mission as their " boss " to help further their career !
( The rewards from treating your employees this way are immeasurable . )
Incidentally , non-compete agreements are not enforceable in California , but elsewhere in the USA they are legally binding , so you should be very careful signing anything with a non-compete clause .
My suggestion to people presented with non-compete clauses in their offer letters or as part of agreements signed post - hiring , is to strike the offending clause from the contract and initial the change .
Do that or refuse to sign the agreement altogether .
Yes , it takes chutzpah to do what I 'm suggesting , but c'mon now ... you should n't kick off your new job by bending over and taking the corporate shafting from day one .
Given the time and expense needed to find qualified hires nowadays , after some initial fussiness from HR or the hiring manager , the whole matter will be forgotten .
If they try to force you to sign under threat of termination then you really should be evaluating whether you wanted the job in the first place .
Seriously .
I do believe in a particular type of informal non-compete agreement , which I make verbally with all my people .
I ask my people to refrain from " moonlighting " ( doing side work ) of the same type that they do during the day at Hashrocket .
As an employer , you should do that too , but only if you pay competitively !
I can't forcefully prevent my people from moonlighting , but I discourage it strongly for one simple reason : burnout risk .
Rocketeers work very hard every single day of every single week , putting in 35 - 40 hours per week doing intense pair - programming .
I want them to go home and relax , so that they 're fresh the next morning .
Think that 's an unreasonable request ?
Do n't come work for me .
On a final note , I think it 's a good idea , as a company that sponsors open - source projects and encourages open - source work on the clock , to have signed contributor agreements from all employees .
I have n't done this at Hashrocket but I 'm going to look into it soon .
The Copyright Nazis ’ Latest Venue : Newspapers
Rupert Murdoch predicted this week that “ the current days of the internet will soon be over . ”
As dead tree newspapers ’ readership dwindles and Craigslist destroys the traditional advertising market , newspapers will increasingly try to capture value by charging for online content .
The Murdoch papers , he said , were “ already looking at that . ”
Perhaps not coincidentally , John Kerry yesterday chaired hearings on the future of the newspaper industry .
Representatives of several major newspapers and media chains called for an “ exception ” to antitrust laws that would allow the newspaper industry to agree on a common policy on establishing subscriber walls and charging for content , and form a united front against online content aggregators .
The sole voices of reason , Arianna Huffington of HuffingtonPost and Marissa Mayer of Google , warned that the industry would be shooting itself in the foot .
Kerry lamented the growing inability of newspapers to realize value from their “ intellectual property ” [ sic ] and expressed his desire to somehow enable them to prevent free access to their content without at the same time destroying the “ openness ” of the Internet .
That ’s a bit like wishing to eat meat without killing any animals .
The proprietary content industry is barely able to make money even with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , so to make their business model viable would require an intrusive surveillance state on the scale portrayed in Richard Stallman ’s “ The Right to Read . ”
Now , I recognize that there ’s a problem .
As traditional journalists never tire of pointing out , most of the content linked by bloggers and news aggregator sites was originally generated by old - fashioned shoe leather reporters .
And those people have to eat .
But if what reporters do is essential , the same does n’t necessarily go for traditional newspapers .
News websites and bloggers , arguably , do a better job than traditional newspapers at aggregating the content generated by reporters .
They do what journalists should do , and did do before the Lippmann model of “ professional objectivity ” turned journalism into a form of stenography : they have independent recourse to the realm of verifiable fact , and evaluate all the “ he said , she said ” statements of politicians and PR flacks in light of it .
In any case , regardless of whether the reporters are working for old - line newspapers or directly for online news aggregators , developing a business model by which they can be reimbursed for their work in an open - source world will be a real challenge .
Crowdsourcing and reader - supported gift economies are one possibility .
Sharing online advertising revenue to pay reporters for the “ first sale ” of their content is another .
Supporting the reporters would probably cost a lot less if they were paid directly by the end -users at the aggregation sites without having to support the useless eaters in the corporate offices as well .
As Huffington said , “ The discussion needs to move from ‘ How do we save newspapers ? ’ to ‘ How do we strengthen journalism ? — via whatever platform it is delivered . ’”
But the problem did n’t start with the Internet .
Despite all the bathos about the poor content generators having to eat and all , dead tree newspapers have been downsizing traditional investigative reporters for decades now .
It costs a lot more money to dig around and investigate the powerful than it does to run stories about JonBenet Ramsey , Shaundra Levy or Lacy Peterson .
It ’s more costly in terms of potential lawsuits and lost advertising revenue as well , compared to simply sending someone to the White House press pool to write down talking points from the guy behind the podium .
Close to half of newspaper content is generated by press conferences and news releases from government and corporate PR departments–and that ’s been true since long before the Internet .
So one way to support genuine investigative journalism might be to stop paying people to write down talking points in person , when the same thing can be achieved almost as effectively by cutting and pasting the talking points directly from the White House website .
And the Copyright Nazis ’ proposed solution , of putting online content under lockdown behind a paid subscription wall , most definitely will not work .
All that ’s necessary to circumvent such walls is one subscriber who knows how to cut and paste text into a blog post or an email to a discussion group , and the content is available for free online by a simple Google search .
What ’s more , the authoritarianism of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act is a paper tiger , in an age of strong encryption and bittorrent .
In the offensive - defensive technological arms race between the corporate state ’s attempts to keep proprietary content under lockdown , and free people who want to freely distribute information , the latter will always be a step ahead .
Business models that depend on proprietary content are simply becoming untenable for technological reasons , and all the horses and men of the RIAA and MPAA together ca n’t put them together again .
On the run : this critique of my views is interesting .
But I think there ’s a crucial assumption that is n’t right .
The question is n’t whether “ the banks ” are insolvent ; most surely are n’t .
Instead , some banks are probably insolvent .
So it ’s not the case that the costs of the PPIP are costs we ’d have to bear one way or another ; there ’s a lot of money going to institutions that would never otherwise arrive at the taxpayers ’ door .
And that , in a broad sense , is what ’s wrong with TARPish rescue schemes .
They try to fix the banks by driving up the price of a whole asset class .
Most of those assets are NOT held by the probably insolvent banks .
So it ’s a diffuse , inefficient way of tackling the problem — a taxpayer subsidy to basically anyone holding toxic waste legacy assets , rather than a direct infusion of funds where needed .
Contrast it with what the FDIC does when it moves in : it does n’t shower money on banks in general , hoping that this will solve the problem ; it seizes banks that are in trouble , and recapitalizes them .
To justify the scheme as announced , you have to either assume that the toxic assets are wildly underpriced , or take as a given extreme political and legal constraints preventing you from doing anything close to the right thing .
And about those legal constraints : it ’s funny how GM is being treated as a ward of the state , even though it has n’t formally declared bankruptcy , in a way that AIG — which is 80 % government - owned ! — is not .
100 Hours of Astronomy ( 100HA ) , taking place from April 2 to 5 , may already be the largest science outreach event in history .
This Cornerstone Project of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 ( IYA2009 ) will bring the universe to millions of people worldwide with live online programs and thousands of public star parties .
Tens of thousands of amateur astronomers already plan to be out among the public with their telescopes , especially for the 24 - hour Global Star Party to take place on Saturday the 4th as evening twilight sweeps around the globe .
There 's also " Around the World in 80 Telescopes , " a 24 - hour series of webcasts from research observatories on April 3rd .
Professional astronomers will take viewers inside their telescope domes and control rooms to show what they do and how .
Another project is " 100 Hours of Remote Astronomy , " with several observatories donating free observing time for the public to explore the heavens on their own .
Visitors can sign up to control a distant telescope online and take pictures with it ; no previous astronomical knowledge required .
More information is available on the 100 Hours of Remote Astronomy page .
And there ’s more to shoot for than the Moon , Saturn and other celestial delights .
Awards with prizes from 100HA sponsors will be given out for the best public events in several categories .
( Register your event here . )
The grand prize is a David H. Levy Comet Hunter telescope from Explore Scientific , autographed by the famed comet hunter himself .
All winners will receive a Celestron Sky Scout , an official product of IYA2009 , with more prizes to be announced .
Award announcements will be part of a special 100HA closing session at the International Astronomical Union ’s General Assembly in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil in August .
The prizes are for public events registered on the 100HA website .
Here all events worldwide are displayed in maps and lists so members of the public can find them .
Everyone wins in this global event , however , and there ’s something for everyone to take home .
Custom certificates of participation will be available for download by all organizers of events that get registered on the official 100HA global web site .
Organizers will share the results of their activities in an online report and a personalized certificate will be generated for download and printing .
The reports — along with photos and videos — will comprise a permanent record of 100HA and provide examples to others taking part in more IYA2009 public outreach efforts to come .
The International Year of Astronomy 2009 has just begun , but the world is taking its motto to heart : " The universe , yours to discover . "
The celebration marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's first astronomical discoveries , in 1609 .
Most annoying phrase known to man ?
I have been wasting time , those precious minutes of my life that will never return , by eliminating the odious phrase " known to man " from Wikipedia articles .
It is satisfying , in much the same way as doing the crossword puzzle , or popping bubble wrap .
In the past I have gone on search - and - destroy missions against certain specific phrases , for example " It should be noted that ... " , which can nearly always be replaced with " " with no loss of meaning .
But " known to man " is more fun .
One pleasant property of this phrase is that one can sidestep the issue of whether " man " is gender - neutral .
People on both sides of this argument can still agree that " known to man " is best replaced with " known " .
For example :
The only albino gorilla known to man ...
The most reactive and electronegative substance known to man ...
Copper and iron were known to man well before the copper age and iron age ...
In examples like these , " to man " is superfluous , and one can delete it with no regret .
As a pleonasm and a cliché , " known to man " is a signpost to prose that has been written by someone who was not thinking about what they were saying , and so one often finds it amid other prose that is pleonastic and clichéd .
For example : Diamond ... is one of the hardest naturally occurring material known ( another harder substance known today is the man- made substance aggregated diamond nanorods which is still not the hardest substance known to man ) .
Which I trimmed to say : Diamond ... is one of the hardest naturally - occurring materials known .
( Some artificial substances , such as aggregated diamond nanorods , are harder . )
Many people ridicule Strunk and White 's fatuous advice to " omit needless words " — if you knew which words were needless , you would n't need the advice — but all editors know that beginning writers will use ten words where five will do .
The passage above is a good example .
Can " known to man " always be improved by replacement with " known " ?
I might have said so yesterday , but I mentioned the issue to Yaakov Sloman , who pointed out that the original use was meant to suggest a contrast not with female knowledge but with divine knowledge , an important point that completely escaped my atheist self .
In light of this observation , it was easy to come up with a counterexample : " His acts descended to a depth of evil previously unknown to man " partakes of the theological connotations very nicely , I think , and so loses some of its force if it is truncated to " ... previously unknown " .
I suppose that many similar examples appear in the work of H. P. Lovecraft .
It would be nice if some of the Wikipedia examples were of this type , but so far I have n't found any .
The only cases so far that I have n't changed are all direct quotations , including several from the introductory narration of The Twilight Zone , which asserts that " There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man ... " .
I like when things turn out better than I expected , but this was n't one of those times .
Instead , there was one example that was even worse than I expected .
Bad writing it may be , but the wrongness of " known to man " is at least arguable in most cases .
( An argument I do n't want to make today , although if I did , I might suggest that " titanium dioxide is the best whitening agent known to man " be rewritten as " titanium dioxide is the best whitening agent known to persons of both sexes with at least nine and a half inches of savage , throbbing cockmeat . " )
But one of the examples I corrected was risibly inept , in an unusual way : Wonder Woman 's Amazon training also gave her limited telepathy , profound scientific knowledge , and the ability to speak every language known to man .
I have difficulty imagining that the training imparted to Diana , crown princess of the exclusively female population of Paradise Island , would be limited to languages known to man .
Earle Martin drew my attention to the Wikipedia article on " The hardest metal known to man " .
I did not dare to change this .

Nora O’Brien , an NBC Universal program executive working on the series “ Parenthood , ” died Wednesday after collapsing while on location in Berkeley .
She was 44 .
The cast and crew of “ Parenthood , ” a remake of the 1989 Steve Martin film , had taken an evening break from shooting and a few people , including O’Brien , were playing basketball , according to a friend .
O’Brien said she felt dizzy and then she collapsed .
She was taken to a hospital , where she was pronounced dead , friends said .
Colleagues and friends were shocked by the news Thursday .
Mark Stern , executive vice president for original programming at the Sci Fi cable channel , recruited O’Brien to join him at the channel as a development executive in 2003 after she worked for him at Trilogy Entertainment Group .
There , they collaborated on such projects as “ The Outer Limits ” TV show .
“ She was talented , smart and insightful , ” Stern said .
“ She had great integrity , not only about her work but also in how she approached life .
She stuck up for people no matter what ; she did n’t play politics .
She was really sincere , and that ’s rare in our business . ”
At the Sci Fi cable channel , O’Brien worked on shows including “ Battlestar Galactica , ” “ Stargate Atlantis ” and the acclaimed mini-series “ The Lost Room . ”
In early 2008 , she was promoted to a more prominent role at NBC Universal .
She became a vice president for drama programming at NBC ’s television studio , Universal Media Studios , working on such shows as NBC ’s short - lived “ Bionic Woman ” and “ Kings . ”
After working 11 years with O’Brien , Stern said that he hated to see her leave Sci Fi .
“ But it was very gratifying to see her blossom , ” he said .
“ She became an invaluable asset at Universal .
They saw in Nora what we had seen in her all those years at Sci Fi . ”
O’Brien , who lived in Santa Monica , was born Oct. 2 , 1964 , in Hartford , Conn .
She was a graduate of Boston College with a bachelor of arts in economics and communications .
She began her career at Reunion Productions in Boston , where she wrote and produced documentary films .
She is survived by her mother , Virginia ( Ginny ) O’Brien ; and six brothers and sisters .
Services are pending .

Advertisement Israeli police have destroyed the small illegal settler outpost camp of Maoz Ester in the occupied West Bank .
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law and widely considered a barrier to peace .
But the outpost of seven huts , east of Ramallah , was among dozens of sites also illegal under Israeli law , built without government authorisation .
The Israeli move comes after the US secretary of state called for an end to " any kind " of settlement activity .
Katya Adler , BBC News , Maoz Ester
The bulldozers tore down the shacks in moments .
Now children play in the piles of books and bedclothes , as their parents hammer the homes back together .
It is all an incongruous sight , in the middle of the surrounding expanse of barren hills .
But it is a familiar one for the settlers , who believe God gave them all rights to this land .
This outpost has been torn down and rebuilt several times before .
Palestinians call this a cynical game by successive Israeli governments who have yet to demonstrate they are really serious about dismantling illegal outposts , most of which are bigger and more established than this one .
As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned on Wednesday from talks with US President Barack Obama , his Defence Minister Ehud Barak warned settlers the outposts would be removed by force if negotiations failed .
The few families living at Maoz Ester vowed to rebuild the outpost .
Small outposts like it are periodically destroyed and often rebuilt soon afterwards .
But correspondents say it is much rarer and more politically difficult for the government to evacuate larger ones .
Israel pledged to remove the outposts under the 2003 " road map " peace plan , but has argued that the Palestinians have not met their parallel commitments to dismantle militant infrastructure .
Both Mr Obama and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Israel to freeze settlement activity during Mr Netanyahu 's US visit .
Mr Netanyahu has said he will not create new settlements , but backs development within existing ones , which he says is necessary to allow for the " natural growth " of their populations .
But in an interview with Arab news channel al - Jazeera , Mrs Clinton said " we want to see a stop to settlement construction , additions , natural growth - any kind of settlement activity " .
Israel has also agreed to halt settlement activity , but has continued to build - mainly in settlement blocs on the west side of the West Bank barrier , areas Israel hopes to keep as part of an eventual peace deal .
Close to half a million Jewish settlers live in communities around the West Bank , including East Jerusalem .
Some are there because of religious and ideological convictions , others live in settlements for lifestyle or economic reasons .
For Palestinians the settlements and the security infrastructure surrounding them are a major obstacle to their hopes of a viable state of their own .

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the start of the World War II .
It was arguably the first conflict that saw widespread front line coverage by photographers , many of whom had honed their skills during the civil war in Spain which immediately preceded it .
The language of photojournalism developed during the conflict , and publication in picture magazines which had the budget and desire to publish the images , such as Life and Picture Post , ensured that the public came to understand what made a news picture .
Today , there are many photographs from World War II that are burned into our cultural memory , such as Joe Rosenthal 's shot of the flag being raised at Iwo Jima , Robert Capa 's shots on the beach at Normandy or the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in Japan .
These are undeniably defining moments , yet one area of the conflict that has not been widely explored is the daily life of prisoners of war .
There are obvious reasons for this , but a new exhibition , Captured , at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester comprises a wide range of pictures showing daily life for those held captive .
The exhibition looks at the real stories behind those portrayed by Hollywood and contains photographs as well as many other items that have survived .
The pictures on show are not grand photographs , not defining moments ; they are snapshots of people whose lives have been shattered by a global conflict .
In one image ( top ) , we see an RAF crew member from a Halifax bomber that was shot down over Bremen in 1943 surrounded by officers from the Luftwaffe .
There is no violence in the picture , and yet it carries a weight of intimidation .
The RAF pilot 's eyes are down , avoiding contact .
I have no idea as to the events before or after this split second was recorded - but , as with all pictures , we can layer our own thoughts and beliefs on to it .
I find it a disturbing image and one that will stay with me , as I 'm sure the moment stayed with this man .
Other pictures of note include one taken inside a prisoner of war hut at Lamsdorf in Germany on Christmas Day 1943 .
It was taken by William Lawrence , who pretended to be too sick to attend roll call , hence the empty room .
We 've all taken a few risks in our time to get a picture , but this was a big risk .
There are plenty of pictures that show prisoners playing cricket , tending to vegetable gardens and putting on theatre productions which capture the quiet moments and the long days endured with nothing to do .
For me , though , one other picture that stands out is one of three German prisoners at Glen Mill camp in Oldham on Christmas Eve 1940 .
Strip away the situation and it's a delightful photographic study , with wonderfully tight composition and great tonal range .
The photographs on display are essential documents that help us to understand the conflict .
They are quiet , seemingly everyday moments that often pass us by .
So , while you are chasing the big news story , the lead picture , or the defining image , do n't forget that there are plenty of other angles to a story and plenty of other ways to reveal the world through a lens .
Here you can see a wider selection of photographs from Captured in a picture gallery .
Captured is on at the Imperial War Museum North 23 May 2009 to 3 January 2010 .

National Security : The Last Refuge of Scoundrels
If the Obama Justice Department ’s legal doctrine is allowed to stand , there will be absolutely no way of holding government officials civilly or criminally accountable for violating the rights of American citizens , short of a foreign power conquering the United States and putting its officials on trial .
Barring a new Nuremberg trial , the officials of the United States government are above the law when it comes to “ National Security . ”
That ’s the necessary implication of the Justice Department ’s call to dismiss Jewel v. National Security Agency , a lawsuit on behalf of Americans who were subjected to warrantless–and hence illegal –surveillance by the National Security Agency .
The administration , in calling for dismissal , advanced two morally repellent arguments .
First , it used the “ state secrets ” argument : that any such lawsuit would compromise the “ sources and methods ” of the NSA , and in particular whether the agency had relationships with any particular telecommunications company ( a disclosure , in particular , which would cause “ exceptional harm to national security ” ) .
The claims of the plaintiffs , it said , “ would require or risk the disclosure of information properly protected by the DNI ’s assertion of the state secrets privilege . ”
The “ very subject matter ” of the lawsuit “ would inherently risk or require the disclosure of state secrets . ”
( Thanks to Glen Greenwald , by the way , for posting the document with the money quotes highlighted . )
Second , the Justice Department claimed sovereign immunity for the government .
The first argument is , of course , complete and utter nonsense .
The NSA ’s technical capabilities for surveillance of domestic communications are notorious matters of fact , as is its pattern of relationships with AT&T and other telecom companies .
So translated out of legalese , the argument is simply that a lawsuit would embarrass some bureaucrats .
The second argument is utterly pernicious .
It means , in essence , that government officials cannot legally be held accountable for violating our liberties , because –wait for it !
– they ’re government officials .
Think about that for a moment .
If the government cannot be held liable for violating constitutionally defined rights , then what mechanism exists for enforcing those rights ?
Apparently , not much–aside from another country conquering the United States and putting its officials on trial .
You know , like the Nuremberg trials .
That claim , the bald assertion that the government ca n’t be called to account for violating our rights because IT ’S THE GOVERNMENT , rivals Nixon ’s claim that “ if the President does it , it ’s not illegal . ”
Such sheer executive chutzpah has n’t been matched since Charles I met writs of habeas corpus with the reply that the prisoner “ is being held at the King ’s good pleasure . ”
A high school civics textbook parody by Doug Kinney , published in National Lampoon back in the 1970s , mentioned that the Bill of Rights was “ kept around mainly as an example of good penmanship . ”
That was n’t much of a joke , even back then .
Today , things are even worse .
We ’ve got a Bill of Rights which is unenforceable because exposing the cockroaches of the police state to the light of day might be bad for “ national security . ”
That ’s about as bad as the insurance policy on Monty Python , with the clause in fine print reading “ No claim made by you will be paid . ”
The accretion of war powers around the office of President , over the past century or so , has resulted in legal claims resembling the prerogatives of a Stuart monarch .
The Obama administration seems to have reined itself in a bit compared to Bush ; it is n’t matching Cheney , Yoo et al in the sheer grandiosity of claims entailed in “ Unitary Executive ” doctrine .
But anyone who expected a serious scaling back of executive national security powers , comparable to what happened under the post - Watergate Church Committee , is probably in for a disappointment .
There are two lessons to be drawn :
First , the upward ratcheting of executive “ national security ” powers , unfortunately , is very much a bipartisan phenomenon .
And second , under Democrats as well as Republicans , “ National Security ” is the last refuge of scoundrels .

Graphene : Carbon As Thin As Can Be
Surprising mechanical , structural , and electronic properties of one - atom - thin sheets grab widespread attention
Video Flexible Future Graphene - based electronic components conduct electrical current even when they are flexed and stretched .
Manufacturers are working to incorporate that property into advanced wearable and flexible personal electronic systems , such as the one depicted in this future - concept video .
Byung Hee Hong , Sungkyunkwan University ;
Suwon , South Korea Launch Video * Macromedia Flash Player 8 is required to view video .
WHAT ARE THE KEYS to designing a material that rivets researchers ' attention ?
Rare and precious elements ?
Previously unknown bonding configurations ?
How about fascinating molecular and geometric structures ?
If those are the elements of a winning formula , then a simple thin sheet made from just one type of atom ought to be a scientific dud .
But that 's not the way things are shaping up for graphene .
First isolated just a few years ago , graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms tightly packed in a honeycomb structure — quickly grabbed center stage in the scientific world .
It does n't seem to be budging from there .
" Graphene is one of the hottest topics in materials science these days , " says Jannik C. Meyer , a postdoc at the University of Ulm , in Germany , who co-led a groundbreaking electron microscopy study of graphene two years ago .
Indeed , a quick peek at the numbers on the preprint server arxiv.org , which captures only a fraction of journal submissions , shows that well over 1,000 papers about graphene have been written since 2007 .
The widespread interest in this planar form of carbon stems from fundamental science surprises and a host of potential commercial applications .
Intrigued by the material 's combination of outstanding mechanical , structural , electronic , and other properties , scientists and engineers are eager to get to know graphene in detail .
They see bright opportunities to fashion circuit components from graphene for use in computing , digital displays , and other types of electronic technologies .
Researchers are also exploring methods for synthesizing graphene in commercial quantities , chemically modifying the material , and using it to prepare advanced composites .
These applied studies , as well as ones that focus on graphene 's fundamental properties , are taking place in academic and major industrial facilities , as well as in the labs of small start - up companies .
A popular starting point for telling graphene 's story is 2004 .
That 's the year Andre K. Geim , a physicist at the University of Manchester , in England , together with Kostya S. Novoselov , a postdoc at the time , figured out how to isolate and image single sheets of graphene .
Conceptually , however , the material has been around since long before that date .
For years , scientists have discussed and described the properties of many carbon - based materials in terms of sheets of graphene .
Graphite , for example , is described as a three - dimensional crystal built from graphene layers .
And fullerenes , including carbon nanotubes and buckyballs , which have been known since the 1980s , are thought of as wrapped or rolled - up forms of graphene sheets .

One lump or two ?
Depicting an area of a few square micrometers , this micrograph reveals the wrinkled topology caused by functionalizing graphene sheets .
The tallest features are red .
THE STORY could start even earlier because graphite has been used as pencil " lead " for centuries , which means that graphene actually has been close at hand for a very long time .
Every time someone scribes a line with the ubiquitous pencil , the resulting mark contains bits of this hot " new " material , Geim says .
But graphene is n't readily available in freestanding , single - sheet form in ordinary pencil markings , so its properties cannot be explored or exploited .
Not surprisingly , scientists have been trying for a long time to split graphite into its constituent parts .
For years , their efforts met with little success .
Early on , researchers tried a chemical method for thrusting molecules or atoms in between graphite 's layers to pry apart the graphene sheets .
This chemical exfoliation technique generally yielded a slurry or sludge of graphitic particles similar to wet soot .
The chemical method soon gave way to a mechanical approach to cleaving graphite .
By rubbing or scraping graphite against a surface , researchers managed to peel off microscopic chunks as thin as roughly 100 atomic layers .
Referred to as micromechanical cleavage , that method was taken up by scientists in many labs and worked well enough almost 20 years ago to produce graphite slivers that were optically transparent .
Yet the slices still were n't atomically thin .
More recently , Philip Kim and coworkers in the physics department at Columbia University sought to develop a more controllable , higher tech mechanical - cleavage process .
They attached a graphite crystal to an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) tip and used the device to make nanometer - sized graphite markings on silicon wafers .
Fondly referred to as the " nanopencil , " Kim's AFM " writing " instrument decorated the wafers with very thin graphite crystallites .
" It worked pretty well , " Kim says .
" We were able to get down to 10 or 20 layers , " but no thinner .
Jiaxing Huang / Northwestern U Pond-er this Floating like water lilies , micrometer - sized flakes of functionalized graphite oxide can be corralled successively closer until they coalesce into a centimeter - sized close - packed continuous sheet ( bottom ) .
Looking back to the first few years of this decade , Kim and Geim say that at that time no one really expected that one - atom - thick sheets of graphene could actually exist in a freestanding state .
Yet they were determined to see how thin they could go .
Geim explains that conventional wisdom based on decades - old thermodynamics arguments held that " freestanding " graphene — meaning a one - atom - thick film that 's somehow suspended or resting on a nonbinding support such as silicon dioxide — would be unstable against the " urge " to roll into a nanotube or other curved structure .
" At that time , graphene was considered a hypothetical or academic material , " Geim recalls .
Then in 2004 , Geim 's group turned that notion on its head .
Starting with flecks of graphite generated by mechanical cleavage , the Manchester team stuck these little specks of carbon onto adhesive tape , folded the sticky sides against the tiny crystals , and pulled the tape apart , cleaving the flakes in two .
By repeating this rather rudimentary splitting process a couple of times , they prepared thinner and thinner slices .
Indeed , they showed that some of the pieces were one - atom - thick bits of graphene that remain surprisingly stable even at room temperature ( Science 2004 , 306 , 666 ) .
Kim remembers well the day he first read about the Geim group 's results .
" I was shocked , " he recalls , " and kind of depressed . "
He had submitted a paper detailing his group 's work with the nanopencil just days earlier and was surprised to discover that he had been beaten to the atomically thin finish line by a team using such a simple method .
Kim quickly decided to abandon the AFM approach and began experimenting the next day with the " Scotch - tape method , " as the technique was soon to be called .
" It 's a simple brute - force method , " Kim says .
" But the beautiful thing is , it works . "
As Kim recalls , within one week , his group reproduced the Manchester results .
With the benefit of hindsight , the existence of one - atom - thick 2 - D crystals can be reconciled with theory .
A key piece of that reconciliation came from a transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) study in which Meyer teamed up with Geim and others to probe graphene 's structure .
TEM samples are typically prepared on a mesh or other holey support so that electrons can pass through the sample and reach the detector .
By using lithography and other procedures , Meyer came up with a way to drape graphene flakes across a scaffold made from microscopic wires , thereby leaving relatively large sections of graphene ( tens of millions of atoms ) hanging freely over the holes .
The group found that the one - atom - thick films were highly ordered yet slightly warped or corrugated — a structural feature that they argued was key to the 2 - D crystal 's existence and surprising stability ( Nature 2007 , 446 , 60 ) .

Thick and thin Multilayer graphite crystallites ( gray , 2 µm in diameter ; thinnest is 30 atomic layers ) can be thinned by successive peeling until they are reduced to a few , two , or just one ( ranging from dark purple to nearly transparent regions ) layer of graphene .
THE FINDINGS quickly drew other scientists to make their own samples and study graphene 's properties .
The material was found to be extremely strong and stiff and a faster room - temperature conductor of electrons than any other material .
Physicists were especially enthralled because graphene appeared to be endowed with some quirky relativistic properties .
As a result of the speedy and unimpeded way in which electrons travel through graphene , the electrons behave more like massless relativistic particles , such as photons , than ordinary electrons .
The upshot , according to Kim , is that this easily obtained form of carbon provides a simple and relatively low - cost lab system for testing the predictions of relativistic quantum mechanics — the kinds of predictions that previously were thought to be observable strictly in particle accelerators and black holes .
It 's no surprise that graphene 's unusual properties and promise for electronic applications grabbed attention and generated " a bit of hype , " according to Geim .
The way he sees it though , the basic science is fascinating in its own right .
" From a chemistry perspective , graphene is quite unique , " he says .
" It can be thought of as a giant flat macroscopic molecule of infinite size . "
He adds that graphene may turn out to be the first example of a whole class of one - atom - thick materials .
Time will tell .
Meanwhile , researchers are focusing on developing synthesis methods and applications .
The Scotch - tape " synthesis " method , though popular and fun to discuss , is n't likely to produce large quantities of graphene .
Experts say the trick is n't making the super - thin flakes , but finding them .
After transferring the peeled or exfoliated bits of graphite from the tape onto an oxidized silicon wafer , the user needs an optical microscope and a trained eye to help spot the rare graphene " needle " hiding in a haystack of thick graphite chunks .
Some of the members of the Manchester group who have that expertise recently formed Graphene Industries , a start - up company that sells individual microscopic graphene flakes for research .
Working on a larger scale , Vorbeck Materials , based in Jessup , Md. , is gearing up to supply graphene in ton quantities .
The company has licensed core technology to make graphene by chemical exfoliation developed by Ilhan A. Aksay , Robert K. Prud'homme , and coworkers at Princeton University , and it recently announced a joint research program with BASF to develop graphene formulations for use in the electronics industry .
According to John Crain , vice president of strategy and business development , Vorbeck plans to launch its first product — graphene dispersions for making electrically conductive coatings — later this year .
THE PRINCETON method for making graphene is based on science first reported in the 1800s .
According to Aksay , researchers discovered back then that treating graphite with strong acids forms graphite oxide and that heating the oxidized material causes it to expand dramatically .
The " expanded graphite " materials have surface areas of 20 – 100 m2 / g .
The Princeton group modified that more than a century - old process in way that oxidizes graphite more completely and coats its layers with hydroxyl and epoxy groups .
That process leads to highly exfoliated materials with surface areas exceeding 1,700 m2/ g .
Aksay explains that heating the graphite oxide to some 1,100 °C decomposes its functional groups , triggering the release of CO 2 .
As a result , gas pressure builds up quickly inside the solid until it exceeds the van der Waals forces holding the graphene sheets together ( Chem . Mater. 2007 , 19 , 4396 ) .
Similar to the pressure buildup that pops popcorn , the evolving CO 2 exfoliates the crystal forcefully , yielding mainly single - layer sheets .
Aksay notes that his team 's process induces defects and leaves some functional groups intact .
The imperfections cause the sheets to wrinkle , but that feature turns out to be helpful in preventing the sheets from restacking .
Other groups have taken related approaches to preparing graphene by exfoliating graphite chemically .
For example , Hongjie Dai and coworkers at Stanford University expose graphite to acid and heat but then treat the product , which includes multilayer graphite crystals , with oleum ( fuming sulfuric acid ) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide ( TBA ) .
That step further nudges the graphene sheets apart by inserting ( intercalating ) oleum and TBA molecules between the atomic planes , leading to single - and few - layer graphene samples ( Nat. Nanotechnol .
2008 , 3 , 538 ) .
" Graphene can be thought of as a giant flat macroscopic molecule of infinite size . "
Meanwhile , Jonathan N. Coleman of Trinity College Dublin , in Ireland , and coworkers have shown that graphite could be peeled apart without the use of any intercalating agents if a solvent such as N - methyl - pyrrolidone is used ( Nat. Nanotechnol .
2008 , 3 , 563 ) .
As the team explains , the key to success is selecting a solvent for which the solvent - graphene interaction energy matches the graphene - graphene interaction energy , thereby removing the sheets ' " incentive " to remain stacked .
By using that method , the group obtained 1 wt % monolayer graphene ( isolated by centrifugation ) ; they say the process could be improved to yield 12 wt % .
Coleman 's group followed up recently with another study based on the same principle .
This time they demonstrated that water - surfactant solutions can be used to disperse and exfoliate graphite .
The group reports that 40 % of the graphene flakes obtained in that study consist of fewer than five layers and 3 % of flakes are single - layer sheets ( J. Am. Chem .
Soc. , DOI : 10.1021/ja807449u ) .
One common thrust of recent studies , including those of Dai and Coleman , is to develop graphene synthesis methods that sidestep the use of graphite oxide .
Studies have shown that sheets isolated from graphite oxide — graphene oxide sheets — are poorer electrical conductors , even after being reduced , than pristine graphene .
Because reduced graphene oxide samples retain some oxygen - based functional groups , they are less attractive than Scotch - tape - cleaved graphene flakes to researchers studying certain types of applications , such as transistors and other nanoelectronic devices .
In contrast , scientists pursuing graphene - polymer composites look for ways to capitalize chemically on graphene oxide 's functionality .
Another common thrust is to develop methods for making centimeter - sized samples of graphene that could accommodate large numbers of circuit components .
Several strategies have been proposed recently .
In one study , Jiaxing Huang and coworkers at Northwestern University used a stepwise procedure to corral many small waterborne flakes of graphite oxide into successively tighter confines .
In that way , the group caused the flakes to coalesce into a high - quality , close - packed , continuous , single - atom - thick sheet , which they reduced chemically ( J. Am. Chem . Soc. 2009 , 131 , 1043 ) .
Meanwhile , Byung Hee Hong of Sungkyunkwan University , in Suwon , South Korea , grew centimeter - sized patterned sheets of graphene by using chemical vapor deposition to react methane and hydrogen on a nickel catalyst .
The group etched away the nickel , transferred the graphene sheets to other substrates , and showed that even upon bending and stretching , the sheets retain their useful properties .
That flexibility may play a key role in portable , foldable electronic applications ( Nature 2009 , 457 , 706 ) .
FUTURE FLEXIBLE DISPLAYS
and other devices may be made from billions of nanoscale transistors — logic and switching devices , in which graphene serves as the conductive channel instead of silicon , as in today 's devices .
Graphene 's knack for transporting electrons at top speed with little scattering is enabling electronics researchers to fabricate and test fast devices today .
For example , at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center , in Yorktown Heights , N.Y. , Phaedon Avouris ' team prepared graphene field - effect transistors with nanometer - scale electrodes and demonstrated an operation frequency in the gigahertz range — a record for a graphene device .
The team also determined that the operation frequency increases with decreasing device dimensions , a finding that bodes well for the ongoing trend to shrink circuitry .
The group predicted that optimized graphene transistors would work even faster — in the terahertz range ( Nano Lett. , 2009 , 9 , 422 ) .
Considered a hypothetical curiosity just a few years ago , one - atom - thick graphene has stormed the world of scientific research .
Much of the enthusiasm resides in the physics community , but chemistry is also playing a prominent role .
Witness that of the 374 graphene papers scheduled to be delivered at next month 's American Physical Society meeting in Pittsburgh , many of those titles include words like " chemical doping , " " chemical derivatives , " and " chemically modified . "
One of the researchers looking into chemically modified graphene is Rodney S. Ruoff , a physical chemist and professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas , Austin .
Ruoff and team members have customized the hydrophilicity of graphene oxide sheets by treating graphite oxide with organic isocyanates .
That procedure forms amide and carbamate ester bonds to carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on graphite oxide , thereby causing the functionalized material to form stable dispersions in polar aprotic solvents .
The dispersions ' stability enables the graphene oxide sheets to mix intimately with numerous organic polymers — a key step to forming composites .
As a result of these kinds of chemical modifications , Ruoff and coworkers prepared polystyrene - graphene and other electrically conducting polymer composites ( Nature 2006 , 442 , 282 ) .
In related work , Ruoff , Yoshitaka Ishii at the University of Illinois , Chicago , and coworkers prepared functionalized 13C - labeled graphite oxide and developed a method for probing the material via solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( Science 2008 , 321 , 1815 ) .
They propose that the method will be a powerful probe of chemical bonding networks in chemically modified graphenes .
" The chemistry part of the graphene story has only just begun , " Ruoff says .
" And because of the extraordinary number of levers that chemistry affords , there is sure to be a growing dialogue between chemists and researchers in other fields . "
Flexible Future
Graphene - based electronic components conduct electrical current even when they are flexed and stretched .
Manufacturers are working to incorporate that property into advanced wearable and flexible personal electronic systems , such as the one depicted in this future - concept video .

Every White
House picks its words carefully , using poll - tested , focus - grouped language to frame issues and ideas to advance its goals .
Mr. Bush ’s team did that assertively .
The initial legislation expanding government power after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , was the “ U.S.A. Patriot Act . ”
The warrantless eavesdropping that became so controversial was rebranded the “ Terrorist Surveillance Program . ”
The enemy was , for a time , dubbed “ Islamofascism , ” until that was deemed insensitive to Muslims .
Now Mr. Obama is coming into office determined to sweep all that rhetoric away , even if he is keeping much of the policy that underlies it .
Aides argue that they are not trying to spin their priorities through words , only to excise the spin applied relentlessly by the Bush administration .
But they are also trying to send a clear and unmistakable message that the old order is gone .
“ You have to tell the American public and the world that there ’s a new sheriff in town without opening up the jail and letting all the prisoners out , ” said Matt Bennett , vice president of Third Way , a moderate Democratic advocacy group .
“ The changing of the way they talk is a low - risk way of purging some of the Bush - era stuff without doing any damage . ”
Indeed , for all the shifting words , Mr. Obama has left the bulk of Mr. Bush ’s national security architecture intact so far .
He has made no move to revise the Patriot Act or the eavesdropping program .
He has ordered Guantánamo to be closed in a year but has not turned loose all the prisoners .
The troop buildup in Afghanistan resembles the one Mr. Bush ordered in Iraq two years ago .
In cautioning against the “ surge ” label , Mr. Reid clearly wanted to avoid associating the Obama strategy in Afghanistan with the Bush strategy in Iraq , a strategy that both he and the president opposed at the time .
The two have never repudiated their opposition to the Iraq buildup , even though many now credit it with helping to stabilize the country .
And any language suggesting parallels between the two approaches could aggravate the party ’s liberal base , much of which is already suspicious of committing more forces to Afghanistan .
There are lots of places to find information online — the problem is how to gauge the reliability of the information you find .
I like Wikipedia as much as anyone , but the grain of salt its openness requires can lend the information a bad taste .
Now , at least when it comes to the life sciences , there 's a new , free resource that 's about as reliable as you could want .
Nature Publishing Group , which publishes the highly - regarded international scientific journal Nature , is branching out into education with a website called Scitable .
Scitable , which launched in January , is aimed primarily at college and later students and who need help with their classwork .
According to Vikram Savkar , who heads up the new Nature Education effort ( and who , coincidentally , was in my graduating class in high school ) , students will typically follow the same approach most of us do when looking for information :
Go to Google , and often click through to Wikipedia .
Scitable aims to provide a source for information , backed by the century - plus of credibility the Nature name brings to the table .
For now , Scitable covers only genetics , but will be gradually expanding over the next few years to cover the other life sciences , such as botany and molecular biology .
It 's easily searchable and personalizable , designed to provide relatively high - level instruction with the ability to drill down to articles on every subtopic .
Any questions not answered by the articles can be posed to a panel of educators and researchers via the site 's Ask an Expert feature .
The site allows educators to create " coursepacks " for their students to facilitate their use of the site , and even provides a networking feature so students around the world can find others working on similar topics .
I would n't suggest sending most kids to the site , as they 're unlikely to grasp most of the information .
But in the several hours I 've spent on the site I 've learned quite a bit about genetics , and I think it could be an invaluable resource for me when my kids hit high school and need help with their science homework , as I know I will need help in order not to look foolish .
And of course , as a geek , I 'm a big fan of knowledge for its own sake .
Scitable has a way to go before it becomes a thorough resource for science students and educators , restricted as it currently is to genetics .
But it 's off to a great start , and I for one hope that it starts a trend of credible reference material being made available online for free .
What a difference a couple of months makes .

Ahead of G20 , tens of thousands take to London 's streets RAW STORY

Print This Email This UPDATE ( at bottom ) : Biden appeals directly to G20 protesters
Tens of thousands of trade unionists , environmental campaigners and anti-globalisation activists took to the streets of London on Saturday to start five days of protests before the G20 summit .
Organisers of the Put People First march for " jobs , justice and climate " have rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that the demonstration could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
An alliance of more than 150 unions and environment , charity , faith and development groups will march through the capital from Victoria Embankment to Hyde Park to demand action to save jobs , create a low - carbon economy and impose stricter controls on the finance sector .
The general secretary of the Trade Union Congress , Brendan Barber , said : " Never before has such a wide coalition come together with such a clear message for world leaders .
" The old ideas of unregulated free markets do not work , and have brought the world 's economy to near - collapse , failed to fight poverty and have done far too little to move to a low - carbon economy . "
Britain's Climate Change minister Ed Miliband met campaigners before the march got under way and said the " vast majority " were planning to protest peacefully .
" I think the kind of campaigning that people are engaged in today -- certainly what the organisers intend , what the vast majority of the people who are going on this march will do -- is the kind of peaceful protest that is very much part of our society , " he said .
Demonstrators travelled to London from all over the country .
Organisers said they were expecting hundreds of thousands of people to join the march .
Later in the day , campaigners were set to target companies and buildings which fail to switch off their lights , even saying they will try to enter ' offending ' tower blocks and offices .
That action is part of the global Earth Hour initiative which seeks to urge people to turn off the lights for an hour .
World leaders , including US President Barack Obama on his first visit to Europe since he took office , will gather in London on Thursday for the Group of 20 summit .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hopes the meeting will help set the world on the road to recovery from the deepest recession since the 1930s .
More mass protests are planned in London in the days leading up to the summit .
The police are most concerned about the potential for violence on Wednesday , dubbed " Financial Fools Day " by demonstrators , when an anti-war march will be held and climate change campaigners will set up a camp in the City of London financial district .
A British university professor has been suspended from his job after warning that bankers would be " hanging from lampposts " during the demonstrations , and finance workers have been warned to dress down to avoid attracting attention .
UPDATE : Biden appeals directly to G20 protesters
US Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday called for tens of thousands of protesters already on the streets of Europe ahead of a G20 summit next week to give governments a chance to tackle the economic crisis .
" I would hope that the protesters give us a chance , listen to what we have to say and hopefully we can make it clear to them that we 're going to walk away from this G20 meeting with some concrete proposals , " Biden said at a news conference after a meeting of center - left politicians in Chile .
Tens of thousands frustrated by the deepest global recession since the 1930s took to the streets of London Saturday , as well as thousands more in Paris , Berlin and Frankfurt , ahead of Thursday 's summit of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing economies .
" The action that is happening in London today I understand , and we will respond to it at the G20 , " said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who will host the London meeting .
Biden added : " I would say to the protesters that unless we talk , unless we attempt to deal with this changed circumstance we find ourselves in , there is no solution .
Things will only get worse . "
Protesters in London plan a series of mass demos ahead of the G20 and have rejected police claims that they could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .

We are traveling to Montreal in June for a family wedding .
This afternoon I started looking up prices on Montreal hotels .
In one tab I was consulting a Montreal metro map .
In a second tab I was checking out McGill summer accommodations , my alma mater , which I highly recommend for some of the lowest cost rooms in downtown Montreal .
I was also comparing information from a number of travel websites including hotels.com , venere.com , and tripadvisor.com ( all of which we recommend ) .
In my mind , I was walking along the streets of Montreal , remembering the years I lived there as a student , thinking about all the museums and restaurants and little shops I looked forward to sharing with my parents …
And then Neil told me the time was running out on the parking meter , and Whoosh !
I was transported through time and space !
Instead of walking down Rue Sherbrooke in Montreal in the late 1980 ’s , I found myself teleported to the Nob Hill Flying Star Cafe on Central Avenue in Albuquerque 20 years in the future .
Wow !
It was completely mind - bending .
And completely disorienting .
And it is one of the things I love about travel : being totally and utterly shocked at the realization that right now , at this very moment , I am where I am .
﻿
Welcome to LivingPianos.com , I ’m Robert Estrin .
Today ’s subject is about how to tune your own piano .
Can you tune your own piano ?
That is the real question .
I ’m going to provide you with the information so you will know if you can tune your piano , and if you want to tune your own piano .
But more than that , I ’m going to show you an incredibly valuable skill that you can all take to heart : how to touch up the tuning on your piano !
That is something I think every pianist should learn how to do .
I ’ve been doing it for years .
You ’re going to love it once you learn how to do this !
What tools do you need to tune a piano ?
You will need a tuning wrench , sometimes referred to as a tuning hammer .
Make sure it has a removable head .
You should look for a star head , not a square head .
Because with a square head , you only have four positions that you can put the tuning wrench .
That is really cumbersome because as you ’re going to discover , it ’s really hard to move a tuning hammer !
So , you want a star head that can be in many different positions .
That ’s going to be a lifesaver for you !
Do n’t skimp on your tools either .
It ’s not that expensive .
There are tons of them on Amazon starting at less than $ 40 .
Then you just need a couple of wedges so you can mute out some of the strings .
As you know , through most of the piano , there are three strings to each note .
You need to be able to hear just two of the strings at a time when you ’re tuning one string to another .
For tuning grand pianos , this is really all you need .
To tune a whole piano you can use software for the pitches , but these few tools are all you need to touch up your tuning .
Why is it so important to touch up the tuning of your piano ?
It can take hundreds of tunings before you have the skills to get a piano not just to be in tune , but to hold its tuning any length of time at all .
Any competent tuner can get a piano in tune .
But the first time you play it , notes can go out of tune .
It ’s really hard to set the strings and pins in such a way that the pitches will hold .
Touching up is a totally different ballgame .
Let ’s say you get your piano tuned .
A few days later you ’re playing it and notice notes drastically out of tune right in the middle of the piano .
It can drive you crazy !
You scheduled this tuning , you paid good money for it , and now your piano is just not fun to play at all .
What do you do ?
Hire them back for another tuning a couple weeks later ?
If you have the tools and the knowledge – You can touch up the tuning on select notes yourself !
Armed with these tools and the knowledge I ’m going to show you , you can alleviate the problem of stubborn out of tune notes on your piano .
And you can actually extend the tuning of your piano to last much longer just by going through and touching it up on a periodic basis .
Let ’s get right to work on this .
Now , my piano is pretty well in tune .
There are some notes in the very high register that are not perfect .
But those high notes are really very difficult to tune .
The slightest motion of the tuning wrench knocks the pitch way off .
To get it just right is very difficult .
The lowest notes on the piano are also difficult , for a different reason .
Particularly on smaller pianos , there ’s so little fundamental pitch it ’s hard to tell what pitch you ’re even hearing .
But
If a note in the very high or low register is out of tune , it ’s not going to affect you that much .
You ’re not going to encounter those notes nearly as often as you will with notes in the middle register of the piano .
So , that ’s what I ’m going to focus on here today , because it ’s the most value with the least work .
Let ’s start with middle C. Does it sound in tune to you ?
How do you know if a note is in tune or not ?
Do you look at a tuner to see if it ’s in pitch ?
No , because the important thing is for a piano to be in tune with itself .
If your piano is tuned to 442 and then you play A and you want it to be at 440 , that A is going to be out of tune with the rest of the piano .
When you ’re touching up the tuning , it ’s usually only one or two strings of a certain note that will be out of tune .
A unison goes out to make it sound funny .
It ’s not the whole note that is going to go out .
That rarely happens in any kind of uniform fashion .
You do n’t need a chromatic tuner for what I ’m showing you .
You do need to listen .
When one of the three strings is out of tune on middle C on your piano , instead of the pure sound , you ’ll hear waves .
If it ’s slightly out , the waves will cause a slow undulation .
As it gets more out of tune , they become quicker and quicker .
So , the first thing you do is find the three strings for middle C .
By pushing down the key , you release the damper so that you can pluck them .
Then you ’re going to follow the string all the way back to find the pin that associates with the right string .
When one string is low you can hear that slow wave .
Listen for it .
If it ’s even further out of tune , that wave will get faster .
This is what I ’m talking about .
You ’re playing your piano just after it ’s been tuned and a note goes out for no particular reason .
It can happen .
The weather or just playing hard can knock a string out of tune .
If it ’s right in the middle of the piano like this , you wo n’t even want to play your piano .
And you do n’t want to spend a bunch of money getting the whole piano tuned again .
Even just getting your tuner there , they have to charge you for their time , right ?
So what do you do ?
Well , the first thing you do is you identify which string is low .
You want to listen for it , so listen to the separate strings .
Go ahead , pluck them and listen .
See if you can notice which one is lower .
One thing you want to do is check to make sure the other two strings are in tune with one another .
You can do this by muting the string that is low .
Now you ’re listening to the other two strings .
Let ’s say those two strings are absolutely in tune with one another .
To be able to compare the out of tune string with an in tune string , having just one string sound with the out of tune string is better .
So , you want to mute one of the two in tune strings so that you ’re left with one string that ’s in tune and the one that is low .
Once again , you pluck the strings to be sure you got it right .
Push down the key to release the damper so you can pluck them .
Now you ’re ready to adjust the pitch .
When you try this the first time you will develop a deep respect for your piano technician , because it ’s really hard to get even one string in tune !
Now , you might just luck out and get it right on the first pull .
It can happen .
But you might go back and forth for five or ten minutes trying to get it locked in .
It ’s hard to believe how much effect the minuscule motion on your tuning hammer has on the string .
I ’ve seen my piano technician , who ’s a master concert technician , struggling to get the string locked to the right position .
This is because there ’s huge amounts of tension on the strings .
Tension builds up at all the points of termination .
Right near where the felt is , there ’s tremendous tension .
As soon as you hit a note hard , that tension is released on the other side where there is termination at the bridge .
You can get a note in tune , but with the first loud strike of the note , the string tension equalizes across the points of termination .
That ’s why it ’s so important once you get your piano tuned to give a couple of hard blows to the key so that the first time you play it loud , it does n’t go out of tune .
Now you want to pull the low string up to pitch very gently .
As you do this you will want to check to make sure you did n’t pull it too far .
Listen to the strings again .
First the string that is in tune , and then the one that was low before to see if it ’s still low .
If it ’s still low you are going to pull a little bit more .
When it ’s really close it ’s tough to hear which one ’s higher and which one ’s lower .
Once again , push the key down and pluck them .
Now if it ’s extremely close , you can listen to the difference between the slow undulation of the out of tune string played with the in tune string , compared to the purity of the two strings that are in tune with one another .
Once you ’ve gotten the two strings sounding in tune , listen to all three strings .
Now that note sounds good !
What you ’ve just done is tune one string on a piano that has somewhere between 220 to 240 strings !
It gets more complicated if your piano is really out of tune .
The pitch of the whole piano could be slightly low .
As you start tuning one section of the piano , the pressure that is exerted on the bridge in one area pushes the soundboard down affecting the previously tuned area of your piano .
So , you have to go through the tuning at least a couple of times to get anything to hold .
Tuning a whole piano is very complicated .
You also have the factor that smaller pianos do n’t have such pure sounds .
They have a lot of what are called overtones , which are color tones that are higher notes contained within the lower notes .
Sometimes those can conflict with the fundamental pitch of other notes .
So , skilled tuners know how to finesse the tuning to get a sweet sound out of all different pianos .
There is good news for you if you want to learn how to tune a piano like a pro !
There are software programs that can take the tunings from great tuners and take into account the size of the piano and the pitch you ’re starting with .
By sampling all the A’s on the piano , for example , it knows how much stretch you need .
It ’s still an arduous task to tune a whole piano .
So , I recommend all of you get your feet wet by touching up your piano .
This is something that will really prolong the tuning of your piano and save you when you have one or two notes that are out of tune driving you nuts !
Touch up tuning is a great skill to develop !
I hope this is enjoyable for you !
If you ’re interested in learning more about piano tuning I ’m happy to share with you a bit more about it .
Today I ’ve given you a valuable skill that any of you should be able to take to heart and make your piano sound better , longer , by touching up the tuning .

This list is a companion piece to the earlier “ 10 Cases of Liberal Hypocrisy ” , which took issue with Alan Colme ’s statement that only conservatives could be “ infected ” with hypocrisy .
The thesis was that hypocrisy is a sad part of the human condition , and no one person or ideology is immune .
In the interest of fairness , I decided to take on the other side , and was positively spoiled for choices .

Hypocrisy : Cycling to Work But Chauffeuring
His Documents in a Car
David Cameron is a conservative Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom .
He is a noted environmentalist and famously cycles to work on a near - daily basis .
However , he also has an assistant follow him in a car to carry his briefcase .
Two words , Dave : thumb drive .
You can decide where to stick it when you ’re riding .
9 John Wayne
Hypocrisy : The War Movie Hero That Never Went to War
Well , kinda .
I ’m being a little harsh here , but Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda jumped through hoops to serve .
In 1941 , Wayne was 34 years old with a failing marriage and four kids to feed .
Sure , his career was starting to flourish , but he definitely was n’t a star and he definitely was n’t rich .
So from 1939 - 1944 he got a 3A deferment ( deferred for dependency reasons ) .
In 1944 , Wayne received a 1 - A classification ( ready for immediate induction ) , but the president of RKO Pictures threatened to sue the government and Wayne personally if he enlisted .
A month later the Selective Service reclassified him 2 - A ( deferred in the national interest ) .
Wayne made 13 ( mostly war ) films during the war and became the very image of the American soldier .
He also became a bona fide star and made a few halfhearted attempts to serve , but never really followed up .
No one knows why .
But after the war , Wayne became “ the most famous Republican in Hollywood ” , and was an ardent anti-communist ( even supporting the House of Un- American Affairs committee ) .
All who knew Wayne said that not serving was “ the most painful experience of his life ” , and that it haunted him the rest of his days .
8 Mark Foley
Hypocrisy : Condemning Clinton ’s Sex Scandal While Sexting Underage Boys
Mark Foley was a Florida congressman who lamented that Bill Clinton ’s runaway sexual addiction caused his scandal with Monica Lewinsky .
And yet Foley had demons of his own .
On September 29th , 2006 Foley resigned his congressional seat after reports surfaced that he was sending sexually explicit text messages and emails to teenage male congressional pages .
Foley insisted he was not a pedophile and had never had sexual contact with any minor .
Then he dipped into the media excuse bag and decided to used ALL of them at once : he blamed his emails on a drinking problem , checked himself into a rehab clinic , and said that he had been molested by a clergyman when he 13 .
To top it off , he decided that NOW was the time come out , and bravely had his lawyer inform the public that “ Mark Foley wants you to know he is a gay man . ”
Many pages came forward after Foley ’s announcement , but Florida officials closed the investigation citing “ insufficient evidence ” to file criminal charges .
7 Robert Tilton
Hypocrisy : Prayer Fraud
Robert Tilton is an American televangelist who achieved notoriety in the ‘ 80s and early ‘ 90s through his TV program Success - N - Life , a very slick and well rehearsed perversion of the “ prosperity gospel ” .
Tilton promised that , for a $ 1000 pledge , he would personally lobby God on your behalf .
All you would have to do was send in your check and he would pray over the very letter you sent him .
Today , all of you know him as “ The Farting Preacher ” , but back in the day people sent their entire life savings to this guy .
At its peak , Success N Life was in all 235 American TV markets , and was earning $ 80 M a year , tax free .
But in 1991 , ABC News discovered Tilton ’s ministry threw away prayer requests without even reading them , keeping only the money or valuables instead .
When confronted with these claims , Tilton claimed that he would pray over computer readouts of prayer requests , or sometimes lay across piles of mail as he prayed ( even claiming that chemicals in those letters gave him two “ mini strokes ” in his brain ) .
Tilton sued ABC for libel in 1992 , but the case was dismissed and his show was off the air by October 1993 .
He later resurfaced on Black Entertainment Television ( BET ) in the early morning hours .
Ole Anthony , founder of the religious watchdog group the Trinity Foundation , said Tilton pays $ 50,000 per month for the air time , and estimates that Tilton ’s ministry is grossing $ 24 million a year using reruns or repackaged versions of older shows .
“ With no production costs , a fraction of his former TV time budget , his net must rival that of the good old days with absolutely no effort on his part , ” Anthony said .
6 Ted Haggard
Hypocrisy : Condemning Homosexuality While Practicing Homosexuality
Ted Haggard is the founder and former pastor of the New Life Church in Colorado Springs , Colorado ; a founder of the Association of Life - Giving Churches ; and former leader of the National Association of Evangelicals ( NAE ) from 2003 – 2006 .
Haggard has condemned homosexuality , and under his leadership , the NAE stated that “ homosexual activity , like adulterous relationships , is clearly condemned in the Scriptures . ”
Yet in November 2006 , he “ left ” all of his leadership positions after he admitted soliciting a prostitute for homosexual sex and methamphetamine .
After the scandal broke , Haggard entered three weeks of intensive “ counseling ” , overseen by four ministers who claimed to have converted him back to heterosexuality .
When pressed , they backtracked and merely said Haggard is a “ heterosexual with issues . ”
Ya think ?
5 Bob Barr
Hypocrisy : Opposing Abortion While Paying For An Abortion
Bob Barr , is a former member of the United States House of Representatives , representing Georgia ’s 7th congressional district as a Republican from 1995 to 2003 .
He gained national attention as one of several leaders who successfully impeached President Bill Clinton .
According to a sworn affidavit by Barr ’s ex-wife Gail , the longtime abortion opponent paid for her abortion in 1983 .
Barr never publicly disputed the affidavit , and the author of the Defense of Marriage Act even invoked a legal privilege during his 1985 divorce so he could refuse any questions on whether he cheated on his second wife with his now - third wife .
Barr has recently resurfaced as the Libertarian Party ’s nominee for President of the United States ( he lost ) .
4 Rush Limbaugh
Hypocrisy : Illicit Drug Sourcing
Rush Limbaugh is the host of “ The Rush Limbaugh Show ” , a nationally syndicated radio program devoted to conservative issues and news of the day .
On his program , Limbaugh has espoused a deep respect of law enforcement and tough penalties for drug offenders ( In 1995 , he said drug users “ ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up . ” )
Yet on October 10 , 2003 , Limbaugh announced that he was addicted to prescription painkillers and would immediately check himself into a rehabilitation program .
Law enforcement sources had noted that Limbaugh ’s name had come up during an investigation into a black market drug ring in Palm Beach County , Florida , specializing in the illegal sale of prescription drugs OxyContin and hydrocodone .
Limbaugh said he first became addicted to prescription painkillers following unsuccessful spinal surgery , but has remained clean since his 2003 treatment .
Limbaugh was not incarcerated because Palm Beach does not jail drug offenders unless they ’ve failed opportunities to deal with their addiction and have turned to crime to maintain their habit .
Thus , benefiting from the soft position on drug crime that he hates so .
3 George Bush , Sr .
Hypocrisy : No New Taxes
At the 1988 Republican National Convention , candidate George H.W. Bush famously said “ Read my lips : no new taxes ! ” .
It was a strong , bold statement , and the soundbyte resonated within the Republican party , which then backed him all the way to a successful election as the 41st President of the United States .
Once in office , Bush refused several new tax initiatives from a Democrat controlled Congress , but ultimately relented , and agreed to increase the amount of existing taxes in the 1990 budget agreement .
Rush Limbaugh went apoplectic and the general public was only slightly less enraged .
While technically the taxes were n’t “ new ” , they were still “ more ” , and that ’s not what his electorate him to do .
Bill Clinton then used Bush ’s quote to an easy victory in the 1992 presidential election .
2 Richard Nixon
Hypocrisy : Obstruction of Justice
In 1973 , Richard Nixon went on television and told the world “ I am not a crook ” as part of a total denial of involvement with the June 17th burglaries of the Democratic National Committee offices located in the Watergate Hotel .
But he and other high ranking administration officials were actually eyes - deep in it .
As a youth , Nixon was rejected by the FBI academy and later in life had to “ settle ” for President of the United States .
This always ate at him , and he loved the cloak - and - dagger aspects of covert operations .
Despite warnings to maintain plausible deniability , Nixon kept himself fully apprised of the break - in .
Then journalists Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein exposed the scandal in August 1972 .
The public disliked the burglary but loathed the cover - up even more , and popular sentiment led to impeachment processes that ultimately drove Nixon to resign the presidency .
1 Strom Thurmond
Hypocrisy : Blocking Civil Rights for His Own Child
When South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond ran for president in 1948 on the Dixiecrat ticket , he vowed to bar blacks from white schools , restaurants , and even some occupations .
But at the same time he was preaching segregation , he was secretly financing the business administration degree of Essie Mae Washington , a black coed at the all - black South Carolina State College .
Why ?
Because it is widely believed that Ms. Washington is his daughter .
By supporting a black woman he supposedly sired , Thurmond considered himself remaining loyal to a Southern Gentleman ’s code that required white boys , who often learned about sex “ on the colored side of town , ” to take care of any children they fathered .
To his very death , Thurmond never confirmed nor denied Ms. Washington as his daughter , even when the headline : “ SEN .
THURMOND IS UNPRINCIPLED — WITH COLORED OFFSPRING — WHILE PARADING AS A DEVOUT SEGREGATIONIST ” ran in the Edgefield Advertiser , where Ms. Washington went to school .

The int ( ) type gained a bit_length method that returns the number of bits necessary to represent its argument in binary :
The string .
maketrans ( ) function is deprecated and is replaced by new static methods , bytes.maketrans ( ) and bytearray .
maketrans ( ) .
This change solves the confusion around which types were supported by the string module .
Now , str , bytes , and bytearray each have their own maketrans and translate methods with intermediate translation tables of the appropriate type .
With the new syntax , the contextlib.nested ( ) function is no longer needed and is now deprecated .
Python now uses David Gay ’s algorithm for finding the shortest floating point representation that does n’t change its value .
This should help mitigate some of the confusion surrounding binary floating point numbers .
The significance is easily seen with a number like 1.1 which does not have an exact equivalent in binary floating point .
Since there is no exact equivalent , an expression like float ( ' 1.1 ' ) evaluates to the nearest representable value which is 0x1.199999999999ap+0 in hex or 1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625 in decimal .
That nearest value was and still is used in subsequent floating point calculations .
What is new is how the number gets displayed .
Formerly , Python used a simple approach .
The value of repr( 1.1 ) was computed as format ( 1.1 , '.17 g ' ) which evaluated to ' 1.1000000000000001 ' .
The advantage of using 17 digits was that it relied on IEEE - 754 guarantees to assure that eval ( repr ( 1.1 ) ) would round - trip exactly to its original value .
The disadvantage is that many people found the output to be confusing ( mistaking intrinsic limitations of binary floating point representation as being a problem with Python itself ) .
The new algorithm for repr( 1.1 ) is smarter and returns ' 1.1 ' .
Effectively , it searches all equivalent string representations ( ones that get stored with the same underlying float value ) and returns the shortest representation .
The new algorithm tends to emit cleaner representations when possible , but it does not change the underlying values .
So , it is still the case that 1.1 + 2.2 != 3.3 even though the representations may suggest otherwise .
The new algorithm depends on certain features in the underlying floating point implementation .
If the required features are not found , the old algorithm will continue to be used .
Also , the text pickle protocols assure cross- platform portability by using the old algorithm .

A BRAVE girl who tragically lost all her limbs to meninigitis is learning to walk again .
Five - year - old Ellie May Challis has become the youngest person in the world to be fitted with special carbon framed limbs .
The youngster touched the hearts of people across the county as she defied the odds to survive the killer bug which she contracted in 2005 .
Sadly Ellie May had to have all her limbs amputated eight weeks later .
People from across Essex rallied to support her parents Lisa and Paul Challis by holding fundraisers to pay for prosthetic limbs , but those have left her struggling to keep up with her classmates at Engaines Primary School in Little Clacton and her twin sister Sophie .
So her parents , who moved to Little Clacton from Rainham at Christmas , contacted world renowned prosthetic limb centre Dorset Orthopaedic to see if they could help and the firm made the specially designed new legs .
She was fitted with them three weeks ago – making her the youngest person in the world to have the £ 10,000 a pair special limbs .
Paul Challis , 45 , said : “ Ellie can walk twice as fast on these new legs .
She is so full of determination . ”
The company ’s managing director Bob Watts said : “ We had to make them especially for Ellie as they had never been made this small before .
We were worried that she would n’t be able to balance properly on them , but she has made amazing progress .
“ Within seconds of having them on , she was off .
It will change her life . ”
Ellie was originally fitted with NHS prosthetic limbs a few weeks after the operation , but she could n’t wear them as they were too painful .
Her new limbs will need to be replaced every two years .
Readers have helped support Ellie May by running various fundraisers for the family .
In south Essex more than £ 50,000 was raised .
Fundraisers have included Benfleet Rotary Club , who raised more than £ 1,500 by holding a race night and auctioning a Real Madrid shirt signed by David Beckham .
Lewis Joiner from the Rotary Club said : “ Her story has touched all of our hearts . ”
Burgers are everybody ’s favorite .
They ’re affordable and yummy with ketchup or mayonnaise plus tomatoes and lettuce .
They are well loved by both the young and old people anywhere in the world .
But if think that only the burgers of those popular international restaurant chains are the best tasting , you ’re not exactly right .
Denmark has its very own burger sandwich to be proud of .
In fact , the country ’s original burger is already celebrating its 60th year and is still growing strong .
The first Danish made ground beef patty sandwiched in between two pieces of bread turns 60 years old this week .
It was six decades ago when Denmark ’s original burger was first served to the public .
Thanks to the Pettersons family , this Nordic country can take pride in its very own hamburger that can match or even surpass the taste of those made by the more popular international restaurant chains .
The Pettersons are well known as the first family of hamburgers .
The family owns the “ Oscars Bof Bar ” situated in Kalmpenborg specifically at the Bakken funfair .
The bar first opened in 1949 and was the first to serve what was known then as only “ beef sandwiches . ”
The cost of the Oscars Bof Bar burger then was 1 kroner which was rather expensive as it was almost thrice the average hourly wage at that time .
But even then , the beef sandwich became a huge success .
Despite the existence of other burger chains in Denmark such as the Burger King which set up shop in 1977 and McDonald ’s which arrived in 1981 , Oscars Bof Bar continues to operate successfully with its own set of valued customers who have followed the tradition of the Pettersons .
Burgers , just like diamonds , are meant to last forever .
People will definitely crave for it wherever they go .
With or without the cheese , this beef sandwich is seen to remain an all time favorite anywhere in the world .
The FBI on Tuesday defended its raids on at least two data centers in Texas , in which agents carted out equipment and disrupted service to hundreds of businesses .
The raids were part of an investigation prompted by complaints from AT&T and Verizon about unpaid bills allegedly owed by some data center customers , according to court records .
One data center owner charges that the telecoms are using the FBI to collect debts that should be resolved in civil court .
But on Tuesday , an FBI spokesman disputed that charge .
" We would n’t be looking at it if it was a civil matter , " says Mark White , spokesman for the FBI 's Dallas office .
" And a judge would n’t sign a federal search warrant if there was n’t probable cause to believe that a fraud took place and that the equipment we asked to seize had evidence pertaining to the criminal violation . "
In interviews with Threat Level , companies affected by the raids say they 've lost millions of dollars in equipment and business after the FBI hauled off gear belonging to phone and VoIP providers , a credit card processing company and other businesses that housed equipment at the centers .
Nobody has been charged in the FBI 's investigation .
According to the owner of one co-location facility , Crydon Technology , which was raided on March 12 , FBI agents seized about 220 servers belonging to him and his customers , as well as routers , switches , cabinets for storing servers and even power strips .
Authorities also raided his home , where they seized eight iPods , some belonging to his three children , five XBoxes , a PlayStation3 system and a Wii gaming console , among other equipment .
Agents also seized about $ 200,000 from the owner 's business accounts , $ 1,000 from his teenage daughter 's account and more than $ 10,000 in a personal bank account belonging to the elderly mother of his former comptroller .
Mike Faulkner , owner of Crydon , says the seizure has resulted in him losing millions of dollars in revenue .
It 's also put many of his customers out of business or at risk of closure .
The raids are the result of complaints filed by AT&T and Verizon about small VoIP service providers whom the telecoms say owe them money for connectivity services .
But instead of focusing the raid on those companies , Faulkner and others say the FBI vacuumed up equipment and data belonging to hundreds of unrelated businesses .
In addition to Crydon , the data center of Core IP Networks was raided last week .
Customers who went to Core IP to try to retrieve their equipment were threatened with arrest , according to an announcement posted online by the company 's CEO , Matthew Simpson .
According to Simpson , the FBI is investigating a company that purchased services from Core IP in the past but had never co-located equipment at Core IP 's address .
Simpson reported that 50 businesses lost access to their e-mail and data as a result of the raid .
Some of those clients are phone companies , and the loss of their equipment has meant that some of their customers lost emergency 911 access .
" If you run a data center , please be aware that in our great country , the FBI can come into your place of business at any time and take whatever they want , with no reason , " Simpson wrote .
Faulkner says the FBI seized about $ 2.5 million from Simpson 's personal bank account .
Simpson did not respond to a request for comment .
Faulkner and others say that the FBI agent who led the raid , Special Agent Allyn Lynd from the Dallas field office , warned them not to discuss the raid with each other or with the press .
But a 39 - page affidavit ( .pdf ) related to the Crydon raid provides a convoluted account of the investigation .
It alleges that a number of conspirators , some of who may have connections to Faulkner , conspired to obtain agreements from AT&T and Verizon to purchase connectivity services with the telecoms .
Several documents used to provide proof of business ownership and financial stability were forged , according to the affidavit .
For example , the affidavit claims that one of the conspirators named Ronald Northern sent AT&T a bill from Verizon to show that he had a history of paying for services on time .
The bill was allegedly forged with Verizon 's logo – which the company is claiming is a trademark infringement – and that the corporation number the conspirator used actually belonged to a different Verizon customer .
Northern could not be reached for comment .
The affidavit claims that Faulkner , Northern and others committed mail and wire fraud , criminal e-mail abuse ( stemming from separate allegations of spamming ) , criminal copyright infringement and criminal use of fraudulent documents .
The affidavit mentions several companies that Faulkner has been connected to including , Crydon , Premier Voice and Union Datacom .
But mixed in with these allegations is a separate tale that hints at the larger story behind the raid .
AT&T and Verizon say they 're owed about $ 6 million in fees from VoIP service providers who used servers that were co-located at Crydon and the other data centers .
The telecoms claim that these VoIP providers used up more than 120 million " physical connectivity minutes " without paying for them , and that attempts by AT&T and Verizon to collect on the debts proved fruitless .
" Based on my investigation and that of AT&T and Verizon , " writes Special Agent Lynd in the affidavit , " I believe individuals associated with Lonestar Power and Premier Voice defrauded AT&T and Verizon out of hundreds of millions of minutes of physical connectivity service and significant revenue by means of the submission of false / fraudulent credit information and other false representations . "
Faulkner , who was a part owner of Premier Voice before selling it about a year ago , acknowledges that Premier owed money to AT&T at one time – though he says he 's not certain it was for interconnection .
He says that debt was assumed by the new owner when he sold the company .
Either way , he says , this would be categorized as corporate debt , not fraud .
" There 's a big difference between stealing money and owing money , " he says .
He says he often invests in troubled companies that are carrying debt when he buys them .
" Usually you settle the debt , " he says .
" But AT&T never contacted me about owing money .
Verizon never contacted me . "
Faulkner says the two telecoms have used the FBI to seize equipment to obtain evidence through a criminal investigation instead of pursuing the companies through civil litigation and the discovery process .
And instead of targeting the investigation specifically at the VoIP companies , he says the FBI swept in everyone who had servers in the same place where the VoIP servers were located .
As a result , all of Crydon Technology 's equipment was seized , as was the equipment of numerous businesses that had the bad luck to own servers running out of Crydon 's facility .
" They 're destroying more and more customers and it just does n't seem to make sense , " Faulkner says .
" They 've done a horrible amount of damage and have been so barbaric in the way they 've shut things down .
If they just picked some random guy off the street to do this investigation , he could have done a better job than the FBI did . "
Among more than 300 businesses affected by the raid on Crydon were Intelmate , which provides inmate calling services for prisons and jails and had about $ 100,000 in equipment seized in the raid ; a credit card processing company that had just become PCI compliant and was in the process of signing on its first customers ; Primary Target , a video game company that makes first - person shooters ; a mortgage brokerage ; and a number of VoIP companies and international telecoms that provided customers with service to the U.S. through servers belonging to a separate company Faulkner ran called Intelivox .
These customers essentially lost connectivity to the U.S. after the raid , Faulkner says .
Faulkner says the FBI appears to have assumed that all the servers located at Crydon 's address belonged to him , and did n't seem to understand the concept of co-location .
The seized data included transactional records for companies , which means the companies wo n't be able to bill customers for services already rendered before the raid .
" All of our clients will have to refund their customers , and we 're in the hole now to refund our customers , " says Faulkner .
" I could tell the FBI agent had never even considered that .
He just said , ' Well , that 's your problem . ' "
The owner of a credit card processing company who had servers at Crydon says he lost about $ 35,000 in equipment in the seizure , and that the survival of his company is at risk until he secures a new location .
He asked that he and his company not be named because the company is in the process of securing business partners to launch its processing service .
He fears that news about the disruption to his business operation could lead potential partners to avoid contracting with him .
To keep his launch on track , he 's had to purchase about $ 32,000 in new equipment .
He said when he tried to explain to an FBI agent that some of the servers that were seized belonged to him and not to Faulkner , the FBI agent implied he was lying .
" We were treated like we were criminals , " he said .
" They assumed there was no legitimate business in there . "
In addition to the transaction servers taken from Crydon 's facility , he also lost telephone service for his company after the FBI raided Core IP , which housed a business that was providing his company with VoIP .
FBI spokesman
White says the equipment seizures were necessary .
" My understanding is that the way these things are hooked up is that they 're interconnected to each other , " he says .
" Company A may be involved in some criminal activity and because of the interconnectivity of all these things , the information of what company A is doing may be sitting on company B or C or D's equipment . "
White says the FBI is working with affected companies to provide them with copies of seized data they need to run their businesses .
" It 's not that we 're doing nothing to assist them , " White says .
" We 've repeatedly asked the companies to call and provide us with the information we need so we can get the info they need back to them .
It is a time - consuming process . "
The owner of the card - processing company , however , says the FBI has been " completely unresponsive " to the needs of Crydon customers caught up in the raid .
An agent gave him a fax number to send the FBI details about the equipment that belongs to him , but the fax number did n't work .
Then , he says , the agent in charge took a vacation .
" They were all unavailable after they effectively seized all of our equipment , " he says .
An agent told the customer that no equipment would be released until agents could determine if it was used in criminal activity .
And if it was used for criminal activity , it would n't be released until after a trial .
" Our equipment could be there indefinitely , " the customer said .
" There 's been no due process ....
I consider this to be an issue for anyone owning a data center right now .
That they have this much power and can take anyone just because your equipment is inside a facility ....
They 're supposed to limit their search and seizure to the owner of the equipment . "
Faulkner says he 's managed to replicate mail servers and some functionality for some customers and is building up new business resources elsewhere – this time offshore in Panama , Mexico and Canada , where the FBI would have trouble seizing servers in the future .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has contacted him to investigate the FBI 's possible violation of due process .
Faulkner says when he visited the FBI 's office after the raid , he found numerous cubicles stacked full of servers seized in other raids that were waiting for someone to examine them .
The irony , he says , is that in the case of his servers the data was all hardware encrypted .
" It would take a lot of NSA time to crack just one of them , " Faulkner says .
Many of the allegations against Faulkner are based on claims from an unidentified informant who told the FBI that he used to work for Faulkner , and witnessed many criminal acts Faulkner committed .
The witness told authorities he was " unaware of any legitimate business being run by Faulkner and that as far as he / she knew all of his income was derived from his illegal activities . "
The informant also claimed Faulkner used crack cocaine and methamphetamine and engaged in commercial spamming .
Faulkner says the unnamed informant is a former employee who was fired after failing to show up to work over an extended period .
" We paid him $ 70,000 to help us launch a VoIP business , and he never actually did anything , " Faulkner says .
Faulkner says he does n't do drugs and he 's never conducted spamming nor been associated with spammers .
He says when he has discovered spammers using ISP services he provided through companies he owned in the past , he would block their activities .

If the people keep providing us with great images and videos from the Kentucky Derby , BC will keep posting them .
The photos just keep dropping .
And the stupidness gets turned up a notch each time .
This one begs the question , “ How many swigs off a bottle of Beam must it take for dude to strip down to the tighty whities and get his Slip ‘n Slide on ? ”
We ’ve been bombed many times in life and never , ever had the urge to get nearly naked and go muddin ’ on a piece of Visqueen as hundreds of frat boys cheered us on .
Not to be a prude but this ca n’t be the most comfortable ride .
It ’s not like the infield is smooth like the 8th green at Bethpage .
The other thought going through our foggy minds this morning is that those drawers look a little big , no ?
We must give a virtual high - five to this guy , though .
He had the balls to say ‘ f ’ it , “ I ’m going for a ride . ”
That is the spirit that continues to draw the freaks , drunks , gambling addicts , frat boys , used car salesmen , swindlers and the HST hat wearing community to Louisville .
You might have a losing ticket , a horrible hangover and several chicks numbers on the Verizon you do n’t remember getting but it was worth it .
Just think of all the stories being told this morning .
…. you guys wo n’t believe what I did this weekend …
“ Yeah , my whities looked like I took a huge shit in them . ”
“ The Derby was awesome ! ”

Harry Potter , Batman and even Nicole Kidman have all been bitten by the Twilight phenomenon .
DVD and Blu-ray sales of the cult teenage vampire film have reached a record - breaking 264,077 in its first week on shelves in Australia .
It means Twilight is the best selling Sony Pictures Home Entertainment DVD title in the first week of release in the past five years , beating out Australia , The Dark Knight and the past two Harry Potter films .

The criminal prohibition of cannabis is an indefensible public policy position .
Why can I say that ?
Just watch the video below .
It ’s been clear for quite some time that proponents of marijuana prohibition have nary a leg to stand on .
When their position is scrutinized , even the least bit , it ends up collapsing like a house of cards .
In this case , the look on FBI Director Robert Mueller ’s face two minutes and forty - three seconds into the video says it all .
His empty rhetoric has failed and he has no more artillery left in his arsenal .
He ’s been defeated and he knows it .
What ’s most amazing about this exchange is just how quickly it all unraveled .
Faced with the job of defending a multi-billion dollar public policy — one that ’s been in place for more than seven decades — one of Washington , DC ’s top bureaucrats found himself looking for a place to hide in under three minutes .
That ’s all the time it takes to destroy marijuana prohibition .
As the public support in favor of legalization continues to grow , we can expect to see more and more defenders of prohibition squirm like Mr. Mueller .
That is , if there are any public defenders still left to be found .

Play Latest Gamer ' Gamer ' is a high - concept action thriller set in a near future when gaming and entertainment have evolved into a terrifying new hybrid .
Humans control other humans in mass - scale , multi- player online games : people play people ... for keeps .
Mind - control technology is widespread , and at the heart of the controversial games is its creator , reclusive billionaire Ken Castle ( Michael C. Hall ) .
His latest brainchild , the first - person shooter game " Slayers , " allows millions to act out their most savage fantasies online in front of a global audience , using real prisoners as avatars with whom they fight to the death .
Kable ( '300 ' 's Gerard Butler ) is the superstar and cult hero of the ultraviolent " Slayers . "
Kable is controlled by Simon , a young gamer with rock star status who continues to defy all odds by guiding Kable to victory each week .
Taken from his family , imprisoned and forced to fight against his will , the modern day gladiator must survive long enough to escape the game to free his family , regain his identity and to save mankind from Castle 's ruthless technology .
Millions of people who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , such as naproxen and ibuprofen , should n't bank on the drugs helping them ward off dementia .
A study in this week 's Neurology suggests that NSAID users do not have lower rates of dementia and that increased use of the pain relievers may actually raise the risk of cognitive decline .
" We had high hopes that these non-steroidal arthritis drugs might play a role , in part because other studies had been promising , " says study author Eric Larson , executive director of Group Health Center for Health Studies , a Seattle - based HMO .
Researchers followed 2,736 members of Group Health who were an average age of 75 at the study 's start .
Participants were tracked for 12 years to see if they developed dementia , including Alzheimer 's disease .
Participants ' pharmacy records were evaluated for use of prescription and over - the - counter pain relievers , and they were questioned about their NSAID use as well .
Results showed 351 people had a history of heavy NSAID use at the study 's start , while 107 people became heavy users during the follow - up period .
Heavy users took at least one NSAID a day for at least 16 months of a two - year period .
During the study , 476 people developed dementia , and heavy NSAID users had a 66 % higher risk of developing the condition than those with low or no use .
Larson says he was surprised at the outcome because inflammation is thought to play a role in dementia and because other studies suggested anti-inflammatory pills lowered dementia risk .
" We have years and years of drug exposure data that was extremely accurate .
We did not expect these findings , " Larson says .
Duke aging expert Murali Doraiswamy says that the latest results are n't a revelation to him and that previous trials evaluating Vioxx , aspirin and prednisone , among other anti-inflammatory medications , did not show reduced risks cognitive decline .
" Any benefits noted in prior studies were likely due to an epiphenomenon — the people taking NSAIDS were younger , healthier and better educated , all of which biased the results . "
The study does n't disprove the theory that inflammation is a factor in Alzheimer 's , though , says Jason Karlawish , associate director of the Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania .
" Negative studies like this that fail to prove the hypothesis leave thousands of questions to be answered , " Karlawish says .
The new data highlight the need for early detection and better biomarkers , says Alzheimer 's Association vice president Bill Thies .
" If you could tell who 's going to need dementia drugs at age 40 and study them , you may have a totally different result . "
The German online magazine „ FreiesMagazin “ has started a programming contest yesterday .
The task is to write an AI for a two - player bejeweled - like game , where the stones that you can match cause your opponent to lose live points .
This evening I thought that this would be a nice finger exercise in Haskell programming , and indeed it was .
Most time was spent writing the code that communicates with the game supervisor ( via text files ) and that re-implements the game logic to simulate the next steps .
The example code is in C++ , so I had to do it again , but it ’s rather short : 123 lines , consisting of 8 lines for the module header , 26 lines for the data definitions , 16 lines for in - and output and 73 lines for the actual rules of the game .
Writing the rest was really easy .
15 lines use a generic Haskell module to implement alpha - beta - search in Strategy.hs , and 6 lines of code to glue it all together .
And I ’m sure one can do better ...
The program wins against the demo AI .
By choosing other algorithms provided by game - tree might even improve that .
Feel free to try it out !
My code is available in a darcs repository ( browse ) under the GPL2 or later and I invite everyone to use it as a base for contest entries .
If you want to use Haskell , you can just replace the Strategy.hs and do not have to re-implement the game logic .
If you submit such a program , just make sure you credit me appropriately .
Also , as always , patches are welcome .
If the code is too slow for your taste , you can decrease the depth parameter in Strategy.hs .

I use this NAS since 2009 and it is still alive :)
It has just been used for storing mainly images and some documenst .
With a today 's GigaBit LAN router you can get up to 8 MB/s upload and up to 12 MB/s download speed .
I would n't recommend it for streaming Full HD films , but it is still a reliable part of our home environment after 7 years .
Two days ago i bought this good looking , smooth blue light featured NAS with a capacity of 500 GB .
I started today to back up my files and explore the features of this Network Attached Storage solution .
First i need to say the setup and mounting process is very good explained in a step by step manual .
Even for inexperienced users it should be no riddle to connect the storage .
Besides the NAS the box contains an external power supply , Ethernet cable , CD - ROM with LaCie Ethernet Agent and Backup Software .
The whole thing is a small black box in glance design .
What i especially like is the smooth blue disk activity light which is placed in the bottom of the device and is reflected by surface on which it is placed .
Let 's see what is inside the blackbox :
Capacity : 500GB
Interface : Ethernet 10/100/1000
Mbits compatible

The next is Backup where you can do a complete backup of a to the storage connected USB device .
The Disk category informs you about the space on the storage and if connected on external USB devices .
The last one is Support .
Here you are able to enable FTP services , obtain the System Log , refresh your media list and restart the server .
On the CD you can find a Genie Backup Assistant which allows you to create backup jobs on schedule .
I just finished to set up and accomplish the first backup job .
The backup assistant is a step by step tool where you define the location ( source - destination ) , compression and security ( AES encryption and ZIP passwort ) of the files or folders you want to backup .
The backup job finished successfully and my backed up file is stored at the designated folder on the NAS in an encrypted container .
I set a weekly schedule as well .
With the restore assistant the file can be accessed and restored in it 's original state , All in all very clear and easy to use . ( the backup assistant is only the basic version what means you only have the option to backup on the NAS , but it 's no trial ) .
This little NAS is offered a little bit cheaper here .
Note : This is no affiliate link !
Just left to say i am pleased with this Storage solution and the price is ok as well .

When it comes to unleashing lawyers to make sure users pay for their software , the industry 's biggest players most frequently take aim at their smallest customers , according to Associated Press and an attorney I corresponded with about the matter .
From an AP story this morning :
An analysis by The Associated Press reveals that targeting small businesses is a lucrative strategy for the Business Software Alliance , the main global copyright - enforcement watchdog for such companies as Microsoft Corp. , Adobe Systems Inc. and Symantec Corp .
Of the $ 13 million that the BSA reaped in software violation settlements with North American companies last year , almost 90 percent came from small businesses , the AP found .
The BSA contends that small businesses are most often targeted because small businesses most often use unlicensed software .
However , according to an attorney who represents companies that have drawn BSA attention , it is the offers of huge rewards - upwards of $ 1 million - that creates an irresistible temptation for IT execs to rat out employers , especially former employers .
" The most frequent targets of BSA cases are relatively small firms frequently with 10 to 100 employees , " Rob Scott , an attorney with Scott & Scott , told me recently .
" As a practical matter , these firms usually have one or two in - house IT executives . "
Scott says his clients frequently suspect former employees dropped a dime on them .
" Many of my clients report that BSA investigations ensue shortly after the departure of the key IT person in the firm , " he says .
" While it is impossible to be 100 % sure because BSA does not disclose its informants , my clients regularly report that they believe that the person that was the rat - out was responsible for maintaining compliance with software licensing and in some instances actually installed the infringing software products . "
Screw up - unintentionally or worse - leave the job , snitch , collect the reward : Nice work if you can get it .
Of course , many of these complaints are simply the bogus whining of software pirates who knew better or should have known better ... and their irresponsible employers .
While the BSA 's tactics continue to draw criticism , the organization does claim progress in its primary mission .
Overall , the BSA says the worldwide piracy rate is 35 percent , down from 43 percent in 1996 .
However , the group says that because the industry has grown in that time , software companies ' annual piracy losses have quadrupled .
The BSA says piracy took a $ 40 billion bite out of a $ 246 billion industry in 2006 .
In the United States , where the piracy rate is a worldwide - low 21 percent , the BSA 's strategy includes working with law enforcement and Web sites like eBay to stop suspiciously cheap software sales online .

Understanding Git Conceptually
Introduction
This is a tutorial on the Git version control system .
Git is quickly becoming one of the most popular version control systems in use .
There are plenty of tutorials on Git already .
How is this one different ?
A Story
When I first started using Git , I read plenty of tutorials , as well as the user manual .
Though I picked up the basic usage patterns and commands , I never felt like I grasped what was going on “ under the hood , ” so to speak .
Frequently this resulted in cryptic error messages , caused by my random guessing at the right command to use at a given time .
These difficulties worsened as I began to need more advanced ( and less well documented ) features .
After a few months , I started to understand those under - the - hood concepts .
Once I did , suddenly everything made sense .
I could understand the manual pages and perform all sorts of source control tasks .
Everything that seemed so cryptic and obscure now was perfectly clear .
Understanding Git
The conclusion I draw from this is that you can only really use Git if you understand how Git works .
Merely memorizing which commands you should run at what times will work in the short run , but it ’s only a matter of time before you get stuck or , worse , break something .
Half of the existing resources on Git , unfortunately , take just that approach : they walk you through which commands to run when , and expect that you should do fine if you just mimic those commands .
The other half does go through all the concepts , but from what I have seen , they explain Git in a manner that assumes you already understand how Git works .
This tutorial , then , will take a conceptual approach to Git .
My goal will be , first and foremost , to explain the Git universe and its objectives , and secondarily to illustrate how to use Git commands to manipulate that universe .
I will begin by describing the Git data model , the repository .
From there I will describe the various operations
Git provides for manipulating the repository , starting from the simplest ( adding data to a repository ) and moving through the more complex operations of branching and merging .
I will then discuss how to use Git in a collaborative setting .
Finally I will look at the Git rebase function , which provides an alternative to merging , and consider its pros and cons .

" The note musicians call Middle C has a frequency of 262 Hz . " 262 Hz
In music there is an octave that is made up of eight notes .
It goes C , D , E , F , G , A , B , C , and continues up and down on a standard musical instrument .
The middle A , above middle C , has a frequency of 440 Hz .
To find the frequency of a note an octave higher the frequency is doubled .
To find the frequency of a note one octave lower the frequency is halved .
Frequency can also go in fifths by using the formula x ( 3/2 ) = y where x is the original note and y is the fifth note above the original .
Follow the octave going up and down where needed .
The frequency of middle C turns out to be 278.4375 Hz .
[ See editor 's supplement below . ]
There are different types of scales .
For example just intonation , equal temperament , mean tempered , American standard , and international standard .
Scales are built on ratios and fixed notes .
A different set of ratios and a different fixed pitch will result in a different value for middle C .
Since each scale has a different frequency for middle C , the frequency has also been known as 262 Hz , 256 Hz , and 264 Hz .
The frequency for one trial comes out to be 262
Hz because the frequency of the C one octave higher than middle C in that scale is 524 Hz .
In order to find the frequency of a note one octave lower the frequency is halved .
In general , the frequency of middle C is between 256 Hz and 280 Hz .

Result Circle of Fifths , Wikipedia , 2005 264.298 Hz
[ see explanation below ]
The circle of fifths is a method for generating a musical scale that is often credited to the Classical Greek mathematician Pythagoras .
Start with a note you like and multiply it by 3/2 .
This ratio is called a fifth .
If the resulting note is too high , divide it by two .
Multiplying and dividing by two changes the octave of the note .
Keep repeating this over and over again until you have all twelve notes of the European chromatic scale — the 7 notes corresponding to the letters A through G plus 5 extra notes midway between the original 7 indicated with the addition of a sharp ( ♯ ) or flat ( ♭ ) symbol .
The order in which this method generates notes is written clockwise around the circumference of a circle ; thus the name " circle of fifths " .
The student who wrote the essay above cites a page called Intervals and Notation that claims that C can be generated from A by the following procedure …
A - almost - an - octave - above - middle - C is at 440 Hz Raise a fifth to E - more - than - an - octave - above - middle - C 440 ( 3/2) =660 Hz Lower an octave to E- just - above - middle - C 660/2=330 Hz
Raise a fifth to B - almost - an - octave - above - middle - C 330( 3/2)=495
Lower one octave to B-immediately - below - middle - C 495/2=247.5 Hz
Raise a fifth to F- immediately - above - middle - C 247.5(3/2) =371.25 Hz Lower an octave to F - below - middle - C 371.25/2=185.625 Hz Raise a fifth to Middle C 185.625(3/2)=278.4375 Hz
Therefore , Middle C is at a frequency of 278.4375 Hz
This is not correct .
Acccording to the circle of fiths , to get to C from A requires a jump of 9 fifths up .
440 Hz * ( 3/2) ^9 = 16,915 Hz
Stepping down 6 octaves gives us a value in the desired range .
16,915Hz/2^6 = 264.298 Hz
Since the author ( or authors ) of Intervals and Notation jumped up 4 fifths , what they probably did was start at the A flat ( A♭ ) position on the circle by mistake .
Or perhaps they did not realize that the last jump at B would take them to F♯ , not F .

Buffer Overflow Primer Part 1 ( Smashing The Stack )
Description :
In this video series we will learn the basics of Buffer Overflow attacks and demonstrate how one can exploit Buffer Overflows in programs for fun and profit .
The pre-requisite for this video series is that you are familiar with Assembly language .
If you are not familiar with Assembly language , no worries , I have created detailed video tutorials for Assembly language here - Assembly Language Primer for Hackers .
In Part 1 of the Buffer Overflow series we will look at why buffer overflow attacks happen .
We will discuss how the program stack is laid out when a function call happens , then how a buffer can be overwritten if proper bounds checking does not happen and finally how a hacker could take control of the program by overwriting the return address stored on the stack to an arbitrary value .
We will use a sample program - Demo.c to demonstrate how it is possible to change the Return address by overwriting the stack using user supplied input .
Taiwan recently finished construction on a solar - powered stadium that will officially open later this year to welcome the 2009 World Games .
From Inhabitat , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Taiwan recently finished construction on an incredible solar - powered stadium that will generate 100 % of its electricity from photovoltaic technology !
Designed by Toyo Ito , the dragon - shaped 50,000 seat arena is clad in 8,844 solar panels that illuminate the track and field with 3,300 lux .
The project will officially open later this year to welcome the 2009 World Games .
Building a new stadium is always a massive undertaking that requires millions of dollars , substantial physical labor , and a vast amount of electricity to keep it operating .
Toyo Ito's design negates this energy drain with a stunning 14,155 sq meter solar roof that is able to provide enough energy to power the stadium 's 3,300 lights and two jumbo vision screens .
To illustrate the incredible power of this system , officials ran a test this January and found that it took just six minutes to power up the stadium 's entire lighting system !
The stadium also integrates additional green features such as permeable paving and the extensive use of reusable , domestically made materials .
Built upon a clear area of approximately 19 hectares , nearly 7 hectares has been reserved for the development of integrated public green spaces , bike paths , sports parks , and an ecological pond .
Additionally , all of the plants occupying the area before construction were transplanted .
Non-sports fans in the community have a lot to jump up and down for as well .
Not only does the solar system provide electricity during the games , but the surplus energy will also be sold during the non -game period .
On days where the stadium is not being used , the Taiwanese government plans to feed the extra energy into the local grid , where it will meet almost 80 % of the neighboring area 's energy requirements .
Overall , the stadium will generate 1.14 million KWh per year , preventing the release of 660 tons of carbon dioxide into atmosphere annually .

COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - The Tamil Tigers conceded defeat in Sri Lanka ’s 25 - year civil war on Sunday , with some staging suicide attacks to try to repel a final assault by troops determined to annihilate them .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa had already declared victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) the day before , and the military said the bulk of the fighting was over by the time the rebels said they had been beaten .
Even though there was little doubt about the final outcome of Asia ’s longest modern war , sporadic battles were still being fought late on Sunday and no one was willing to predict when the last bullet would be fired .
“ We are doing the mopping - up operations , ” military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said .
“ Suicide cadres are coming in front of troops in the frontline and exploding themselves . ”
Rajapaksa was due to make a formal victory announcement in parliament on Tuesday morning , but already flags were flying , people were dancing and lighting off fireworks in celebration .
The last act was playing out in what the military said was less than 1 square km ( 0.5 sq mile ) , where the LTTE carried out suicide attacks on Sunday before troops freed the last of 72,000 civilians who have fled over four days .
LTTE founder - leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran ’s fate remained a mystery , although military sources said a body believed to be his was recovered and its identity was being confirmed .
The LTTE , founded on a culture of suicide before surrender , at the last minute issued a statement from its diplomatic chief saying : “ This battle has reached its bitter end . ”
“ We remain with one last choice -- to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people .
We have decided to silence our guns , ” said Selvarajah Pathmanathan ’s statement , posted on the pro-rebel www .
TamilNet web site .
Pathmanathan , who is wanted by Interpol and was for years the LTTE ’s chief weapons smuggler , said 3,000 people lay dead and 25,000 more were wounded .
Getting an independent picture of events in the war zone is normally a difficult task , given both sides have repeatedly distorted accounts to suit their side of the story and outside observers are generally barred from it .
PRABHAKARAN’S FATE
Government forces on Saturday took control of the entire island ’s coast for the first time since war broke out in 1983 , cutting off any chance of escape for a militant group whose conventional defeat has been a foregone conclusion for months .
The military has in less than three years captured 15,000 square kms ( 5,792 sq miles ) the Tigers had controlled as a quasi-state for Sri Lanka ’s minority Tamils .
There was still no confirmed word on the fate of Prabhakaran , who built the LTTE into one of the world ’s most violent armed groups through hundreds of suicide bombings and assassinations , which earned it a terrorist designation in more than 30 nations .
“ They are taking the body for checks to confirm it is the real Prabhakaran , ” a military official told Reuters on condition of anonymity .
Four other military sources confirmed the account .
Nanayakkara denied Prabhakaran ’s body had been found , and that checks on a corpse were being carried out .
Slideshow ( 11 images )
The cataclysmic end to the war came after the government rejected calls for a truce to protect civilians , and the Tigers refused to surrender and free 50,000 - 100,000 people the United Nations and others said they were holding as human shields .
Each side accuses the other of killing civilians , and diplomats say there is evidence both have done so .
The U.N. rights chief on Friday said she backed an inquiry into potential war crimes and humanitarian violations by both sides .
A wave of diplomatic pressure from the United States , Britain , France and the United Nations last week , including threats to delay a $ 1.9 billion International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) loan , appeared to come too late to stop the final fight .

POST - WAR BOOST
Sri Lanka ’s $ 40 billion economy is struggling with depleted foreign exchange reserves , shrinking export revenues for tea and garments , rising import costs , a declining rupee currency and a balance of payments crisis .
Rajapaksa ’s government is counting on victory in the war to help boost the economy and renew economic growth that for years had been among the highest in south Asia .
The Tigers have warned that their conventional defeat will usher in a new phase of guerrilla conflict targeting Sri Lanka ’s economically valuable targets , an indirect threat to a tourism sector the government hopes can be boosted after the war .
Rajapaksa kissed the ground after he returned home early on Sunday from an official visit to Jordan , state TV showed .
The Tigers have answered earlier battlefield losses with suicide bombings in the capital , Colombo .
Prabhakaran began his fight for a separate state for Sri Lanka ’s minority Tamils in the early 1970s , and it erupted into a full - scale civil war in 1983 that has killed at least 70,000 .
Tamils complain of marginalization at the hands of successive governments led by the Sinhalese majority , which came to power at independence in 1948 and took the favored position the Tamils had enjoyed under the British colonial government .
An Indian foreign ministry official said there was no immediate reaction to the report of the Tigers conceding defeat .
From the ' what 's in a version number ? ' files :
TORONTO .
The open source Asterisk VoIP PBX is now at its 1.6.x release -- it 's a number that Asterisk is going to stay at for a long time .
That 's the message that Kevin Fleming ,
Director of Software Technologies at Digium and co-maintainer of the Asterisk told attendess at the IT360 conference here in Toronto .
Instead of changing version numbers for each new feature based release , Fleming explained that Asterisk will now put new features into its 1.6.x point release .
Currently Asterisk is at the 1.6.0 release with the 1.6.1 release in beta .
" Up until Asterisk 1.6 , the process was once new branch is out there are no new features in the branch just bug fixes , " Fleming said .
" That meant that if you had a new feature , it in might be a year or more till it showed up in production build .
Now we do add features in between point releases . "
As such the pace of innovation in Asterisk may well now accelerate since new point release come out every two to three months .
William Lyon Mackenzie King is often considered to be one Canada ’s greatest political minds .
King , who trained as a lawyer and worked as a professor before becoming a politician , eventually rose to the office of Prime Minister , where he served for twenty - one non-consecutive years .
But like most brilliant individuals , privately , King was off - his - rocker .
He frequently held séances in which he communicated with his dead mother , Sir Wilfred Laurier , Leonardo Da Vinci , and later , Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
The latter is almost certainly false though , as privately , FDR did n’t like King .
Although King managed to keep his fascination with the occult secret during his lifetime , many of his decisions were still guided by his ego and eccentricities .
Such was the case , when he decided to doctor a photograph , taken in 1939 , of King George VI , Queen Elizabeth ( the Queen Mother ) , and himself at Banff National Park in Alberta .
In the original photo , the three are enjoying a laugh amid the scenery .
Though we doubt George would be amused if he knew that he would later be erased from history .

The doctored photo of Mackenzie King and Queen Elizabeth .
( 1939 - 1940 )
By today ’s standards , the doctoring job is almost childish .
At close inspection , George has clearly been painted over with a tree and some flowers , the shadow where he was standing is still visible , and the brick underneath looks warped .
However , it seems that this forgery was good enough to fool the Canadian public , as the doctored photo was used in a campaign poster for the Prime Minister ’s reelection bid .
The flowers and tree in this altered photograph are obviously painted on .
Historians are n’t quite sure why King had George removed , but many believe that King wanted to look like he was in charge ; as without George , it looks like the Queen is looking up to him .
All photos are from the Library and Archives of Canada .

The impassioned views of America 's opposing camps on abortion are " irreconcilable " , Barack Obama conceded today in a contentious graduation speech at a leading Catholic university that was disrupted by hecklers , protests and arrests .
The president was drawn reluctantly into a confrontation with anti-abortion activists who opposed his end - of - term visit to Indiana 's Notre Dame university , but he gave little ground in his support for women 's rights to choose .
He urged campaigners on both sides of the debate to avoid " demonising " each other .
" No matter how much we may want to fudge it – indeed , while we know that the views of most Americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory – the fact is that at some level , the views of the two camps are irreconcilable , " said Obama as he accepted an honorary law degree .
His address to 12,000 students , relatives and teachers at the university 's sports arena was interrupted several times by hecklers , one of whom yelled " stop killing our children " .
Pausing while much of the audience booed the protester , Obama responded : " We 're not going to shy away from things that are uncomfortable . "
Some of the 1,200 - strong class of 2009 decorated their mortar boards with yellow Christian crosses and babies ' feet to mark their disapproval of Obama 's pro-choice stance and his support for stem cell research .
About 10 students walked out during the president 's speech and a splinter group boycotted the ceremony , preferring to attend a prayer vigil nearby .
But one graduating student , Michael Angulo , scrawled " viva Obama " on his cap , complaining that the furore surrounding the president 's visit had been whipped up by political groups outside the university .
Striving for common ground , Obama urged the rival causes to co-operate on issues such as reducing unwanted pregnancies and easing the process of adoption .
While engaging in vigorous debate in a " vibrant and varied democracy " , he said , they should remain civil while fighting for their causes with " open hearts , open minds , fair - minded words " .
" Maybe we wo n't agree on abortion , but we can still agree that this heart - wrenching decision for any woman is not made casually – it has both moral and spiritual dimensions ' , " he said .
He continued : " Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction .
But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature . "
Hundreds of protesters outside the university wielded placards with slogans such as " thou shalt not kill " .
A small plane flew over the campus pulling an anti-abortion banner and vans in the streets outside carried pictures of aborted foetuses .
Before the speech , police arrested 27 activists for trespassing on Notre Dame 's grounds .
Some lay down on the lawns , prompting police to carry them away .
Among those held was Norma McCorvey , known as Jane Roe in a landmark 1973 US supreme court case , Roe v Wade , which upheld abortion rights .
McCorvey , who has since disavowed abortion , told Fox News : " I 'm a peaceful protester , but if they come , they 'll just take me away . "
Earlier at the weekend , a former Republican presidential candidate , Alan Keyes , was taken into custody , as was an elderly priest , carried off singing " Ave Maria " .
A 167 - year - old institution founded by French missionaries , Notre Dame has hosted eight previous US presidents as graduation speakers .
Obama is not the first to be greeted with protests – Ronald Reagan and George Bush faced opposition over their support for the death penalty .
But Obama has angered many alumni by lifting a ban on public funding for charities which support abortion overseas and allowing funding for stem cell research .
A Gallup poll published this week showed most Americans opposing terminations for the first time in 15 years of surveys .
Some 51 % of respondents described themselves as " pro-life " , while 42 % considered themselves " pro-choice " .
Notre Dame 's leadership argued that opposition to Obama 's presence was largely from alumni or outsiders , with contemporary students overwhelmingly welcoming the president .
The university 's newspaper said that 73 % of letters from students backed the invitation to Obama .
Our nation has been on a collision course with simple , natural living for quite some time .
People in cities are crammed into high - rise apartment complexes , working 12 hours per day , eating fast food as a daily staple , and getting sicker by the minute .
What will it take to reverse this trend ?
Well , unfortunately , we do n't seem to be able to do this on our own .
It is taking an economic crash , the likes of which pales the 1929 fiasco to get us thinking about going back to the basics of growing our own food .
The truth is , for far too many of us , if we do n't start developing some basic survival skills , we simply wo n't eat .
So how do we go about growing some of our own food and eating healthy if we live in an apartment ?
It ’s simple .
Create a Freedom Garden .
There are several ways to do this in a limited space .
One way is to grow your veggies in pots indoors near windows , or with grow lights .
Another suggestion is to use balcony space and create vertical gardens in which plants are started in containers and trained to grow upwards on trellises , poles , or anything that encourages upwards growth .
Hydroponics gardens are another option , and can be made cheaply and easily .
These require no soil , just nutrients and water .
You can have fresh , organic tomatoes , lettuce , cucumbers , squash , and many other veggies right at your fingertips .
Start your project with something easy like squash , lettuce , spinach , carrots , or beets .
I live in the high desert , and these veggies grow outside like crazy here , even with the harsh weather and limited growing season .
Squash , lettuce , and spinach do not require much depth , but carrots and beets do , so remember this when creating your gardening space .
To get your Freedom Garden started , make sure that you get only Heirloom seeds .
GMO ( genetically modified ) or hybrid seeds will not work if you plan to harvest seeds for the next crop .
Once your veggies ripen , choose the best plants from your crops , and harvest the seeds for your next planting from them .
If you plant GMO seeds , it is likely that your harvested seeds will not be viable .
The same goes for hybrid seeds .
Heirloom seeds are the seeds that go back for hundreds of years , and are pure .
Their genetic makeup has not been tampered with through artificial genetic modification techniques , or cross breeding .
Choosing only the best plants for your seed harvesting will ensure that future crops yield the best results .
Also , be sure to gather extra seeds to create your very own personal seed bank so that you have something to fall back on just in case .
Here are some handy links for starting your Freedom Garden :
1 )
2 )
In short , one of the things that we cannot do without is food .
To stay alive , we need to eat .
If the shelves go bare , having a Freedom Garden in your apartment or backyard will be worth its weight in gold .
So pick a gardening method , whether it is by indoor or outdoor containers , or hydroponics , choose your seeds wisely , and start planting for food freedom .
This is the way to stay alive and healthy in today 's world .

Nancy Pelosi ’s Top Aide Was Briefed on Waterboarding in 2003
Nancy Pelosi is trying to use Patches O’Houlihan ’s five “ Ds ” of dodgeball , Dodge , Duck , Dip , Dive and ….. Dodge , on the issue of waterboarding .
She is trying use use them but it is n’t working , the more we learn and the more she scrambles the tighter the noose gets .
Nancy Pelosi was briefed in 2002 about waterboarding , she knew that the CIA had approved it and that they were going to use it .
She claims that she knew that the CIA could use waterboarding but not that they were using waterboarding .
It seems to me that if she had all of these morals that she claims to have and that if she thought that waterboarding violated these morals , and the morals of the United States , that the time to rise up and oppose waterboarding would have been in 2002 before anybody was waterboarded .
But she did n’t , she condoned waterboarding with her silence .
To feign disgust now is transparent .
CIA memos that were released last week show that Nancy Pelosi was briefed and did know that waterboarding was going to be used .
She can play semantics all that she wants but the truth has been learned .
But now we have learned that Nancy Pelosi ’s top aide was briefed on waterboarding in 2003 , after waterboarding was employed .
Are we supposed to believe that Nancy Pelosi ’s top aide was briefed on waterboarding and did not tell Nancy Pelosi ?
Are we to believe that on an issue this important her aide did not think that this was worth mentioning ?
Or did she tell Nancy Pelosi and Nancy Pelosi approved of waterboarding ?
Nancy Pelosi can Dodge , Duck , Dip , Dive and ….. Dodge all that she wants to but she knew about waterboarding in 2002 , her aide was informed that waterboarding had taken place in 2003 , and still she did nothing .
If , as Nancy Pelosi would have us believe , waterboarding is a crime and if those that approved waterboarding are to be tried for crimes than I would say that Nancy Pelosi is an accessory after the fact and should be tried as a war criminal also .
I look forward to the possibility that this administration will authorise investigations into the harsh interrogations that were used by the United States .
I ca n’t wait to see all of these people who knew what was going on and who are now outraged squirm as the public learns that they approved of these methods also .
The president has opened up a can of worms by releasing selected documents on the Bush administration ’s interrogation techniques and now it is too late to put the lid back on .
I ’ve been toying with my dropbar Bianchi mtb for the past six months or more , but there always seems to be something more that I …
This interacting group contains several galaxies ( called Arp 194 ) , along with a " cosmic fountain " of stars , gas and dust that stretches over 100,000 light - years .
Tocommemorate almost two decades of photographing the wonders of the universe , the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of a peculiar group of interactinggalaxies that contains a " cosmic fountain " of stars , gas and dustthat stretches about 100,000 light years .
Over thepast 19 years , Hubblehas taken many imagesof galactic collisions and close encounters .
The newimage of a trio of galaxies , called Arp 194 , looks as if one of the galaxies hassprung a leak .
The bright blue streamer seen in the image is really a stretchedspiral arm full of newborn blue stars .
This stellar activity typically happenswhen two galaxies interact and gravitationally tug at each other .
Hubble ' sresolution shows clearly that the stream of material lies in front of thesouthern component of Arp 194 , as shown by the dust that is silhouetted aroundthe star cluster complexes .
Resemblinga pair of owl 's eyes , the two nuclei of the colliding galaxies can be seen inthe process of merging at the upper left of the image .
The bizarre blue bridgeof material extending out from the northern component looks as if it connectsto a third galaxy but in reality this galaxy is in the background and notconnected at all .
The detailsof the interactions among the multiple galaxies that make up Arp 194 arecomplex .
The system was most likely disrupted by a previous collision or closeencounter .
The shapes of all the galaxies involved have been distorted by theirgravitational interactions with one another .
Arp 194 , located in the constellation of Cepheus , resides approximately 600 millionlight - years away from Earth .
Arp 194 is one of thousands of interacting andmerging galaxies known in our nearby Universe .
The newpicture was issued to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope , a joint NASA / ESA venture , aboard the space shuttleDiscovery in 1990 .
Thelast planned servicing of the telescope is scheduled for May .
Hubble hasmade more than 880,000 observations and snapped over 570,000 images of 29,000 celestial objects over the past 19 years .

Assembly Language for Hackers Videos
Part 1 : System Organization
Video description :
Assembly language is probably the most important thing one needs to master if he desires to enter the world of code exploitation , virus writing and reverse engineering .
In this multi-part video series Vivek will try to provide a simple primer to Assembly language which will help you get started .
These videos are in no way meant to be exhaustive but rather will only act as a guide on how to begin .
In this first part , he explains the basics of computer organization , CPU registers - general purpose , segment and instruction pointer .
Also covered is virtual memory organization , program memory organization , program stack and stack operations .
Part 2 : Virtual Memory Organization
Video description :
In this video we take an in - depth look at virtual memory organization concepts .
The entire discussion is explained by taking a live example using code .
We look at how one can use the / proc / PID / maps to peek into the layout of a program 's virtual memory and interpret useful things .
Also , we show how the Address Space Layout Randomization ( ASLR ) works in the latest 2.6 kernels and why this is significant from a security point of view .
We also show how this can be disabled at runtime if the need be .
This video is very important from an code exploitation perspective as it teaches us how to check for the presence of ASLR on a given system .
Part 3 : GDB Usage Primer
Video description :
GDB ( GNU Debugger ) is probably one of the most important tools one needs to be familiar with in order to be a good assembly language programmer .
In this video we go through a quick primer on how to use GDB to disassemble code , set breakpoints , trace through code , examine CPU registers and memory locations , examine the program stack and many other important use cases which will help us in later videos when we actually start coding in Assembly and want to debug our code .
We use C code example as the program in this video .
Part 4 : Assembly Hello World
Video description :
In this video we will look at the structure of assembly language programs - .data , .bss , . text segments , how to pass arguments to linux system calls in assembly , using GAS and LD to assemble and link code and finally in the end we go through a step by step approach to create our first " Hello World " program .
Part 5 : Data Types in Assembly :
Video description :
In this video we will go through an in - depth primer on data types which are used in assembly .
We do a live demo on how to look at data in memory using GDB for .ascii , .int , . short , . float ( .data ) and .comm , .lcomm ( .bss ) types .
Part 6 : Moving Data Around in a Program :
Video description :
In this video we look at how to transfer data between registers and memory locations using the MOV series of instructions .
We discuss data transfer between registers , immediate values and registers , memory locations and registers , immediate values and memory locations , indexed memory addressing schemes , indirect addressing using registers and many other important concepts .
It is important to note that all the above are explained in detail using example code in the video .
Part 7 : Working with Strings :
Video description :
In this video we will look at how to work with strings in Assembly .
We will demonstrate how we can move strings from one memory location to the other using the MOVS instruction set , discuss the concept of the Direction Flag ( DF ) and how to set and clear it using STD and CLD , how to execute multiple string copy instructions using the REP instruction , how to load strings from memory into the EAX register using the LODS instruction set , how to store strings from the EAX register back into memory using the STOS instruction set and finally we shall look at how to compare strings using the CMPS instruction set .
Part 8 : Unconditional Branching techniques
Video description :
In this video we will look at how to alter the program execution flow using unconditional branching .
We will look at how to use the JMP instruction to make an unconditional branching to a new location in the code segment and how to use the CALL statement in conjunction with RET to save the program execution state .
We will demonstrate all the concepts using very simple code snippets to aid understanding .
Part 9 : Conditional Branching using the JMP family
Video description :
In this video we will look at Conditional Branching in Assembly Language using the JXX family of instructions and the LOOP instruction .
The conditional jump instructions such as JA , JAE , JZ , JNZ etc. use various flags in the EFLAGS register such as the Zero Flag ( ZF ) , the Parity Flag ( PF ) , Overflow Flag ( OF ) , Sign Flag ( SF ) etc. to determine which instruction path to take next .
In this video we will look at the JZ condition jump instruction in great detail .
JZ using the Zero Flag ( ZF ) to determine if the last instruction resulted in the Zero operation or not and then chooses to jump to a specified location if it was set .
We will also look at the LOOP instruction which used the ECX register to loop over a set of instructions over and over again .
Part 10 : Functions in Assembly
Video description :
In this video we will look at how to write functions in Assembly Language .
The most important step in writing functions in assembly is to understand how to pass arguments to them and then read their return values .
We will look at 2 techniques - using registers and using global memory locations to understand how this can be done .
In this demo we will use our familiar " Hello World " program to demonstrate how to code a simple function using the " write ( ) " syscall .
We will use a program to demonstrate argument passing using the CPU registers and another program demo argument passing using global memory location in the .BSS segment .
Part 11 : Understanding the Stack
Video description :
In this video , we will look at how to use the Stack to pass arguments to functions .
In course of this video we will look into exactly how the Stack works , how to store arguments on the stack , how the " call " instruction stores the return address on the stack , the logic behind storing the EBP register on the stack , how and why EBP is used to reference function arguments and local variables in a function and how to adjust the ESP to accommodate all this .
This video is very important as a lot of learning from this will be used in the Buffer overflow video series Vivek plans to make next .
Socket Programming Videos
Part 1 : Basics and Socket APIs
Video description :
Socket Programming is one of the most important topics in network programming .
It is probably the building block of all network enabled programs .
In this 3 part presentation , we will look at socket programming in an in - depth way - both from a theoretical and a programming perspective .
In this video we will look at Client Server communication and architectures and see which APIs in the socket library are used to make the communication happen .
Part 2 : Difference Between TCP and UDP
Video description :
In this Part 2 of the Socket Programming presentation , we will look at the differences between a UDP server - client architecture and a TCP one .
Also we will dive deep into the data structures used for socket programming such a sockaddr_in .
Then finally we will set forth demystifying the byte ordering logic in network packets .
Byte ordering is probably one of the most confusing things for a beginner and hopefully this video should be able to help you understand it .
Part 3 : Utility Functions
Video description :
In this final video of the Socket Programming basics presentation we will look into utility functions for byte order conversion such as ntohs ( ) and htons ( ) .
Once the Byte ordering dilemma has been cleared , we will dive into the socket library calls such as socket ( ) , bind ( ) , connect ( ) , send ( ) , recv ( ) etc and try and understand how to use them programmatically in code .
Hopefully by the end of this video , you will be all ready for entering the world of socket programming .
Part 4 : Hello World TCP Server using Sockets
Video description :
In this video we will look at how to make a TCP Server .
To keep things simple to understand , this will be a Hello World server i.e. it will send a connected Client the string " Hello World " and finish servicing the Client .
The most interesting aspect of this video is that it is a " type with me exercise " - the user can type along to understand all the programming constructs better .
Part 5 : Hello World Server
Video description :
In this video we continue coding our " Hello World " server .
We will now encounter the most important API call - accept ( ) ( from a server 's perspective ) .
Accept ( ) allows the server process to accept client connections and process them .
We will currently run the server in an infinite loop , so that we can process clients one after the other .
The important thing to note here that this server process is not multithreaded and thus can only process a single client at a time .
To be able to process multiple clients asynchronous calls such as select ( ) or multithreading will have to be used .
Buffer Overflow Videos : Smashing the Stack
Part 1 : Overwriting Stack
Video description :
In Part 1 of the Buffer Overflow series we will look at why buffer overflow attacks happen .
We will discuss how the program stack is laid out when a function call happens , then how a buffer can be overwritten if proper bounds checking does not happen and finally how a hacker could take control of the program by overwriting the return address stored on the stack to an arbitrary value .
We will use a sample program to demonstrate how it is possible to change the Return address by overwriting the stack using user supplied input .
Part 2 : Writing Exit Shellcode
Video description :
In this video we will look at how to create Shellcode which we can use as payload while exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability .
Shellcode is nothing but machine code which the CPU can execute directly without requiring any further assembling , compilation or linking .
Thus instructions in the Shellcode will be executed as - is .
We will look at the exit ( ) syscall and see how we can convert the assembly language code for invoking it into shellcode .
In the process , we will be using the Objdump utility which ships with the Binary utils package .
After you have gone through this video , you will be able to convert almost any assembly code into it 's shellcode equivalent .
Part 3 : Executing Shellcode
Video description :
In the last video we saw how to create shellcode from assembly language code , this video will concentrate on how to execute the shellcode from within a C program to check that it is working properly .
In order to do this , we will use the exit ( ) shellcode which we created in the last video .
We then use ShellCode .c to launch the shellcode .
During this demo we will discuss how the main ( ) function is actually invoked by the __libc_start_main routine , which sets up the environment for the program and also cleans up after main ( ) returns .
We will see how it is possible to change the return address on the stack ( RET ) to point to our shellcode and have it execute .
Part 4 : Disassembling Execve
Video description :
In this video we will look at how to create shellcode for the Execve ( ) syscall .
We will first create a C program to spawn a shell using Execve ( ) , then we will disassemble the program to understand how the syscall works and the kind of inputs it expects .
We will cover this part in - depth and trace through individual instructions and recreate the program stack before execve ( ) is called .
Once the disassembled code has been understood , we will create our own program in assembly to spawn a shell using Execve ( ) .
This video is very important for those who want to learn how to convert a complex syscall ( ) into its working assembly language equivalent .
Part 5 : Shellcode for Execve
Video description :
In this video we will learn how to convert the shellcode created in the previous video to a more usable format .
It is important to note that the shellcode in the previous video cannot be used as - is becuase it contains NULLs and hardcoded addresses .
Thus we need to convert it into something which can be injected into a buffer - i.e. we need to remove the NULLs and setup relative addressing .
This video will show how we can replace the NULLs in the shellcode with instructions which results in non-NULL shellcode .
Also , we discuss in detail how we can setup relative addressing within the shellcode and modify it at runtime to make it work .
This is probably the most important video in the series , if one wants to understand the shellcode generation process completely .

The Queensland Opposition says an 89 - year - old man has been gnawed by mice while sleeping in a Darling Downs nursing home .
Opposition spokesman Ray Hopper says the war veteran was found covered in blood by nursing staff in the Karingal nursing home at Dalby on Anzac Day .
" The family of this gentleman contacted me very , very upset , " he said .
" He'd had the top of his ears badly , badly chewed , his neck was chewed , his head was chewed , he was covered in blood .
" It 's just unacceptable , - I just can't believe it . "
Mr Hopper says Queensland Health should have done more to prevent a mouse plague at the nursing home .
" I think Queensland Health should have done a lot more than they 've done , a lot quicker than they did .
" I mean where are the mice getting in - this is a new building ?
What is going on ? "
Queensland Health has rostered on extra staff and pest control agents since the weekend to kill mice at the home .
Traps are being emptied twice a day to stop the infestation .
However , federal Ageing Minister Justine Elliott says there is no need at the moment to evacuate the home 's residents .
She says her Department is monitoring the situation .
" There has been action taken in terms of the eradication measures that are in place - we are closely monitoring it , " she said .
" If we ever do find a situation where we do find it 's required to evacuate people , we do that very , very swiftly - that 's our main concern but we are closely monitoring the situation . "
She says she is concerned about the situation .
" The agency will remain there and monitor it very closely because this is a real concern in terms of the situation there and we 'll review that and see if future action should be taken .
" But my immediate concern is for the safety and the health and the welfare of the people in that home .
" I was as disturbed as anyone to hear of that . "
Extranjeros nos dicen qué virus nos atacan , y venden la cura
El abandono en ciencia “ nos convierte en un país dependiente del extranjero ; necesitamos que otros digan qué virus nos ataca y nos den los medicamentos para curarnos ” , advierte Rosaura Ruiz , presidenta de la Academia Mexicana de Ciencias .
México destinará en este año 6.6 % del PIB al rubro salud , del cual sólo 0.6 % será para desarrollo de ciencia básica y aplicada , señaló .
Entre las naciones de la OCDE , el país ocupa el último lugar en inversión : destina 0.33 % del PIB de 2009 , a diferencia de Suecia , que lidera la lista , con 4 % .
La organización recomienda una inversión de 2.26 % .
Ruiz Gutiérrez dijo que no invertir en ciencia “ sale muy caro : sólo en 2005 pagamos más de 2 mil millones de dólares por la compra de tecnología (...)
Estamos pagando la factura de no tener la infraestructura para analizar el virus ” .

[ digg - reddit - me ] I feel compelled to respond to Michael Scheuer ’s op - ed in the Washington Post .
A friend of mine who is in military intelligence brought the story to my attention with an approving comment .
Scheuer is a interesting thinker who have lived and breathed the world of Al Qaeda since before anyone else knew its name .
His analysis is always interesting – but his opinions are usually marred by his constant imputation of base motives to anyone with whom he disagrees on policy grounds .
This often makes him sound like a political hack rather than an intelligence analyst .
In his most recent op - ed , he claims that Barack Obama is “ a genuine American Jacobin ” placing ideology above reality .
( Scheuer does n’t acknowledge that one of the worse abuses of the real - life Jacobins was their torturing of opponents . )
Scheuer goes on :
[ T ]he president told Americans that his personal beliefs are more important than protecting their country , their homes and their families .
Scheuer believes that by ending American torture , the administration is “ enthroning Obama ’s personal morality as U.S. defense policy . ”
He argues that the bases for getting rid of torture are simply lies – that torture did not inflame Muslim anger and that it is effective .
Scheuer fails to make either point convincingly .
His proof that torture did not inflame the Muslim world is that other things make them madder .
( “ [ T ] hey do not even make the Islamists ’ hit parade of anti-U.S. recruiting tools ” . )
Certainly , American torture was not one of the core objections of Al Qaeda – but it did apparently inflame the insurgency in Iraq – as any student of history could have predicted , as torture has served a similar purpose in Algeria under French occupation and in Ireland under British occupation .
On torture ’s effectiveness , Scheuer simply expresses outrage that Obama would implicity question the integrity of those who authorized torture .
( “ [ T ] he president used his personal popularity and the stature of his office to implicitly identify as liars those former senior U.S. officials who know … that the interrogation techniques have yielded intelligence essential to the nation ’s defense . ” )
Scheuer point should be complicated by the fact that these officials now are seen to be liars because came forward to publicly castigate President Obama , at least in part on false premises – not because the president went out of his way to paint them as liars
Most inanely , Scheuer seems to think that it is merely Obama ’s “ personal morality ” rather than a concern for Rule of Law and our national character that motivates him .
This assumption of Scheuer ’s part makes him look like a political hack – as Obama has always expressed his opposition to torture as a matter of law and national morality – rather than his own human queasiness .
It ’s hard to understand how Scheuer can get into the mind of an Al Qaeda operative and convincingly describe the motives of a terrorist but is unwilling or unable to convincingly describe the thought - processes of his opponents closer to home , such as the president .
But the most interesting point Scheuer makes is in his opening hypothetical situation - which he abruptly drops in favor of his piss - poor political analysis .
The scenario Scheuer describes is this : we have captured Osama Bin Laden .
He declares that he knows where and when a devastating nuclear attack will hit America , but he refuses to give any further information .
Scheuer presumes torture is an efficient method of getting information , a kind of magical truth serum .
This is the type of ticking - time - bomb scenario that theorists often discuss but has never yet happened in recorded history .
Under these circumstances , Scheuer explains , Obama must order Bin Laden be tortured .
Given this hypothetical example – and if torture was believed to be effective – even Obama would have to agree based on his public statements and liberal positions .
This is what Scheuer does not understand .
Liberals do not oppose torture merely because they think it makes us look bad in the eyes of the world or because it violates their individual ethical principles or because they do not believe America has ruthless enemies or because they instinctually take the side of America ’s enemies – all of whcih either Scheuer or various other right - wingers have suggsted .
Liberals oppose torture because they know history – and they know that even the great and good can be corrupted by power .
That means , even America can be corrupted .
America was founded on a certain conception of the individual as having inalienable right that cannot be abrogated by the state .
Because of this , America has always been able to differentiate itself from it ’s enemies by the fact that it did not torture .
While the British tortured Americans during the Revolution , our fledgling nation survived ; as the American and Soviet armies marched across Germany our reputation for the humane treatment of prisoners led the highest value Germans to flee towards American lines to surrender to us .
To highlight this fundamental difference with our enemies , Ronald Reagan championed the United Nations Convention on Torture .
Liberals believe in the idea that is America – and refuse to preemptively surrender it out of fear .
Liberals know that once a government is allowed to torture , it is a very slippery slope to tyranny .
Which is why this torture debate has never been about the terrorists – it is about us .
Which is why I am sure that Obama would , and if not he should , order that Bin Laden be tortured in the hypothetical example above .
But to preserve the Rule of Law and “ the idea that is America , ” he would not try to hide behind talk of “ bad apples ” and legalistic memos .
He would have to take personal responsibility for this extraordinary and illegal use of authority – and once the crisis has passed he would have to appoint a special prosecutor to examine his actions and put them before the public in an open and transparent matter .
To preserve the Rule of Law , any one who ordered torture or who tortured would have to place himself or herself at the mercy of the public and law enforcement .
Postscript : Antother thing that Scheuer fails to acknowledge is that George W. Bush ’s torture regime was nothing like the hypothetical he offered .
Torture did not work quickly – and indeed lasted for months in the publicly acknowledged cases .
Interrogators had no ticking time bombs forcing their hand .
And in fact , we also know that some false information gleaned from torture was used to justify the Iraq war .
This is what torture has always been good for – not as a truth serum , but for extracting politically necessary confessions .

Most people have a difficult time conceptualizing the magnitude of the housing problem .
I hesitate to call it a housing problem since we do have homes , plenty of them actually .
At the root of it all is we have an affordable housing issue .
The bubble simply exaggerated the problem where it became too large to manage .
Folks keep hearing about companies losing billions and bailouts reaching into the trillions .
Some choose to ignore the crisis and some wallow in it too much causing psychological distress .
Or as many others are reacting , they are simply frustrated and angry .
The bottom line is you would be hard pressed to find a large group of people who think things are going well in our current economy .
I ’ve put together three Compton homes on the market to help you understand why we are in the mess we are in .
Examples usually help to make things more understandable or at least put a picture to the insanity .
Today we salute you Compton California with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
Dreaming of 1997 – 80 Percent Price Decline in Compton
Pink homes usually go hand and hand with Malibu Barbie .
Here is a great home for your Malibu lifestyle on a beer budget .
This home has taken this housing bubble on the dance floor and performed every move imaginable including the price decline tango .
Looking at the sale and price history , we can only imagine the stories it has to tell us .
This home is a foreclosure , one of the many thousands in California , and is listed as having 2 bedrooms and 1 bath .
It is 817 square feet and is now going for 124 days on the market .
I know , what a shocker .
Let us look at the wonderful pricing history over the past 124 days :
Price Reduced : 01/08/09 — $ 144,900 to $ 139,900
Price Reduced : 01/21/09 — $ 139,900 to $ 114,900
Price Reduced : 02/12/09 — $ 114,900 to $ 109,800
Price Reduced : 02/24/09 — $ 109,800 to $ 74,800
Price Reduced : 04/06/09 — $ 69,800 to $ 64,800
This totally makes all the sense in the world .
Let us list this home for $ 144,900 in January only to drop the price to $ 64,800 in April ( a reduction of 55 percent ) .
One important thing people need to ask is why in the world would you list the home for $ 144,900 in the first place ?
Is that the amount of the first mortgage ?
Only the seller can know for sure .
However , dropping the price like this tells us the state of the current housing market .
Is there no Barbie looking for this home ?
Heck , your PI payment on this place will come out to be around $ 350 !
Car payments are bigger than that .
You may be saying to yourself , “ okay , they mispriced the foreclosure .
So what ?
What does this have to do with showing us the history of the housing bubble ? ”
Oh , you have no idea !
Let us look at the sales history with a bit of running commentary :
Sale History
09/02/2008 : $ 184,800 < Lender taking place back .
01/26/2006 : $ 312,000 < What the heck ?
$ 312,000 for this place ?
Bwahahahaha !
Whichever bank made this loan should be taken by the FDIC immediately .
02/10/2003 : $ 138,000 < Nice little jump here for a few months .
Bubble picking up steam .
08/30/2002 : $ 85,000 < Whoops .
That only lasted a few months .
01/03/2002 : $ 104,682 < Hey , this home actually appreciated !
11/13/1997 : $ 93,000 < Get the price back up and ready to go .
07/30/1997 : $ 41,000 < A 50 % drop in the pre-bubble ?
Oh yes , these things do happen .
03/27/1997 : $ 85,000 < Pre-bubble days
That pretty much sums it up right there .
The lender who made that 2006 loan needs to be taken into receivership ASAP .
How do you make a $ 312,000 loan on this place ?!
If the home sells for the current price it is an 80 percent loss from the peak and puts us back to the early 1990s price range .
Garbage Can Photography Version 3.0
I ’ve been baffled by this garbage can photography marketing technique .
Maybe I skipped class that day when they were discussing Waste Management techniques in selling real estate .
Some agents have e-mailed me about other Real Homes of Genius saying , “ I ’m not getting out of my car to take a picture in this neighborhood . ”
Well , you are working for a commission and now it means doing some leg work … like moving the trash can from the lawn before you snap a picture !
And believe it or not , $ 70,000 is still a good amount of money for millions of Americans .
This home is another foreclosure .
This home is “ sold as is ” which is always a great sign of a quality product .
This is a 2 bedroom 1 bath home with a gigantic 546 square feet .
How do you get 2 bedrooms in 546 square feet ?
Math wizards please enlighten us .
This home has been on the market for 78 days and has already seen one price reduction :
Price Reduced : 04/02/09 — $ 79,900 to $ 69,900
A $ 10,000 drop is 12 percent for a home in this price range .
That is a big deal .
Aside from the great garbage bins ( I count 4 in the picture ) you would wonder why in the world a lender would put loans on this place of :
Sold ( 12/23/2008 ) : $ 185,066 < Home taken back by lender
Again the question is which lender made this loan of $ 185,066 ?
Incredible .
Do n’t you feel excited that you are bailing out institutions that made these kind of loans ?
According to the U.S. Treasury this home loan is a “ legacy asset ” instead of toxic waste .
In addition , through the public private investment program , the American taxpayer will be the proud recipient of many of these loans including those garbage cans .
I ’m sure many of you are just itching to buy these homes !
Oh , and they happened to take the picture on a rainy Southern California day !
We have approximately 10 days out of 365 where it is raining and they decide to take a picture with garbage cans and rain !
They are really doing their absolute best to market this place .
Do n’t try to sell this home so fast !
We ’ll Beat Any Advertised Price or Your Mattress is Freeee !
Those comedians at the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are going in complete circles as to the best approach of tackling this problem .
Money for Bank of America ?
Goldman Sachs ?
JP Morgan ?
Wells Fargo ?
AIG ?
So many choices !
Why give out trillions to your crony banking buddies when all you need to do is give a free mattress with every home purchase ?
Now with this home , we get a nice combination .
Not only do we get Garbage Can Photography 2.0 but we also get Mattress Photography 1.0 .
This is a larger home .
4 bedrooms and 2 baths and is listed at 1,314 square feet .
It has been on the market for 126 days .
Let us see the pricing action again :
Price Reduced : 02/04/09 — $ 169,900 to $ 159,900
Price Reduced : 02/24/09 — $ 159,900 to $ 139,900
Price Reduced : 04/01/09 — $ 139,900 to $ 114,900
Great price right ?
Small caveat .
The stinking unemployment rate in California is 11.2 percent !
Have you taken a look at Detroit home prices ?
There is a reason why some homes are priced at very low levels .
Unemployment does not help in boosting prices .
And this is one key point I want to drive home to all the bottom dwellers .
Until you stabilize the employment situation , you can focus all you want on mortgages and cheap credit but what use is that when people are struggling to find employment ?
You ’re going to make your mortgage payment with a $ 300 weekly unemployment check ?
I ’ve seen various sources talking about job growth during the housing bubble decade here in California and estimates from 40 to 50 percent of all job growth can be attributed to housing , finance , and industries tied to the real estate market .
With that said , it is important to look at places like Compton since it is good to have an idea of what we have been purchasing through bailouts of the banks and Wall Street .
I think I answered my question as to why banks are n’t dolling the homes up .
With all these bailouts given to any bank , why fix a home when the government is gearing up to buy them as is ?
Today we salute you Compton with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

Obama ’s Drug Czar Nominee Approved a Potential Break from the Past
This week , Obama ’s drug czar nominee was approved by the senate .
Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske , has the potential to be the best drug czar ever appointed to that position .
We may finally get a pragmatic solutions - oriented approach to drug control rather than drug war rhetoric that prevents real solutions .
While drug policy reformers were advocating for a public health professional as drug czar , President Obama went with a police chief .
He made a potentially ground - breaking pick as the former police chief of Seattle has been good on needle exchange , medical marijuana , treatment and health services for addicts and he ushered in a new law to make marijuana the lowest prosecution priority in Seattle .
He is a pragmatist who could shift the United States away from continuing to make the same mistakes over and over when it comes to drug policy .
The drug war is the issue I ’ve worked most on over the last thirty years and one I follow very closely as president of Common Sense for Drug Policy .
Drugs are an issue that seem unsolvable in the U.S. because every administration does the same thing — emphasizes enforcement at the expense of effectiveness .
It is not surprising that doing the same thing over and over and getting the same result over and over makes a problem look unsolvable .
In fact , there are lots of changes that can be made — even within the confines of drug prohibition — that can improve the situation .
When I served on Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke ’s Working Group on Drug Policy in the late 1980s he asked us to come up with policies — within the framework of keeping drugs illegal ( since he could not change that as a mayor ) — that would improve how drugs were handled in Baltimore .
There was a lot Schmoke did that made a positive difference , e.g. needle exchange , drug courts , treatment on request and social services for addicts .
Obama ’s police chief drug czar comes from a city that has been at the forefront of reform .
It was one of the early cities to emphasize public health approaches to addiction by making treatment more available and supporting needle exchange , methadone vans and harm reduction programs .
It has developed a strong public health infrastructure with programs treat addicts as humans rather than as criminals .
And , these programs make a tremendous positive difference for the person using drugs as well as the community he or she lives in .
They reduce the spread of HIV and reduce crime .
Seattle reform activist Dominic Holden writes about how Kerlikowske has handled needle exchange and harm reduction in Seattle :
‘ There has been long - standing support in the community as a whole and from SPD for our continued operation of the needle exchange , ’ says James Apa , a spokesman for Seattle King County Public Health , which runs one of first and the nation ’s largest needle - exchange programs .
Seattle IV drug users have some of the lowest HIV - infection rates in the country , he says .
But acceptance of the controversial program has n’t been that long standing .
’ What we would find is that police would hang around the exchange site and watch who came and went , ’ says Kris Nyrop , former director of Street Outreach Services , a pioneering needle exchange group that operated a table in downtown Seattle in the late 1980s .
‘ Their presence itself would be somewhat intimidating … people would see four police officers halfway down the block and they would turn around and go home , ’ he says .
‘ Harassment like that happened routinely up until the mid ’ 90s . ’
But under Kerlikowske , ‘ It has been a laissez - faire thing and the police basically leave needle exchanges alone , ’ says Nyrop .
Needle exchange is a public health program to prevent the spread of HIV that research has shown reduces transmission without increasing drug use .
It is part of what Europeans call “ harm reduction , ” i.e. reducing the harm caused by drugs to the individual and community .
It is something that has been opposed by the U.S. drug enforcement bureaucracy .
In addition , Kerlikowske replaced enforcement with public services and alternatives to arrest .
One program his department implemented was the Get Off The Streets ( GOTS ) program .
A police officer set up a table as an “ arrest - free area ” for people who had outstanding warrants .
They could come to the table and get health and human services rather than be arrested .
City Council Member Nick Lacata says that Kerlikowske could have stopped the program from getting funding by the city , “ but he allowed it to go forward . ”
Licata says that while Kerlikowske is not going to end the drug war but “ he recognizes that it has not been a success and I think he is open to other strategies . ”
During Chief Kerlikowske ’s tenure as police chief Seattle voted in favor of Initiative 75 in 2003 which made marijuana the lowest law enforcement priority .
The public sent a message with their vote that they did not want limited law enforcement resources spent on marijuana offenses .
Chief Kerlikowske did not support I75 but when this law passed his administration implemented the law .
The Seattle Police told a City Council Marijuana Policy Review Panel that “ officers [ had ] been verbally advised during their roll calls that investigation and arrest of adults for possession of cannabis intended for personal use is to be their lowest priority . ”
The result , the city reduced marijuana possession arrests by more than half in six years and redirected law enforcement resources to real crime .
Seattle ’s crime rate is now at a historical 40 - year low .
Kerlikowske worked closely with the organizers of the Seattle Hempfest – the largest marijuana reform gathering in the nation .
More than 200,000 people attend the annual event .
The Seattle Police essentially allowed the organizers to police themselves .
They kept a very low key presence at the event and did not seek out marijuana consumers at the festival for arrest .
One common denominator of previous drug czar ’s is they all made marijuana the top priority of their attention .
The current drug czar , John Walters , wrote U.S. attorneys “ [ N ] o drug matches the threat posed by marijuana ” reflecting the views of Democrats and Republicans .
Indeed , looking at the history of drug czar ’s — really a rogue ’s gallery including right wing social conservatives like Bill Bennett ( who hid his gambling addiction while punishing other addicts ) and extreme militarist Barry McCaffery ( accused of war crimes in the first Gulf War ) — Kerlikowske could be the superstar of drug czars .
If he personally holds views consistent with his experience in Seattle the U.S. may actually begin to solve the seemingly unsolvable drug issue .
It would be a welcome change to have a pragmatist rather than an ideologue in charge of drug policy .
Kerlikowske , a 36 year police veteran , is a tough police chief who is widely respected and widely criticized .
When appointed by Obama he was serving as president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association , an organization composed of 56 largest law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and has been a chief in three previous cities in New York and Florida .
He has been extremely aggressive with environmental and anti-corporate trade demonstrators some say violating their free speech rights .
He has also used the forfeiture power of police aggressively and has been proud of para - military units in his police force .
And , his force – like too many in the United States – has been criticized for abuse of African Americans .
The marijuana issue and drug war more generally have gotten a lot of attention lately , particularly the battlefronts of Mexico and Afghanistan .
There is debate in the media about legalization and decriminalization , especially of marijuana .
So , Kerlikowske takes the helm at a time of potential change to more sensible policies .
We ’ll see whether pragmatism , ideology or the long - term habit of “ drug war ” politics wins out .
The Basics

- Xms and - Xmx set the minimum and maximum sizes for the heap .
Touted as a feature , Hotspot puts a cap on heap size to prevent it from blowing out your system .
So once you figure out the max memory your app needs , you cap it to keep rogue code from impacting other apps .
Use these flags like - Xmx512M , where the M stands for MB .
If you do n't include it , you 're specifying bytes .
Several flags use this format .
You can also get a minor startup perf boost by setting minimum higher , since it does n't have to grow the heap right away .

- Xshare : dump can help improve startup performance on some installations .
When run as root ( or whatever user you have the JVM installed as ) it will dump a shared - memory file to disk containing all of the core class data .
This file is much faster to load then re-verifying and re-loading all the individual classes , and once in memory it 's shared by all JVMs on the system .
Note that - Xshare : off , - Xshare : on , - Xshare : auto set whether " Class Data Sharing " is enabled , and it's not available on the - server VM or on 64 - bit systems .
Mac users : you 're already using Apple 's version of this feature , upon which Hotspot 's version is based .
-verbose : gc logs garbage collector runs and how long they 're taking .
I generally use this as my first tool to investigate if GC is a bottleneck for a given application .

I 've had Hotspot engineers recommend I " do n't use this " but I still think it 's a decent ( albeit very blunt ) tool for finding bottlenecks .
Just do n't use the results as anything more than a guide .

- Xrunhprof turns on a higher - impact instrumenting profiler .
The default invocation with no extra parameters records object allocations and high - allocation sites , which is useful for finding excess object creation .
- Xrunhprof : cpu=times instruments all Java code in the JVM and records the actual CPU time calls take .
I generally only use this to profile JRuby internals because it 's extremely slow , but it's also much more accurate than - Xprof .
Deeper Magic
-XX : +UseParallelGC turns on the parallel young - generation garbage collector .
This is a stop - the - world collector that uses several threads to reduce pause times .
There 's also -XX : +UseParallelOldGC
to use a parallel collector for the old generation , but it 's generally only useful if you often have large numbers of old objects getting collected .

There 's also to use a parallel collector for the old generation , but it 's generally only useful if you often have large numbers of old objects getting collected .
-XX :+UseConcMarkSweepGC turns on the concurrent mark - sweep collector .
This one runs most GC operations in parallel to your application 's execution , reducing pauses significantly .
It still stops the world for its compact phase , but that 's usually quicker than pausing for the whole set of GC operations .
This is useful if you need to reduce the impact GC has on an application run and do n't mind that it's a little slower than the full stop - the - world versions .
Also , you obviously would need multiple processors to see full effect .
( Incidentally , if you 're interested in GC tuning , you should look at Java SE 6 HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning .
There 's a lot more there . )

The defaults are 1:12 in the - client VM and 1:8 in the - server VM .
You often want a higher ratio if you have a lot more transient data flowing through your application than long - lived data .
For example , Ruby 's high object churn often means a lower NewRatio ( i.e. larger " new " versus " old " ) helps performance , since it prevents transient objects from getting promoted to old generations .

-XX : MaxPermSize= ###M sets the maximum " permanent generation " size .
Hotspot is unusual in that several types of data get stored in the " permanent generation " , a separate area of the heap that is only rarely ( or never ) garbage - collected .
The list of perm - gen hosted data is a little fuzzy , but it generally contains things like class metadata , bytecode , interned strings , and so on ( and this certainly varies across Hotspot versions ) .
Because this generation is rarely or never collected , you may need to increase its size ( or turn on perm - gen sweeping with a couple other flags ) .
In JRuby especially we generate a lot of adapter bytecode , which usually demands more perm gen space .
-XX : +PrintCompilation prints out the name of each Java method Hotspot decides to JIT compile .
The list will usually show a bunch of core Java class methods initially , and then turn to methods in your application .
In JRuby , it eventually starts to show Ruby methods as well .

Into The Belly
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
- XX : MaxInlineSize= # sets the maximum size method Hotspot will consider for inlining .
By default it 's set at 35 * bytes * of bytecode ( i.e. pretty small ) .
This is largely why Hotspot really like lots of small methods ; it can then decide the best way to inline them based on runtime profiling .
You can bump it up , and sometimes it will produce better performance , but at some point the compilation units get large enough that many of Hotspot 's optimizations are skipped .
Fun to play with though .

- XX : +LogCompilation is like - XX : +PrintCompilation on steroids .
It not only prints out methods that are being JITed , it also prints out why methods may be deoptimized ( like if new code is loaded or a new call target is discovered ) and information about which methods are being inlined .
There 's a caveat though : the output is seriously nasty XML without any real structure to it .
I use a Sun-internal tool for rendering it in a nicer format , which I 'm trying to get open - sourced .
Hopefully that will happen soon .
Note , this option requires -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions .
-XX : +PrintOptoAssembly dumps to the console a log of all assembly being generated for JITed methods .
The instructions are basically x86 assembly with a few Hotspot - specific instruction names that get replaced with hardware - specific instructions during the final assembly phase .
In addition to the JITed assembly , this flag also shows how registers are being allocated , the probability of various branches being followed ( along with multiple assembly blocks for the different paths ) , and information about calls back into the JVM .
Outside the logging options for the final generated assembly ( which requires a separate plugin ) this is the best tool for discovering what optimizations are actually happening .
I use this at least a couple times a week to investigate JRuby performance enhancements .
And So Much More
-J-XX : +PrintCompilation
Update :
Marcus Kohler commented on - XX : +HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError , useful if you have a slow - leaking application you can't pin down .
It will dump heap information to disk whenever there 's an OutOfMemoryError , allowing you to do offline analysis .

as a way to send out email when there 's an OutOfMemoryError .
Poor - man 's monitoring !
I also remembered a very important option for JRuby : - Xbootclasspath specifies classpath entries you want loaded without verification .
The JVM verifies all classes it loads to ensure they do n't try to dereference an object with an int , pop extra entries off the stack or push too many , and so on .
This verification is part of the reason why the JVM is very stable , but it's also rather costly , and responsible for a large part of startup delay .
Putting classes on the bootclasspath skips this cost , but should only be used when you know the classes have been verified many times before .
In JRuby , this reduced startup time by half or more for a simple script .
Use - Xbootclasspath / a : and - Xbootclasspath / p : to append and prepend to the default bootclasspath or - Xbootclasspath : to completely set your own .
I probably start up a JVM a thousand times a day .
Test runs , benchmark runs , bug confirmation , API exploration , or running actual apps .
And in many of these runs , I use various JVM switches to tweak performance or investigate runtime metrics .
Here 's a short list of my favorite JVM switches ( note these are Hotspot / OpenJDK / SunJDK switches , and may or may not work on yours .
Apple JVM is basically the same , so these work ) .
Most runs will want to tweak a few simple flags :
There are also some basic flags for logging runtime information :
Eventually you may want to tweak deeper details of the JVM :
And there are a few more advanced logging and profiling options as well :
Finally here 's a list of the deepest options we use to investigate performance .
Some of these require a debug build of the JVM , which you can download from java .
net Also , some of these may require you also passto enable them .

While many of the young animals featured on ZooBorns are orphans and keepers must step in , many more have doting natural mothers like baby giraffe calf " Margaret Abigail , " photographed earlier this week with mom at the Bronx Zoo .
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY ’S BRONX ZOO : ANNOUNCES DEBUT OF BABY GIRAFFE
Mother ’s Day Baby Boom at the Bronx Zoo
Bronx , NY – May 6 , 2009 -- The Wildlife Conservation Society ’s Bronx Zoo is thrilled to announce the public debut of a baby giraffe – who is proving to have a very active and playful personality .
The calf , named Margaret Abigail , can be seen at the Bronx Zoo ’s African Plains exhibit .
She lives in a herd of five other females , and one male .
The calf ’s parents are a young adult cow , Margaret Sukari , and an adult bull named James Michael .
“ We are pleased to be debuting several notable baby animals , making the Bronx Zoo a very special place to visit this spring , ” said Jim Breheny , Director of WCS ’s Bronx Zoo .
“ Our zoo visitors can expect a few more baby births in the coming weeks . ”
Margaret Abigail was born February 17 , 2008 and weighed between 100 and 150 pounds .
She measured approximately about five - and - a - half to six feet tall .
The average giraffe can grow to more than 16 feet from the ground to the top of its horns .
Adult giraffes average about 1,800 pounds , but especially large males can way as much as 4,000 pounds .
Margaret Abigail ’s birth is the result of the Wildlife Conservation Society ’s breeding program ; the zoo ’s last giraffe calf birth was approximately two - and - a - half years ago .
Giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands across much of sub-Saharan Africa .
Their African Plains habitat at WCS ’ Bronx Zoo , recreates that savanna .
The African Plains exhibit opened in 1941 , as one of the nation ’s first open range , multispecies habitats .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Credit protection costs for Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.NBRKb.N on Friday traded at a level more appropriate for a borderline " junk " - rated company or emerging market nations such as Turkey or Peru after Berkshire lost its " AAA " credit rating .

Fitch Ratings late Thursday downgraded Berkshire ’s rating to “ AA - plus ” from “ AAA , ” and its senior unsecured debt rating to “ AA ” from “ AAA . ”
Its outlook is “ negative , ” meaning another cut is possible within a couple of years .
The rating agency said Berkshire ’s equity and derivatives holdings leave the Omaha , Nebraska - based company ’s earnings stream and capital volatility “ inconsistent with the stability required at the ‘ AAA ’ level . ”
Fitch also said its downgrade reflects so - called “ key man ” risk , in that Berkshire ’s track record and ability to find companies to buy is “ intimately tied ” to Buffett .
It said this risk factor has grown larger in the “ current stressful economic environment ” and is unrelated to Buffett ’s age , 78 .
Standard &
Poor ’s would have cause to give Berkshire a negative outlook if the company ’s capital position continued weakening this year and if S&P thought Buffett ’s firm would be unable to rebuild its capital through earnings , an analyst for the rating agency said .
“ Warren Buffett has been there for a long time , so the concentration of risk from that is not a new issue for us , ” said S&P analyst Damien Magarelli , addressing the “ key man ” issue .
Berkshire did return a telephone call seeking comment on Fitch ’s action , and Moody ’s did not respond to an inquiry on what action it might take regarding Berkshire ’s rating .
Five - year credit default swaps for Berkshire fell on Friday to 417 basis points , or $ 417,000 a year to protect $ 10 million of debt , from 438 basis points at Thursday ’s close , according to data from CMA DataVision .
The lower cost reflected market optimism that the rating cut did not go beyond one notch .
It nevertheless suggests that Berkshire ’s credit risk is close to that of emerging market nations such as Peru , Turkey and Colombia , which trade between 421 and 452 basis points , according to Markit Intraday .
Berkshire lost its " AAA " rating from Fitch the same day that S&P took away General Electric Co's GE.N equivalent rating .
Berkshire is a major GE investor .
Separately , Berkshire in a regulatory filing said Buffett was awarded about $ 491,000 of compensation in 2008 , including a $ 100,000 salary , $ 75,000 of director fees , and $ 315,709 of personal and home security services .
Buffett 's salary has been unchanged for more than a quarter century .
Buffett this week lost his position as the world 's richest person to Microsoft Corp MSFT .
O co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates , according to Forbes magazine .
Buffett is worth $ 37 billion , the magazine said .
In afternoon trading , Berkshire Class A shares were down $ 2,150 , or 2.5 percent , at $ 83.550 .
The Letters of Samuel Beckett , Volume 1 : 1929 –1940 edited by Martha Dow Fehsenfeld and Lois More Overbeck Cambridge University Press , 782 pp. , $ 50.00
1 .
In 1923 Samuel Barclay Beckett , aged seventeen , was admitted to Trinity College , Dublin , to study Romance languages .
He proved an exceptional student , and was taken under the wing of Thomas Rudmose - Brown , professor of French , who did all he could to advance the young man ’s career , securing for him on graduation first a visiting lectureship at the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris , then a position back at Trinity College .
After a year and a half at Trinity , performing what he called the “ grotesque comedy of lecturing , ” Beckett resigned and fled back to Paris .
Yet even after this letdown , Rudmose - Brown did not give up on his protégé .
As late as 1937 he was still trying to nudge Beckett back into the academy , persuading him to apply for a lectureship in Italian at the University of Cape Town .
“ I may say without exaggeration , ” he wrote in a supporting letter , “ that as well as possessing a sound academic knowledge of the Italian , French and German languages , [ Mr Beckett ] has remarkable creative faculty . ”
In a postscript he added : “ Mr Beckett has an adequate knowledge of Provençal , ancient and modern . ”
Beckett felt genuine fondness and respect for Rudmose - Brown , a Racine specialist with an interest in the contemporary French literary scene .
Beckett ’s first book , a monograph on Proust ( 1931 ) , though commissioned as a general introduction to this challenging new writer , reads more like an essay by a superior graduate student intent on impressing his professor .
Beckett himself had severe doubts about the book .
Rereading it , he “ wondered what [ he ] was talking about , ” as he confided to his friend Thomas McGreevy .
It seemed to be “ a distorted steam - rolled equivalent of some aspect or confusion of aspects of myself … tied somehow on to Proust … .
Not that I care .
I do n’t want to be a professor . ”
What dismayed Beckett most about professorial life was teaching .
Day after day this shy , taciturn young man had to confront in the classroom the sons and daughters of Ireland ’s Protestant middle class , and persuade them that Ronsard and Stendhal were worthy of their attention .
“ He was a very impersonal lecturer , ” reminisced one of his better students .
“ He said what he had to say and then left the lecture room … .
I believe he considered himself a bad lecturer and that makes me sad because he was so good … .
Many of his students would , unfortunately , agree with him . ”
“ The thought of teaching again paralyses me , ” Beckett wrote to McGreevy from Trinity in 1931 as a new term approached .
“ I think I will go to Hamburg as soon as I get my Easter cheque …and perhaps hope for the courage to break away . ”
It took another year before he found that courage .
“ Of course I ’ll probably crawl back with my tail coiled round my ruined poenis [ sic ] , ” he wrote to McGreevy .
“ And maybe I wont . ”

According to a London Times report , U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will probably be in attendance at this week ’s Bilderberg Group meeting , as top globalists meet to plot the financial future of the planet behind closed doors .
The Times article notes that “ US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner ’s public schedule is mysteriously empty for the next two days , ” speculating that he will be in Vouliagmeni , Greece for the annual elitist confab , following in the footsteps of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who attended last year ’s conference in Washington DC just months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of the economic crisis .
Geithner , who has overseen Obama ’s bailout agenda since taking over from Hank Paulson , is the perfect stooge to implement the global financial regulatory systems that elitists have called for in the aftermath of the financial downturn .
Back in March , Geithner publicly stated that there were no plans to move towards a global currency to supplant the dollar , and yet at a private CFR meeting he assured his fellow globalists that he was “ open ” to the notion of a new global currency system .
Geithner ’s presence at Bilderberg is noteworthy , not only because Bernanke attended immediately before the economic crisis last year , but also because Bilderberg ’s agenda for 2009 is heavily weighted towards the financial crisis .
According to a pre-meeting booklet handed out to members that was leaked to investigative journalist Daniel Estulin , “ Bilderberg is divided on whether to put into motion , “ Either a prolonged , agonizing depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation , decline and poverty … or an intense - but - shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order , with less sovereignty but more efficiency . ”
[ efoods ]
The Times also reports that World Bank President Robert Zoellick , “ Will be in Athens on unspecified business on May 14 , ” meaning it ’s almost certain that he too will attend Bilderberg , as numerous past World Bank chiefs have done in previous years .
During a speech which preceded this year ’s G8 summit , Zoellick openly admitted Bilderberg ’s plan to eliminate national sovereignty and impose a global government via the imposition of worldwide financial regulatory powers .
Speaking about the agenda to increase not just funding but power for international organizations on the back of the financial crisis , Zoellick stated , “ If leaders are serious about creating new global responsibilities or governance , let them start by modernising multilateralism to empower the WTO , the IMF , and the World Bank Group to monitor national policies . ”
“ To say we were striving for a one - world government is exaggerated , but not wholly unfair , ” top Bilderberg member Lord Healey once told author Jon Ronson , adding that Bilderberg members thought “ A single community throughout the world would be a good thing . ”
As we have previously highlighted , the European Union was a creation of Bilderberg founding members , aided by top Nazi economists such as Hermann Abs , Hitler ’s top banker and a man described by Bilderberg luminary David Rockefeller as “ the greatest banker of the 20th century ” .
In addition to Geithner ’s probable attendance , US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg is using the pretext of an obscure meeting with Greek officials , the first time a member of the Obama administration has done so , to take his place at Bilderberg .
According to Greek newspaper Kathimerini , “ Steinberg will be in Athens for a meeting of the international invitation - only club , the Bilderberg Group , which begins today and runs until Saturday . ”

At General Motors , executives are fighting to save a company that has cut their salaries and suspended their vacations .
On Wall Street , professionals are demonized and then asked to work overtime to repair the damage colleagues have wrought .
These professionals may not deserve tears , particularly compared to the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and their homes .
But Mr. Kellermann ’s death is a reminder that those suffering in this crisis reside in every neighborhood , from the squalid to the opulent .
Image Police on Wednesday outside the Vienna , Va. , home where David B. Kellermann , the acting chief financial officer of Freddie Mac , was found dead .

“ The pressure right now is relentless , ” said a Freddie Mac executive who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak .
“ Everyone in the financial sector , regardless of where you work , is constantly told both that this is our fault , and that we have to work as hard as possible , otherwise the nation will fall apart . ”
Mr. Kellermann , who spent more than 16 years at Freddie Mac and saw his stock and options decline precipitously last year , was at the intersection of some of the most difficult issues facing the company .
Last month the company ’s chief executive , David M. Moffett , resigned in part , he said , because federal regulators were using Freddie Mac to carry out economic policy at the expense of nursing the publicly held company back to financial health .
The company has not had a president since 2007 .
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , which together own or back more than half of the home mortgages in the country , have been hobbled by skyrocketing loan defaults and have received a total of $ 60 billion in federal aid since they were taken over last fall .
Mr. Kellermann was also working in a poisonous political atmosphere .
In addition to taking criticism over the bonuses , he was recently involved in tense conversations with the company ’s federal regulator over its routine financial disclosures , according to people close to those discussions who also spoke on condition of anonymity .
Freddie Mac executives wanted to emphasize to investors that they believed the company was being run to benefit the government , rather than shareholders .
The company ’s regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Authority , had pushed to play down that language .
Freddie Mac reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that changes it had made in practices to help the government “ have increased our expenses or caused us to forgo revenue opportunities . ”
Mr. Kellermann was also required to certify Freddie Mac ’s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The company disclosed in March that there was a continuing federal investigation of its accounting , disclosure and corporate governance practices .
That investigation is currently being overseen by the United States attorney ’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia , which declined to comment .
A spokesman , David Palombi , said Freddie Mac knew of no link between the death and the legal inquiries .
A spokeswoman for the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia said there were no signs of foul play in Mr. Kellermann ’s death .
The police would not comment on whether a note had been found , but a spokesman said that nothing except the body had been removed from the house .
Here are two of Hayek 's greatest essays in one small and beautiful volume at a very low price .
It is a perfect way to introduce yourself and others to this giant of the 20th century .
The book begins with Hayek 's most excellent essay on money .
It is also his most radical .
He plainly says that central banks cannot be reformed .
There can never be sound money so long as they are in charge .
He calls for their complete abolition , no compromises accepted .
He wants the market in charge of money from top to bottom .
His words predicting crisis followed by wild swings in valuation are up to the minute .
He also relates the quality of money with the recurrence of crisis , showing an excellent application of Austrian theory .
Hayek was deeply influenced by Mises , and this shows here in the area of money .
The second essay is " The Pretense of Knowledge , " his shocking Nobel speech that explained why the very idea of government in our times is unintellectual , presumptuous , and untenable .
He is as critical of socialism as he is of interventionism .
He shows that the state is not capable of doing all that it is charged with doing , and why conceding it any role in social and economic management is dangerous to liberty .
It was not the speech everyone expected .
But it lived up to Hayek 's lifelong commitment to telling truth to power .
This small book , just right for sticking in your back pocket or purse , is really a first in the Hayekian literature : small form , powerful words , and by the great man himself .

A mother from the United States gave birth to twins who were found to have different fathers .
After undergoing DNA tests , Mia Washington from Dallas , Texas , made everything clear by admitting that she was dating another man when she conceived , thus two eggs were fertilized by the sperm of two men .
Together with her partner , the woman decide to undergo DNA tests at Dallas DNA Lab Clear Diagnostics after noticing that the twins have different facial features .
" Out of all people in America and of all people in the world , it had to happen to me .
I 'm very shocked , " Miss Washington said .
The paternity test showed that there is a 99.999 percent chance that the 11 - moth - old twins , named Justin and Jordan have different fathers .
According to specialists from the lab , it is for the first time that they receive such a result and they are less likely to see it again .
" It is very crazy .
Most people do n't believe it can happen , but it can , " said Clear Diagnostics President Genny Thibodeaux .
Only a few similar cases were documented around the globe .
The doctors call this condition heteropaternal superfecundation .
According to Dr Chris Dreiling , twins from different fathers is a condition that can occur if the conception takes places when mother lets go of multiple eggs during ovulation .
In case a woman had more than one sexual partner during the same period of ovulation , sperm cells are able to fertilize two separate eggs .
The father of the two babies said he has forgiven his finance and decided to be with her and raise the twins together .
The woman mentioned that as soon as the babies grow old enough to understand , she will tell them the truth about why they have different DNA .
At the same time she has no intention of telling the truth to the other biological father .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Mohammed Ismail was released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in early 2004 and sent back to Afghanistan to be set free .
A guard talks with a detainee at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , earlier this year .
Within four months , the U.S. military said , he was recaptured in Afghanistan attacking U.S. troops there , with paperwork on him that said he was a Taliban in good standing .
He is just one of 74 former Guantanamo Bay detainees who the military says were active in , or were suspected of being active in , fighting against the United States or committing terrorist acts after being released .
Another is Abdullah Gulam Rasoul , who was released from Guantanamo in December 2007 and set free in Afghanistan .
Rasoul has become a powerful Taliban military commander in southern Afghanistan , the military said , and the United States suspects he is responsible for several attacks on U.S. forces there .
A senior U.S. military official said he believes Rasoul is using his former Guantanamo experience to build on his " rock star status " among the Taliban .
Abd al Hadi Abdallah Ibrahim al Shaikh of Saudi Arabia , who was released in 2007 , was arrested in 2008 by Saudi authorities on suspicion of supporting terrorism inside that country , the military said .
On Tuesday , the Pentagon released information that showed 14 percent of former detainees have turned to , or are suspected of having turned to , terrorism activity since being released from Guantanamo .
The data represent the most recent statistics of former detainees tracked by military and other U.S. government intelligence agencies .
The report shows that of the more than 530 detainees released from the prison , 27 have been confirmed to have engaged in terrorist activities and 47 are suspected of participating in some kind of terrorist act .
The statistics indicate that there has been a slight increase since the end of 2008 , and the number of released detainees turning to or suspected of turning to the insurgency is almost doubled from the 7 percent in that category a few years ago , according to Pentagon officials familiar with the information .
The report said that between December 2008 and March 2009 , nine former detainees were added to the confirmed list , six of whom were moved over from the suspected list .
The Pentagon 's definition for " suspected " is significant reporting indicating a person is involved in terrorist activities and an analysis showing a match to an identity of a former detainee .
The report defines " confirmed " as a preponderance of evidence , including fingerprints , DNA , photo match or reliable or well - corroborated intelligence that can identify a former detainee at Guantanamo .
In January , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said 62 former Guantanamo detainees may have gone on to participate in terrorism or military activity .
That number included 18 who had been directly tied to an attack or attacks and 43 who were suspected of such action , Pentagon officials said at the time .
" What 's clear is we are not seeing recidivism on the decline , " according to a defense official who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to say what officials think is the reason for the numbers having gone up , but said the United States does monitor as best as it can detainees who have been released from Guantanamo .
The Pentagon released the names of almost 30 former detainees confirmed or suspected to have gone on to fight , with examples of what these men had done after their release .
Abdullah Saleh Ali al - Ajmi , for example , was released in 2005 to Kuwait .
In April 2008 he blew himself up in Mosul , Iraq , killing a number of Iraqis , the Pentagon said .
Yousef Muhammed Yaaqoub was released from Guantanamo and sent back to Afghanistan to be freed in 2003 .
The Pentagon documents show that he rejoined the Taliban as a commander in southern Afghanistan , and planned a jailbreak in Kandahar and a " nearly successful capture of the town of Spin Boldak , Afghanistan . "
Yaaqoub was killed fighting U.S. troops on May 7 , 2004 , according to the Pentagon data , and his memorial service in Pakistan drew a number of wanted Taliban leaders .
Other examples released by the Pentagon show men sent home to Morocco who were later captured and accused of recruiting people to train with and fight for al Qaeda in Iraq , two men freed in Saudi Arabia who became leaders in a new al Qaeda organization there , and a Russian sent home who later was arrested for playing a role in a gas line bombing .
As a comparison , among prisoners in the United States , about 62 percent of violent offenders examined in a 1994 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics were rearrested within three years of being released .

The U.S. Senate recount neared its final hours Thursday , buffeted by the kinds of disputes over missing ballots and challenged ballots that have become familiar in the month since the post-election drama began .
Yet at day 's end , with 99 percent of the ballots counted , the gap separating Republican Sen.
Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken was only 36 votes larger than it had been at the start .
Coleman now leads by 251 , according to Star Tribune tabulations .
As on Wednesday , the case of 133 missing ballots in Minneapolis held center stage .
The city 's top election official said she did not know where the ballots were , Franken 's campaign pressed for a " systematic forensic search " to find them , and Coleman 's lead recount attorney warned Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , a DFLer , to keep politics out of the controversy .
By day 's end , Ritchie 's office had given the city a waiver to keep its recount open while the search continued , and sent deputy Secretary of State Jim Gelbmann to assist in the hunt and serve as an official " witness " to the investigation .
The ballots , which were cast at a church in northeast Minneapolis , gained attention on Wednesday when the recount for the precinct tallied 133 ballots fewer than on Election Day .
Money , challenges Thursday also was marked by a flurry of other developments .
Franken 's campaign reported that it had raised $ 2.1 million for the recount , while Coleman 's camp has raised $ 1.8 million .
The Coleman campaign also announced that it was essentially matching Franken 's pledge on Wednesday to withdraw more than 600 ballot challenges made during the recount .
The state Canvassing Board is to meet on Dec. 16 to begin reviewing the thousands of remaining ballot challenges from the two campaigns .
The point of contention Thursday remained Minneapolis ' missing ballots .
Marc Elias , Franken 's lead recount attorney , urged state and local officials to " move heaven and earth " to find the ballots , and vaguely hinted that the campaign would take action to keep the recount from ending without including them .
The ballots , he said , were from a precinct near the University of Minnesota that included many first - time , and likely , many Franken voters .
" We will not stand for this .
The people of Minnesota will not stand for this -- find the ballots ! "
Elias said .
Coleman campaign officials said they were equally upset , charging that Franken wanted to subject the church that served as the polling place to a forensic search .
" We reject the notion that government or taxpayers should be required to conduct forensic searches of places of worship , " Fritz Knaak , Coleman 's lead recount attorney , said in a letter to Ritchie .
Coleman officials said they were miffed that a news conference Thursday in Minneapolis , called to discuss the missing ballots , included the Franken campaign , an official from the secretary of state 's office and Mayor R.T. Rybak , but no one from the Coleman campaign .
Not invited Knaak noted that those invited , including Rybak , are Democrats while those representing Coleman , a Republican , were not invited .
In a statement , Knaak asked that Ritchie 's office " refrain from any activity or action that can be perceived as partisan or supportive of [ Franken ] . "
If the 133 ballots are not found by the time the Canvassing Board meets on Dec. 16 , it will be up to board members to decide which vote total to accept from the precinct , Gelbmann said .
Minneapolis election officials examined voting documents and interviewed workers who were part of the chain of custody of the ballots , said Cindy Reichert , the city 's elections director .
" Now , the physical search begins again , " she said .
The ballots were in one of five envelopes that precinct judges delivered to the city 's warehouse early on the morning of Nov. 5 .
But when re-counters started their work , the envelope labeled " 1 " among the five was missing , Reichert said .
That has led officials to believe the ballots are still somewhere in the warehouse , she said .
" I 'm still hopeful that we 're going to find it in some odd place in our warehouse , " she added .
Reichert said she does n't believe the ballots are still at the church .
Tardy Texas lawyers in capital cases still paid thousands Death row lawyers get paid while messing up
Attorneys who continue to miss appeal dates are still getting cases
Texas lawyers have repeatedly missed deadlines for appeals on behalf of more than a dozen death row inmates in the last two years — yet judges continue to assign life - or - death capital cases and pay hundreds of thousands in fees to those attorneys , a Chronicle records review shows .
Missing deadlines means their clients can be automatically denied constitutionally mandated reviews before their execution .
Houston lawyer Jerome Godinich missed three recent federal deadlines , the Chronicle reported in March .
One client was executed in February after the federal appeal was filed too late .
In March , the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals chastened Godinich for using the same excuse — a malfunctioning after - hours filing machine — for missing another deadline for a man still on death row .
A recent review of the Harris County Auditor ’s billing records and district court records shows Godinich remains one of the county ’s busiest appointed criminal attorneys , billing for $ 713,248 , including fees for 21 capital cases .
He was appointed to handle 1,638 Harris County cases involving 1,400 different defendants from 2006 - March 2009 , court records show .
He refused comment .
Godinich is not the only attorney to miss death row deadlines .
A San Antonio lawyer failed to file four state appeals on time , according to opinions last year by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals .
A Fort Worth lawyer has missed both state and federal deadlines in at least five recent cases , though he sought and was granted more time to prepare on four of them , according to court records reviewed by the Chronicle .
The failure to file such appeals , called writs of habeas corpus , means death row inmates risk missing their last chance to submit new claims of innocence or evidence that could alter their conviction — or death sentence .
State judges can be flexible , but federal judges follow tight and sometimes confusing deadlines .
Only one of three Texas lawyers who repeatedly missed such death row deadlines has faced fines or been forced to forgo fees by judges .
Suzanne Kramer , of San Antonio , was removed in October 2008 from three state appeals she failed to file on time and was fined $ 750 by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals .
She is handling a fourth case over protests .
“ I know if this lawyer stays on my case I ’ll definitely get executed , ” death row inmate Juan Castillo wrote the Chronicle .
“ She ’s refused to respond to any of my letters … she ’s never come to see me to discuss my case ( and ) my writ was due Dec. 11 , 2006 and she never filed it . ”
Appeal filed incorrectly
The CCA allowed Kramer to continue representing Castillo after criticizing her claim that she mailed in his appeal on a Saturday to the office of a Bexar County judge .
The appeal was never filed with the county clerk , as required .
“ Judges do n’t file lawsuits .
I guess that would go on her credibility as a lawyer , ” said Gerry Rickhoff , district court clerk in Bexar County .
Kramer , who did not return phone calls to her office , has been paid $ 86,577 in fees by Bexar County since 2007 , but went unpaid for the three late appeals by CCA order .
Jack V. Strickland Jr. , a Fort Worth lawyer who specializes in capital case law , also has repeatedly missed death row deadlines .
However , judges accepted his explanations and allowed late filings for four of five appeals .
Being overwhelmed on capital cases was the excuse for two late 2008 filings .
Strickland told the court that he ’d been hospitalized several months before the appeals were due , then “ began a new death penalty trial right after his recuperation period , was in the process of preparing another death penalty writ application which was due mid-September , was preparing for trial in another case , and had presented five lectures and papers in the previous sixty days , ” according to a CCA opinion .
In another case , Strickland missed both state and then federal deadlines for the death row inmate , Quintin Jones .
Before losing his federal appeal due to lateness , Jones repeatedly tried to get another attorney .
Strickland said he “ almost begged the magistrate judge to appoint someone else .
Jones and I had a very unpleasant relationship . ”
He was left on the case anyway .
Strickland blamed the deadline error on miscalculating the due date .
He earned $ 428,850.62 in court - appointed fees in Tarrant County from 2006 - 2009 .
More than a quarter were bills for late appeals , auditor ’s records show .

In a guest post at Washington Note , Col. Lawrence Wilkerson blasts Dick Cheney for his torture lies .
My investigations have revealed to me-- vividly and clearly -- that once the Abu Ghraib photographs were made public in the Spring of 2004 , the CIA , its contractors , and everyone else involved in administering " the Cheney methods of interrogation " , simply shut down .
Nada .
Nothing .
No torture or harsh techniques were employed by any U.S. interrogator .
Period .
People were too frightened by what might happen to them if they continued .
What I am saying is that no torture or harsh interrogation techniques were employed by any U.S. interrogator for the entire second term of Cheney - Bush , 2005 - 2009 .
So , if we are to believe the protestations of Dick Cheney , that Obama 's having shut down the " Cheney interrogation methods " will endanger the nation , what are we to say to Dick Cheney for having endangered the nation for the last four years of his vice presidency ?
Likewise , what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002 -- well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion -- its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al - Qa'ida .
So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee , even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney 's office that their detainee " was compliant " ( meaning the team recommended no more torture ) , the VP 's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods .
The detainee had not revealed any al - Qa'ida - Baghdad contacts yet .
This ceased only after Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , under waterboarding in Egypt , " revealed " such contacts .
Of course later we learned that al - Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop .
There in fact were no such contacts .
( Incidentally , al - Libi just " committed suicide " in Libya .
Interestingly , several U.S. lawyers working with tortured detainees were attempting to get the Libyan government to allow them to interview al - Libi .... )
A great looking portfolio site is crucial for any designer to instantly present their work to potential clients or employers .
A simple , single page site can do this effectively by displaying three key features of large header with short introduction , examples of your work and methods of contact all in one , extremely browsable page .
Let ’s take a look at producing a single page portfolio concept in Photoshop , constructing the page in XHTML / CSS and adding some fancy functionality with jQuery .
Last month , I had the pleasure of writing an article for internationally renown NET Magazine , also known as Practical Web Design in the US .
The article titled Create Your Own Single Page Portfolio Site with XHTML / CSS and jQuery appeared in issue 188 .
The folks over at NET magazine have kindly allowed the article to be republished here on Blog .
SpoonGraphics for those who might have missed it .
I highly recommend checking out the new issues of NET magazine , and to catch them on Twitter for some handy web design tips and tecniques .
Your online portfolio is your place to introduce yourself to the world and showcase your work and skillset .
Once upon a time the traditional leather slipcase was the standard form of showing employers and clients what you can do , nowadays a personal website is your main selling point .
Sure , you could use websites such as Flickr , DeviantArt or similar to produce a quick and easy collection of work , but we ’re wanting to look professional here , and nothing beats your own hand crafted site sitting pretty under your personalised .com domain name .
What we ’re looking to achieve , is to build a simple website that compiles the important information of who you are , what you do , examples of your work and methods of contact .
These are the key points anyone looking to hire a designer will need .
The site also needs to look nice , but not to be too in - your - face that it takes the limelight from the examples of your work , so we ’ll build a clean , structured layout with subtle details .
Finally , we also want the site to keep the attention of the viewer , if your website is part of a bunch of job applications we do n’t want to allow the viewer to lose interest clicking through page after page .
Limiting the site to a single page helps display all the information quickly and effectively .
Let ’s get started with the Photoshop mockup , then move onto the nitty gritty of coding up with XHTML / CSS , and finish off with some fancy features using an awesome jQuery plugin .
Prepare The Document
Start work by opening Adobe Photoshop , create a new document at 1680x1050 px .
Draw in guides to highlight a 960 px wide area to accommodate 1024×768 resolution monitors .
We do n’t want any major page elements straying beyond this point .
Also draw out a basic grid to align the page elements to , giving a nice , structured appearance .
Add Some Texture
Fill the document with a soft beige colour , then go to Filter > Noise > Add Noise .
Enter 3 % and check the Monochromatic option .
Paste in a concrete texture from Bittbox.com .
Fade out the edges with a layer mask and soft brush , then change to the Overlay blending mode at 40 % opacity .
Introduce Yourself
Using the grid as a guide , type out your name and a brief introduction of your services in your favourite typeface .
Add a very soft Drop Shadow and change the blending mode to Overlay .
Emphasise the visual hierarchy by making the name stand out with a larger size and stronger appearance .
Present The Goods
Pick out a small selection of your work and crop them down to thumbnails at 400x180 px .
Add a 10 px stroke at 10 % opacity to blend them into the design .
Pay particular attention to their alignment to each other , making sure the horizontal and vertical gap between each image is the same .
Methods of Contact
After the viewer has browsed your selection of work , they may want to get in touch or connect .
List out your email alongside your main social networks , such as Twitter and Facebook .
Use the doodle icons from a previous post here on Blog.
SpoonGraphics.co.uk to spice up the links .
Add a Color Overlay to blend these into the site colour scheme .
The Overall Concept
Here we have our graphical concept for our website , laid out exactly how we plan it to look .
There ’s a subtle texture to the design to add some visual interest , a basic colour scheme based around our branding , a selection of our work and a list of methods of contact .
Time to take a well deserved break .
Export the Background
Our concept uses the large area of stone texture as part of the design , toggle the visibility of all the other layers and copy a large section of the graphic .
Save for Web and tweak the compression to find a happy medium between file size and image quality .
Export the Page Elements
Continue cutting up the document and exporting the individual files .
Due to the cool typeface and effects used on the text , we ’ll have to export these as images also .
However you could always sacrifice small design features in favour of web safe font styling , or even technologies such as SiFR .
Optimise Using Sprites
When it comes to exporting the icons , we can combine these files into a single sprite graphic .
Copy each icon in turn and stack them on top of each other in a new document , then Save for Web .
This reduces what would have been 7 image requests into 1 , for a speedier page load .
Write Up the XHTML
Start work writing up the XHTML in a coding application of your choice .
Pay attention to using the most natural HTML tags for each page element , such as H1 tag for the largest title , H2 for the smaller headings and UL for the lists of portfolio images and methods of contact .
Style it Up with CSS
With the relevant HTML tags in place , CSS styling can be added to change the appearance of the code .
Begin with a reset to remove any browser specific or default styling .
The repeating texture can be attached to the BODY , while the larger background can be used along with a page - wrap DIV .
Lay Out the Page Structure
Style the container div with a specific width and add margin : 0 auto ; to align the div centrally on the page .
The headings can also be styled using the background - image property .
Do n’t forget to shift the default text off - screen using - 9999 px .
This is a commonly used CSS image replacement technique .
Float The Thumbnails
By default an unordered list will display vertically with ugly bullet points , but the good old UL can be extremely versatile with the help of CSS .
Float the portfolio thumbnails to the left to lay them out side by side , then add some padding and margin to space them out just like the concept .
Put the Sprite Into Action
The image sprite we produced earlier can be implemented with CSS .
Style the #footer ul li a with any generic options such as margin , padding , color and font - size , as well as adding the contact - icons. jpg background - image and setting to no-repeat .
Then for each individual anchor class , target the appropriate icon using the background - position rule .
Spicing Up With jQuery
By default the image links for the portfolio will simply open in the browser , but that ’s boring !
With the use of some awesome , ready made plugins along with the jQuery framework we can easily add some great looking effects .
Download the jQuery Lightbox package from Leandrovieira.com .
Copy The Files
The jQuery lightbox downloads as a complete example , pick out the files we need and copy them to your own project folder .
We need jquery.js , jquery.lightbox-0.5.js , jquery.lightbox-0.5.css and the 5 image files .
Link up the Javascript and CSS files in the HEAD of your HTML document .
Then , write the jQuery script to target the portfolio links .
The Completed Website
With the jQuery functionality in place our website should be looking spot on .
We have a simple one page site , with short introductory sentence , a collection of work examples that launch with a stunning animated effect and a range of contact portals .
Our website is complete , or is it ?…
Browser Testing
It ’s crucial to check our site in a range of everyday browsers .
Our valid code might look great in Firefox , Safari , Chrome and Opera but Internet Explorer can sometimes display rather strange issues .
IE7 seems fine , but IE6 is showing the typical ‘ stepdown ’ bug on the footer links .
Display : inline to the LI soon sorts that !
Time to Launch
With the peace of mind of a correctly displaying site in various resolutions and browsers we can go ahead and place our freshly baked website live for the world to see .

LANGLEY PARK , Md.  Class at the youth center had just let out , and a gaggle of teenagers moved toward the door , turning saggy pants and ring tones thrumming with reggaetón hits into adolescent statements of Latino cool .
Some had rap sheets , and some had babies .
Some had gang tattoos .
Most had immigrant parents with menial jobs who survived on sweat and worry .
They were children of the Washington suburbs , but the poverty and violence around them rivaled that of urban cores .
Jesselyn Bercian paused to rub the belly of a pregnant staff member .
“ I ’m not very happy with my job right now , ” Jesselyn told her .
An American - born daughter of Salvadoran immigrants , Jesselyn was 19 years old with a smooth face and a friendly air ; her MySpace name was Gigglez .
But she had an eighth - grade education , a gang history and an ex-boyfriend in prison for murder .
Off the streets though not free of them , she was studying for a high school equivalency diploma and working at the mall .
“ My boss is always complaining about me , ” she said .
The staff member , Nancy Morning , recognized the affliction : teenager with attitude .
“ You ’re not doing what you ’re supposed to be doing , ” she said .
An American soldier killed five of his fellow troops at a base in Baghdad , the Pentagon said today .
The five were killed in a shooting 2 pm local time , at Camp Liberty near Baghdad international airport .
An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths is underway .
The toll was the highest for US personnel in a single attack since April 10 , when a suicide truck driver killed five American soldiers with a blast near a police headquarters in the northern city of Mosul .
In a separate incident , a US soldier was killed yesterday when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle in Basra province of southern Baghdad .
Earlier this month , two US soldiers were killed by a man wearing an Iraqi army uniform at an Iraqi military training centre in northern Iraq .
Violence has dropped sharply in Iraq , but insurgent attacks continue , and a rash of big bombings has raised questions about security less than two months before US forces are due to withdraw combat troops from urban bases .
Thirteen US soldiers were killed in combat in April , including the five who died in Mosul .
In other violence , a senior Iraqi traffic officer was assassinated on his way to work in Baghdad , in the second attack on a high - ranking traffic police officer in the capital in as many days .
A car cut off Brigadier General Abdul - Hussein al - Kadhoumi as he drove through a central square in the capital .
Gunmen in a second vehicle pulled up alongside and opened fire , police said , citing witnesses .
Al - Kadhoumi was director of operations for the traffic authority .
The gunmen were armed with pistols equipped with silencers , according to police .
Incidents involving gunmen armed with sophisticated weapons , including silencers , have been on the rise since a string of high - profile robberies in April .
The attack came one day after the convoy of the Baghdad traffic department head , Major General Jaafar Toma , was hit by a roadside bomb .
Four of his bodyguards were wounded but the general escaped unharmed .
Police today reported discovering the body of a 5 - year - old Christian boy , Tony Edward Shawel , who had been kidnapped 10 days earlier in the town of Sheikhan , near Mosul .
The body was found yesterday and police said it showed signs of torture .
His family had been negotiating with the kidnappers to reduce the ransom from the originally demanded $ 50,000 ( £ 33,127 ) .
It seems like every few years we have to have this debate about marijuana , and sometimes other drugs .
But , in the era of hopeNchange , it is becoming louder and more open .
We know that Attorney General Eric Holder has told the DEA to stop raiding “ medical marijuana ” dealers , er , shops .
We know that El Presidente Barack H. Obama thinks pot is a joke , and that lots of folks who voted for him thought the issue of legalizing ganja was a like , ya know , really , wow , cool , man ….look , a quarter !
I will say , I really do not think marijuana is that bad of a drug , there are certainly a lot worse , particularly alcohol , which is much more addictive , mentally and physically , than pot , and much more damaging to the body than pot .
Personally , I could n’t care less if it is legalized and taxed , I ’ve done it , do not care for the affects .
If someone wants to get high and it does n’t affect anyone else , hey , we want government out of our private business , right ?
Slightly less annoying than those who refuse to even debate marijuana policies are those who vaguely support our position , but still mock and insult us for caring about this .
A good recent example was Glenn Beck 's hostile interview with MPP's Rob Kampia , in which he treated Rob with utter contempt only to then announce that he 's a libertarian and he gets it .
It was just weird .
William Teach at Stop
The ACLU put on a similar performance yesterday that I 've read twice now and still do n’t quite understand .
He begins by framing the marijuana debate as the dumbest thing on the planet :
Then , once his condescension is fully indulged , he switches gears and says this :
Precisely .
This is all perfectly simple and logical , so what was it that compelled Teach to begin with a barbed caricature of people who essentially feel exactly as he does ?
We keep seeing this kind of thing lately and I 'm still trying to understand it .
The answer may be that we 've reached a strange moment where the strength of our argument has outpaced the resolution of the cultural and political associations people attach to marijuana use .
In other words , conservatives like Glenn Beck and the folks at Stop The ACLU might simultaneously agree that the war on marijuana is stupid , while also maintaining some animosity towards the stereotypical liberal hippie types that they generally identify the issue with .
If that 's all this is about , that 's fine , but I wonder if anyone would be surprised to learn that the founder of StoptheDrugWar.org , Dave Borden , has never gotten high once in his life .
Or that one of the fastest growing constituencies in drug policy reform right now is former police officers who 've gotten involved after becoming disgusted by the injustice and corruption they witnessed on a daily basis in the war on drugs .
To a tremendous extent , the movement to fix our drug laws is not even driven by a desire among its adherents to take drugs without legal consequence .
It 's about people like Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo , whose dogs were shot dead in a botched police raid over some marijuana that he had nothing to do with .
It 's about cops choking innocent suspects , or selling drugs themselves , or framing innocent people to cover their incompetence .
It 's about horrible crazy fiascos you 'd never even think about .
Since the effects of the drug war are never confined to those who choose to be involved , there 's no easy way to stereotype people who want to change our laws .
There are matters of life , liberty , and death at stake here that reach far beyond whether or not Joe Stoner can legally do as he pleases .
That 's why it 's so hard for me to understand why people who ostensibly agree with our case nonetheless endeavor to turn this into something silly or frivolous .
Perhaps I shall email the folks at Stop The ACLU to request some further insight .
Update : I 've heard back from both Jay Stephenson and William Teach at Stop The ACLU in regards to the post .
Their take is that the tone of Teach 's piece is intended to be humorous , while also taking a dig at naïve Obama supporters .
Basically what I thought .
It 's always interesting to hear how peripheral observers view the issue .
I appreciate that they took the time to read and respond .
Go On Till You Come to the End ; Then Stop ScienceBlogs is coming to an end .
I do n't know that there was ever a really official announcement of this , but t...

Former CIA employee Valerie Plame Wilson testifies at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington March 16 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Israeli actress Liraz Charhi has been cast in “ Fair Game , ” director Doug Liman ’s drama about outed CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
Naomi Watts already has been cast as Plame .
Sean Penn plays her husband , ambassador Joseph Wilson .
Charhi will play the fictional Sawsan , an Iraqi doctor in Cleveland whom Plame sends undercover to Baghdad to gather intelligence on Saddam Hussein ’s nuclear program in exchange for bringing her brother to the U.S .
The movie centers on how Plame ’s status was compromised because of a leak from the Bush administration , allegedly in retaliation for a 2003 op - ed piece her husband wrote claiming the administration manipulated intelligence on Iraq .
Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , who was skeptical of the administration ’s war plans , admitted in 2006 that he was the original source of the leak .
The film , based on Plame ’s memoir , is filming in New York and the Middle East .

3 new S.F. rent laws in the works TENANT LAWS Daly proposes new limits on increases by landlords
Supervisor Chris Daly Supervisor Chris Daly Photo : Deanne Fitzmaurice , The Chronicle Photo : Deanne Fitzmaurice , The Chronicle Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close 3 new S.F. rent laws in the works 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
A San Francisco supervisor is proposing laws intended to keep renters from being priced out of their homes during tough economic times .
Three laws proposed by Supervisor Chris Daly on Tuesday would bar landlords from increasing rent to more than one - third of a tenant 's income , would expand the rights of tenants who want to add roommates , and would limit the amount of so - called banked rent increases in which annual increases allowed under city laws are saved up and then imposed all at once .
The laws would apply only to rent increases and would not help people who cannot afford their current rent .
The proposals immediately drew praise from tenants groups , who said rents have stayed high in San Francisco even as they have dropped elsewhere .
It was slammed by landlords , who argued that property owners already are struggling with a soft rental market and high vacancy rates .
Daly and tenants advocates said that nearly two - thirds of San Franciscans are renters , and that as the federal government steps in to provide relief to homeowners facing foreclosure , governments also should help renters stay in their homes , particularly in a notoriously expensive city .
While the city already imposes strict rent controls on most buildings , the law also allows for incremental annual increases .
" So many tenants are already living on the edge in terms of their housing being even remotely affordable .
They are paying 70 , 80 percent of their income already , " said Sara Shortt , executive director of the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco .
" In many cases , if the rent keeps getting higher and higher and at the same time tenants lose their job or are furloughed , then they are going to be forced to leave their homes . "
But Janan New , executive director of the San Francisco Apartments Association , said she was " shocked " by the proposals , which she sees as legally tenuous .
New said her members are finding it increasingly difficult to make money and keep tenants .
She also encouraged tenants to individually renegotiate their leases or ask landlords for payment plans if they cannot afford to pay their rent , noting that many of her members already are working out such deals .
" You can't impose public policy on private owners .
... Should n't there be some public subsidy ? " she said .
" This is the worst rental market I 've seen in 20 years .
This is n't a market where people want to lose a tenant .
I do n't understand the premise . "
Some tenants said renegotiating their lease is not an option .
One 60 - year - old Western Addition tenant said she could be forced to move in April , when her landlord plans to raise the rent by about $ 60 .
It does n't sound like much , but the tenant , who was forced to leave her job three years ago because of a back injury , brings in just $ 800 a month in income - and her rent would top $ 1,000 come April .
" I 've been in San Francisco for well over 20 years , and I worked for more than 30 years - it was a freak accident that devastated me .
I feel like the rug was pulled out from under me , " said the woman , who did not want her name used because she is in a legal battle with her landlord .
" I 'm trying to figure out what I am going to do . "
Daly 's proposals would change existing rental laws in a city already seen as extremely tenant - friendly .
One proposal would allow a tenant to file a " financial hardship " claim to the Rent Board 's administrative law judge if rent is being increased to more than 33 percent of the tenant 's gross income .
If the claim is granted , the increase would not go into effect until it no longer caused financial hardship to the tenant or until it could be proved that the decision was causing greater hardship to the landlord than to the renter .
Another law would allow renters to add roommates - even if their lease prohibited it - without the landlord increasing the rent .
The number of people living in a unit , however , could not exceed certain numbers : two people in a studio and four people in a two - bedroom unit , for example .
Currently , additional roommates have to be approved by landlords unless they are family members .
The third law would limit the total amount of rent increases every year to 8 percent of the tenant 's base rent .
Advocates said it is common to see banked rent increases when a property changes hands and the new owner realizes he or she is entitled to a number of years ' worth of increases .
It 's not yet clear whether the proposed laws will have sufficient support at the Board of Supervisors , but Mayor Gavin Newsom - who advocates had expected to oppose the measures - appeared open to the ideas .
" Renters deserve relief , too , and these are interesting ideas that are worth looking at , " Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard said .
" But some of the ideas seem a little far - fetched . "

I hope it makes an impact and leads to something good for customers .
My service is pretty good , except for when FAP'd .
That whole thing about being throttled down to dial - up speed is blatantly false .
Dial - up would be a profound upgrade .
When FAP strikes , the internet just stops - period .

Bout time really I was wondering when this was going to happen .
I have hughes net and I can relate to the pain and suffering .
Bad enough having to deal with their speeds and FAP but also the packet loss errors or HTTP transport errors all the time too that I see mainly in the evenings .

This , like most class action lawsuits , will turn into a win-win for the lawyers as well as defendants .
There will be a grand spectacle of courtroom theatrics , excoriating Hughes and making them appear to be worse than Hitler , Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot combined ... and then there will be the predictable result ... tons of coupons to the " victims " which will entitle them to discounted services provided by Hughes of course !
Hughes wins by making money again off of the plaintiffs .
The lawyers win making money off of Hughes .
In the end , the plaintiffs end up putting more of their money into the coffers of a company they hate for a service which clearly does n't meet their needs .
What I do n't get is this .
If your speeds are consistently throttled to those below dialup , then why not just get dialup ?
The plaintiffs clearly have no problems paying ridiculous prices for sub - dialup speeds , why not just get the real thing and save the hassle ?

Because the problem is , Hughes net locks you in to a contract and make it nearly impossible to get out of .
They charge you out of line ETF's and I 've even read horror stories about customers even trying to get through to cancel their service .
If they cannot provide what they advertise , they should not be in business period .

I chalk these experiences up to people not doing proper research on a product or service before committing to it .
I am unfamiliar with civil laws in this regard but if this is indeed true then the government should be holding Hughes ' feet to the fire for false advertising .

As long as you dutifully pay for crappy service , then that 's all you 're going to get .
Why would any business change its ways as long as you keep paying them ?
The problem is the service is " barely good enough " to meet your needs , and hence , you keep paying for it .

That you had good service then is no different from the many of us who have continued to NEVER experience the speeds mentioned in the article .
The suit says " consistently " but the one thing that Hughes / Direcway has never been , in terms of performance , is consistent from one user to the next .
You did not have to be psychic .
You simply could have read the forums here , where you would have learned that the typical poster 4 years ago ( and 5 , and 6 , and 7 ) was having the problems mentioned in the suit .
Problem posting is and was the norm .

That 's all well and good , but for some people , they do n't even know about these forums .
I did n't until after I had Hughes .
I will admit , when I got Hughes , I had n't done very much research on them .
I had satellite before , which was a one - way system through StarConnect .
It worked well enough , very little problem with it .
I wanted a 2 - way system so I could free up my phone line though .
Wild Blue was full in my area , so the only choice I could see was Hughes .
With my previous experience using satellite , I figured it would be just as good if not better .
I was wrong .
Long story short , I was finally able to get out of my contract ( after going through my state 's Attorney General and the Maryland BBB ) and went back to dial - up for a short while before I found I could get EVDO .

This , like most class action lawsuits , will turn into a win-win for the lawyers as well as defendants .
There will be a grand spectacle of courtroom theatrics , excoriating Hughes and making them appear to be worse than Hitler , Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot combined ... and then there will be the predictable result ... tons of coupons to the " victims " which will entitle them to discounted services provided by Hughes of course !
Hughes wins by making money again off of the plaintiffs .
The lawyers win making money off of Hughes .
In the end , the plaintiffs end up putting more of their money into the coffers of a company they hate for a service which clearly does n't meet their needs .
What I do n't get is this .
If your speeds are consistently throttled to those below dialup , then why not just get dialup ?
The plaintiffs clearly have no problems paying ridiculous prices for sub - dialup speeds , why not just get the real thing and save the hassle ?

Thats like saying Verizon 's service sucks in your area , and you are telling people to switch .
But , people can't switch because they are locked in a 2 year contract .

Of course you can switch .
Pay the ETF and you are off .
But this begs the question , why would you retain the crappy service beyond the non-ETF return period ?
If I bring a cell phone home and I cannot use it , I would return it .

People can fully read the contract online before even signing up which fully states the FAP and details what it is .

It 's not HughesNet 's problem these customers did n't read that they have an ETF .
It even states online and when you all them they say the same thing .
And its easy if you do n't want the service after your contract .
you simply cancel the credit card its billed to and be done with it .
If you want out before the end of the contract .... cancel and pay the ~ $ 250 for it and be done .
Cell phone companies charge an ETF so why ca n't HughesNet .
These customers wo n't get anything but a few free months of service and that 's it .
Why ?
Because they 're probably still under contract .

But how do you know the service sucks until you have a sufficient time to try it out ?
You are basically saying I can fully test every feature of a service in 30 days or less .
I consider myself a power user , but there is no way I can test every feature and the quality in 30 days .
I see the 30 day grace period to test immediate things - like can you actually make and receive calls ?

»www.hughesnet.com/ quote : HughesNetÂ® is available everywhere â even where cable Internet and DSL do n't reach .
HughesNet offers a suite of connectivity solutions for your home , business , or enterprise , with download speeds ranging from 1.0 Mbps to 5.0 Mbps .
Front page information .
Does n't matter whats in the TOS , if a customer gets less than that what they purchase then its false advertising .
A lot of people on here think that TOS are the high almighty rules , and they ARE NOT .
So , you would think its ok for me to sit there , start an ISP and say that you will get blazing speeds faster than fiber , yet the fastest you will actually get is dial - up speeds - and in my TOS I state some garbage such as " you will be throttled depending the time and how much you have downloaded " ?

now finally !
someone that gets it - they do allow you to cancel service if ya dont like it !
installing for both wildblue and hughesnet , servicing both as well as being a customer to both over the years , they are both competitive .
they both have the fap .
they are both close to the same speeds .
if they arent , and never have been fast , its the damn installation !
a sloppy install will always have problems and not be as fast .
the problem is , there is only one way to run quality control on an installers work - by a service call by someone competent .
so a lot of sloppy work gets done , resulting in poor service .
its like tossin a coin in the air - this time its hughesnet , next time wild blue

Obviously you 've never had to suffer with satellite .
I am permitted 250 MB daily .
If I go over , I am put into a fapped condition .
Meaning for 25 hours , I am at below dialup speed .
We have n't ever watched Hulu and I can get about 3 YouTube videos before I have to stop for the day .
We do n't stream anything .
All for $ 59.99 monthly and a $ 250 purchased modem and $ 150 install fee ( we were not permitted to install ourselves ) .
I 'm way beyond the 2 year contract , it 's been 6 years now , but I have no alternatives as evdo has a 5 GB cap monthly .

WildBlue also sems to be a bit better with their FAP policy ; every time I 've used WildBlue ( I go to a few places that have no non-sat alternatives for internet above EDGE speeds ) the connection has been predictably crappy , but usable ...

No its not what Hughes fails to tell the customers .
It 's the customers for failing to ask and read .
It 's like having cable or telco bundles .
After your promos run out and your service price goes up , it 's not their fault that you do n't call into get a better rate .
It 's your fault for not doing it .
Everything is explained and is in writing .

Cingular wireless was advertising their " fewest dropped calls " campaign when I had them when in actuality they had the most .
False advertisement ; absolutely ....
Litigation worthy ; hardly !
The problem is subjective .
It will be interesting to see the argument for how a carrier could be held punitively liable for a network that is not uniformly providing a specific speed !.... Now name a provider that does .

It 's an excellent precedent .
What this means is if a company fails to provide the service as contracted , the company is in breach of that contract and the customer leaves without paying a punitive penalty .
As it stands now , Hughesnet can provide beyond horrible service and customers are forced to pay because they 're bound by a contract .

I tried to upload a 253 k file to my website yesterday evening , I tried for about 30 mins before I gave up .
My upload was zero and it was so bad the speed test would not finish .

It 'd probably be expensive , but you could band together with other people in your area and start a wireless internet provider .
Get a T1 , share it out with other people via Motorola Canopy , cap speeds at 512 k or 768 k so nobody hogs the pipe ... expensive to start up ?

Dude I had sat internet it was crap .
I paid over 2 x what I paid for dial - up got about 3 - 4 x the speed ( I had 26 k ) and crappy ping and a cap .
Now thankfully I am on an un-caped WISP , I pay for up to 512k / 128 k 95 + % of the time I get 507k / 256 k .
It works great for gaming VoIP and youtube .
Sat internet should never have been born it is just bad , they give little to no support and it is ALWAYS you fault or your router 's if you have one .

Replying to those who think contract law trumps all other law , satellite ISP 's use public frequency spectrum .
The public has every right to demand by lawsuit or act of Congress that corporations who use it provide an acceptable level of service .
Capitalism performs poorly when their are monopolies and cartels in control .

After the Internet is delivered , corp's . can then make their money delivering services across the Internet .

I actually would n't mind turning highways over to corps .
Make 'em toll roads , and do n't let the unions get too big ...
For broadband infrastructure , it sometimes does n't make sense to wire some people for internet service .
The cost is just too great .
On the other hand , wireless service ( terrestrial , WiMAX for example ) is very doable and will provide decent speeds ( you can get 10 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up over WiMAX if I 'm calculating stuff correctly ) .
All without breaking the bank .

is an effort get closer to companies actually doing the ' right ' thing .
they have lobbyist 's and we the people have class action suits .
still not quit balanced but over all it does have some good impact .
as for not taking something that does n't perform well there are about 300 million here and it would seem that not all of us have learned that lesson yet or maybe when some of us get involved all of the facts are n't available and yes that 's a risk hopefully one rewarded by good value and support and when it is n't then the contract is null .
for both parties at that point .

00000 Bit00 Premium Member Wow , what a difference a few years make
Ahhh , those were the days
At my vacation house in the early 2000's we did n't have digital cable or DSL available so I went with dial - return satellite .
After looking into a few providers I went with AOL Plus DirecPC over SATMEX 5 .
AOL was lame , but their resold service had no FAP while Starband and regular DirecPC service did .
With concurrent connections I routinely saw 3 - 3.5 Mb , all day every day which at the time was even faster than my then Cox@Home service .
And the kicker was the service cost only $ 45 / mo ( $ 24.95 + $ 19.95 for the Plus service ) .
Now with DirecPC ( aka DirecWay aka hughesnet ) people struggle to see 500 kbps with some lucky to beat dial - up .

Nursery , TX dellt6 Member Re : Wow , what a difference a few years make I agree , only wish I could consistently get 500 kbs , when it works in the mornings , I get around 1000 kbs d/l and around 180 - 190 u/l , however around noon daily it 's like someone turns off the bandwidth facet and I do n't have internet until around midnight .
Each new day offers the same of crappy service .
I have threatened lawsuits , I sent a certified letter to their offices in Illinois without anyone even signing for it since it 's been two weeks and no return receipt yet .
I can not say enough bad things about Hughesnet , if there is a God , this company will go the way of the NYTs and GM .

There is only one winner .
There is only one winner in these kinds of cases .
It 's not the consumer , it 's not Hughes , it 's the lawyers .
Hughes is wrong for trying to enforce ETFs on service they can't deliver .
If they could deliver the service as advertised then I would say that the consumer should suck it up or vote with their feet .

uh , then how are the lawyers the only winners here ?
it 's the consumers that will also win as they will be allowed to leave hughes since they cannot provide the service they advertise .

The issue
The real issue is that HughesNet markets their service as high - speed Internet when it really is n't .
Their ads do n't tell people that the speeds they promise are rarely delivered , and they sure do n't mention the FAP .
I would n't have a problem with the service they provide if they simply were honest in their marketing .
And , as for why folks get the service , if someone does n't know another HughesNet customer , how would they evaluate the service ?
From the commercials ?
They promote it as broadband , which we all know it is n't .
And , even though we all know that DSLR is a great place to find reviews , not everyone does .
They see the ads , think about how satellite technology delivers a pretty good TV service , and figure that anything must be better than dialup .
I 'm not defending ignorant consumers , but HughesNet is clearly advertising a service they simply can't deliver .
They either need to drastically improve the service to bring it in line with their advertising or come clean about what they 're really offering .

Nursery , TX dellt6 Member HughesNet Sued For Poor Service
I can only hope for the very , very worst outcome for Hughesnet , if any company ever in history needs to be taken down for non support , false advertisement and a total lack of concern for customers , it 's Hughesnet .
I obtained Direcway in early 2005 and it was great compared to the only other option in my area , dial - up .
However I seemed to notice once the name changed to Hughesnet the service began to drop but it was at least still better than dial - up .
I had been bombarded with annoying pop-ups via their downlink to upgrade , that my 7000 modem was obsolete .
I did n't want to upgrade since my old modem was working fine .
I called tech several times and they acted like they knew nothing about Hughesnet sending out pop-up messages to the 7000 modems wanting everyone to upgrade ' free ' with the only kicker being an extended one - year agreement .
I finally agreed and when the new modem came in I tried to commission it without success , it always failed the point test .
I called tech and they sent out someone to realign the dish , after half a day he finally got it commissioned ( around the first of April ) and ever since then I can only use the internet from morning to around noon each day .
I have complained to many times to their ignorant tech support I 'm surprise they have not blocked my number .
I have run speed tests since the modem was commissioned and about one third of them are ' o ' zero on the upload from afternoon to after midnight .
I told ' tech ' my plan shows I should receive during peak times downloads no worse than 700 kbs and uploads no worse than 100 kbs , what a laugh .
These people lower the up / down load threshold almost on a daily basis now .
Seems if we get around 50 kbs on the upload or around 300 kbs on the download , we should be happy .
I wish Hughesnet could be forced out of business - they need to be held liable for conduct of over - selling their product and cheating all their customers .
However , in reality , I 'm sure they will be in line for a ' bail - out ' instead of actually being made to comply with what they advertise .

Easy , there are a lot of rural areas in CA and the US where wired and wireless broadband is n't available , and there are even areas where there are no landlines ( we have a number of folks here in Mendocino County in Northwestern California who live off the grid ) so not even dialup for those folks .
This is the only choice for some .

Just wait a few more years when LTE rolls out and everybody can get some great speed wirelessly .
I installed a few EVDO systems in homes in the country and had to do much like you did with high gain antennas and amps to get some great speeds .
They were extremely excited to have high speed and not have to worry about dialup or high costs with Sat service and startup .
That 's not bad for country living .
I remember the days when even Sat was highly impractical .

It 's the commercials that bother me For a while Direcway and then Hughesnet used the same actress for their commercials .
Her name is Margaret Easley .
She was a little weird , and transparently insincere , but pleasant enough .
She played the character " April Blessing " on the HBO series BIG LOVE .
Then she was gone , and now Hughesnet uses an actress who is some kind of a midget or deform -o .
She has the same smarmy delivery as Easley , but she has NO WAIST and a huge head and she looks like a mutant or something .
I have DirecTV and when the Hughesnet commercials come on every hour , my wife and I scream " Ahhh , the mutant dwarf beast ! "
It 's a thing we do .
Thank goodness I do n't live in an area in which the only option for " broadband " is satellite internet .

I am one of those living in a rural area , having no other internet option at the time .
They totally ripped me off .
They cancelled my internet service for 24 hours because I downloaded software for my iphone and it exceeded my download limit for the day !
What ???????
It was slower than dialup .
When I tried to cancel my service they charged me an arm and a leg and said I breeched contract .
When I asked to see the contract because I never got one ( therefore never signed one ) they told me they really did n't have a contract ......?????????
When I asked to speak to the manager they told me there was no direct line to the main office .
I asked for a mailing address and they said they could n't give me that information .

My bf and I have been wanting to get a faster connection than dial - up so we have been doing some research as to what is available in our area , ( South East ) there 's a local communication company ( If you can call them a Communications Company , Ugh ! ) that controls the landlines / dsl , so we can't get AT&T , which I had when I lived alone , and there 's Local cable TV ( Charter Comm . ) that does n't come as far as we live , although they say the neighbor above us has it .
And then there is Verizon that offers the usb modems / pc cards .
And of course we have a satellite with Dish network for our TV viewing so we considered getting Hughes net or Wild Blue sat through them , but after reading all these remarks and responses to HN 's lawsuit ...

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China will face safety issues and environmental hazards involving nuclear waste disposal if the nuclear power sector is expanded too fast , the country ’s nuclear safety chief said on Monday .
China , the world ’s second - largest user of fuel and electricity after the United States , plans to quadruple its nuclear power capacity in the next decade to about 40 gigawatts , fast - tracking from an embryonic stage in the last three decades when a total of less than 10 GW was built .
“ At the current stage , if we are not fully aware of the sector ’s over - rapid expansions , it will threaten construction quality and operation safety of nuclear power plants , ” Li Ganjie , director of National Nuclear Safety Administration , told the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy .
It would also undermine the country ’s plan to use more domestic technology and pose problems in the disposal of nuclear waste , said Li , who is also a vice minister of Ministry of Environmental Protection .
China is adding 24 reactors totaling 25.4 gigawatts of installed capacity , including five plants set to kick off constructions this year , a top planning official said earlier on Friday .
Firms like Westinghouse , owned by Japan ’s Toshiba and France ’s Areva , are among the latest suppliers of nuclear technology .
Miss California USA can retain her crown after questions arose about semi-nude photographs taken of her as a teenager and her association with an anti-gay marriage group , pageant owner Donald Trump said .
Carrie Prejean 's comments about her opposition to same - sex marriage ignited a media firestorm after a celebrity judge suggested her response may have cost her the Miss USA title ; she finished as first - runner up .
The photos surfaced later and led to the review of her title .
" We 've reviewed the pictures carefully , " Trump said at a packed news conference at Trump Plaza in New York City yesterday .
" We 've made a determination that the pictures taken were acceptable .
Some were risque , but we are in the 21st century . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Trump also defended the answer Prejean gave at the April 19 Miss USA pageant .
She was asked her view of marriage by celebrity blogger Perez Hilton .
Prejean said she believes marriage is only between a man and a woman .
Trump only briefly addressed questions surrounding Prejean 's association with the National Organization for Marriage , a group that opposes same - sex marriage .
He dismissed them as a " communication problem " between Prejean and California pageant officials .
Before competing in the Miss California USA competition , all prospective contestants are required to sign a detailed 12 - page contract prohibiting Miss California USA from making personal appearances , giving interviews or making commercials without permission from pageant officials .
The contract also contains a clause asking participants to disclose whether they have conducted themselves " in accordance with the highest ethical and moral standards . "
It asks participants whether they have ever been photographed nude or partially nude .
After Trump spoke , Prejean , who was accompanied by her parents , took her turn at the lectern , defending herself against " hateful attacks , despicable rumors and false allegations . "
" On April 19 on that stage I exercised my freedom of speech , and I was punished for doing so , " said Prejean , who described Hilton 's question as " politically charged " with a " hidden personal agenda . "
" This should not happen in America . "

In an interview with The Associated Press , Prejean said she was briefly tempted by Satan to answer Hilton 's question in a way that would please the judges .
" I had worked so hard for this , " she said .
Instead , she decided to give her honest opinion , even if it cost her points .
" The Lord was in my heart and in my head just saying , ' Carrie , how bad do you want this ?
Are you willing to deny me ? " ' she said .
" I will always continue to not compromise my values . "
Trump 's senior executive assistant , Rhona Graff - Ricci , said Trump would n't answer further questions about Prejean 's dealings with the marriage group .
Officials at the Miss Universe Organization , which runs Miss USA , did n't immediately return a message Tuesday .
Prejean told the AP that she was not working with the National Organization for Marriage .
After the pageant , Prejean revisited the same - sex - marriage issue in interviews and televised talks , including one at her San Diego megachurch and another on behalf of the marriage group .
On Tuesday , the group featured a photo of Prejean on its Web site and said it had launched a new advertisement against gay marriage featuring footage of her at the pageant .
The ad also features video of Hilton referring to Prejean with a profanity .
The Miss Universe Organization has demanded that the group remove the ad .
Brian Brown , the National Organization for Marriage 's executive director , said the group did not plan to comply .
First things first .
This post is not about Leonard Nimoy .
This post is DEFINITELY NOT about Zachary Quinto .
This post is about Spock and why I would n’t mind having a little bit of ( perhaps half ) Vulcan in me .
Seeing as how this is the most obvious reason for Spock ’s sex appeal , let ’s get it out of the way quickly — the guy is insanely intelligent .
With a brain that big , you ’d have to assume proportionality worked in his favor .
He served as Science Officer under two different captains , and I would n’t mind serving as a “ science officer ” under him .
Spock is notorious for his inability ( or refusal ? ) to display emotions .
Even the beautiful Leila Kalomi could n’t get the words out of him without using a pod plant to infect Spock ’s emotional control .
Granted , if he tells you that he loves you , he ’d have to really fucking love you .
Be wary , however – while he might declare his devotion , he might not tell you if he has another name .
27 -YEAR -OLD SPOILER ALERT , he dies .
In Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , Khan activated the Genesis Device to fuck up the Enterprise .
The warp drive got damaged and released all sorts of radiation .
Spock restores power to the ship but dies from the radiation poisoning .
The crew holds a funeral and shoots his body into space ; he eventually lands on the Genesis planet , which reverses his body into a baby again .
The point ?
Spock can love you forever .
Although he comes off as a gentle and reserved being , Spock is honed with impressive physical abilities .
In addition to his strength , stamina , and agility , he also seems to know the exact points on the human body for instant reaction — namely , the Vulcan nerve pinch .
Perhaps he is aware of other nerve pinches that can deliver an equally climactic sensation ?
Also , let ’s not overlook the fact that he does n’t need food or sleep for days on end — a remarkable endurance that can easily come in handy .
While it may require a bit of usurping , Spock will sing beautifully to you .
Perhaps even pants - less .
In addition to this musical talent , he can also play the piano and the beautiful Vulcan lute .
What other finger and throat exercises do you need , Mr. Spock ?
Here ’s a clip of him singing in “ Plato ’s Stepchildren . ”
Pay close attention to the lyrics — I know I did .
[ youtube ] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUa6CxEcIPs[/youtube](Note: if you enjoy Nimoy ’s singing , make sure to check out the Ballad of Bilbo Baggins )
Spock knows how to do it : he can share thoughts , experiences , memories and knowledge with other beings , simply from the act of touching .
He can do it with one hand , two hands , or no hands .
Do you know what this entails ?
Dirty talk from across the room .
Knowing exactly why you ’re mad even though you say you ’re not mad .
Endless mindfucking .
I ’ll admit it : he can mind - meld me without my consent any time he wants .
Everything adds up —
Spock is a bold , bold man .
He handles the Horta when Kirk is too much of a pussy .
His evil alter - ego can sport a goatee .
He even made out with Uhura .
He ’s a man of poise and assertiveness .
Given his confidence in taking risks , I ’d have no problem in casually running into him while he ’s going into pon farr .
And should he ever break my heart , I trust in knowing that he is , and always will be , my friend .
I ’ve already announced the type of man I ’m looking for on Craigslist and I declared my love for five video game characters .
Granted , I hope that this post comes as no surprise to you .
FLANKED by Australia 's senior soldiers , Kevin Rudd , the prime minister , stood on a navy frigate in Sydney Harbour on May 2nd and talked of likely future tensions in Asia and the Pacific .
He was launching Australia 's first defence white paper in almost a decade .
The show of naval muscle was calculated .
His government plans a military build - up over the next 20 years as a hedge against the tensions , which it worries are most likely to come from China .
There will be only a modest rise in the number of military personnel , of about 3,000 to 57,000 .
But the navy and air force will get the hardware to build what the paper calls a “ heavier and more potent maritime force ” .
The submarine fleet will be replaced and doubled in size to 12 .
There will be a new fleet of 11 frigates and air - warfare destroyers , equipped , like the submarines , with cruise missiles .
The air force will get about 100 new fighter - bombers .
Mr Rudd calls the build - up “ the most powerful , integrated and sophisticated set of military capabilities ” Australia has had .
It is estimated to cost around A$ 100 billion ( $ 74 billion ) .
But what is it for ?
For most of its life , Australia has relied for its security on the naval presence in the Pacific region of first Britain then , since the second world war , America .
The paper predicts that China 's rise as an economic and military giant could well end all that .
It sees China as possibly becoming the world 's biggest economy by 2020 .
That , plus its military modernisation and the testing of America 's primacy , could give China 's regional neighbours “ cause for concern ” .
This implies China has now replaced Indonesia as the main strategic threat to Australia .
But the paper talks only of a remote but plausible confrontation with “ a major - power adversary ” .
The new hardware 's priority will be defending Australia 's northern approaches from the Indian Ocean via the Timor Sea to Polynesia .
The American alliance will remain pivotal .
But Australia will no longer put troops at risk “ in distant theatres of war where we have no direct interests ” ( read Iraq , but perhaps not Afghanistan ) .
Self - reliance is one thing .
How Australia 's region will respond to its apparent preoccupation with China as a possible future adversary is another .
Mr Rudd seems keen not to let China 's status as Australia 's biggest trading partner override its security concerns .
But Hugh
White , a defence analyst , and an author of the last white paper in 2000 , worries that this one lacks answers on how this can be achieved .
“ It 's reluctant to tell Australians that we have to think seriously about living in an Asia that will be very different from anything we have known , ” he says .
Apparently the Chef at Channel Four took exception to Grub Street ’s post about the bacon explosion now being offered at the restaurant .
He emailed them to complain that they had used words like “ hilarious ” “ puke ” and “ vomit ” to describe something they had never even tried .
( If you are a little behind , the Irish pub Channel Four , on 48th btw .
5+6th , is serving a version of the “ Bacon Explosion ” a monstrosity that made the food blog rounds at the beginning of the year . )
Hilarious , puke and vomit all come to mind … as does “ deliciousness ” and “ omg must have ” .
GS also admits to being sarcastic about ordering it a day in advance … apparently it ’s “ tastefully served ” as two thin slices inside a slider bun .
Slider ?
You mean … a sandwich !
If this thing is under $ 10 , it would be perfect for the Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge !
I called Channel Four this morning , and found out that the chef changes it up every day depending on how he feels .
Sometimes as a slider , sometimes over toast … sometimes it comes with tater tots , and sometimes with corn pudding .
All depends on the day .
The good news … it ’s $ 9.95 !
The bad news … they were pretty clear it was more of a snack than a meal .
That ’s kind of disappointing .
Maybe the chef will create a $ 10 sandwich version for Midtown Lunchers .
Can you say Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge ?!?!
C’mon Channel
Four , let ’s make this happen …

AS YOUNG women emerge in chattering , self - confident groups from the university building on the Didouche Mourad Boulevard in Algiers , it might seem that the country 's decade - long nightmare of violence never happened .
These students were toddlers when the first - round election victory of an Islamist party in 1992 brought army tanks onto the streets .
Up to 200,000 people may have been killed in the eight years of strife that ensued .
Today 's students may have just left primary school when Abdelaziz Bouteflika was declared president in 1999 , amid claims of electoral fraud .
Now , it seems , he is to lead their country for yet another five years , due to a constitutional amendment to let him run for a third term .
His re-election is expected on April 9th , despite a handful of well - vetted opponents .
Mr Bouteflika is bent on staying in power despite reports of bad health that have dogged him for years .
Even his harshest critics admit that his ten years as president have brought — or at least coincided with — an end to the darkest years of conflict .
He enticed most of the armed Islamist groups down from the hills with amnesties .
He has sacked some of the generals who ran the no-holds - barred counter - terrorism of the 1990s .
The secret service , whose listeners were said to lurk on every street corner , is no longer so nosy .
Districts of Algiers once in the grip of local “ emirs ” — gang leaders with an Islamist veneer who sometimes displayed their victims ' heads on pikes — have regained a humdrum normality .
The police and gendarmes , once targeted for assassination by Islamist militants as they helped out with the dirty work of arbitrary detention and torture , have been retrained and try to behave well , at least in public .
The avuncular Mr Bouteflika has helped reduce the bitterness between the large body of opinion receptive to Islamist ideas and the secular - minded Francophone intellectuals terrified of the Islamist Salvation Front that won the poll in 1992 .
Though many female undergraduates in Algiers wear the Islamist headscarf , their bare - headed fellow students are equally at ease .
Local commentators , however , detect a groundswell of religious observance .
Mr Bouteflika tries to surf the trend rather than resist it .
His government includes the Islamists of the Social Movement for Peace , who trace their line back to Egypt 's Muslim Brothers .
Their views are echoed in mosque sermons broadcast every Friday on state television .
AFP
Yes he can …have five more years
The average Algerian , not to mention foreign investors , can only guess at the shifting alliances and tensions in the civilian and military establishment .
But it is hard to find much enthusiasm for Mr Bouteflika 's third term .
He is at least a known quantity in a murky political landscape , but few Algerians are proud of their country 's politics .
Many ask , “ Where has all the money from oil and gas gone ? ”
In fact , a lot of new housing and infrastructure has been built .
The outskirts of Algeria 's second city , Oran , are dotted with scores of new high - rise housing blocks that have replaced slums .
A new east - west motorway is to extend to Algeria 's long - closed border with Morocco .
The government paid off most of the country 's external debt when oil prices were high .
Middle - class Algerians bought so many imported Renault , Peugeot and Hyundai cars that the government slapped on a sales tax to reduce traffic jams .
The sales of a mobile phone operator , Djezzy , owned by Egypt 's Orascom , boomed .
But a decision by Orascom 's construction arm in 2007 to sell some cement plants it had built in northern Algeria to France 's Lafarge — at a fat profit and without consulting Algeria 's government — is said to have turned Mr Bouteflika against foreign investors .
Now they can own only 49 % of any Algerian company .
Nor can they buy the land on which to build a factory .
Many investors lack confidence in Algeria 's oft - changing legal system .
In December a licensing round for 15 blocks of oil and gas exploration got only nine bids , as the big foreign oil companies grumble about Algeria 's tax burden .
The government says it wants to liberalise the economy .
But it moves very slowly .
Algeria 's private businessmen chafe under a heavy bureaucratic yoke .
Some younger people who fled abroad in the 1990s have come home , bringing back valuable professional experience .
But many leave again .
A recent opinion poll found that 29 % of men between 15 and 34 “ certainly ” intended to emigrate to Europe or elsewhere illegally ; 21 % said they “ probably ” would .
Youths on a street corner in Oran explain that Europe offers more and better - paid jobs , more human rights , more fun .
Under Algeria 's continuing state of emergency , many people still fear wrongful arrest .
Businessmen fear punitive tax demands if , say , they offend an official .
Islamist violence has recently begun to bubble up again .
Armed Islamists , most of them in the hilly Berber region of Kabylie , have become bolder .
Almost every day , newspapers report a traveller robbed , a businessman kidnapped , an army patrol attacked or a villager killed for co-operating with the army in the past .
So Algeria is still a long way from true normality .
Major - General Muhammad Mediene still runs the security service , as he did in 1990s , when even officials admit that more than 6,500 people were killed after last being seen in the hands of the security forces .
Under five more years of Mr Bouteflika , do not expect drastic change .
LIMA , Peru ( CNN ) --
A three - judge panel of the Peruvian Supreme Court found former President Alberto Fujimori guilty Tuesday on charges involving human rights violations , including murder and kidnapping , and sentenced him to 25 years in prison .
Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori speaks before the court in Lima earlier this month .
During the three - hour hearing that ended a 15 - month trial , the 70 - year - old former leader , wearing a dark suit and tie and sitting ramrod straight , wrote frequently in a notebook and occasionally sipped from a glass of water .
He showed no emotion as the verdict was announced .
Fujimori , whose parents were Japanese immigrants , had faced a possible 30 years in prison .
Jose Miguel Vivanco , director of Human Rights Watch , expressed satisfaction with the sentence , calling it " perfectly proportional to the grave deeds that are imputed to him . "
" This is an historic case , " he told CNN en Español about the democratically elected former president 's conviction on rights violations in his own country .
The case is " without precedent in the world , not just in Latin America , " he said .
" After years of evading justice , Fujimori is finally being held to account for some of his crimes , " said Maria McFarland , senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch , who was in the courtroom for the announcement .
" With this ruling , and its exemplary performance during the trial , the Peruvian court has shown the world that even former heads of state cannot expect to get away with serious crimes . "
Judge Cesar San Martin told the courtroom that Fujimori was responsible for the actions of the Colina unit , blamed for killing dozens of people as the government sought to halt the Shining Path rebel group .
Fujimori said he would appeal .
Outside the courtroom , Fujimori's 33 - year - old daughter , Keiko , herself running as a candidate in the 2011 presidential election , said the ruling was full of " hate and vengeance . "
" We 're going into the streets to demonstrate our open support for the best president this country has ever had , to the president who saved Peru from terrorism , " she told reporters .
But a group of relatives of the dead expressed satisfaction with the sentence .
" For the first time , they have respected the right of families to the truth and justice , " said one woman .
" For the first time , they dignify the memory of the families ... I hope that this history of impunity not be allowed to recur . "
Also outside the courtroom , pro- and anti-Fujimori activists scuffled , but there were no reports of serious injuries .
Javier Zuniga , a special adviser to the secretary general for Amnesty International , was in the courtroom as the verdict was read .
" We have been with the families celebrating , " he said several hours later .
He praised the prosecutors , saying , " They showed that what happened in the organization could not have happened if there had not been high - level planning , a state machinery to kill , organized by the president himself . "
And he predicted that the case will be studied in law schools around the world .
Fujimori , who is already serving a six - year sentence on separate charges involving abuse of power , led Peru from 1990 to 2000 , at the height of the country 's war with the radical Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement .
He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads in 1991 and 1992 during what is often referred to as Peru's " dirty war . "
" I had to govern from hell , not a palace , but from a hell that those who accuse me did not live like I had to live , " Fujimori recently told the court .
" I only expect that those who sentence me consider for a moment that hell and not pretend to civilize from a distance . "
Fujimori's pro-business policies were credited with helping steer the country away from financial disaster in the early 1990s , and he remains popular among many of his countrymen .
Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this story from Lima , Peru .

Gwyneth Davies , from Treharris , near Merthyr Tydfil , south Wales , hit the man four times with her metal stick when she caught him breaking into her kitchen on Friday evening .
The pensioner said the man then buried his face in his hands and wept as she made him sit on a stool and stood guard over him until the police arrived .
Mrs Davies was getting ready for bed when she heard a crash in the kitchen and went to investigate .
She opened the door and found herself face - to - face with the man , who had broken in through the back door .
She said : I heard a bang so I went to look , and there he was standing on the other side of the kitchen door .
“ I was n’t going to have this - I thought I ’d do something about it .
He played right into my hands , so I let him have it .
Police raided a cannabis factory after a neighbour 's dog was overcome by the strong fumes coming from the next door house .
Valerie Bailey said her west highland terrier Holly appeared to be " stoned " by the strong smell coming from the hundreds of cannabis plants being cultivated in the building next door to their home in Reading , in Berkshire .
People have a hard time grasping that given the tumultuous market of 2009 and all the liquidity being funneled into the market by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , that the U.S. Dollar has only fallen 2 percent for the year .
What is even more surprising to many is the U.S. Dollar has remained unchanged since the crisis started in August of 2007 .
How can that be you say ?
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have bailed out Wall Street and banks with commitments and direct credit injections to the tune of $ 13 trillion yet the dollar remains unchanged .
Let us first look at a graph to show this :
In fact , at the market bottom in March of 2009 , the dollar flirted with the 90 mark .
This would have been a 10 percent jump from the same point back in August of 2007 .
How can the dollar remain strong with so much money being funneled into the economy and the U.S. lagging in a deep recession ?
First , it is important to understand that at the bottom in March over $ 50 trillion in global wealth was destroyed .
That is simply a mind - numbing amount .
In the massive panic of the market lows , many people still had faith in the dollar and rushed into it .
It is still largely viewed as a safe haven .
Also , the major decoupling philosophy has been largely put to rest since this recession is global .
If you look at the chart above , in the spring and summer of 2008 the dollar was in the low 70s .
This occurred because a large number of investors believed that the world would largely remain healthy while the U.S. fell into a deep recession by itself .
That of course was not the case .
Yet over the longer term , the U.S. dollar has suffered and has suffered in big ways .
Let us look at a longer - term chart :
Looking at this chart , we realize how much the dollar has really declined .
Since the start of the decade , the dollar has fallen a stunning 33 percent .
Keep in mind with currencies these kind of large fluctuations are not a sign of health .
Major market volatility is never the sign of a healthy market .
As I have stated before the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are actively trying to crush the value of the dollar .
There weapon of choice is inflation .
Why would the central bankers aim for inflation ?
For one , our country is a debtor nation to the ultimate degree .
There is simply no way we are ever going to pay back our obligations .
Inflation is an excellent way to make current debts less costly in the long run ( at least in the view of the Federal Reserve ) .
Yet inflation is rarely an easy target to set especially when we are dealing with the prospect of deflation .
Deflation is kryptonite for debtors because the debt does not decrease over time .
Think of a home that has lost 50 percent of its value .
The home is now worth $ 200,000 while the mortgage stays at $ 400,000 .
In a simple theoretical world , a weak dollar would make our products more desirable around the world thus boosting domestic production .
The only problem is we have outsourced a large part of our manufacturing base .
There is no amount of lowering that is going to compete with wages put out by China and India for example .
The dollar problem is compounded by the fact that globally , central banks have been cutting rates simultaneously .
It has been a race to the bottom .
Each economy facing their own internal pressures had to lower their fund rates to stay competitive .
That is why our zero bound Fed rate has largely left the market moving in the same place .
Other global bankers have also cut back like the ECB for example .
Yet the U.S. Treasury and Fed are trying to exercise this dollar destruction as quietly as possible .
What do you think the public would say if they realized that the central bank of our country is deliberately trying to dilute their respective currency ?
People would be in an uproar .
Yet the fact of the matter is we now have some 25,000,000 unemployed or underemployed Americans that have taken a major hit to their purchasing power .
Why do Americans feel poorer ?
Because since the start of the decade our U.S. dollar has lost 33 percent of its value .
Couple this with stagnant wages and you can understand why this recession has been so destructive .
The dollar has been declining for the entire time but what pushed it over the edge was our current recession .
Most Americans for the early part of the decade did n’t feel this drop because they made up for their lost purchasing power by borrowing more and more debt :
What we are now coming to terms with is the reality of our situation .
A currency that is worth 33 percent less from the start of the decade and the revelation that a large part of the wealth created in the 2000s was largely based on pure debt .
Hard to envision a second half recovery .
Looks like we are heading more to a second half realization .

Jeff Soto makes his United Kingdom debut this week with his solo show entitled “ The Inland Empire ” ( teased ) opening Thursday , May 14th , at Stolenspace .
AM caught up with Soto ahead of the show to try and understand how the show came together , the symbolism and meaning behind his new work and how fatherhood has changed his career as an artist .
Read the entire interview and see some sneak peeks of the work after the jump .
Note :
The interview contains use of strong language .
Arrested Motion ( AM ) : Your show “ The Inland Empire ” will be your first solo outside of the United States .
How does it feel to be going international ?
Jeff Soto ( JS ) : It ’s a great feeling , I ’m psyched to meet some of my UK fans .
I ’ve had a lot of opportunities to do shows outside of the US but the timing was never right , so it has n’t happened except for group exhibits .
For years I was alternating my show schedule between LA and NY , so it was time to do something different and connect with another country .
After the US , the UK has been my biggest supporters so it made sense to do a London show .
I ’ve never been to the UK but am leaving tomorrow and really looking forward to seeing the city .
AM : Can you tell us how you hooked up with Stolenspace for this show ?
Was it a conscious choice for you to show at this gallery in particular for your debut UK show ?
JS : About a year ago I started planning with Jonathan Levine and I told him I ’d like to do a show in London sometime in 2009 .
He knew D*Face at StolenSpace , and we all started floating ideas back and forth .
It turned out D* Face was a fan of my work , and I was a fan of his , and the match just seemed to work so I said let ’s do it .
When I look at all the artists they ’ve shown , people like Kinsey , Alexone , Seen , Will Barras , Andrew McAttee , the list goes on - these are all artists I respect so much and have been following for years .
I like their whole roster , and to show in the same place as all these artists is an honor .
It just seemed to be a natural fit .
AM : The title “ The Inland Empire ” is a reference to your home environs and we understand that part of the underlying theme is the recession – particularly in and around the Riverside area due to it being a commuter suburb of Los Angeles .
Has the global recession had a direct effect on you , both as an individual and as an artist ?
JS : Well , my area has been hit hard .
Tons of people bought artificially expensive houses out here and when the values dropped they became upside down on their mortgages .
Now I ’m seeing more of my studio neighbors close shop , which makes me sad .
These are good hard working people that ca n’t pay their bills and it ’s a bummer .
I am definitely seeing it change the way people buy art these days .
I think a lot of pieces were moving on pure hype , buyers would snatch up anything they could get on fears that shows would sell out quickly .
Some still do , but overall , things have slowed down for everyone .
Buyers are reeling back a little and buying more intelligently .
They are asking for deals or trying to work direct with the artists .
It is kind of a scary time for many artists and galleries , and I think we ’re going to see many fade away in the next couple of years .
As for myself , I am caught up in this too , though I am not feeling the pinch so bad .
I think the only things artists can do is make the best work possible .
AM : Mainly for our non-US based readers , where does the term Inland Empire originate and what are the meanings behind the term ?
Can you ever see yourself living in Los Angeles and being closer to the epicenter of the art scene there or will Riverside always hold a special place in your heart and continue to be a source of inspiration for your work ?
JS : Inland Empire is the name given to the large inland valley area east of Los Angeles .
Sort of like a suburb of a suburb , really just part of the huge continuous sprawl from the coast to the ocean .
People out here have a lot of pride in the area , there ’s a lot of I E tattoos , car decals boldly proclaiming Inland Empire , and the style is a mix of gangster , motocross , stripper / porn , and goth .
It ’s a weird place full of contradictions .
I like it and sometimes I hate it .
We do talk about moving but I would n’t move closer to L.A .
Were already close enough .
I do n’t know if that ’s the epicenter anymore , at least from my point of view .
Sure there are a lot of galleries and a lot of shows to see .
But are the shows good ?
Is the work original ?
There are some great shows nowadays , but many are played out .
I think things were really happening in L.A. in the early 2000 ’s- galleries like La Luz de Jesus , New Image Art , Merry Karnowsky , the work was fresh , seemed like every show was something to make the hour drive for .
But anyways , I got off topic .
I do n’t know if this movement has an epicenter anymore .
L.A. was it for a while , but maybe NY is coming along …
AM : You are planning an outdoor installation or mural as part of this exhibition being that you have a history of outdoor work going back to your early days as an artist .
We are familiar with some of your recent indoor installations , but we ca n’t think of seeing any recent outdoor examples .
Has it been a while since you ’ve done such a thing and are you looking forward to getting some sun on your back ?
JS : Yeah , I am looking forward to it .
Painting outdoors on a large scale has always been part of my life .
It ’s been a while though , I retired from painting graffiti a number of years ago , so I ’m gonna be rusty , but who cares .
I still do n’t know where or what I ’ll be painting , but I figure D*Face might know some spots , and there ’s an art supply place around the corner from where I ’m staying .
Hopefully I paint some cool stuff .
AM : We hear that you are releasing an exclusive screen print and doing a book signing at the opening .
The intro to your latest book “ Storm Clouds ” was written by David Choe and it was probably one of the craziest introductions to an art monograph we ’ve ever read !
What did you think of his “ Jeff Soto is Pearl Jam ” line ?
JS : Dude , he ’s a genius !
He ’s so perverted and so am I .
The difference is I keep it in .
I love his fucked up writing style , his bad punctuation and misspellings .
I asked him to do an intro to my book , and I knew I ’d get some classic Choe .
I ’m going to paste it in below for those who have n’t read it …
As I slid my dick into her ass , the words
“ And everything I ca n’t remember ,
As fucked up as it all may seem ,
The consequences that I ’ve rendered ,
I ’ve gone and fucked things up again . ”
blasted out of her radio , this is a song by the band staind , I know this , not because I like their music , I actually fucking hate their music and everyone who like ’s their music , but I know this because she screamed out “ ooh this is staind , my favorite band !
I love this song !!! ” as she sang along word for word , as I fucked her from behind , this mildly annoyed me , but not really , afterall , I did n’t meet many women that let me put my parts into their buttholes , BUT then as she was still singing along , she saw a jeff soto poster I had hanging out of my bag , from an issue of art prostitute , and commented “ ooh I love that guys art !
My last boyfriend collected it , it ’s ( ############ ) right ?!?! ”
As she looked back at me with a goofy proud ignorant smile on her retraded face , the staind reference was n’t enough to upset me , but after that , I wanted to choke the fucking shit out of her , and then remembered that she actually likes that , so I finished violently pounding her ass , and went home , what the fuck was going on in this fucking world ?!?
As I got on the bus , I started to reflect on shit , as I sniffed shit on my fingers , there were all these horribly shitty fucking bands like CREED , STAIND , NICKLEBACK , etc. and they were fucking huge ?!?
These were people ’s favorite bands !!
they loved and worshipped them !!
could n’t they see they were all fucking horrible , and just wanted to be like Pearl Jam ?
Then this got me started thinking about jeff soto , jeff soto is pearl jam , pearl jam is this awesome grunge band from the 90’s that sort of sounded like a little of this and a little of that , but in the end they blended it into their own shit and they fucking rocked .
I do n’t even know if Jeff likes pearl jam , but basically this fucker comes from a background that includes fine art , graffiti , zine ’s , and illustration and comes blasting out , and he fucking kills it , I never seen a guy so new to the art scene that has spawned more imitators and biters so quickly , everywhere I go I see these unoriginal cliche ’d images of straight jeff soto bites and it kills me , it makes me want to choke the fucking shit out of them , and I will !
because jeff is too nice to do it , for them it ’s all on the surface there ’s nothing underneath , and people are so crazy about art right now , they ’ll buy and listen to anything , there ’s no accounting for taste !
Soto has seamlessly combined his love for graffiti , cartoons and growing up in los angeles ’ cultural wasteland ( the OC and Riverside ) , into beautiful paintings , he takes the same care and attention to detail , to render , roy fokker ’s Valkyrie VF - 1S ve ritech fighter as he does rendering a Euphorbiaceae Succulent , and then all these fuckers come along and see his cactus and just bite his shit , fuck them , Jeff is the king !
buy his shit !
At this point , since jeff asked me to write this intro , I ’d like to say two things , one is an apology for one of the worst unprofessional intros ever , I do n’t even know if it makes any sense , and two is a formal thank you to jeff .
Many years ago , when their were many more people actively trying to end my art career , I barely knew jeff , I had met him once or twice at comicon and he was nice enough to invite me into a group show he was curating focused on robots .
it ’s pretty much my favorite shit to draw , so I immediately said yes , soon after , i got news that the 100 plus person art show was not gonna happen , Because the venue found out i was gonna be a part of it , and would not have the show , unless jeff kicked me out of the show .
So that was that , I knew I was gonna get kicked out , it was better than having the police try to look for me at an art show that happened earlier that week , Jeff did n’t know me , he didn9 9t owe me shit , why would he risk this huge project he put together , just so I could stay and play , so he calls me and says “ I do n’t know you , and I do n’t know what you did , but I like you and I like your art , and you never did shit to me , so I ’m gonna keep you in the show and just find someplace else to show it . ”
I always remembered that , a scholar and a gentleman , so if I did n’t say it back then , I ’ll say it right now , thank you jeff , you rule the school !
Love david choe - las vegas , bellagio business center
p.s. hey jeff if you do n’t like the pearl jam reference just switch it to any band you like that rocks .
i just used it because they ’re the most imitated rock band , and your the most imitated artist , the real song that she sang along to was “ My Own Worst Enemy ” by lit which is actually a guilty pleasure but i will never admit to
p.s.s my dick was never in her ass , it just made a better opening statement , it was just the tip
P.S.S.S. it was never even just the tip or “ My Own Worst Enemy ” by lit , it was just me sitting in my bedroom by myself , reading a stack of punisher comics and pornos , glancing up at that art prostitute poster , getting mad at all the biters , and then getting a sandwich and taking a nap .
everything else i wrote is true .
AM : Your wife recently gave birth to your second daughter , Natalie Rose , so firstly congratulations to you and Jen from all of us at AM .
How has being a father affected the content and also the context of your work ?
There seemed to be a shift in the theme of your work around and about the time that your first daughter , Shannon , was born .
We ’ve seen significantly less of the robot inspired and walker - type character based work that you became known for earlier in your career and your output seemed to take on a different aesthetic .
What was it that triggered the shift ?
JS : I used to think my work took a more serious tone after I became a father , and maybe that ’s somewhat true , but really I think my work was already starting to evolve into a new direction before my first daughter was born .
I ’d always been interested in the problems we face in this world , and the robots usually represented man vs. nature conflicts .
At some point I started feeling like my collectors were buying my work just for the robots and not looking at what I was trying to say .
It started to feel gimmicky to me , and I felt like I was falling into that trap of having to paint the same thing my entire career .
I mean , those paintings always sold .
It would have been easy to just keep pumping them out , but where would that get me ?
It sounds funny , but for the first time in years I started thinking about all the possibilities of art making again , there were so many things to use as imagery , so many styles and techniques , and that ’s just within painting .
I opened my mind and slowly pushed off from some of the older ideas , and I feel my work is richer , both visually and conceptually .
Many of my past collectors have come along for the ride and I thank them .
To the ones who like the old stuff better , I want to thank them too , they provided the roots for the tree to grow !
AM : How does being a father tie in with your working hours ?
What is the typical routine for Mr. Soto ?
JS : It is tough sometimes .
I know many artists who do n’t want kids , I guess they think it might cramp their style , ca n’t party as much , or they just do n’t want the responsibility .
I do n’t fault them for it , being an artist is like having two full time jobs , and it is tough to raise a family with all the stress of shows , travel and random things that blow in .
It is all about balancing family stuff with a demanding job .
For example , today we had a birthday party for my daughter ’s friend , got back , made dinner , gave baths , rocking the baby till midnight , and now I am finally able to get to this interview at 1 am .
I still have to pack , leaving for London in the morning .
But I would n’t trade it for the world man .
I love being a dad , it made me a better human .
My wife is awesome , she puts up with a lot !
AM : One thing that seems to be a consistent reference that we ’ve seen you use for a long time is palm trees and power lines disappearing into the distance .
What do these images represent in your work ?
We ’re also intrigued what the rainbows in the newer works signify .
JS : Phone lines were all around when I was a kid but now you see cell towers disguised as pine trees .
Something kinda cool and fucked up about that .
Palm trees are all over and somewhat a symbol of Southern California ; I guess much of what I paint is just the stuff in our lives .
Megan Whitmarsh summed it up perfectly and way better than I ever could in her show “ The Fucking Crap of Life ” .
It ’s just all our junk , things we need or think we need , and my brain just randomly coming up with things .
The rainbows were cool in the 80’s , I guess it ’s a little nostalgia thrown in .
Yeah nostalgia … I like it …
AM : One thing that we should ask for fear of old school Soto fans lynching us if we did n’t use this opportunity :
What has happened with plans to release the Walker vinyl edition ?
Is there a glimmer of hope that this project is still running and will it ever see the light of day ?
JS : Naw , it ’s dead man .
I thought it could happen for a long time but it was just too complex a piece , so many poseable parts , I had high expectations , Conor had high expectations , and the factories were having a hard time , bad communication , mental breakdowns , me sometimes just not giving a shit … it was all our faults , I think it was going to have to retail for hundreds of dollars just to break even .
It sort of scared me away from making any vinyl toys for awhile , left a bad taste in my mouth , though I am still cool with all involved .
AM : Have you made your must see list of things to do while you are in London ?
Is it your first time here ?
Are you going to be rocking an “ I heart London ” t- shirt and getting all touristy ?
JS : For sure !
I like all the touristy stuff .
Got to hit up the Eye , the Tate , that big cathedral , might even take one of those double decker tours if I have time .
It is sad , but I ’m also going to get lots of sleep .
A 3 year old and a 6 week old is crazy !
I am constantly sleep deprived .
I ’m surprised I just did this whole interview .
Yay 2am !
AM : Many thanks for your time Jeff .
We wish you much success with your UK debut .

The new carbon nanotube filament is 100,000 times narrower than a standard tungsten filament ( Image : SAKKI / Rex Features )
The smallest ever incandescent lamp , made using a single carbon nanotube , has been created by physicists in the US .
At 1.4 micrometres long and just 13 nanometres wide , the filament is invisible to the naked eye until it is switched on .
Chris Regan ‘s team at the University of California , Los Angeles attached a palladium and gold electrode to each end of the carbon nanotube , which spans a tiny hole in a silicon chip and is held in a vacuum .
When electricity runs along the nanotube it heats up and begins to glow , releasing millions of photons every second , of which a few thousand reach the eye .
“ That makes the light relatively easy to see , ” says Regan .
“ Your eye is nearly single - photon sensitive . ”
But it would make a poor reading lamp , he jokes .

Quantum conundrum
It is bright enough , though , to shed light on one of the fundamental incompatibilities in physics – the mismatch between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics .
The second law of thermodynamics says entropy , or disorder , increases with time , but on the quantum scale time things are not so directional – whether you travel backwards or forwards in time , there should not be more disorder .
“ It ’s not clear how we get from quantum mechanical laws , which describe electrons in perpetual orbits around nuclei , to the thermodynamic laws that says it ’s going to be tough to get that wine stain out of your carpet , ” says Regan .
The carbon nanotube filament could help .
“ It is large enough that the statistical assumptions of thermodynamics should apply , ” he says , “ but it ’s also small enough that one can consider it as a molecular , or quantum , mechanical system . ”
Perfect black body
Using it , the team will investigate Planck ’s black - body - radiation law – a century - old theory that predicted how much light would be emitted from a source by assuming energy was released in discrete packets , or quanta .
Planck ’s work underpinned the development of quantum mechanics later in the century .
His law assumes that thermal radiation released from a black body – a perfect absorber and radiator of energy – will be as disordered , or as random , as possible .
For instance , a hot incandescent lamp gives off many photons of different colours which together make up make white light .
But because the nanotube filament can be considered a quantum mechanical system , Regan thinks it may not obey that law – the photons it releases may be less random that those from larger filaments .
“ Quantum mechanics is the right theory to use in systems with very few particles , and thermodynamics is the right theory to use in systems with very many particles , ” says Regan .
“ We do n’t have a theory for the intermediate regime between these two limits , so that ’s where we ’re doing the experiment . ”

Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) is delaying plans in at least two cities to start charging its Internet subscribers by how much bandwidth they use .
A Time Warner Cable rep told the San Antonio Express - News that the decision to delay the tests in San Antonio and Austin , Tex. , was a result of " consumer reaction . "
Translation : Customers hate the idea .
The cable company will try again in October , but it 's hard to see how the reaction will be any different .
While it might be fair that heavy downloaders have to pay more -- up to $ 150 per month -- for Internet access , good luck convincing people to give up the comfort that all - you - can - eat Internet subscriptions have provided for years .
Billing customers by how much Internet they use -- if ever rolled out broadly -- could potentially boost Time Warner 's revenues , especially as bandwidth - intensive Web video becomes more popular .
But the company runs a big risk of pushing its most tech - savvy customers away to competitors such as Verizon ( VZ ) , which offers much faster Internet service in some markets with ( currently ) no cap .
If that happens widely , it 's a disaster for Time Warner Cable .
Ever wondered what it would be like to get about on hooves ?
Thanks to leg extensions developed by Seattle - based artist Kim Graham , anyone can get around on a pair of lookalike equine legs .
The spring - loaded cloven hooves are an optional extra for Graham 's " Digitigrade " leg extensions .
The extensions are proving popular , with the waiting list now stretching beyond two months .
Graham told Horsetalk she is seeking the help of a fabrication workshop to speed up production .
The custom - fitted , hand - made units cost $ US750 to $ US780 , with the hooves adding a further $ US200 .
For added equine realism , you can even add some hair to your overall ensemble .
" We have a wonderful costumer who can made the additional fur costume to order , " says Graham .
The leg extensions come in three sizes , with medium fitting about 80 per cent of people .
She says it takes 10 to 15 minutes to learn to walk comfortably in them .
" If you snowboard , it takes about 15 seconds ! " Graham explains .
DigiLegs II video :
" Level surfaces are easy .
Sharp inclines are difficult and stairs are downright touchy .
" A brisk walk is best , running is very hard . "
Graham says she can wear them about five hours , but a planned improvement should allow eight hours of comfortable wear .
" A whole different set of muscles are used when walking in these .
The muscle across the front of the shin fatigues first , as does the top of the foot . "
The extensions , made from steel , steel cable , foam , and rigid plastic , weigh about three kilograms each , with the hooves adding about half a kilogram to each leg .
Wearers will stand about 35 cm ( 14 inches ) taller than normal .
Graham says it takes about 60 seconds to get in and out of them .
" It 's best to do this at bar - stool height because you are so much taller . "
" If you want a fur costume built around your leg extension , we might need to modify the design somewhat .
With our fur it takes an additional three minutes to get into and out of the set . "
Why boys are held back by girls in English and should be taught separately
Children should be taught in single - sex classes for English because boys are being held back by the presence of girls , a study suggests .
It found that many boys are left ' hiding in the background ' , and perform up to a 10th of a grade worse when they are placed in mixed lessons .
And it claimed that the more girls there are , the worse boys do .
Lagging : Boys perform up to a 10th of a grade worse in English when they are taught in classes dominated by girls research has shown
The researchers from Bristol University found that the trend was particularly marked in primary schools but may also apply in secondaries .
The study , which is being presented this week at the annual conference of the Royal Economic Society , also found that in maths and science , primary school girls benefit from being taught in single - sex groups .
However , boys do better in those subjects with girls present , suggesting there is no way of organising classes to maximise exam results for both sexes .
The report said : ' It is not possible to increase the proportion of girls for both boys and girls , implying that a mix of the genders is optimal in both maths and science . '
For the study , researcher Steven Proud analysed the exam results of boys and girls at every state school in England between 2002 and 2004 .
Most state primary schools are mixed - sex , although there are more single - sex ones in the independent sector .
Mr Proud found that , during English lessons , boys gained ' significantly ' lower scores when there were girls present .
However , it made no difference to girls whether they were taught with boys or not .
' These results suggest that it may be beneficial to teach boys in single - sex classrooms for English , ' Mr Proud said .
One explanation is that boys may feel they can ' hide in the background ' in English classes if there are large numbers of girls , he added .
' Alternatively , the class may appear to be performing at an acceptable level while the boys are left behind , ' Mr Proud said .
' An alternative mechanism could be that , since girls and boys learn in different ways , if the majority of the pupils are female , then the teaching may be focused towards learning styles that benefit girls more than boys . '
Schools minister Sarah McCarthy - Fry has suggested boys and girls should be taught separately for key subjects after expressing concerns that boys ' hog the limelight ' .
MONASTERY
Brother how art thou ?
The real big brothers in their solitude
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to exchange your lifestyle and become a monk ?
It 's a radical move by anybody 's standards .
One Cistercian monastery in Leicestershire is finding no shortage of candidates hoping to start a new life within the confines of its cloisters .
" To be a monk is to be a brother among brothers in a living and human community where friendship , mutual help and support play a vital role ...
" Such a way of life demands great generosity and renunciation of oneself ; its fruit is deep joy and peace . "
Mount St Bernard Abbey .
Life in a monastery could n't be more different from the stressful world we live in , so perhaps it 's unsurprising that the lure of a cloistered lifestyle is attracting record numbers of aspiring monks .
So why do monks renounce the outside world and how do they cope with the austerity of a life dedicated to prayer ?
Inside
Out goes behind the closed doors of Mount St Bernard Monastery in Leicestershire to investigate why it is having to turn away a growing number of applicants .
From dissolution to resurrection England once boasted 54 Cistercian monasteries , but these closed their doors when they were dissolved by Henry VIII in the late 1530s .
Today the only Cistercian monastery in England is Mount St Bernard near Coalville .
Mount St Bernard - a peaceful retreat for the Cistercians Mount St Bernard survives only because it is a relative newcomer , dating from the 19th Century .
It was founded in 1835 as a continuation of the dissolved Garendon Abbey , which provided a spiritual sanctuary between 1133 - 1538 .
Mount Bernard is unique in being the first Catholic abbey to be founded in this country after the Reformation .
Designed by Augustus Pugin , the abbey has a real sense of solemnity and simplicity , with every element of the architecture echoing the austerity of the Cistercian order .
At one time up to 85 monks slept in the abbey 's long dormitories , and spent a large part of their day in silence .
Cistercian living
The term Cistercian comes from the Latin " Cistercenses " , referring to the name of the town Cîteaux ( Latin Cistercium ) where the order was founded .
The brothers are often referred to as " White Monks " , after the colour of their habits .
Cistercian monks
The Cistercians were founded as an order in 1098 .
The order began in Citeaux near Dijon in Burgundy , France .
A total of 86 Cistercian abbeys were founded in Britain .
Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries between 1536 - 1540 .
Mount St Bernard was founded in 1835 on land provided by Ambrose de Lisle , who was keen to re-introduce monastic life in England .
The first monks at Mount St Bernard were called Luke , Xavier , Augustine , Cyprian , Placid and Simeon led by Fr. Odilo Woolfrey .
The first monastery opened in 1837 and was followed by a new monastery designed by Pugin in 1844 .
Mount St Bernard was given abbey status in 1848 , and appointed the first English Abbot since the Reformation .
Other famous Cistercian monasteries include Fountains , Rievaulx , Kirkstall and Tintern .
The only convent of Cistercian nuns in Britain is at Stapehill near Wimborne , Dorsetshire .
It has a community of 42 members .
The Cistercian way of life puts great emphasis on solitude and isolation .
The basic principle which sets the Cistercians apart was their desire to live more simply , in accordance with a literal interpretation of Saint Benedict 's Rule .
Today 's monks follow a lifestyle which has remained largely unchanged for the last 900 years , with a few differences .
They no longer sleep in dormitories , but in their own cells , enabling greater solitude and individual prayer .
However the monks at Mount St Bernard still take lifelong celibacy vows , and they are committed to spending the rest of their lives in poverty and celibacy .
Prayer , work and reading form the three cornerstones of the brothers ' lives .
Work is highly revered by the Cistercian order , especially manual labour , and much of the day is spent in sustaining the monastery 's needs .
The type of work ranges from dairy farming , bee keeping , and looking after the orchard to pottery , building maintenance and running the shop and guest house .
New monks start as postulants for six months , followed by two years as a novice , after which they take their first vows .
Their first vow is for a minimum of three years after which they can leave or choose to take their solemn vows for life .
The brotherhood " If you are going to be a Christian at all , you might as well live entirely for God . "
Blessed Cyprian Tansi , monk at Mount St Bernard , 1950 - 1964 .
The monks at the abbey have a long tradition of service to God - and one former monk , Iwene Tansi , was beatified by the Pope .
Newcomers continue to join the monastery , perhaps reflecting the desire of applicants to escape from the rat race and pursue a more spiritual vocation .
More and more monks are increasingly coming to the monastery , having led conventional lives .
Brother Michael has just taken his first vows - he's the abbey 's Estate Manager , having completed his degree in Environmental Studies .
A special calling - monks are often called to their vocation Brother Thomas used to work for Marconi on transistor development , whilst Brother Martin was formerly a freelance photographer with National Geographic magazine .
Father John - Paul has been at the abbey for ten years , and recently completed a Theology degree by correspondence course .
He took his lifetime vows five years ago , and now works as the monastery 's archivist .
Last year , he was ordained as a priest , something he dreamed of during his childhood .
" I told my mum when I was 12 that I wanted to be monk , so I got a clip around the ear and I did n't mention it again till I was 15 , by which time I 'd got involved with the local parish .
" So I went off to study for a priesthood at 16 .
I came from a Catholic family , but they were a bit shocked and surprised .
" Some were worried whether I was running away , but gradually as they 've come and stayed at the monastery , they like what I do , and they appreciate that I have my own life . "
Growing interest
The abbey currently has a full quota of 35 brothers , and has 50 applications to join the monastery every year .
It is now having to turn away applicants because there are so many wanting to opt for a monastic life .
So what are the attractions of the monastic life to those seeking a career change ?
Most have a calling or vocation from an early age .
Father John - Paul realised that he was going to be a monk when he was sitting in his class at school .
The teacher was talking about monastic life , and he was thinking about the romantic idea of being a monk , " Something just clicked and I knew , " he says .
Brother Michael also always thought that he'd become a monk , even when he had girlfriends , and has no regrets so far .
" Once you 're here , you settle into the routine .
You do n't worry about not going out and what you 're going to do in a few years time .
You live more in the present . "
The monks pray seven times daily , starting at 3.30 am
Living in the protected abbey environment is no soft option either , as Brother Michael points out .
" All the challenges you have to face outside , you have to face on the inside here too - living with 36 people who are all different , with different opinions , and personality clashes . "
" You have to remember when you come to a monastery , you 're not leaving everything behind so whatever the problem was you 're running away from , it 's still with you when you come here .
" Anyone who comes to a monastery to run away , would soon be runnning out again .
If it 's not your vocation , you just would n't survive in this kind of place . "
Father John - Paul agrees - life here is for those dedicated to prayer but monks lead very full lives , including producing a web site , working in the shop and running the farm .
" The life is austere , but it 's not a prison - it 's a joyous place .
I felt that this was the only thing going to fulfill me . "
A strict routine " We surrender our lives into the hands of God and never take them back " .
Thomas Merton .
The monks ' strict daily routine is marked by the two bells in the tower which sound to tell the monastic community when to eat , sleep , work and pray .
A life of prayer and dedication to God It 's a long day - the brothers rise at 3.15 am and start their work at 9.15 am , after prayers and vigils .
They work and pray throughout the day until 8 pm , when they retire to bed .
The monks try to be self - sufficient , running their own 200 acre dairy farm with 90 cows , and producing most of their own eggs , fruit and vegetables .
Prayer is the focal point of the monastic day .
Every monk spends part of his day reflecting and meditating on the words of scripture , a practice known as " Lectio Divina " .
At regular intervals during the day and night the monks come together to praise God in a ceremony called the " Opus Dei " or " Work of God " , consisting largely of prayers , hymns , psalms and readings .
The monks also welcome visitors to their guest house including friends , relatives and those interested in retreat or a monastic way of life - there were 5,000 guests last year .
Guests can stay up to five days , and there is no charge , although the Abbey encourages visitors to make a contribution to the running of the guest house .
Test of faith
For more than 900 years the brothers have taken their vows of poverty , obedience and celibacy .
Brother Michael contemplating a life of prayer to God But in modern times some would argue that the vow of celibacy tests the monks ' faith to its limits .
Young Brother Michael knew what to expect when he joined the monastery , " I 'd spent two and a half years already looking at the life , so I knew what I was getting into " .
" Also the vows are only for three years , which is a further preparation to see whether I want to make the final commitment to stay here for life . "
In time every monk at the abbey will end up in the monastery 's communal coffin .
The coffin comes out purely for funerals , and then is returned to the abbey 's attic .
For the monks being interred , this is not the end of their lives , but the beginning of a new spiritual journey that extends into the after life .

Any long - time readers of Wise Bread know that I like to keep up - to - date on hustles , scams and con jobs .
They change all the time , and new ones are invented daily .
A US version of the UK show The Real Hustle has been trying out some very simple but effective cons on the American public , and they ’re getting away with some serious money .
Watch , learn and stay alert .
One of these could catch you out the next time you leave the office or home , even if it ’s just to grab some quick cash from an ATM or a small bite to eat .
The ATM Hustle
Here , two ways to grab your cash at an ATM are outlined , and in both methods you never even know you ’ve been the victim of a scam .
The second version is more prevalent and has many variations as it requires no technology .
Street teams work areas in busy cities , I was victim to a version of the second one about ten years ago in London .
When using an ATM , keep your wits about you and if anything looks or feels suspicious , walk away .
The Laptop Switch - Off
Right now I ’m on the hunt for a used laptop for my wife , so this one really caught my attention .
If you ’re a fan of Craigslist , you may be tempted by a used laptop at a great price .
In this case , a $ 1000 Macbook for $ 500 .
But listen to that voice in your head , and realize that deals too good to be true usually are .
When you buy a laptop , keep your eye on the machine at all times , test it thoroughly and most important , do n’t hand over your cash until the actual laptop is in your possession .
The Café Manager Scam
This one is all about questioning authority , or in this case , never questioning it .
In most cases , we believe what we are seeing and hearing because we have no reason not to .
When a guy in a suit approaches you in a café or restaurant and says he is the manager , why would n’t you believe him ?
Big mistake .
It just goes to show how far confidence can get you ( hence , con man ) .
At a restaurant table , there should be no reason at all to hand your credit card before the start of a meal , even if you ’re ordering drinks .
And if you want to open a tab with a card , do it at the bar .
The Bag Snatch
So simple and yet so effective .
All it takes is a small distraction , just a conversation or someone asking the time , and your valuables are gone .
Never put your bag down in a busy place , or if you do , keep one foot on the handle or strap .
The Distract & Conquer Con
Here , the con artists take advantage of the Good Samaritan syndrome .
BY posing as tourists and asking for help , they ’re able to get close to people and walk away with some very nice valuables .
Again , keep these items on you , there ’s no need to have a cell - phone laying out on the table when jacket pocket will do the job just as well .
You can find many more examples of hustles and con jobs at TruTV.com , under The Real Hustle .
Stay safe and aware folks .
Hubble scientist airs opinions on future space plans
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : May 19 , 2009
With the space shuttle facing retirement next year after eight more flights - and with the program basking in the success of its fifth and final mission to overhaul the Hubble Space Telescope - one of the observatory 's senior scientists Tuesday lamented the loss of the winged orbiters in favor of new , less capable rockets .
Credit : NASA TV
Asked about lessons learned from the Hubble - shuttle partnership and the value of being able to service payloads in orbit , Leckrone said " I 'm not going to be around all that much longer , I 've had a very long career at NASA so I think I can speak fairly bluntly . "
" I think the ability of space - suited human beings , seven of them , flying in a spaceship carrying a very , very heavy cargo , 20,000 , 30,000 pounds , to low - Earth orbit , to then be able to go out in spacesuits and perform extraordinarily intricate operations ... and do it successfully , I think that is one of the most remarkable achievements that NASA has ever done , " he said .
" And it just makes me want to cry to think that this is the end of it .
There is no person out there , no leadership out there , there 's no vision out there to pick up the baton that we 're about to hand off and carry it forward .
And I think that 's just a shame , to abandon one of the most impressive , refined , sophisticated capabilities that this agency as a whole , human side and robotics side , has achieved . "
Leckrone , senior Hubble project scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , said giving up the space shuttle represents a " long - term loss of hard - won capability and costly capability . "
" If there 's a future for this agency , it 's got to be in an innovative direction like that , " he said .
" We can't just keep doing the same old thing year after year .
It 's just not as productive as it could be otherwise .
So , that 's my piece .
And I 'm sticking with it . "
NASA is in the process of completing the International Space Station before retiring the shuttle next year .
The agency 's Constellation program calls for building new Ares 1 rockets and Orion crew capsules to boost astronauts to low - Earth orbit starting in 2015 .
A new heavy lift unmanned rocket called Ares 5 is intended to boost Orion capsules and lunar landers to the moon starting around 2020 .
Earlier this month , the Obama administration set up an independent panel to review NASA 's manned space flight options , including Constellation and alternative architectures .
Leckrone said he worried that the Constellation program , facing tight budgets and demanding technical challenges , is " just plowing ahead , producing what they 're able to produce within all the constraints . "
" And my question is , OK , once you 've produced it what do you do with it ? "
Leckrone said .
" This is the way to keep human spaceflight alive , but what are the people going to be doing , except going back and forth to the space station ?
Which is a wonderful thing to do , and I hope the space station becomes extraordinarily , scientifically productive , but it is not today . "
He said if the Constellation program " does n't begin talking to their potential customer base , they 're going to end up with something that no one is interested in using . "
Leckrone said Constellation managers have not sought input from the science community in the design of the new rockets like the shuttle program enjoyed during its initial development .
" I do n't see any similar activity going on in the Constellation program , where they 're actively engaging their potential user base to get requirements that should go into their basic design , " Leckrone said .
" End of story . "
STORY GAMES : " Wuthering Heights , the RPG "
Heathcliff Earnshaw , a man with powerful emotional armor
Iron your smoking jacket , rub the cellar - muck off the Madeira , and send the livery out to fetch a gaming table and some of Mr. Foxbury 's amusing miniatures for gentlemen !
I know you think there 's nothing left for you because you will never be able to consummate your passionate love for your own sister .
But before you throw yourself from the family tower , perhaps you ought to give formalized dramatic art a try and " play a role . "
We 've already sent a letter to Naples , and the Italian embassy sent a man around to say that one of their experimental hard - crust sauce pies and a bottle of medical water are on the next Liverpool - bound ship .
Just in time !
Because this guy Philippe Tromeur in France has adapted the rules for a game called " Rene le jeu de Role Romantique " to create " Wuthering Heights , the RPG " a brilliant bit of social entertainment that will allow you and your intimates to unwind , relax , and vent your most desperate pathologies in ways better than a bottle of laudanum and a D - 4 rest roll .
Ladies , perhaps you had better retire to the drawing room ?
"
In all the rules , the male gender ( he , his , etc. ) will be used for our examples .
This of course implies the game is not suited for the feeble minds of our ladies .
T?his work deals with such themes as Suicide , Despair , homosexuality and socialism for the sole purpose of entertainment .
" The rules for this game are pretty simple .
You only have three stats : Rage , Despair , and Oldness .
Additionally , you are assigned a few random problems by dice roll before the game begins .
Problems like : " you are honest , " " you are Irish , " " you are obsessed by the occult , " " you are an alcoholic , " " you are an alcoholic , " and " you are a hemophiliac . "
You determine your character 's occupation and relationship with the other characters in your party , you put them in a dramatic situation , and then you let their various problems contribute to a boiling cauldron of desire and pain that can only be resolved through duels , murders , bafflement , rage , sudden fits of madness , and long speeches .
Fantastic things about this game : ( 1 ) .
To notice anything going on in the game , you must roll above your Despair .
The default setting for all players is to be locked inside their own feelings , unable to deal with ( or even comprehend ) reality .
( 2 ) .
To be able to tell the truth , you have to roll below your Despair .
The default for all interactions in this game is outright dishonesty .
As your Despair goes up , it becomes easier and easier to tell the truth , because you simply do n't care anymore .
Yet , the constant lies increase the Despair of others , resulting in a web of emotional torture that can only be resolved in ... ( 3 ) .
Duels !
The only way to not be constantly involved in duels with everyone in your immediate surroundings is to duel them and lose , at which point you cannot duel them again for 1d10 days .
The only way to lower your Rage is to duel , take drugs , or suffer severe emotional shocks .
And if your rage goes up too high or too fast , you must vent it with a sudden violent outburst , which will no doubt cause someone else to demand satisfaction . ( 4 ) .
If you ever gain more than 10 points of Rage or Despair in less than a week , you climb the " ladder of madness " one degree .
All characters start at " worried , " then become " troubled , " then " deranged , " then " absent " with various penalties assessed at each level . ( 5 ) .
You can always kill yourself and come back as a ghost , with a whole different set of rules .
Of course , if your suicide fails , get ready for a few days with Despair so high that every word out of your mouth is a song lyric . ( 6 ) .
If you manage to make it through a gaming session , a character that lives has a chance to lose one of their randomly - assigned problems for next time .
That 's about the only sense of resolution or satisfaction you can achieve here .
There is no victory .
There is no purpose .
You will sit down at the gaming table and kill all your friends after seducing them .
And then you will kill yourself .*** Here 's an account of a session of the " Wuthering Heights RPG " from someone who gave the game a spin with their pals : " I started the game with the idea that the players would start out at a funeral , and the player of the degenerate lord 's wife suggested that she had killed her husband for his money , only to learn he had gambled away his fortune .
We then basically all instantly decided that it would be more fun to start with the murder attempt , and we kicked off play from there .
The fishmonger arrived in time to see her poison her husband , the doctor was called in to conceal the crime ( by using his incompetence to detect actual murder ) , and the moneylender showed up to blackmail the wife .
" It 's really startling how well this played out in practice .
As the game moderator , I had to play almost no NPCs , and none of them were of central importance to the dramatic action of the story .
( I think I played some police , a barfly , and a servant girl . )
As events proceeded , the fishmonger was framed for the murder , ended up robbing graves on behalf of the moneylender , and just before he and his lover were hung he cut off her hand and threw it to him .
The moneylender ended up being transported to Australia , and the wife found a new , rich , and dim - witted lord to marry .
It was very much an " evil wins decisively " kind of ending .
Nevertheless , the whole thing was berserk , hilarious , and oddly touching . "*** You know you want to cast a die to see if you have the Rage it takes to throw yourself from a plate - glass window into a lake and fall all the way to the bottom without struggling , never to breathe another desperate sigh .
You know you want to fire a pistol at your own brother in order to steal his inheritance to pay your gambling debts .
I think the rules for this game should come standard in the back of every edition of " Wuthering Heights " instead of an afterward by Harold Bloom .
Right ?
When you imagine an island nation or floating city , you probably conjure up images of a peaceful , breathtakingly beautiful paradise where locals lounge around in hammocks , frozen cocktails in hand .
But real - life artificial islands and floating communities are far more interesting than that , from rickety abandoned oil industry communities in the middle of the ocean to a fort - turned - floating - hotel fit for a Bond villain .
Of course , there ’s luxury too , like multi-million dollar oceanic condos that double as tax havens .
Here are 12 of the world ’s most amazing man-made island dwellings .
Boat City of Aberdeen Harbor , Hong Kong
Centuries ago , the boat city of Aberdeen Harbor was a haven for pirates , and the floating city itself has n’t changed much since then despite the ultra - modern skyscrapers that have sprung up around it .
Aberdeen ’s “ boat people ” live here to escape the constraints of modern society , although many in mainland Hong Kong consider the boat city to be an eyesore .
Three jumbo floating restaurants in the harbor are a favorite with tourists to the area , who look on the boat people as quaint and interesting .
Deserted Floating City of Oily Rocks
One of the strangest cities in the world sits just off the coast of Azerbaijan , abandoned and dilapidated .
‘ Oily Rocks ’ began with a single path out over the water and grew into a system of paths and platforms built on the back of ships sunken to serve as the city ’s foundation .
It was all created to serve the oil industry , and before long , it contained housing , schools , libraries and shops for the workers and their families .
Now , only part of it remains as many of the paths have disappeared into the surf .
No Man ’s Land Fort
The Daily Mail called it a “ man- made island fit for a Bond villain ” , and it ’s easy to see why .
No Man ’s Land Fort , located off the coast of Britain , has a forbidding exterior with its towering armor - plated granite and steel walls .
The Victorian - era sea fort was originally built to fend off attacks by the French navy , but is now a luxury hotel with 21 rooms , two helipads and a heated indoor swimming pool .
It was put up for sale in 2007 but the company collapsed , leading to some drama with its former owner Harmesh Pooni barricading himself inside in 2008 .
It still has not been sold .
Sealand , Bizarre Island Micronation
In the 1960s , an Englishman named Roy Bates took possession of HM Fort Roughs , an anti-aircraft platform off the coast of Britain , and declared it the ‘ Principality of Sealand ’ .
In 1978 , the micronation was forcibly taken over by a citizen of Sealand , along with outside assistance , but Bates retook his ‘ kingdom ’ with his own armed forces and held the would - be overthrowers as prisoners of war until negotiations with foreign nations secured their release .
Sealand ’s legal status is questionable and no U.N. member recognizes it as a sovereign nation , but Bates and the rest of the Sealanders are generally left alone .
Thilafushi Garbage Island
From a distance , it looks like an island paradise in the middle of a stunning azure sea .
But , get closer and you ’ll soon see that this man-made island located a few miles from Male in the Pacific Ocean is actually a dump – literally .
Thilafushi was created to solve the problem of ever - growing mountains of trash in the Maldives and now contains thousands of tons of solid waste rife with toxic chemicals including mercury , cadmium , lead and asbestos .
Dubai ’s Many Manmade Islands
Dubai has an ever - growing collection of unusual man made islands including the Palm Islands and the World Islands .
The Palm Islands are the largest artificial islands in the world , built by Dutch engineers to cater to extremely wealthy buyers from around the world .
Even more exclusive are the World Islands , which are still in progress – they ’re laid out to create a map of the world and each of the 300 islands has a price tag of $ 20 - $ 30 million .
A number of celebrities are said to have purchased land here , including Rod Stewart , David Beckham and Tommy Lee .
‘ The World ’ Floating Luxury Community
If the real world just is n’t living up to your expectations , you can always escape to your own little world in the middle of the ocean .
If you ’re filthy rich , that is .
‘ The World ’ is a floating luxury community managed by Residensea that ’s completely independent of any location .
If you want to rent an apartment on this exclusive “ cruise ship on steriods ” , expect to pay between $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 a night .
Owning your own condo on board will set you back between $ 2.5 to $ 7.5 million .
Residents and guests enjoy swimming pools , tennis courts , a library , a health spa , a fitness center and even golf greens .
Floating Island Built on Recycled Water Bottles
If you want to live a carefree seaside life like the uber - wealthy of ‘ The World ’ , but do n’t have a lot of cash , look to Spiral Island for inspiration .
This artificial island in Mexico was constructed on a base of 250,000 plastic bottles that allow the island to drift and relocate as needed .
Unfortunately , the island was destroyed by a hurricane in 2005 , but owner Richard Sowa is completing construction of Spiral Island II .
The original island was home to a two - story house , a solar oven , a self - composting toilet and three beaches .
Kawasaki Artificial Island
Tokyo
Bay is home to a number of man-made islands including the mysterious Kawasaki Island , which is home to a large tower .
But what looks like it could be a skyscraper from afar is actually just a ventilation shaft for the Tokyo Bay Aqua - Line , which runs from Kisarazu City to Kawasaki City .
Sometimes called the Tower of Wind , this man-made island took 30 years to be completed .
Floating Island of Immortals
In photos , it almost does n’t look real : a sparkling flame - shaped mountain of steel in the middle of the ocean , which stands at sharp contrast to its organic surroundings .
But the dramatically named ‘ Floating Island of Immortals ’ is actually a sculpture by Chinese artist Zhan Wang and an integral part of the Beaufort Art Trail , a collection of international art spread out over 67 kilometers along the Belgian coast .
On the island , statues of a fisherman and an elf , a cell phone and a computer represent icons of the past , present and future .
Lilypad Floating Cities for Climate Change Refugees
So far it ’s just theoretical , but the Lilypad floating city concept is one of the most well developed ideas for a functioning sea community yet to be created .
Envisioned as a floating ‘ ecopolis ’ for climate change refugees , Vincent Callebaut ’s design resembles a water lily and would not only be able to produce its own energy through solar , wind , tidal and biomass technology but would also process CO2 in the atmosphere and absorb it into its titanium dioxide skin .
Each of these floating cities could hold as many as 50,000 people .
Autopia Ampere
Another notable ocean ecopolis concept comes from Wolf Hilbertz , a German architect who plants to use the process of electrodisposition to create a city that would essentially build itself .
Autopia Ampere would begin as a series of wire mesh armatures connected to a supply of low - voltage direct current produced by solar panels .
The electrochemical reactions would draw up sea minerals over time , creating walls of calcium carbonate on the armatures .
Hilbertz has proven that the theory is applicable in practice by growing a coating of limestone on wooden piles wrapped in chicken wire on the coasts of Texas , Louisiana and California .
The executive director of the Arizona Republican Party was charged with reckless driving and criminal speeding Wednesday after a photo radar camera caught him driving 109 mph on Loop 101 .
Brett Mecum was arrested by Department of Public Safety officers around 10:30 a.m. at party headquarters in Phoenix in connection with an April 10 incident .
DPS Spokesman Bart Graves said Mecum was driving a blue 2008 Ford Mustang eastbound on the 101 near 59th Avenue .
The camera caught him going 44 mph over the posted speed limit of 65 .
Mecum , 30 , was booked into the 4th Avenue Jail .
He became executive director of the party Jan. 1 following the resignation of Sean McCaffrey .
Mecum had previously served as the party 's political director .
The party did not respond to a request for comment .
Reports from Mingora say hundreds of people are fleeing the fighting Residents of Pakistan 's Swat Valley are reported to be fleeing their homes despite authorities rescinding an earlier order for them to leave .
A peace deal between the government and Taleban militants in the region appears close to collapse after the army said militants attacked police checkpoints .
There has also been heavy fighting to the west and east of Swat .
A major army operation against the Taleban appears likely within a few days , says the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan .
Our Islamabad correspondent says the army seems in an uncompromising mood , with the renewed violence apparently the death knell for the peace deal , which has held since February .

In other violence , a suicide bomber killed four security personnel near Peshawar , North West Frontier Province .
Police said the attacker rammed an explosive - laden car into a military vehicle .
It is not yet known who is behind the attack , but Taleban militants are known to be active in the province .
Patrols Pakistani Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain said the government was preparing six camps to cater for up to 500,000 people fleeing fighting in the region , AP news agency reported .
The town of Dargai , near the Swat border , is reported to be where at least one camp is being built .

Pakistan 's security forces are now poised to storm into the Swat district in a showdown which will end any chances of peace in the near future .
This operation is being seen as pivotal in the struggle against the Taleban .
If it fails , Swat could turn into an even bigger safe haven for militants and al - Qaeda than the tribal areas .
A Pakistani military spokesman , Maj Gen Athar Abbas , told the BBC the Taleban had violated all the norms of the peace deal in Swat Valley .
He said the Taleban had sent out armed patrols and had gone into the neighbouring Dir and Buner districts .
The army says militants attacked checkpoints and bases in four different locations in Swat , and that armed militants are openly patrolling the streets of the district 's main city Mingora .
A witness in Mingora told AP that black - turbaned militants were deployed on most streets and on high buildings , and that security forces were barricaded in their bases .
Khushal Khan , district co-ordination officer in Swat , told the BBC that residents of areas around Mingora had been told to evacuate because there was a fear that the Taleban could use heavy weapons to attack security forces .
But he said the order was later rescinded when the attacks no longer seemed likely .

Taleban spokesman Muslim Khan said that the militants were in control of " 90 % " of the valley .
He told AP that Taleban actions were in response to the army violating the peace deal .
He said the peace deal had " been dead " since the army 's recent offensive in neighbouring Buner district .
" Everything will be OK once our rulers stop bowing before America , " he said .
Washington talks
The deteriorating situation in Pakistan 's north - west came as President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai were preparing for talks in Washington on Wednesday .
Analysts say US President Barack Obama will seek assurances from Mr Zardari that his country 's nuclear arsenal is safe from Taleban insurgents and that Pakistan intended to root - out militant groups and defeat them .
Following bilateral discussions , the three leaders will come together for talks in what Washington 's envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , called " unprecedented trilateral co-operation " .
Mr Holbrooke told the foreign affairs committee at the House of Representatives that the US must provide " unambiguous " support to a democratic Pakistan headed by Mr Zardari .
Militants fought the army in Pakistan 's north - west from August 2007 until this year 's deal .
Under the deal the Taleban were expected to disarm .
The Taleban say they will not lay down their arms until Islamic Sharia law is fully implemented in Swat .
They have banned the playing of music in cars and are also using mosques to invite local youth to join them .

We ’re not a cell - phone - only nation yet , said Peter Carey in the San Jose Mercury News , but with a little “ push from the recession , ” we ’re heading in that direction .
New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that for the first time , more U.S. households have only cell phones — a bit more than 20 percent — than only landlines , at 17 percent .
About 60 percent still have both , but “ the trend is clear . ”
If you doubt how fast “ the momentum is shifting , ” said the Watertown , N.Y. , Daily Times in an editorial , look at the CDC ’s numbers — in 2003 , only 3 percent of households were cell - phone - only , versus 43 percent with only a landline .
Or you can just “ observe the number of people who walk while talking on their cell phone and who chat while driving . ”
And it ’s not just the young ditching landlines , either , said Carl Bialik in The Wall Street Journal .
The growth in cell - phone - only adults was highest in the 30 – 64 set .
Growth was also higher in rural areas and in the West .
At this rate , when pollsters call landlines for the 2010 elections , they ’ll miss 30 percent of homes , all over the U.S .
Pollsters are n’t the only ones fretting the shift , said Kristin Chambers in the Palatka , Fla. , Daily News .
When you call 911 from a landline , your location pops up .
But emergency responders worry that cell phones can only be located by triangulation , and calls are more easily dropped .
Johann Hari ’s story about Somalia and the background of the Piracy is making the rounds and rightly so .
Somalia is the ultimate failed state and it ’s people suffers terribly .
And yes , Europeans have taken advantage of the situation to rob the Somalis of their fish and dump waste , including nuclear material , in Somali waters .
I doubt , however , if we should define the acts of piracy as they occur now as self - defense .
It is not the Somali fishermen who profit from the buccaneering , anymore .
They may have been initially , but
The BBC ’s Mohamed Olad Hassan in Somalia says many of the pirates are former fishermen , who began by attacking ships they argued were “ illegally threatening or destroying ” their business .
“ Businessmen and former fighters for the Somali warlords moved in when they saw how lucrative it could be .
The pirates and their backers tend to split the ransom money 50 - 50 , ” he says .( read more )
The bosses are found to be elsewhere , too .
The profits from the piracy off the Somali Coast , some $ 20 million last year , are going to people who are increasingly not based in Somalia anymore .
While small gangs of armed men riding in fast skiffs are the dramatic face of piracy , these men are just the foot soldiers of sophisticated criminal enterprises in which major infrastructure is land - based .
The most successful pirates — those with the weapons and intelligence to pull off attacks on supertankers hundreds of miles from land — are employed by wealthy criminal bosses , many of them expatriates , and draw on information provided by paid sources inside key Kenyan maritime agencies . [… ]
Omar described pirate networks as something akin to the West ’s mafia .
Resources are concentrated in the hands of a few senior bosses , each employing “ capos ” commanding bands of low - ranking pirates .
The capos , Omar said , are former Somali army soldiers from before the civil war , when Somali troops trained in the Soviet Union .
The capos and their subordinates operate from pirate enclaves in northern Somalia , especially in the town of Eyl. ( read more )
And they reinvest in drug trafficking .
Somali pirates are investing heavily in trafficking the narcotic khat , along with other businesses , as they seek to spend big profits from ransom payments after months of attacks .
Maritime officials say at least 26 ships have been hijacked off the coast of the Horn of Africa country so far this year .
Most of them brought ransoms of at least $ 10,000 , and in some cases much more .
A lot of that money is now in the hands of pirates in the semi-autonomous northern region of Puntland .
Siyad Mohamed and his gang recently shared a $ 750,000 ransom after releasing a German ship they seized in May .
Mohamed said they decided to invest in trafficking khat , a mild narcotic leaf that is very popular in the region .
( read more )
To liken the Somali Pirates to Robin Hood is , in my opinion , a misinterpretation .
Many organisations who are now undoubtedly criminal have their roots in social injustice .
Take the very Mafia , which may well be involved in the dumping of toxic waste into Samali coastal waters .
There are stories about how they were designed to protect the Sicilian peasants as far back as the Middle Ages and the Catalan marauders .
The real origin is more likely later , but they still had lots of support by the people they purportedly protected from an unloved and alien aristocracy .
Both , the Somali pirates and the Mafia , however , profited from weak or nonexisting governments .
In the end there is nothing romantic about either of the two , they ’re just criminals .
And the Somali people will continue to suffer in a failed state , which will continue to fail as long as criminals profit so nicely from the failure .

The public option should NOT be a back - up or used as a trigger after SEVEN years , as Senators Nelson and Snowe wants it to be , if the private insurance companies fail to offer us comprehensive , affordable coverage .
Please CALL Senator Ben Nelson below at ( 202 ) 224-6551 and let him know that you do n't agree with him on using the public option as a back - up .
Tell Senator Ben Nelson that you DO NOT want the trigger for the public option , and that you want him to support a strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
We NEED a strong , robust Medicare - like public option NOW , not more of the SAME broken system that 's given us unaffordable premiums , little private insurance coverage , and rising co-pays .
Senator Max Baucus , the pet stooge for the murder - by - spreadsheet industry , seems to agree with Senator Nelson on the possibility of the public option as a " fall - back " :
Committee Chairman Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat , said the idea of treating a public plan as a fallback is under consideration .
" That ’s an option , " he said .
" It ’s on the table . "
Please CALL Senator Max Baucus at ( 202 ) 224-2651 with this message below :
Tell Senator Baucus that you WANT him to take the so - called " trigger " or " fall - back " for the public option off the table , and that you WANT the public option RIGHT NOW in health care reform , and that it wo n't be real health care reform without a strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
Yesterday , I posted that Senator Kennedy affirmed his support for the public option , and that 's a major victory for us .
He did that because he heard from us .
We have to keep up the pressure though .
We can't rest easy on this since they 'll be introducing the health care reform bill in June .
The unions are n't resting easy on this either .
They 're fighting HARD for the public option and against people like Senator Wyden who wants the Senate to pass his bill without a public option .
Senator Wyden 's pimping his bill to the GOP and so far they like what they 're seeing in the Wyden plan .
When Ken Allen , the union ’s Oregon state chair , came out of a meeting with Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) he told a gathering of fellow union members outside that the senator " wants to force everyone to buy health insurance and has no public section of his health care bill to cover the uninsured .
We pushed him very hard on a public plan and he wants to tax our health benefits . "
The union members booed .
Allen promised that unions in Oregon " will put the whoop on " Wyden to shift his positions .
Yeah , it 's time to put the whoop on !
Democracy For America would like us to report our calls to the Senate back to them , and I 'm re-posting their e-mail in full here below so you can call your senators today .
Republicans launched their first real attempt to kill the public option and it is already picking up a bit of steam among so called Senate moderates .
They call it " the trigger . "
They want Americans to keep the same broken system we have now and give the insurance industry one more chance to fix it on their own .
If insurance companies fail , the bill would " trigger " the public option – you know , like in 7 years or so .
We need to act right now .
Call your Senators and tell them that a so - called trigger is a no go .
Senate Switchboard
( 202 ) 224-3121 Suggested script : " I oppose the healthcare trigger .
Please ask the Senator to stand up against the insurance industry and the so - called ‘ trigger ’ for a public option .
We need the choice of a public healthcare option now , not more of the same broken healthcare system for years to come . "
The real fight has begun .
We need to act fast , make our position clear and fight for real reform .
Please make your calls right now .
Tell Congress we did n't vote to wait --
We voted for change .
Thank you for making your calls .
And do n't forget to call the White House as well .
Please ask President Obama to fight for us in support of a strong , robust Medicare - like public option in health care reform , and that you need him to lead on this .
Tell him the public option is the line in the sand for you , and that it wo n't be real health care reform without the public option .
CALL the White House at : 202-456-1111 and E - MAIL them as well !
[ Also , do n't forget to help support the Netroots Nation 2009 scholarships at Democracy For America ! ]
UPDATE : Just got a major news alert .
Remember those unions and how I mentioned they 're going to bat for us by pressing Senator Wyden to back off his so - called health care plan without the public option ?
Well , Senator Wyden is fighting back against our allies here .
So much for a so - called progressive Democrat .
The unions need our help here to respond to his lies below :
" First he was attacked by insurance company lobbyists , " says a female narrator in the ad .
" Now a couple of D.C. labor unions are attacking his plan , falsely claiming it would tax your healthcare . "
" It ’s not true — Wyden ’s plan gives middle - class taxpayers a break and saves them about 300 bucks a year , " says the narrator .
" Employers would still help pay for coverage , but we ’d make our own choices .
If you like the coverage you have , you can keep it or choose another plan — and every American is finally covered for life , even if they change jobs or get laid off . "
" When you ’ve got a healthcare plan that is being attacked by insurance lobbyists and some D.C. labor unions , you must be doing something right , " says the narrator .
Wyden concludes the spot himself by announcing : " I ’m Sen .
Ron Wyden and I approve this ad because I wo n’t let D.C. lobbyists stop healthcare reform again — not this time . "
Let me be clear on this .
Senator Wyden does NOT want a public option in the final health care reform bill .
The unions know this .
It 's why they 're going after him .
Can you help them out here ?
P.S. , check out the great diary by bobzimway about the importance of framing the public option here .
Pate or dog food ?
Either could be yummy .
That ’s because you probably would n’t be able to differentiate which is which in a blind tasting , according to a study scheduled to be released today by the American Assn. of Wine Economists .
Researchers provided 18 volunteers five food samples to try in a blind taste test .
Only three were able to identify the canine fodder .
“ We have this idea in our head that dog food wo n’t taste good and that we would be able to identify it , but it turns out that is not the case , ” said Robin Goldstein , a co-author of the study that is expected to be published online today .

Goldstein said the tasting demonstrated that “ context plays a huge role in taste and value judgment , ” even though researchers warned the participants that one of the five foods they were going to taste was dog food .
The five samples came from a wide price range and were processed to have a similar consistency .
The foods were duck liver mousse , pork liver pate , two imitation pates -- pureed liverwurst and Spam -- and Newman ’s Own dog food .
Eight participants believed the liverwurst was the dog food , and four thought the Spam was the culprit .
Two people identified the high - end pate as dog food , and one identified the duck liver mousse as dog food .

Hildegarde Heymann , a sensory scientist at UC Davis who was not involved with the study , said she was surprised that so few people were able to identify the dog food .
“ It is specially formulated for dogs and would likely stand out , ” Heymann said .
And it did stand out : 72 % rated the dog food as the worst - tasting pate .

Chris Morris discovers the final day of electioneering in India 's month - long marathon poll is a sweaty , stifling hot affair .
An elderly voter shows her election ink mark I have spent quite a lot of my life in hot countries .
I actually like the heat .
But I have never before been quite as sweaty as I have been in the last few days in Tamil Nadu .
It is 40 degrees plus , and ridiculously humid , and we are chasing after two of the most famous women in India in the space of three or four hours .
It is not for the faint - hearted .
Democracy is democracy .
But holding elections in this sticky summer cauldron borders on the insane .
It is a marathon , not a sprint , and I am full of respect for the ordinary party workers who turn up every time to organise it all .
' Like a punch '
These days are known in Chennai ( Madras ) as Agni Nakshatram - Fire Star - the hottest days of the year .
" Today 's meant to be the worst so far .
People have been advised to stay indoors , " says a man wiping sweat from his brow .
So out we go .
First stop a mass afternoon rally addressed by Sonia Gandhi , matriarch of India 's most famous political dynasty .
As we step out of the car the heat is a bit like a punch in the solar plexus .
Sonia Gandhi is the torchbearer of the Nehru - Gandhi dynasty
We pick up our kit and start trudging past row upon row of minibuses festooned in party colours .
There are flags and posters and people shouting .
One group dressed in matching black and red saris seem to have given up on the rally .
They are sitting in the shade having a picnic .
Not a bad decision .
As a stage finally looms into sight in the distance , the sound is earth - shattering .
I stick a microphone in my ear to the obvious amusement of passers - by .
We negotiate our way through two police checkpoints , as the crowd gets thicker and thicker .
Cardboard cut-outs
At the third , a harassed - looking security woman - sweating nearly as much as I am - shouts at my press card .
" It is utterly impossible for you to come in here , " she yells , with some finality .
" Gate 3 only . "
Gate 3 says it is Gate 5 , so we resort to begging with the most senior police officer we can find .
Another crush of people and it is back to Gate 3 .
We are in , and I am dripping .
Cardboard cut-outs of three generations of the Gandhi family - along with their regional allies - are as tall as four - storey houses .
From where I am standing it looks like Sonia is waving at me from the top of a tree .
Momentarily it is disconcerting .
" You are looking hot , " says an observant gentleman with a newspaper on his head .
I nod , and start to fantasise about the Kashmir valley in the far north , where I was covering elections a few days earlier .
It was grey and raining and looked like East Sussex in April .
We listen to speeches , we sweat a little more , and we leave early to try to beat the rush .
On the street corner a man is selling bottled water .
He has a big smile on his face .
Business is booming .
Huge spectacle Jayalalitha is one of India 's most colourful and controversial politicians
Next stop a rally at the central bus stand , to be addressed by Jayalalitha , the larger - than - life former Tamil movie superstar , who leads one of the two regional parties which dominate this state .
The crowd is packed thick along the entire length of a street and we have arrived at the back .
It is early evening now , and allegedly cooler , but I am still just as hot .
We press forward .
My cameraman Ravi is carrying his camera on his head , and his face looks like a windscreen on a rainy day .
" BBC News ? " says a voice from the crowd .
We are pushed on in a surge and I am carried bodily straight into the branch of a tree .
Eight members of a family lean over a balcony and wave , enjoying the spectacle .
We are close to the front now , and the huge arc lights are making things - if it is possible - even warmer .
Jayalalitha appears and the crowd roars , while I stew in my own juice and my squelching shoes
Some people have to be pulled out of the crush by the police into the area in front of the stage .
I wonder if the Rolling Stones are about to appear .
A man wearing a Jayalalitha mask tries to borrow my bottle of water , but it is nearly empty anyway .
Another man pressed against the shutter of a shop to my right is holding a large bunch of long Indian beans above his head .
It is not entirely clear why .
" It 's Mr Bean ! " I say to the man in the mask , but I am not sure he gets the joke .
I have beads of sweat running down the rivers of sweat on my forearms .
My shirt has gone a uniform shade of darker blue .
A policewoman on the other side of the barrier looks at me and giggles .
I can not say I blame her .
I suspect I look ridiculous .
Jayalalitha appears and the crowd roars , while I stew in my own juice and my squelching shoes .
Covering these huge elections over five weeks has been a great privilege and enormous fun .
But thank goodness they are over .
I could not have taken much more , and I suspect most people feel the same .
Except of course that man selling water on the street corner in Chennai .

The sexually explicit figurine was carved out of mammoth ivory and was given huge breasts and private parts along with a bloated belly and thighs that by today 's standards " could be seen as bordering on the pornographic . "
Professor Jonathan Zittrain at Harvard Law School has been known to refer to the Internet as " autistic . "
No , he 's not talking about your average Wikipedia editor with Aspergers who wears sweatpants to a job interview and subsists on Flutie Flakes , Mountain Dew , and old Wolfenstein ROMs .
True , there are people on the Internet who could fly themselves to Mars and back if only we had invented an engine that runs on awkward , but that 's not the point here .
What Zittrain means is that on the Internet , you do n't have a sense for what is going on around you .
Even though there are many people on the web , it 's been hard to visualize them as experiencing the same sites you do , since when you visit a website or query Google it feels like you 're the only person looking for ladyboy manga porn at that one time .
At least , I know I do , and it 's a lonely feeling .
I myself usually try to surpass this sense of loneliness by only searching for ladyboy manga porn in the company of other people , but I had to give this up too after I gave gramma a heart attack and almost ruined Christmas .
But there is a new tool out there for those people who are interested in searching what everyone else is searching for , and finding something potentially horrible or absurd about their collective fellow man in the process .
In this week 's Goldmine , the forums goons take a look at some of the funny , interesting , or absurd trends in people 's search patterns .
It 's cool , although it makes me wonder what James Surowiecki would think if he knew the wisdom of crowds was so focused on anal sex and Ireland .
Anyway , I hope you enjoy it .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I have some googling to do .
The base package ( versions 3 and 4 ) implementations of Control .
Concurrent .
QSem and QSemN ( and perhaps SamepleVar ) are not exception safe .
The proposed replacement code is on hackage as SafeSemaphore and source from version 0.4.1 is also included on this page .
Exception correctness means that the semaphore does not lose any of its quantity if the waiter or signaler is interrupted before the operation finishes .
QSem and QSemN violate this safetly .
SafeSemaphore defines MSem as the proposed replacements for QSem , and MSemQ as the proposed replacement for QSemN .
The SampleVar module in base also has the same kind of bug , but with SampleVar the rutnime error is worse because it can case writeSampleVar to block indefinitely .
The SafeSemaphore package as of version 0.5.0 has a MSampleVar module that does not have this bug .
The GHC ticket is # 3160 .
The problem with QSem and QSemN is that a blocked waiter might be killed .
This does not prevent a later signal from trying to pass quantity to a dead thread .
This quantity is thus thrown out , a blatantly leaky abstraction .
This is illustrated by the tests / TestKillSem.hs program in the SafeSemaphore package ( run with cabal test , please read the log generated ) .
The program , preceded by its output as a comment is :
--
This is run by " cabal test "
This shows that quantity can be easily lost when using a QSem or QSemN , and shows that MSem and MSemN do not have this problem .

Images : History of Sex : Middle Ages
Without the Christian church of the Middle Ages , Sigmund Freud of the 19th century would have been out of work .
Many of the deepest ideas and notions of sex that we hold today were formulated and laid down in the Middle Ages , especially by the Church ’s sometimes confused and other times severe pronouncements .
The Church had opinions and laws about every aspect of sex .
Adultery and fornication in some cases were sins punishable by death , but for a time the Church actually condoned prostitution , admitting that it was a necessary evil .
And in the early part of the Middle Ages , priests were actually allowed to marry and have children .
But despite the Church ’s overall opposition to sex , it appeared to be very interested in the subject .
Descriptions of sex acts were often described in great detail that sounded as if they were written with some enjoyment .
One wonders whether if these early theologians were just a little titillated by the subject as they wrote their long polemics on sexuality .
1 Courtly Love :
You can look , but you ’d better not touch
The Church forbade open expression of sexual desire , but the medieval notion of “ courtly love ” suggested that love and admiration could exist somewhere between erotic desire and spiritual attainment .
One writer defined courtly love as something “ at once illicit and morally elevating , passionate and disciplined , humiliating and exalting , human and transcendent ” .
Courtly love is associated with the Knight who falls in love with the married woman – or at least the idea of the pure woman .
He admires her from afar , goes to war for her , and sacrifices his life .
Troubadours , medieval singers who went from town to town , singing love songs , often represented this idea of courtly love , with an undercurrent of sexuality .
An example is a Spanish song about a young woman visiting a nearby stream :
Her adoring boyfriend meets her there :
a mountain stag makes the waters stir .
Happily in love , in love she ’s happy .
( from Song About a Girl at a Spring )
2 Adultery : Keep your pants on , mister !
For anyone serious about Christian morality , sex was not an option .
Celibacy was the ideal way to conduct one ’s life and sex was condoned only as part of a marriage .
Pre-marital or extra-marital sex was a serious risk , if you had to “ scratch an itch . ”
Priests were required to report adulterers and fornicators ( those having sex outside of marriage ) and punishments could range from years of doing penance to death .
But it was n’t just the Church that disapproved of adultery and fornication , it was also noblemen , who wanted to be certain that any children of their marriage were , in fact , their own .
One real life story of courtly love gone wrong involved King Phillip of France ( also known as “ Phillip the Fair ” ) .
He discovered that his three daughters were having intimate relations with some of his knights and had the men publicly disemboweled .
His daughters were then sent to monasteries and one of them was possibly murdered .
In reality , there was a more lenient attitude , especially in rural populations where sexual dalliances were routine .
Often the priests would try to force the “ sinners ” to marry , and all would be forgiven .
If marriage was out of the question , punishments could involve years of penance .
3 Sexual Positions : Insert tab A into slot B
The Church even dictated how you were supposed to have sex .
Anything other than the common “ missionary position , ” for example , was considered unnatural and therefore a sin , according to the Church .
The woman on top position , or entering her from the rear ( sex a tergo ) were not favored because they interfered with the natural order of male - female roles .
Anal and oral sex were sins because they could only be practiced for pleasure , not procreation , which for the purists was the only purpose of sex .
Punishments for those using “ deviant ” sexual positions could be very harsh : three years ’ penance for the woman on top and the same for both oral intercourse and sex a tergo , which was generally seen as the most sinful position … with the possible exception of anal intercourse .
These were the official ideas of the Church , but some “ progressive ” theologians began to question these ideas .
Albertus Magnus named five sexual positions and ranked them from most acceptable to least acceptable : 1 ) missionary , 2 ) side - by - side , 3 ) sitting , 4 ) standing and 5 ) a tergo .
Magnus said the missionary was the only completely “ natural ” position ; the others were “ morally questionable but not mortally sinful .
In certain situations , however , ( such as extreme obesity ) , these other positions could be not only acceptable but even practical .
4 Homosexuality : Psst !
Come into my closet , brother !
The Church ’s stand on homosexuality was bluntly stated by the Catholic theologian , Peter Damian in his Book of Gommorah .
Sodomy was defined as “ acts against nature ” and included the following : solitary masturbation , mutual masturbation , copulation between the thighs ( interfemoral sex ) , and copulation “ in the rear , ” or anal sex ( the last phrase was so upsetting to some readers , it was often left out ) .
St. Thomas Aquinas expanded the definition of sodomy to include all acts other than vaginal intercourse .
He also named lesbianism a sin .
The church began to prosecute sexual sinners in the 12th and 13th centuries .
Sodomy was punishable by death , which could involve mutilation , burning at the stake , hanging , and , in the case of priests caught in the act , being hung in a suspended cage until they starved to death .
There is , however , evidence of highly placed figures that were homosexuals .
King Richard I ( the Lionheart ) of England was thought to be homosexual ; it is rumoured that he met his wife Berenegaria while in a sexual relationship with her brother , the future King Sancho VII of Navarre .
It is also reported that he and King Philip II of France were sexually involved .
An historian of the time said they “ ate from the same dish and at night slept in one bed ” and had a “ passionate love between them ” .
5 The Fashion of Virility : Is that a codpiece , or are you just happy to see me ?
One of the most popular fashion accessories of the Middle Ages was the codpiece – a flap or pouch that attached to the front of the crotch of men ’s trousers and accentuated it in such a way as to emphasize or exaggerate the genitals .
They were stuffed with sawdust or cloth and held closed by string ties , buttons , or other methods .
The crotch was often extremely large or gave the idea of an erect penis .
The word , codpiece , comes from the Middle English word , cod , which means scrotum .
Another symbol of virility in fashion was a style of shoe called the poulaine .
These were long , pointy - toed shoes , that were also meant to suggest the size of the wearer ’s penis – the longer point , the more virile the man .
Codpieces and poulaines are frequently seen in the paintings of the Dutch artist , Pieter Breugel .
There is a portrait of Henry VIII , one of the great “ fashion horses ” of the later Middle Ages , wearing both .
Understandably , the Church did not appreciate these articles of clothing , calling them “ fashions of the devil . ”
6 Dildos : “ A size to match your sinful desire ”
There are some references to the use of dildos by women in the Middle Ages , in particular , this one in a Church “ penitential , ” a book that prescribes punishments for sins .
“ Have you done what certain women are accustomed to do , that is to make some sort of device or implement in the shape of the male member of a size to match your sinful desire ?
If you have done this , you shall do penance for five years on legitimate holy days . ”
The word dildo was not actually used until the Renaissance period , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , but one fanciful explanation of its origin was a small elongated loaf of bread flavored with dill , thus “ dilldough . ”
One writer in the renaissance period referred to the popularity of dildos imported from Italy :
You ladies all of merry England
Who have been to kiss the Duchess ’ hand ,
Pray , did you not lately observe in the show
A noble Italian called Signor Dildo ? …
A rabble of pricks who were welcomed before ,
Now finding the porter denied them the door ,
Maliciously waited his coming below
And inhumanly fell on Signor Dildo …
7 Virginity and Chastity : Jumping off the sex wagon !
The medieval Church ’s belief that celibacy was the only way one could worship God was embodied in the Virgin Mary .
In the Middle Ages , virginity would have been an ideal to aspire to , but it was rarely achieved by commoners and nobles alike .
But it was possible to become a “ born - again ” virgin .
The Church made it possible for women who not only had had sex , but who had mothered children , to confess their “ sins , ” perform years of penance and spend their remaining years in a convent .
Women who chose this path renounced their so - called role in the “ original sin ” ( of tempting Adam with the Fruit of Knowledge ) and joined what was known as the Cult of the Virgin .
Chastity has almost the same meaning as virginity .
Many believe the “ chastity belt , ” a belt worn by women over their vaginas to prevent penetration , was a medieval phenomenon .
In fact , it was an invention of the 19th century .
8 Prostitution : Looking for a good time ?
Prostitution thrived in the Middle Ages , whether it was approved by the Church or not .
In larger towns , prostitutes could practice their trade in anonymity and it was regarded as an honest and essential profession .
For a time , the Church actually approved of prostitution .
Ironically , the practice was regarded as a way of preventing adultery and homosexuality on a larger scale , so it was viewed a necessary evil .
St. Thomas Aquinas , one of the sterner theologians , wrote : “ If prostitution were to be suppressed , careless lusts would overthrow society . ”
The most respectable prostitutes worked in brothels , or “ stews . ”
Most villages had one .
In some villages , prostitutes had to identify themselves by particular pieces of clothing , such as a veil with a yellow stripe .
Women who practiced outside of a brothel were often exposed to the harsher elements of society .
Some were imprisoned , tortured or mutilated .
9 Contraception :
If the dam breaks …
Throughout the Middle Ages , the Church was more concerned with the sins of pleasure resulting from “ unnatural ” sexual acts than with the issue of contraception .
Theologians disagreed with contraception then , as now , but the Church appeared to be less concerned about it than denouncing the many other sinful practices .
Contraception was viewed as a minor moral problem , not a mortal sin .
Apart from the practice of coitus interruptus , there are some references to condom use by men .
Condoms , then , consisted of animal bladders or intestines tied with twine and were reused many times .
It appears they were used more as a way of preventing venereal diseases , such as syphilis .
Later versions of the condom were made with linen .
The first contraceptive use of the condom was not until the mid 1600s .
Women sometimes used pessaries , concoctions of a variety of ingredients that acted as a kind of spermicide .
They were applied inside the vagina .
One pessary recipe consisted of ground dates , acacia bark , and a touch of honey mixed into a moist paste .
The wool or cloth was then soaked in this mixture and inserted inside the vagina .
10 Sexual Dysfunction :
Wake up and make love with me !
If a man could not perform sex , the Church brought in a special group of “ private investigators ” – wise village women who would examine the husband ’s penis and assess their general health to determine if they were capable of performing sex for procreation ( and pleasure ) .
If the penis was deformed , or if there was some other reason he could not consummate the marriage , the couple would be separated .
Many medieval physicians in Europe were great followers of Islamic medicine .
Muslim physicians and pharmacists were the first to prescribe medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction , including drug therapy combined with diet .
Most of these drugs were oral medication , though a few patients were also treated through topical and transurethral means .

There are plenty of social , web , and technology tools to help you with your commute .
Whether you have a TomTom or constantly whip out your iPhone , you can find driving directions , locations , general traffic information , and even speed traps .
However , what Waze is aiming to do is far more ambitious .
This mobile app , which uses crowdsourcing to create driver - generated maps , is expanding out of Israel and is launching today in the U.S.
With it is a technology that gathers information on driving patterns , traffic , accidents , police traps , and more and analyzes it in order to inform the driver of the best possible route available .
Waze 's real - time technology
Waze is an application , primarily for Google Android phones , that gathers data and provides it to the driver .
Waze is able to use your GPS and your movement to determine if there is a traffic jam , an open route , or a previously unknown alleyway .
It relies on multiple data points from multiple phones to provide a full picture of the area .
As more and more users drive a specific area , it picks up on the streets , tendencies , and more to build a driver - generated map .
This map not only includes streets , but builds in models for bottlenecks and major delays ( red ) , fast routes , accidents , etc .
Users can also actively report things like a speeding camera or a construction zone in order to build a more accurate Waze map .
When you actually use the application , you can physically see where these traps , slowdowns , and areas to avoid are .
There 's even a map that shows the movement of all of the cars ( anonymously ) using the application in real - time .
One of Waze 's key advantage is real - time information .
For example , if a previous traffic jam clears up , the next car using Waze that goes through at normal speeds will slowly erase the traffic indicators from the map as they drive through it .
It also has a system to rank people based on reliability , using points .
If you 're reporting bad information , the system docks you points and your influence on the user - generated map decreases .
It provides a unique competitive and social feature while providing a way to judge informational accuracy .
Waze eyes the U.S. market
Waze has been in use for a while in Israel , but now it sets it ambitions on the U.S.
It 's starting with the Google Android platform and the San Francisco bay area , where users may be more receptive to having the application .
However , it probably wo n't reach enough platforms until it gets its iPhone app approved .
Even then , the iPhone 's inability to run background apps ( which might change soon , rumors say ) could harm Waze 's data collection efforts .
Yet if Waze can succeed with a proof of concept in the U.S. , there is huge potential .
The driving information market is huge , and there have been major acquisitions in the past - Navteq was acquired by Nokia in 2007 for $ 8.1 billion while Tele Atlas was bought by TomTom for 3 billion euros .
Waze aims to gather more information and bring it real - time .
Crowdsourcing this type of information seems like an intelligent thing to do .
Apps like Trapster already do a great job of gathering this information .
But much of Waze 's data is collected passively , making it easier on the driver .
The result could be the a full - knowledge system that knows when roads are packed and where police patrols like to hide .
If Waze can get itself on more phones in more cities , or if they score a deal with a car maker so that it gets automatically installed into cars , it has the potential to be a major innovator and player in the market .
Finally :
It violates everything we believe in as a country , " Land said , reflecting on the words in the Declaration of Independence : that " all men are created equal " and that " they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights . "
" There are some things you should never do to another human being , no matter how horrific the things they have done .
If you do so , you demean yourself to their level , " he said .
" Civilized countries should err on the side of caution .
It does cost us something to play by different rules than our enemies , but it would cost us far more if we played by their rules , " Land concluded .
In this blog post , we discuss how fact - checking has evolved to take on an increasingly prominent role in the age of social media , helping determine what qualifies as credible information .
Now , with the coronavirus pandemic resulting in widespread anxiety around the country , conditions are ripe for misinformation to spread , which has increasingly put a strain on the fact - checkers responsible for stemming the tide of false conspiracies .
In this environment of incomplete information , it is all the more important to view new information with a critical eye and , when necessary , consult the professionals .
This just popped up all over the net .

Jon Buttaci , a graduating senior who boycotted the commencement ceremony in favor of a small vigil at the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes , said : “ The Catholicism on this campus does n’t match up with what the larger church is teaching .

In his address , Mr. Obama did not engage on the merits of the debate on abortion ; he instead made an appeal to each side of the issue .
He said he supported a “ sensible conscience clause ” allowing health care providers to withhold abortion or other services that conflicted with religious beliefs .
And he recalled agreeing with an anti-abortion voter who complained that his Senate campaign Web site in 2004 had demonized those who disagreed with Mr. Obama by calling them “ right - wing ideologues . ”
“ Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction , ” he said .
“ But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature . ”
The modest protests here were amplified on national airwaves .
“ The problem here is that we ’re trivializing abortion , ” the Rev. Frank Pavone , national director of Priests for Life , said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”

Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee and a Catholic , said Notre Dame should have allowed Mr. Obama to speak but not given him an honorary degree .

The four men arrested Wednesday night in what the authorities said was a plot to bomb two synagogues in the Bronx and shoot down military planes at an Air National Guard base in Newburgh , N.Y. were petty criminals who appeared to be acting alone , not in concert with any terrorist organization , the New York City police commissioner said Thursday .
The men were arrested in an elaborate sting operation at around 9 p.m. on Wednesday after planting what they believed to be bombs in cars outside the Riverdale Temple , a Reform synagogue , and the nearby Riverdale Jewish Center , an Orthodox synagogue .
Once the explosives were planted , the men planned to drive to the National Guard base to shoot down military aircraft with a Stinger surface - to - air missile while detonating the bombs with a remote device .
The men did not know that the bombs , obtained with the help of an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , were fake , and that the missile was incapable of being fired .
In a news conference at the Riverdale Jewish Center , one of the two synagogues said to be the targets of the plot , the commissioner , Raymond W. Kelly , offered new details about the four defendants  James Cromitie , David Williams , Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen  three of whom were arraigned in Federal District Court in White Plains , N.Y. , on Thursday .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ’s plan to create one of state ’s largest solar photovoltaic plants was approved by the city ’s Board of Supervisors .
[ social_buttons ]
San Francisco ’s Board of Supervisors Tuesday passed a proposal giving clearance to Recurrent Energy to Construct a 5 megawatt solar photovoltaic plant and sell energy to the city at a cost of about $ 2 million annually .
The new plant , to be built in the city ’s Sunset District , will be the largest municipal solar power project in California .
“ Yesterday , San Francisco took another major step towards achieving our commitments to reduce greenhouse gases and grow our green economy , ” said Mayor Newsom in a statement .
Newsom , who sponsored the legislation , added that the project would more than triple San Francisco ’s solar energy production and “ help lead the state towards a future of clean , renewable energy . ”
Developing the project will be San Francisco - based Recurrent Energy .
Under the deal , Recurrent will assume initial financial responsibility for the cost of installing and operating the plant .
In return , the city incurs no upfront cost , but enters into a purchase agreement with Recurrent , buying the plant ’s energy at a cost of 23.5 cents per kilowatt - hour , plus 3 percent per year .
In March , Recurrent purchased the solar project pipeline of up to 350 megawatts from UPC Solar , a Chicago - based renewable energy development company .
The recent transaction provided Recurrent Energy with direct access to project opportunities in development across the continental United States , Hawaii , and Canada .

CAIRO  Arab leaders may be divided over which Palestinian faction to support and what to do about Iran ’s rising influence , but they have found one cause to rally around : protecting the president of Sudan from charges that he orchestrated the rape , killing and widespread pillaging in Darfur .
Arab leaders gathered for their annual summit meeting in Doha , Qatar , on Monday , hoping to patch over their many differences .
But they had little trouble agreeing to an effusive embrace of Omar Hassan al - Bashir , the president of Sudan , who was indicted by the International Criminal Court this month for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The court also issued a warrant for his arrest .
The emir of Qatar , Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , greeted Mr. Bashir at the airport with a red carpet treatment , a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek .
Even before the meeting began , Amr Moussa , the secretary general of the Arab League , said the member states would “ continue our efforts to halt the implementation of the warrant . ”
Arab leaders have closed ranks around a fellow head of state in the face of pressure from the West and condemnation from human rights groups around the world .
They have argued that the International Criminal Court compromised Sudan ’s sovereignty .
Their supporters said the court ’s action revealed the West ’s double standard in dealing with Arabs by indicting Mr. Bashir while taking no action against what they saw as war crimes committed by Israel during its offensive in Gaza .
They added that the indictment undermined efforts at bringing about a negotiated settlement by inflaming the situation .

Nebraska Punk'd Into Ugly License Plate Design
So the Nebraska design community is up in arms over the state 's new license plate design calling it " boring , uninspired and ugly . "
A site , Get Ready For Action , has been launched telling " The Story of How Gov. Dave Heineman Got Punk 'd and an Entire State Was Shamed . "
You see , four submissions were made to the Governor 's office .
College Humor saw then and told their vast audience to all vote for the ugliest of the four designs .
That design won and is now destined to become the state 's plate .
That is unless this group of disgruntled creatives can mount enough support to get the thing changed .
In addition to the website , there 's videos , images and a blog .
The goal of this effort is to " get as many people around the nation to laugh at Nebraska and the awful way our governor has handled the entire situation . "
While the group agrees the " plates are n't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things , " we offer up a more definitive viewpoint ;
It 's a fucking license plate .
Be that as it may , the group hopes to " remove the notion that we are a boring , uninspired , and ugly state . "
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Megan Cavallari looks up from her stack of hundreds of faxes and documents , proof of her efforts to try to save her home from foreclosure .
She 's been on hold for over an hour , trying to get details for a loan modification .
Megan Cavallari said that trying to get through to her bank for a loan modification was a nightmare .
Finally , she 's transferred to another line .
But she does n't get a human .
Exasperated , she sighs .
Once again , it 's the " automated lady . "
" Every report says the banks are helping , and everything on the radio says they 're helping , " Cavallari said .
" You call and call and call ; you 're not getting a voice .
You 're getting a recording . "
Cavallari , a music composer who does scores for films , is like hundreds of thousands of Americans going through foreclosure .
But she says the process of trying to save her home -- and her $ 92,000 down payment -- has worn her out .
She recently filed for bankruptcy and is moving out of her home with her young daughter .

Critics charge that 's not good enough when you 're dealing with the loss of one 's home and ruining a family 's credit rating .
Yvonne Mariajimenez , an attorney with the nonprofit Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County , says she deals every day with clients who have tried to reach their lenders .
Sometimes , people hold for 20 minutes ; in some cases , the wait is 2 ½ hours with nothing resolved in the end .
" Homeowners are calling .
They 're not getting calls back .
The waiting time is ridiculous , " she said .
" They called 800 numbers that went into a black hole . "
Her firm has worked with homeowners and banks to meet in person to try to negotiate modifications .
" That has proven to be better , but even so , they 're slow in reviewing loans and coming back with modification efforts .
" In the meantime , lenders are continuing to move forward with foreclosure , " she said .
" Even with thousands of people in foreclosure , we do not have anywhere near the advocates needed in order to deal with these homeowners on a one - to - one basis . "
Maria Quesada is a single mother who faces losing her home .
When her commissions started drying up in the insurance business , she says , she started calling her bank to work out a modified loan .
Half a year later , she 's still waiting .
She says it 's a frustrating routine trying to reach anyone with the power to modify her loan .
The responses , she says , are typically " call back in a week ; call back in three days ; call back , call back , call back . "

Michael Wise , who became a symbol of the savings - and - loan debacle of the late 1980s , committed suicide in Florida last week .
Wise jumped from the ninth floor of a parking garage at Tampa International Airport on April 8 , said Henry Poage of the Hillsborough Medical Examiner ’s office , which ruled the death a suicide .
According to the medical examiner ’s office , Wise drove a rental car to the ninth floor of the short - term parking garage .
A security video shows
Wise pacing , then he stepped off the side .
Wise landed in a landscaped area with palm trees and some greenery , said Tampa International Airport spokeswoman Brenda Geoghagan .
He was taken to a hospital but died in the emergency room at 1:39 p.m .
The airport ’s police department ruled out any foul play or accident .
Wise was chairman of Denver - based Silverado Savings and Loan , which collapsed in 1988 .
He was charged and acquitted in the failure of that institution , but he later pleaded guilty to wire fraud related to the theft of nearly $ 9 million from investors while he was chief executive of Cornerstone Private Capital in Aspen .
He went to prison for 3½ years .
Vikings ’ Williams Wall and Saints ’ Grant and Smith expected to be suspended four games
According to a report by Yahoo Sports , a federal judge has ruled that the NFL can suspend the five players that took StarCaps last season .
The five players include Pat Williams and Kevin Williams of Minnesota , Charles Grant and Will Smith of New Orleans , and free agent Deuce McAllister .
A federal judge dismissed the claims of five NFL players who had been suspended last season for use of a banned diuretic in the diet supplement StarCaps .
Among the five are four starting defensive linemen for the Vikings and Saints , including Pro Bowl defensive tackles Pat Williams and Kevin Williams ( notes ) of Minnesota and starting defensive ends Charles Grant ( notes ) and Will Smith ( notes ) of New Orleans .
All four are expected to sit the first four games of next season without pay .
Their suspensions had been blocked last season while U.S. district judge Paul Magnuson heard arguments from the league and the NFL Players Association .
The league had suspended the four defensive linemen and then - Saints running back Deuce McAllister ( notes ) last season after they tested positive for the diuretic Bumetanide , which flushes water from the body and is considered a masking agent for steroids .
McAllister is currently unsigned , but also faces a four - game suspension .
This is a massive blow for the Vikings and Saints .
Minnesota loses the backbone of its defense , while New Orleans loses its two best pass rushers .
A four game suspension only amounts to a fourth of the season , but it ’s still enough to have a ripple effect that could carry throughout the rest of the year , especially if one ( or both ) of the teams starts 1 - 3 or 0 - 4 .
Perhaps the only good news for both teams is that they now have an entire summer and preseason to prepare for not having these players at the start of the season .
The measure , expected to hit the streets soon , would allow seriously ill patients to use marijuana with a doctor 's recommendation to treat symptoms such as nausea , loss of appetite , chronic pain and muscle spasms , said Andrew Myers , campaign manager for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project .
" If we are going to fight a war on marijuana , let 's at least take the sick and dying off the battlefield , " Myers said .
His group plans to file official language for the initiative with the Secretary of State in the next few weeks in order to begin collecting the 153,365 signatures needed by July 2010 to make the ballot .
If the measure makes the ballot , it will mark the third time that Arizonans have weighed in on the issue .
Voters passed two previous initiatives to legalize marijuana for medical use .
The first , passed in 1996 , was invalidated because of a drafting error .
The second , passed in 1998 , was overturned by the state Legislature .
Since then , Arizona law has changed to forbid the Legislature from undoing voter - passed measures .
Plus , U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder announced last month that the new federal administration would not prosecute people who are using medical marijuana in accordance with state laws .
Thirteen other states , including California , New Mexico and Nevada , have legalized marijuana for medical use .
Most of those states allow patients to grow their own marijuana , Myers said .
California 's law created dispensaries where patients could obtain marijuana , but Myers said there were problems in California 's law that essentially created an unregulated industry .
The Arizona initiative would also create dispensaries , but Myers said the Arizona dispensaries would be operated by nonprofits tightly regulated by the Arizona Department of Health Services .
The dispensaries would be located in commercial areas and have to comply with strict security measures .
They would be required to grow their own marijuana or obtain marijuana through another dispensary , so that there would be no connection to smuggling organizations , illegal operations or drug cartels .
Only patients living more than 25 miles away from a dispensary would be allowed to grow their own marijuana , Myers said .
Some research has shown that marijuana can sometimes be used in lieu of more addictive opioid medications , such as Oxycotin or Vicodin .
Myers said he believes that there are thousands of ill Arizonans already using marijuana under their doctor 's recommendations , but those people risk felony prosecution .
" I do n't believe that the government should be getting in between a doctor and their patients , " Myers said .

Drink Better Beer
Dogfish Head – Indian Brown Ale
7.2 % abv
As always , in our Drink Better Beer articles we ’d like to encourage you to branch out and try more than your normal type of beer .
This time we ’re back with another great Beer from Dogfish Head and it ’s their Indian Brown
Ale , which is not your typical brown ale .
Indian Brown
Ale is a dark beer with a roasted and surprisingly hoppy scent .
It has a strong roasted coffee flavor combined with a hoppy bitterness that makes this beer stand out from all the other brown ales out there .
It also has a relatively high alcohol content ( 7.2 % ) , which is balanced by its strong flavor .
According to Dogfish Head :
“ A cross between a Scotch Ale , an I.P.A. , and an American Brown , this beer is well - hopped and malty at the same time .
It is brewed with Aromatic barley and caramelized brown sugar .
Food Pairing Recommendations : Balsamic vinaigrette salads , smoked meats , duck confit , braised ribs , venison , prosciutto , stews Glassware Recommendation : Pint Tasting Notes : molasses , coffee , ginger , raisinettes , chocolate Wine Comparable : Shiraz . ”
Dogfish Head ( described as “ off - centered ales for off - centered people ” ) was Delaware ’s first brewpub when it opened Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats in Rehoboth Beach in 1995 .
Since then they ’ve focused on making interesting beers with unusual ingredients .
In the 80’s there was a time when people were addicted to Pac - Man .
Everybody coined the name ‘ Pac - Man Fever ’ and over time a lot of people had addiction issues with the game .
Problems arose when people started spending quarters after quarters on the game and some even stayed long nights at laundromats , donut shops , and 7 - 11s just to play the game .
( sounds like WoW addiction now a days )
What better way to reach out to these sad people than shooting a celebrity public service announcement .
Comedienne Lilly Tomlin talks about her Pac - Man Fever in the video and how she overcame the addiction of Pac - Man .
Just like what she said :
“ It all starts with a harmless quarter . ”
Also , here is the hit song by Buckner and Garcia .
Thanks to MediaBurn for the vintage video .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shaped Washington 's response to the financial crisis late last year , which buoyed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other Wall Street firms .
Goldman received speedy approval to become a bank holding company in September and a $ 10 billion capital injection soon after .
During that time , the New York Fed 's chairman , Stephen Friedman , sat on Goldman 's board and had a large holding in Goldman stock , which because of Goldman 's new status as a bank holding company was a violation of Federal Reserve ...

Protesters descend on Australian army base as marksmen slaughter kangaroos to protect other species
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Australia 's army has started shooting 6,000 kangaroos to thin their population on an army training ground near the capital , Canberra , an official said today , outraging conservationists , who have vowed to protest .
The killings are intended to protect endangered plants and insects that share the grassy habitat with the kangaroos .
A much smaller slaughter , of 400 kangaroos , on another defence department site in Canberra last year was disrupted by protesters .
Civilian marksmen contracted by the department began shooting the kangaroos on Tuesday night at the Majura training area , where an estimated 9,000 kangaroos roam , Brigadier Brian Dawson said .
" The culling is intended to reduce the kangaroo population to sustainable levels , " he said , describing the action as that of a " responsible landowner " .
The night - time shooting is expected to continue intermittently until August .
The training ground covers more than 3,000 hectares ( 7,400 acres ) and includes grenade and artillery firing ranges .
Bernard Brennan , president of Canberra 's Animal Liberation conservation group , said protesters would gather at the site tonight and many more would arrive from around Australia next week .
" We 're not going to sit back and let it happen , " he said .
The kangaroo slaughter follows a government environmental report that the common eastern grey kangaroos are too numerous in Canberra 's parkland and grassland , eating scarce native grass , which is the habitat of endangered insects such as golden gun moths and perunga grasshoppers .
The kangaroo overpopulation was also threatening endangered reptiles , the grassland earless dragon and the striped legless lizard , the report said .
Kangaroos are slaughtered to control their population throughout Australia , but government agencies have been reluctant to kill the national symbol around Canberra in the last 20 years because of public protests .
In public debates about emerging intellectual property issues that relate to software , the Linux Foundation and Microsoft are often on opposing sides .
Both seem to agree , however , that a new set of guidelines authored by the American Law Institute ( ALI ) for interpreting software contract law is deeply flawed .
In an open letter that was published Monday , the Linux Foundation and Microsoft contend that the ALI 's Principles of the Law of Software Contracts is detrimental to the growth of the software industry and the open source software ecosystem .
The point of contention is a section of the Principles which states that vendors implicitly grant buyers a nondisclaimable guarantee that commercially - distributed software contains no hidden flaws .
The relevant section says :
A transferor that receives money or a right to payment of a monetary obligation in exchange for the software warrants to any party in the normal chain of distribution that the software contains no material hidden defects of which the transferor was aware at the time of the transfer .
This warranty may not be excluded .
Microsoft and the Linux Foundation suggest that this aspect of the Principles is vague , excessive , and not an accurate interpretation of law .
They also argue that a narrowly defined exception — which says that the implied warranty is not applicable to software that is made available at no cost — is poorly crafted and ignores the increasingly complex diversity of new software distribution models .
They say that the Principles are too heavily focused on the conventional shrinkwrap software business practices , which are gradually becoming an anachronism .
The ALI is not an official legislative body .
It 's an independent organization that documents well - established case law and provides written guidance on a wide range of legal issues .
The texts produced by the ALI , which are generally written in the same style as a formal legal code , are widely used as reference material by judges and lawyers .
The ALI is preparing to review the Principles draft for approval at a meeting this week , and Microsoft and the Linux Foundation have published their open letter now in order to raise awareness of what they perceive as flaws in the draft before it is reviewed .
Flawed guidelines
The implied warranty could create immense litigation for software vendors and could even make individual open source software contributors liable for defects in open source software code that is later distributed in a third - party commercial product .
The Linux Foundation argues that there are too many grey areas about the scope of the warranty and what constitutes commercial distribution .
This aspect of the Principles clearly conflicts with open source software licenses that disclaim warranties .
The resulting fear of litigation could broadly deter companies , universities , and individuals from making their source code available .
Microsoft argues that the exclusion for software that is distributed free of charge is highly ambiguous .
It 's not clear if the exclusion applies to the software as a service model or software that is made available for free but generates revenue through an ad- supported revenue model .
In the open letter , Microsoft and the Linux Foundation both argue that the ALI assertion that the warranty cannot be disclaimed is inconsistent with the Uniform Commercial Code or any other existing law in the United States that regulates the sale of goods .
This means that the implied warranty is unique to software .
Horacio Gutierrez , Microsoft VP and deputy general counsel , discussed some of the problems with the ALI 's principles in Microsoft 's official blog about legal and policy issues .
" The mere fact that the Linux Foundation and Microsoft are joining forces may be viewed by some as remarkable , given that our differences receive far more public attention than when our interests converge .
But there is a wide range of issues that affect all software developers alike , " he wrote .
" While the Principles reflect a lot of hard work and thought by the ALI , Microsoft and the Linux Foundation believe that certain provisions do not reflect existing law and could disrupt the well - functioning software market for businesses and consumers , as well as create uncertainty for software developers . "
This sentiment is shared by Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin , who also blogged about the issue .
" The principles outlined by the ALI interfere with the natural operation of open source licenses and commercial licenses as well by creating implied warranties that could result in a tremendous amount of unnecessary litigation , which would undermine the sharing of technology , " he wrote .
The fact that both Microsoft and the Linux Foundation share the same views on this issue is a relatively clear indication that it 's potentially troubling to a large segment of the software industry and could have a negative impact on software developers and vendors across a wide spectrum of business models and ideological alignments .
Their combined voice could be sufficient to send the ALI a wakeup call .

The UK 's luckiest Internet users live in Ashford , Kent .
Virgin Media announced this week that it is trialing 200 M bps cable connections in Ashford , where 100 " lead adopters " will help Virgin test and evaluate the system .
This is a real - world trial that has already escaped from the lab , but it wo n't be coming to a home near you any time soon ; Virgin plans to run its trial for at least six months before looking at the results and considering further deployment .
Virgin used the opportunity to talk a bit of smack about cable operators in other countries , claiming that its 200 M bps service " is believed to be the fastest implementation of DOCSIS 3 technology in the world , running faster than services offered in Japan and the US , which currently reach 160 Mbps and 101 Mbps respectively . "
This is true , except for the bit where Virgin appears to suggest that its 200 M bps service is , you know , actually available to more than 100 residents of Ashford , Kent .
In any event , these numbers ( 200 Mbps , 160 Mbps , and 101 Mbps ) make the DSL and fiber - to - the - home folks livid , because it's not an accurate representation of the speeds that any cable user can achieve in a real - world deployment .
( See this post by Verizon 's Eric Rabe , for instance , where he calls the cable numbers " a parlor trick . " )
Who 's right ?
A shared architecture
Users seeding . torrent files or uploading photo sets to Flickr will see a slowdown anytime the upstream link is congested , of course , but so will plenty of other users .
Both sides are accurate , when considered from Obi-Wan 's " a certain point of view . "
Cable can deliver these speeds , but it does so over a shared architecture that sees speed drop as more people use the Internet at the same time .
Consider the throughput constraints on a cable system :
Total number of users
Each node on a cable system is set up in a loop , with every home on that node ( up to several hundred ) sharing the total bandwidth .
Verizon 's FiOS also shares , but it divvies up 2.4 Gbps between 32 homes ; DOCSIS 3.0 cable systems can share around 160 M bps with up to 400 - 500 homes .
Even during peak periods , the line is filled with data only about 10 percent of the time , so the " oversubscription " model generally works well — but heavy use by many users will cause slowdowns , especially on the upstream link ( see below ) .
Bottleneck speed
A connection to a distant server is only as fast as the slowest link .
Even when the connection between home and the central office 's CMTS ( cable modem termination system ) is humming along , upstream choke points in the backhaul network , the public Internet , or at the remote server can all lower perceived network speeds .
The gear in your house
As cable 's DOCSIS data architecture continues to mature , the new high speed offerings may be too fast for some customers even to use .
As Virgin notes when describing its 200 M bps trial , " there are no wireless routers able to deliver throughput of speeds as high as 200 Mb , and computers require very high specification in order to be able handle data at such a high rate .
If a home still has a ( not uncommon ) 802.11 b wireless router , for instance , the device can only move 11 M bps under normal circumstances .
802.11g routers can move around 54 Mbps , while some 802.11n routers claim speeds in the 100 M bps+ range .
None can hit 200 Mbps , however .
200 Mbps is also faster than fast ethernet ( 100 Mbps ) , still common in plenty of home PCs tucked in dens , bedrooms , and basements across the country .
These machines can never access 200 M bps speeds — and in fact wo n't even get 100 M bps speeds thanks to network overhead .
In addition , the cable modem needs to be fast enough to handle the new speeds , and customer wiring in the home needs to be able to support 100 M bps + speeds reliably .
Your DOCSIS profile
When a cable modem is attached to the local loop , it contacts the CMTS and downloads the customers DOCSIS profile .
The profile provides all sorts of variables to the modem , including the maximum upstream speed that it can send data ( downstream speed to each modem is limited by the CMTS itself to avoid flooding the wire with data ) .
Cable operators can change this remotely to fix problems or allow more speeds ; " enterprising " customers have also attempted to hack their devices to go faster than their pay tier .
The CMTS can detect modems transmitting faster than their allowed rate and issue a hard bandwidth limit to such devices to prevent flooding the upload link with data .
Cable plant noise
Noise is the enemy of data , and cable lines can be full of it .
Cable modems operate at different power levels in order to overcome any noise on the line that might interfere with transmission .
The problem could be inside the house , where it 's the customer 's problem , or in the local node .
Either way , too much noise degrades speeds and makes for a miserable experience .
Severe upstream congestion .
Even with the new DOCSIS 3.0 , upstream bandwidth is quite limited in cable systems .
When shared between an entire neighborhood , this can cause speed problems — and not just for uploads .
( This is why Comcast 's P2P blocking system only targeted the upload link . )
Users seeding . torrent files or uploading photo sets to Flickr will see a slowdown anytime the upstream link is congested , of course , but so will plenty of other users .
TCP , the most common protocol on the Internet , relies on a stream of acknowledgements to make sure that data is arriving accurately at its destination .
In the case of a severely overloaded uplink , such acknowledgements may be delayed , which can in turn affect a user 's downloads .
( This does not apply to " fire and forget " protocols like UDP . )
An overloaded CMTS
The CMTS in your cable company 's local office terminates all the local loops and connects them to the cable company 's backhaul network .
Like a giant router , a CMTS must keep up with the tremendous packet flows that it sees ; if for some reason it cannot , performance degrades .
A CMTS can be badly configured , thereby using too much processor time .
It can also be loaded down running management functions and reports , or it might simply be handling a huge number of packets .
Cisco , a CMTS maker , notes that in scenarios where CMTS processor usage runs above 80 percent during peak times , " end users may start to experience slower performance and increased latency . "
DSL , fiber : we do n't share ( as much )
DSL and fiber share some of these issues , of course .
With DSL , for instance , line noise can be a tremendous problem .
But providers are publicly more concerned with that big number — 101 Mbps ! 200 Mbps !—even if customers will never see those speeds .
While cable 's shared architecture means that users simply can't get anything like the peak 160 Mbps or 200 Mbps , speeds can remain surprisingly high
DSL is not a shared architecture in the last mile ; each DSL link runs over dedicated copper from a DSLAM port in the local office to a customer 's home .
The whole office must be connected to a backhaul network , though , which is generally fiber , and problems can crop up here if a central office is underprovisioned .
Speeds are typically less variable than with cable , but they do n't " sound " as fast , either .
Fiber also shares , but with far fewer homes than cable .
It also offers tremendous bandwidth now , with the possibility of more in the future as new wavelengths are added to the fiber .
But no one shares like cable , and that 's why some of these speed numbers need to be considered carefully .
When Cablevision in the US offers 101 Mbps to customers but a DOCSIS 3.0 connection tops out at under 160 M bps — well , it 's clear that customers wo n't get anything like 101 M bps during peak times .
Similarly , Virgin 's talk of 200 M bps connections is likewise about the total shared bandwidth on each local loop .
Still , traffic provisioning has gotten better in the last years , and cable can address local issues by splitting nodes .
While cable 's shared architecture means that users simply can't get anything like the peak 160 Mbps or 200 Mbps , speeds can remain surprisingly high .
Most people , even when " using " their Internet connection , are n't actually using their Internet connection — especially when browsing the web , a notoriously " bursty " activity .
Oversubscription is the same technique used by airlines to sell seats on planes , since they know that some percentage of passengers wo n't show up .
The difference is that , if too many people do arrive , the airline hands out vouchers ; cable just hands out lower speeds .

What 's the magical formula to achieve your weight goals ?
Everyone is looking for the easy diet or pill to lose extra pounds .
With all the media hype about new products and diets , it 's easy to forget the basics .
Weight maintenance is really a simple matter of energy balance .
Energy balance is achieved when " energy in " is equivalent to " energy out " .
" Energy in " comes from food you consume each day , whereas " energy out " is the number of calories you expend each day .
Eating fewer calories than you expend results in weight loss , whereas consuming more than you expend results in weight gain .
Three factors that have an impact on your energy expenditure are :
Basal metabolic rate - the number of calories the body needs to maintain body functions while at rest .
Thermic effect of food - the number of calories required to digest , absorb , transport , and store food .
Physical activity - the number of calories expended during daily activity , lifestyle and exercise .
Is there anything you can do about it ?
Are there things you can do to help boost your body 's calorie - burning power ?
Let 's try to figure it out .
1 Factors Affecting Thermic Effect of Food You Eat
Thermic effect of food ( TEF ) is the energy you use to eat , digest and metabolize food .
Diet induced thermogenesis is different for each nutrient and represents about 10 % of the total amount of energy ingested over 24 hours .
Fats have thermic effect approximately 3 % .
Dietary fat is very easy to process .
Carbohydrates induced thermogenic response is about 7 % .
Proteins are hard to process .
Protein is the most thermogenic nutrient , with the thermic effect close to 30 % .
Regular eating habit
There is good evidence that frequency of food intake has effects on metabolism and therefore very likely in the long term on weight , all other things being equal .
Studies have found that irregular meal frequency may lead to obesity over time .
Researchers who compared the effect of eating anywhere from three to nine meals per day and regularly eating six times per day found that irregular patterns produced a lower TEF12 .
Hot spicy foods
Hot spicy foods can really spice things up .
These thermogenic herbs and spices are : chili pepper , horseradish , mustard , cinnamon , fennel seed , garlic , ginger , ginseng , guarana , and turmeric .
Some studies have shown hot pepper and very spicy foods can increase metabolism by about 20 % for about 30 minutes .
A study9 in 2003 evaluated 10 Thai women and their glucose response after a glucose drink and their metabolic rate with and without 5 g of fresh chili pepper .
The chili pepper increased the metabolic rate above resting metabolic rate .
There was also an immediate increase of 20 percent in the metabolic rate within a few minutes of taking the chili pepper .

Protein
Protein has recently received a lot of attention with new research showing its satiating ability as well as its thermogenic fat burning characteristics .
There is clear evidence8 that protein exerts an increased thermic effect when compared to fat and carbohydrate .
A main reason for the difference may be due to the fact that the body has no storage capacity for protein .
The increased amount of energy attributable to this thermic effect is probably too small to have a visible effect on weight loss in the short term , but over periods of months or years , this difference may become significant , both clinically and statistically .
Evidence is also convincing that higher protein diets increase satiety when compared to lower protein diets .
The Danish researchers conducted a four - day study6 comparing the effects of pork - meat protein , soy protein and carbohydrates on a 24 - hour energy expenditure with young , healthy , overweight and mildly obese men .
Researchers found that substituting 17 - 18 % of the carbohydrate energy with pork meat or soy protein produced 3 percent higher 24 - hour energy expenditure .
The animal protein in the pork meat produced 2 percent higher 24 - hour energy expenditure than the soy protein .
Another study7 looked for differences in thermogenesis and macronutrient oxidation between lean and obese women .
Lean and obese women were studied on two occasions , one week apart .
In one visit , they consumed a protein - rich meal ; in the other visit , a fat - rich meal .
The two meals were isocaloric , of equal volume and given in random order .
Thermogenesis was not significantly different between lean and obese women .
However it was significantly higher , by almost three - fold , after consumption of the protein - rich meal in comparison with the fat - rich meal in both study groups .
Amazing Water thermogenic effect
Drink lots of water !
You 've heard it so many times , is n't it ?
But now comes scientific evidence that water drinking really does help you to boost your metabolic rate - the rate at which calories are burned .
Drinking water increases the rate at which the body burns calories .
The impact is modest , but the researchers say their preliminary findings could have important implications for weight - control programs .
German scientists1 tracked energy expenditures among 7 men and 7 women who were healthy and not overweight .
After drinking approximately 17 ounces of water , the metabolic rates of participants increased by 30 % for both men and women .
The increases occurred within 10 minutes of water consumption and reached a maximum after about 30 to 40 minutes .
The researchers estimate that over the course of a year , a person who increases water consumption by 1.5 liters a day would burn an extra 17,400 calories , for a weight loss of approximately five pounds .
They note that up to 40 % of the increase in calorie burning is caused by the body 's attempt to heat the ingested water .
Recent study demonstrated , that this thermic effect is not seen with ingestion of salt - containing fluids .
Scientists suggest that the water - drinking induced increase of energy expenditure may be explained by stimulation of osmosensitive structure5 .
The world 's healthiest drink - Green Tea
There is strong evidence that green tea has thermogenic properties ( boosting the number of calories used by the body ) and promotes weight loss , especially when combined with increased physical activity and a healthy diet .
Both caffeine and catechin polyphenols in green tea aid in stimulating the metabolism .
Green tea thermogenic effect cannot be completely attributed to its caffeine content because the effect of green tea is greater than an equivalent amount of caffeine4 .
Green tea polyphenols are known to promote weight loss by increasing the metabolism of fats by the liver ( thermogenic effect ) , inhibiting lipase ( fat absorption enzyme ) in the digestive tract , and providing a feeling of satiety and fullness3 .
Recent high - quality study2 demonstrated that green tea can reduce body weight in obese persons by increasing energy expenditure and fat oxidation .
2 Factors Affecting Basal Metabolic Rate
Basal Metabolic Rate ( or resting metabolic rate ) is the minimal caloric requirement needed to maintain all your internal physiological functions at complete rest .
This is the amount of energy your body would burn if you slept all day ( 24 hours ) .
Basal Metabolic
Rate accounts for approximately 65 - 70 % of your total daily calorie needs , but this figure varies due to different factors .
Let 's look at several key factors that affect BMR :
Body composition ( Muscle - to - Fat Ratio )
Body composition is important factor which determines rate of metabolism .
Body composition is the difference between total lean weight compared to fat weight .
It is a simple fact that muscle burns more calories than fat does - even while at rest .
Muscle tissue is about 8 times more metabolically demanding than fat .
A higher percentage of lean body weight ( muscles ) results in a higher metabolism ( i.e. energy expenditure ) compared to individuals of the same weight with a lower percentage .
An interesting point is the fatter person will burn almost the same amount of calories during exercise but the leaner person burns more calories at rest .
Age
In youth , the BMR is higher .
As we age , our calorie needs decrease .
On average it drops 2 % each decade .
After 30 years of age there is usually a gradual decline in lean body weight and an increase in fat weight although this is mainly due to hormonal changes .
A decline in our metabolic rate can also be attributed to a gradual change in lifestyle which is one thing we can control .
It is interesting to note that regular exercise in adulthood will slow the rate at which lean weight is lost and help keep an optimum metabolism .
When it comes to aging and muscle loss , " if you do n't use it , you 're going to lose it . "
So , use it !
Body size and weight
The more weight you carry , the faster your metabolism is likely running .
The fact is that the extra weight causes your body to work harder just to sustain itself at rest , so in most instances , the metabolism is always running a bit faster .
That 's one reason it 's almost always easiest to lose weight at the start of a diet , and harder later on .
When you are very overweight your metabolism is already so high that any small cut in calories will result in an immediate weight loss .
Then , when you lose significant amounts of body fat and muscle , your body needs fewer calories to sustain itself .
That helps explain why it 's so easy to regain weight after you have worked to lose it .
Dieting , Fasting , Starvation
Dieting , fasting , or malnutrition all result in a lowering of BMR .
When you restrict calories too low your metabolism slows down .
Your body slows down in order to adapt to the lower calorie intake so it can function with less fuel .
And , it actually begins holding on to every calorie you eat and storing it as fat .
This is why people who diet , usually gain back their weight once they start eating normally again .
The negative effect of dieting on metabolic rate can be offset with a positive effect from increased physical activity .
Weather or environmental temperature
Both the heat and cold raise the BMR .
If we are too cold we shiver .
Shivering burns up much energy from the constant contraction and relaxation of muscle cells trying to produce heat to maintain body temperature .
When we are hot we also burn more energy through the process of sweating .
Psychological state , stress
Stress hormones can raise the BMR .
Stress and anxiety can cause a rapid increase in energy expenditure .
When a person is in state of high alert , stress hormones circulate the blood and communicate to cells to break down energy stores ready to provide a greater supply of energy if needed .
Thyroid hormone thyroxine
The thyroid hormone thyroxine regulates the basal metabolic rate .
People with an under - active thyroid gland tend to be sluggish and overweight .
Genes
Some people have a naturally faster metabolism .
Gender
Generally , men have faster metabolisms than women because they tend to be larger and have less body fat .
Growth
Children and pregnant women have higher BMR's .
Fever
Fevers can raise the BMR .
So what factors can you control ?
Build lean body mass .
People who have more muscles on their bodies burn more calories just sitting or sleeping than people who have more fat on their bodies .
Avoid restrictive diets .
Your body slows down in order to adapt to the lower calorie intake
3 Energy Expended During Daily Activity
Physical activity includes the calories you spend during normal daily activities ( such as walking , driving , or household chores ) as well as the calories you spend during purposeful exercise sessions ( like jogging , swimming , and resistance training ) .
The calories burned in physical activity varies widely , but it usually accounts for about 20 - 30 % of the total daily calorie needs .
Exercise is a key ingredient to increase metabolism .
The aerobic workouts burn more calories in the short term , and weight training builds the muscles that will boost your metabolism in the long run .
During heavy physical exertion , the muscles may burn through as much as 3,000 kJ ( 717 kcal ) per hour .
Energy used during exercise is the only form of energy expenditure that you have any control over .
Other important things to consider for permanent results
Slow down when eating .
It takes 10 - 20 minutes for your brain to get the message from your stomach that you 've had enough to eat .
If you eat too fast , you 'll exceed your calorie needs before you even realize you 're full !
4 Fiberous Foods
Dietary fiber is a group of very complex carbohydrates - found mostly in plants - whose chemical structure prevents them from being digested by humans .
Although some metabolism of fiber ( by certain bacteria ) occurs in the intestines , we lack the digestive enzymes needed to break down the bonds that hold together fiber 's sugar units .
Therefore , fiber cannot be converted to glucose and contributes no calories to our diet .
Most dietary fiber passes through the intestinal tract undigested .
Fiber helps you to feel full longer without adding calories , so fiber helps you to lose weight and maintain that weight loss .
Eating enough fiber will also help to control blood sugar and will keep your energy levels high .
High fiber foods :
Vegetables : asparagus , artichoke , beets , broccoli , brussels sprouts , carrots , cauliflower , green peas , spinach , turnip , celery
Fruits : apple , apricot , fig , orange , peach , pear , plum , prune , raspberries , strawberries , mango , date
Legumes : black beans , black - eyed peas , kidney beans , lentils , pinto beans , navy beans
Grains : barley , wheat bran , oatmeal , brown rice
Nuts and seeds : sunflower seeds , almonds , pistachio nuts
5 Apples & Pears
Although apples and pears are not " metabolism boosters " in the literal sense , these fruits are worthy of notice as may really aid in weight loss .
The evidence supporting the use low - energy - dense fruits for weight loss comes from clinical interventions .
Brazilian researchers , studying the impact of fruit intake on weight loss , found that overweight women who added just three apples or three pears a day to their diet lost more weight on a low - calorie diet than women who added oat cookies11 .
All groups consumed exactly the same calories , with a diet consisting of 55 % carbohydrates , 15 % protein and 30 % fat .
6 Satiety index
Satiety index determines the ability of specific foods to create satiety , a feeling of fullness .
" Satiety Index " diet concept was developed by Australian researcher Dr. Susanne Holt at the University of Sydney10 .
It was developed by having participants come in the morning and eat 240 - calorie portions of a specific food .
Then they rated their feelings of hunger every 15 minutes , and over the next two hours , participants could eat as much as the liked , all under the observation of researchers .
Why should you care about the satiety index ?
Some foods fill your stomach faster and / or remain in your stomach longer , and therefore do a better job of holding off hunger .
Using white bread as the baseline of 100 , researchers scored 38 different foods that were given to the participants .
Foods scoring higher than 100 were judged to be more satisfying than white bread , while those under 100 were less satisfying .
Foods that have a higher satiety index keep hunger down longer , and would be better choices for those who want to lose weight .
All are compared to white bread , ranked as " 100 " Bakery Products Croissant 47 Cake 65 Doughnut 68 Cookies 120 Crackers 127 Snacks and Confectionar Peanuts 84 Yoghurt 88 Crisps 91 Ice cream 96 Jellybeans 118 Popcorn 154 Breakfast Cereals Muesli 100 Honeysmacks 132 All Bran 151 Porridge / Oatmeal 209 White bread Carbohydrate Rich Foods 100 French fries 116 White pasta 119 Brown Rice 132 White rice 138 Grain bread 154 Brown pasta 188 Potatoes 323 Protein Rich Foods Lentils 133 Cheese 146 Eggs 150 Baked beans 168 Beef 176 Fish 225 Fruits Bananas 118 Grapes 162 Apples 197 Oranges 202

It turns out , the more fibre , protein and water a food contains , the longer it will satisfy .
Ironically , the tastiest foods — those high in sugar and fat , like sweet bakery products — were the least satiating .
Bottom Line
For permanent success , you need to make small , healthy changes in your eating and activity patterns that you can live with forever .

Captive Knowledge
The funding for academic research has been taken over by business
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 12th May 2009
Why is the Medical Research Council run by an arms manufacturer ?
Why is the Natural Environment Research Council run by the head of a construction company ?
Why is the chairman of a real estate firm in charge of higher education funding for England ?
Because our universities are being turned by the government into corporate research departments .
No longer may they pursue knowledge for its own sake : now the highest ambition to which they must aspire is finding better ways to make money .
At the end of last month , unremarked by the media , a quiet intellectual revolution took place .
The research councils , which provide 90 % of the funding for academic research in Britain ( 1 ) , introduced a new requirement for people seeking grants : now they must describe the economic impact of the work they want to conduct .
The councils define impact as the “ demonstrable contribution ” that research can make to society and the economy ( 2 ) .
But how do you demonstrate the impact of blue skies research before it has been conducted ?
The idea , the government says , is to transfer knowledge from the universities to industry , boosting the UK ’s economy and helping to lift us out of recession .
There ’s nothing wrong , in principle , with commercialising scientific discoveries .
But imposing this condition on the pursuit of all knowledge does not enrich us ; it impoverishes us , reducing the wonders of the universe to figures in an accountant ’s ledger .
Picture Charles Darwin trying to fill out his application form before embarking on the Beagle .
“ Explain how the research has the potential to impact on the nation ’s health , wealth or culture .
For example : fostering global economic performance , and specifically the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom …
What are the realistic timescales for the benefits to be realised ?
” ( 3 ) If Darwin had been dependent on a grant from a British research council , he would never have set sail .
The government insists that nothing fundamental has changed ; that the Haldane Principle , which states that the government should not interfere in research decisions , still holds .
Only the research councils , ministers say , should decide what gets funded .
This is humbug of the same species as newspaper proprietors use .
Some of them insist that they never interfere in the decisions their newspapers make .
But they appoint editors who share their views and know exactly what is expected of them .
All the chairmen of the five research councils funding science ( 4 ) , and the chairs of the three higher education funding councils ( 5 ) ( which provide core funding for universities ) are or were senior corporate executives .
These men are overseen by the minister for science and innovation , Lord Drayson .
Before he became a minister , Paul Drayson was the chief executive of a pharmaceutical company called PowderJect .
He was involved in a controversy that many feel symbolises the absence of effective barriers between government and commerce .
On 30th November 2001 , the British government decided to buy large quantities of a variant of the smallpox vaccine called the Lister strain .
The only company which possessed enough of it was a firm called Bavarian Nordic .
On December 6th 2001 , Paul Drayson was among a small group of businessmen who took breakfast with the then prime minister , Tony Blair .
At around the same time , Drayson gave a donation of £ 50,000 to the Labour party .
Soon afterwards , government officials sought to buy the vaccine from Bavarian Nordic .
They were told that they were too late : PowderJect had just bought the exclusive distribution rights for the UK ( 6 ) .
So the government had to buy it from Drayson ’s company .
It paid PowderJect £ 32 m : £ 20 m more than PowderJect had paid Bavarian Nordic ( 7 ) .
The prime minister ’s office and Paul Drayson both refused to answer questions about whether the Lister strain was discussed at the breakfast in Downing Street .
It is not clear whether Lord Drayson was aware at that time of the government ’s decision to choose the Lister strain .
Drayson doubtless rubs along well with the chairman of the Medical Research Council , Sir John Chisholm .
Chisholm founded a military software company before becoming head of the government ’s Defence Research Agency .
He was in charge of turning it into the commercial company QinetiQ , through a privatisation process which was completed while Lord Drayson was minister for defence procurement .
During this process , Sir John paid £ 129,000 for a stake in the company .
Its value rose to £ 26 m when QinetiQ was floated ( 8 ) .
The former managing director of the Defence Research Agency described this as “ greed of the highest order ” ( 9 ) .
Lord Gilbert , a former minister of defence procurement , remarked that “ frankly the money made by the leading civil servants was obscene . …
They did not contribute anything to the turnaround of the company , it was the work of the research staff that made the difference .
” ( 10 ) Sir John Chisholm remains chairman of QinetiQ .
Is there anyone outside government who believes that these people should be overseeing scientific research in this country ?
In March Lord Drayson told the Royal Society that “ the science budget is safe … there will be no retreat from pure science . ” ( 11 ) A month later , this promise was broken , when the budget transferred £ 106 m from the research councils “ to support key areas of economic potential ” ( 12 ) : which means exchanges of staff and research with industry ( 13 ) .
Science policy in the United Kingdom is now governed by the Sainsbury Review , which the government says it will implement in full .
It was written by the Labour donor , former science minister and former supermarket chief executive Lord Sainsbury .
The research councils , the review says , should “ be measured against firm knowledge transfer targets ” to show that they are turning enough science into business ( 14 ) .
They have been told to fund £ 120 m of research in collaboration with industry .
This has been topped up with £ 180 m from the regional development agencies ( 15,16 ) .
The government is also spending £ 150 m a year “ to change the culture in universities : boosting the work they do with a whole range of businesses and increasing commercial activity . ” ( 17 ) All this is another covert bail - out , relieving companies of the need to fund their own research .
The economic impact summaries they now have to write ensure that all researchers will be aware that the business of the universities is business .
As the government ’s white paper points out , universities are already “ providing incentives ( for example promotion assessment ) ” to persuade researchers to engage with business ( 18 ) .
If your research does n’t make someone money , you ’re not likely to get very far .
Even judged by its own objectives , this policy makes no sense .
The long - term health of the knowledge economy depends on blue skies research that answers only to itself : when scientists are free to pursue their passions they are more likely to make those serendipitous discoveries whose impacts on society and the economy are both vast and impossible to predict .
Forced to collaborate with industry , they are more likely to pursue applications of existing knowledge than to seek to extend the frontiers of the known world .
But knowledge is not just about impacts .
It is about wonder and insight and beauty .
Much of it might never have an application , but it makes the world a richer place , in ways which the likes of Lord Drayson would struggle to perceive .

Humans create memories of locations in physical or virtual space as they move around – and it all shows up on brain scans .
Researchers tracked brain activity related to " spatial memory " as volunteers moved about inside a virtual reality setup .
Their new study challenges previous scientific thinking by showing that memories are recorded in regular patterns .
" Surprisingly , just by looking at the brain data we could predict exactly where they were in the virtual reality environment , " said Eleanor Maguire , a neuroscientist at the University College London in the U.K .
" In other words , we could ' read ' their spatial memories . "
Maguire and her colleagues focused on the hippocampus , or a small part of the brain that deals with navigation , memory recall and imagining future events .
Neurons known as " place cells " activate in the hippocampus and inform people of where they are as they move around .
The researchers used an fMRI scanner to detect blood flow changes in the brain , and study the activity of the place cells as a volunteer controlled movement inside the virtual environment .
They then ran the results through a computer algorithm developed by Demis Hassabis , another neuroscientist at University College London .
Earlier studies with rats had also focused on the hippocampus and measured activity at the level of dozens of neurons at most .
But that research had suggested that the brain did not record memory in any sort of regular pattern – a trend that this latest study may overturn .
Maguire and Hassabis examined thousands of neurons as opposed to just dozens , which allowed them to pick out broader patterns .
" By looking at activity over tens of thousands of neurons , we can see that there must be a functional structure – a pattern – to how these memories are encoded , " Maguire said .
" Otherwise , our experiment simply would not have been possible to do . "
Mind - reading research has grown increasingly sophisticated over the years .
Another recent study predicted people 's preference for one of two drinks with 80 percent accuracy .
And earlier findings showed that people 's brains reflect abnormal activity up to half a minute before making errors .
The latest findings on memory could lead to many more studies that examine how actual memories end up encoded across our brain cells , Maguire said .
She and Hassabis want to look beyond spatial memories to see if brain scans can pick up patterns in our memories of the past , as well as visions of the future .
Such work could also have clinical implications for understanding diseases that attack memory .
" Understanding how we as humans record our memories is critical to helping us learn how information is processed in the hippocampus and how our memories are eroded by diseases such as Alzheimer 's , " added Demis Hassabis .
The new survey also shows that nearly half of voters ( 46 % ) believe marijuana use leads to use of harder drugs .
Thirty - seven percent ( 37 % ) do not see marijuana as a " gateway " drug .
Patterns in progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood are strikingly regular .
Because it is the most widely used illicit drug , marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug most people encounter .
Not surprisingly , most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first .
In fact , most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana -- usually before they are of legal age .
…
There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs .
This evidence supports what ’s known as the common liability model , an emerging theory that states the likelihood that someone will transition to the use of illegal drugs is determined not by the preceding use of a particular drug but instead by the user ’s individual tendencies and environmental circumstances .
“ The emphasis on the drugs themselves , rather than other , more important factors that shape a person ’s behavior , has been detrimental to drug policy and prevention programs , ” Dr. Tarter said .
“ To become more effective in our efforts to fight drug abuse , we should devote more attention to interventions that address these issues , particularly to parenting skills that shape the child ’s behavior as well as peer and neighborhood environments . ”
More than 100 million Americans have tried marijuana ; 14.4 million Americans are estimated to be " past - month " users .
Yet there are only an estimated 2,075,000 " past - month " users of cocaine and 153,000 " past - month " users of heroin .
[ DrugWarFacts ]
Alternatively , experience with and subsequent access to cannabis use may provide individuals with access to other drugs as they come into contact with drug dealers .
This argument provided a strong impetus for the Netherlands to effectively decriminalize cannabis use in an attempt to separate cannabis from the hard drug market .
This strategy may have been partially successful as rates of cocaine use among those who have used cannabis are lower in the Netherlands than in the United States . "
The surging debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana has brought with it the resurrection of the " gateway theory , " which alleges that experimenting with marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs like cocaine , heroin and methamphetamine .
The gateway debate was reborn last week , thanks to a video of FBI director Robert Mueller testifying before Congress that marijuana should be illegal because it leads to more dangerous drug use .
Although the Mueller video has provoked amusement on pot-friendly websites , the unfortunate reality is that the " gateway drug " stigma continues to present an impediment to the reform of marijuana laws .
A new Rasmussen poll found that a large percentage of Americans believe the gateway argument :
Revealingly , the percentage who opposed marijuana legalization and the percentage who believed in the gateway theory were identical , both coming in at exactly 46 % .
As we look for ways to persuade those who remain opposed to marijuana reform , it 's clearly in our interest to work towards demolishing the pernicious gateway theory once and for all .
Let 's take a look at what the data shows .
In 1999 , drug czar Barry McCaffrey commissioned a major study on medical marijuana conducted by the venerable Institute of Medicine , which included an examination of marijuana 's potential to lead to other drug use .
In simple terms , the researchers explained why the gateway theory was unfounded :
In 2006 , the University of Pittsburgh released a more thorough study in which researchers spent 12 years tracking a group of subjects from adolescence into adulthood and documented the initiation and progression of their drug use .
The researchers found that the gateway theory was not only wrong , but also harmful to properly understanding and addressing drug abuse :
Of course , the simplest refutation of the gateway theory is the basic fact that most marijuana users just do n't use other drugs .
As the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports : Clearly , people who use marijuana overwhelmingly do not move on to other drug use .
That 's why the number of people who use marijuana will always be more than 10 times greater than the number of people who use cocaine , heroin , etc .
The fact that marijuana users rarely become involved in other drug use is right here in front of us .
Unfortunately , there is one important way in which marijuana use can result in exposure to other more dangerous drugs .
Laws against marijuana have created an unregulated black market , in which criminals control the supply and may attempt to market more dangerous drugs to people who just want marijuana .
As the Journal of the American Medical Association reported in 2003 Ironically , the only real gateway that exists is created by marijuana prohibition , yet proponents of harsh marijuana laws cynically cite the damage they 've caused as evidence that the drug itself is acutely harmful .
It 's truly the height of absurdity , yet it persists despite the mountain of categorical data I 've outlined above .
The point here is n’t just that marijuana is n’t actually a " gateway drug , " but that there really is no such thing as a gateway drug to begin with .
The term was invented by hysterical anti-drug zealots for the specific purpose of linking marijuana with harmful outcomes that could n’t otherwise be established .
Everyone knows marijuana is completely non-lethal , but if it leads to sticking needles in your arm , anything 's possible .
Through repeated use , the term began to stick and we 're now confronted with a marijuana legalization debate in which 46 % of the country believes an antiquated , widely - refuted fabrication that erroneously renders marijuana as deadly and unpredictable as anything a scared parent can imagine .
It 's perfectly typical of the unhinged drug war demagogues that one of their most popular anti-pot propaganda points does n't even actually have anything to do with pot .
Their tireless reliance on such nonsense may go a long way towards explaining why support for legalization is growing faster than ever before .

Yesterday , we saw a spate of rumors about Twitter being acquired following a report from Gawker that said Apple and Twitter were in “ serious negotiations ” about a deal in the $ 700 million range .
Today , making an appearance on The View , Twitter co-founder Biz Stone told Barbara Walters flat out that “ We are not for sale . ”
Frankly , we ’re not surprised .
On Tuesday , Technologizer offered a recap of a dozen other very sexy , high - profile Apple acquisition rumors that never happened .
Meanwhile , the history of big tech companies acquiring social sites is not one full of success stories either .
For example , Yahoo recently announced it was shutting down Geocities , one of the first major acquisitions in the social space .
But you do n’t have to go back that far for other big company–big social site deals gone wrong .
Google shutdown both Jaiku and Dodgeball after acquisition , while MySpace has languished and lost its lead in social networking since being purchased by News Corp .
Not to mention , the Twitter guys clearly have a ton of conviction in what they ’re doing .
In spite of the fact the company is yet to reveal a business model , they do not appear to be tempted by the half dozen or so companies with the bankroll to make their small team very rich , very quickly .
Further , their value is seemingly going up daily , as traffic has been growing at better than a 50 percent month - over - month clip lately .
My most recent Comment was a series of small jokes riffing on a big joke , namely a moronic suggestion by the governor of Texas that his state might secede from the Union on account of the tyranny of slightly higher marginal tax rates for the rich .
It was a thin reed to build a whole piece on , but it was all I had .
I should have looked harder .
I ’m usually a careful reader of Talking Points Memo , but I had somehow missed Brian Beutler ’s April 16th post , in which he brings the startling intelligence that the Georgia state senate , by a 43 - 1 vote , has passed a resolution that mixes three parts inanity and one part prospective treason into a Kompletely Krazy Kocktail of militia - minded moonshine and wacko white lightning — a resolution that not only endorses defiance of federal law but also threatens anarchy and revolution .
Really , you ca n’t make this stuff up .
You have to read it in full to believe it .
Even then you ca n’t believe it .
You thought that “ nullification ” had been rendered inoperative by the Civil War ?
Well , think again .
You considered secession a pre-Appomattox kind of thing ?
Well , reconsider .
You assumed that John C. Calhoun was a dead parrot ?
Well , turns out he was only resting .
The resolution is written in a mock eighteenth - century style , ornate and pompous .
Just two of its twenty sentences account for more than 1,200 of its 2,200 words .
But the substance is even nuttier than the style .
It begins by saying that what it sneeringly calls “ a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States ” limits the “ General Government ” only to specifically named powers , such as punishing piracy and counterfeiting , and that “ each party ” to the “ compact , ” i.e. , each state , is the final judge of whether the “ General Government ” has overstepped its very tight bounds .
Among other rights , the states “ retain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom . ”
( There ’s a lovely phrase : “ the licentiousness of speech and of the press . ” )
If I ’m reading the resolution ’s convoluted language correctly , it also asserts that the states have a right to suppress “ libels , falsehood , and defamation , equally with heresy and false religion ” without interference from “ federal tribunals . ”
There ’s more .
If a state does n’t like some federal law , then “ nullification of the act is the rightful remedy . ”
And if a state decides that “ any Act by the Congress of the United States , Executive Order of the President of the United States of America or Judicial Order by the Judicatories of the United States of America ” exceeds what the state considers the proper bounds of federal authority , then said act or executive order or court order “ shall constitute a nullification of the Constitution for the United States of America by the government of the United States of America . ”
What kind of act ?
“ Further infringements on the right to keep and bear arms including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition , ” for example .
The kicker :
That should any such act of Congress become law or Executive Order or Judicial Order be put into force , all powers previously delegated to the United States of America by the Constitution for the United States shall revert to the several States individually .
Any future government of the United States of America shall require ratification of three quarters of the States seeking to form a government of the United States of America and shall not be binding upon any State not seeking to form such a government .
Italics mine .
If Congress were to reinstate the assault rifle ban ( admittedly an unlikely prospect ) , there would be no more United States of America .
To repeat : this was passed by the stalwart patriots of the Georgia state senate by a vote of forty - three to one .
According to Beutler , the South Dakota house passed a similar resolution , 51 - 18 , and an Oklahoma version passed that state ’s house , 83 - 13 , and its state senate , 25 - 17 .
Oklahoma ’s Democratic governor , Brad Henry , vetoed it , noting dryly in his veto message that it “ does not serve the state or its citizens in any positive manner . ”
I do n’t have the dates of the South Dakota and Oklahoma resolutions , but the Georgia one passed on April 1st .
So I suppose it ’s possible that the whole thing is an April Fool ’s joke .
Ed Kilgore has more to say on all this at the Democratic Strategist .
By Ben Cohen
The Huffington Post is reporting on the latest Republican Health Care proposal .
I have n't gone over it in detail , but it looks an absolute joke from the outset .
The basic premise is to give people ' guaranteed choice ' ( whatever that means ) , and make private insurance companies compete with each other .
The whole thing will be paid for with - you guessed it - tax cuts , and it will be regulated by a non profit entity will punish companies that ' cherry pick ' health patients .
The Republicans are extremely fearful of a public health program , because all the insurance companies that fund their party wo n't be able to compete .
They are disguising this by saying the government wants to take over health care and stop consumer choice , but in reality , it 's an explicit admission that the private insurance industry is a complete failure .

You can tear the logic apart quite easily : Republicans believe in free markets .
The Government wants to implement its own program to compete in the market .
If the free market really works , then the best plan will win .
If a private plan is better it will win .
If a public plan ( that is not enforced ) is better , then by their own logic , that will win too .
So , let 's see which plan consumers like best , and may the best plan win .

Editor 's Note 6/25/2009 : Farrah Fawcett passed away today .
This story was co-published with The Los Angeles Times and appeared in that newspaper on May 11 , 2009 .
For more than 2 1/ 2 years , Farrah Fawcett 's battle with cancer has sparked a flurry of headlines for celebrity tabloids .
But it also has stripped the actress of her ability to seek treatment while maintaining her privacy , she said in an interview .
In a three - hour conversation with The Times last August -- her only media interview after being diagnosed with anal cancer in September 2006 -- Fawcett denounced the National Enquirer for publishing leaked details about her illness , including some that she said were false .
And she criticized UCLA Medical Center for failing to protect her medical records from snooping employees .
The former " Charlie 's Angels " star , 62 , said she set up a real - life sting operation to prove to UCLA that one of its employees was leaking her medical data to the Enquirer .
She also talked about the pressure she felt from the hospital to donate money to set up a foundation in her name .
Above all , in a firm voice that betrayed no hint of her terminal illness , Fawcett described how she was deprived of the choice that most other cancer patients have : when , and even whether , to share information with family , friends or strangers .
" It 's much easier to go through something and deal with it without being under a microscope , " she said .
" It was stressful .
I was terrified of getting the chemo .
It 's not pleasant .
And the radiation is not pleasant . "
" It becomes your life , " she said , sitting on the couch of her Los Angeles home , flanked by an Andy Warhol portrait of her and surrounded by sculptures she crafted .
" People call , ' How are you ? '
' How do you feel ? '
' We 're praying for you . '
' Do you still have your hair ? '
' What do you feel like ? '
When every single call is that kind of call ... it 's all you talk about .
It 's all - consuming .
Then , your quality of life is never the same . "
Despite federal patient privacy laws , no details about a celebrity 's medical condition appear to be off - limits .
Celebrity
Web sites draw millions of visitors each day , and the appetite for news about ailing stars is insatiable .
" Particularly when it 's something sexy or scandalous , or on the negative side , something kind of tragic and sad , for whatever reason , the public is interested in those types of stories , " said Brandy Navarre , vice president of X17 Inc. , a paparazzi agency .
As for Fawcett , Navarre said , " I think it 's really just an American icon and the public 's love of this woman and the nostalgia and everything around her . "
The tabloids , long fascinated by Fawcett , became even more enthralled after her cancer diagnosis .
More than once , the Enquirer said that Fawcett was near death or had given up , including a December 2006 article headlined , " Farrah Begs : ' Let Me Die . ' "
That prompted a flurry of letters from other cancer patients asking her not to give up hope because she was a role model for them .
" God , I would never say something like that , " she said .
" To think that people who did look up to me and felt positive because I was going through it too and yet I was strong ... it just negated all that . "
As time went on and more stories appeared , Fawcett said she grew convinced that information about her medical condition was being leaked by someone at UCLA .
Whenever she sought treatment there , word always got out .
Even when the tabloid reports were false , she said , they were based on a morsel of truth .
When she went in for an eye exam , for instance , " they had to say I was going blind . "
When she had a pap smear , " they had to say that the cancer had spread ; I was having a hysterectomy . "
" I actually kept saying for months and months and months , ' This is coming from here , [ UCLA ] , " Fawcett said .
" I was never more sure of anything in my life . "
Fawcett said she realized that she needed to prove her theory .
So , when she found out that her cancer had returned in May 2007 , she deliberately withheld the news from nearly all of her relatives and friends .
" I set it up with the doctor , " she said .
" I said , ' OK , you know and I know . ' ... I knew that if it came out , it was coming from UCLA . "
Within days of her diagnosis , the news was in the Enquirer .
" I could n't believe how fast it came out , " Fawcett said .
" Maybe four days . "
UCLA began an investigation and quickly found that one employee had accessed her records more often than her own doctors .
Fawcett said she asked for the employee 's name , but the senior UCLA official in charge of patient privacy refused , saying , " We have a responsibility to protect our employees . "
" And I said , ' More than your patients ? ' ... "
Fawcett recalled .
At the same time , Fawcett said , UCLA repeatedly asked her to donate money to the hospital for a foundation to be set up in her name .
The university went so far as to give her a prewritten letter that she could sign and fill in a dollar amount for the foundation , documents show .
It also created an official - looking proposed announcement that said , " Ms. Farrah Fawcett has established a fund in the Division of Digestive Diseases with the expansive goal of facilitating prevention and diagnosis in gastrointestinal cancers . "
" They 're acting like nothing happened , " Fawcett said with a laugh .
" It 's like , ' This will make it all OK . '
I felt that all of a sudden , they were trying awfully hard to push it .
Too pushy .
In other words , it made me suspicious . "
In a statement issued last week in response to Fawcett 's comments , UCLA Health System said it " values its relationship with its donors and potential donors " and keeps its discussions with them private .
The statement also said UCLA had strengthened its policies and systems to better protect patient privacy .
For example , it now masks patients '
Social Security numbers in electronic files and forces users to identify their reasons for looking at clinical records .
It also implemented new patient privacy training for all staff , among other things .
" UCLA Health System considers patient confidentiality a critical part of our mission of teaching , research and patient care , " it said .
After months of requests , UCLA ultimately provided Fawcett 's lawyers with the name of the administrative specialist who had gone through her records .
In July 2007 , as the hospital moved to fire the worker , Lawanda Jackson , she quit .
Federal prosecutors tracked the leaks to Jackson as well .
Jackson pleaded guilty in December to a felony charge of violating federal medical privacy laws for commercial purposes , but died in March of cancer before she could be sentenced .
Prosecutors alleged that beginning in 2006 , the Enquirer gave her checks totaling at least $ 4,600 in her husband 's name .
Fawcett said she decided to speak up about the ordeal because she wants to see the Enquirer charged criminally for inducing UCLA workers to invade her records .
" They obviously know it 's like buying stolen goods , " she said .
" They 've committed a crime .
They 've paid her money . "
The U.S. Attorney 's Office said its investigation was ongoing .
Cameron Stracher , senior media counsel for American Media , Inc. , the Enquirer 's parent company , declined to discuss the investigation , but issued the following statement : " The National Enquirer respects Ms. Fawcett and her brave battle with cancer , and acknowledges , as she has , that her public discussion of her illness has provided a valuable and important forum for awareness about the disease . ”
In part as a result of Fawcett 's experience , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law tougher penalties for institutions and individuals that violate patients ' privacy .
California health inspectors concluded that , all told , Jackson looked at the records of 939 patients " without any legitimate reason " from April 2003 to May 2007 .
Fawcett said she was not surprised that none have come forward to discuss it .
Some do n't want to draw renewed attention to the procedures they had performed .
Complaining , Fawcett said , would have been fodder for the tabloids .
Even as her illness progressed , Fawcett was followed by paparazzi , including when she traveled to Germany for treatments .
When she returned to LAX in March , after her most recent trip to Germany , photographers snapped pictures as she was taken to her car in a wheelchair .
" I'm a private person , " she said in the interview .
" I 'm shy about people knowing things .
And I 'm really shy about my medical [ care ] .
It would be good if I could just go and heal and then when I decided to go out , it would be OK . "
" It seems that there are areas that should be off - limits . "
The interview was conducted in August on condition that The Times delay publication until it received permission from Fawcett or Craig Nevius , an executive producer of the upcoming documentary , " Farrah 's Story , " which chronicles Fawcett 's struggle to recover and maintain her privacy .
" There will be a good time , and what I have to say then will be more important , " she said at the time .
On April 29 , Nevius gave written permission for the interview to be published within five days of the documentary 's broadcast date .
The documentary is scheduled for broadcast on NBC on Friday .
The Times ' interview with Fawcett was videotaped for possible inclusion in the documentary .
Fawcett 's condition has deteriorated since the time of the interview -- the cancer has spread to her liver -- and she is now bedridden and has lost her hair , her longtime companion Ryan O’Neal told People magazine on May 4 .
Her treatment has essentially stopped , he said .
During the interview , Fawcett was focused and thoughtful , openly pondering the impact she wanted to have in several areas , including patient privacy and alternative treatments for cancer .
" I 'm holding onto the hope that there is some reason that I got cancer and there is something -- that may not be very clear to me right now -- but that I will do , " she said .
Ornstein reported much of this story while on staff at The Los Angeles Times .
He is now a senior reporter at ProPublica , a nonprofit investigative reporting newsroom in New York .
Logical State Threads for Prolog
Andreas Kågedal
Peter Van Roy
Bruno Dumant
What is it ?
Instead of adding all those threaded state variables the Logical State Threads package provides you with a way to just declare what predicates should use what state thread and then the package adds these threaded variables for you .
Main features :
Higher abstraction level than EDCGs .
The programmer will not need to be as aware of the underlying transformation since it is never necessary to access the threaded arguments directly .
Threads may be arbitrarily combined and accessed across nested scopes .
Flexible accessing / modification of the thread state .
Multiple ' methods ' can be defined for the same thread , which allows the thread to be modified in different ways .
Much improved consistency checking at loading time with many new warning / error messages .
Better integration with the SICStus Prolog module system .
Threads with the same name defined in separate modules are kept separate .
Design based on formal semantics , rewriting accumulator clause syntax to a core language and defining a transformation from the core language to standard Horn clauses .

Compressed with gzip : threads - 0.1.tar.gz
Not compressed : threads - 0.1.tar Using HTTP instead of FTP : threads - 0.1.tar.gz
Where did it come from ?
The current system is mainly written by Andreas Kågedal and is based on the Aquarius Prolog EDCG preprocessor .
Most of the new functionality ( taken from the Wild_Life version and new ideas ) has been added under constant discussions with both Peter Van Roy and Bruno Dumant .
Bruno Dumant has also developed a formal semantics for Logical State Threads ( not yet published ) .
It is renamed Logical State Threads since it is not really a grammar formalism .

Everyone wants to be more productive , make fewer mistakes and write good code .
Of course , that all depends on you , but in most cases integrated development environments ( IDEs ) can help you achieve those goals more easily .
Unfortunately , choosing the right IDE is very difficult because a lot needs to be considered .
And the website of almost every IDE tells us it is the best one
Everyone wants to be more productive , make fewer mistakes and write good code .
Of course , that all depends on you , but in most cases integrated development environments ( IDEs ) can help you achieve those goals more easily .
Unfortunately , choosing the right IDE is very difficult because a lot needs to be considered .
And the website of almost every IDE tells us it is the best one .
You may also want to check out the following Smashing Magazine articles :
In this post , we ’ll take a close look at the most popular PHP IDEs , exploring their functions , comparing them in a table and drawing some conclusions .
Hopefully , you ’ll get an idea of what each PHP IDE has to offer and which one best fits your needs .
For a long time , I worked in PHP only for fun .
I ’ve developed Java Web applications with Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA .
These are a great Java IDEs .
Not surprisingly , I wanted something similar for PHP .
The following are some of the features that I found needed to be considered .
IDE Features
1. Syntax highlighting
Good syntax highlighting improves code readability a lot .
Really !
Just look at this :
2. Code completion
Automatic code suggestions can help the developer avoid having to type so much .
If it supports custom classes and phpDoc , it can even save you from having to read project documentation .
Good code completion can also prevent typos .
For example , if typing $ cotroller - > does not show you any suggestions , you ’ll know something is wrong .
Uh oh… it should be $ controller !
Poor code completion can slow you down if too many variants are shown or your class methods are not picked up .
It is also good to have file name completion in HTML src= ” and PHP include and require .
3. Navigation
One of the most boring things is trying to find where a certain variable has been defined or used .
Some good IDEs can help with “ GoTo ” actions , like go to definition .
Another important feature is search .
Searching should not take a long time , even with large projects .
Even better is if the IDE lets you move quickly to the next occurrence of a search phrase , like Firefox does with its Quick Find feature .
4. Errors and warnings highlighting
On - the - fly syntax checking can prevent various typos and common programming mistakes .
In the example below , the IDE indicates that you may have used = instead of == :
The more the IDE detects , the better – except false positives , of course .
5. Refactoring and code generation
Refactoring is basically a set of techniques for turning weak code into solid code .
Its implementation in PHP IDEs is very weak compared to that of compiled - language IDEs , such as Java and C , but it ’s still very useful .
Very basic PHP refactoring includes :
“ Move , ” which updates all includes and requires when moving a file to another directory .
“ Rename , ” which renames something and ensures it is renamed throughout the project .
“ Safe delete , ” which ensures deletion of a file does not harm other parts of the project .
In addition to basic refactoring , some IDEs can generate code for class constructors , getters / setters and even stub methods for a parent class .
6. Debugging
Debugging is not so critical in PHP because you can add echo s or use something like FirePHP without even having to recompile your code .
But for complex applications in which you need to add echo after each line to see what ’s going on , debugging can save you hours .
If the IDE is good enough , it provides you with step - by - step debugging and lets you see the current values of variables in scope .
7. Versioning system
Versioning is extremely useful for both team and one - person development .
It shows what changes have been made to a file , when they were made and by whom .
A good IDE allows you to visually compare revisions , copy changes from one version to another , revert to previous states and merge changes made by different team members .
When performing common checks and commits , integrating a versioning system such as CVS , SVN , git or Mercurial in your IDE is usually much better than running a separate application .
8. Client - side features
Using PHP alone is very rare .
CSS and JavaScript are almost always somewhere in your application .
So , good code completion , highlighting , navigation and perhaps some refactoring would be just as beneficial for the other languages and technologies you use in conjunction with PHP .
How To Choose A Good One ?
Every IDE provides a lot of features .
Some of those features are very useful , some are not .
Here are some guidelines to follow to narrow down the one for you :
Try free ones first .
Their feature set may be enough for you , and you would n’t need to pay for a license .
First , make sure the features you want are ones you really need .
If they are , check that they work properly in your IDE of choice .
If you find one IDE that fits well but is missing one or two features , try specialized tools .
Once you choose an IDE , play with it for a week before implementing it in a big project .
You may find your current working habits are too strong to allow you to feel comfortable with it .
A Comparison Table
Along with Vladimir Statsenko , who helped with the section on Aptana , I ’ve prepared this comparison table .
What Was Covered
Eclipse - based IDEs PDT , Zend Studio 6 , Aptana PHP and Aptana Studio Pro are built on the Eclipse platform .
That means you can use any of the thousands of Eclipse plug -ins out there .
If a feature you need is not integrated in the IDE itself , it is most likely available as a third party plug -in .
Eclipse PHP IDEs were the first freeware IDEs with true IDE capabilities , such as complex code completion , code navigation , projects support , etc .
Most of them are still free and very powerful .
NetBeans NetBeans is the new bright kid on the block , but not built on the Eclipse platform .
It has most of the features of other IDEs and yet more still .
And it ’s free , too .
Development of this IDE is very public , open and rapid .
Following the development blog and testing new builds as they come out is very interesting , even if there is already a stable version available ( v6.5 ) .
What Was Not Covered
There are plenty of powerful notepads such as PSPad , Notepad ++ , TextMate , vim and Emacs .
Some are very similar to IDEs and even better if you want a good text editor but not the full IDE experience .
Reviewing all of the good IDEs out there would not be possible ( there are so many ) , so only the major players are compared here .
PHP IDEs We Tested
Here is the list of PHP IDEs we included in our review :
PDT 1
PDT 2.0
Zend Studio 6
NetBeans 6.5
NetBeans 7 ( development version )
Aptana PHP
Aptana Studio Pro
Codelobster *
Nusphere PhpED 5.6 *
We thought it would be interesting to allow our readers to edit the table , which is hosted on Google Docs .
Feel free to add your favorite IDE if it ’s not there , or note some features on the ones that are .
The full table at Google Docs ( not editable snapshot )
* Codelobster and Nusphere PhpED were filled in by Russian community members .
Conclusion
Still not using IDE ?
You may be wasting time .
Try it .
You ’ll see the difference .
Both PDT and NetBeans are good .
If you need a lot of plug-ins , Eclipse is the better choice .
If editing tools and code completion are more important to you , then pick NetBeans .
NetBeans is a bit more responsive , too .
If you are mostly editing HTML and CSS , try Notepad ++ , vim , TextMate or Emacs .
They all have very good HTML editing capabilities and can be configured for simple code completion .
And they are faster and lighter than fully featured IDEs .
If you are editing complex JavaScript , try Aptana , which is amazing for JavaScript , or the Spket plug - in for Eclipse , which has nearly the same features .
And remember , IDEs are not meant to change the way you think .
They simply speed up the development process .
Commercial vs. Freeware
Strange as it may sound , commercial PHP IDEs such as Zend Studio and Aptana Studio Pro do not have significantly more advantages than free alternatives such as PDT2.0 and NetBeans , both of which are very good .
With Aptana Studio Pro , you get a good IE JavaScript debugger , SFTP , FTPS and some other less - than - useful features for $ 99 .
Like NetBeans , Zend Studio offers a bit more code completion and error detection than PDT .
It also has a very good customizable code formatter , refactoring capabilities ( which NetBeans also has ) and some wizards for the Zend Framework .
It starts at $ 399 .

150 peaceful protesters gathered in Amsterdam Saturday as part of a global action for the legalization of marijuana .
They congregated on a public square , paying attention to pro-legalization speeches as marijuana was smoked and music blasted from speakers around the crowd .
T - shirts with pro-cannabis messages , as well as snacks made with marijuana were sold at stands in the square .
“ Prohibiting something that people will always want causes illegality and the emergence of criminal gangs , ” Daan Rosenberg Polak , a publisher of pro-legalization literature , said to AFP at the meeting .
“ In the Netherlands , we ’ve had a good system since the 1970s , but recent governments have been trying to take us back to a more conservative system , ” he said , insisting that the reasonable use of marijuana had zero danger .
Saturday ’s protesters condemned Dutch law as deceitful for permitting the use of five grams of cannabis , but outlawing its growth and mass retail .
700 Dutch coffee shops have distinctive licenses to vend marijuana but cannot have more than 500 grams at their business .
A few Dutch municipalities have of late made known plans to shut down all or part of the coffee shops , mainly to dissuade crime and drug tourism .
Rowena Huijbregts of the Association for Cannabis Consumers insists that full legalization is the single decision , “ otherwise , people are forced to buy their soft drugs from dealers who also sell hard drugs . ”
On Friday , it was announced at the protest that there were protesters in 250 cities in the world , like Paris , Berlin and Madrid , in connection to the 10th annual Global Marijuana March .
The goal was to set in motion the full legalization of cannabis , from growth to the final sale .
“ Prohibiting cannabis has undesirable effects : it promotes trafficking , criminality , a black market economy and a poor quality product , ” contended Jacqueline Woerlee , a spokeswoman for the Association for the Abolition of Cannabis Prohibition .

Two - hundred and forty - three avocados , 32 entries and countless stomachaches later , Guac Bowl 2009 has crowned its king .
After years of spectacularly failed attempts , Guac Bowl co-founder and host Adam Pava finally walked away with the Best Presentation trophy for " Ms. Guac Man , " an arcade - table - sized replica of Ms. Pac Man complete with chips shaped like ghosts , custom - made graphics and an annoying audio stinger repeating , " Guaca , guaca , guaca . "
He bested favorite Rob Saccenti , a 28 - year - old art director who won last year 's presentation award with a carefully detailed Guac Alien .
Saccenti once again wowed spectators with " He 's No Guac to Me Dead , " a life - size replica of Han Solo encased in carbonite and guacamole , but the only trophy his Guac Solo came close to winning was the Icarus Award .
A shadow clouded the victory as participants lobbed accusation of vote - rigging at Pava , who also counted the votes .
" I 'm not above rigging the votes , " Pava admitted , " but no , I did not rig it ! "
Pava remained jubilant , the comeback kid of the Guac Bowl after last year 's disastrous " Guacweiler Beach " entry , a 4 - foot - by - 4 - foot box of guacamole beach that had to be staged outside .
Unfortunately , it was a rainy day , and a neighborhood cat walked through the piece .
" It 's like a monkey off my back .
It feels like I 'm seeing the sun for the first time , " he said .
" Guac , Paper , Scissors " won the sparsely entered Best Traditional Guacamole category , while " Deep - Fried Guac " won the Best Alternative Guacamole category .
This year 's least coveted trophy , the Icarus Award , " for the guac that soars closest to the sun , only to fall the farthest , " went to Michael Zimmer for his " Gueer , " a.k.a. guacamole beer .
" It 's like you 've been hazed when you try my Gueer , " he said .
Zimmer was hoping to bring together the two most wonderful things about the Super Bowl before they enter the digestive tract , but said , " It came out horribly .
It 's like somebody threw up in the bottle .
But it was the best I could have done with the concept , and I 'm proud . "
Updated , 5:08 p.m .
The original version of this story stated that Rob Saccenti only came close to winning the Icarus Award .
In fact , his entry " He 's No Guac To Me Dead " was a runner - up for both the Icarus Award and Best Presentation .
Updated , 12:35 p.m. , Thurs .
The earlier version of the story failed to mention some of the winning creators at Guac Bowl 2009 .
Christine Landry ’s " Guac , Paper , Scissors ” won Best Traditional Guac , while Craig Anderson ’s " Fried Guac " won Best Alternative Guac .

This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles by CNN about economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Sean , Brooke and Courtney with their parents , Donna and Robert LeBlanc , in a 2008 Christmas photo .
( CNN ) --
Over the last 2 ½ months , CNN profiled dozens of individuals and families struggling to weather these tough economic times .
Americans across the country face unmanageable debt , foreclosures and unemployment .
According to the U.S. Department of Labor , unemployment climbed to 8.9 percent in February 2009 , up 5.2 percent from a year earlier , affecting people of all ages , educational backgrounds , and in all parts of the country .
Some economists say the U.S. economy wo n't recover until 2010 or beyond .
Here , we check in with some of the families who first shared their struggles with CNN 's iReport.com .
Tell us how you 're surviving in this economy
Rob LeBlanc : Becoming a pizza deliveryman to make ends meet
Thirty - five - year - old Rob LeBlanc of Lafayette , Louisiana , was willing to do whatever it took to feed his family of six last year .
He became a pizza deliveryman for more than five months after losing his job as a manager at a truck stop restaurant making $ 55,000 a year .
He and his wife Donna LeBlanc , 35 , faced rising medical debt from Donna LeBlanc 's unexpected case of pneumonia and tonsillitis in 2007 .
While Rob LeBlanc says he was depressed after multiple job rejections , he said he is glad he took the job for the family delivering pizza for $ 10 dollars an hour .
In January , Rob LeBlanc told CNN he got a job at a private security company .
He still holds that job today .
iReport.com :
We made lemonade
He is working odd hours , sometimes at the crack of dawn and sometimes into the late hours of the night .
He does n't get to see his kids as much , but he is earning a little over $ 36,000 , a much better deal than working as a pizza deliveryman .
At the same time , his wife continues working her job at a mosquito control company .
Donna LeBlanc once dreamed of going to college to study biology .
With the family 's finances looking up , she said she is looking into applying for government grants so she can go to school to get her degree online .
Their son Sean , 16 , struggled to find a position at a grocery store .
Now he mows lawns for the neighbors to make money , according to the LeBlancs .
But the last few months have been full of unexpected obstacles .
Donna LeBlanc 's father was unexpectedly diagnosed with lung cancer and passed away in March .
Her sister 's husband filed for divorce after 19 years of marriage and Donna LeBlanc took her sister in .
Without Rob LeBlanc 's stable job and steady stream of income at the security company , Donna Blanc said her family " would n't have been able to survive "
" His job has made it a whole lot easier for us , " Donna LeBlanc said .
Rob LeBlanc said his hours will soon become more regular , hopefully allowing him to spend more time with his family .
He hopes to move into a supervisor position in the future .
" We will weather these situations the way we always do , " says Donna LeBlanc .
" What can you do when you get hit by wind ?
You can either stand up or bend back and fold . "
Leah Bird and Ed Wright : From Beverly
Hills to camping on mom and dad 's farm
This January , Ed Wright and his wife Leah Bird swapped their happy Beverly Hills apartment lifestyle for a trailer on a five - acre farm in Oregon owned by Wright 's parents .
It was n't an easy decision to make , but became necessary when Wright , 48 , was laid off from his job managing life insurance portfolios for millionaires , the couple says .
Life has been a drastic change for the couple .
In Los Angeles , California , they dined with friends at the trendiest restaurants and spent countless hours at the beach surfing and frolicking in the sun .
At the farm , they learned to tend to animals and shovel manure .
They also learned to get along with Wright 's parents .
iReport.com : From Beverly Hills to Hillbillies
The couple recently celebrated three months living in their 1974 Airstream trailer , shaped like a silver bullet and purchased from Craigslist .
They worked hard remodeling the trailer , first a new kitchen and then a new bathroom .
They finally finished the construction and are adding final touches , putting up photographs to make it truly feel like home .
" Our trailer has definitely become more livable , " Wright said .
Things are looking up for the couple .
Bird , 28 , was ecstatic to find a job as an office assistant in town .
While she is taking a $ 15,000 job cut , the couple says it 's better than nothing in this bleak job market .
Wright is still unemployed but he 's taking his time off to figure out his next career move .
For now , he has taken an interest in local produce and plans to grow his own fruits and vegetables .
Each day he works on preparing the compost so that it will be ready in May .
He has already planted three apple trees and grape vines .
" We really have a sense of peace here and we are feeling better now , " he said .
" Things could be a lot worse . "
And would the couple ever move back to Los Angeles ?
" Not unless they offered me a great paying job , " Wright said .
" But even then , I would work a few years , quit and then come back here . "
Jeffrey Root : Moving to your parents ' basement at 27
Saddled with credit card debt and working at a low - paying fast - food restaurant , Jeffrey Root , 27 , decided to go back to college to study English during the economic crisis to better his future .
To save money , Jeffrey Root and his wife Mandi Root , 22 , accepted an offer from his parents and moved into their basement in Springville , Utah , last year .
The couple knew a rent - free place would make it easier for Jeffrey Root to return to school and pay off credit card debt .
Moving back in seems to be a growing trend across the country .
Multigenerational houses increased from 5 million in 2000 to 6.2 million in 2008 , according to AARP .
Some of the increase is due to " boomerang children " who move back in with their parents after leaving their home .
It 's been more than six months since the couple moved in and they say their relationship with Jeffrey Root 's parents is good .
Jeffrey Root is in his second semester at Utah Valley University taking general courses before delving into his major next year .
His favorite class is archaeology .
iReport.com : Live with parents
" I consider myself a jack of all trades , " said Jeffrey Root , who plans on graduating in spring 2011 and then going on to get his masters and doctorate so he can eventually teach .
" I really love learning . "
Meanwhile , his wife continues working at a retail clothing store to bring in extra cash .
He also works part time at the university .
The couple is excited that they lowered their credit debt from $ 8,000 to just $ 1,500 .
They hope to get their own place by then end of the summer or early next year .

Nicole Thompson - Arce : Living with an ex-husband and current husband
Nicole Thompson - Arce , a 28 - year - old mother of two , was stuck .
When her husband Matthew Arce lost his job , the couple began to accumulate serious debt .
The sour economy made job prospects grim .
So the couple did the unthinkable :
They moved in with her ex-husband .
Despite a messy divorce and custody battle with Nicole Thompson - Arce in 2005 , Craig Thompson , 42 , invited the family into his home in Omaha , Nebraska , when he heard about her dire financial situation last Christmas .
Craig Thompson 's finances were better as he still held on to his job of 18 years at a Wal - Mart bakery .
Nicole Thompson - Arce said yes right away .
iReport : Read Thompson - Arce 's post
And her husband , Matthew Arce does n't mind at all .
In fact , Mathew Arce , 22 , and Craig Thompson are friends .
There have been many benefits for the couple aside from saving money .
The two girls get to see their father more often , every day for dinner instead of once or twice a week , Nicole Thompson - Arce says .
" The girls get to see us all the time , " she said .
" It 's brought us all closer together and the girls are seeing that something positive can come out of divorce . "
She said there have n't been any fights since they moved in to the three - bedroom , one - bathroom house .
Nicole Thompson - Arce and her husband share one room while her daughters , Victoria , 7 , and Caitlyn , 6 , share another room .
Her ex-husband has the third room .
The family likes the living arrangement so much that Nicole Thompson - Arce and her husband plan on staying until the girls finish high school .
Even if finances improve , they say they will continue living together
" We believe that if it is n't broken , then why change it , " he said .
Jean Lindsay : Building an online posse at 67 to find a job
Jean Lindsay knew recovering from a job loss would be challenging -- especially at the age of 67 .
About 1.07 million Americans 55 and older also lost their jobs , according to the AARP .
Lindsay found little success searching for a new job and was even rejected from a position at Lowe 's garden center .
While Lindsay , who has two master 's degrees , panicked at first , she eventually found a way to make her Internet - savvy skills work for her .
With a Web camera she received from her brother , she posted videotaped monologues about her struggles to find a job .
She made motivational videos telling older folks to " Get up and get out ! "
She has posted more than 40 videos on CNN's iReport .
She said the support she gets from her fans helped her get through .
Her relentless paid off .
Last Friday , she was offered a telemarketing job for a company in New York that helps parents secure better tuition deals with universities .
" I feel so lucky to get this job , " she says .
Watch Lindsay 's post
Lindsay says she was impressed with the company because there are several other older workers there .
She said she enjoyed meeting all of the people .
" I felt so comfortable there , " she said .
She said her computer skills are a tremendous asset for the job since much of the work will be done at home .
Her boss was particularly impressed with her iReporting skills , she said .
" It 's getting tougher to stand on your feet all day and be a sales clerk , " said Lindsay , who is glad to be working from home .

ANN ARBOR —
For bacteria in wastewater treatment plants , the stars align perfectly to create a hedonistic mating ground for antibiotic - resistant superbugs eventually discharged into streams and lakes .
In the first known study of its kind , Chuanwu Xi of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and his team sampled water containing the bacteria Acinetobacter at five sites in and near Ann Arbor ’s wastewater treatment plant .
They found the so - called superbugs ?
bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics ? up to 100 yards downstream from the discharge point into the Huron River .
Xi stresses that while the finding may be disturbing , it is important to understand that much work is still needed to assess what risk , if any , the presence of superbugs in aquatic environments poses to humans .
“ We still need to understand the link between aquatic and human multiple drug resistant bacteria , ” said Xi , assistant professor of public health .
Xi and colleagues found that while the total number of bacteria left in the final discharge effluent declined dramatically after treatment , the remaining bacteria was significantly more likely to resist multiple antibiotics than bacteria in water samples upstream .
Some strains resisted as many as seven of eight antibiotics tested .
The bacteria in samples taken 100 yards downstream also were more likely to resist multiple drugs than bacteria upstream .
“ Twenty or 30 years ago , antibiotics would have killed most of these strains , no problem , ” he said .
Multiple antibiotic - resistant bacteria has emerged as one of the top public health issues worldwide in the last few decades as the overuse of antibiotics and other factors have caused bacteria to become resistant to common drugs .
Xi ’s group chose to study Acinetobacter because it is a growing cause of hospital - acquired infections and because of its ability to acquire antibiotic resistance .
Xi said the problem is n’t that treatment plants do n’t do a good job of cleaning the water ?
it ’s that they simply are n’t equipped to remove all antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals entering the treatment plants .
The treatment process is fertile ground for the creation of superbugs because it encourages bacteria to grow and break down the organic matter .
However , the good bacteria grow and replicate along with the bad .
In the confined space , bacteria share resistant genetic materials , and remaining antibiotics and other stressors may select multi-drug resistant bacteria .
While scientists learn more about so - called superbugs , patients can do their part by not insisting on antibiotics for ailments that antibiotics do n’t treat , such as a common cold or the flu , Xi said .
Also , instead of flushing unused drugs , they should be saved and disposed of at designated collection sites so they do n’t enter the sewer system .
The next step , said Xi , is to see how far downstream the superbugs survive and try to understand the link between aquatic and human superbugs .
This study did not look past 100 yards .
Xi ’s colleagues include visiting scholar Yongli Zhang ; Carl Marrs , associate professor of public health ; and Carl Simon , professor of mathematics .

JSF sucks
May 15 , 2009
This post is intended to be a reference for those evaluating or contemplating using JSF .
Once in a while , I find myself having to convince people that there are far , far , better alternatives to JSF .
With this blog post finally in place , from now on I will probably just refer people here .
Please pass this link on to those you feel will benefit from this fairly large selection of links and real - life experiences collected from across the interwebs .

My 2c :
Clearly , many architects recommend JSF as a “ safe choice ” for new projects just because it is a “ standard ” .
All I ’ll say is that there is more than enough evidence to prove that JSF is flawed in some significant and fundamental ways – especially compared to available alternatives .
We all know what happened to EJB 1.X / 2.X. Will JSF go the same way ?

You ca n’t help thinking – if JSF is so great as the vendors / authors / evangelists would have you believe – why are there so many competing Java web - frameworks ?
Quote :
For the majority of intents and purposes , GWT invalidates JSF .
Both frameworks seek to isolate web developers from HTTP , but due to the fact that Google built GWT from the ground up with AJAX in mind , GWT offers a cleaner abstraction , better type safety , and a lower learning curve .
When it comes to AJAX and JSF , you ’re at the mercy of which functionality your JSF components offer .

Quote :
The biggest reason is that creating custom components in JSF can be difficult , especially if you want your components to have lots of javascript / css that it contributes to the page .
JSF requires that you use a writer to send your component ’s HTML to the browser .
With this system you end up with spaghetti code that ’s hard to debug , and hard to test .
Add ajax functionality to the mix and you have a featureset that JSF just ca n’t handle in the current version .

It is no secret that JSF is made for tool vendors .
However , it is somewhat possible to get away with working with JSF by hand only ( in fact Ive done a fairly large project this way ) , though this is neither on par with using tools nor easy as many proponents claim .

Re : Rod Johnson : “ Java EE 6 Gets it Right ” – in response to a comment I made on a TSS thread , Rod Johnson says this :
I still have n’t made up my mind about JSF , but we have people in our community who want to use Spring ( and Spring Web Flow ) and JSF , and it ’s important that we accommodate that .
To put that quote in context , note that three years prior , Rod Johnson and Juergen Hoeller ( Spring Framework # 1 and # 2 ) had this to say about JSF on page 408 of the book “ Expert One - on - One J2EE Development without EJB ” [ 2004 , Wiley ] :
Java Server Faces has been hyped as the next big thing in J2EE web development for more than two years and is now taking shape .
In its current incarnation , JSF is a JSP centric affair that is heavily targeted toward GUI builder tools , resulting in code that gathers all sorts of concerns in the web page .
There is no notion of view - agnostic controller and model , and no concept of pluggable views .
With this programming model , JSF is well - suited for attracting .NET and other RAD developers , but not for becoming the de-facto standard web MVC framework in the Java world .
We expect to see a massive vendor marketing push behind JSF .
However , we are not convinced that JSF will represent a real advance on existing open source solutions such as Tapestry , WebWork , and Spring web MVC .

Developing long term strategies for using Java EE technology – a very telling quote from this IBM DeveloperWorks article goes like this :
JSF is still a relatively new technology .
JSF is undergoing a major revision for the next round of specifications with an expected integration between JSF managed beans and Enterprise JavaBeans™ .
The risk of changes affecting existing applications will be higher here than with other presentation technologies .
IBM does have representation on the JSF expert group and will keep a watchful eye out for problems .
One area of future concern is be how well Ajax support in JSF will follow the specifications for the OpenAjax Alliance .
Through its participation , IBM will try to ensure that compatibility is maintained as the standards move forward .
Ajax support in JSF will be new ( when it appears ) and use of that feature will be at a somewhat higher risk than other parts of JSF .
More details will be known in early 2009 .

Ever since I ’ve had the experience of using ASP .
Net and comparing it to JSF , I ’ve been hoping that someone would come up with a way to improve the sorry state of affairs that is JSF component creation .
Far too much time is spent on complex components and supporting a billion renderkits , when most of the time , I just want to be able to composite a couple of preexisting controls .

I actually forgot how much JSF sucked ( I remember it was hard to test ) .
The biggest problem is that it ’s been developed by someone who does n’t use it to write real applications .

A rant on Java standards – blog post by Jose Noheda .
Quote :
How can something like JSF be promoted to be the standard ?
A component framework that lacks even one interesting component !
That relies on third party libraries ( many OSS ) that are , of course , incompatible between them .
Each one with a different AJAX approach ( as the specification says nothing on the topic ) .
And , worst of all , incompatible with JSP / JSTL and portlet development .

[ 2009 -07 - 27 ] U , I and JSF – still painful after all these years – detailed article by Karl Banke .
His conclusion :
[..] it is not a proper component framework , let alone a complete one .
It is intrinsically over engineered , yet critically underspecified .
As such , it can serve as a powerful basis for a real component framework .
Because of the critical parts missing it is essentially impossible to mix JSF components from various providers without including a lot of overhead and loosing a lot of consistency .
Frameworks like JSF should essentially make easy things easy and hard things possible .
Yet JSF ’s standard components , even in JSF 2.0 , fail to deliver basic One - O - One web application features from 10 years ago .
It is a remarkably complex specification that delivers pretty much nothing out of the box .
[ 2009 - 11 - 10 ] JSF 2 – evaluation and test – very detailed evaluation of the brand new JSF 2.0 reference implementation ( Mojarra ) by Sebastian Hennebrueder and Holger Brade .
Sebastian ’s conclusion :
JSF looks like an old castle , where every generation added pieces , towers and buildings .
I do n’t blame the developers for this , as the code shows , that they know how to do a proper job .
I believe that the reason for the current status of JSF is that the features are defined by a specification .
The specification is industry driven with a focus on being backward compatible instead of being technology driven .
Everything works somehow but always rather complex than simple .
Every release makes it worse as nothing is dropped .
I am sorry , but I can only see a bad ending for such a strategy .
Pages are extremely verbose .
Using it make you feel being unproductive most of the time .
JSF 2 brings some innovation but in a lot of areas it does n’t even catch up with the current status of other frameworks .
It is likely to be outdated before it is actually stable .
I would n’t use it for new projects and especially not for large enterprise projects .

– some insights into why popular open - source ECM vendor Alfresco is dropping JSF in favor of a more Web 2.0 oriented approach :
Alfresco has been fairly open with the fact that their ‘ Explorer ’ client which is based on JSF technology is no longer being actively developed .
While JSF is still around and actively used at a lot of places , it is a ‘ heavier ’ technology compared to a lot of whiz - bang Web 2.0 stuff .

Note that as of September 2010 , only ONE production ready JSF 2.0 component library exists .
The JSF 2.0 spec was approved well over a year back ( May 2009 ) and was available in a draft form much earlier as is typical in the JCP .

Java EE , Spring , and why I care – a rant on Java EE vendor FUD by Papick G. Taboada :
Take a look at JSF .
JSF is obligatory part of a full stack application server , but JSF gives you nothing .
Again , you have a component model , and each vendor will provide the required runtime API .
But you wo n‘t be happy with that , you will need a JSF library like RichFaces , ICEFaces , PrimeFaces , MyFaces , etc .
Take a good look at those .
You will realize that , once you start using JSF , you are not standard anymore , you are bound to the JSF library vendor .
The programming models for the components are different , the tags have different name .
Switching or mixing JSF library ranges from very hard to impossible .
So what good is the JSF standard for ?
Why is RichFaces for JSF 2.0 taking so long and how many people are developing it ?
Will it be there tomorrow ?
Will it be continued ?
JSF surely , but RichFaces , ICEFaces ?
Who can assure that ?

According to Balunas , the expert group was still very active in their communication and development , and he does n’t believe that dissolution of the group was necessary .
He says that it will now be “ very difficult ” to continue supporting the Java Server Faces specification without an official JSF and EG in the JCP , mainly because there are no longer intellectual property and governance guarantees involved in JSF development if there is no current or successor JSR for JSF .

What ’s your answer to that ?
And if your answer is “ that ’s stupid – you know , there ’s a better way to do that ” , the press by and large can’t parse your sentences .

Spaniard takes stunning win from Rossi and Pedrosa .
Jorge Lorenzo emerged victorious from a thrilling Polini Grand Prix of Japan at Twin Ring Motegi , the second win of his MotoGP career and a result that retained his 100 % podium record in the 2009 season .
The Fiat Yamaha rider took little time in taking the reigns of the race , having started from the front row and showed no fear when faced with the likes of Dani Pedrosa and Valentino Rossi in front of him .
However , despite a relatively comfortable advantage , Lorenzo was never quite able to say a definitive ‘ sayonara ’ to his rivals as the action heated up .
He held on to cross the line with a gap of less than two seconds between him and second placed teammate Rossi .
Lorenzo moves up into first place in the overall classification , for the second time in his MotoGP career .
The battle for second place in the race was MotoGP at its finest , as Repsol Honda man Pedrosa exchanged overtaking moves in the middle third of the 24 laps .
Pedrosa took third from out of nowhere , having had a storming start from the fourth row of the grid .
Ducati Marlboro rider Casey Stoner was unable to break away as he had done in Qatar , finishing fourth and keeping up the pressure in the general standings .
Andrea Dovizioso completed a fine day for Repsol Honda in fifth , ahead of Marco Melandri , Loris Capirossi , Mika Kallio , James Toseland and Chris Vermeulen .
Home rider Yuki Takahashi crashed out of the race in a collision with Nicky Hayden on the second lap .
NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory has found a cosmic " ghost " lurking around a distant supermassive black hole .
This is the first detection of such a high - energy apparition , and scientists think it is evidence of a huge eruption produced by the black hole .
This discovery presents astronomers with a valuable opportunity to observe phenomena that occurred when the Universe was very young .
The X - ray ghost , so - called because a diffuse X - ray source has remained after other radiation from the outburst has died away , is in the Chandra Deep Field - North , one of the deepest X - ray images ever taken .
The source , a.k.a.
HDF 130 , is over 10 billion light years away and existed at a time 3 billion years after the Big Bang , when galaxies and black holes were forming at a high rate .
" We 'd seen this fuzzy object a few years ago , but did n't realize until now that we were seeing a ghost " , said Andy Fabian of the Cambridge University in the United Kingdom .
" It 's not out there to haunt us , rather it 's telling us something - in this case what was happening in this galaxy billions of year ago . "
Fabian and colleagues think the X - ray glow from HDF 130 is evidence for a powerful outburst from its central black hole in the form of jets of energetic particles traveling at almost the speed of light .
When the eruption was ongoing , it produced prodigious amounts of radio and X - radiation , but after several million years , the radio signal faded from view as the electrons radiated away their energy .
However , less energetic electrons can still produce X - rays by interacting with the pervasive sea of photons remaining from the Big Bang - the cosmic background radiation .
Collisions between these electrons and the background photons can impart enough energy to the photons to boost them into the X - ray energy band .
This process produces an extended X - ray source that lasts for another 30 million years or so .
" This ghost tells us about the black hole 's eruption long after it has died , " said co-author Scott Chapman , also of Cambridge University .
" This means we do n't have to catch the black holes in the act to witness the big impact they have . "
This is the first X - ray ghost ever seen after the demise of radio - bright jets .
Astronomers have observed extensive X - ray emission with a similar origin , but only from galaxies with radio emission on large scales , signifying continued eruptions .
In HDF 130 , only a point source is detected in radio images , coinciding with the massive elliptical galaxy seen in its optical image .
This radio source indicates the presence of a growing supermassive black hole .
" This result hints that the X - ray sky should be littered with such ghosts , " said co-author Caitlin Casey , also of Cambridge , " especially if black hole eruptions are as common as we think they are in the early Universe . "
The power contained in the black hole eruption was likely to be considerable , equivalent to about a billion supernovas .
The energy is dumped into the surroundings and transports and heats the gas .
" Even after the ghost disappears , most of the energy from the black hole 's eruption remains " , said Fabian .
" Because they 're so powerful , these eruptions can have profound effects lasting for billions of years . "
The details of Chandra 's data of HDF 130 helped secure its true nature .
For example , in X - rays , HDF 130 has a cigar - like shape that extends for some 2.2 million light years .
The linear shape of the X - ray source is consistent with the shape of radio jets and not with that of a galaxy cluster , which is expected to be circular .
The energy distribution of the X - rays is also consistent with the interpretation of an X - ray ghost .

Cheney endorses Limbaugh
Improving the party 's image is a worthy cause , but it is n't what Republicans ought to be emphasizing right now .
They have a more important mission : to be the party of no .
And not just a party that bucks Obama and Democrats on easy issues like releasing Gitmo terrorists in this country , but one committed to aggressive , attention - grabbing opposition to the entire Obama agenda .
Many Republicans recoil from being combative adversaries of a popular president .
They should n't .
Opposing Obama across - the - board on his sweeping domestic initiatives makes sense on substance and politics .
His policies -- on spending , taxes , health care , energy , intervention in the economy , etc. -- would change the country in ways most Americans do n't believe in .
That 's the substance .
And a year or 18 months from now , after those policies have been picked apart and exposed and possibly defeated , the political momentum is likely to have shifted away from Obama and Democrats .
The party of Lincoln , as it occasionally tries to brand itself when it notices that likely black voters are in the room , would horrify the 16th President .
The “ base ” of the Republican party is a handful of uber - wealthy patricians who want to protect their inherited privilege at any cost ... a handful of anti-Castro Miami Cubans who all claim to have spent time in Castro ’s jails for political reasons , and a big mass of pork - rind eating , truck nutz sporting , bitter sons of Jefferson Davis .
I had to laugh when I saw James Carville talking -- Rove - like -- about how the Democrats would stay in power until 2049 and even sillier is the notion that the GOP could crumble completely and make way for a new mainstream party , Whigs Libertarians , or otherwise .
On the other hand , the shrinking congressional GOP rump sure seems to be working hard to guarantee the party 's demise .
And the media creatures who have served them so well in spreading their twisted vision of America , particularly , Rush Limbaugh , seems to have painted them into an untenable corner , one that works well for someone looking for ad sales in a minutely fractionalized radio market but not one that works when you 're interested in appealing to the American mainstream .
Today right - wing hack Fred Barnes placed himself firmly in the Limbaugh camp , urging more of the obstructionism that has brought GOP polling numbers to an all time low and costing them an upstate NY congressional seat where there are 70,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats .
That Obama 's policies are what Americans want , need and deserve seems never have occurred to Barnes .
Nor would it .
Barnes is a hopeless shill for all that has brought the GOP to the brink of extinction .
If you did n't hit that Libertarian link above , let me quote what our Libertarian friend had to say about what 's left of the Republican coalition : Barnes writes for the patricians with the inherited privilege .
After all , that is the heart of all right - wing parties before they get taken over by their sociopathic allies and turn completely fascist .
Like Barnes , Cheney has also aligned himself with Limbaugh .
On CBS'today , when asked about Colin Powell 's mild rebuke of Limbaugh 's suicidal extremism , Cheney made it clear once again why he is the most loathed figure in American politics :
" If I had to choose in terms of being a Republican , I 'd choose Rush Limbaugh , " Cheney said when asked about whose vision of the GOP he 'd side with .
" My impression was that Colin was no longer a Republican .
" Earlier today we took a look at the disintegration of Pakistan .
What we did n't get into is the crucial role religious extremism has played in the collapse of civil society .
If you believe -- have faith -- in God being on your side , you can do anything -- even murder women and children because ... well GOD is on your side and that 's what HE wants .
And there are American politicians as eager to use narrowly - based religious bigotry as the Taliban are .
You think I 'm exaggerating ?
On Thursday a gaggle of far right extremists introduced a resolution ( H. Con. Res 121 ) demanding that President Obama designate 2010 " The National Year of the Bible . "
So which imbciles never bothered reading the Constitution and know nothing about the history of intermingling religion and government ?
The resolution was the brainchild of Georgia racist and Know Nothing Paul Broun and is being co-sponsored by one of the most sickening lists of fellow demagogues and obstructionists : Lynn Westmoreland ( R - GA ) , John Carter ( R - TX ) , Randy Forbes ( R- VA ) , John Gingrey ( R- GA ) , Zach Wamp ( R - TN ) , Todd Akin ( R - MO ) , Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) , Mike Pence ( R- IN ) , Louis Gohmert ( R - TX ) , Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Jim Jordan ( R- OH ) , Doug Lamborn ( R- CO ) , and Kenny Marchant ( R - TX ) .
Unfortunately they do n't have remedial history classes for members of Congress .
Instead they get all the info they need from Rush Limbaugh .

As an anchor on Eastern and Southern Caribbean itineraries -- not to mention a turnaround port for many ships -- San Juan is a place where just about all cruisers , at some point or another , are going to wind up .
Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory , and San Juan is its urban hub .
The city , by and large , is divided into “ nuevo ” and “ old ” .
The new includes a business district and outlying neighborhoods , concentrated with hotel chains like Isla Verde .
The old is , of course , the historic city within ancient walls .
Both offer many Americanisms .
( Senor Frogs has a prime outpost , and you 'll never want for a McDonald 's Big Mac . )
Get beyond that , though , because of all America 's Caribbean islands , Puerto Rico offers the most exotic aura .
The melange of indigenous Taino culture , combined with European and African influences in San Juan ( and all of Puerto Rico , for that matter ) , is one major factor .
Add to that its own unique influences in areas , ranging from cuisine to music and from history to art .
And there 's more : folks who have traveled to Cuba say that Old San Juan reminds them more of Cuba , at times , than Cuba itself !
It 's also very Spanish ( think Seville ) and even a bit Italian ( reminiscent of Naples ) .
Finally , the city evokes just a wee taste of South America ( like Buenos Aires ) .
For those who visit San Juan as a day - stop on a Caribbean itinerary or embark or disembark there , the island 's biggest appeal is the old city .
Most cruise ships dock right in the heart of Old San Juan , which dates back to the 16th century .
The old , walled city has been exquisitely preserved , and its sprawling forts , cobblestone streets , antique shops and art galleries make it an ideal first stop .
Its mainstream attractions include the imposing El Morro fort , which dates back to 1539 ; the Cathedral of San Juan , where the island 's first governor , Ponce de Leon , is buried ; La Fortaleza , the oldest governor 's mansion on U.S. soil ; several colonial plazas ; and the triumvirate of Calle del Cristo , Calle San Jose and Calle Fortaleza for shopping .
Calle del Cristo , in particular , is chock - full of art galleries , artisan studios and distinctive boutiques .
But , if you 're a " been there , done that " visitor to Old San Juan , there 's much more to explore .
And there 's one more thing to keep in mind : many cruises stay in port until late at night .
That makes it possible to sample some of the city 's vibrant restaurants and nightlife ( as long as you keep an eye on the clock ) .
Medalla Light is the local beer , and while Bacardi is the better - known rum produced in Puerto Rico , the locals prefer Don Q -- an equally ( if not more ) venerable brand .
For a great thirst quencher , try the signature drink at the hip Marmalade restaurant ; the M317 martini consists of Cointreau jelly , limoncello , triple sec , Campari and grapefruit espuma ( a whipped cream without eggs ) .
Top - notch bottles of Bacardi or Don Q rum are great souvenir ideas .
We also love the artisan crafts that are showcased at the Plaza Arturo Somohano in downtown Old San Juan .
( While artisans vary , products include hand - tooled leather belts , gorgeous sea-glass jewelry and herbal soaps . )
Spanish and English are the official languages of Puerto Rico .
In tourist areas , English predominates .
Since Puerto Rico is an American territory , the currency there is the U.S. dollar .
ATM's are widely available throughout Old San Juan and in tourist beach resort areas .
Ships dock in two places .
The best location is just across from the Sheraton Old San Juan ( formerly known as the Wyndham ) because you walk off the ship into the heart of the old city .
Other times , your ship will dock just across the bay -- a stone 's throw away -- but it 's farther than it looks , and you 'll need to take a taxi to get anywhere .
Old San Juan , is undergoing an awesome renaissance .
If you have n't been there lately , you 'll be amazed at how beautiful and spiffed - up its European - esque buildings are , particularly the many that are freshly painted in cheerful pastels of lavender , blue , yellow and pink .
The Latino music phenomenon has led to the rebirth of new , fresh " nuevo Latino " cuisine , which , in turn , is attracting more attention to the island 's quality art , crafts and antiques . :
It 's walking distance into compact , yet fascinating , Old San Juan .
Streets are uneven ( constructed of blue cobblestones , cast from furnace slag ) , and hills are steep , so wear comfortable shoes . :
They 're available at the dock .
You can also hail mini-buses ( called " omnibuses " ) , which shuttle along main routes ; to hail one , respond with a wave when the driver toots his horn . :
There 's a free trolley that will take you around Old San Juan and to the forts .
You can pick it up across from the information booth , between cruise piers three and four . : Rental car agencies , such as Hertz ( 800-654-3131 ) and Avis ( 800-831-2847 ) , operate out of Condado ( about five miles from Old San Juan ) .
Sidewalks in Old San Juan are narrow and uneven .
When more than one ship is in town , they 're almost impassible .
Also , beware that crowds do inspire pickpockets ; keep an eye on your wallet .
Shopping in .
While San Juan is not a duty - free port , at least its stuff is n't taxed .
You 'll certainly find plenty of craft and T - shirt shops ( particularly along Fortaleza and San Francisco Streets ) .
One tip : the further east you walk ( going away from the cruise pier ) , the more interesting the shops and restaurants become .
One great street for window shopping is ; highlights include Magia ( 99 Calle Cristo ) , an artisan who crafts works of art from recycled objects -- old mirrors , wooden shutters , antique windows and even pocket - sized religious icons .
Prices start at $ 15 for one - of - a - kind pieces .
And , while not exactly exotic , we 've had good luck at factory stores for Ralph Lauren , Coach and Gant on Calle Cristo .
Sunny Caribbee ( 154 Calle Cristo ) is an offshoot of the Tortola classic and features crafts , hot sauces and coffees , made from Puerto Rican recipes ; across the hall , El Galapon has gorgeous masks .
A new find on our most recent visit to Old San Juan was the pocket - sized .
Just a block behind the Sheraton Old San Juan ( located at pier central ) , this tree - shaded park is home to artisans , who sell hand - made and designed crafts .
They must be approved by the government to open stalls ( no “ made in China ” stuff here ) .
While vendors vary , on my trip , there were beautifully scented soaps from ( the anise lavender is a favorite ) , hand - tooled leather belts , pretty ( and reasonably priced ) beach - glass jewelry , gourds and coconut shells and charming , hand - made , burlap handbags .
Check out the historic sites of Old San Juan , such as ( tours from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. , entry fee for adults ) , whose original parts were completed in 1539 ( and which successfully deterred would - be colonial powers from capturing the island ) .
Also on Old San Juan is ( tours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ) , which was built in 1771 .
On weekends , the grounds of both forts are thick with locals flying kites .

Chinese manufacturer Foxconn Electronics is reportedly in the running to produce an Apple netbook .
The news comes to us via DigiTimes , which cites the Chinese - language newspaper Commercial Times , which cites sources " from the component supply chain . "
That 's not exactly reliable firsthand knowledge , but it 's probably enough to keep some hopeful for an Apple netbook .
We have been skeptical of previous rumors about an Apple netbook , but if there was any time for Apple to cash in on the netbook craze , now would be it .
Not only would netbooks appeal to those looking for something ultra-portable or just less than $ 1,000 , many schools are seriously considering netbooks to fill their computing needs during a time of heavily slashed budgets .
For its part , AppleInsider is confident that the device is actually a long - rumored tablet - like device expected to be some soft of iPhone - MacBook hybrid , running Mac OS X but with a touch interface .
Apple has in fact filed a patent for such a user interface last year .
It seems like even a low - end , MacBook mini type of netbook would serve a larger market than something like a giant iPhone or iPod touch .
Still , it would be surprising if Apple just released a tiny , less - expensive MacBook .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs told analysts last year that the company has " got some pretty interesting ideas if [ the netbook market ] does evolve , " and COO Tim Cook echoed those words at Apple 's last quarterly earnings call .
If Apple does have something to release , expect it to change the way we think about netbooks altogether .
Fathers ' mental health problems can affect their children Children whose fathers have mental health disorders are likely to have psychiatric or behavioural disorders themselves , researchers warn .
University of Oxford experts reviewed existing evidence and said , in the Lancet , there had been too much focus on mothers ' mental health issues .
They said boys in particular could be affected if their father had depression or was an alcoholic .
Mental health campaigners said men often had problems seeking help .
Alcoholism The Oxford team said it was not surprising much of researchers ' emphasis had focused on mothers as , in most societies , it is mothers who provide the majority of childcare - particularly when children are very young .
But they said the role of men had been " underemphasised " and that they had more influence on their children 's development than previously thought .
In addition , the peak age for men to be affected by psychiatric disorders is the same as the peak age for becoming a father - between 18 and 35 .
In years gone by , if fathers were depressed and distant it may not have made much of an impact
Emily Wooster , Mind Paternal depression during the postnatal period , measured at eight weeks after birth , has been associated with increasing the chance of the child subsequently developing behavioural and emotional problems from 10 % to 20 % .
Teenage offspring of depressed fathers also have an increased risk of various psychological problems , including depression and suicidal behaviour .
Around 2 % of men are affected by generalised anxiety disorder , and children whose parents have anxiety disorders have a two - fold increased risk of developing such disorders themselves , researchers say .
Previous studies have also found links between a father 's alcoholism and an increased risk of conduct disorders , where children behave aggressively and destructively and abuse substances - particularly in sons .
Paternal alcoholism is also associated with an increased risk of mood disorders , depressive symptoms , poor performance at school , low self - esteem and problems forming relationships .
Adolescents whose parents have bipolar disorder are up to 10 times more likely than adolescents with mentally healthy parents to develop bipolar disorder , and three to four times more likely to develop other psychiatric illness , research suggests .
' Nurturing role '
The Oxford team , led by psychiatrist Professor Paul Ramchandani , said more research was needed on how fathers ' psychiatric disorders affect their children 's development .
He said : " Fathers are more involved in child - rearing in countries including the UK than they used to be .
" In years gone by , if fathers were depressed and distant it may not have made much of an impact .
" We now need a more general understanding of what effects psychiatric problems in fathers can have on children . "
Emily Wooster , policy and campaign manager for the mental health charity Mind , said : " Men 's roles in bringing up children have changed significantly over the last century , with many dads now taking on an active ' nurturing role ' so it 's important that there is more research into the relationship between fathers ' mental health problems and how these may affect their children .
" Mind has found that men often have difficulties coming forward and talking about their mental health problems , perhaps because of the way they are socialised into being ' strong , tough men ' who can't show their emotions . "
She said the charity was due to launch a campaign next week calling for " male - friendly " mental health services and better support for men .

How would you react to someone who tried to sell you a car that runs on fresh air ?
Perhaps you would think he was peddling a potentially planet - saving technology .
More likely you would dismiss him as a conman or a fantasist .
Yet that is precisely the pitch being made by French auto engineer Guy Negre , a good - humoured man in his mid-60s who claims to have developed a car powered by compressed air : one that produces a fraction of the carbon emissions of a standard engine , reaches speeds of 30 m ph - plus , that can travel 65 miles on a one - minute recharge and , best of all , costs from just over £ 3,000 .
Negre is quick to point out the drawbacks of existing eco-car technology .
" Hybrids are only marginally less polluting than the most efficient combustion engines , " he says .
" Hydrogen power is expensive and impractical .
Fuel cells are expensive and unproven and electric cars are reliant on expensive , unreliable battery technology . "
Given the number of false green - auto dawns , you might wonder why air - powered cars should be any different .
While Negre 's air cars have similar carbon emissions to electric cars ( it all depends how the electricity to power the pumps that fill their air tanks is generated ) , he argues that air - power is a superior technology .
" Compared to electric cars , air - powered cars cost a fraction of the price to buy , they do n't need expensive batteries to be replaced every five years or so and crucially they take only a fraction of the time to recharge . "
Negre previously designed racing engines for Renault and has devoted the last 13 years to developing compressed air technology at his factory in Carros , outside Nice , in southern France .
He believes air power has a real chance of putting a rocket up the $ 2tn - a - year global auto industry , radically improving the quality of urban life and making a serious dent in global carbon emissions in the process .
I confess I was so sceptical that I reserved judgment until I had driven one of his cars .
On the day I visited the factory , most of the cars were at Schipol airport in Amsterdam , where from next month they are being trialled as replacements for the huge fleet of electric service vehicles operated by Air France KLM .
So the version I drove was an early prototype , a three - wheeler with no bodywork , steered by a joystick .
OK , it did n't deliver the smoothly upholstered power so beloved by conventional car enthusiasts .
And it possessed all the glamour of a souped - up lawnmower .
But it worked , easily reaching speeds above 25 mph in the limited space of the factory car park , which doubles as a test track .
In full - scale production , air - powered vehicles will range from three - wheeled buggies to a four - wheeled , five - door family saloon .
Although the number of models on offer now is limited for cost reasons , they could eventually include vans , buses , taxis and boats .
The cars are made of fibreglass , which is lighter and 10 times stronger than steel , claims Negre .
The compressed air is stored at high pressure in shatter - proof thermoplastic tanks surrounded by a carbon - fibre shell .
( The same tanks used to contain the fuel in gas - powered buses . )
The air is released through pistons in the engine , which drive the wheels .
Unlike conventional internal combustion engines , air - powered engines run very cold and thick ice quickly forms on the engine .
This means that the only feature that comes for free in the air car will be air - conditioning .
Each car has an onboard pump that can refill the tank overnight .
But Negre has also developed a high - pressure air pump - imagine a heavy - duty version of the tyre pumps found on a garage forecourt - that can fill the tanks in less than a minute .
These could be powered by clean electricity - hydro , wind or solar - making the air car completely pollution - free .
Even if carbon - generated electricity is used , CO2 emissions are still only 10 % of a petrol engine 's , claims Negre .
That 's great for urban driving where journeys are typically a few miles .
For longer journeys there 's a hybrid , battery - assisted version , which Negre claims can reach 100 mph and travel 900 miles on one gallon of petrol .
Clearly the idea is being taken seriously by KLM .
Independent energy experts are also cautiously optimistic .
" I 've looked at this technology and it can work , " says Ulf Bossel , a sustainable energy consultant and organiser of the European Fuel Cell Forum .
" It looks good over 50 km or so .
I see no reason why this should n't be a successful form of urban transport in the near future . "
But perhaps the most credible endorsement of air power comes from a £ 30 m deal the makers recently signed with Indian car giant Tata to license the technology in Asia for use in the ultra-cheap Nano .
Negre has also signed deals to manufacture the car in the US , Latin America , and several European countries , but none as yet in the UK .
However , he says he is close to sealing an agreement that could see air cars on sale in the UK within three years .
But if cars running on fresh air fulfil their promise , why stop there ?
With just a few alterations , Negre claims a hybrid version of his new engine could even be used to power aircraft .
We 've gotten our hands on some footage that appears to be for Ubisoft 's Beyond Good & Evil 2 , the sequel to the underappreciated 2003 title .
The footage shows a woman dressed very much like Jade was dressed in the 2008 announcement teaser for Beyond Good & Evil 2 , running through a rundown looking town , avoiding police , climbing on top of a building and then making her ultimate escape via an orange helicopter .
The visuals certainly match what little we 've seen of the game so far .

Have you been watching the news at all recently ?
If so , you ’ve probably heard the term “ Swine Flu ” or “ H1N1 Flu ” bouncing around a lot .
While most people come down with the normal human flu at some point , it ’s not really a danger to anyone but the very young and the very old .
Why is this flu different and what does it have to do with pigs ?
Essentially , influenza ( aka , “ The Flu ” ) is a viral infection that attacks our population in a yearly cycle .
Fortunately , the human immune system is there to recognize and neutralize the effects of the virus .
Each year , the virus mutates just slightly and most of the population is once again susceptible to the disease .
This is why a new vaccine must be created regularly to reflect the most recent influenza mutants out in the environment .
Under normal circumstances , this is all you need to know about the flu ( aside from how to avoid infection and take care of yourself if you do come down with it ) .
Recently , some changes in the status quo have raised alarm bells at the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
There have been reports of “ swine flu ” in Mexico and several other countries whose citizens regularly visit Mexico , including the United States .
Since this is a general information article and not a “ minute by minute ” report , refer to major news outlets for more accurate information regarding confirmed cases .
As of this moment , though , it looks like over 80 deaths in Mexico are the result of contact with swine flu and there have been confirmed cases of the new pathogen in New York , Ohio , Kansas , California , and possibly other states .
Putting the news figures aside for a moment , let me explain exactly what swine flu is .
The influenza virus has a number of components , but the most variable parts of the virus are the spines found around its exterior .
These are proteins called “ peplomers ” and there are two major kinds .
The HA ( hemagglutinin ) peplomer is responsible for binding the virus to host cells and the NA ( neuraminidase ) peplomer allows the virus to break its bonds to the host cell once it is ready to move on .
When you hear about the H1N1 virus or the H3N2 virus , the viruses are being referred to and classified by their external receptors .
This is a bit of a simplification , but knowing the chemical nature of the peplomers is n’t crucial to understanding their function .
The peplomers are a double edged sword .
They allow the viral particles access to the machinery of the cell ( this is how viruses replicate themselves ) , but they also allow the immune system to recognize and target the virus .
When the human flu virus mutates its external proteins , the body ’s defenses still recognize them and eventually mount a response ( the period of sickness occurs while the body is developing that response ) .
If this failed to happen , you would eventually succumb to the virus and die .
The virus did n’t originate in humans , though .
Birds , pigs , and even horses have their own versions of influenza .
Remember the “ bird flu ” or “ avian flu ” scare a while ago ?
Scientists feared the influenza common in birds had “ jumped the species barrier ” and begun infecting humans .
This is called a “ zoonotic ” disease – a disease that moves from animals to people .
Now , the same worries have arisen about swine flu .
Why does this matter ?
Wo n’t our immune system just deal with the new influenza virus the same way it has always done with the seasonal one ?
Unfortunately the answer is a weak “ maybe . ”
While your immune system might not immediately stop a new human influenza infection , it DOES recognize that new mutant and begin building a response .
Avian and swine peplomers , on the other hand , are not easily recognized by the human system because our evolution did not include pressure from those particular viruses .
As humans have come into close contact with the animals that carry these viruses , the animal influenza has been able to mutate enough to cross the species bridge and infect humans as well .
In the past this would not have been a global problem .
An infected village might just die out in isolation .
Things are different now : a traveler can become infected in one region and fly thousands of miles to another , long before they experience symptoms .
So what ’s the take away message from all of this ?
Can we do anything about this ?
Well as individuals it ’s wise to go through the same sanitary practices as we might during flu season .
Also , traveling to places which have reported cases probably is n’t a great idea .
Governments and regulatory bodies like the CDC and the WHO are in an “ all hands on deck ” kind of status right now .
As the outbreaks continue ( they are expected to grow for at least the time being ) , these groups will be tracking any reported cases and trying to treat those infected .
As a young microbiologist , I ’d say that for the moment we should n’t worry too much .
There are people who have spent their whole lives preparing for just these kinds of events and they ’re currently working very hard to provide the public with the best information and advice .
Hopefully you now have a better understanding of the science behind influenza and zoonotic diseases .
I ’ve put some links at the bottom of this posting for further reading .
Also , feel free to post a comment or @me on Twitter should you have any more questions .
Update : The World Health Organisation says that the Swine Influenza virus , or “ Swine Flu ” will now be named the Influenza A( H1N1 ) or just H1N1 flu .

Singlet carbenes exhibit a divalent carbon atom whose valence shell contains only six electrons , four involved in bonding to two other atoms and the remaining two forming a non-bonding electron pair .
These features render singlet carbenes so reactive that they were long considered too short - lived for isolation and direct characterization .
This view changed when it was found that attaching the divalent carbon atom to substituents that are bulky and / or able to donate electrons produces carbenes that can be isolated and stored1 .
N - heterocyclic carbenes are such compounds now in wide use , for example as ligands in metathesis catalysis2 .
In contrast , oxygen - donor - substituted carbenes are inherently less stable and have been less studied .
The pre-eminent case is hydroxymethylene , H–C–OH ; although it is the key intermediate in the high - energy chemistry of its tautomer formaldehyde3,4,5,6,7 , has been implicated since 1921 in the photocatalytic formation of carbohydrates8 , and is the parent of alkoxycarbenes that lie at the heart of transition - metal carbene chemistry , all attempts to observe this species or other alkoxycarbenes have failed9 .
However , theoretical considerations indicate that hydroxymethylene should be isolatable10 .
Here we report the synthesis of hydroxymethylene and its capture by matrix isolation .
We unexpectedly find that H–C–OH rearranges to formaldehyde with a half - life of only 2 h at 11 K by pure hydrogen tunnelling through a large energy barrier in excess of 30 kcal mol–1 .

When asked over dinner whether she felt guilty that Brennan had taken so much upon himself , his mother , Caryn , began to cry .
“ We did n’t expect to end up in this situation , ” she said .
Tuition , board and other expenses at Berkeley are estimated at $ 27,000 a year .
Last year , the family ’s income was $ 58,000 , when Ms. Jackson ’s wages from teaching were combined with revenue from a part of a rental property .
The family cannot sell the property because it does not own it outright , and Ms. Campbell believes that the investment reduced the direct aid Brennan might have received .
Brennan ’s father , Aaron , who was laid off as an accountant more than a year ago , acknowledged that his son had few options .

Farouk Hosny has been Egypt 's top cultural official since 1987 Doubts still surround the prospects for Egypt 's candidate to lead Unesco , the UN 's cultural arm , despite his public apology for past anti-Israeli remarks .
Farouk Hosny , who is Egypt 's culture minister , expressed " solemn regret " over a May 2008 pledge to burn Israeli books in Egyptian libraries .
Israel withdrew its protest about Mr Hosny 's candidature following a request from Egypt's President , Hosni Mubarak .
But Jewish European cultural groups continued to object to the candidacy .
Opponents of Mr Hosny 's candidature have cited his response to a question in parliament in May 2008 from an opposition MP about whether Israeli books were held by the new library in Alexandria .
He said : " Burn these books ; if there are any there , I will myself burn them in front of you . "
' Man of peace ' Writing in the French newspaper Le Monde on Wednesday , Mr Hosny said : " I want to solemnly say that I regret the words that I used . "
Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel has led protests against Hosny 's candidature " I am a man of peace .
I know that peace comes through understanding and respect .
In the name of these values I want to go back on the words that I used , which were taken as an appeal to burn Hebrew books . "
He admitted that his words had been shocking , but he said they had not been premeditated but had shown his indignation about the " tragic " plight of Palestinians .
He added that he abhorred " racism , negating others or any move to harm Jewish culture or any culture " .
At the time , Mr Hosny said he had used a popular expression in Egypt to indicate that something did not exist .
The Wiesenthal Centre said the book - burning statement was redolent of " the language and actions of Nazi ' Minister of Culture ' Josef Goebbels " .
' Insane ' declarations
The exact details of the deal Benjamin Netanyahu struck when he met Hosni Mubarak have not been disclosed , but officials confirmed Israel 's U - turn which came before Mr Hosny 's apology .

An open letter by prominent Jewish intellectuals Claude Lanzmann , Bernard - Henri Levy and Elie Wiesel protested against Mr Hosny 's candidature in the strongest terms .
They said the book burning comment was just one of many " insane declarations ... of hate and error " accompanying a " frenzy of conspiracy theories " that Mr Hosny had made .
They quoted him saying in 2001 : " Israeli culture is an inhuman culture ... aggressive , racist , pretentious ... based on a simple principle , stealing that which does not belong to it and then claiming it as its own . "
Egypt signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979 , which has brought political , security and economical contacts , but Egyptian cultural figures have largely shunned any co-operation with Israelis .
Hosny , a 71 - year - old abstract artist who is believed to be close to President Mubarak , has been Egyptian culture minister for more than 20 years .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Four men accused by prosecutors of being " eager to bring death to Jews " were ordered held without bail Thursday , accused of trying to bomb two New York synagogues and planning to fire surface - to - air missiles at U.S. military planes .
Three of the suspects are taken away by authorities after the arrests were made .
The plot ended with federal agents and New York police using an 18 - wheel truck to block the vehicle containing the suspects after they planted what they believed were explosive devices in cars near the synagogues Wednesday night , said New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly .
The devices were duds .
All four suspects are accused of plotting to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and seeking to fire missiles at planes at an Air National Guard base .
Kelly described the plot as homegrown , with no known links to any foreign or domestic groups .
The plot was uncovered in a yearlong investigation involving an FBI informant , authorities said .
At a court hearing Thursday , three of the suspects -- James Cromitie , David Williams and Onta Williams -- shook their heads as prosecutors appealed to U.S. Magistrate Lisa Smith to order them held without bail .
Prosecutor Eric Snyder described the suspects as violent men " eager to bring death to Jews . "
Watch police commissioner give details on suspects »
Smith ordered the three to remain in custody without bail until their next court appearance on June 5 .
Smith also approved a request by Cromitie , accused of being the ringleader , for medical care for cuts he said he received from flying glass during the arrest .

After the hearing , Cromitie 's lawyer , Vincent Briccetti , declined to comment on the case .
At a later hearing , the fourth suspect , Laguerre Payen , also was remanded without bail .
Payen received medical treatment for injuries he suffered during the arrest and had a bandage over one eye at his hearing .
Payen 's lawyer said her client had a history of mental instability , but Snyder , the prosecutor , said videotapes of the suspects showed Payen to be a coherent and willing participant .
Payen told the judge he has prescriptions for the drugs Celexa and Seroquel .
Celexa is used to treat depression and Seroquel is used to treat conditions including bipolar disorder .
Cromitie , David Williams and Onta Williams are U.S. citizens , while Payen is a Haitian , according to the New York governor 's office .
Police said three of the suspects have prior criminal records and all were believed to consider themselves Muslim .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the work of his city 's police department and federal authorities in uncovering the alleged plot .
" The good news here is that the New York Police Department and FBI did exactly what they 're trained to do and prevented what could have been a terrible event , " Bloomberg said .
" We have to constantly be vigilant . "
At the targeted sites on Thursday , worshippers said they were relieved that the plot was halted , but they did n't intend to change their daily routines .
" Unfortunately , this is the world we live in , " said Nurit Bacharach of the Gan Miriam Early Childhood Center at the Hebrew Institute in Riverdale .
" We just have to forge ahead and keep a positive mind and live life and just be cautious and aware . "
According to New York and federal authorities , an FBI informant met with Cromitie in June 2008 in Newburgh , New York .
During that meeting Cromitie said his parents lived in Afghanistan , he was angry about the U.S. war there , and he had an interest in " doing something to America . "
Watch suspects ' possible motivation »
The four suspects began meeting and plotting to bomb the synagogues with the informant at a home equipped with concealed video and audio equipment , authorities said .
The suspects also conducted surveillance , including photographs , of an Air National Guard base where they wanted to blow up planes , authorities said .
The informant provided the men with a surface - to - air guided missile and C - 4 plastic explosives , none of which could actually be used .
" No one was at risk , " said Kelly , the police commissioner , describing the explosive devices as duds created to dupe the suspects .
Kelly said that after the suspects planted the 37 - pound devices in two cars , a waiting contingent of officers pulled an 18 - wheeler across the road to block the suspects ' vehicle and then smashed their windows to apprehend them without a struggle .
The charges against the men include conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in the United States and conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles .
The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison .

Since today is Memorial Day I decided to create a couple of dishes that are perfect for grilling out .
I am going to make a Pepperjack and Jalapeno stuffed burger topped with a spicy mayo and a quick pickle of onions and jalapenos .
I call it my “ Two Steps From Hell Burger ” .
The burger is very spicy .
Since corn is in season and the local Giant has 12 ears for 1.88 , I figured I would grill up some corn .
Grilling corn sounds easy but to get it right takes some work .
Most people do n’t grill it for long enough , or else they grill it too long and it becomes chewy .
Neither are good eats .
The Two Steps From Hell Burger served with Grilled Corn
Two steps from Hell Burger – ( makes 2 half pound burgers )
1 lb ground beef – Preferably 70/30 as anything else is too lean and you will end up with a dry burger .
1 jalapeno pepper
6 slices of pepperjack cheese
salt and pepper
peppered bacon
spicy mayo
pickled onions and jalapenos
To make the burgers , portion the meat into four equal pieces .
Roughly 4ozs each .
You do n’t have to weigh the burgers but I was portioning out 3 lbs of meat so weighing made it easier
Then roll each piece into a ball .
Then flatten each of the balls to make four even patties .
I would say that they are roughly 3.5 - 4 inches in diameter .
Then season the patties with salt and pepper .
3.5 - 4in. patty
Take one patty and place the pepper jack cheese in the middle .
You may have to cut the cheese slice and arrange it so that there is a half inch edge of meat around the cheese .
You need this barrier in order to seal the burger .
Then place 3 - 4 jalapeno rings on top of the cheese and top with one more slice of pepperjack .
Layer with cheese and jalapenos
Then place one of the remaining patties on top of the cheese layered patty .
Seal the edge of the burger with your fingers .
Make sure to make a tight seal or else the cheese will ooze out of the burger when it cooks .
Seal the patties all of the way around .
You do n’t want the stuffing to fall out during grilling .
Then grill the burgers over Medium / High heat until the burger is the desired temperature .
This is a thick burger .
For medium rare it took roughly 5 minutes on each side .
Make sure that you grates are heated before starting to grill the burger .
You want it to sear the outside to keep the stuffing on the inside .
You know your grates are hot enough when you can only put your hand above them for 3 - 4 seconds .
After you flip the burger wait 4 minutes then place another slice of pepperjack on the burger patty .
Close your grill lid and let the cheese melt before removing the burger .
Once you add your cheese close your grill lid so that it melts evenly .
Make sure to let the burger rest for 2 - 3 minutes before serving .
Grilled Corn
2 to infinite number of ears of corn – ( I do n’t have a grill big enough to cook infinite numbers but if you do send me a pic )
large bucket , bowl or pitcher
water
To make grilled corn I first pull back the outer husks to remove the corn silk .
Remove the Corn Silk
Then I layer the husks back over the corn .
At this point I remove the outer most husks leaving the inner bright green husks .
After removing the silk remove the outer most husk so that you are left with the bright green inner husks
Now place the inner husks back over the corn .
This will protect it from being over cooked .
Then I soak the ears for 30 - 60 minutes .
I find that pitchers work great for soaking corn .
They are the perfect shape and they are easy to handle when grilling .
Soak the corn for at least 30 minutes .
Once the corn is done soaking I drain the water from the container and then place the corn with the husks directly onto the grill .
This allows the corn to steam while it is being grilled .
This will help cook the corn without overly cooking it .
Second the husks protect the kernels from flare ups .
The husks will burn but the kernels do n’t .
I place the corn directly over the coals
You only need to rotate the corn 3 times .
When the husk starts to blacken , rotate the corn .
Usually about every 5 minutes .
Once you have made a full rotation of the corn it is done .
Remember chewy corn is bad corn .
You want it cooked but still a bit crunchy .
As you can see the husks burn off a bit , but leave the corn perfectly cooked .
Serve with butter and salt .
You can also add some chili pepper to butter and baste that over the corn .
Pickled Onion and Jalapenos – ( adapted from “ The Joy of Pickling ” )
1 medium red onion
4 jalapeno peppers
1/2 cup white distilled vinegar
1/2 cup water
1 tsp pickling or kosher salt
First slice the onion into thin onion rings or half rings .
Slice the jalapenos into 1/8 inch slices .
I slice them about 1/8th of an inch thick
Place the onion and jalapenos into a bowl and cover with boiling water for 1 minute .
I quickly blanch the onions and jalapenos for about a minute just to soften them a bit .
Drain and then add the vinegar , water and salt .
The onions pickup some of the heat of the jalapenos .
Delicious .
Let the onion and jalapenos pickle for an hour before serving .
Spicy Mayo
1 cup mayonaise
1 tsp hot sauce
1 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp salt
dash of pepper
1/2 tsp lemon juice
Combine all of the ingredients and stir .
Combine all of the ingredients and stir .
Let sit for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld before serving .
Once combined let sit and meld .
So tasty !!
This is great for any sandwich but it is especially awesome on burgers .
Peppered Bacon
4 strips of peppered bacon per burger
foil lined pan
cooling rack
The first step is to cook the bacon .
I like to bake my bacon in the oven .
It comes out looking nicer .
Set your oven to 400 .
Then you need a sheet pan lined with aluminum .
Then put a baking rack over the foil .
This is the ultimate way to improve the smell in your house .
Nothing says welcome to my house like the lingering smell of bacon .
I love bacon .
Then put the bacon in strips on the rack .
If you have a rack with grates you can push the bacon between the grates for a nice rippled look or else you can lay it flat .
Put in the oven for 20 - 30 minutes or until it is the desired crispyness .
By the way , the burgers only require 3 slices , I always cook and extra as I love bacon .
The ultimate treat .
Then after about 20 - 25 minutes remove from the oven and let it cool .
Assembly
Lay our your bun and spread the spicy mayo on both halves .
This will protect the bun from the grease of the burger .
The mayo acts as a protective barrier to help keep the bun from getting too mushy .
Then layer tomato and lettuce on the top half .
Remember to put the mayo on both halves as it protects the bun from soaking up too much of the juices .
On the bottom half layer the burger patty , pickled onions and jalapenos and the peppered bacon .
Gently place the top over the bottom half and you have created the two steps from hell burger .
Layer up the onions and jalapenos then top with bacon
Serve it with the grilled corn and you have the ultimate Memorial Day menu .
The perfect burger
Here is the burger cut in half .
How amazing does that look .
Look at the cheese and jalapenos oozing out of the middle of the burger .
Perfectly cooked medium rare , this burger is magnificent .
Quite possibly the spiciest and tastiest creation I have ever made .
Have a safe and happy memorial day .
I would also like to thank all of the troops for everything that they are doing for us .
Thanks again .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York student won a court order on Wednesday to temporarily freeze the assets of Peter Madoff , brother of jailed swindler Bernard Madoff , in a lawsuit over lost inheritance money .
A mug shot of Bernard Madoff released to Reuters on March 17 , 2009 .
REUTERS / United States Marshall Service / FOIA / Handout
Andrew Ross Samuels , 22 , of Brooklyn Law School , said in papers filed in a suburban New York court that he lost nearly $ 500,000 in inheritance money that was entrusted to Peter Madoff , who invested it in Bernard Madoff ’s scheme .
Madoff pleaded guilty on March 12 to running the biggest investment fraud in Wall Street ’s history , which prosecutors have said involved as much as $ 65 billion .
Madoff was sent to jail pending sentencing in June .
His brother , who was an executive of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , has not been charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors or regulators .
The lawsuit charged that Peter Madoff “ as chief compliance officer and senior managing director of BMIS had full knowledge that it was a fraudulent Ponzi scheme and nothing more than an unprecedented fraud . ”
Bernard Madoff confessed in court that he ran a classic Ponzi scheme , in which early investors were paid with money from new clients .
“ Samuels ’ grandfather passed away making Peter Madoff the trustee of a trust for him that ’s worth about $ 500,000 , and the money ai n’t there , ” said the lawyer , Steven Schlesinger .
“ When you are the trustee and the money ’s not there , it ’s per se liability . ”
He said the temporary freeze applied to “ everything he owns ” , but he did not know the total value of the assets of Peter Madoff , who was trustee of Samuels ’ money since 2003 .
The lawsuit seeks damages no less than the $ 478,009.95 said to have been in the trust .
A hearing was scheduled for April 3 in Nassau County State Supreme Court on New York ’s Long Island before Justice Stephen Bucaria , who signed the order on Wednesday .
According to court papers , the order said Madoff “ is prohibited and restrained from removing any funds ... from any bank , brokerage firm , or other institution wherever situated and without limitation . ”
A lawyer for Peter Madoff could not be reached for comment .

New York and London are consolidating and strengthening their positions atop the global financial system , according to the FT's John Pender .
The latest edition of the Global Financial Centres Index ( GFCI ) shows these two leading centers to be considerably more " resilient " than others , ranking as the world 's only " truly global financial centres . "
The GFCI , which is based on surveys of financial experts and professionals , rates financial centers on a point basis .
London was on top with a rating of 781 , followed by NY with 768 .
The ratings for these top financial centers fell only 10 and six points respectively since the onset of the crisis .
The global ocean plays a central role in Earth ’s climate system and has considerably slowed down climate change by taking up about one third of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emitted through human activities .
To what extent this will continue in the future depends on a variety of physical and chemical processes - and , as marine scientists from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences ( IFM - GEOMAR ) together with colleagues from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research ( Bremerhaven , Germany ) and the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research ( Warnemünde , Germany ) have now shown in an experiment with natural plankton communities , also depends on biological factors .
Atmospheric CO 2 enters the ocean at the sea surface .
To allow for continued uptake , it has to be transported to deeper layers .
“ One of the mechanisms responsible for this transport to depth is the biological carbon pump ” , explains Julia Wohlers from IFM - GEOMAR , the first author of the study , which has just been published in PNAS .
In spring , when temperatures rise and light conditions improve , planktonic algae start to build up biomass using CO 2 and nutrients .
After the algae have died , a fraction of this biomass sinks to greater depth – taking with it the photosynthetically bound carbon .
To investigate how this system will change in response to surface - ocean warming , the scientists from Kiel have enclosed natural plankton communities in eight tanks of 1,400 litres each .
The communities were exposed to different temperatures , which corresponded to the warming scenarios projected by the International Panel of Climate Change ( IPCC ) until the year 2100 .
In these “ miniature ecosystems ” the build - up and decline of the spring plankton bloom was monitored over a period of one month .
“ As expected , the metabolic rates of all components of the plankton community were accelerated with increasing temperature .
What came as a surprise to us was that the plankton consumed up to one third less CO 2 at elevated temperatures .
Ultimately , this may cause a weakening of the biological carbon pump ” , says Prof .
Ulf Riebesell from IFM - GEOMAR , the principal investigator of the study .
The reason for this weakening :
While the photosynthetic build - up of biomass by planktonic algae shows only a minor response to warming , its consumption by bacteria strongly increases with rising temperature .
This causes a greater portion of algal biomass to be degraded before it can sink to deeper waters .
Thus , more CO 2 is retained in the surface layer , which , in turn , will take up less CO 2 from the atmosphere .
“ This study underscores the importance to improve the incorporation of biological processes and feedbacks in Earth system models ” , Julia Wohlers points out .
For a global estimate of the magnitude of the observed feedback , however , it is still too early at this stage .
“ Data in this research area are still sparse and further research efforts are needed to fill this gap of knowledge ” , says Wohlers .

Good news people !
The US army has confirmed that Israel has their very own circumcised version of Dr Manhattan 's schlong .
Sources estimate a collection of 200 to 400 nuclear warheads .

After years of ignoring the Israeli nuclear program — which was denounced in 1986 by former nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu — the United States ' Department of Defense has acknowledged Israel nuclear power status for the first time .
Advertisement
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of its own nuclear arsenal , but page 37 of the US Joint Forces Command report recognizes the fact , putting it in the same group as Pakistan , India , China , North Korea , Russia , along with an " emerging Iran , " Taiwan , and Japan having " the capability to develop nuclear weapons quickly . "
According to " The Samson Option " report — an investigative article written by reporter Seymour Hersh — Israel may have 200 to 400 atomic warheads , ready to use as the last resort in case of a massive attack that may put in danger the existence of the country .
This is a big deal for two reasons :
First , because the subject has been dodged forever by the US government , including President Barack Obama , who recently ignored the question when asked by White House correspondent Helen Thomas .
And second , because to the Symington Amendment — which bans support to countries developing nuclear weapons — this may mean the end of US help to Israel .
Or maybe this just means that someone at the DOD will get fired and the report corrected with a big black marker .

It can go either way , and it will still be very bad news .

In the past year he 's been painting pictures , singing songs , and demonstrating his expert judo moves .
This week Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will complete a clean sweep of the artistic disciplines after turning his hand to writing .
Mr Putin 's first ever column for a Russian media outlet will be published on Friday , entitled " Why it 's hard to fire people " .
But while the previous efforts , along with his skiing , tiger - shooting and bare - chested fishing expeditions , have been propaganda for personal abilities , the article seems to have a more serious point .
Written for a niche monthly magazine , Russian Pioneer , it reads as the first admission by Mr Putin of the scale of infighting that raged in the Kremlin during his eight years as president .
" Conflicts within a team , especially within a big team , always arise , " writes Mr Putin , in extracts leaked to a Russian news agency .
" This happens every minute , every second – simply because between people there are always clashes of interest . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Most analysts believe that during Mr Putin 's presidency , a vicious battle was fought for power and influence between liberals and hardliners within and around the Kremlin .
This continues today as the relatively liberal President Dmitry Medvedev and his close associates appear to be fighting off challenges from a hardline group of conservative former KGB officers .
Mr Putin is sometimes lumped in with the latter group , but many analysts suggest that he actually played a delicate balancing act to stop the two groups from descending into all - out war .
The scuffles are rarely aired in public and Mr Putin himself has not made direct reference to them before .
But now he seems to confirm the most radical of interpretations .
" I can say honestly that while I was president , if I had n't interfered in certain situations , in Russia there would long ago ceased to have been a government . "
The magazine 's editor Andrei Kolesnikov said he had not had to make any corrections as the article was written in excellent Russian , albeit with Mr Putin 's famous idiosyncratic expressions in abundance .
For any corporate hotshots looking for tips on how to get rid of underachieving employees in times of economic crisis , the article lays out the " Putin method " of firing , which – on paper at least – sounds surprisingly humane .
" Sometimes from outside it seems like someone should simply be swept aside with a broom , " writes Mr Putin .
" But I can assure you that it 's not always like this .
You should never bad - mouth someone behind their back , and it 's impermissible to fire somebody and toss them aside just because somebody has told you something bad about them . "
Mr Putin also claims that he always gives people the right to fight their corner .
" In contrast to previous , Soviet rulers , I always do it personally .
I usually call the person into my office , look them in the eye , and say : ' There are concrete complaints .
If you think this is n't true , then please , you can fight against it ; argue your case ' . "

The whole -- enable - pthread thing
Ask any Ruby hacker how to easily increase performance in a threaded Ruby application and they ’ll probably tell you :
Yo dude …
Everyone knows you need to configure Ruby with -- disable - pthread .
And it ’s true ; configure Ruby with -- disable - pthread and you get a ~ 30 % performance boost .
But … why ?
For this , we ’ll have to turn to our handy tool strace .
We ’ll also need a simple Ruby program to this one .
How about something like this :
def make_thread Thread.new { a = [ ]
10_000_000.times { a << " a " a.pop } } end t = make_thread t1 = make_thread t.join t1.join
Now , let 's run strace on a version of Ruby configure 'd with -- enable - pthread and point it at our test script .
The output from strace looks like this :
22:46:16.706136 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706177 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706218 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706259 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000005 > 22:46:16.706301 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706342 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706383 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706425 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 > 22:46:16.706466 rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK , NULL , [ ] , 8 ) = 0 < 0.000004 >
Pages and pages and pages of sigprocmask system calls ( Actually , running with strace - c , I get about 20,054,180 calls to sigprocmask , WOW ) .
Running the same test script against a Ruby built with -- disable - pthread and the output does not have pages and pages of sigprocmask calls ( only 3 times , a HUGE reduction ) .
OK , so let 's just set a breakpoint in GDB ... right ?
OK , so we should just be able to set a breakpoint on sigprocmask and figure out who is calling it .
Well , not exactly .
You can try it , but the breakpoint wo n't trigger ( we 'll see why a little bit later ) .
Hrm , that kinda sucks and is confusing .
This will make it harder to track down who is calling sigprocmask in the threaded case .
Well , we know that when you run configure the script creates a config.h with a bunch of define s that Ruby uses to decide which functions to use for what .
So let 's compare ./ configure -- enable - pthread with ./ configure --disable - pthread :
[ joe@mawu:/home/joe/ruby ] % diff config.h config.h. pthread > # define _REENTRANT 1 > #define _THREAD_SAFE 1 > #define HAVE_LIBPTHREAD
1 > #define HAVE_NANOSLEEP
1 > #define HAVE_GETCONTEXT
1 > #define HAVE_SETCONTEXT
1
OK , now if we grep the Ruby source code , we see that whenever HAVE_ [ SG] ETCONTEXT are set , Ruby uses the system calls setcontext ( ) and getcontext ( ) to save and restore state for context switching and for exception handling ( via the EXEC_TAG ) .
What about when HAVE_ [ SG] ETCONTEXT are not define 'd ?
Well in that case , Ruby uses _setjmp / _longjmp .
Bingo !
That 's what 's going on !
From the _setjmp / _longjmp man page :
... The _longjmp ( ) and _setjmp ( ) functions shall be equivalent to longjmp ( ) and setjmp ( ) , respectively , with the additional restriction that _longjmp ( ) and _setjmp ( ) shall not manipulate the signal mask ...
And from the [ sg ] etcontext man page :
... uc_sigmask is the set of signals blocked in this context ( see sigprocmask ( 2 ) ) ...
The issue is that getcontext calls sigprocmask on every invocation but _setjmp does not .
BUT WAIT if that 's true why did n't GDB hit a sigprocmask breakpoint before ?
x86_64 assembly FTW , again
Let 's fire up gdb and figure out this breakpoint - not - breaking thing .
First , let 's start by disassembling getcontext ( snipped for brevity ) :
( gdb ) p getcontext
$ 1 = { } 0x7ffff7825100
( gdb ) disas getcontext
...
0x00007ffff782517 f : mov $ 0xe , %rax
0x00007ffff7825186 : syscall
...
Yeah , that 's pretty weird .
I 'll explain why in a minute , but let 's look at the disassembly of sigprocmask first :
( gdb ) p sigprocmask
$ 2 = { } 0x7ffff7817340
( gdb ) disas sigprocmask
...
0x00007ffff7817383 : mov $ 0xe , %rax
0x00007ffff7817388 : syscall
...
Yeah , this is a bit confusing , but here 's the deal .
Recent Linux kernels implement a shiny new method for calling system calls called sysenter / sysexit .
This new way was created because the old way ( int $ 0x80 ) turned out to be pretty slow .
So Intel created some new instructions to execute system calls without such huge overhead .
All you need to know right now ( I 'll try to blog more about this in the future ) is that the %rax register holds the system call number .
The syscall instruction transfers control to the kernel and the kernel figures out which syscall you wanted by checking the value in %rax .
Let 's just make sure that sigprocmask is actually 0xe :
[ joe@pluto:/usr / include ] % grep - Hrn " sigprocmask " asm-x86_64/unistd.h asm-x86_64/unistd.h:44:#define __NR_rt_sigprocmask 14
Bingo .
It 's calling sigprocmask ( albeit a bit obscurely ) .
OK , so getcontext is n't calling sigprocmask directly , instead it replicates a bunch of code that sigprocmask has in its function body .
That 's why we did n't hit the sigprocmask breakpoint ; GDB was going to break if you landed on the address 0x7 ffff7817340 but you did n't .
Instead , getcontext reimplements the wrapper code for sigprocmask itself and GDB is none the wiser .
Mystery solved .
The patch
Get it HERE
The patch works by adding a new configure flag called -- disable - ucontext to allow you to specifically disable [ sg ] etcontext from being called , you use this in conjunction with -- enable - pthread , like this :
./configure --disable-ucontext --enable - pthread
After you build Ruby configured like that , its performance is on par with ( and sometimes slightly faster ) than Ruby built with -- disable - pthread for about a 30 % performance boost when compared to -- enable - pthread .
I added the switch because I wanted to preserve the original Ruby behavior , if you just pass -- enable - pthread without -- disable - ucontext Ruby will do the old thing and generate piles of sigprocmasks .
Conclusion
Things are n't always what they seem - GDB may lie to you .
Be careful .
Use the source , Luke .
Libraries can do unexpected things , debug builds of libc can help !
I know I keep saying this , assembly is useful .
Start learning it today !

Karl Rove was nicknamed Bush 's brain Karl Rove , former aide to President Bush , has been questioned over the controversial firing of several government prosecutors in 2006 .
Mr Rove was interviewed by special prosecutor Nora Dannehy , but declined to comment afterwards , reports say .
Ms Dannehy is investigating whether criminal charges should be brought against those involved in the sackings .
The dismissal of the nine attorneys caused an outcry amid allegations it was politically motivated .
The justice department was then accused of attempting to mislead the public about the reasons for the dismissals .
The furore led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and several other senior aides .
Mr Rove - chief strategist in George W Bush 's two presidential election victories - was accused of knowing about the plans to fire the attorneys .
He refused to attend a congressional hearing into the allegations last year .
Although Mr Rove did not comment after Friday 's interview , a spokeswoman for his lawyer said he had co-operated with Ms Dannehy and tried to answer her questions , the Associated Press news agency reported .
' Serious allegations '
The row began when nine US attorneys were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006 .
At the time , the department said they had been fired for poor performance .
Serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved
Glenn Fine
Justice department inspector general
But it later emerged that those fired had not been rated any more poorly than many of their colleagues , leading many observers to conclude the sackings had been politically - motivated .
Some of the attorneys had been involved in the prosecution of high - profile Republican members of Congress , while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats .
US attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases for the government .
They can be dismissed at any time , but may not be removed for political reasons .
Nora Dannehy was appointed last September to lead the investigation by the attorney general after a report into the affair by the inspector general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials .
" Serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved , " Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report .

For Face Transplant Patients , Selection Criteria Could Stiffen in Future Selection criteria for face transplant patients may tighten up in the future .
May 22 , 2009  --
It 's a procedure so rare that only a handful of surgeons worldwide have any experience with it .
Patients are rarer still .
But as the number of successful face transplant surgeries inches ever higher , medical ethicists already are discussing how to make decisions on if and when patients should be eligible for the costly and complex procedure that some say represents the ultimate gift from a deceased donor 's family .
The issue of face transplantation garnered renewed interest on Thursday , when James Maki , 59 , the country 's second - ever face transplant recipient , appeared before reporters and cameras gathered at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
In 2005 , Maki lost much of his face to burns when he fell on the electrified third rail of a Boston subway track .
While the surgeries prior to the face transplant restored some function , he still was missing a nose and otherwise grossly disfigured .
Maki 's first order of business in his first public appearance following the operation was to thank the widow of Joseph Helfgot , the deceased donor of his new face .
Helfgot died last month after a heart transplant procedure .
" I want to say thank you to Susan and her husband Joseph for the gift they have given me .
I will be forever grateful , " Maki said .
" I also want to thank the doctors and nurses who have given me a new chance to live my life .
... I now see this chance as a way to start fresh . "
A month after the surgery , Maki 's face still has not healed completely .
Deep purple furrows run from the top of his newly replaced nose to the base of his reconstructed cheeks .
He still has some trouble speaking , and he has yet to gain feeling in much of the new face .
Still , he noted that he was pleased with the result of the surgery .
" My nose looks the same as my old nose , " he told reporters .
The press conference took place shortly after Maki had met Susan Whitman - Helfgot for the very first time .
" Joseph 's life ended too soon , but it is my great joy to meet Jim , " Whitman - Helfgot said .
" It is a miracle and a blessing . "
When Is Face Transplant the Proper Choice ?
But even now , as the world 's total number of face transplant recipients stands at six , it is clear that there are differences when it comes to determining whether a patient is a viable candidate for a new face , as opposed to a liver , heart or other organ .
The United Network of Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) has no hard - and - fast rules when it comes to the lifestyle behaviors of those on the organ transplant waiting list , noted UNOS spokeswoman Mandy Claggett .
However , the hospitals that put these patients on the waiting list often will create strict criteria on alcohol use , substance abuse or any factors that would suggest the patient would have difficulty adhering to the stringent regimen of anti-rejection drugs they would have to take for the rest of their lives .
" Most programs do exclude patients who are non-compliant or not adherent with medical therapy , and most exclude patients who continue to engage in the same behaviors that resulted in end - organ damage -- intravenous drug abuse , continued alcoholism , et cetera , " said Dr. David Cronin , director of liver transplantation at Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital in Milwaukee .
" On the issue of face transplantation , I suspect that many of the candidates incurred their ' end - organ failure ' from an accident or war - related injury . "
So while there are standard exclusion criteria for some forms of organ transplant -- for example , a patient in need of a liver may be denied a spot on the UNOS waiting list if he cannot abstain from alcohol for six months before surgery -- there are currently no such restrictions for face transplant candidates .
This makes is difficult to determine whether Maki , who has a past history of drug abuse , would normally fit the bill of an ideal organ recipient .
By the same token , the world 's first face transplant patient , Frenchwoman Isabelle Dinoire , in a much - publicized story , continued her smoking habit as her grafted tissue healed .
Face Transplants Only Option for Some Patients
Rather , facial transplant patients are largely selected by a process of elimination -- those patients for whom other surgeries have not worked .
" In my mind , facial transplants have to occur when traditional methods fail , " said lead surgeon Dr. Bohdan Pomahac of Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston at the Thursday press conference .
The extent of Maki 's injuries , Pomahac said , certainly fulfilled this criterion .
Pomahac was the burn surgeon on duty when Maki arrived in the Brigham and Women 's Hospital emergency department after the accident that destroyed his face .
" He burned off his face , including nose , upper lip , roof of the mouth , et cetera , " Pomahac said .
Indeed , Maki 's injuries were so profound that there are hints that Brigham and Women 's Hospital may have bent its previous rules on who could be considered a viable patient for the procedure .
As late as last year , Brigham and Women 's had publicly stated that it would not perform this kind of transplant because of ethics guidelines that it created when face transplants first became a viable option .
Citing the rigors and side effects of immunosuppressant therapy to prevent organ rejection , the hospital 's old rules , now changed , would only allow a patient to receive a face transplant procedure if he or she already was using these drugs after a procedure such as a heart or kidney transplant .
However , doctors and ethicists have subsequently agreed the move was likely justified .
" It is hard for us to imagine how difficult it was for Jim .
He feared going outside , " Pomahac said .
" I feel that we are here on a mission , using cutting - edge technology to restore patients ' lives . "
Future May Hold Stricter Face Transplant Guidelines
While finding a family who is willing to donate the face of their deceased loved on is still a challenging prerequisite for face transplant surgery , the number of patients involved in these surgeries is still small enough that large - scale selection criteria probably do not come into play .
Face Transplant Criteria Could Become More Stringent
While face transplant recipient candidates remain scarce , as of Thursday afternoon there were 102,137 Americans on the UNOS organ transplant waiting list .
The number of available organs is far fewer , and many patients die before an organ becomes available .
" Solid organs for transplantation are extraordinarily scarce resources , " said Rosamond Rhodes , director of Bioethics Education at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City .
" When one person is allocated an organ , someone else may die for lack of an organ .
Consequently , it is critical to allocate the short supply justly , " she said .
" Because face transplantation is so new , the just allocation issue is not yet critical . "
But while today 's face transplant recipients may face fewer selection criteria than those who need a liver , heart or kidney , Rhodes said this may not be the case in the future .
" As more face transplants are completed successfully , the demand for the treatment will increase and the available facial tissue will become a scarce resource , " she said .
" Then , principles of justice should be used to govern the allocation . "
Cronin agreed .
" I would predict that as facial transplantation becomes more popular , the selection criteria will evolve to insure the appropriate care and success of the composite tissue transplant , " he said .
" Although the face may not be a scarce or life - saving ' organ ' in the same sense that solid organs are , the expense and investment in the procedure will require a similar selection process with the possible requirement of additional increased psychological scrutiny . "
Meanwhile , Maki said that though he was aware the story has been the subject of much media attention , he wished to live quietly and privately .
" I now see this chance as a way to start fresh , " he said .
" I just appreciate that I have the chance to start a new life , because the first part of my life was nothing but trouble . "

" For those who appreciate the virtues of private enterprise , the UL insignia is an inspiration . "
Look at the back of your computer monitor , the bottom of your table lamp , or the label on your hair dryer .
Chances are you will see the symbol " UL " with a circle around it .
It stands for Underwriters Laboratories , a firm headquartered in Northbrook , Illinois , and an unsung hero of the market economy .
Most people do n't realize that dozens of products in their homes — toasters , fire extinguishers , space heaters , televisions , etc. — have been tested by the Underwriters Lab for safety .
The Lab also tests items like bulletproof vests , electric blankets , commercial ice - cream machines , and chicken de-beakers , among thousands of other products .
But the Lab is n't an arm of the government .
It is privately owned , financed , and operated .
No one is compelled by force of law to use its services .
It thrives — and makes our lives safer — by the power of its excellent reputation .
For that reason , its ideologically driven enemies on the Left despise it .
The firm was formed in 1894 to deal with the dangers posed by the dramatic increase in the use of electricity .
Today , it employs 4,000 scientists , engineers , and safety specialists to render an independent verdict on hundreds of thousands of products .
The very existence of the Lab debunks the common civics - text view that , without government intervention , private businesses would seek profit without regard for safety ; thus , bureaucrats have to police markets to impose a balance between private interests and the common good .
The government , according to this view , is the only thing standing between us and unceasing fatal accidents .
The truth is the opposite .
The market is well equipped to regulate itself , and does a fine job of it .
It 's the government that operates without oversight .
To discover the quality and value of products , no one would trust the advice of the scandal - ridden Commerce Department or the Federal Trade Commission .
" It 's the government that operates without oversight . "
Unlike quality and price , safety is n't always at the forefront of the consumer 's mind .
But that has n't kept manufacturers from seeking out the Lab 's testing services .
For those who appreciate the virtues of private enterprise , the UL insignia is an inspiration .
The Lab was the first to set standards for certifying the safety of pilots and planes before the government intervened .
It set the standards for building materials , fire - fighting equipment , air conditioners , and household chemicals .
It employs safecrackers and pyrotechnicians to test safes , and a variety of unique machines and devices to test thousands of other products each year .
It has been testing multicolored Christmas lights since 1905 , and entered the building - code business right after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 .
Despite its unparalleled experience and success , the market economy keeps the Lab innovating .
As engineer John Drengenberg of the Lab said ,
There 's always some little twist in a new product — an innovative feature or something to make it cheaper — to keep us busy developing the appropriate test procedure .
Its effectiveness in determining safety standards ( even for brand - new products ) and maintaining them over time has generated an interesting result .
Many government regulations , especially at the state level , merely mimic the building codes and insurance requirements of the Lab .
The Lab also " regulates " in a cost - effective way .
Companies come to the Lab to present their products and the tests they have already conducted .
The company pays a testing fee ranging from a couple of hundred dollars to several thousand , depending on the costs of the tests to be conducted .
If the product passes , it receives one of three designations :
To be " listed " means that the product has passed muster for sale as a final product , like a hair dryer .
If it is listed as " recognized , " it is safe to use as a component within the final product , like a transformer .
To be " certified " means that the product has met someone else 's standards , such as the Chicago building code .
Each product is tested for each use , and the Lab is strict about how its mark is used by manufacturers .
For example , Securitron Magnalock sent a new lock to the Lab for testing .
New standards had to be established , and the lock was duly tested and " recognized " as a component for a delayed - exit system .
When the company faxed all of its field representatives that the product was " UL approved , " Lab officials suspended the listing .
It then required Securitron to inform all employees that UL does not " approve " any product .
To insure continued safety , manufacturers agree to let the Lab inspect their production facilities and to retest on demand .
These on - site inspections , often four a year , are unannounced .
Lab inspectors can require manufacturers to present data and to rerun safety trials and experiments .
Companies , in turn , pay a tiny fee for every UL designation symbol they put on their products .
Manufacturers can modify their products to adapt to market conditions , but the Lab oversees changes that affect product safety .
The Lab is inflexible and scientific , but it's also driven by common sense and realism .
Nothing is perfectly safe , of course .
The competitive marketplace and the Lab aim for safety in a framework of rational attention to costs .
UL official Drengenberg has noted , " It would be very easy for us to come up with an overly strict standard , " but then no one could afford to buy the product .
In fact , the Lab once built a fireproof office for some of its employees .
The expensive room featured ceramic tile on the walls and ceiling , a thick concrete floor , metal furniture , and similar standards .
Not only was the cost high , the esthetic results were not impressive .
As Robert Yereance , author of Electrical Fire Analysis says , " most of us cannot afford a fireproof dwelling and would not like living in it if we could . "
" Many government regulations merely mimic the building codes and insurance requirements of the Underwriters Lab . "
The Lab notes that 80 % of accidents and fires are caused by consumers , not products .
It takes this into account in its requirements .
In the case of space heaters , for example , the Lab felt that enhanced warning labels would reduce as many fires as an expensive redesign , thus keeping down cost and price .
Compare this approach with the government's .
Its standards are as difficult to understand as they are contradictory .
But its uncertain standards contrast with its hard - edged enforcement and oversight .
With the government , products that meet the standards do n't have to be safe , while perfectly safe products can fail to pass the regulations .
The Lab is not perfect , and , in a few cases , it has paid damages for its mistakes .
But the failures have been few and far between .
Just last year , it tested more than 16,500 types of products , nearly 80,000 different products , conducted ongoing on - site inspections , and placed the UL symbol on nearly nine billion products .
The Lab has its critics , of course .
For example , Stuart Statler of the Trial Lawyers of America calls the Lab " totally driven by industry money . "
Whereas they should be driven by trial - lawyer money ?
" Consumer advocate " Ralph Nader claims that the Lab is a " very meek , ' lowest common denominator type ' operation . "
In short , it does n't impose unreasonable burdens on the market , bankrupt companies , or harm consumers .
Most recently , the New York Times accused the Lab of letting down its guard and conspiring with manufacturers .
The controversy surrounds the Lab 's listing of a new $ 2 twister cap that connects copper and aluminum wires .
When copper was relatively expensive , houses were wired with aluminum .
After long use , however , it has proven more of a fire hazard .
Full rewiring is expensive , so the innovative caps allow homeowners an intermediate solution .
But for bureaucrats and left - wing ideologues , no private solution is praiseworthy .
The Times ' Barry Meier writes that the Lab is " sparring with Federal officials in a behind - the - scenes battle " that is " exposing some potential shortcomings of industry self - regulation . "
The hope of those who oppose the twister cap is that the government will refuse to approve it for use .
People will have to use old aluminum wires or the old , unsafe cap .
In either case , the fire hazard will remain higher .
Such are the consequences of siding with government over private standards .
After a century of public service , Underwriters Laboratories has proven a safe , effective , and cost - conscious alternative to government bureaucracy .
It shows us that the market discovers new and effective solutions to the problems of everyday life , reduces the risks all around us , and does so without resorting to the coercion and inefficiency of government .
( CNN ) -- Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch expects News Corporation - owned newspaper
Web sites to start charging users for access within a year in a move which analysts say could radically shake - up the culture of freely available content .
Murdoch said the existing Internet business model was " malfunctioning . "
Speaking on a conference call as News Corporation announced a 47 percent slide in quarterly profits to $ 755 million , Murdoch said the current free access business model favored by most content providers was flawed .
" We are now in the midst of an epochal debate over the value of content and it is clear to many newspapers that the current model is malfunctioning , " the News Corp. Chairman and CEO said .
" We have been at the forefront of that debate and you can confidently presume that we are leading the way in finding a model that maximizes revenues in return for our shareholders ...
The current days of the Internet will soon be over . "
Murdoch said the experience of the News Corp. - owned Wall Street Journal had proved that charging for content could be made to work .
Would you pay to use news Web sites ?
Sound Off below
He said 360,000 people had downloaded an iPhone WSJ application in three weeks .
Users would soon be made to pay " handsomely " for accessing WSJ content , he added .
Murdoch said he envisaged other News Corp. titles introducing charges within 12 months .
Murdoch 's international newspaper empire includes the New York Post , the News International stable of UK titles including the Sun and the Times , and a cluster of Australian papers including the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun .
His comments come with the U.S. newspaper industry in a state of crisis amid plunging advertising revenues and falling circulations with several historic titles already going out of business .
Joshua Benton , Director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University , said Murdoch was not the only executive looking to generate new income streams from online content .
" News executives are starting to recognize that online advertising revenues are not enough on their own , " Benton told CNN .
But he said the challenge for media organizations was finding a balance between advertising and subscription revenues and figuring out how to charge for content without alienating existing users -- which could lead to Web sites offering tiered levels of free and paid - for material .
" I suspect within any readership there is a small slice -- maybe three percent -- that is willing to pay .
News organizations are going to have to find a way of getting money from that slice without driving away everybody else , " Benton said .
" I do n't think you can afford to put a lock and chain on the front page .
Benton said the U.S. newspaper industry was in a " horrible state " which was likely to get worse .
" We 're starting to see holes where newspapers were .
The question is , will new Web sites fill the holes , will traditional names come in -- or will they just not get filled ? "
Earlier this week , the 137 - year - old Boston Globe said it would be forced to shut down unless it reached an agreement with unions over a $ 10 million program of cost - cutting measures .
Watch media chief discuss charging for online content »
The paper 's owners , The New York Times Co. , postponed plans to close the paper after reaching a deal with six of seven employees ' unions but said the Globe was expected to lose $ 85 million in 2009 if it did not make major cuts .
The developments followed the demise of print editions of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver , Colorado ; The Seattle Post - Intelligencer ; and The Christian Science Monitor .
The Rocky Mountain News shut down completely ; both the Seattle paper and the Christian Science Monitor remain in online editions .
At least 120 newspapers in the U.S. have shut down since January 2008 , according to Paper Cuts , a Web site tracking the newspaper industry .
More than 21,000 jobs at 67 newspapers have vaporized in that time , according to the site .
Despite the general mood of gloom over the state of the economy , Murdoch said he believed the worst of the financial crisis had passed .
" I 'm not an economist and we all know economists were created to make weather forecasters look good , " he said .
" But it is increasingly clear the worst is over . "

President Obama basically said that we ca n’t demonize every investor who earns a profit , because “ we are all in this together . ”
Sorry , but I am going to have to call a big fat “ bull - shit ” on this one .
When Obama said “ we ” did he have a mouse in his pocket ?
Obama , and his family have a very opulent , slave - built roof over their heads .
He travels on the public nickel , his children attend an exclusive Washington , DC private school that has organic food on its menu , and has health care that covers everyone in his family from head to toe and side to side and inside out .
Even though he and every member of the administration , Congress and the Supreme Court are not hurting for anything , the bastard ( sorry if your parents were n’t married when you were conceived )
Wall Street banksters are receiving billions of dollars of government welfare and are not so good about being in “ this together ” with us .
The only concrete steps the Treasury and Fed have taken are to buy “ toxic ” assets ( if something is toxic can it still be an asset ? ) so companies like Goldman Sachs ( via AIG ) can have the public tit rescue them from their stupider than crap mistakes .
WE the ROBBED Class are in this together .
THEY the ROBBER Class are in it for themselves .
How many times does Obama have to demonstrate that his economic recovery is nothing but Reaganomics wrapped in a little bit of populist rhetoric to make it easier for the mis-informed Robbed Class to swallow .
If anything transpires to alleviate the suffering in our Class at all , it will be because some of the prosperity got through the cracks in the deeply cancerous system and trickled ON us .
Rest assured , this is just a mistake and the only time the Robber Class cares about us , is when the interests of the two classes collide .
I will feel like I am “ in this ” with the Obamas when I have a free house , free health care and if my children would not have to go into lifelong debt to pay for university .
I wonder if the wall to wall homeless population ( it ’s growing at an alarming rate ) here in San Francisco feels “ in this together ” with the Wall Street Robbers ?
I wonder if the people standing waiting for hours in municipal Emergency Rooms waiting to get some , any medical attention feel “ in this together ” with Congress which has 110 % medical coverage ?
I wonder if the foot soldiers for the Empire feel “ in this together ” with the War Profiteer Robbers ?
I wonder if the victims of the drug wars and street wars feel “ in this together ” with the children of the Robbers who ride to their schools in limos with bodyguards ?
I wonder if our brothers and sisters living in tent cities with their children feel “ in this together ” with the Pelosis and Feinsteins of the world who live in their obscenely huge mansions in exclusive neighborhoods and fly back and forth from DC in private jets that suck down gas at an immoral rate ?
I wonder if our brothers and sisters who just cashed a final unemployment check feels “ in this together ” with the Robbers who just cashed millions in bonuses ?
I , myself , feel “ in this together ” with the homeless , hungry , sick , jobless , struggling , stressed , frightened , confused , yet resilient , brave and strong .
WE are in this together .
WE need to step outside of the Robber Class system and start to build our own systems to help each other through this Robber Class / Goldman Sachs / Federal Reserve depression .

MORTON ASH rarely needs a reason to take his 1975 Datsun 280 Z out for a drive , but a recent sunny afternoon provided an extra inducement .
“ I like to use it at least once a week , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t let a car like this just sit . ”
Mr. Ash , a vice president for sales at Gould Paper , was standing inside the parking garage in Chelsea where he has kept the two - door sports car since he bought it new for around $ 6,300 .
After three decades of his careful stewardship , the silver 280Z has covered nearly 330,000 miles .
Mr. Ash bent his tall frame into the driver seat and started the car .
“ Seat belts are a good idea , ” he said dryly , and both driver and passenger complied .
Mr. Ash then settled into the bucket seat and nosed the car forward , craning his neck to look down 10th Avenue .
The afternoon ’s destination was the Taconic Parkway , or close to it , via the West Side Highway along the Hudson River , to the Saw Mill River Parkway .
Mr. Ash grew up in Rockland County and moved to Manhattan 45 years ago , and he still considers himself a country boy .
If a blue jay sees a normal - looking salamander , it will eat it .
But if the same bird sees a freak , it may let it go .
University of Tennessee researcher Benjamin Fitzpatrick says this discovery , which his team reports in the open access journal BMC Ecology , suggests why rare traits persist in a population .
Predators detect common forms of prey more easily , the scientists figure .
The majority that share a common look are always on the dinner menu , while oddballs are left to reproduce .
" Maintenance of variation is a classic paradox in evolution because both selection and drift tend to remove variation from populations , " Fitzpatrick explained today .
" If one form has an advantage , such as being harder to spot , it should replace all others .
Likewise , random drift [ genetic change that occurs by chance ] alone will eventually result in loss of all but one form when there are no fitness differences .
There must therefore be some advantage that allows unusual traits to persist . "
The researchers placed a selection of food - bearing model salamanders into a field for six days , with striped models outnumbering the unstriped by nine to one , or vice versa .
On test days , the numbers were evened out .
In each case , Blue Jays were more likely to attack the models that had been most prevalent over the previous six - day period .
" We believe that the different color forms represent different ways of blending in on the forest floor , " Fitzpatrick said .
" Looking for something cryptic takes both concentration and practice .
Predators concentrating on finding striped salamanders might not notice unstriped ones . "
High - end buses to make bid for Lexus commuters Startup service to connect S.F. , Marin , San Jose in Wi-Fi luxury

Call it a corporate shuttle bus , without the corporation .
On Tuesday , a San Francisco company that runs luxury shuttles for the likes of Google and Yahoo will start a new , weekday bus service connecting Marin County , San Francisco and San Jose .
The buses will be the same kind of tricked - out rides that Bauer 's Intelligent Transportation uses for its corporate clients , with padded leather seats , television screens , free Wi-Fi and power plugs for laptops .
But they will be open to anyone who wants to pay the fare - $ 8.20 one way on most routes .
" We 're trying to get people out of their Mercedes or Lexus , people who would n't ride public transit , " said company Chief Executive Officer Gary Bauer .
Each route will have just a handful of stops .
To deal with the spread - out urban geography of the South Bay , the stops are located near prominent companies or transit hubs .
The Sunnyvale stop , for example , is at North Mathilda and Fifth avenues , near Juniper Networks , Lockheed Martin and a light rail station for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority .
The buses will have coffee and breakfast available for purchase , served by a " ride host " much like an airline flight attendant .
A passenger can leave San Francisco 's Ferry Building at 5:30 a.m. , eat , watch the morning news , work on the laptop and arrive in Sunnyvale at 6:45 a.m .
" We want to encompass all that and make it one seamless transaction for you , " Bauer said .
" We 're looking to give you back 10 hours of your life " each week .
The new bus service , called Wi-Drive , also will give San Francisco companies another way to comply with the city 's new commuter benefits ordinance .
The law , which took effect in January , requires businesses with 20 or more workers to reimburse employees for transit fares , offer them free shuttle service on company - funded vehicles or set up a payroll deduction that lets them use pretax wages to purchase transit passes .
" It 's a chic way of taking advantage of the ordinance , " said San Francisco Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi .
He was n't thinking of high - end buses when he wrote the ordinance , but he said he 's pleased to see businesses coming up with new ways to respond .
Creative solution
" I expected that new , emerging modalities would become part of the landscape , " Mirkarimi said .
" I welcome the creativity . "
Rod Diridon , head of the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University , said the bus lines were an interesting idea .
But he questioned whether commuters willing to let someone else drive would choose the buses over Caltrain , which runs a similar route , costs less and skips the Peninsula 's crowded freeways .
" With auto congestion increasing all the time , I 'm not sure how they 're going to compete , " he said .
Bauer is banking on the buses ' amenities and atmosphere .
The kind of customer his company is targeting , he says , is n't interested in the utilitarian buses and trains of existing mass - transit systems .
In addition , Wi-Drive goes places that Caltrain and BART do n't , such as Larkspur .
Right now , those people are driving to work , Bauer said , with their cars adding a little bit every day to global warming .
If he can fill each 52 - seat bus with former car commuters , each bus will prevent 1,310 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere every year , he said .
" We 're not here to take people away from public transit , " Bauer said .
" We 're not trying to step on anyone 's toes .
We want to complement what they do . "
Payment particulars
Wi -Drive customers who buy a fare receive a plastic card with a magnetic stripe on the back and a Web site address on the front .
On the Web site , they can set up an account and prepay fares from their credit cards , as well as reserve seats .
Buying a month 's worth of rides lowers the price , to $ 7.38 one way on most routes .
The next time customers board the bus , they swipe their Wi-Drive card at the door , deducting the fare from their account .
To launch the service , rides will be free from March 3 to March 6 .
The following week , Bauer 's will offer half - price fares .
Then on March 16 , fares rise to their regular level .
If the service proves a success , Bauer 's will expand it to such locations as Stockton , Fairfield , Napa and Santa Cruz .

Quacking Like a Duck
One of the oft heard complaints about modern medicine is that it 's dominated by " big pharma , " that is greedy , soulless corporations who lie to us and suppress less expensive and more effective treatments for monetary gain .
While it 's true that corporations are out for monetary gain , and there have been irregularities as with any big business , let 's take a look at the pot that 's calling the kettle greedy here .
Consider a single product : Oscillococcinum .
Their site never actually says that the " FDA regulated drug " does anything ... really , read carefully .
It does n't .
They do claim it is a " Flu Medicine . "
And they claim studies have shown its effectiveness in reducing flu symptoms .
We 'll save examining the studies for another time , for the purpose of this article , let 's focus on the ingredients .
Pharmaceuticals such as Tamiflu and Zithromax are tested for years before they 're released to the public .
Teams of chemists , lawyers , doctors , nurses , clinical researches , and study subjects go over every conceivable side effect or quality control issue before the drug is released to the market .
These procedures cost an incredibly large amount of money , and while it may , in fact , be ridiculous to charge $ 5 for a pill , there is at least some basis for them being expensive .
Part of that basis , is that they have active ingredients .
Not so for Oscilloccinum .
Each capsule is 1 gram , and it contains a 200X preparation of muscovy duck heart and liver , .15 g of lactose ( milk sugar ) , and .85g of sucrose ( table sugar ) .
For those unwilling to do math , the sugars add up to 1.00 g .
Er.. where 's the duck liver ?
Well , a 200x preparation of anything is past Avogadro 's limit .
It 's chemically impossible for there to be even one molecule of duck liver in an Oscilloccinum capsule .
That means ... there is exactly no duck liver in it .
In fact , it 's a capsule of sugar , more suited for sweetening tea than reducing your flu symptoms .
The tea might help though .
What does the company have to say about this ?
Gina Casey , manufacturer Boiron 's spokesman says " Of course it 's safe : there 's nothing in it . "
So how much is this product that 's basically less than 1¢ worth of sugar ?
$ 21.59 will buy you 6 dosages , which are to be taken up to three times a day .
At $ 3.60 a capsule , that 's a pretty tidy profit , would n't you say ?
Oh , I failed to mention ... it 's available in over 50 countries .
I was in a " health " food store today , and their very prominent displays of Oscillococcinum were nearly depleted .
Why ?
Fear of H1N1 or " Swine Flu . "
Not even Boiron says the stuff will do anything to prevent the flu , but people are buying it in droves .
Greed did someone say ?
I 'd say selling something with no active ingredients is the very definition of greed .
In fact , there 's another word for it : snake oil .
Maybe we can find some tar to go with all those duck feathers their factories must produce .
Oh wait , never mind .
A single duck would have provided far more than enough liver and heart for every single capsule ever made .
And it would still be quacking to boot , just like the people who promote this stuff .
Four banks and one credit institution failed on Friday .
This is now becoming a common Friday ritual .
On February 13 four banks were also taken over by the FDIC .
Multiple bank failures on one day are now growing in size .
Yet the FDIC is quickly blazing through their insurance fund and soon , the taxpayer is going to be paying the bill .
The American taxpayer is already bailing out many of the larger financial institutions .
These are the 19 banks included in the smoke and mirrors government stress test .
What a surprise that all banks looked fine especially since the U.S.
Treasury allowed banks to self report on many items .
150 people were involved in examining trillions and trillions of dollars in assets .
It was the ultimate bread and circus event for the masses .
American households are quickly realizing that all the trillions committed to bailouts are essentially going to prop up the banking oligarchy that appears to be running the country .
This is reflected in polling although the mainstream media hardly talks about this because they are hungry for advertising revenues which come from these sectors :
Source : Gallup
You would think that with only 18 percent of Americans having some confidence in their banking system that the media would be shedding a more critical eye on the banks .
That is not case .
And as I will show with the following four graphs , nearly 2 years into this financial crisis , the vast majority of Americans have not seen any noticeable help .
A country with 24 million unemployed and underemployed citizens and we are asked to bailout the perpetrators of one of histories greatest debt bubbles .
Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product is the aggregate figure of a nation ’s economic vitality .
Gross domestic product can be broken down as follows :
GDP = consumption + gross investment + government spending + ( exports – imports )
A large part of our GDP comes from consumption ( over two - thirds ) .
If you stop and think about this , a country that spends more than it earns is bound to get into economic trouble eventually .
And this balance completely shifted in the last 30 years .
This credit bubble started 30 years ago and you will see that in a subsequent graph .
The fairytale that was pushed onto the American public was that it was okay to consume more than it produced .
In fact , not only was this okay but it was okay to consume and do this with debt .
It is fascinating that we call this mess the credit bubble when in reality , it is a debt bubble .
How often have you heard politicians , Wall Street , or the mainstream media call this the debt bubble ?
George Orwell would be proud .
Now the chart above is important .
As you can see , on a year over year basis GDP is contracting at the fastest pace since the early 1960s .
Most bailout recipients are betting ( hoping ) there will be a second half recovery because there is a growing populist anger against the banks and Wall Street and rightfully so .
And going back to our initial equation , consumption has been decreasing while government spending is attempting to make up for that fall in the equation .
We are also exporting less and definitely importing less as measured by traffic at our busiest ports .
Household Debt and Excess Reserves
The above chart is rather telling .
As you can see for yourself , household debt has been increasing by leaps and bounds for the past 30 years .
It has gotten to the point where households have as much debt as our nation ’s annual GDP .
We have been spending our way to prosperity ( or at least the illusion of it ) .
I ’ve also included in the chart part of the nice little gift we are handing out to banks .
If you recall , the entire purpose of the bailout was to help American families have access to credit .
That was the argument at least .
The chart above shows since the 1970s ( and even before that ) banks never carried any size of excess reserves .
Why ?
They have been lending money out like maniacs for 40 years .
All this money was handed out to consumers to spend and spend on things increasingly made abroad .
We were told that manufacturing and making “ things ” was a waste of time and should be relegated to “ third - world ” countries .
But recently , even banks do n’t believe this .
The jump in excess reserves , money that was supposed to trickle down to American consumers is being hoarded to deal with problems on bank balance sheets .
Ask yourself this , if banks were so healthy like the stress test told us , then why are they holding onto $ 700 billion in excess reserves ?
The answer of course is that they are not healthy and are looking out for themselves .
The entire premise of bailing out the banks was false .
The reason we bailed out the banks was to protect Wall Street and the banks .
Period .
It had nothing to do with protecting the American consumer who is already maxed out in debt as you can see from the chart above .
Industrial Production
As the largest economy in the world , we still do produce a lot although as you can see from the above charts we have been consuming more and more .
Industrial production is contracting at the fastest pace since the 1970s .
The trouble with this is that in the 1970s , there was a legitimate reason for the decline in industrial production .
That reason was we were shipping manufacturing jobs overseas :
So much of that fall in the 1970s had to do with this .
But now , the contraction is largely due to the economic consequences of spending too much all fueled by debt .
While Americans are now having to do more with less , banks ( the select 19 at least ) are having an unlimited line of credit to the U.S. government .
Over the past few months , 20,000 Americans are losing their jobs per day .
Many are realizing they have no safety net yet watch their tax dollars go to pay executive compensation and bailout banking giants who profited by creating the biggest debt bubble ever known .
Inflation and Deflation
The menace of deflation is making the rounds .
Cheaper homes .
Automobiles that now cost thousands of dollars less because of falling demand .
Cheaper fuel .
Stagnant wages .
All these are signs of deflation .
As the chart above will show , this is the first time we have seen a year over year drop in the CPI since the mid-1950s .
We keep hearing that eventually , we will see inflation because of all the bailouts .
That would only be true if banks were n’t hoarding the money to prop each other up .
The money would have to make it into the hands of consumers to cause any inflation .
Yet that is not happening .
Also , since the crisis started nearly $ 50 trillion in global wealth has evaporated .
So even though we are committing approximately $ 13 trillion to bailout our economy ( largely Wall Street and banks ) there has been more money destruction than money creation .
So that is why we have yet to see any signs of inflation .
The disturbing path we are following is largely what Japan did in bailing out their banking system .
They now have some of the largest government debt burdens in relation to their GDP because of these bailouts .
And what was the result nearly 20 years later ?
A stagnant economy with their stock markets still at lows and their real estate market still near the bottom .
Yet some people made out like bandits .
These were those tied to the largest banks .
Is this sounding familiar ?
The bottom line is once Americans realize in mass that they are largely bailing out banks to save banks , not the country , they will start asking more important questions .
And the above polls reflect this change .
Yet watching the mainstream media you would not know this .
Hearing politicians talk you would think that we are all for committing trillions to save Wall Street .
The vast majority of Americans do not support these actions .
Just read what was released by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo regarding Bank of America ’s shotgun marriage to Merrill Lynch ( the entire letter is worth a read ) :
“ Despite the fact that Bank of America had determined that Merrill Lynch ’s financial condition was so grave that it justified termination of the deal pursuant to the MAC clause , Bank of America did not publicly disclose Merrill Lynch ’s devastating losses or the impact it would have on the merger .
Nor did Bank of America disclose that it had been prepared to invoke the MAC clause and would have done so but for the intervention of the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
Lewis testified that the question of disclosure was not up to him and that his decision not to disclose was based on direction from Paulson and Bernanke : “ I was instructed that ‘ We do not want a public disclosure . ”
Basically Ken Lewis , CEO of Bank of America did not have the guts to do what was right and the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve basically sacrificed the American taxpayer to save another crony bank .
Ken Lewis wanted to back out because Merrill Lynch had horrific losses which made the deal a bad one .
Yet the U.S. Treasury through Paulson realized that the only way they were going to get political power to save Merrill Lynch was if they linked it up to a large institution most Americans are familiar with .
Bank of America .
Lewis greedy and hungry naively jumped into the deal to own a Wall Street broker powerhouse and got screwed .
Once he found out the fact that the firm had lied ( shocker ) about losses it was too late .
Once BofA had Merrill , Paulson basically told Lewis if he backed out he would be replaced .
You keep hearing systemic risk non-sense but Lehman Brothers failed and we managed .
Yet how could they allow one of their own to fail ?
This folks is how Americans are bailing out banks and Wall Street while each day 20,000 additional Americans become unemployed .

NO COUNTRY in Asia or the Pacific is more clearly a beneficiary of China 's industrial revolution than is Australia .
Its coal fuels the power stations that keep that revolution churning .
Its iron is in the steel for every other new building .
Chinese demand for Australia 's mineral riches drove the long boom that ended last year .
It still provides Australia 's best hope of avoiding the worst of the slump that has followed .
Last November , when China announced its first big , 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) economic stimulus in response to the downturn , Kevin Rudd , Australia 's prime minister , was among the foreigners cheering loudest , calling it “ very good news ” .
The sense of relief was understandable .
Taking goods and services together , China is now Australia 's biggest trading partner .
The slump may slow this trend down , but not change its direction .
Yet on a recent visit to Canberra , a capital whose eerily empty streets and subterranean parliament suggest a Pyongyang without the dystopia , Banyan found politicians and policy pundits in a quandary over how to handle both China and the recent upwelling of popular Australian antipathy towards the Chinese government .
For all that China is Australia 's second - biggest export market , with huge potential for growth , it is also a dictatorial power whose policies anger many Australians .
Moreover , its commercial expansionism is accompanied by growing military strength .
Defence strategists , who are paid to think the worst , now see the biggest potential threat to Australian security not as an unstoppable influx of Indonesian boat people , but as China .
One by - product of the slump , a rash of Chinese companies snapping up stakes in Australian mining enterprises in response to tumbling share and commodity prices , has provoked a popular backlash .
To the mining companies , the colour of China 's money is dazzling .
But , though the Chinese onslaught looks fractious and pell - mell , conspiracy theorists smell a state - driven attack on the commanding heights of Australia 's economy .
They have succeeded in whipping up an anti-China mood .
In March Australia blocked China Minmetals ' acquisition of OZ Minerals , a copper and gold producer , on security grounds .
A ruling over an even bigger deal is pending , having been delayed until mid-June .
This will cover the $ 19.5 billion bid by Chinalco , an aluminium company , for nearly 20 % of cash - strapped Rio Tinto .
The government 's decision , on whether national security is at stake in this transaction , may be the hardest it has had to make since coming to power in late 2007 .
It seems certain that the prime minister wants the purchase to go through .
If it does , it will lead to renewed charges in Australia and around the region that he is soft on China as it seeks to extend its tentacles .
After all , Mr Rudd was once posted to Beijing for the foreign service .
In 2007 Chinese diplomats at a reception nearly choked on their canapés when Mr Rudd , then leader of the opposition , made a speech in faultless Mandarin .
The prime minister , John Howard of the ( conservative ) Liberal Party , looked on with ill - disguised fury .
Then , in a speech at Peking University last year , Mr Rudd described Australia as China 's zhengyou , its “ true friend ” .
Mr Howard had nailed his colours to the mast of Australia 's alliance with the United States , and after September 11th relished being America's “ deputy sheriff ” in the Asia - Pacific region .
Mr Rudd , by contrast , has urged world leaders to accept a greater role for China .
The opposition sneers at him as China 's “ roving ambassador ” .
There is enough force in this accusation to unsettle Mr Rudd .
In Britain for the G20 summit in early April , he was caught on camera squirming in embarrassment at being seated next to Fu Ying , China 's sophisticated ambassador to Britain ( and , before that , Australia ) .
Yet the slur is misplaced all the same .
Mr Rudd has few illusions about China .
He once wrote a thesis on Wei Jingsheng , one of China 's most persecuted dissidents .
Briefly out of a political job a decade ago , he trudged around China alone trying in vain to collect unpaid debts for Western firms .
Last year he watched the Chinese embassy in Canberra orchestrate squads of Chinese students in Australia to smother pro-Tibet demonstrations .
It was , says one of Mr Rudd 's friends , a crucial moment : the first time a foreign power had denied freedom of expression to Australians in their own homeland .
When Mr Rudd spoke of zhengyou last year , he used it in the dictionary definition of the term , as a “ friend who will give forthright admonition ” , as over China 's handling of Tibet .
China prefers lao pengyou , “ old friends ” , preferably sycophantic ones .
A stake in Australia 's heart
Indeed Mr Rudd appears to have a keener sense than Mr Howard of a growing strategic dilemma .
On the one hand , Australia 's crackerjack fit with the Chinese economy is reshaping Australia 's trade and investment flows , drawing the country into a China - centred Asian orbit .
On the other , Australia 's security hangs on America 's continued presence in the western Pacific .
A long - awaited defence white paper that is soon to appear is expected to recommend heavily strengthened armed forces .
A central question is what Australia should do as the primacy of the American sheriff fades and China 's power grows .
Worst of all for Australia would be if one day it had to choose between the United States and China — possibly over Taiwan .
The urge to avoid having to make such a choice partly explains Mr Rudd 's idea of an Asia - Pacific community , a framework for regional co-operation that he mentioned last year .
Misread as a vague expression of pan-Asian sentiment , this is in essence a possible plan of action .
For a start , offer China a say in helping to build predictable economic and security norms for the region .
As a Rudd adviser puts it of the Rio Tinto decision : what is the point of asking China to be a responsible stakeholder if it is n't offered a stake ?
But , if the attempt to tame China goes horribly awry , make sure America is still around to help sort out the mess .
Who were the best and worst U.S. presidents ?
In the past when historians and scholars have rated the presidents , their evaluations often have been based on individual charisma , activism , and service during periods of crisis .
Taking a distinctly new approach in Recarving Rushmore , Dr. Ivan Eland profiles each U.S. president on the merits of his policies and whether those strategies contributed to peace , prosperity , and liberty .
This ranking system is based on how effective each president was in fulfilling his oath to uphold the Constitution .
Contrary to the preferences of modern conservatives and liberals , this oath was intended to limit the role of the federal government .
Readers will be intrigued to discover why , of the four men given exalted representations on Mount Rushmore , only Washington deserves the honor .
They will learn why Teddy Roosevelt has been overrated ; why Jefferson hypocritically violated his lofty rhetoric of liberty ; and why Lincoln provoked a civil war that achieved far less than believed .
Readers will uncover why some presidents are rated much higher than the conventional wisdom for example , Warren Harding and some rank much lower for example , Harry Truman .
As for more modern U.S. chief executives , Republicans will be astounded to learn that Nixon was the last liberal president and that Reagan wasnt all that conservative .
Democrats will be amazed to learn that Clinton was in some respects more conservative than George W. Bush .
Readers will learn why the author goes against the grain and anoints Eisenhower and Carter as the two best modern presidents .
Eland courageously puts forth these provocative findings in this unique and insightful assessment of those who have held the office of President of the United States .

Detailed Summary
Highlights
U.S. presidents who are regarded highly by historians , journalists , law professors , and the public often fare poorly when we consider the ill effects of their policies or their unfaithfulness to the Constitution .
A new ranking of the presidents one that focuses on how effectively they advanced peace , prosperity , and liberty within the limits of their constitutional powers virtually turns upside down those rankings that praise a president because he was a charismatic leader , a good manager , or served during a time of national crisis .
Figuratively speaking , Ivan Elands Peace , Prosperity and Liberty ( PP&L ) rankings show that recarving Mount Rushmore is long overdue .
Abraham Lincoln , often ranked as one of the three greatest presidents in U.S. history , helped to provoke a bloody civil war and then pursued it ineptly and brutally .
The war nominally ended slavery , but for many decades African Americans experienced only marginally more freedom from bitter white southerners than before their emancipation .
Peaceful alternatives to Lincolns policies might have achieved better results more quickly .
Far from the being the number one president , Lincoln earns a low PP&L ranking of 29 , placing him in the category of bad presidents .
Thomas Jefferson , although a proponent of small government , imposed a trade embargo that curtailed the liberty he championed rhetorically and led to starvation in America .
His unconstitutional Louisiana Purchase and his forced relocation of Native Americans to less desirable land farther west set bad precedents for acquiring new territory .
Jeffersons PP&L ranking is only 26 , placing him near the top of the bad presidents category .
The charismatic Teddy Roosevelt was a less consequential president than his dull predecessor , William McKinley , was excessively belligerent in foreign policy , and was a champion of progressive polices that actually harmed the people he was trying to help .
Teddy Roosevelts PP&L ranking of 21 puts him squarely in the poor category .
George Washington expanded the role of the federal government and the powers of the presidency beyond what most of the Constitutions framers envisioned .
He also set other bad precedents , including unconstitutionally crushing the Whiskey Rebellion .
Washington earns a high PP&L ranking of 7 , placing him solidly in the category of good presidents , because , despite his shortcomings , he had republican intentions , shunned becoming a king or dictator , and left office after two terms .
Synopsis
Who were the best and worst U.S. presidents , and what criteria should be used to make a meaningful comparison ?
Presidents are often judged by their personal charisma , intellect , oratory skills or management style  but are these traits the most important ones for a president to possess ?
Couldnt a very intelligent , well - spoken , charming taskmaster , who served during a time of national crisis , also be a lousy president if his policies undermined freedom , hampered economic progress , and made the country less safe ?
Conversely , couldnt a boring president with average intellect and unexceptional skills excel in the Oval Office if he also possessed other qualities in abundance , such as a firm commitment to the principles behind the Constitution ?
Recarving Rushmore takes a distinctly new approach to evaluating the presidents .
While academics and pundits have often paid natural respect to war heroes  and to those who have expanded presidential power , Ivan Eland ( Senior Fellow , The Independent Institute ) cuts through bias and political rhetoric to deliver the first no -nonsense presidential ranking system based purely on what they did .
Profiling every president from George Washington to George W. Bush , Eland analyzes each mans policy decisions and ranks them based on the core principles of peace , prosperity , liberty , and adherence to the Constitutions limitations on presidential powers .
 Throughout this book , readers will find constant reminders that the executive branch has vastly increased its powermore than what the nations Founders and the Constitution ever envisioned ,  writes Eland in the books introduction .
 Also , this book criticizes an activist government at home and abroad , which both liberals and conservatives have perpetrated . 
Biases in Evaluating Presidents  Performance
Academics and pundits on the political right accuse their counterparts on the left of a tendency to rank the presidents according to their own agendas and vice versa .
The prejudices that analysts bring to a ranking of the presidents , however , are more complex than that , Eland explains .
Presidents are often judged by their personal charisma , intellect , oratory skill , or management style .
Their chances of being deemed a great president improve significantly if they served during a war or other crisis ; bland men in boring times usually get little respect .
Moreover , analysts often overemphasize the importance of presidents who presided before Woodrow Wilson , when the size and scope of executive branch was much smaller .
Eland makes the case for ranking the presidents based on whether their policies promoted peace , prosperity and liberty .
He ranks the presidents on each of those three components and compares his PP&L rankings with the alternative rankings made by the Federalist Society / Wall Street Journal , the Siena Research Institute , and free - market economists Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway .
The Peace Presidents
The Founders of the republic recognized that the United States had a fairly secure position against most military threats , with weak neighbors at its borders and two oceans buffering it from the worlds conflict zones .
These advantages allowed the United States to stay out of most foreign wars and to avoid maintaining large standing armies in peacetime , which the Founders  viewed as a threat to civil liberties .
More recently , however , presidents have tended to abandon that foreign policy for one of overseas interventionism , a trend Eland views as counterproductive and costly .
Consistent with the Founders vision and in stark contrast to rankings that often reward presidents simply because they provided leadership during wartime Elands ranking method gives presidents credit for avoiding wars and for conducting only necessary wars of self - defense .
 Presidents receive demerits for conducting wars of choice that is , most wars in U.S. history ,  Eland writes .
In the category of promoting peace , Eland gives his highest rankings to three presidents : John Tyler , Warren Harding , and Herbert Hoover .
Tyler exercised restraint in dealing with an internal rebellion , a bloody Indian war , and a boundary dispute with Canada .
In foreign policy , Harding was exceptional , keeping the U.S. out of the entangling alliance of the League of Nations , negotiating a separate peace with Germany , and securing the first significant arms control agreement in U.S. history .
Hoover , although a proponent of U.S. interventionism abroad , showed restraint in foreign policy by avoiding sanctions and not threatening force against Japan after its invasion of Manchuria and by eschewing Wilsonian interventionism in Latin America .
Eland gives his lowest peace rankings to six presidents : James Madison ( invasion of Spanish Florida , the War of 1812 ) , James Polk ( Mexican War ) , William McKinley ( Spanish - American War ) , Woodrow Wilson ( World War I , massive U.S. meddling overseas ) , Harry S Truman ( Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Cold War , Korean War , interventionism in the Middle East and elsewhere , the military - industrial complex ) , and George W. Bush ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) with John F. Kennedy ( Cuban Missile Crisis , Bay of Pigs , Vietnam ) and Lyndon Johnson ( Vietnam ) tied for the second lowest rankings in the peace category .
Promoting Prosperity
The Founders of the American republic generally believed that free - market policies would lead to prosperity , and they built that nations economy into the largest on earth on that principle .
Accordingly , although other analysts  assessments often reward presidential activism in the economy ,
Eland deducts points for activism that violated the Founders original ideas and rewards presidents who encouraged the private sector to resolve problems with minimal government intervention in the economy .
It is crucial to keep in mind that economic performance during one administration can be determined by policies enacted by prior administrations .
 Jimmy Carter experienced stagflation during his administration , which was primarily caused by LBJ and Nixons Vietnam War and their economic mismanagement ,  Eland writes .
 Yet Carter fostered economic policies that eventually led to the prosperity of the Reagan years and set a precedent for policies that led to renewed prosperity during the Clinton years . 
In the category of promoting prosperity , Eland gives his highest rankings to John Tyler , Martin Van Buren , and Rutherford B. Hayes .
Tyler supported a sound policy of limiting the growth of the money supply , and generally opposed high tariffs , a national bank , and federal welfare to the states .
Van Buren showed proper restraint during an economic crisis and worked toward limiting federal and executive power .
Hayes returned the United States to the anti-inflationary gold standard ( which helped pull the economy out of a recession ) , restored the nations credit , and kept federal troops out of a violent labor dispute .
Eland gives his lowest prosperity rankings to two presidents : Franklin D. Roosevelt ( the New Deal , wartime expansion of the state ) and Lyndon Johnson ( the Great Society and other federal programs ) .
Closely behind are William McKinley ( new taxes , favoritism for select businesses , progressivism ) , Woodrow Wilson ( Federal Reserve System , Federal Trade Commission , renewed antitrust activism , groundwork for expanded government ) , and Harry S Truman ( Fair Deal , intervention in labor disputes , increased economic intervention ) .
Preserving Liberty
Many presidents have expanded the executive branch beyond what the Founders envisioned .
This inflation of presidential power has distorted the original system of checks and balances at the expense of the legislative branches of government and has resulted in the imperial presidency and the erosion of U.S. citizens liberties .
 Presidents often claim that they are preserving liberty while , at the same time , they are taking actions to subvert it ,  writes Eland .
Eland ranks George Washington as the best president in the category of preserving liberty , with John Tyler and Grover Cleveland tied for second place .
Although Washington expanded executive power beyond what the Constitution envisioned , he also limited presidential powers in crucial ways , stepped down after two terms , and ensured the survival of the new constitutional system .
Tyler favored limited government but fought members of his own party on this principle thereby torpedoing his chances for a second term .
Cleveland pursued benevolent policies toward Native Americans , including trying to protect land in Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) from white settlers , giving them U.S. citizenship , and doling out reservation land for individual Indians to farm under the Dawes Act .
Eland gives his lowest rankings in the liberty category to Woodrow Wilson ( National Guard encroachment , Espionage and Sedition Acts ) , with Thomas Jefferson ( Embargo Act , Indian policy ) ranked second lowest .
Tied for third lowest place are John Adams ( Alien and Sedition Acts ) , James Polk ( land grab , Indian and black war casualties ) , William McKinley ( suppressed freedoms abroad ) , Ronald Reagan ( Iran Contra scandal , signing statements ) , and George W. Bush ( expanded executive power , erosion of civil liberties ) .
Conclusion
Elands top presidents for the PP&L composite rankings Tyler , followed closely by Cleveland , Van Buren , and Hayes sound obscure to many today .
At the same time , Elands low rankings for Reagan , Kennedy , and FDR also put him out of step with most academics , pundits , and the public .
However , if we value peace , prosperity , and liberty and , especially , adherence to Constitutional strictures then the presidents must be judged according to their enthusiasm for principles which themselves may often run counter to popular prejudice .
 Most of the excellent  presidents are remembered as bland men with gray personalities , but they largely respected the Constitutions intention of limiting government and restraining executive power , especially in regard to making war ,  writes Eland .
 They realized that America is great not because of its governments activism at home and abroad , but because of the hard work and great ideas of private American citizens living in freedom .
In other words , they realized that peace , prosperity , and liberty are best achieved by the framers  notion of restricting government power . 
BOLOGNA , Italy  Struggling to pedal up the final hill of Stage 14 of the Giro d’Italia on Saturday , the Australian Simon Gerrans felt as if he were moving in slow motion .
Some of his European teammates had told him about this climb .
Evidently , they left out some tiny details , including how painfully steep and long it was .
At one point , the road rose so sharply to meet Gerrans ’s bike that he began to look over his shoulder , searching for riders ascending much more quickly .
But there was no one .
“ When I was at the top , I thought someone was going to catch me because I was going really slow , ” he said after the 107 - mile stage in 90 - plus - degree weather .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday a Texas federal jury ordered the company to pay Canadian software firm i4i Ltd $ 200 million in damages for infringing a patent .
The world ’s largest software company , which is involved in a number of legal battles over patents , said the award was unsupported , and plans to appeal .
Toronto - based i4i , a privately held maker of software for manipulating documents , claimed in a 2007 suit that Microsoft knowingly infringed one of its patents in its Word processing application and its Vista operating system .
The patent concerned software for manipulating a document ’s content and architecture separately .
Microsoft denied infringement throughout the case .
“ The evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid , ” a Microsoft spokesman said .
“ We believe this award of damages is legally and factually unsupported , so we will ask the court to overturn the verdict . ”
i 4i did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
Last month , Microsoft was ordered to pay $ 388 million in damages for infringing a patent held by anti-piracy software maker Uniloc Inc .
It also appealing that verdict .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said late Monday that 15 of the top 20 recipients of $ 165 million in retention bonuses from American International Group Inc. 's Financial Products unit have agreed to give back their bonuses -- amounting to in excess of $ 30 million in cash .
Mr. Cuomo's office said , in all , AIG FP employees agreed to return about $ 50 million in bonuses thus far .

Sony is preparing to launch VidZone , a free music video streaming service that will exclusively hit the PlayStation 3 this Summer .
It 'll be integrated into the XMB menu and will allegedly feature thousands of videos that wo n't cost a single thin dime to watch .
The bigwigs in charge claim that VidZone is " backed by several Major record labels as well as thousands of Independent labels " , and will be available in the music section of the PS3's XMB menu .
Users will be able to compile and save their own video library , which will feature custom playlists that can be stopped , skipped and rewound at leisure .
PSP owners will be able to create these playlists on their handhelds as well , which will then be streamed on the PS3 .
VidZone CTO
Michael Russo says that VidZone will be " one of the world 's largest collection of music videos , allowing consumers to stream what they want , when they want it . "
This actually sounds really amazing , provided they get a wide variety of music and not just a load of SugaBabes and Girls Aloud bullsh*t .
Stream me some nineties Eurobeat videos and this is definitely one feature I can happily get behind .
Well done Sony .
You 're really starting to make non-stupid decisions lately .
Apartment rents are falling across most of Southern California as unemployed tenants double up with friends or family and the affordability of foreclosed homes makes some renters into buyers , a new survey has found .
The average rent in Los Angeles County fell almost 4 % in 2008 as apartment occupancy rates dropped and new units came online .
The decline should continue this year as more renters lose their jobs , according to the annual USC Casden Forecast expected to be released by the university today .
“ In L.A . County alone , 41,000 people moved out of apartments last year compared to the 29,000 people who moved in during the last five years , ” said forecast director Delores Conway .
To keep their units occupied , some landlords are lowering rents or offering concessions for signing a lease , such as a month of free rent or a reduced deposit , she said .

Rents should level out in 2010 as the economy recovers , the report said .
The average one - bedroom apartment in Los Angeles rented for $ 1,397 a month at the end of last year .
Some markets are doing better than others for landlords .
The Westside remains the priciest , while Pasadena and Burbank are stable with little change in occupancy or rents .
Rents in Hollywood and central neighborhoods such as downtown Los Angeles are being weakened by new condominiums that are being leased rather than occupied by owners .
The San Fernando Valley should continue to see lower occupancy rates and rents in the near term because of layoffs in the area .
Long Beach and the San Gabriel Valley are also more affordable than other neighborhoods , Conway said .
Orange County is generally stronger than the rest of the region , the report said , though rents came down 2 % last year and should slip a little more in 2009 .
High home prices in the area and tight credit should keep the pool of renters large , however .
The average one - bedroom unit there rented for $ 1,310 at the end of last year .

The Inland Empire suffered more from the recession .
Rents there already have declined significantly since their peak in 2006 and will slip a little more before stabilizing in 2010 , the report said .
Average rent for a one - bedroom at the end of last year was $ 912 per month .
San Diego County ’s apartment market has n’t faltered much , even though it has felt the sting of rising unemployment and reduced consumer spending .
Although rents are softening in some neighborhoods , they are likely to remain stable this year and increase slightly next year , the report said .
The average one - bedroom rented for $ 1,162 at the end of 2008 .

The 1967 War
Mounting tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbours culminated in six days of hostilities starting on 5 June 1967 and ending on 11 June - six days which changed the face of the Middle East conflict .
Israel seized Gaza and the Sinai from Egypt in the south and the Golan Heights from Syria in the north .
It also pushed Jordanian forces out of the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Egypt 's powerful air force was put out of action on the first day of fighting when Israeli jets bombed it on the ground in a pre-emptive strike .
The territorial gains doubled the area of land controlled by Israel .
The victory heralded a new age of confidence and optimism for Israel and its supporters .
The UN Security Council issued resolution 242 , stressing " the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security " .
The resolution called for the " withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict " .
It also called for an end to " all claims or states of belligerency and respect for ... the sovereignty ... of every state in the area and their right to live in peace ... free from threats or acts of force " .
According to the UN , the conflict displaced another 500,000 Palestinians who fled to Egypt , Syria , Lebanon and Jordan .

Dear owner of https://moz.com
I have a web site , [ redacted ] , and have spent a lot of time and effort to ensure my visitors gain the maximum benefit from their visit , and from what I have to offer .
As our web sites are closely related and our products do not compete , I feel the exchanging of links would be a mutually beneficial arrangement .
If you are interested in exchanging links , please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience .
Best regards ,

This particular client had a lot of user generated pages , so I contact these users to see if they were willing to link to their page from a personal website or blog .
I color coded responses -- blue and green were " Yes " as in we were able to get a link ( I do n't remember what the difference between blue and green were , though I probably had a good reason for it 3 years ago ) , yellow was " N/A , " meaning the contact did n't have a website , and red was " No " if we could n't get a link or if the link could n't pass any value for whatever reason .
So Scott emailed me 8 times in a little under 3 months .
The second email , titled " Backlink Request Reminder , " is pasted below : Okay , contrary to how Scott is ending his emails , this is clearly spam ( either that , or he 's a super lazy link builder and uses the same template each time he emails someone ) .
I do like how this email starts with " Did you happen to see my previous email ? " and then proceeds to have virtually the same content as last email .
I guess Scott 's betting that I did not see his previous email .
( He lost that bet . )
Also , I like how the PR of the page he 's trying to build links to has dropped from 2 to 0 in the three days that had passed since he last emailed me .
This is why you do n't list your page 's PR in link building email requests , people .
Talk about awkward .
Here 's his third email :
Hey , he 's linked to us , despite me never responding to his first two emails !
How thoughtful of him !
He also mentions how he supposedly has software that monitors his site 's links and that he 'll delete the link to our site if we do n't link back within 3 days .
I checked the page from where he supposedly linked to us , and lo and behold I indeed saw a link to SEOmoz ... although it 's still there after over 2 months , so I guess that whole " deleted after 3 days " claim is an empty threat .
Oh , and I like how Scott 's stopped ending his emails with " This is not spam ! "
I figured he was like , " Who am I kidding , I 'm a huge spammer " and came to terms with it .
My buddy Scott was quiet for a month , then it was lather , rinse , repeat .
I received another " Link Exchange Request " email on 3/4/09 that was identical to the first email he sent me .
Two days after that , he sent me Email # 5 and went with a new approach :
Okay , this email is pretty much making me do all the work .
You 're the one who wants the link , so why are you making me contact you ?
Flatter me a little -- talk about how much you like my site , outline how you 've got a similar site and would love for me to take a look at it , point me in the direction of a specific blog post or article , ask me to review or provide feedback , grovel for a link , etc .
Ass kissing gets you far in the world of building links .
Emails 6 and 7 were identical to Email # 3 , and Email # 8 was identical to Email # 2 ( confusing , I know ) .
I never respond to Scott 's requests , so naturally he assumes I 'm still interested and keeps spamming me with automatic link request emails a few times a month .
You gotta love that tenacity !
Even though it seems clear that I 'm on some sort of automated spam list , a main lesson to be derived from Scott 's Memento - esque emails is that you should Maintain a spreadsheet or a list of contacts and keep track of your efforts .
When I first started working at SEOmoz , I was tasked with building links for one of our clients .
Below is a screenshot of an example spreadsheet I created : I created a lot of basic spreadsheets similar to this one , where I 'd have info on the page from where I was trying to obtain a link , contact info , how many times I contacted someone , whether I received a response and what the response was , and if I was able to get a link to the site .
Being organized minimizes sloppy mistakes like contacting the same person more than once with the same introductory email .
In 2007 Melanie Nathan authored a fantastic post for YOUmoz about creating and managing your link campaign , which is a great resource on how to get organized and keep track of your link building efforts .
Sorry Scott , but you lose .
This is n't the best way to go about getting a link from us .
While I do n't doubt that this tactic has resulted in some success ( otherwise why would he keep doing it ? ) , if you 've got a remotely reputable site or any pride whatsoever , you wo n't go about acquiring your links this way , lest you want to be ridiculed for being unprofessional , spammy , and a dumb-ass .
I still think that contacting site owners and webmasters for links is an important strategy , but there definitely are better ways to craft your link request campaign than the one I highlighted in this post .

Democrats on Capitol Hill Rebel Against President Obama 's Guantanamo Bay Plan Lawmakers want Obama to present a plan on how he plans to close detainee center .
May 20 , 2009  -- The U.S. Senate today voted overwhelmingly to block funding to shut down the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , dealing another blow to one of President Obama 's signature national security issues .
In a 90 - 6 vote , the Senate followed in the footsteps of the House of Representatives and passed an amendment deleting $ 80 million in funds from a war funding bill earmarked to close the Guantanamo Bay prison .
Republicans have been raising alarm bells for weeks about the prospect of Obama 's planned Guantanamo closure .
Where will the detainees go , they 've asked over and over .
Will they be tried in the United States ?
And will former detainees , if cleared of the charges against them , be walking the U.S. streets ?
Democrats have answered by rejecting Obama 's request for money to start the base closure .
" Democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president .
We will never allow terrorists to be released into the United States , " declared Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , at a press conference Tuesday after meeting with other Democratic senators .
Obama had requested the $ 80 million from the $ 91 billion war funding bill as part of his promise to close the Guantanamo base by January 2010 .
If he wants to meet his January pledge , the president will now have to ask for the money later this year .
Detainees in Legal Limbo
There are 240 detainees currently housed at Guantanamo Bay .
Of those , 80 are awaiting trial , two have been released in Europe in recent months , and 130 are in some sort of legal limbo .
One of those detainees , top al Qaeda suspect Ahmed Ghailani , will be tried in New York City , an administration source told ABC News .
Ghailani , who has been in custody since 2004 and has been at Guantanamo since 2006 , was indicted in federal court in New York City for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 .
Those attacks killed 224 people , including 12 Americans .
In passing the amendment to remove the $ 80 million from the war funding bill needed to close the base , the Senate communicated that Obama must first present a plan for how he plans to close the detainee center and what he plans to do with the detainees housed there .
" The U.S. Senate , Democrats and Republicans do n't want terrorists released in the United States , " said Reid , although he maintains , as does Obama , that closing Guantanamo Bay is the right thing to do .
Reid became exasperated with reporters when pressed to connect the dots between closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and not bringing detainees to U.S. shores .
" If terrorists are released in the United States , part of what we do n't want is for them be put in prisons in the United States .
We do n't want them around the United States , " Reid said .
Republican Furor Over Gitmo Closure
Reid 's words echo the talking points of Republicans , particularly Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , who has pressured Democrats for weeks on Guantanamo Bay .
But while Reid ultimately wants to see the base closed , Republicans like McConnell see it as the perfect place to keep suspected terror detainees , many of whom have now been housed in Cuba for seven years .
" In my view , these men are exactly where they belong : locked up in a safe and secure prison , and isolated many miles away from the American people , " McConnell said on the Senate floor today .
" Guantanamo is a secure .
state - of - the - art facility .
It 's got courtrooms for military commissions .
Everyone who visits is impressed with it , " he said .
" Even the administration acknowledges that Guantanamo is humane and well - run .
Americans want these men kept out of their backyards and off the battlefield .
Guantanamo guarantees it . "
FBI Director Robert Mueller fueled the concerns sparked by Republicans .
In testimony before a House panel today , Mueller said he could not get into specific discussions about releasing Guantanamo detainees into the United States , but he told the panel , " The concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the United States run from concerns about providing financing , radicalizing others .
... All of those are concerns . "
" There is a potential for radicalization in a number of ways , whether it be for gang activity , for terrorist groups , for other extremists , " he said .
Mueller used an analogy with gangs that pose threats in U.S. prisons and are able to recruit from within the prisons , saying , " There are individuals in our prisons today who operate gangs inside our prisons . "
Two Other Measures Up for a Vote
The Senate will also consider two Republican amendments with more far - reaching consequences .
First is a proposal by McConnell that would require a threat assessment on any detainee before he is released from Guantanamo Bay or moved anywhere , not just the United States .
The assessment would address the prospects for recidivism -- whether the detainee would return to the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Second is a proposal from Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe that would explicitly ban the administration from using any money in this bill , or past bills , to move Gitmo detainees to the United States .
Both of these measures stand a good chance of passing and , therefore , putting the Senate on record in opposition an issue that tops Obama 's national security agenda .
Obama Reinstates Military Tribunals
Obama seemed to answer some of the concern among his party members about the detainees when he announced last week that he would re-instate a system of military tribunals originally enacted by President Bush to try detainees by a military court .
While Obama promised to retool the tribunals and account for more rights for the detainees undergoing trial , many civil libertarians criticized the move .
Lately , some of the loudest voices against moving detainees to the United States have been Democrats .
Virginia Sen. Jim Webb -- whose state would likely host detainees if they were to be tried in the American criminal justice system instead of on Cuba -- said Sunday on " This Week With George Stephanopoulos " that he would not support bringing detainees stateside .
" I think Guantanamo has become the great Rorschach test of how we feel about international terrorism .
We should at the right time close Guantanamo , but I do n't think that it should be closed in terms of transferring people here , " he said .
Other Democrats have stuck up for Obama and argue that the American prison and judicial systems are more than capable of handling detainees .
International terrorists like Zacharias Moussoaui , the so - called 20th hijacker of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and Richard Reid , the shoe bomber , along with people convicted of the 1993 attacks are in U.S. prisons already .
" If we can safely hold these individuals , I believe we can safely hold any Guantanamo detainees who need to be held , " said Durbin on the Senate floor .
" I should note , no prisoner has ever escaped in the United States , period .
Republicans also claim the administration wants to release terrorists in our communities , some kind of work release , walking around situation for terrorists .
What an incredible charge , and patently false .
President Obama has made clear that Guantanamo will be closed in a manner consistent with our national security . "

Best Cities : It 's All About Jobs [ Kiplinger ]
It has been a bad week for social media — based on the headlines , at least .
News reports have linked Facebook use to poor grades , while Twitter wound up being accused of putting morality itself at risk .
Needless to say , the studies behind the headlines did n't lend themselves to this sort of easy characterization .
This is a relatively common occurrence — it 's rare for a month to go by where we do n't consider doing a story that primarily involves debunking a news report that gets the science wrong .
But this time , we decided to try to trace back and figure out how these stories developed .
Facebook and failure
The Facebook stories start with a study by an Ohio State graduate student , Aryn Karpinski , who surveyed Ohio State students on their use of Facebook .
Karpinski obtained a variety of additional information on her subjects ' activities and grades , and her data revealed correlations between using the social networking site and a variety of factors , such as the student 's major , extracurricular activities , time spent at work , and grades .
An abstract on the work was accepted for presentation at the American Educational Research Association 's annual meeting , where Karpinski will be presenting her work on Thursday .
The work started to leave the standard academic publication track when a press officer at Ohio State saw the abstract .
" The Ohio State Director of Research Communications noticed the abstract in the program , " Karpinski said , " and he made the decision to go with a press release . "
That press release exercises the same sort of caution that Karpinski did when talking with Ars , noting that the survey results are a pilot study and recognizing the limits of the data .
" We can't say that use of Facebook leads to lower grades and less studying , " she 's quoted as saying , " but we did find a relationship there . "
That press release attracted the attention of someone at The Sunday Times of London , who prepared a story on the work .
" I was given the opportunity to see an early version of The Times ' story , and everything looked good with that , " Karpinski told Ars , but things went downhill from there .
" First , they broke the embargo , " she said .
" They were supposed to hold the story until the presentation [ scheduled for April 16 ] , but it wound up being published on Sunday [ the 12th ] , and the story that got published was different from the one I had seen . "
In her view , the published version of the story blurs the lines between correlation and causation , and does n't accurately convey her understanding of things .
" For example , there 's a point where they use the term ' significant ' in quotes , in a way that implies I said it , " Karpinsky said .
" For me , significant means something very specific — it 's a p value — and it was n't used that way in this context . "
Karpinski was quick to note that most coverage of her work did a much better job — she cited everyone from USA Today to The Chronicle of Higher Education as getting things right — but the report in The Sunday Times came out first , and probably had a large influence on how the study was perceived .
For her part , Karpinski is n't even sure what she 's going to do with the data .
She 's interested in performing multiple regression analysis to try to identify whether there might be other factors worth looking at , but trying to go beyond the correlations she has seen will be challenging .
" The sort of longitudinal study that might provide some perspective on causation probably is n't possible anymore , " she said , given the high rates of Facebook use .
If nothing else , the widespread reporting of her results may help university faculty , as she said , " hopefully , it 'll be a teaching moment about the difference between correlation and causation . "
Experiments and interpretations of moral behavior
The second round of stories focused on the negative impact that rapid - fire media could have on aspects of the emotional processing of moral and ethical behavior .
The stories are based on a publication that will appear in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science sometime this week .
Due to the way that PNAS releases stories , however , the paper itself is n't yet available to anyone but the press , who were able to report on it starting Monday evening .
The paper itself is both solid and interesting .
Researchers developed a set of stories and images that evoked various complex feelings about others : compassion for physical and social discomfort , and admiration for the skillful or virtuous behavior of others .
Most of the paper describes the use of functional MRI imaging to track the regions of the brain that were involved in processing these stories , identifying a set of overlapping but distinct areas that handled the four different classes of stories .
The authors also tracked the timecourse of this response in one brain structure , and saw that the response to physical pain peaked the earliest , at about six seconds after the stimulus ; the rest did n't hit their peak until roughly four seconds later .
The precise details of this timing experiment are in the supplemental data for this paper , which was n't yet available as of Thursday morning .
It appears that the researchers used indications of an emotional response , such as changes in breathing and heart rate , to normalize the start of the timing .
The timing experiments occupy a small part of the paper , and a correspondingly small part of the paper 's discussion .
But that part is striking for how it suggests these few seconds may have significant societal implications :
If replicated , this finding could have import and implications for the role of culture and education in the development and operation of social and moral systems ; in order for emotions about the psychological situations of others to be induced and experienced , additional time may be needed for the introspective processing of culturally shaped social knowledge .
The rapidity and parallel processing of attention - requiring information , which hallmark the digital age , might reduce the frequency of full experience of such emotions , with potentially negative consequences .
In short , the paper suggests digital media may make us too busy to fully register examples of others engaged in ethical behavior .
The language used by the authors — " may " and " could " feature prominently — is appropriately cautious but , even then , this seems like a significant extrapolation from the results .
The method used to track brain activity lags the involvement of the actual neurons , which exaggerates the time required to detect the signal , and the differences among the responses were small relative to the total signal ( which , in turn , is small relative to the overall brain activity ) .
More significantly , the data is also , as it is in Karpinski 's case , a correlation ; the brain activity being tracked is associated with the emotional impact of the stories , but it 's not clear that it signifies the " full experience of such emotions . "
Even assuming the connection is real and significant , it 's not clear that the digital era has presented unique opportunities for distraction , or whether a distraction would even interfere with the signals detected in these experiments .
That latter possibility could be tested ; so far , the test has n't been reported .
So , it appears that this small portion of the paper contains some speculation that , when phrased cautiously , made it through peer review .
Twittering away morality
Somehow , on the road to the public , this small bit of speculation became the focus .
For this , it appears we can thank the press release , which was originally entitled " Tweet this : Rapid - fire media may confuse your moral compass . "
( This release has since been significantly revised . )
The few seconds of lag between when responses peaked is described vaguely as " much longer " and the potential that rapid changes of topic could interfere with emotional processing — which is purely hypothetical — is presented as a given :
" The study raises questions about the emotional cost — particularly for the developing brain — of heavy reliance on a rapid stream of news snippets obtained through television , online feeds or social networks such as Twitter .
It 's no surprise , given the press release , that , when reports on the study appeared , they largely followed along the same lines .
So , for example , CNN 's coverage of the study began with , " rapid - fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social - networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering , scientists say . "
The CNN report mentioned Twitter five times .
Britain 's Daily Mail went further , headlining its article " Twitter can make you immoral , claim scientists . "
To be fair , the story also sparked a number of skeptical responses , but those tended to filter out over several days after the initial round of articles appeared .
While Mischel was beginning to dismantle the methods of his field , the Harvard psychology department was in tumult .
In 1960 , the personality psychologist Timothy Leary helped start the Harvard Psilocybin Project , which consisted mostly of self - experimentation .
Mischel remembers graduate students ’ desks giving way to mattresses , and large packages from Ciba chemicals , in Switzerland , arriving in the mail .
Mischel had nothing against hippies , but he wanted modern psychology to be rigorous and empirical .
And so , in 1962 , Walter Mischel moved to Palo Alto and went to work at Stanford .
There is something deeply contradictory about Walter Mischel — a psychologist who spent decades critiquing the validity of personality tests — inventing the marshmallow task , a simple test with impressive predictive power .
Mischel , however , insists there is no contradiction .
“ I ’ve always believed there are consistencies in a person that can be looked at , ” he says .
“ We just have to look in the right way . ”
One of Mischel ’s classic studies documented the aggressive behavior of children in a variety of situations at a summer camp in New Hampshire .
Most psychologists assumed that aggression was a stable trait , but Mischel found that children ’s responses depended on the details of the interaction .
The same child might consistently lash out when teased by a peer , but readily submit to adult punishment .
Another might react badly to a warning from a counsellor , but play well with his bunkmates .
Aggression was best assessed in terms of what Mischel called “ if - then patterns . ”
If a certain child was teased by a peer , then he would be aggressive .
One of Mischel ’s favorite metaphors for this model of personality , known as interactionism , concerns a car making a screeching noise .
How does a mechanic solve the problem ?
He begins by trying to identify the specific conditions that trigger the noise .
Is there a screech when the car is accelerating , or when it ’s shifting gears , or turning at slow speeds ?
Unless the mechanic can give the screech a context , he ’ll never find the broken part .
Mischel wanted psychologists to think like mechanics , and look at people ’s responses under particular conditions .
The challenge was devising a test that accurately simulated something relevant to the behavior being predicted .
The search for a meaningful test of personality led Mischel to revisit , in 1968 , the protocol he ’d used on young children in Trinidad nearly a decade earlier .
The experiment seemed especially relevant now that he had three young daughters of his own .
“ Young kids are pure id , ” Mischel says .
“ They start off unable to wait for anything — whatever they want they need .
But then , as I watched my own kids , I marvelled at how they gradually learned how to delay and how that made so many other things possible . ”
A few years earlier , in 1966 , the Stanford psychology department had established the Bing Nursery School .
The classrooms were designed as working laboratories , with large one - way mirrors that allowed researchers to observe the children .
In February , Jennifer Winters , the assistant director of the school , showed me around the building .
While the Bing is still an active center of research — the children quickly learn to ignore the students scribbling in notebooks —
Winters is n’t sure that Mischel ’s marshmallow task could be replicated today .
“ We recently tried to do a version of it , and the kids were very excited about having food in the game room , ” she says .
“ There are so many allergies and peculiar diets today that we do n’t do many things with food . ”
“ I want to be feared as a tyrant , loved as a father , and revered as a god , but I also want them to think I ’m funny . ”

Mischel perfected his protocol by testing his daughters at the kitchen table .
“ When you ’re investigating will power in a four - year - old , little things make a big difference , ” he says .
“ How big should the marshmallows be ?
What kind of cookies work best ? ”
After several months of patient tinkering , Mischel came up with an experimental design that closely simulated the difficulty of delayed gratification .
In the spring of 1968 , he conducted the first trials of his experiment at the Bing .
“ I knew we ’d designed it well when a few kids wanted to quit as soon as we explained the conditions to them , ” he says .
“ They knew this was going to be very difficult . ”
At the time , psychologists assumed that children ’s ability to wait depended on how badly they wanted the marshmallow .
But it soon became obvious that every child craved the extra treat .
What , then , determined self - control ?
Mischel ’s conclusion , based on hundreds of hours of observation , was that the crucial skill was the “ strategic allocation of attention . ”
Instead of getting obsessed with the marshmallow — the “ hot stimulus ” — the patient children distracted themselves by covering their eyes , pretending to play hide - and - seek underneath the desk , or singing songs from “ Sesame Street . ”
Their desire was n’t defeated — it was merely forgotten .
“ If you ’re thinking about the marshmallow and how delicious it is , then you ’re going to eat it , ” Mischel says .
“ The key is to avoid thinking about it in the first place . ”
In adults , this skill is often referred to as metacognition , or thinking about thinking , and it ’s what allows people to outsmart their shortcomings .
( When Odysseus had himself tied to the ship ’s mast , he was using some of the skills of metacognition : knowing he would n’t be able to resist the Sirens ’ song , he made it impossible to give in . )
Mischel ’s large data set from various studies allowed him to see that children with a more accurate understanding of the workings of self - control were better able to delay gratification .
“ What ’s interesting about four - year - olds is that they ’re just figuring out the rules of thinking , ” Mischel says .
“ The kids who could n’t delay would often have the rules backwards .
They would think that the best way to resist the marshmallow is to stare right at it , to keep a close eye on the goal .
But that ’s a terrible idea .
If you do that , you ’re going to ring the bell before I leave the room . ”
According to Mischel , this view of will power also helps explain why the marshmallow task is such a powerfully predictive test .
“ If you can deal with hot emotions , then you can study for the S.A.T. instead of watching television , ” Mischel says .
“ And you can save more money for retirement .
It ’s not just about marshmallows . ”
Subsequent work by Mischel and his colleagues found that these differences were observable in subjects as young as nineteen months .
Looking at how toddlers responded when briefly separated from their mothers , they found that some immediately burst into tears , or clung to the door , but others were able to overcome their anxiety by distracting themselves , often by playing with toys .
When the scientists set the same children the marshmallow task at the age of five , they found that the kids who had cried also struggled to resist the tempting treat .
The early appearance of the ability to delay suggests that it has a genetic origin , an example of personality at its most predetermined .
Mischel resists such an easy conclusion .
“ In general , trying to separate nature and nurture makes about as much sense as trying to separate personality and situation , ” he says .
“ The two influences are completely interrelated . ”
For instance , when Mischel gave delay - of - gratification tasks to children from low - income families in the Bronx , he noticed that their ability to delay was below average , at least compared with that of children in Palo Alto .
“ When you grow up poor , you might not practice delay as much , ” he says .
“ And if you do n’t practice then you ’ll never figure out how to distract yourself .
You wo n’t develop the best delay strategies , and those strategies wo n’t become second nature . ”
In other words , people learn how to use their mind just as they learn how to use a computer : through trial and error .
But Mischel has found a shortcut .
When he and his colleagues taught children a simple set of mental tricks — such as pretending that the candy is only a picture , surrounded by an imaginary frame — he dramatically improved their self - control .
The kids who had n’t been able to wait sixty seconds could now wait fifteen minutes .
“ All I ’ve done is given them some tips from their mental user manual , ” Mischel says .
“ Once you realize that will power is just a matter of learning how to control your attention and thoughts , you can really begin to increase it . ”
Marc Berman , a lanky graduate student with an easy grin , speaks about his research with the infectious enthusiasm of a freshman taking his first philosophy class .
Berman works in the lab of John Jonides , a psychologist and neuroscientist at the University of Michigan , who is in charge of the brain - scanning experiments on the original Bing subjects .
He knows that testing forty - year - olds for self - control is n’t a straightforward proposition .
“ We ca n’t give these people marshmallows , ” Berman says .
“ They know they ’re part of a long - term study that looks at delay of gratification , so if you give them an obvious delay task they ’ll do their best to resist .
You ’ll get a bunch of people who refuse to touch their marshmallow . ”
This meant that Jonides and his team had to find a way to measure will power indirectly .
Operating on the premise that the ability to delay eating the marshmallow had depended on a child ’s ability to banish thoughts of it , they decided on a series of tasks that measure the ability of subjects to control the contents of working memory — the relatively limited amount of information we ’re able to consciously consider at any given moment .
According to Jonides , this is how self - control “ cashes out ” in the real world : as an ability to direct the spotlight of attention so that our decisions are n’t determined by the wrong thoughts .
Last summer , the scientists chose fifty - five subjects , equally split between high delayers and low delayers , and sent each one a laptop computer loaded with working - memory experiments .
Two of the experiments were of particular interest .
The first is a straightforward exercise known as the “ suppression task . ”
Subjects are given four random words , two printed in blue and two in red .
After reading the words , they ’re told to forget the blue words and remember the red words .
Then the scientists provide a stream of “ probe words ” and ask the subjects whether the probes are the words they were asked to remember .
Though the task does n’t seem to involve delayed gratification , it tests the same basic mechanism .
Interestingly , the scientists found that high delayers were significantly better at the suppression task : they were less likely to think that a word they ’d been asked to forget was something they should remember .
In the second , known as the Go / No Go task , subjects are flashed a set of faces with various expressions .
At first , they are told to press the space bar whenever they see a smile .
This takes little effort , since smiling faces automatically trigger what ’s known as “ approach behavior . ”
After a few minutes , however , subjects are told to press the space bar when they see frowning faces .
They are now being forced to act against an impulse .
Results show that high delayers are more successful at not pressing the button in response to a smiling face .
When I first started talking to the scientists about these tasks last summer , they were clearly worried that they would n’t find any behavioral differences between high and low delayers .
It was n’t until early January that they had enough data to begin their analysis ( not surprisingly , it took much longer to get the laptops back from the low delayers ) , but it soon became obvious that there were provocative differences between the two groups .
A graph of the data shows that as the delay time of the four - year - olds decreases , the number of mistakes made by the adults sharply rises .
The big remaining question for the scientists is whether these behavioral differences are detectable in an fMRI machine .
Although the scanning has just begun — Jonides and his team are still working out the kinks — the scientists sound confident .
“ These tasks have been studied so many times that we pretty much know where to look and what we ’re going to find , ” Jonides says .
He rattles off a short list of relevant brain regions , which his lab has already identified as being responsible for working - memory exercises .
For the most part , the regions are in the frontal cortex — the overhang of brain behind the eyes — and include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , the anterior prefrontal cortex , the anterior cingulate , and the right and left inferior frontal gyri .
While these cortical folds have long been associated with self - control , they ’re also essential for working memory and directed attention .
According to the scientists , that ’s not an accident .
“ These are powerful instincts telling us to reach for the marshmallow or press the space bar , ” Jonides says .
“ The only way to defeat them is to avoid them , and that means paying attention to something else .
We call that will power , but it ’s got nothing to do with the will . ”
The behavioral and genetic aspects of the project are overseen by Yuichi Shoda , a professor of psychology at the University of Washington , who was one of Mischel ’s graduate students .
He ’s been following these “ marshmallow subjects ” for more than thirty years : he knows everything about them from their academic records and their social graces to their ability to deal with frustration and stress .
The prognosis for the genetic research remains uncertain .
Although many studies have searched for the underpinnings of personality since the completion of the Human Genome Project , in 2003 , many of the relevant genes remain in question .
“ We ’re incredibly complicated creatures , ” Shoda says .
“ Even the simplest aspects of personality are driven by dozens and dozens of different genes . ”
The scientists have decided to focus on genes in the dopamine pathways , since those neurotransmitters are believed to regulate both motivation and attention .
However , even if minor coding differences influence delay ability — and that ’s a likely possibility — Shoda does n’t expect to discover these differences : the sample size is simply too small .
In recent years , researchers have begun making house visits to many of the original subjects , including Carolyn Weisz , as they try to better understand the familial contexts that shape self - control .
“ They turned my kitchen into a lab , ” Carolyn told me .
“ They set up a little tent where they tested my oldest daughter on the delay task with some cookies .
I remember thinking , I really hope she can wait . ”
While Mischel closely follows the steady accumulation of data from the laptops and the brain scans , he ’s most excited by what comes next .
“ I ’m not interested in looking at the brain just so we can use a fancy machine , ” he says .
“ The real question is what can we do with this fMRI data that we could n’t do before ? ” Mischel is applying for an N.I.H. grant to investigate various mental illnesses , like obsessive - compulsive disorder and attention - deficit disorder , in terms of the ability to control and direct attention .
Mischel and his team hope to identify crucial neural circuits that cut across a wide variety of ailments .
If there is such a circuit , then the same cognitive tricks that increase delay time in a four - year - old might help adults deal with their symptoms .
Mischel is particularly excited by the example of the substantial subset of people who failed the marshmallow task as four - year - olds but ended up becoming high - delaying adults .
“ This is the group I ’m most interested in , ” he says .
“ They have substantially improved their lives . ”
Mischel is also preparing a large - scale study involving hundreds of schoolchildren in Philadelphia , Seattle , and New York City to see if self - control skills can be taught .
Although he previously showed that children did much better on the marshmallow task after being taught a few simple “ mental transformations , ” such as pretending the marshmallow was a cloud , it remains unclear if these new skills persist over the long term .
In other words , do the tricks work only during the experiment or do the children learn to apply them at home , when deciding between homework and television ?
Angela Lee Duckworth , an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania , is leading the program .
She first grew interested in the subject after working as a high - school math teacher .
“ For the most part , it was an incredibly frustrating experience , ” she says .
“ I gradually became convinced that trying to teach a teen - ager algebra when they do n’t have self - control is a pretty futile exercise . ”
And so , at the age of thirty - two , Duckworth decided to become a psychologist .
One of her main research projects looked at the relationship between self - control and grade - point average .
She found that the ability to delay gratification — eighth graders were given a choice between a dollar right away or two dollars the following week — was a far better predictor of academic performance than I.Q .
She said that her study shows that “ intelligence is really important , but it ’s still not as important as self - control . ”
Last year , Duckworth and Mischel were approached by David Levin , the co-founder of KIPP , an organization of sixty - six public charter schools across the country .
KIPP schools are known for their long workday — students are in class from 7:25 A.M. to 5 P.M. — and for dramatic improvement of inner-city students ’ test scores .
( More than eighty per cent of eighth graders at the KIPP academy in the South Bronx scored at or above grade level in reading and math , which was nearly twice the New York City average . )
“ The core feature of the KIPP approach is that character matters for success , ” Levin says .
“ Educators like to talk about character skills when kids are in kindergarten — we send young kids home with a report card about ‘ working well with others ’ or ‘ not talking out of turn . ’
But then , just when these skills start to matter , we stop trying to improve them .
We just throw up our hands and complain . ”
Self - control is one of the fundamental “ character strengths ” emphasized by KIPP — the KIPP academy in Philadelphia , for instance , gives its students a shirt emblazoned with the slogan “ Do n’t Eat the Marshmallow . ”
Levin , however , remained unsure about how well the program was working —
“ We know how to teach math skills , but it ’s harder to measure character strengths , ” he says — so he contacted Duckworth and Mischel , promising them unfettered access to KIPP students .
Levin also helped bring together additional schools willing to take part in the experiment , including Riverdale Country School , a private school in the Bronx ; the Evergreen School for gifted children , in Shoreline , Washington ; and the Mastery Charter Schools , in Philadelphia .
Google Wave , released earlier today , is already generating a lot of buzz , and for good reason : it 's a potential game changer in the realm of of email , IM , and project management .
But there a few key features that really speak to Google Wave 's potential .
Specifically , the fact that it is open - source and can be fitted with extensions and applications .
Today , the Google team showed off a few extensions for their new communication platform .
One of the most interesting ones , though , was Twave , a Twitter extension for Google Wave .
The integration makes sense : Google Wave and Twitter are both forms of real - time communication , so why not bring them together ?
The result , though , speaks to the potential applications of Google 's newest product .
Twave is an extension based on a Google Wave robot , which is an automated participant in a conversation .
It is basically how an extension can perform tasks within Google Wave - in this instance , a Google robot , named " Tweety . "
The result is a full stream of your Twitter feed within Google Wave .
Not only can you see tweets , but it looks like you can manage them like you would email , with replies , archiving , and even Google Wave 's awesome playback feature .
There were several other great extensions and robots that were demonstrated today .
Here 's just a few of the coolest ones :
- Debuggy : A robot that responds with debugging information about each event on a wave - Stocky : Automatically detects stock quotes and provides real - time stock information - Bloggy : Pushes wave content to a blog - Maps : Allows for collaboration on a Google map to plan events - Bidder :
You can turn a Wave into your own eBay - Ratings : All Wave participants can rate and review items - then it will show you a tally of the results .
These innovations are only the beginning of the many additions that developers will build for Google Wave .
The web is truly transforming into a real - time engine , and Google Wave +
Twitter is only the beginning .
Not only can we expect a slew of great Twitter applications within Google Wave , but some really innovative use of Google 's new real - time conversation platform .
Update :
We 've included another screenshot , this one showing a little more of what the Twave and Google Wave robots can do in general .
The Most Horrific Soccer Injury : Oupa Ngulube Breaks Leg In Half
Total Pro Sports – Soccer players are often accused of being divers and fakers , but make no mistake about it .
This sport can produce some of the most terrifying , excruciating , stomach - turning injuries .
Just over a year ago we saw Eduardo da Silva suffer a serious break , but this one we found makes it look like a Swedish massage .
In a South African Futbol League game between the Mpumalanga Black Aces FC and the Carara Kicks , a race for the ball down the sideline turned into what I am going labeling as “ The Most Disgusting Injury In Sporting History ” .
The perpetrator , Felix Muamba - Musasa of the Black Aces , has issued an apology to Oupa Ngubule of the Kicks , for the kick that has left his leg broken in two places .
“ Firstly , let me pass my unreserved apologies to the management of Carara Kicks as well as the family and friends of Oupa .
As a sportsman , I have never broken or intended to harm my fellow colleagues in any way in my life .
It was never my intention to go out and break his leg – it all happened when we both were going on a 50 - 50 challenge .
People should understand that soccer is a contact sport .
At the end of the day such accidents happen in the field of play . ”
“ I did not have a peaceful Sunday night after that incident .
My prayers are with the player to recover well and play soccer again .
I was devastated immediately when I saw the player still lying down in pain .
I am hard at prayer trying to come to terms with that incident . ”
This injury definitely beats Rick Ankiel almost breaking his neck .
Make sure you have a paper bag with you while you watch this .
I wish I did .
It seems the only thing 50/50 about that challenge was Oupa Ngubule ’s leg at the end of it .
Right In Half !

The Iowa Supreme Court recently struck down a ban on same sex or gay marriage .
I personally could not be happier for the homosexual constituents of Iowa and am glad to see that many are now getting married to their loved ones .
Some , however , cannot leave well enough alone …
There were already people lined up ready to protest this decision just hours after it was made .
Some Christians are currently in outrage , and I really want to know why … What will it harm the “ family ” to expand it ’s definition to same sex couples ?
Will it in any way affect the way you guide and lead your own family ?
I may have been really liberal as a Christian ( I was n’t on any other issue ) , but this is one of those issues I just could n’t
see eye to eye on with the established Right … I just never saw this Gay Mafia that I keep hearing about , I never thought that they were trying to do anything more than fight for their own rights .
Of course I may have kept it in mind to “ Love the sinner but hate the sin ” or something like that , but I just could n’t imagine myself trying to impede on the rights of others .
Maybe I just had way too many gay ( before and currently , both out and closeted ) friends to think about it in such a black and white way .
I , and many of my Atheist counterparts ( and homosexuals too ) would gladly take up arms and die to ensure that religious people had the rights to practice their religion freely so long as they do n’t attempt to subvert our own freedom in that practice .
That goes for the freedom to be and live as a homosexual however one pleases … that does n’t seem too hard for me , or very bizarre at that .
Why ca n’t Christendom , or Islam , … or well … anyone that enjoys the freedom of religion and the ability to marry the person you love stand up and fight for the rights of homosexuals rather than to fight against ?
I know I am kind of mixing two different issues here but I am doing that to make a point -
We all have causes that we are passionate about , one party wants freedom for itself , but too often it wants freedom for no other .
Freedom should be for all or it is n’t freedom ; it is n’t about right wing or left wing , theism or non-theism , gay or straight … it should quite simply be about freedom .
If we all work together to fight for the freedom of one another we can move on to greater issues in a peaceful way .
So , Christians or anyone else that applies — answer these questions for me :
What does it harm you if gay people can get married ?
If they can adopt children ?
Will it harm your family unit to live down the street from a same sex couple ?
or even to befriend them ?
You do n’t have to agree with everything a person does in order to love them or treat them with respect , I do n’t have to care about your angry god or his weird message of salvation to be able to believe and fight for your right to follow him .
Many of the founding fathers of this nation were Atheist , Deist , or Agnostic – yet they were adamant about having religious freedom written into the Constitution because they had seen the destruction and persecution that would come about if the Church and the State were too close together -
That is what we should all be fighting to prevent , and I think we should all just do that together .
Make Gay Rights an issue for everyone as a show of solidarity …
Make a statement that you value Freedom and want others to experience it the way you do .

Die " deutsche Maus " ( Bild : Computermuseum der Fakultät Informatik , Universität Stuttgart )
Vor einem knappen halben Jahr feierte die Technikwelt den 40 .
Jahrestag der " Mother of all Demos " , die am 9 .
Dezember 1968 die Computermaus an die Öffentlichkeit brachte .
Demo -Leiter Douglas Engelbart gilt seitdem als Erfinder des immer noch genialsten und griffigsten Eingabegeräts der Informatik .
Diese Ansicht muss jedoch korrigiert werden , denn schon einige Wochen vorher erschien eine Publikation der Firma Telefunken , die ein Input - Instrument vorstellte , das an Monitoren hing und funktionell der Engelbart - Maus gleichkam : die so genannte Rollkugel .
Seit den frühen 70er - Jahren wurde sie zusammen mit Telefunken - Rechnern verkauft und in der Praxis eingesetzt , und mindestens ein Exemplar hat in einem Museum überlebt .
Wann die Geschichte der Rollkugel genau beginnt , ist nicht mehr zu ermitteln .
Bekannt ist ein Vorläufer , ein Gerät ähnlich dem heutigen Trackball , das neben Radarschirmen eingelassen war und zum Abruf von Flugzeugdaten diente .
Von 1966 an produzierte die amerikanische Firma Orbit solche " Ball Tracker " , und vermutlich zur gleichen Zeit arbeitete ein kleines Team bei Telefunken in Konstanz an einem aufwendigen System für die Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung .
Es umfasste nicht nur den Radartisch und das , was in ihm steckte , sondern auch einen Computer vom Typ TR 86 , der die grafische Benutzeroberfläche erst möglich machte .
Leiter des Teams war der inzwischen 75 - jährige Rainer Mallebrein , der heute in Singen in der Nähe des Bodensees lebt .
Die " deutsche Maus " ( Ansicht von unten ) ( Bild : Computermuseum der Fakultät Informatik , Universität Stuttgart )
Schon seit 1965 entwickelte Telefunken den Großrechner TR 440 , mit dem man auch das neue Time - Sharing realisieren wollte .
Es lag nahe , für Eingaben an den dafür nötigen Terminals die Trackballs aus der Flugsicherung zu übernehmen .
Rainer Mallebrein erinnert sich , dass man es den Abnehmern des Computers nicht zumuten wollte , Löcher in Tische zu bohren und Eingabeeinheiten darin zu versenken .
Er fand eine elegantere Lösung , indem er die Kugel und den sie umgebenden Kugelhalter umdrehte , über ein Kabel mit dem Monitor verband und auf diese Weise beweglich machte .
Das war die Geburt der deutschen Computermaus .
Patentiert wurde sie offenbar nicht .
In Telefunken - Schriften aus den 60er - Jahren taucht mehrmals eine " Rollkugel " zur Steuerung elektronischer Schaltungen auf , doch sitzt sie stets in einer festen Halterung .
Solche Konfigurationen waren unter den Ingenieuren längst bekannt , und der Schritt zur mobilen Kugel wurde – so müssen wir rekonstruieren – als so geringfügig betrachtet , dass eine Patentanmeldung unterblieb .
Man machte sich noch nicht einmal die Mühe , dem Kind einen neuen Namen zu geben .
Es wird eigentlich nur aus Bildern oder Beschreibungen klar , dass eine Telefunken - Rollkugel kein stationärer Trackball mehr ist , sondern schon eine bewegte Maus .
Am 2 . Oktober 1968 – gut zwei Monate vor Douglas Engelbarts Demo – erschienen die " Technischen Mitteilungen " von AEG - Telefunken mit einem Artikel von Günter Neubauer über " Sichtgeräte in elektronischen Datenverarbeitungsanlagen " .
Er behandelte den Monitor SIG - 100 für vektorgrafische Darstellungen von Ziffern , Buchstaben , Sonderzeichen und Polygonen ; als Eingabemedien dienten Lichtgriffel , Lichtindikatoren und Rollkugeln .
" Mit ihnen " , schrieb der Autor , " ist es möglich , schnell und leicht ein Positionssymbol auf dem Schirm zu verschieben , Marken zu setzen und damit die Information zu verändern . "
Der Cursor wurde damals also auch schon erfunden .
Zum
Text gehörte ein Bild , das den SIG - 100 mit angeschlossener Rollkugel zeigt .
Der SIG - 100 mit angeschlossener Rollkugel ( Bild : Computerschausammlung der FH Kiel )
Ende 1968 wurde dann der erste TR - 440 - Computer bei einem Kunden , dem Deutschen Rechenzentrum Darmstadt , installiert ; in der Folgezeit verkaufte oder vermietete die Firma 45 weitere Systeme .
Zum Peripherie - Angebot zählte das über einen Satellitenrechner TR 86 anzuschließende Sichtgerät SIG - 100 , wobei die Rollkugel aber nur optional dazugehörte .
Wir wissen also nicht , ob die Telefunken - Maus schon 1968 zum Einsatz kam , belegt sind auf jeden Fall vier mobile Rollkugeln im Münchner Leibniz - Rechenzentrum anno 1972 .
Das war neun Jahre vor der ersten in den USA verkauften Maus , mit der man den Xerox Star bediente .
Vier Jahrzehnte nach ihrer Einführung ist es nicht leicht , anhand einer Funktionsbeschreibung , die zwischen 1968 und 1970 erschien und in der Kieler Computerschausammlung liegt , die Bedienung der Rollkugel zu rekonstruieren .
Sie besaß jedenfalls an der Oberseite einen zentralen Druckknopf , der sie ein- und die Tastatur ausschaltete , und ihre Hauptaufgabe war das Verschieben einer Sichtmarke auf dem Bildschirm .
Zum Zeichnen von Polygonzügen musste der Benutzer die Kugel aktivieren , die Marke durch Rollen über den Tisch verschieben , die Kugel ausschalten und eine Taste auf der Tastatur drücken .
Daraufhin wurden die letzte und die vorletzte Position des Cursors durch eine Linie verbunden .
Erstaunlich jedenfalls ist das hohe Niveau , das die grafische Datenverarbeitung schon in der 60er - Jahren in Konstanz erreichte und das heute weitgehend vergessen ist .
Zur Priorität ist zu bemerken , dass die deutsche und die amerikanische Computermaus sicher unabhängig voneinander entwickelt wurden , wobei Douglas Engelbart wahrscheinlich als Erster auf das Grundkonzept kam .
Bei der Publikation im Jahre 1968 hatte aber Telefunken die Nase vorn , und die Markteinführung geschah Jahre vor den US - Mäusen .
Traurig ist , dass die Rollkugel so schnell vergessen wurde und später , als die Maus zur Grundausstattung von Heim - und Personalcomputern gehörte , niemand mehr an sie erinnerte .
Im Internet findet sich eine versteckte ( und nicht ganz korrekte ) Reminiszenz von Rul Gunzenhäuser aus dem Jahr 1999 , und eine der deutschen Mäuse gibt es als Museumsstück in Stuttgart .
Nicht viel , aber vielleicht ein Anfang für weitere historische Forschungen .

A gotcha in programming is something unexpected although a documented feature of a computer system and not a bug .
These gotchas throw beginners off Javascript programming and send some people running and screaming .
In my opinion , Javascript is one of the most widespread languages as it is available on all browsers but one of the least learned languages .
Let ’s start with basic ones .
1. Floating point arithmetic
This can be a major cause of frustration for people who are new to Javascript and are trying to perform some kind of mathematical computation .
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> alert ( 0.02 / 0.1 ) ; //0.19999999999999998 < br />< br /> alert ( 1.14 * 100 ) ; //113.99999999999999 ;) < br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />
This is where the Math.round ( ) functions come in handy
2. Plus operator overloading
The plus operator stands for both arithmetic operations and also string concatenation .
This is convenient if used correctly .
Lets take a look
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> var msg , one= " 1 " ;< br />< br /> msg = 2 + " 1 " ; // msg = " 21 " < br />< br /> msg = 2 + one ; // msg = " 21 " < br />< br /> msg = 1 + 1 + 1 + " musketeers " ; // msg = " 3 musketeers " < br />< br /> msg = " Bond " + 0 + 0 + 7 ; //msg = " Bond 007 " < br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />
The above behaviour is because the operations are performed left to right .
If we use parantheses the behaviour will change based on the order of the string or number in it .
3. Semicolon insertion at line feed
Javascript automatically inserts ; at a line feed .
Lets see this in action with a simple example :
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> function returnSame(a ) {< br />< br /> return // Inserts semi-colon to convert to return ;< br />< br /> a //a becomes a ; - Unreachable < br />< br /> }< br />< br /> alert ( returnSame ( 2 ) ) ; // Output is undefined < br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />
The magical semicolon insertion can get things complicated while creating objects using object literals
4. typeof operator
typeof is a unary operator .
The results are not one would normally expect .
It suprisingly evaluates null to “ object ” .
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> var obj={} ; //object created using object literal < br />< br /> var arr= [ ] ; // array created by array literal < br />< br /> alert ( typeof ( obj ) ) ; //object - Good < br />< br /> alert ( typeof ( arr ) ) ; //object - Bad < br />< br /> alert ( typeof ( null ) ) ; //object - Ugly ! ;) < br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />
It should only be used to distingush objects from other primitive types .
5. false , null , undefined , NaN , Infinity
They stand for different things although they might look similar or at times look redundant .
Javascript uses three primitive datatypes numbers , strings and boolean .
In addition it has two trivial datatypes undefined and null .
Both null and undefined are equal according to the equality operator ( == )
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> var a ;< br />< br /> alert ( a ) ; //undefined < br />< br /> alert ( 1/0 ) ; //Infinity < br />< br /> alert ( 0/0 ) ; //NaN<br />< br /> 0/0 == 0/0 ; // false - a NaN != NaN < br />< br /> alert ( b ) ; //error < br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />
6 . String replace only replaces first occurence
Unlike PHP or other languages , string replace in Javascript only replaces the first occurence of a string by default .
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> var nospace = " I dont need spaces " . replace ( " " , " _ " ) ; < br />< br /> alert ( nospace ) ; // I_dont need spaces -
Only first occurence < br />< br /> var nospace = " I dont need spaces " . replace ( / /g , " _ " ) ; < br />< br /> alert ( nospace ) ; //I_dont_need_spaces<br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />
7. ParseInt function
This is used to convert a string into an integer .
The function does accept two arguments and the second argument specifies the radix .
The radix here for decimal is10 .
If no radix argument is passed the parseInt function tries to guess the base and in this case because the string starts with 0 , it is parsed as an octal number .
< br />< br /> < script >< br />< br /> var str = " 017 " ;< br />< br /> var strInt = parseInt ( str ) ; //strInt = 15 ;) < br />< br /> var strInt = parseInt ( str,10 ) ; //strInt = 17 < br />< br /> </ script >< br />< br />

REUTERS / Francois Lenoir
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Swiss bank UBS said on Thursday it had axed 2,000 U.S. jobs as part of its latest mammoth round of job cuts announced earlier in April .
“ I can confirm the 2,000 job cuts , ” said UBS spokesman Andreas Kern .
The world ’s biggest wealth manager employs nearly 30,000 people in the United States .
UBS had informed 600 U.S. financial advisors they would have to leave and said it was also cutting 1,400 back office staff , all in wealth management , said a report in Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger quoting a different UBS spokesman .
Recently appointed Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel announced on April 15 that UBS would cut 8,700 jobs as part of a new , radical restructuring plan that was aimed at bringing the troubled Swiss bank back to profit .
He said on that occasion that UBS would post a first - quarter net loss of 2 billion Swiss francs ( $ 1.76 billion ) when it reported results on May 5 .
UBS said at the time of the job - cut announcement that it would shed 2,500 positions in its homeland , Switzerland .
It gave no other details but an internal memo obtained by Reuters said the bank was planning to axe about 4,000 jobs at its prized wealth management division .
UBS ’ investment bank , whose hefty investments into risky U.S. assets has forced it to make more than $ 50 billion in writedowns , has been hit hard in previous rounds of job cuts .

There are plenty of reasons to be critical of Sol Trujillo 's performance as chief executive of Telstra .
Race is not one of them .
Kevin Rudd was foolish to take a cheap shot - saying " adios " - when Trujillo left .
And Trujillo is milking it as evidence that Australia is racist .
But come on , Sol .
You came to Australia and took up the prize job in Australia 's telecommunications industry .
After four years you are leaving with $ 30 million of cash and bonuses .
And you want us to believe you are a victim of racism ?
Trujillo has his critics .
Let 's recount some of the reasons .
When he started , the Telstra share price was about $ 5 .
After four years it is about 40 per cent lower and hovering a little above $ 3 .
You decide whether that is worth $ 30 million , but since the board offered , you can't blame Trujillo for accepting .

A significant crack has appeared in Kuwait 's glass ceiling after four women emerged winners in the Gulf state 's parliamentary elections at the weekend .
The victory marked the first time women have won parliamentary seats since given the right to vote and run for office in 2005 .
For the past 50 years Kuwait 's parliament has been the sole preserve of men .
In an election that saw fundamentalist groups lose ground , Massouma al - Mubarak , who was appointed Kuwait 's first female cabinet minister in 2005 , two US - educated professors , Salwa al - Jassar and Aseel al - Awadhi , and an economist , Rola Dashti all won seats in the Kuwaiti parliament .
" Frustration with the past two parliaments pushed voters to seek change .
And here it comes in the form of this sweeping victory for women , " al - Mubarak said today .
Aseel al - Awadhi told Reuters : " People voted for change because people are fed up with deadlocks .
It is time to focus on our priorities inside the parliament . "
Kuwait 's ruler , Sheikh Sabah al - Ahmad al - Sabah , called Saturday 's election – the second in a year – after dissolving parliament two months ago to end an impasse between MPs and the government , which is heavily influenced by the ruling family , over economic reform and alleged corruption .
The clash of wills between parliament and the government has almost halted development at a time when the country is grappling with the global financial crisis and falling oil revenues .
Project Kuwait , a plan to boost economic capacity , has never made it beyond committee level because of opposition from some MPs to the involvement of foreign firms in the energy sector .
Although the Islamists – who have opposed the government 's economic reforms – lost ground they still form a significant bloc with their allies from the conservative tribal areas .
The Islamists saw the number of seats they hold fall to 16 from 24 in the 50 - seat assembly .
Conservative tribal figures have 25 seats .
Kuwait has no officially recognised parties .
Candidates either belong to political groups , run independently or represent their tribes .
Voters in Saturday 's polls said they were fed up with years of clashes between MPs and cabinet members .
Al - Nisf , a newspaper columnist , said the win by female candidates was an achievement not only for Kuwait but around the region .
" They made it without organised political parties supporting them or a quota system .
This is a huge leap forward for Kuwait 's democracy , " he said .
Iraq 's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 played a crucial role in the liberalisation of women 's political and social rights .
At the time , many women assumed important responsibilities , volunteering in hospitals to compensate for the lack of medical staff , smuggling food , money , and weapons across military checkpoints .
He is the son of a Nazi police chief who once declared his love for the noted UN secretary general and war criminal , Kurt Waldheim , and who still talks as if he has just arrived on Austrian Airlines .
His rise to fame owes more to steroids than charm , and he is best known for impersonating a robot .
Meanwhile , his crude remarks about women have not helped him counter persistent allegations of groping .
It is not the most promising record on which to build your first campaign for American public office , but the fact is that Arnold Schwarzenegger has every chance of being elected governor of California on October 7 .
That says something about the pervasive mood of desperation in the Golden State these days , as it faces rapidly deteriorating public services , national ridicule and a $ 38bn deficit .
Californians are so angry they are about to vote on whether to fire the governor they elected last year , the hapless , lacklustre and aptly named Gray Davis .
But the prospect of " The Governator " taking power in Sacramento says more about the extraordinary willpower of Schwarzenegger himself .
Willpower that has propelled him along the winding road from the remote village of Thal amid the poverty and humiliation of a defeated country just two years after the second world war to the brink of political office in the US .
Wendy Leigh , Schwarzenegger 's unauthorised biographer , went to Austria to research his roots , and came away convinced he plotted his political rise from an early age , using body - building and films as stepping stones to escape from a depressing home .
There was certainly a lot to escape from .
His father , Gustav , a frequently drunk local police chief who had signed up for the Nazi party after the 1938 Anschluss , apparently made no secret of his preference for the elder , more strapping of his two sons , Meinhardt .
Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with the pursuit of power and at one point quotes him as saying : " I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders , not the large mass of followers .
I think it is because I saw leaders use 100 % of their potential ...
I was always fascinated by people in control of other people . "
It would , of course , not be the first time the son of an unpleasant minor official from provincial Austria rose to high office through sheer force of will .
But Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger is no Adolf Hitler , whatever you might have thought of Conan the Barbarian .
For one thing , he is quite liberal as far as Republicans go .
He supports abortion rights and gun controls , and said the impeachment of President Clinton made him " ashamed to be a Republican " .
Furthermore , Schwarzenegger could never rise to the top office in the land , as the constitution precludes those born outside the US from becoming president .
Then again , all it would take is a constitutional amendment , and if Arnie did a good job in California ...
But first Schwarzenegger has to win the governorship , and that will not be easy .
Ronald Reagan did it , of course , but only after spending years working his way up the Republican party ranks .
And Reagan was not carrying all Schwarzenegger 's foreign baggage .
Possibly with a political future in mind , Schwarzenegger has done all he can to cauterise the wound left by his father .
He commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Centre to research his wartime record , and it came up with no evidence of atrocities .
Nevertheless , the star made amends for Gustav Schwarzenegger 's political judgment by making generous and regular contributions to the Wiesenthal Centre , which presented him with a national leadership award for his humanitarian work .
" Every time he does a movie , he writes a cheque , " Rabbi Marvin Hier , the centre 's founder , said recently , pointing out that " Arnold is not his father . "
However , although his father may not have been a war criminal , Schwarzenegger sought out a fellow countryman who was .
He invited Kurt Waldheim to be guest of honour at his 1986 wedding , at a time when the former UN secretary general 's SS past was coming to the surface .
Schwarzenegger even made a point of mentioning him in his wedding speech , telling his guests : " My friends do n't want me to mention Kurt 's name because of the recent Nazi stuff - but I love him . "
However , Rabbi Hier has also absolved him of that surprising declaration of affection , arguing that the actor probably did not know the extent of Waldheim 's responsibility for atrocities in the Balkans .
As if SS links were not enough , there are the twinned issues of drugs and sex .
Schwarzenegger has admitted using steroids to boost his muscle bulk while he was building himself up for his Mr Universe titles and his breakthrough film Pumping Iron .
In that film he also appears to be smoking a spliff .
In fact , neither of those transgressions are likely to be too much of a barrier in California .
But the sex issue might be tougher .
This is not necessarily because of the allegations of groping , which were never proven , but of the offensive remarks to issue from his own mouth .
Back in 1988 , he told Playboy he would never allow his wife or mother to wear trousers when they were seen with him on the grounds that dresses are more feminine .
That was back in 1988 , of course , but he does not seem to have mellowed .
This is from an interview in last month 's Esquire magazine on the subject of blondes and brains :
" As much as when you see a blonde with great tits and a great ass , you say to yourself , ' Hey , she must be stupid or must have nothing else to offer ' , which maybe is the case many times .
But then again there is the one that is as smart as her breasts look , great as her face looks , beautiful as her whole body looks gorgeous , you know , so people are shocked . "
Not as shocked , perhaps , as California 's women voters will be when they hear that particular quote , as surely they will .
Davis 's political rottweiler and California 's answer to Alastair Campbell , Garry South , is already hard at work making sure that all the dirt on Schwarzenegger gets into the public domain early and often .
Two years ago , the last time Schwarzenegger was considering a run for the governor 's mansion , South gave him a taste of what a real fight might look like when there are no stunt doubles to take the fall .
He faxed political reporters a copy of a highly unflattering magazine piece on the Terminator star which referred to allegations of womanising , touching women inappropriately and his past behaviour as a body - builder .
He attached a helpful covering note : " Here is the long - awaited Premiere magazine exposé on might - be gubernatorial wannabe AH - nuhld Schwarzenegger ... the piece lays out a real ' touching ' story - if you get what I mean . "
People did .
Although friends of Schwarzenegger in the film world went public in his defence and attested to his moral decency , the faxes were seen as a warning shot of what might happen if he decided he wanted to mix it with the big boys .
Davis , who is unpopular and uncharismatic , is nonetheless respected for two things : his ability to raise money for his races and his dirty - tricks campaigns .
Schwarzenegger , already committed to promoting Terminator 3 , backed off from running against him last November , and pundits wondered if that was the last that would be heard of him on the political stage .
But , as the Schwarzenegger - as - android figure has so often promised us , he 's back .
And this time , he is much better positioned for the final assault on the governor 's house in Sacramento .
California is angrier and ready for an outsider to run against politics - as - usual .
The rules of the recall vote mean that he does not have to compete in a primary , and so does not have to convince Republican activists , who might not appreciate his liberal position on social issues and his marriage to John F Kennedy 's niece Maria Shriver .
Instead , that record will help sell him as a centrist and bring over floating voters .
The last Republican to be elected governor in California , Pete Wilson , took the same liberal stance on abortion and guns .
A 30 - strong team of political fixers who used to work for Wilson are now running the Schwarzenegger campaign .
They ran what many saw as a dry - run campaign in 2002 , promoting an initiative called proposition 49 , which designated money for after - school programmes aimed at keeping young people out of trouble .
It was not a very controversial measure - California has a major gang problem , with children as young as 13 involved - and it passed easily .
Schwarzenegger presented the case eloquently , however , and celebrated its victory at a project in the Latino area of east Los Angeles .
He clearly relished the adulation of the crowds gathered there for the results , who encouraged him to seek higher office .
He has already started wooing the Latino vote in the state , although it may require more than a few " hasta la vistas " to pluck them from their traditional Democratic party allegiance .
As well as starting out with name recognition that most politicians spend a lifetime trying to accrue , Schwarzenegger has another attribute essential to political success : money .
He made $ 30 m for his role in Terminator 3 , just about what a high - octane governorship campaign costs .
And that is just the proceeds from one film .
Schwarzenegger has a business empire , including shopping malls a Boeing 747 and large chunks of Santa Monica .
Declaring his candidacy on the Jay Leno show on Wednesday night , he managed to present his personal fortune as a guarantee that he would take the side of the man in the street .
He had so much money that he would not have to go cap in hand to the " special interests " .
" The biggest problem we have is that California is being run now by special interests , " Schwarzenegger declared .
" We have to stop that . "
In the wake of his Jay Leno appearance , he is ahead in the polls in a crowded field that includes the self - styled " smut peddler who cares " , the Hustler publisher Larry Flynt , half a dozen minor celebrities and more than 400 other aspiring Californians .
But Schwarzenegger , like his metallic alter - ego , has been known to self - destruct , and anyone who has seen The Last Action Hero or visited a Planet Hollywood ( which he started with Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis ) knows that he is not invincible .
But Stallone and Willis are yesterday 's action heroes .
Schwarzenegger is still going strong , fulfilling his plan .
It is a plan that he once chillingly spelled out to Playboy : " You have to create a need for yourself , build yourself up .
While their empire goes on , slowly , without realising it , build your own little fortress .
And all of a sudden it 's too late for them to do anything about it . "

ワールドカップを見て思うことは、やはり一流の選手は皆負けず嫌いだと言うこと。そして、超一流の選手はだいたい負けず嫌いの程度の超一流。
そしておそらく、負けず嫌いの程度においては、超一流のサッカー選手にも負けない超超負けず嫌いのビル・ゲイツが慈善事業を始めることには、もっと注目すべきである。
これ を 「 WEB2.0競争でGoogleやYouTubeに負けることが見えてきてボロが出る前に逃亡したのだ」と見るのは違うと私は思う。もちろん、状況は不利だと思うし、株価に影響するからそれをそのまま言えなくても、ゲイツも同じように考えているとは思う。ただ、ゲイツには潤沢なキャッシュがあるのだから、それを使えば、いかに時代からはずれようともマイクロソフトを支えることはできる。長年蓄積した有形無形の資産をそういうふうに吐き出してしまう会社も多いから、ゲイツがそれをしたって、非難されることはないかもしれない。
しかし、ゲイツは自分の手で時代を順方向に回すことの面白さを知ってしまった人間であり、そういう選択肢は彼にはあり得ない。
時代を逆方向に回すのに金を使うより、順方向に速める方が面白い。その方法をもうひとつゲイツは見つけたのである。
今は、金の重力定数が増大している時代である。小石と小石が、地球と月くらいの引力で引き合う。金と金が引きあってぶつかりあって、自動的に大きな塊を作り、その塊が雪だるま式に成長していく。金自身がそういう力学を内包しているのだから、それに乗っかるだけですぐ金を稼げる。だから、大金持ちになることはちょっと前ほど難しいことではない。
誰もが、とは言えないが、ちょっと頭がよくてガッツがあって運がいい人間なら、簡単に金を稼ぐ。大金を稼ぐことは、もはやエキサイティングな事業ではないのだ。実際、金を稼ぐことで、ゲイツの後を追っている人間はたくさんいる。
これからエキサイティングでチャレンジングなのは、金を使うことである。ゲイツは、金を使う側の人間としてのパイオニアになりたかったのである。
ゲイツは、おそらく自分の金が無駄になったりルーズな使い方をされたり無意味な使われ方をされるのは我慢ならない。慈善をするとなったら、目標を決め、そこに向かって全力で邁進する組織を作りあげた上で、一円たりとも無駄にせず、自分の金をそこにつぎこむだろう。
もともと、大量の頭のいい人間を組織化することにおいて、たぐいまれなる才能がある人間が、彼の長年の経験を生かして、「金を使う側」の組織を組み立てるのだ。さらにゲイツは、LinuxやAppleやGoogleからたくさんのことを学んでいる。もちろん、マイクロソフトの経営は偉大な事業であり、そこからもたくさん学んだはずだ。でも、競争相手から学んだことで、事業の戦略上の要因から自社に適用できなかったことがいくつかあるだろう。今度彼が一から作る組織「マイクロソフト2.0」には、遠慮なく集団知やオープンソースの方法論がゲイツなりのやり方で吟味された後に取り込まれるだろう。そういう組織が戦略的な慈善事業を効率的に遂行するのだ。
今 、Web2.0バブルに浮かれている者のうち何人かは、ゲイツのように大金を稼いで、いつかそれを使う側に回る。その時はじめて、「しまった!ゲイツにしてやられた」と彼らは気がつくのだ。彼らの送る援助物資はゲイツの敷いた鉄道や道路で送られる。彼らが建てた学校にはゲイツによって命を救われた子供たちが通う。彼らの創設する財団は、全部ゲイツのそれから運営のノウハウを引き継ぐのだ。彼らは、自分がゲイツの手の平で踊らされていることに気がつくだろう。
もちろん、ゲイツと同じくらい負けず嫌いの彼らは、もっとよい金の使い道と使い方を工夫して、なんとかゲイツの上を行こうとするだろう。なんとかゲイツの見落した所から大きな穴を探して、ゲイツからも見放されていた人たちに援助の手を差しのべようとするだろう。
負けず嫌いのゲイツは、これから、そういう彼の未来の後継者と競争するのである。「後継者においしい所は残さない」それが、ゲイツの野心であり野望である。地球全体を見渡して、人類にとって真に有用な金の使い道を包括的に検討し、全くスキがなく間違いのない優先順位に従って、完璧な配分で金を使う。もちろん、ゲイツは彼の未来の後継者が自分と同じくらい頭がよいことを知っている。だから、ゲイツはこの競争がたいへんなものであること認識している。
でも、ゲイツは、未来の後継者に絶対に負けたくないだろう。どうしても、彼らがゲイツの後を追うしかないようにしたいだろう。ゲイツにとって慈善事業は、金持ちの道楽ではなくて命がけの真剣勝負なのだ。
これまで人類の歴史上で、こういうやり方で金が使われたことはない。これから「負けず嫌いの慈善」がどんな結果を起こすか楽しみである。
