Flight Ops clarification ......
A friend of mine who is a recreational pilot passed me this clipping from , I believe a flying magazine .
I do not know which one .
They however claim that they got it from a British Airways Flight Operations Department notice .
" There appears to be some confusion over the new pilot role titles .
This notice will hopefully clear up any misunderstandings .
The titles P1 , P2 and Co-Pilot will now cease to have any meaning , within the BA operations manuals .
They are to be replaced by Handling Pilot , Non-handling Pilot , Handling Landing Pilot , Non-Handling Landing Pilot , Handling Non-Landing Pilot , and Non Handling Non-Landing Pilot .
The Landing Pilot , is initially the Handling Pilot and will handle the take - off and landing except in role reversal when he is the Non-Handling Pilot for taxi Until the Handling Non-Landing Pilot , hands the Handling to the Landing Pilot at eighty knots .
The Non-Landing ( Non-Handling , since the Landing Pilot is Handling )
Pilot reads the checklist to the Handling Pilot until after the Before Descent Checklist completion , when the Handling Landing Pilot hands the handling to the Non-Handling Non-Landing Pilot who then becomes the Handling Non-Landing Pilot .
The Landing Pilot is the Non-Handling Pilot until the " decision altitude " call , when the Handling Non-Landing Pilot hands the handling to the Non-Handling Landing Pilot , unless the latter calls " go - around , " in which case the Handling Non-Landing Pilot , continues Handling and the Non-Handling Landing Pilot continues non-handling until the next call of " land " or " go - around , " as appropriate .
In view of the recent confusion over these rules , it was deemed necessary to restate them clearly . "
I hope that 's all quite clear now ....
Air Traffic Control
The following are accounts of actual exchanges between airliners and control towers from around the world : Tower : " Eastern 702 , cleared for takeoff , contact Departure on 124.7 . "
Eastern 702 : " Tower , Eastern 702 switching to Departure ... by the way , as we lifted off , we saw some kind of dead animal on the far end of the runway . "
Tower : " Continental 635 , cleared for takeoff , contact Departure on 124.7 ; did you copy the report from Eastern ? "
Continental 635 : " Continental 635 , cleared for takeoff and yes , we copied Eastern and we 've already notified our caterers . "
O'Hare Approach Control : " United 329 , traffic is a Fokker , one o'clock , 3 miles , eastbound . "
United 329 : " Approach , I 've always wanted to say this ... I 've got that Fokker in sight . "
N123 :  Youngstown Approach , Cessna 123 off Elser , request two practice ILS approaches , followed by the published missed to the VOR to hold , a VOR approach , two NDB approaches and an ASR approach . 
Approach :  Cessna 123 squawk 4573 , and would you like fries with that sir ? 
During the rush hour at Houstons Hobby Airport , a flight was delayed due to a mechanical problem .
Since they needed the gate for another flight , the aircraft was backed away from the gate while the maintenance crew worked on it .
The passengers were then told the new gate number , which was some distance away .
Everyone moved to the new gate , only to find that a third gate had been designated .
After some further shuffling , everyone got on board and as they were settling in , the flight attendant made the usual announcement :
 We apologise for the inconvenience of this last - minute gate change .
This flight is going to Washington DC .
If your destination is not Washington DC , then you should deplane at this time .
A very confused - looking and red- faced pilot emerged from the cockpit , carrying his bags .
 Sorry ,  he said , wrong plane .
For months after Californias Northridge earthquake of 1994 , aftershocks rocked the San Fernando Valley and Van Nuys Airport .
One morning , about three weeks after the initial quake , there was a particularly sharp aftershock .
Moments later on Van Nuys ground control frequency :  Uh , 43 K would like to file a pilot report for moderate turbulence on the east taxiway 
Many years ago I travelled by general aviation making business presentations to banks .
The presentation involved using a projector and folding screen .
Upon returning from one such flight , I went into the office to turn in the logbooks and pay for the Skylane I had rented .
The local hangers - flyers seemed to be looking me over suspiciously as I lugged my flight gear , logbooks , briefcase and the projector screen .
Realising that they thought I looked out of place , I glanced over my shoulder towards them and remarked ,  In - flight movies . 
A veteran airline Captain , apparently checking - in with air traffic control on the wrong frequency , was asked :  Say your position ?  to which he replied :  Captain . 
The traffic was heavy and the weary local controller had apparently heard all the blocked  and stepped on responses he could take when he made this transmission :
 How come every time I key my mic , some idiot starts talkin ? 
Approach :  Beech 998 , you re showing 2,000 feet and intermittent Mode C. Say altitude .
Beech :  Beech 998 is intermittently at 2,000 feet .
A student became lost during a solo cross-country flight .
While attempting to locate the aircraft on radar , air traffic control asked :  What was your last known position ? 
Student :  When I was No. 1 for take - off .  Student to Instructor :  You re simply impossible to satisfy .
I just finished navigating successfully through a boiling fluid , swirling around a rotating sphere that is hurtling around a fusion reaction source at thousands of miles an hour .
This system is moving in a circular motion around a black hole at who knows what speed , while the space it takes up is expanding .
And then I bounced the landing six inches .
SIX MEASLY INCHES !
Get off my freakin back !
Courtesy of Saturday Night Live :  The NTSB has determined that a frayed wire caused the spark that ignited vapours in the TWA 800 fuel tank .
The wire became frayed when it was hit by a missile 
At a recent software engineering management course in the US , the participants were given an awkward question to answer :
 If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software , how many of you would disembark immediately ? 
Among the forest of raised hands , only one man sat motionless .
When asked what he would do , he replied that he would be quite content to stay on board .
With his teams software , he said ,  the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway , let alone take off . 
The venerable Cessna 152 POH recommends testing the stall warning horn by placing a clean cloth over the stall vent and drawing a vacuum .
When an instructor asked a student at our club how to test the stall warning horn , he replied , place your mouth over the wing stall vent and suck hard till the siren goes off . 
The instructor then asked ,  What would you do if the vent was full of bugs and such ? 
The student pondered for a moment and then replied ,  Ask the instructor to place his mouth over the wing stall vent and suck hard till the siren goes off 
The student pilot was midway through the oral portion of his Private practical test .
After reviewing his pre-flight planning , the examiner pointed out that the Weight & Balance figures showed the airplane would be 50 lbs over max gross .
 What can you do about that ?  asked the examiner .
 First , I would have my passengers take off their clothes ,  suggested the applicant .
 If that were not enough , I d drain a gallon of oil from the engine .
Finally , Id remove 12 lbs of air from each tyre .
During a heavy traffic period , a pilot comes on Centre frequency , speaking in slow Texas drawl :  Good afternoon Houston Centre , King Air 12345 checkin with yall .
VFR at eighteen - five .
Long pause .
 Ah , King Air 12345 , sir , you cant be VFR at eighteen - five . 
S horter pause .
 Sure we can , Centre .
We re flyin a Super King Air ! 
Pilot :  Request a flight level betweel FL210 and FL250 . 
ATC :  Roger , you can have either 230 or 250 which would you like ?
Pilot :  Affirmative .
ATC :  Affirmative what ?
Pilot ;  Affirmative SIR ?
Overheard at OHare : Cessna 152 pilot with obvious French accent :  Centre , I would like a vector back home . 
Unidentified commuter pilot :  Heading , 090 , 2,000 miles .
Overworked air traffic controller responding to the disoriented student pilot of a single - engine Cessna calling on 121.5 MHz on a busy Saturday :  Lost aircraft , say position . 
Controller pointing out floatplane traffic to an IFR aircraft :  Traffic at your 2 oclock is a phone on plates . 

Overhead on the flightline at Oshkosh last weekend :
 Honey , you just have to stay for the B - 2 .
It s so stealthy that you re not going to see it when it goes by .
Heard on the frequency at BNA ( Nashville , TN . ) : Aircraft :  Hey , that altimeter setting we got put us 15 feet underground !
ATC :  Well , up - periscope and taxi to the ramp .
Anyone who has watched a group of pilots talking , understands this comment from a reader :  If God had intended man to fly , he would have equipped a chosen few with universal joints so they could talk about it .
I read today that the Boeing 777 has five million lines of computer code .

And for all you frequent airline flyers ......
1 . From a Southwest Airlines employee ....
" There may be 50 ways to leave your lover , but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane ... "
2 . Pilot -" Folks , we have reached our cruising altitude now , so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off .
Feel free to move about as you wish , but please stay in side the plane till we land ... it 's a bit cold outside , and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern . "
3 . After landing : " Thank you for flying Delta Business Express .
We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride . "
4 . As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National , a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker : " Whoa , big fella .
WHOA ! " 5 . After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis , a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced : " Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because , after a landing like that , sure as hell everything has shifted . "
6 . From a Southwest Airlines employee ....
" Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY .
To operate your seatbelt , insert the metal tab into the buckle , and pull tight .
It works just like every other seatbelt and if you do n't know how to operate one , you probably should n't be out in public unsupervised .
In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure , oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling .
Stop screaming , grab the mask , and pull it over your face .
If you have a small child travelling with you , secure your mask before assisting with theirs .
If you are travelling with two small children , decide now which one you love more .
7 . Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds , but they 'll try to have them fixed before we arrive .
Thank you , and remember , nobody loves you or your money , more than Southwest Airlines . "
8 . " Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing , please take them with our compliments . "
9 . " As you exit the plane , please make sure to gather all of your belongings .
Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants .
Please do not leave children or spouses . "
10 . " Last one off the plane must clean it . "
11 .
From the pilot during his welcome message : " We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry ... Unfortunately none of them are on this flight ...!
12 . Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo , Texas , on a particularly windy and bumpy day .
During the final approach , the Captain was really having to fight it .
After an extremely hard landing , the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced , " Ladies and Gentlemen , welcome to Amarillo .
Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what 's left of our airplane to the gate ! "
13 .
Another flight Attendant 's comment on a less than perfect landing : " We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal . "
14 .
An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard .
The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited , smile , and give them a " Thanks for flying XYZ airline . "
He said that in light of his bad landing , he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye , thinking that someone would have a smart comment .
Finally , everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane .
She said , " Sonny , mind if I ask you a question ? "
" Why no , Ma'am , " said the pilot , " what is it ? "
The little old lady said , " Did we land or were we shot down ? " 15 .
After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix , the Flight Attendant came on with , " Ladies and Gentlemen , please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate .
And , once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced , we 'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal . "
16 . Part of a Flight Attendant 's arrival announcement : " We 'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today .
And , the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurised metal tube , we hope you 'll think of us here at US Airways . "
17 After a particularly bad landing made from the right seat of a commercial airliner , the First Officer heard the Captain announce  Ladies and gentlemen , South West Airlines wishes to apologise for that rough landing provided today by our First Officer . 
Some months later , the same crew was together and , sure enough , the Captain made an even worse one .
The First Officer immediately jumped on the intercom , announcing ,  Ladies and gentlemen , South West Airlines wishes to apologise for that rough landing provided today by our Captain . 
The Captain turned angrily to his First Officer :  What did you say that for ? 
 Remember a couple of months back when you did that to me ?
 But I never keyed the mike ,  protested the Captain .
18 .
Taxiing down the tarmac , a DC - 10 abruptly stopped , turned around and returned to the gate .
After an hour - long wait , it finally took off .
A concerned passenger asked the flight attendant , " What , exactly , was the problem ? "
" The pilot was bothered by a noise he heard in the engine , " explained the flight attendant .
" It took us a while to find a new pilot . "
Stewardess 's public address to passengers Check THIS out - would n't you love to have this attendant on your next flight ?
Thanks to a retired Delta Captain for sending this " paraphrase " of a memorable safety PA from their Flight Attendants .
" ... Hello and welcome to Delta Flight 438 to San Francisco .
If you 're going to San Francisco , you 're in the right place .
If you 're not going to San Francisco , you 're about to have a really long evening .
We 'd like to tell you now about some important safety features of this aircraft .
The most important safety feature we have aboard this plane is ...
The Flight Attendants .
Please look at one now .
There are 5 exits aboard this plane : 2 at the front , 2 over the wings , and one out the plane 's rear end .
If you 're seated in one of the exit rows , please do not store your bags by your feet .
That would be a really bad idea .
Please take a moment and look around and find the nearest exit .
Count the rows of seats between you and the exit .
In the event that the need arises to find one , trust me , you 'll be glad you did .
We have pretty blinking lights on the floor that will blink in the direction of the exits .
White ones along the normal rows , and pretty red ones at the exit rows .
In the event of a loss of cabin pressure these baggy things will drop down over your head .
You stick it over your nose and mouth like the flight attendant is doing now .
The bag wo n't inflate , but there 's oxygen there , promise .
If you are sitting next to a small child , or someone who is acting like a small child , please do us all a favor and put on your mask first .
If you are traveling with two or more children , please take a moment now to decide which one is your favorite .
Help that one - first , and then work your way down .
In the seat pocket in front of you is a pamphlet about the safety features of this plane .
I usually use it as a fan when I 'm having my own personal summer .
It makes a very good fan .
It also has pretty pictures .
Please take it out and play with it now .
Please take a moment now to make sure your seat belts are fastened low and tight about your waist .
To fasten the belt , insert the metal tab into the buckle .
To release , it 's a pulley thing -- not a pushy thing like your car because you 're in an airplane -- HELLO !!
There is no smoking in the cabin on this flight .
There is also no smoking in the lavatories .
If we see smoke coming from the lavatories , we will assume you are on fire and put you out .
This is a free service we provide .
There are two smoking sections on this flight , one outside each wing exit .
We do have a movie in the smoking sections tonight ... hold on , let me check what it is ..
Oh here it is ; the movie tonight is Gone with the Wind .
In a moment we will be turning off the cabin lights , and it 's going to get really dark , really fast .
If you 're afraid of the dark , now would be a good time to reach up and press the yellow button .
The yellow button turns on your reading light .
Please do n't press the orange button unless you absolutely have to .
The orange button is your seat ejection button .
We 're glad to have you with us on board this flight .
Thank you for choosing Delta , and giving us your business and your money .
If there 's anything we can do to make you more comfortable , please do n't hesitate to ask .
If you all were n't strapped down you would have given me a standing ovation , would n't you ?
After landing ... Welcome to the San Francisco International Airport .
Sorry about the bumpy landing .
It 's not the captain 's fault .
It 's not the co-pilot 's fault .
It 's the Asphalt .
Please remain seated until the plane is parked at the gate .
At no time in history has a passenger beaten a plane to the gate .
So please do n't even try .
Please be careful opening the overhead bins because " shift happens . "

Metaclasses in Python 3.0 [ 2 of 2 ]
by Michele Simionato
August 9 , 2008
Classes are used to model sets of objects ; in the same sense , metaclasses are used to model sets of classes .
In order to show the power of metaclasses , we will define a set of record classes , all subclasses of a common mother class Record and all instances of the same metaclass MetaRecord , with a sum operator .
In mathematical term our set of classes will be a monoid , i.e. a set with an associative composition law ( the composition operator will be denoted with + ) and an identity , the base class Record .
Since Python tuples are already a monoid - the sum of two tuples is a tuple and the empty tuple works as an identity element - it makes sense to define our set of classes as a set of tuples .
The difference between ordinary tuples and the records we will define is that records have the concept of type : every given record field has a given type .
Since Python is dynamically typed the types will be specified in terms of casting functions , taking in input one or more types ( for instance integers and / or strings ) and returning a fixed type in output - or a TypeError if the if the input type is not acceptable .
We will consider the following casting functions for records of kind Book :
def varchar (n ) : " " " varchar ( n ) converts an object into a string with less than n characters or raises a TypeError " " " def check ( x ) : s = str(x ) if len(s ) > n : raise TypeError ( ' Entered a string longer than %d chars ' % n ) return s check .
__name__ = ' varchar ( %d ) ' % n return check
def date ( x ) : " Takes a string ( or date ) and converts it into a date " if isinstance( x , datetime.date ) : x = x.isoformat ( ) [ :10 ] return datetime.date ( * map( int , x.split ( ' - ' ) ) )
def score ( x ) : " Takes a string and converts it into an integer in the range 1 - 5 " if set ( x ) != {'*'} or len( x ) > 5 : raise TypeError ( ' %r is not a valid score ! ' % x ) return len(x )
varchar ( N ) makes sure that the string input is shorter than N characters ; for instance
>>> varchar ( 128 ) ( 'a ' * 129 ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : Entered a string longer than 128 chars
date makes sure that the string in input is a data in ISO format ; score converts a string with or or more stars into an integer number : the idea is that a book has a score in stars , for one to five .
>>> score ('***')
3
>>> score ( '')
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : '' is not a valid score !
We will define records like the following , where Record is a subclass of tuple enhanced with a suitable metaclass :
class Book ( Record ) : title_type = varchar ( 128 ) author_type = varchar ( 64 ) class PubDate ( Record ) : date_type = date class Score ( Record ) : score_type = score
On these records it will be possible to define a sum operator taking two or more classes and returning a new class :
>>> Book + PubDate + Score < class Book + PubDate +Score title: varchar( 128 ) , author : varchar ( 64 ) , date : date , score : score >
It will be possible to verify the associativity :
>>> ( Book + PubDate ) +
Score == Book + ( PubDate + Score ) True
and the existence of the identity element :
>>>
Book +
Record == Book True
>>>
Record +
Book == Book True
These properties at the class level correspond to analogous properties at the instance level .
Consider for instance the null record
>>> null = Record ( ) >>> null < Record >
a record ot type Book
>>> b = Book ( ' Putting Metaclasses to Work ' , ' Ira Forman ' ) >>> b < Book title=Putting Metaclasses to Work , author=Ira Forman >
and a record of type PubDate :
>>> d = PubDate ( ' 1998-10-01 ')
You can see that null is an identity :
>>> b + null == null + b == b True
Here is an example of sum of nontrivial records :
>>> s = b + d >>> s < Book + PubDate title=Putting Metaclasses to Work , author=Ira Forman , date=1998 - 10 -01 >
You can access the fields by name
>>> s.title , s.author , s.date ( ' Putting Metaclasses to Work ' , ' Ira Forman ' , datetime.date ( 1998 , 10 , 1 ) )
or by index
>>> s[ 0 ] , s [ 1 ] , s [ 2 ]
( ' Putting Metaclasses to Work ' , ' Ira Forman ' , datetime.date ( 1998 , 10 , 1 ) )
In a touchingly partisan recent essay titled “ Follow This Dime , ” progressive writer Thomas Frank indicts the federal government under Bush for its having cordially invited and lavishly rewarded corruption by conservative wheeler - dealers :
“ The ruination they have wrought has been thorough ; it has been a professional job . ”
I have no quarrel with Frank ’s characterization of the present federal government and its corporate cronies as utterly , shamelessly corrupt .
Yet , the touching part is the naïveté of Frank ’s interpretation and the conclusions he draws from his observations .
In perfect progressive pitch , he sings : “ We behold the majestic workings of the free market itself , boring ever deeper into the tissues of the state . ”
What he has identified , however , is not the free market , but the very antithesis of the free market ; it is classic economic fascism .
Because he has misdiagnosed the illness , he naturally prescribes a remedy that not only will fail to effect a cure , but will only cause the pathogen to penetrate more deeply into the state ’s tissues .
Having railed against the “ ruination they [ the conservative politicos and their corporate co-conspirators ] have wrought , ” he declares : “ Repairing it will require years of political action . ”
Fancy that : politicians are manifestly corrupt ; bring on more politicians to fix this mess .
Frank actually seems to buy into the quaint notion that once upon a time — before the present conservative ascendancy — government more or less “ served the people ” in the style touted by old - fashioned civics books such as the one he cites in his article .
He fails to appreciate that the federal government has been corrupt from time immemorial ; corruption is its raison d’être ; its very creation was the product of a corrupt counterrevolution mounted by men who sought to shackle the country with a stronger national government — the better to steer more booty to themselves and their political supporters .
After the conspirators unlocked the doors and opened the windows in Philadelphia , the ratification process in the states was not exactly squeaky clean , either .
The main difference between the federal government now and the federal government in the Good Old Days is that the present state is vastly larger in size , scope , and power , and therefore it possesses a great deal more to be corrupt with .
As readers with farm backgrounds will appreciate , huge heaps of fresh dung attract enormous swarms of flies .
I present you , ladies and gentlemen , with — voilà — Washington , D.C .
One of Frank ’s observations , however , does resonate strongly with me .
In remarking on corruption ’s pervasiveness in the capital city , he notes : “ The truth slaps your face in every hotel lobby in town . ”
I am especially struck by this remark because for many years I have been posing a challenge to those who raise questions about what they take to be my “ conspiracy theories ” of how Washington works .
My reply has long been : get thyself to any big Washington hotel early in the morning of a weekday ; sit down in the dining room and order a big breakfast ; and , then , for the next several hours , listen carefully to the conservations taking place at the surrounding tables .
I maintain that in a large number of cases these conversations will present every sign of being de facto conspiracies by special - interest representatives , their lobbyists , and their co-conspirators against the public interest .
That is to say , in many instances , these diners will turn out to be aspiring thieves who are plotting how best to bore into the Treasury and make off with boat - loads of the taxpayers ’ money .
Someone once said , I ’m not interested in conspiracy theories , I ’m interested in conspiracy facts .
I concur .
As for corruption , what is the capital city of a globe - girdling empire for if not for rampant corruption .
Notice further that the same city serves as the headquarters of a sprawling welfare / therapeutic / nanny / police state on the domestic front , and the possibilities are limitless .
If people were interested in behaving decently , they would never have constructed this monstrosity of a government in the first place , so we can scarcely pretend to be shocked when presented with evidence that sex acts are being committed in the whorehouse .
" The president [ George W. Bush ] is strongly motivated to string out the [ Iraq ] war until he leaves office , in order to avoid taking responsibility for the defeat he has caused and persisted in making greater each year for more than three years . "
General William Odom , former head of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) under President Ronald Reagan
" In beloved Iraq , blood is flowing between brothers , in the shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation , and abhorrent sectarianism threatens a civil war . "
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , March 29 , 2007
" After [ this ] war [ against Iraq ] has ended , the United States will have to rebuild much more than the country of Iraq .
We will have to rebuild America 's image around the globe . " -
Sen. Robert Byrd , ( D - W.Va ) , March 19 , 2003 .
T he Iraqi Parliament is on record as being against the US - led military occupation of their country .
Moreover , most Iraqis resent Americans occupying their country and the Bush - Cheney administration 's requests to do it forever by maintaining nearly 60 military bases in their country .
The Bush - Cheney administration has even threatened the puppet Iraqi government to withhold some $ 50 billion of Iraq 's money held as reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , if the Iraqi government does not sign what is also called a " strategic alliance " agreement to prolong U.S. occupation indefinitely and turn Iraq into a permanent American colony .
Indeed , after the illegal military invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , the United Nations was forced to extend a mandate of occupation to the United States .
Thus , in June 2004 , the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1546 that recognized the de facto occupation of Iraq by American - led military forces and kept Iraq subject to the Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter , which authorizes the use of force in Iraq .
The mandate was supposed to be terminated at the end of 2005 , but was extended .
It is that U.N. mandate authorizing an American presence in Iraq that finally expires on December 31 of this year .
After that date , there will be no legal basis for U.S. military forces to be on Iraqi soil and the Iraqi government would regain its entire authority .
That 's what the Bush - Cheney administration wants to avoid by pressing the Iraqis to sign a so - called long - term " security agreement " - , which would not require approval by the U.S. Congress ( because it would not be a treaty , although this is playing with words in order to escape the scrutiny of U.S. lawmakers ) , and which would keep real Iraqi authority to a nominal level and concentrate most of political power in American hands .
In other words , the Bush - Cheney administration wants a puppet government in Baghdad in perpetuity .
We may add that this is precisely what Republican presidential Candidate McCain also wants .
In the future , as now , Americans in Iraq ( American troops , contractors and private security guards ) would have full legal immunity for their actions , even when they steal , rape , kidnap , torture , or murder Iraqis , and could arrest Iraqis and put them in American - run jails .
Moreover , the American occupiers would have key Iraqi departments such as Defense , Interior and National Security ministries , as well as armament contracts , under their supervision for ten years , would keep control of Iraqi airspace , would maintain permanent military bases in the country and would retain the right to strike , from within Iraqi territory , any country ( read Iran and Syria ) they consider to be a threat to their security or contrary to U.S. or Iraqi interests .
Some sovereignty and some independence indeed !
Even the weak Nouri al - Maliki government thinks it 's too much , while Shia Grand Ayatollah al - Sistani is tinkering with the idea of issuing a religious fatwa against the Bush - Cheney 's so - called proposed agreement , a move that would likely kill it .
Let 's keep in mind that the Bush - Cheney 's military occupation of Iraq is doubly illegitimate , besides having been illegal from day one according to international law .
First , a solid majority of Americans want American soldiers out of Iraq .
Second , a vast majority of Iraqis also want American soldiers out of their country .
The irony is that the Bush - Cheney regime pretends to be in Iraq for the sake of " democracy " , while they trample on people 's demands both in Iraq and in the United States .
Some " democracy " indeed .
How about fascism and imperialism !
When both the president of Iraq and the King of Saudi Arabia say that the ongoing U.S. military occupation of Iraq is ' illegitimate ' , and when Turkey has acted on its threats to bomb and invade Northern Iraq , it becomes obvious that the entire Middle East is now turning against the U.S. Bush - Cheney regime and its colonial adventure in that part of the world .
The Bush - Cheney regime likes to delude itself and to play on words when it pretends that Iraq is not under an " illegitimate foreign occupation " but that U.S. troops are in that far away country at Iraq 's invitation ( sic ! ) , citing the after - the - fact U.N. mandate .
This is an example of fuzzy and circular thinking .
When you do n't think straight , you do n't act straight .
And , on this score , the Bush - Cheney administration is the most crooked you can find .
All that remains to see is whether the Bush - Cheney administration will succeed on three fronts , that is to say , 1 - force its puppet government in Baghdad to sign a long - term agreement of dependence toward the United States , 2 - bypass Congress and the U.S. Constitution in adopting what would clearly be an international treaty , and finally , 3 - tie up the hands of the next president and prevent him from withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq .
When you think of it , this is a cynical game of brinksmanship , always on the edge of legality , morality and decency .

COLUMBUS , Ohio —
A major voting machine maker has cautioned its customers in 34 states to look out for a programming error that may cause votes to be dropped .
At least 1,000 total votes were dropped in nine Ohio counties over the course of a handful elections back to 2006 , including the March presidential primary , though the error was in all cases discovered and corrected within several hours .
Premier Election Solutions Inc. previously had said complications with antivirus software caused the problem , but on Tuesday the company said in a product advisory that the problem is with the machines themselves .
The error occurs when multiple memory cards are being uploaded at the same time , and it is more likely to occur in jurisdictions that have several voters and use touch - screen voting systems , said Premier spokesman Chris Riggall .
Allen , Texas - based Premier , a unit of North Canton - based Diebold Inc. , supplies touch - screen voting systems as well as scanners for paper ballots .
The problem is more likely to occur in touch - screen systems because they use more memory cards , one for every touch screen .
Premier said in its product advisory that the problem can be corrected as long as officials monitor whether the memory cards are being uploaded , and if they are not , reload them until they are .
“ We are communicating to customers around the country , making sure that we ’re answering any questions concerning it , ” Riggall said .
In Ohio , the dropped votes were discovered within several hours by election officials who noticed the memory cards were n’t being read properly .
Workers re-fed the cards into the server until they worked , and the votes were added to the overall vote totals .
After Premier blamed the problem solely on antivirus software , officials in Ohio ’s Butler County kept testing the machines and claimed that there was a problem with the machines themselves .
That was later verified by Premier ’s own testing .
The company said the software can cause the error , but that the programming glitch can produce the error even when the software is n’t used .
Ohio will continue to use the Premier machines in the Nov. 4 election .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said identifying the cause of the problem will enable the state to prepare election officials to watch for the problem and correct it should it resurface .
“ We are finalizing plans that will walk board officials through the process of identifying the problem , loading the affected memory cards and verifying that the votes are counted , ” said Brunner spokesman Kevin Kidder .
The company and state election officials said there are multiple layers of security in place , such as post - election audits that match voting machine totals with a paper trail , that will ensure that no votes are missed .
Cuyahoga County , Ohio ’s largest county and the home of Cleveland , dropped Premier touch - screen systems in 2007 after the system malfunctioned .
The company sued the county for breach of contract .
Brunner then countersued , citing the dropped votes that the company acknowledged in its letter to Brunner this week .
Premier spokesman Riggall said he could not comment on the lawsuit .
The civil rights division of the Justice Department , which is responsible for enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws , has been accused in a recent lawsuit of discriminating against its own employees based on race .
A 13 - year veteran of the division brought the suit , alleging she was " repeatedly denied the opportunity to apply and compete " for promotions because she is black .
Joi Hyatte , who works as an equal opportunity assistant in the division 's voting rights section , claims that superiors subjected her and " African - American colleagues to numerous forms of discrimination and harassment , " according to the suit filed May 29 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
" I saw the hiring process being abused , " Hyatte said in a recent interview with ProPublica .
" I just want a fair chance to compete , but I was kept out . "
Black and white employees in the voting section have independently supported Hyatte 's claims .
The suit alleges that several administrative employees have filed racial discrimination complaints against the section 's managers , which the Justice Department failed to investigate .
" It 's deeply disturbing that the DOJ division designed to fight injustice would allow this repeated discrimination , " said Hyatte 's attorney , Kathryn Sabbeth , of the Georgetown University Institute for Public Representation .
DOJ spokesman , Charles Miller , refused to comment on Hyatte 's suit .
" Our response will come in court , " he said .
The suit comes at an uneasy time for the civil rights division .
An internal Justice Department report released last week revealed that the division illegally used " political or ideological " factors to hire law school graduates with conservative credentials over applicants with " liberal affiliations . "
Soon , the DOJ 's inspector general will release a follow - up report on the division 's hiring decisions .
And the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) is investigating how the division decides which anti-discrimination cases to pursue , though the GAO recently complained that the Justice Department has stonewalled that probe .
Hyatte 's complaints , meanwhile , are aimed at two lightning rods of DOJ controversy : John Tanner , ex-voting section chief , and Yvette Rivera , former acting deputy chief of the voting department known as section 5 .
Tanner , who worked in the voting section for more than 30 years , resigned from the civil rights division last year after making racially inflammatory comments that caused a political uproar .
Last year , at the National Latino Congreso in Los Angeles , he said that voter photo identification laws primarily affect elderly people and are less likely to affect minorities because , " Minorities do n't become elderly the way white people do :
They die first . "
The day before , he told the Georgia NAACP that poor people are likely to have photo identification because check - cashing businesses require it .
Several congressional Democrats , including presumed presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama ( Ill. ) , called for Tanner to be removed .
In Dec. 2007 , he resigned from the division and briefly moved to another position in the Justice Department .
He is now at the Alabama Law Institute .
Tanner refused to comment on Hyatte 's suit or any Justice Department matter .
" As soon as I hear from [ the DOJ ]
I 'll know how I 'm supposed to respond , " he said .
Hyatte alleges that , under Tanner and Rivera , the division invoked race in hiring its civil rights analysts - the higher - paying position she has sought since 2006 .
Hyatte has n't been promoted since 1999 , despite taking on the duties of an analyst and receiving an " outstanding , " the highest possible rating , on her two most recent performance evaluations .
According to DOJ personnel files reviewed by ProPublica , Rivera altered Hyatte 's 2005 - 2006 evaluation after a supervisor awarded Hyatte high marks .
" Ms. Hyatte is always courteous , polite , cooperative , and professional , " supervisor Natalie Govan 's review said .
Rivera substituted the word " usually " for " always " and added that Hyatte should work " more openly with her managers . "
Rivera instructed Govan , who is black , to downgrade the performance evaluations of other black employees , the suit alleges .
Attempts to reach Govan were unsuccessful .
The suit also said Rivera did n't announce available jobs to Hyatte and other civil rights division employees , a violation of DOJ policy .
Instead , the division " actively recruited and hired only white and Hispanic candidates from outside the government , " including people unqualified for the analyst position , the suit said .
Hyatte also alleged that Rivera withheld performance awards , including cash bonuses , from the division 's 12 black employees in 2007 .
Hyatte said Rivera supervised about two dozen people and six were given awards .
Rivera , who transferred to another voting section position earlier this year , did not return phone calls seeking comment .
As for Tanner 's role , he too " demonstrated hostility towards African - American employees , " the suit said .
Additionally , Hyatte 's complaint said Tanner failed to discipline three white male lawyers who , in Feb .
2007 , " behaved in a racially and sexually offensive manner " toward two female employees -- one white , the other black .
" The attorneys mocked the Caucasian analyst for displaying pictures of prominent African - American civil rights activists and leaders on the walls of her office " and referred to both women as ' lesbians . '
" That was unacceptable to us , " Hyatte said .
Now that Tanner has resigned , and Rivera has switched positions , Hyatte said conditions have improved in Section 5 .
Still , Hyatte is requesting that a judge order she receive a promotion and back pay since July 2006 , when she assumed additional work without a pay raise .
" I know I 'm qualified , " Hyatte said .
" I earned the right to compete for these positions like everyone else . "

Separately we would like to give our thanks to our publisher 's editor Peter Lavery for all his help .
CONTENTS
The premise of our work is that every baby needs to feel love and happiness .
A baby will bond these instinctive feelings to whatever people and situations are available .
It is the birth - right of every child to be surrounded by nurturing and loving parents in an atmosphere of peace .
In a non-violent family , a child grows up in such an atmosphere , and then , working from the secure base of being loved , will develop an independent and choosing self that is able to recreate happy love both in future relationships and with its own children .
In a violent family , however , this birthright to love and peace is betrayed , because from the moment of conception the child lives in a world where emotional and physical pain and danger are always present .
The child then bonds to pain .
This bonding becomes an addiction to pain .
The child then cannot grow to form an independent self , because he or she is slave to this addiction .
Throughout life , the person then recreates situations of violence and pain , for those situations stir the only feelings of love and satisfaction the person has ever known .
Whether the children of violent families learn to find satisfaction through the inflicting or the receiving of emotional and physical pain , the violence that these people live on is merely an expression of pain .
The role of the caring community is to undo this fundamental betrayal of people who have been emotionally disabled by their violent childhoods .
By creating a loving environment in which deep internal work can be done to help violence - prone people to understand and to overcome their addiction to pain , these people can then learn to trust and be happy in love instead of pain .

This book records ten years of work in such a community , along with the techniques and insights gained through these years .
The work now continues in Britain through Women 's Aid Ltd. , which runs a house in Bristol .

The idea of a meeting place for women and their children grew out of my disastrous brush with a local group of the newly emergent Women 's Movement in 1971 .
I was then feeling lonely and isolated , with two small children to care for , and a husband frequently away .
When I first began to read the articles that other women were writing , I felt they were writing about me .
It was certainly a liberation to find I was not the only woman who could not knit or sew , and that there were other women out there who shared my pathological hatred of housework .
I began to look out for our nearest group .
Unfortunately that group , in particular , seemed to be more concerned with world politics than with my day - to4ay problems , like how to cope on my own with two children , two dogs and a cat - for the loneliness was sometimes dreadful .
Luckily I did meet some women like myself who wanted not only to bring up their children properly at home , but also to use their energies and talents in improving our community life , so that we would no longer feel so cut off and isolated that we lived our lives on valium .
Therefore we left it to the women 's group to decide the solution for world problems , and got on with the more immediate task of finding a place where mothers could meet each other and bring their children .
So with two of my friends I began to scout round Hounslow for a little house to use as a women 's centre .
Eventually Hounslow Council wrote to me about No.2 Belmont Terrace , and I collected the keys .
When I first opened the door , I burst into tears - it was derelict .
But it was ours !
By now our group had grown quite large , and we
9
determinedly got on with the work .
Harry Ferrer , our plumber , showed us how to fit pipes and mend washers , and we completely renovated the building until one day it was ready for occupation .
Mothers living locally began to call by on their way to and from school .
They would stop in for a chat or to share a problem with us .
Gradually we all pooled our knowledge and began to learn the complex Social Security laws .
We discovered that many women would come to see us who could not face anything as authoritarian - seeming as a town - hall or a Social Services department .
We had created a very happy little community of people from all walks of life , who knew that any time they were lonely or in need of company they just had to go down to No.2 Belmont Terrace , and someone was almost sure to be there to talk to .
And even when no one was there , it was still a warm , welcoming place to take your kids .
Then home did not seem so much like a prison .
All this changed the day the first battered woman walked through the front door and showed me her bruises .
' No one will help me , ' she said .
Those words took me back to a time in my own childhood when no one would help me - as I begged them to bury my mother because my father refused to .
' I will help you , ' I promised her , and refuge was born .
Within weeks there were at least forty mothers and children packed into four tiny rooms .
Fortunately for me , our predicament was high - lighted in a small piece written by a journalist for the Observer .
After that a man called by one day and , sitting himself down on a mattress , asked me what I most needed .
' A new house , ' I told him .
' Go and find it , ' he said .
I did .
This man was Neville Vincent , the Managing Director of Bovis Ltd .
In November 1974 we acquired a much larger house in Chiswick High Road .
However , we were still not out of the woods .
Even as we moved in , our numbers were already too great .
We were still officially overcrowded .
Because at that time there was nowhere else for women to run to , I insisted that no one should ever be turned away .
As a result , although we were legally allowed to house only thirty - six residents , our numbers sometimes went as high as one hundred and fifty mothers and children .
My colleague Anne Ashby agreed with me over the ' open door '
10
principle , and we enshrined it in our policy that the door would remain open day and night .
This , of course , created an unbearable tension between ourselves and our local Borough , who quite rightly were worried by the overcrowding , the ensuing health hazard , and the possibility of fire .
On 29 April 1976 the Borough first took me to court for overcrowding .
Just before I was to appear in the Acton Magistrates ' Court , I was invited to tour America with Tina , Nikki , and Annie , who were working with me at the time .
I was genuinely startled and moved that anyone should consider that we had anything valuable to offer , so I accepted at once .
We flew into New York on 12 March 1976 , and visited sixteen other cities to raise funds for new refuges springing up all over the USA .
I remember that I was particularly interested in finding if anyone else had come to similar conclusions on why some people actually choose violent relationships - which is the major theme of this book .
But in response I mostly met again the hostility of those people who insisted that all women were simply victims of male oppression .
It seems to me that America 's Women 's Movement is much more broadly based than its British counterpart .
It was with members of the National Organization of Women that we had the best dialogues - at seminars and meetings where people wanted to share a sense of bewilderment arising from the fact that now there were established refuges , so many women seemed to be merely using them like revolving doors .
They would come to the refuges when the level of violence got too much , only to return to their violent men for another few weeks , and then come back to the refuges again for help .
Some of the refuges dealt with this problem by allowing such women three visits only .
As they explained to me , this rule meant that the staff could concentrate their efforts on the women who genuinely wanted to get out of violent relation - ships .
But they knew , just as we did , that if you wanted to do effective work in a refuge , the problems attached to women who seemed unable to stay away from violence would have to be fully explored sooner or later .
Our trip ended with a lunch of honour in Washington DC ,

sponsored by Congresswoman Lindy Boggs and Congressman Newton Steer .
As I stood to give my speech in a lovely room surrounded by members of Congress on Capitol Hill , it was bard not to feel bitter that back home , within a few weeks , I would be facing charges in an English court for carrying out the refuge work I was now describing to a supportive audience .
Thanks to a brilliant manoeuvre on the part of our barrister Stephen Sedly and David Ormondy , a public health adviser , the Acton Magistrates '
Court found me not guilty of overcrowding .
The good news was followed immediately by bad news .
Hounslow appealed , and got ready to take me to the High Court in the Strand .
During this time , through a series of fortuitous events , we managed to persuade the reluctant civil servants to give us a grant of £ 2,000 a month .
This generosity could have had something to do with the threat of our group arranging a sit - in outside 10 Downing Street .
We numbered about one hundred and twenty mothers and children , and we were already well known for our immediate ability to get on the streets with our placards and demand action where necessary .
We had received a reassuring letter saying that our application for a grant would be considered .
However , we heard nothing for several months , and it was not until October 1974 , the day before the publication of my book Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear , that a cheque arrived by taxi , with a letter from the Department of Health and Social Security .
Meanwhile , during the Conservatives ' period in office , I had been encouraged by Sir Keith Joseph to apply for an Urban Aid Grant of £ 10,000 a year .
The Urban Aid scheme was a very new idea in those days .
Hounslow had many other schemes to put forward to the Government , but due to local pressure and the continued support of a local Labour councillor , Jim Duffy , they did put my scheme in .
To their surprise and my amusement , it was granted .
By this time , help came from another direction .
David Astor had resigned from the Observer and offered me his services .
He brought with him the kindly and powerful figure of Lord Goodman .
Now , at least , Anne Ashby and I were no longer on our own .
12
We had a curious mixture of dedicated staff and volunteers .
We scoured London , taking possession of empty houses belonging to other boroughs which refused to take financial responsibility for their own families , who turned up on our doorstep .
We took these houses over by night , to create new communities for such additional families .
By the time of the court cases , Chiswick Women 's Aid had established twenty - two squats , and had also acquired the Palm Court Hotel ( forty - five private suites ) , three Greater London Council properties , and a large vicarage in Bristol .
Even so , at our main refuge we had to erect large garden sheds in the backyard to cope with the overflow of one hundred and fifty mothers and children living in the house .
As the case in the High Court approached , the battle lines were set , but I was no longer powerless , or fighting in a vacuum .
We had Lord Gordon on our side , and I felt very much more confident .
In the late spring of 1976 , Hounslow took me to the High Court , where I was found guilty of the charge of overcrowding .
We appealed this decision , and the matter went to the House of Lords in March 1977 .
There the five Law Lords reluctantly found me guilty , and I returned to Acton Magistrates ' Court for sentencing .
During this time , and responding to so much publicity , other groups had formed to take up the idea of refuge for women and children .
Many comprised good , loving people , both men and women , who sincerely wanted to help , but there were also the usual faces seen around all social movements , and I was wary enough to stay clear of their politics .
I never saw Women 's Aid as a movement that was hostile to men , but The National Federation , which quickly formed , made it quite clear that men were the enemy .
This view totally rejected our own philosophy - which cannot be encapsulated in a political theory , but which recognises that the basis of the problem is a human one : violence occurs in both men and women .
That is not a politically fashionable view in certain quarters , and , indeed , for them we were outcasts from the very beginning because we had always employed male workers at our Refuge - and we also ran a special house for the men of the problem families who sought our help .
13
The civil servants , who hated our open - door policy as much as they hated our evidence of the mistreatment of problem families by the various State - run agencies saw their opportunity to get rid of us .
They removed our grant on the grounds that we were not a national organisation , even though we had been officially declared so by the Charity Commissioners and our mothers and children came from all over Britain .
They handed the grant to the National Federation instead .
At about the same time , Hounslow Council voted to remove our Urban Aid Grant , thus hoping to starve us into submission .
Fortunately , they did not know that I had been given a sum of £ 50,000 by an anonymous well - wisher , which I had tucked away in bonds for just such an occasion .
Those staff that could afford to all gave up their meagre salaries .
Most of us were volunteers , so that presented little problem , and we soldiered on .
The final court case was my sentencing at the Acton Magistrates ' Court on 6 October 1977 .
The following February , in response to a letter from one of our mothers , the Queen intervened and saved the Refuge . *
The war was over , and the rest is history .
This book is not about the politics of survival for pressure groups , because that is a whole book in itself .
This book is about the problem families and my ( and later Jeff 's ) work with them .
Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear is about how people are violent .
Infernal Child , my autobiography , is about how a violent childhood affects children .
Prone to Violence is a book about why people are violent .
In these pages we can all recognise parts of ourselves , and hopefully , in gaining understanding , we can learn compassion , and in turn help to persuade our society to refrain from further brutalising already brutalised people .
* The Court sentencing and the letter from Buckingham Palace ( quoted in full ) are described in Chapter Five .

All state pupils may be taught Islamic traditions as part of compulsory citizenship lessons
Hazel Blears : ' We wo n't dictate on matters of faith '
State school pupils are set to be taught Islamic traditions and values in compulsory citizenship lessons .
The move - part of a package of initiatives announced by Communities Secretary Hazel Blears yesterday - is designed to curb extremism .
Education campaigners warned however against giving Islam a privileged position over other faiths .
Other plans announced by Miss Blears also drew criticism - including a state - funded panel of Islamic scholars and theologians to provide community leadership .
Prominent Muslims said this scheme was naive because Government endorsement would erode the credibility of those taking part , especially among the young and disaffected .
Another measure will see Muslim children being taught citizenship lessons by imams in mosque schools - in the hope that they will be better equipped to resist extremist messages .
Many Muslim youngsters in the UK attend evening classes at madrassah schools attached to mosques , where imams give instruction in the Koran and Islamic history .
Ministers want imams to stress that the Koran places a duty on all Muslims to be good neighbours , carry out voluntary work and play an active part in civic society .
Pilot schemes will begin in October in London , Leicester , Birmingham , Oldham , Rochdale , and Bradford .
The Department for Communities and Local Government has tasked the Islam & Citizenship Education group with producing the teaching materials for mosques .
The organisation , however , wants to extend its remit to mainstream state schools by ' teaching Islamic traditions and values in the school citizenship curriculum ' .
David Conway , senior research fellow at the Civitas think - tank , said : ' Some will see this as another sign of a creeping process of Islamisation - an insidious process which plays down the Christian basis of our culture and encourages children to learn more and more about Islam 's contribution .
' Muslims are still a relatively small minority in Britain and , while I have nothing against children in our multi-religious society learning about each other 's faiths , for one particular faith to be privileged in mainstream schools seems to me pointless , and wo n't make for greater harmony .
' I fear it will play into the hands of the small minority who want to see the Islamisation of Europe , and believe they will triumph through sheer numbers . '
Unlike religious education classes , citizenship lessons , which do not cover issues of belief , are compulsory .
Nick Seaton , chairman of the Campaign for Real Education , said : ' We should not single out one particular faith .
Citizenship is supposed to be secular .
' Children can learn about particular religious values in religious education lessons .
That 's why parents have the right to withdraw .
It 's a very different matter to promote a particular faith 's values as part of compulsory citizenship lessons .
' It seems to me dangerous to single out the one faith which is probably linked to the most problems with terrorism at the moment for special treatment . '
Khalid Mahmood , project manager of Islam & Citizenship Education , stressed that the project was at a very early stage .
He said : ' The material is being developed for the madrassahs but we are putting it together so that people in mainstream schools would also be able to use it . '
Miss Blears announced details of the panel of 20 leading Muslim experts which will have £ 100,000 in state funding .
Based at Cambridge University , the experts will be expected to compile reports on key issues in the lives of British Muslims , such as the wearing of Islamic veils by women .
Miss Blears insisted the new panel would be independent , adding : ' It is not for Government to dictate on matters of faith or religious teaching . '
Dr Azzam Tamimi , of the Institute of Islamic Political Thought in London , said the scheme was doomed to failure .
He said : ' This is a naive initiative .
This not how Muslim education or awareness works .
' When a Muslim individual seeks advice or knowledge he or she would usually go to a person they consider to be credible or an authority , and usually Muslims are suspicious of government - sponsored or organised commissions . '
Dr Tamimi told BBC Radio 4 's Today Programme ministers were trying to dictate to Muslims over religious awareness and education .
US exploits Georgia crisis to push through Polish missile deal
By Stefan Steinberg
21 August 2008
The agreement signed Wednesday by the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski to establish a missile defence shield on Polish soil marks a major turning point in international political relations .
The deal permits the US to set up a new missile system in the heart of Europe .
In addition , Poland will receive 96 Patriot missiles , a permanent garrison of American troops and , most significantly , Washington ’s commitment to come to the country ’s defence , independently of the NATO alliance .
From its inception , the US government has insisted that the proposal to set up a missile defence system in Eastern Europe was strictly of a defensive character .
The circumstances under which the deal was rushed through last week — after 18 months of intense negotiations between Washington and Warsaw — only serves to confirm the opposite : the missile system is of an offensive character and is designed for use against Russia .
The pact signed by Rice and Sikorski dramatically increases the possibility of a confrontation between the two nations with the world ’s biggest arsenals of nuclear weapons — Russia and the US — with central Europe as a primary battlefield .
Both Warsaw and Washington have sought to deny that the closing of the deal last week was bound up with the conflict between Georgia and Russia .
Following its finalisation last Thursday , the chief US negotiator , John Rood , told the press : “ This is not linked to the situation in Georgia ” .
In Washington , White House spokesperson Dana Perino assured journalists that the timing of the deal was not meant to further antagonise Russia .
“ In no way is the president ’s plan for missile defence aimed at Russia , ” she said .
“ The purpose of missile defence is to protect our European allies from any rogue threats . ”
Just before signing the missile deal , Rice reiterated that the system was designed to counter threats from Iran and North Korea and told reporters :
“ It is not aimed in any way at Russia . ”
Following the signing of the agreement on Wednesday , Polish President Lech Kaczynski again declared that the missile shield was of purely a defensive system and not a threat to its neighbours .
None of these claims are credible .
The deal was reached between the Polish and US governments last Thursday , just days after the outbreak of hostilities in Georgia and on the heels of a concerted anti-Russian campaign led by the Polish President Lech Kaczynski .
Just two days before the finalisation of the missile pact , Kaczynski appeared alongside Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili at an anti-Russian rally in Tbilisi to proclaim , “ We are here to take up the fight ( against Russia ) . ”
For its part , the conservative Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza , which welcomes the missile system , pointed candidly to the direct link between the deal and the conflict in the Caucasus : “ Contrary to the official version presented by Prime Minister Tusk and the US State Department , the war in Georgia played a key role in accelerating the Polish - American negotiations on the defence shield .
It is the war that has prompted Tusk to give the go - ahead for the signing of the agreement . ”
In fact , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has himself made it clear that the US pledge to back Warsaw in the event of Russian aggression was decisive in winning Polish acceptance of the deal .
Tusk declared that he only agreed to host the US defence shield on the condition that the US augment Poland ’s defences with Patriot missiles , which are intended to combat any threat from Russia .
At one time touted as possible alternatives to the rabidly nationalist Polish President Kaczynski , Prime Minister Tusk and Foreign Minister Sikorski have revealed themselves to be politicians of the same stripe .
The American State Department has always insisted that the 10 interceptor missiles that are to be installed at a base in Poland , just 115 miles from Russia ’s westernmost frontier , are aimed at countering potential missile attacks from so called “ rogue states ” such as Iran and North Korea .
Washington has already reached an agreement with Prague to place the second component of the missile defence shield , a radar tracking system , in the Czech Republic to Poland ’s south - west .
US claims that the missiles system is directed at Iran were recently debunked in an article published in the Blätter für deutsche and internationale Politik , Germany ’s most widely read political and foreign policy journal .
In a section of his essay entitled “ The strategic logic of the missile shield , ” author Hauke Ritz stresses that the stationing of the system in Poland and the Czech Republic “ is not at all designed to intercept Iranian missiles ” .
Ritz points out that the Iranian military lacks any missiles with a range capable of reaching Europe and that it would require a long period of time to develop and build them .
He also notes that the US State Department ruled out a Russian proposal for setting up a joint US - Russian anti-missile system in Azerbaijan , which could intercept and destroy any Iranian missile at the start of its flight path .
The author concludes : “ The fact that the US ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion : that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against Iran , but against Russia .
This is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to Russia , for example Alaska . ”
In describing the role of the missile system , the article establishes that it is intended not as a deterrent against nuclear attack — along the lines of the Cold War build - up of a system of “ mutually assured destruction ” ( MAD ) - but rather as an essential component of a US first - strike strategy .
“ The strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles Moscow is capable of launching following an American first strike , ” Ritz writes .
“ The missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against Russia .
The original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in Poland .
But once the system is established , their number could be easily increased . ”
Finally , the author refers to an article in the US magazine Foreign Affairs in 2006 entitled “ The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy , ” which argues that the US currently has unique advantages in conducting nuclear war .
Ritz concludes : “ This article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system : it is to guarantee the US the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter - strike .
If this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument , in order to implement national interests . ”
Ritz ’s analysis of the missile shield system as an essential component of a first - strike strategy underscores the enormous and growing danger that the escalating conflict between the US and Russia could unleash a nuclear conflagration .
Leading Russian military figures and politicians have reacted furiously to the missile shield agreement .
Last Friday , General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , the Russian armed forces ’ deputy chief of staff , described the pact as an act of aggression against Russia and warned Poland that it was leaving itself open to retaliation — and possibly even a nuclear attack .
“ Poland , by deploying [ the system ] is exposing itself to a strike — 100 per cent , ” he said .
In his talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last Friday , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev repeated the charge that the Polish missile deployment “ has the Russian Federation as its target ” .
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s , Washington has followed a policy of systematically encroaching on former Soviet territory to establish a string of military bases and governments friendly to the US .
The purpose of this policy was to undermine the influence of Russia in the energy - rich regions of central Asia , while seeking to divide and weaken Europe .
The consequences of Washington ’s intervention in the former Soviet bloc have included the installation of a number of authoritarian regimes which lack any genuine broad popular base such as those of Mikheil Saakashvili in Georgia and Viktor Yushchenko in the Ukraine , as well as the regime in Poland .
The most common characteristics of these administrations are rabid anti-communism , national chauvinism , contempt for genuine democratic processes and an unwavering adherence to the precepts of the free market .
Such regimes are inherently unstable , both internally and in relation to their neighbours .
Now , the US administration has agreed to install a new weapons system in Poland directed against its biggest neighbour , while at the same time guaranteeing to come to the military assistance of the Polish government when necessary .
This is a recipe for new conflict and war .
Nothing could more clearly express the utter recklessness of US foreign policy .
The dramatic increase of tensions in Eastern Europe eerily recalls the build up to the Second World War .
Throughout the 1930s , the German dictator Adolf Hitler professed his peaceful intentions while at the same time undertaking a series of provocations as part of his plan to fundamentally redraw the map of Europe in Germany ’s interests .
It was precisely in Poland where a global war that would claim over 70 million lives broke out in September 1939 .
Prior to leaving for Brussels for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday , the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , wagged her finger and warned that Russia was playing a “ dangerous game ” in Georgia .
The US and its NATO allies would not allow Russia to draw a “ new line ” through Europe , she declared .
Then , following the summit on Tuesday , Rice returned to the theme and declared with reference to Russia ’s military presence in Georgia that there would not be a new line between “ those who want to be within and those outside the Atlantic structure . ”
Such comments are utterly hypocritical .
Russia ’s intervention over the past two decades in the states of the former Soviet Union - as in its brutal war in Chechnya — have been of a reactionary character and should be condemned , but there cannot be the least doubt that the main power intent on establishing new power blocs and spheres of influence in the region is the US .
This is the significance of the network of military bases and installations established in Eastern and Central Europe by successive US administrations since 1991 with the aim of encircling Russia .
Moreover , it was Rice ’s colleague , former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , who in 2003 sought to draw a dividing line between “ old ” and “ new ” Europe , on the basis of which European countries were prepared to support the US in its war against Iraq .
Now in its missile deal with Poland , it is the US which has agreed to a clause that subverts the traditional structures of the NATO alliance in order to further Washington ’s unilateral militarist policy in the region .
The increasingly aggressive penetration of the US into central and eastern Europe is causing alarm in Paris , Berlin and Rome .
At the same time , Washington is only able to press ahead with its reckless offensive because of the cowardly stance adopted by the European bourgeoisie , which watches as tensions on the continent escalate to boiling point , but is not prepared to challenge the US administration .
President Bush wo n't be arrested for war crimes when he arrives in the Twin Cities for the Republican National Convention in September .
Former Minneapolis City Council member and activist Ed Felien lost his bid to compel the Hennepin County attorney to investigate Bush for war crimes .
Hennepin County District Court Judge Gary Larson issued an eight - page order Thursday rejecting Felien 's push to have Bush arrested .
Larson said issuing an order to arrest the president would violate the state constitution 's separation of powers doctrine .
In late May , Felien argued before Larson that Bush should be investigated and prosecuted for murder because of troop deaths in Iraq , conspiring with the Saudi Arabian royal family to raise oil prices for personal gain , and conspiracy to distribute drugs by controlling the opium trade in Afghanistan .
Felien had written to the Hennepin County attorney several times asking that he arrest Bush .
The county attorney acted within his discretion not to file charges against Bush , Larson wrote .
" It is therefore not within the authority , nor the prudent discretion , of this court to force the filing of criminal charges that the county attorney does not deem warranted , " he wrote .
Larson said the court must defer to a prosecutor 's discretion to evaluate and charge cases .
" Judicial interference should be rare and occur only when an injustice results because the prosecutor has clearly abused her discretion in exercising the charging function , " Larson wrote .
Deputy Hennepin County Attorney Patrick Diamond argued in court that the notion that the president could be taken into custody and prosecuted was " highly doubtful . "
Felien was publisher of the now - defunct Pulse , a weekly alternative newspaper .
He still publishes South Side Pride , three separate monthly newspapers in south Minneapolis .
He said the ruling was " terrible " and said he may file a similar request in Ramsey County .
The tentacle - like growth of clandestine advertising in American TV shows in the form of product placement has taken another controversial step with the introduction of McDonald 's products into regional news programmes .
Several TV outlets have begun to sell the fast - food giant the right to place cups of its iced coffee on to the desks of news anchors as they present morning current affairs shows .
Typical is Fox 5 News in Las Vegas , an affiliate of Rupert Murdoch 's Fox television network .
Two cups of coffee , their cubes of ice glinting in the studio lights , now daily stand before the channel 's morning presenters .
The presenters conspicuously do not drink from the cups , which is just as well - the cups contain a bogus fluid and fake ice to prevent the cubes melting .
The New York Times has reported that similar deals to place McDonald 's products in news shows are up and running in TV stations in Chicago , Seattle and New York .
Product placement has become a huge branch of advertising in the US , creeping into all areas of entertainment television .
Not only are products seen on camera , they also make their way into drama scripts , such as an episode of the popular soap , The OC , which had one character talk about having " a9.com 'd " a friend on the day the internet search company A9 launched a Yellow Pages service of the same name .
Advertising and broadcasting content have become increasingly blurred , with new reality TV show , What I Like About You , pitting young women against each other to compete for an acting slot on an advert for Herbal Essences .
The ad is then broadcast in a break during the show .
This is the first time product placement has percolated through to news broadcasts .
Journalism ethics groups have protested it is another erosion of standards .
" There has been in broadcast journalism certainly , and arguably in all journalism , a drifting away from the standards of straight news in the direction of entertainment , " said Roy Peter Clark of the school for journalists , the Poynter Institute .
Fox 5
News has declined to reveal how much it is being paid by McDonald 's for the six - month promotion .
The station 's news director , Adam Bradshaw , said that the product placement was only allowed in programmes that were appropriate , including later morning shows with an accent on lifestyle .
" I would not put it on a straight newscast like my 5 or 10 pm news , " Bradshaw said .
The other potential difficulty with the new trend in TV news was conflict of interest .
Bradshaw said the McDonald 's deal would in no way impede the station broadcasting negative news concerning the food chain .
" News is news .
Sales is sales .
If there 's a story about McDonald 's we would report on it just like anyone else , " he said .
He added that in such cases he would remove the coffee cups from the newscasters ' desks , in a similar way to the pulling of adverts for airline companies during newscasts that report an air crash .
TV stations across America are suffering from a downturn in advertising , partly due to the challenge of the internet and partly due to the country 's more recent economic troubles .
In a harsh financial climate , many are turning to new cash streams , such as Fox 5 News 's latest innovation .
LAS VEGAS – Reporters covering the Black Hat Security Conference this week were allegedly hacked by three French reporters .
The three reporters are believed to have sniffed a private network that other reporters at the conference were using – an apparent violation of the federal wiretap statute .
A Black
Hat spokeswoman explained that the three reporters gathered log - in data for reporters in the Black Hat press room and tried to convince organizers of the Wall of Sheep to post the data publicly .
The Wall of Sheep is a traditional feature at the DefCon hacker conference ( which begins tomorrow in Las Vegas ) but was launched at Black Hat for the first time this year .
The Wall of Sheep is designed to shame conference attendees who do n't connect to the internet using secure methods .
The Wall of Sheep organizers sniff the wireless network to grab log - in information that 's sent in the clear , then display it in redacted form on a wall for everyone to see .
( See image at right of Wall of Sheep organizers next to the Wall of Sheep display . )
But the private wired network , which reporters at the conference use , is supposed to be off limits for the Black Hat shame game .
Kurt Opsahl , a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation who was operating a clinic at the conference to advise attendees on computer security legal matters , said given the facts that are currently known , the sniffing would be considered illegal under federal law , which requires one party in a communication to be aware that monitoring is occurring .
Although the wireless network at Black Hat is known to be a hostile network and people who use it expect it to be scanned by hackers , Opsahl said reporters in the press room have an expectation of secure communication on the private network that conference organizers set up especially for them to use .
" It 's designed to be a safe harbor within a fairly stormy sea , " Opsahl said .
He added that it 's important to provide a safe network for reporters to communicate securely with their home offices because many reporters covering the conference may not know how to secure their communications on their own .
The Black Hat spokeswoman said the three reporters did n't try to hide how they obtained the information and were honest with the Wall of Sheep administrators about where they collected it .
The spokeswoman said the Wall of Sheep organizers refused to post the information .
The three French reporters have been identified as Mauro Israel , Marc Brami , and Dominique Jouniot .
Israel and Brami registered with the conference as reporters for Global Security Magazine , a magazine which is one of the conference 's media sponsors ( media sponsors give the conference free advertising in their publications ) .
The spokeswoman said that Brami has been covering the conference for his publication for a number of years .
Journalists who saw the French reporters in the press room identified all three as males of middle age .
The spokeswoman said the reporters , when questioned about their activity , said they wanted to educate reporters to surf more securely .
They told her that many reporters covering the Beijing Olympics are n't aware of the measures they need to take to secure their communications .
They wanted to use the U.S. Black Hat security reporters as an example .
Efforts to contact the three – who have been kicked out of the conference – were unsuccessful .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) --
Officials at an African Union summit Tuesday adopted a resolution urging talks in Zimbabwe aimed at promoting peace and stability in the country , according to Egypt 's official news agency .
Robert Mugabe won re-election as Zimbabwean president in a controversial and disputed election .

However some leaders , had harsh words for Mugabe in what appeared to be sharp exchanges in closed - door meetings at the summit in Sharm el - Sheikh .
The Associated Press reported that Botswana 's president said Robert Mugabe 's government should not be recognized and that Zimbabwe should be barred from AU gatherings .
Earlier Tuesday , Mugabe 's spokesman said talk of Western intervention in the country 's election crisis smacks of colonialism , and that the UK " can go and hang a thousand times . "
The comments came as it was revealed that opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has left the Netherlands Embassy in Harare , where he sought sanctuary a week ago .
His Movement for Democratic Change party also denied Tuesday being in discussions to create a unity government .
George Charamba , a spokesman for Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe , told reporters at the African Union summit in Egypt : " The way out is a way defined by the Zimbabwean people , free from outside interference , and that is exactly what will resolve the matter .
" For as long as there are some external interests that are seeking to express themselves within our own politics , then naturally we have that kind of resistance because for us it recalls a certain experience , ugly experience we have gone through before , that of colonialism . "
When asked specifically about Britain 's influence in the election -- and criticism of the Mugabe government -- Charamba bristled .
" They can go and hang , " he said .
" They can go and hang a thousand times , they have no basis , they have no claim on Zimbabwean politics at all and that is exactly the issue . "
Mugabe has been Zimbabwe 's only leader since its independence from Britain in 1980 , when it was called Rhodesia .
He overwhelmingly won a presidential runoff against Tsvangirai last Friday , although he was the only candidate ; international observers have also widely condemned and discredited the election .
Watch Mugabe 's outburst in a hallway at the AU Summit »
Tsvangirai left the Dutch Embassy Monday morning and returned to his home in Harare , Rob Dekker , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , said Tuesday .
The Foreign Ministry remains in contact with Tsvangirai and he can return if he deems it necessary , Dekker added .
Tsvangirai arrived at the embassy on June 22 , hours after he announced he was withdrawing from the presidential runoff against incumbent Mugabe .
He cited political violence , intimidation and vote rigging as his reasons for withdrawing .
Word of Tsvangirai 's departure came as Business Day , a South African newspaper , reported that President Thabo Mbeki 's envoys had secured commitments from Tsvangirai and Mugabe on a power - sharing deal .
But the MDC promptly denied the report , which said Tsvangirai and Mugabe would work to implement a new constitution and other reforms .
The newspaper did not name its sources , but Mbeki 's spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , told the paper that the envoys ' visit to Harare was " a confidential briefing intended only for the president . "
An MDC statement firmly refuted the report , saying there were " no talks or discussions " between Tsvangirai and Mugabe .
" And most importantly , there is no agreement in the offing , " the statement said .
" Nothing can be as malicious and as further from the truth . "
Ratshitanga later told CNN that the Mbeki - led mediation team has been in contact with both parties , but he would not confirm the Business Day report .
The team has consistently maintained it will not discuss the process with the media , he said .
" We hope that the challenges will be resolved , " he said .
" It would indeed be strange if the issues could n't be resolved by negotiation . "
Leaders at this week 's AU summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el - Sheikh have been slow to criticize Mugabe .
The summit has been described by a U.N. official as " a moment of truth . "
News agencies report that Mugabe was greeted warmly by some African leaders at meetings closed to the media .
He arrived at the summit after Mugabe taking the oath of office Sunday , hours after election results showed he won Friday 's vote .
Tsvangirai's party has a team of five people at the summit , led by MDC Vice President Thokozani Khupe .
" They are reporting very good progress .
They have caucused with a lot of people , " Tsvangirai said .
African leaders are divided on how to deal with Zimbabwe .
Some have been outspoken in their condemnation , with Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga saying he does not want Mugabe recognized as the legitimate head of state .
Kenya reached a power - sharing agreement this year after a disputed election ended in bloodshed .
Others , like Mbeki -- appointed by the Southern African Development Community appointed Mbeki to mediate the political dispute -- have taken a softer approach , saying that a more conciliatory stance will allow for a settlement such as a coalition government .
The U.N. and U.S. have loudly denounced the election , and a U.N. official said the situation in Zimbabwe imperils the entire region .
" This is the single greatest challenge to regional stability in southern Africa , not only because of its terrible humanitarian and security consequences but also because of the dangerous political precedent it sets , " U.N. Deputy Secretary - General Asha -Rose Migiro said .
The U.S. and other nations are working on a draft resolution to present to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday , the U.S. State Department has said .
As the 53 - member AU convened , the Elders -- a council of former world leaders led by former South African President Nelson Mandela -- urged the AU to " clearly state " that Zimbabwe 's presidential runoff was illegitimate .
" They occurred under the cloud of targeted political violence , precipitating the withdrawal of one of the two candidates , " the Elders ' statement said .
" The African election observers left no doubt :
The elections were neither free nor fair . "
All About Zimbabwe • Robert Mugabe • Morgan Tsvangirai • Thabo Mbeki • African Union
Good news , Zapp Branigan fans .
You all complained about the lack of screen time for your " hero " in the first Futurama movie , Bender 's Big Score ?
Well complain no more – you get more than your fair share of the chubby idiot in The Beast With a Billion Backs , the second direct - to - DVD feature - length episode .
And so does Amy , but that 's jumping ahead a little .
The Beast picks up where Bender 's Score left off .
It 's been one month " since space ripped open like flimsy human skin " , as newsreader Morbo pleasantly informs us .
It turns out that the cosmic anomaly is actually a gateway to another universe .
But before we learn any more about the rip , it 's time to move on to Plotline B in which Fry has found himself a new girlfriend , named Colleen ( Murphy ) .
Everyone 's happy for him – even Zoidberg , who keeps joyfully vomiting from both his seawater and freshwater stomachs .
Good news for Amy , too – Kif has asked her to be his Fonfon Ru , which I guess is kinda like a wife .
Or something .
After a quick side trip to Kif 's homeworld of Amphibios 9 for the ceremony ( conducted by the ubiquitous midwife , from the episode where Kif got pregnant ) we 're back on Earth where Fry decides to move in with Colleen .
Even after making the horrifying discovery that he is merely one of the five boyfriends she shares her apartment with .
Meanwhile , back at the anomaly , Farnsworth and his mortal enemy , Professor Wornstrom , vie for the right to send a mission to explore the thing .
And in a further strand ( which we 'll cleverly call Plotline C ) Bender discovers that the mythical League of Robots is actually real – and run by his hero , Calculon .
Enough about the plot – to say much more would be to give away too much .
Suffice it to say that in the other universe lives a planet - sized many tentacled alien named Yivo .
Who develops a rather unhealthy relationship with the denizens of planet Earth – hence the titular reference to making the beast with two backs .
So the main storyline is about a giant tentacle monster having sex with everyone in our universe .
Yep , after its " forced hiatus " Futurama came back to life with a slightly more adult bent .
It 's not quite as sweary as Family Guy , American Dad or South Park , but it 's definitely edgier than The Simpsons .
The first film had naked alien spammers ( plus the bonus of naked Leela and Amy ) .
This time we get references to flying hookworm testicles , robot penis gags , ( discreet ) sex scenes , nipples being polished with industrial sandpaper and plenty of Amy 's lovely cleavage .
And once more we get loads of callbacks to episodes of the show 's first four seasons – the Harlem Globetrotters pop up , as do those horny Amazon women and Pazuzu , king of the demons .
Plus Robot Satan is back , again voiced by Dan Castellaneta from The Simpsons .
And evil President Nixon .
Plus Stephen Hawking 's " pickled head " makes an appearance .
But again comes the big question : is it funny ?
Yes indeed .
Is it funnier than the first one ?
Again , yes indeed .
All those who complained that Bender 's Big Score lacked laughs will be eating their words this time round .
But a couple of minor quibbles ( which led to giving this 4 stars instead of 5 ) .
Like Bender 's Big Score , The Beast With a Billion Backs seems a little too geared towards the Futurama fans ( of which , admittedly , I am one ) .
And to survive on DVD , I think it needs to appeal to a broader audience and pick up some new fans .
Plus , it seems a little like 3 episodes joined together to reach feature length – more so than the first one .
But minor quibbles they are – this is still Futurama , and it still rocks .
Oh , and Fry becomes the Pope of a new religion .
Love the tentacle !
Manhunt backlash
The executives of a gay sex site are apparently more concerned about the perception that they 're associated with John McCain than McCain is about the association with them .
The chairman of the board of Manhunt , the Cambridge - based hookup site , was forced to resign after reports that he gave $ 2,300 to McCain .
Manhunt co-founder Larry Basile e-mailed the blog Towleroad :
It should be known that Jonathan Crutchley 's donation to McCain left the entire Board in disbelief .
I am disappointed that we have lost some customers , and I understand the anger .
It is too bad for the web site if we lose customers , but PLEASE never refer to me as a Republican .
I consider it an offense .
Earlier today , at the request of the Board , Jonathan has stepped down as Chairman .
McCain 's campaign has n't responded to questions about the $ 2,300 contribution .
Crutchley defended it on similar grounds to those McCain has offered on other hot - button social issues :
They agree on national security issues , and can argue domestic policy later .
Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas is the single best - selling videogame in the United States , with more than 8.6 million units sold .
Worldwide , it has sold more than 21.5 million units .
How many of those people have actually beaten the game ?
How many have even gotten past the first few hours of missions ?
I 'd kill to have those stats in front of me , because I 'm sure they 're shocking .
Talking to people about the Grand Theft Auto series over the past few weeks , I quickly came to the realization that in concentrating on the game 's mission structure and awkwardly designed gameplay , I was n't actually experiencing the game the way most players do .
I 'd heard it thrown around that " nobody ever beats a GTA " or " nobody plays the missions . "
Sounds hyperbolic – and yet I do n't think even that goes far enough to describe the majority of GTA players ' approach to the series .
They cheat .
And by trying to actually play through the Grand Theft Auto games without giving myself invincibility , infinite cash , or a never - ending supply of rocket launchers , I might have been getting a vastly different experience than the majority of the series ' biggest fans .
Welcome back to " Confessions of a Grand Theft Auto Virgin , " the weekly series in which I overcome my lifelong aversion to the GTA series and play each of the games .
This week , we load up the wagons and head to Californ - i-ay , and sunny San Andreas .
Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas ( 2004 )
As I played through each successive installment of Grand Theft Auto , I 'd been paying close attention to the development of the cinematic scenes .
GTA III was firmly in the embryonic stage .
* Vice City * looked much more like a movie , if only an alright one .
But San Andreas kicked things into high gear .
The opening cinematics , especially a high - tension early scene in which several of the main characters argued in a cemetery , were absolutely riveting .
When I mentioned this to 1up 's Jeremy Parish as we were recording an upcoming Retronauts podcast about the series , he pointed out that one reason why San Andreas ' story is stickier is that the main character , C.J. , is more sympathetic .
Tommy Vercetti from Vice City is really kind of a jerk , he said , but C.J. , avenging his mother 's death , is driven by something more than criminal ambition .
Also , I do n't know if you noticed this , but he 's black .
Last year , we got into an interesting back - and - forth with blogger Jason Ellis , who penned a list of notable black main characters in videogames .
Ellis called San Andreas " the first time that a AAA series chose a black protagonist and nobody batted an eye .
It was n't a topic of conversation , it just was . "
While it 's true that no eyes were batted over C.J. 's ethnicity , I do n't think it was a given .
I do seem to remember there being a good deal of hand - wringing about it prior to San Andreas ' release – would it be a controversial choice ?
As it turns out , however risky it was for Rockstar Games to switch up the setting , it did n't matter at all to players .
Even riskier was the shift away from a setting that was practically cartoonish to one much more real .
Mafia violence is n't something anyone is actually afraid of .
Bootleggers are n't mowing each other down with tommy guns anymore .
But gang warfare ?
That 's on the news * every night * , at least where I live .
And perhaps all of this would have stirred up some media controversy – were it not for the Hot Coffee sex minigame scandal , which dominated discussion of San Andreas .
Last week , over lunch with Wired.com columnist Clive Thompson , I told him about " Confessions " when he pointed out that the sheer length of videogames , nowadays , is keeping critics from becoming conversant in all but a few of them .
He told me that the only person he knows who " even came close " to beating Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas was a friend of his who was bedridden for three weeks and did nothing but play San Andreas .
Even then , Clive emphasized :
He only came close to finishing the game .
I pointed out that most people do n't even bother trying .
My brother 's friend , who was visiting San Francisco last week , told me that in his experience , GTA was all about turning on the cheat codes and running wild .
This made a lot of sense to me .
I 'd heard about the joys of just driving around , raising your Wanted level and causing havoc .
But in my experience with GTA III two weeks prior , you really could n't get your criminal notoriety even halfway up the scale without it pretty much being a given that you were going to get busted , fast .
How do you cause mayhem when the cops are so adept at taking you down ?
You cheat , of course .
Each GTA game has a whole list of cheat codes that you can input when the game is running , from the bizarre ( all pedestrians carry rocket launchers ) to the helpful ( invincibility , infinite ammunition ) .
Buff yourself up enough so you can survive anything , and you can feel free to raise your Wanted level to maximum – also conveniently done with a cheat code – and let the cops come after you .
Did I say the cops ?
Sorry :
When your Wanted level is that high , it 's the army that comes after you .
Suddenly there were choppers above me , two tanks rolling down the Los Santos boulevards , and a crew of infantrymen trying to take invincible C.J. down .
Here we go !
I led them in a very slow chase down the streets , because I had jacked one of the tanks .
I punched a soldier until he was dead and took his submachine gun , which I used to slaughter everything around me before hopping back in a tank .
Man , this was totally boring .
I thought : People do this for fun ?
But then I realized , again , that I was doing it wrong .
What I should be asking was not what other people do for fun in a GTA game , but what sounded fun to me .
I instantly realized what that was .
I live in San Francisco , which has a counterpart in San Andreas called San Fierro .
I could n't go there by normal means at this early point in the game , and judging by the game 's infamous length it would probably take me another 15 hours of gameplay to get there .
But with cheat codes at my disposal , it was easy : I gave C.J. massive jumping ability and infinite lung power , so I could jump and swim around the bridge that blocked me from going to San Fierro .
And I entered the code that kept the Wanted level at minimum , so the cops would n't get in the way of my journey .
Finally arriving in San Fierro after a car trip that had to have taken at least 15 minutes or so – San Andreas is a massive chunk of game geography – I took to the streets and drove around , checking for landmarks I recognized .
As it turns out , San Fierro is a horrible dystopian vision of San Francisco 's future in which the Haight / Ashbury district takes up the entire western half of the city , engulfing my quiet neighborhood in a patchouli - scented haze .
Not only that , but the hippies , having taken over half the city , have abolished Fisherman 's Wharf , the garish bayside tourist trap of seafood restaurants and souvenir shops that figures so prominently in the first Crazy Taxi .
They have also , for some reason , made the cable cars go in a massive loop around the city .
Even worse , the trolleys are indestructible and you can't hijack them , which I was really disappointed by .
But then , having in all other areas taken serious liberties with the design of San Fierro , Rockstar included a perfect scale replica of Lombard Street .
It was an interesting little trip .
But having given it the old college try , but I can't say that I 'm very much into the idea of open - ended play , GTA - style .
I like games that have goals set out for me and that reward me when I accomplish them .
Grand Theft Auto has these , but even in San Andreas they seem like a bit of an afterthought .
And that 's what I 've been struggling with .
I 'm looking for GTA IV to continue to move the series along this path , of tightening up the controls , eliminating the fluff , presenting me with a compelling single - player game that I do n't get frustrated or annoyed with .
But what if , say , 19 million of the 20 million San Andreas players could n't care less ?
Rockstar might not have a mandate to fix these things .
Moreover , tightening up the way that Grand Theft Auto plays as a single - player , linear game might actually adversely affect what it seems like the majority of players want .
They like that the world is n't quite sewn up tightly , that they can subvert the rules and cause chaos .
But for me , there 's only a limited amount of entertainment value that I can get out of that sort of experience .
That 's why I 'm now quite interested to play *
Grand Theft Auto IV *:
To see if Rockstar 's next - gen update to the series keeps me hooked , or if it simply makes it clear that my iffy feelings about the series stem not from the fact that the games are aging badly , but from the fact that * GTA * just is n't made for me .
* Grand Theft Auto IV * releases on Tuesday , April 29 .
Since I am 99 % sure I wo n't be able to review the game by then , I 'll finish this series off with a look at the portable Liberty City Stories .

Exclusive to STR
August 6 , 2008
Anyone who publicly calls for the abolition of the Fed gets my attention .
Add to his resume the fact that he rode a motorcycle across China once , circled the planet on the ground twice ( the second time with his beautiful bride ) , ran the New York City marathon three times , and is one of the world 's most successful investors as well as a best - selling author , and I 'll sit and take notes .
I did my note - taking while reading Jim Rogers 's book , Adventure Capitalist : The Ultimate Road Trip , which documents his world - spanning odyssey at the turn of the century with his wife , Paige Parker .
Unlike other books you can't stop reading , Rogers 's narrative does n't grip you so much with the tension of what might lie ahead , though there 's certainly some of that .
Instead , it holds you prisoner with fascinating detail and anecdotes written from a perspective few of us will ever experience .
He also elucidates the political and economic background of the places they visit from a refreshingly free - market , libertarian orientation .
In the early '90s , James B. Rogers , Jr. , the oldest of five boys from Demopolis , Alabama , where his phone number once consisted of a single digit , traveled the world alone with a motorcycle under him , reporting his journey in the best - seller , Investment Biker : Around the World with Jim Rogers .
So why go around again in the same decade ?
Because he wanted to see what shape the world was in as it headed into the new century .
And to do that , he had to experience it from ground level .
' In Rome , talk to the Romans , ' as he puts it .
Though he 's never patronized a prostitute , he believes you can learn more about a country by speaking to a madam of a brothel or a black marketeer than from speaking to a government minister .
Besides this , the man simply loves adventure , and his first trip only left him hungrier for more .
' If the [ millennium ] trip killed me , I would die happy , pursuing my passion .
And that was better than dying on Wall Street someday with a few extra dollars in my pocket . '
In 1996 , Rogers was giving a speech about his bike trip at the Mint Museum in Charlotte , NC .
In the audience was a young woman , a fundraiser for Queens College , whom Rogers met after the talk .
He called her the next day and said , ' Something magic happened .
Let 's pursue it . ''
Two weeks later , Paige Parker flew to New York where for their first date Rogers took her to the Boathouse Caf ' in Central Park on his bicycle built for two .
Over dinner he said to her , ' I 'm thinking of going around the world again at the turn of the millennium .
Do you want to go with me ?'
Paige said yes , but was n't thrilled about doing it on a motorcycle .
She encouraged him to consider going in a car .
To Rogers , there 's ' nothing more exhilarating than driving a motorcycle . '
But beyond the excitement there is the simplicity of getting a bike across oceans , over deserts , or through jungles .
Yes , he would consider a car , but it would have to be a sports car , a convertible , so he could put the top down and feel the wind in his face .
He ended up with a custom - built yellow Mercedes with a hardtop retractable roof , featured on his book 's cover .
It was a two - seater with four - wheel drive , boldly cartoonish in appearance .
The choice of Mercedes was easy :
Their dealerships covered the earth .
' Every dictator and Mafioso in the world drives a Mercedes , ' he writes , 'even in countries with no roads to speak of . '
For this we have government to thank , he says .
U.S. foreign aid and handouts from the World Bank and IMF have to go somewhere , and the money ends up ' fattening the bureaucrats on both sides of the transaction who diligently work the trough . '
He went with a hardtop convertible to prevent the top from being slashed and had a diesel engine installed because , unlike gasoline , diesel fuel was available everywhere .
He added an extra fuel tank and a secret compartment for hiding money , and was talked into going with an automatic transmission .
Rogers thought the vehicle 's brilliant yellow and oddball looks would attract small gatherings of the curious and thus provide a modicum of security .
But in case they were held up , he also put together a spare wallet consisting of nearly worthless currency and expired credit cards , so he would have something believable to hand over .
With trunk space reserved for the retractable top , they hauled their supplies in a trailer , and following them for much of the trip was a webmaster and videographer in a second Mercedes - - a stock SUV -- to handle the interactive real - time diary he wanted .
If he carried any kind of firearm , he did n't mention it .
Their trip began in late December 1998 in Reykjavik , Iceland and finished in late December 2001 at his father 's grave in Letohatchee , Alabama .
They covered 156,000 miles driving through 162 countries , fighting blizzards , dodging kangaroos , complying with miles of bureaucratic red tape , camping under the stars in the Sahara , eating food I do n't like to think about , and waiting for mechanics to fix the springs on their trailer .
What follows is a necessarily selective and brief account of some of the countries they passed through , but I hope it will give you a decent idea of what he means by the ' ultimate road trip . '
Ireland
Instead of people leaving Ireland , as they did for 150 years , people are now flocking to it .
Europeans , Americans , and multinationals are building factories there .
It 's a European Tiger , though it is in debt .
Hungary
Budapest is a glorious , beautiful city that could serve as a museum because little has changed in a hundred years .
Like the rest of the country , it 'has been nothing but broke . '
Yugoslavia
As they crossed into Yugoslavia , the border guards told them extra fees were required .
And they were n't accepting dinars .
In other words , they were refusing their own currency .
Dollars , deutsche marks , Austrian shillings , those were okay .
But not dinars .
' In most places around the world , the currency is like a thermometer , ' Rogers says .
' You know a country is falling apart when even the government will not accept its own currency . '
Turkey
According to a successful Turkish businessman with whom they dined one evening , Turkey could claim three of the largest corporations of their kind in Europe .
One of the companies , Sabanci , which made tire cord fabric and industrial nylon , was the largest of its kind in the world .
' You do not accomplish something like that in a week or two , ' Rogers says .
' It takes brains , the accumulation of capital , and a sound educational system . '
His optimism about Turkey quickly faded , however .
He had ordered a car cover to be made in Germany and sent to the airport at Istanbul .
When it arrived , DHL , the carrier , told him they could n't deliver it to the hotel where they were staying , he had to pick it up at the airport .
Turkish officials considered his car cover an import intended for sale .
At the airport , Rogers spent hours filling out countless forms and buying $ 75 in stamps for a cover that topped out at $ 150 .
The next day his scarred laptop arrived from New York , requiring another trip to the airport .
Altogether he had to see 22 separate officials , some of them three or four times , pay for more stamps , fill out more forms .
Georgia
Crossing into Georgia from Turkey was delayed by the fact that the border guards on both sides were drunk when they arrived .
Rogers looked up an old friend , Zaza Aleksidze , a university professor , and discovered he had the same income in 1999 that he had in 1990 , when Rogers met him .
But since then the currency had collapsed and the money was almost worthless .
Zaza lived on the fifteenth floor of a building that seldom had electricity .
China
' The best capitalists are in Communist China , ' Rogers declares unabashedly .
The Chinese have a long entrepreneurial history that was reignited by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 when he unleashed a new spirit of commerce under a policy called the Four Modernizations .
What are the keys to China 's success ?
For one , the expatriate class plays a huge role :
The country has a vast network of overseas Chinese ' in Singapore , Bangkok , Vancouver , Jakarta , New York ' who are very successful .
They may be fifth - generation Thais , but they are nonetheless Chinese .
Many of them speak Chinese .
And China opens it doors to these people .
They bring in both capital and expertise .
And the Chinese have a great work ethic :
Driving through China , we would see people constantly working the fields . . . from dawn to dusk , literally .
Indeed , they worked beyond dusk .
We saw road builders laboring under floodlights , and there were almost as many women working as men .
. .
You will not see people lounging around . . .
When Rogers rode a motorcycle across China in 1988 , he literally drove across the desert .
There were no roads .
By 1999 they had built a procession of toll roads , which in his opinion are the best in the world .
( He should know . )
Still , the Chinese desert is a very desolate place .
It is called the Takla Makan , meaning ' He who goes in does not come out . '
Yet , hundreds of years ago the Chinese figured out how to irrigate the few towns that exist there , by building tunnels under the desert that draw water from the mountains hundreds of miles to the north .
Driving across the bleakest of deserts , we were periodically brought up short by the sight of tomatoes , pumpkins , and melons growing .
The people of these oasis towns were so proficient in capturing water . . . that they were able to hose down the streets to reduce dust .
They ate at a Chinese restaurant where the food was not yet dead .
Rogers ordered snake and watched as a young man slaughtered it in front of him before sending it off to the kitchen to be cooked .
Paige ordered duck but declined the offer of seeing it killed .
In another restaurant , their waitress , Mae Wang , literally ran to tables when a patron caught her attention .
' She ran to see what she could do to serve you , ' Rogers explains .
In Nanjing , building cranes were everywhere .
He fell in love with Shanghai , which he calls ' the Emerald City of twenty - first century capitalism . '
China is second only to Japan in international currency reserves .
Japan is the world 's largest creditor , but it has vast internal debts .
China has neither a huge internal debt nor any foreign debt ' it is a net creditor .
China 's one - child policy , that ran from 1980 to 2002 , has made China a nation of only children .
People with one child are going to be very reluctant to send that child to war .
China , he expects , will be less aggressive in the future .
Japan
Japan is ' absurdly ' protectionist :
Huge amounts of money and votes lie with the rich Japanese rice farmer , which explains why rice prices in Japan are several times what they are even in the United States . . . .
The cost of a house in Japan is astronomical in part because the price of land is so high , and that in turn is due in large part to the value of rice .
No farmer is going to build an apartment house on a field that will support a crop so valuable .
Because of regulation and inflexibility , the creativity that made the country great is fast disappearing .
Japan 's many laws regarding vehicle inspections and upgrade standards make it cheaper to buy a new car every 2 - 3 years than to keep one 's current vehicle on the road .
Three - year - old cars are very expensive to own but cheap to buy ' so cheap , in fact , that a booming business has developed selling the used cars all over the world .
Siberia
All of Siberia at one time used to be China .
And the Chinese are slowly returning .
Mongolia
Mongolia is about the size of Alaska but with a population roughly the same as Kansas City 's .
As a recipient of foreign aid and with no infrastructure to upgrade , Mongolia spent the largess on technology .
They now take plastic , credit or debit .
Everyone has a cell phone ' even the nomads crossing the country on horseback .
Russia
Russia is a third - world country .
Capital will not come to its aid .
Intelligent capital does not aid thieves .
Africa
There are a million Africas , but from a distance one tends to see only two : North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa .
Or white Africa and black .
By way of illustration , he offered this anecdote :
While ordering food in a Korean restaurant in Mauritania that served only Chinese food , they were having trouble with their French , so the owner brought out a dishwasher who spoke perfect English , an African woman from Ghana , a thousand miles to the south .
She like many others were working their way north trying to get to Europe .
Throughout Africa Rogers found ' vast numbers of people with talent and drive willing to labor from dawn to dusk , their work ethic no less powerful than that of the Chinese . '
But war and corrupt politics were limiting opportunities .
Most foreign aid to Africa ' winds up with outside consultants , the local military , corrupt bureaucrats , the new NGO administrators , and Mercedes dealers .
There are Mercedes dealers in places where there are not even roads . '
He adds : ' What our aid buys first is guns to keep thieves in power . '
They traveled down Africa 's west coast then up the east coast .
When they reached Sudan , they were stuck for 12 days trying to get into Egypt , which Rogers considers a ' world - class bureaucratic disaster . '
They finally got there by taking a barge across Lake Naser , a five - day trip of ' devastating boredom . '
When they reached Aswan , some 250 miles into Egypt , officials impounded their car , demanding that he prove ownership .
For that , Rogers had to put Paige up at a hotel while he flew to Cairo to purchase more stamps .
Pakistan
In late 2000 when they arrived , U.S. relations with Pakistan were poor .
President Clinton had recently toured India , with whom Pakistan had been at war off and on since 1947 , but made only a stopover at the airport in Pakistan .
Hillary had recently returned a $ 50 K campaign donation from Pakistani - American doctors for her Senate race .
And the U.S. had recently sold a large number of fighter planes to Pakistan , took the money , but refused to deliver the planes .
But on September 12 , 2001 , Pakistan became ' America 's great ally and longtime friend . '
In Pakistan , every restaurant had at least 10 guys sitting around with submachine guns .
Pakistan is predominantly agricultural and depends for water on an ingenious system of dams and interchanges known as Sukkar Barrage .
Like the Answar Dam in Egypt , its destruction would ruin the country .
India
' Savagery has been a way of life here since 1947 , ' Rogers says .
Immediately after independence , Hindus in Pakistan and Muslims in India were slaughtered , hundreds of thousands of them , by the majority populations in their respective countries , sending some 12 million fleeing across the border in either direction .
India has been aggressive with other countries , warring with China , Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Sri Lanka since 1970 .
' The country epitomizes bureaucracy , chauvinism , and protectionism run amok . '
If you 're a foreigner wishing to launch an investment project in India , it would take 10 man -years to get the approvals necessary .
In India , self - described as a great incubator of information technology , we could not even use mobile phones universally .
We had to buy a different phone for almost every city .
In China , by contrast , one mobile phone works everywhere .
China has grown far more than India since 1980 , and Indians resent the Chinese for that .
Singapore
With an enormously high living standard , Singapore is probably the greatest success story of the developed world in the past 40 years .
Singapore 's neighbors began discovering oil , so Singapore began building refineries .
But regulation and protectionism are now creating rot in the financial industry .
And of course , freedom of expression is greatly curtailed .
Australia
In spite of its anti-immigration laws , Australia is a good investment opportunity because of its rich deposits of raw materials .
In Darwin , a frontier town , women in the restaurant / bars dressed half - naked because of the patrons , who were mostly miners and ranch hands .
Women would commute by air from places like Melbourne and Perth just to take part - time jobs at these places .
New Zealand
Effectively socialist during the 1960s and 1970s , New Zealnd turned itself around in 1984 , going from a protected agrarian economy to an open free market economy .
Then in 1996 , a new party , populist and xenophobic , took office and their currency soon dropped by 70 percent .
The huge immigration that had characterized New Zealand 's growth came to a halt .
There was now a net emigration out of New Zealand .
' What I saw in New Zealand was another country closing itself off to the world and borrowing lots of money . '
Rogers sold many of his investments there .
And yet , Paige fell in love with the country and wanted to move there .
Chile
Chile has a natural resources economy with a spectacular infrastructure built to serve it .
A four - lane toll road in the center of the country connects the north and south regions .
Argentina
Driving through the country , seeing that everything was so expensive and knowing the government had been borrowing heavily since 1996 , Rogers concluded that Argentina was about to collapse .
While there , he wrote an article for a Latin America magazine advising readers to get their money out of the country .
Heeding his own advice , he went to a bank in Buenos Aires where he had an account , converted his pesos to dollars , and sent them elsewhere .
Three months later , his prediction proved correct .
Brazil
Rogers predicts
Brazil will split into two countries , north and south .
Paraguay
Paraguay is one huge black market .
It 's not so much a country as it is a vast criminal enterprise .
Immigrant Amish from the United States and Canada were buying huge tracts of the country 's western wasteland , the Chaco .
Mennonites had been settling there since the 1930s .
If Paraguay would n't prosecute Dr. Josef Mengele , the Nazi Angel of Death , it certainly would n't go after Amish farmers .
Bolivia
They entered the country in Yacuiba and found a bustling market because thousands of people from overpriced Argentina flooded across the border to shop there .
Bolivia holds the record for the most governments per annum , having something like 150 coups or attempted coups in one two - year period .
The chaos consists of white guys fighting among themselves to control an indigenous people .
Bolivia has lost every war it has fought , losing a large share of its territory to its neighbors .
Bolivia has had a fairly stable government since 1982 , and economically things have improved .
It has an impressive infrastructure , and the Japanese are investing there , along with the Amish .
Plus it has trillions of feet of natural gas .
But Rogers advises caution .
He can think of three others who were bullish on Bolivia , all of whom were eventually buried there : Butch , Sundance , and Che Guevara .
Peru
It was very dangerous when he was there in 1991 .
With peace , Peru is now flush with tourists .
Venezuela
Along with a tradition of bad politicians , Venezuela is a member of OPEC .
Its second - most visible export is beauty contestants .
Panama
They were allowed to photograph the canal but not the nearby welcome sign .
The guards there told them Panamanians did not like tourists , especially American tourists .
Mexico
They spent two weeks driving north through the country .
On his previous trip , decent roads in Mexico had been scarce .
This time Mexico had new toll roads , among the most expensive in the world , and they were all crumbling .
The country 's state - run oil monopoly , Pemex , nationalized in the 1930s , accounts for 40 percent of the government 's revenues .
In 2001 , Pemex employed 137,000 workers to produce three million barrels of oil a day , about twice the workforce of countries such as Venezuela with similar production levels .
Gas stations are located where the government and its cronies dictate , rather than where the market dictates .
And the filling stations do n't take credit cards .
One station did , and it promoted the revolutionary move with a huge banner : WE TAKE VISA .
Foreign investment has declined .
Tens of thousands of jobs have left Mexico for China , which means more Mexicans will end up in the U.S .
They had to buy a tourist license to leave the country .
It took them three hours and visits to three different offices .
United States
During their absence , government was saying inflation was in check and prices were stable .
But when Rogers and his wife got home , they were shocked at how much prices had gone up .
Still , the CPI was relatively tame because government , with the aid of Wall Street and the media , was involved in a charade .
In 1996 the government began using ' hedonic adjustments , ' a term invented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in reporting price increases .
According to the BLS , for instance , the price of a Chevy had not really gone up because the new Chevy was more comfortable than the earlier model .
Gasoline was rising by only 15 percent instead of 20 percent because the new gasoline was better than the old .
In 2002 , fully 56 percent of the figures that go into the CPI were hedonically adjusted .
Rogers expected that percentage to rise .
The hedonic adjustments , of course , provide cover for the effects of the Federal Reserve 's printing press .
The Fed was trying to save Wall Street and the stock market , but instead was creating a real estate bubble .
Alan Greenspan was still the Fed chairman in 2002 .
Bob Woodward had tried to promote Greenspan as a genius in his book Maestro .
But Woodward ' knows as little about what Greenspan does as the family cocker spaniel . '
Greenspan 's history was replete with failure .
That 's why he had a government job .
As head of the Council of Economic Advisors in 1974 , Greenspan 's solution to inflation was to issue little WIN buttons , for Whip Inflation Now .
During his tenure , inflation went wild .
Soon after he became Fed chairman in 1987 , the stock market tanked by 20 percent in one day , the largest ever in terms of percentage .
A week earlier , Greenspan had assured the country that the U.S. balance - of - trade was improving and under control .
Two days later , balance - of - trade figures came out , ' and they were the worst in the history of the world . '
When Long - Term Capital Management was on the verge of collapse in 1998 , many Wall Street firms stood to be aversely affected .
They went crying to Greenspan , who , instead of letting LTCM fail and thus clean out the system , started pumping money into the system to bail out his friends .
In the 18 months that followed , NASDAQ soared , because new money tends to flow into financial assets first .
On TV everyone was going nuts over the ' New Economy ' and the bull market .
Yet the economy was going down , and profits had peaked .
About 30 big stocks were distorting the picture .
Take them out , and it was very easy to see that a bear market was well under way .
Greenspan had panicked .
He printed money .
' He caused the bubble , pure and simple . '
Rather than take the punch bowl away , he kept refilling it .
In 2001 , Greenspan hit the panic button again .
The printing presses ran harder that year than ever before .
Bush was spending as fast as Greenspan could print .
Most Americans were thinking , ' Well , things are n't so bad after all . '
The maestro had perpetrated a housing and consumption bubble by driving down interest rates .
Both Greenspan and Bernanke stated they will do everything they can to prevent prices from declining in the United States .
There will be no deflation .
They will buy any asset to drive prices higher .
To Rogers , that means sell U.S. dollars .
There may very well be a deflation sometime down the road , ' but before that happens the government will print money until the world runs out of trees . '
Conclusion
He drove around the world when he did ' to get a measure of the world 's heart rate as it jumped a millennial divide . '
' The largest and most prosperous city at the end of the last millenium was Cordoba , Spain . . .
What will the world look like a thousand years from now ? '
Based on his travels and the changes he 's seen , he is quite certain ' that in a thousand years [ the world ] will be all but unrecognizable . '
' I promise you that the time will come , however unfortunate , if not four hundred years from now , then certainly by the turn of the next millennium , that few will be able to name a single American president , not even George Washington . '
He quotes Ernest Hemingway :
The first pancea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency ; the second is war .
Both bring temporary prosperity ; both bring permanent ruin .
Both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists .
Though written six years ago , Rogers 's book is a still a fascinating and relevant read .
I find it interesting that gold has been mankind 's money through much of its history , and with few exceptions , governments have either corrupted or outlawed gold in an attempt to maximize their power .
In the perpetual war between government and sound money , perhaps the latter will finally emerge victorious , and the next millennium will be unrecognizable today because the world will be a place of peace and prosperity .
The most commonly used Olympics medals table is based on the number of gold medals and it puts China top and Great Britain third .
But what happens if other factors are taken into account ?
Much has been made of the Great Britain team 's lofty position in third place in the Olympics medals table .
That is based on the number of gold medals , with the number of silver and bronze medals only counting when two countries have the same number of golds .
We have won one gold medal in the last 48 hours and our six - gold advantage has almost disappeared entirely
BBC's Matt Slater
Official medals table Olympics blog : Battle for third
This system counts against countries like France which , as of 1000 BST on Friday morning , had enjoyed 32 podium finishes but only a handful of wins .
Maybe with this in mind , and half an eye on China , media in the US have been publishing a table of total medals won , regardless of colour , and that puts the US top .
Here are five alternative ways to interpret how countries rank , taking into account gold , silver and bronze , population size , gross domestic product and size of the Olympic team .
The medal tallies were counted at 1000 BST on Friday .

It was shortly after the bipartisan Iraq Study Group issued its recommendations to Congress in late 2006 that a directive came down from the highest levels of the Pentagon : an order for another war game involving Iran .
The study group had proposed that the Bush administration engage in direct diplomatic talks with its nemesis , a nation that Washington says supports terrorism , encourages attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq , and , most ominously , is developing nuclear weapons .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time , Gen. Peter Pace , asked the Defense Department 's top war gamers to construct a scenario to be played out in early 2007 .
" We postulated that the president of the United States actually took the advice of the Iraq Study Group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with Iran , " says one defense analyst who took part .
Talks stall .
There may be few greater symbols , senior officials point out , than the nation 's military gaming diplomacy to illustrate the Pentagon 's wariness of war with Iran .
Such a conflict remains among the options " on the table , " as President Bush reiterated in July , if Iran continues its nuclear program .
The alternative approach , the European - led multilateral talks with Iran , stalled this month after the deadline expired on yet an- other offer of economic incentives .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed that his country would not surrender its " nuclear rights " in the face of U.S. and European demands to halt uranium enrichment , the process that produces fuel for generating electricity and making nuclear bombs .
He has also threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz , the strategic waterway through which some 40 percent of the world 's oil passes , in the event of any American military attack .
In the wake of these events , the Bush administration expressed its exasperation .
" In case he has n't noticed , " White House Press Secretary Dana Perino quipped , " we are trying to talk to them . "
The Pentagon has noticed , well aware that the White House is capable of doing more than throwing up its hands in frustration .
Military leaders recognize the precarious ambiguity of America 's red line with Iran — and that of Israel , which says Iran 's nuclear program poses an " existential threat . "
Mindful of these dynamics and engaged in wars on two fronts , there have been few greater proponents for U.S. diplomatic overtures than the Department of Defense .
Since taking over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year , Adm .
Mike Mullen has repeatedly warned — often quite publicly — that military action against Iran , though possible , would be " extremely stressing " for an already overstretched U.S. military .
" I 'm fighting two wars , and I do n't need a third one , " Mullen said recently .
" There 's a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is , " adds a senior military official , " but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want . "
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has also weighed in against action , noting recently that it would be " disastrous on a number of levels . "
The forthrightness on the part of the top two American defense officials has fed speculation that this is pushback against those within the Bush administration — Vice President Dick Cheney 's name often comes up here — who might be inclined to open up a third front for U.S. forces with a strike against Iran .
In light of the Iraq experience , " generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid , and Gates is more willing to listen , " says Andrew Bacevich , professor of international relations at Boston University .
" Mullen is n't just saying these things for our benefit — I think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership . "
Or the Pentagon brass is simply stating the obvious , as some senior officials contend , mindful that the final word comes from the White House .
" There are lots of opinions about where we 're headed with Iran and a lot of healthy discussion " in the administration , says the senior military official .
" But to set the debate along the lines of ' to bomb or not to bomb ' is n't a fair characterization . "
Says Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell , " The views the secretary has expressed on this issue are entirely his own , and they are entirely consistent with his colleagues in the administration . "
The widely held view within the Pentagon is that any military strike on Iran would be a dangerous , highly complicated undertaking .
" There 's a lot about Iran that we still just do n't understand , " says the senior military official .
" They are very , very hard to predict . "
Adds the defense analyst , " A lot of generals are saying , ' Are you sure you really want to do this ?
Are the gains worth the risk ? ' "
Shadow games .
In scenarios routinely war - gamed by the Pentagon , the recurring answer tends to be no .
The risks are considerable , and these shadow games — conceptual exercises intended to test out ideas — often end badly for the U.S. side .
" In so many scenarios , it 's a nightmare , " says Bruce Riedel , a former CIA officer and Middle East fellow with the Brookings Institution who has taken part in war games .
One of the biggest nightmares , a land invasion of Iran , is widely dismissed as a nonstarter .
" Unless it 's happened in the deepest recesses of the Pentagon , I 've never been involved in a war game that seriously considered a land invasion of Iran , " says the defense analyst .
At the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , Maj .
Bruce
Terry estimated in his widely circulated master 's thesis last year that it would take at least four years to mobilize the more than 1 million U.S. troops required for such an endeavor , followed by U.S. casualties in the tens of thousands for each year of occupation .
The working war scenarios involve surgical strikes by cruise missiles and warplanes on key targets , such as Revolutionary Guard facilities and Iranian nuclear sites , often coupled with covert operations on the ground .
These attacks have been war - gamed regularly since 2004 , according to another defense adviser , and the results point to some considerable stumbling blocks .
" The No. 1 problem we have is : ' Where are the targets ? '
We still have trouble accurately locating all of the pieces of the nuclear program that we need to take out in order to have a relatively decisive effect , " says Bacevich .
That uncertainty extends to assessments of when Iran could have nuclear - bomb capability , something that Iranians assert is not their plan .
The consensus U.S. intelligence view points to the 2010 to 2015 timeframe , while Israeli estimates predict it as soon as late 2009 .
The differences reflect disagreements about the intelligence , as well as about what level of capability should be viewed as the weapons threshold .
What is clear is that Iranian nuclear facilities are buried , dispersed , and protected — and U.S. bombs may not be able to reach deeply enough to destroy them .
Some are also in close vicinity to schools , hospitals , and other facilities where there could be civilian casualties that would further inflame anti-Americanism across the Muslim world .
By most accounts , bombing might set back Iran by only a few years — at a high cost to the United States .
Such strikes come with the prospect of retaliation in the Strait of Hormuz , though such a move would cut off Iran 's own oil exports as well .
It is a narrow chokepoint , and an Iranian attempt to obstruct tanker traffic would cause oil to soar far above even recent record prices with dire consequences for western economies .
Iran could employ swift boat - swarming tactics and the threat of Chinese - made antiship cruise missiles launched from patrol boats and from small islands off its coast .
" The Strait is always the key for war games in the Gulf , " says Paul Van Riper , a retired Marine three - star general who unleashed an imaginary salvo of Silkworm - style missiles , overwhelming the sensors on U.S. warships , while playing a " red team " country that closely resembled Iran in a now legendary 2002 war game .
" High stress . "
There is , too , the issue of mines .
" Nobody 's underestimating Iran 's ability to disrupt access to the strait , " adds a senior Navy officer who recalls serving on a U.S. warship accompanying Kuwaiti oil tankers in 1988 .
" People brush over the tanker wars , but the Navy has n't forgotten , " he says .
" It was high stress , " and two Navy ships were heavily damaged by mines .
Despite antimine technology , the officer recalls that the crew set up a chair and built a shade for it , so that a seaman on deck could scan the water round - the - clock for mines .
The Navy practiced repelling swarming Iranian swift boats and mounted machine guns for just such an event on the side of its ships .
Most believe that the U.S. military could , with some effort , quickly reopen the strait and most likely sustain little damage at the hands of the 1970s - era planes and weapons that make up the bulk of the Iranian Air Force .
But the greater concern is the asymmetric chaos that Iran could unleash in neighboring countries , says Larry Wilkerson , who was chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell .
Wilkerson recalls that in his first briefing after taking that job in 2002 , the topic was the attacks Iranian - backed Hezbollah could mount against Israel and elsewhere .
" They said Hezbollah is the A - team , and not someone we want to take on , because they were essentially 10 or 15 times the capability of al Qaeda , " says Wilkerson .
U.S. troops in Iraq likely would face stepped - up attacks by Iranian - backed militias , and the Karzai government in Afghanistan would collapse , says Riedel .
" He could n't choose between us and the Iranians . "
A U.S. strike , analysts warn , could also have the undesired effect of bolstering Ahmadinejad — as a nation under attack rallies around even an unpopular leader — and alienating the more progressive , anti-Ahmadinejad factions .
An Israeli strike on Iran — with or without U.S. support — would offer all of these risks and more minuses , say senior defense officials .
For this reason , in recent meetings in Israel , Mullen " conveyed his less - than - enthusiastic view of an Israeli attack , " says a senior military official .
Says Riedel , " From an Iranian perspective , Israel would be flying American - made F - 15s and F - 16s , dropping bombs made in the USA , " he adds .
" Within the Pentagon , not only do they see the downsides , they tend to think that if someone 's going to do this , they do n't want to see it outsourced to another air force . "
Still , it is in the best interest of the Bush administration to show that it takes Iran 's threat to Israel seriously " in hopes of being able to restrain the Israelis , " says Bacevich .
The decision by scandal - damaged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down once his party chooses a successor in September creates a new uncertainty .
" I do n't know whether that keeps an operation from happening .
Olmert may want to do this one thing on his way out , " says Riedel .
" I , for one , am convinced that it's a very real possibility . "
That possibility increases each time diplomacy falters .
But the Pentagon 's diplomatic war game concluded that talking does n't guarantee resolution , either .
There were some useful findings — the benefits of engaging Middle East neighbors , for example .
" Regionally , there was very strong interest in limiting Iran 's growth and power that we have n't exploited as a country , " says the defense analyst .
Yet , just as in real life , direct talks with Iran proved consistently tricky in that exercise .
" We could get small concessions and promises to talk again , " the analyst adds .
" But there were no significant breakthroughs or eurekas that made us say , ' This idea is so wonderful that we need to run down the hall and try it right now . ' "
Apple is worth more than Google .
Huh ?
This does n't make sense to me .
Let 's start with the obvious :
Google makes more money than Apple does .
It had earnings of $ 10 billion over the past 12 months , compared to $ 8 billion for Apple .
And while both companies ' earnings are growing fast , Google 's are growing faster .
But here 's the clincher : Google 's earnings were on less than $ 20 billion of revenue – that 's what I call a profit margin .
Apple , by contrast , needed more than $ 30 billion of revenue to get its $ 8 billion of gross profit .
Of course , when it comes to stock valuations , the present does n't matter nearly as much as the future .
So what does the future hold for these two franchises ?
They 're both strong technology giants with very large " moats . "
But Google is stronger , and its moat is bigger .
It owns search , certainly in Europe and the Americas , and it 's making strong inroads into display advertising as well .
Sam Gustin might be kvetching about " the toll being inflicted on Web advertising by the slowing economy , " but the growth rates are still pretty torrid for what is now a reasonably mature industry :
Karsten Weide , an analyst at IDC , told Bloomberg that online ad spending grew 18.9 percent in the second quarter , a growth rate 7 percentage points lower than a year ago .
Were it not for the slumping economy , web ad spending would have grown by more than 20 percent , she said .
19 % market growth ?
I think Apple would be very happy with that .
And remember that Google is increasing , not decreasing , its share of total online ad spending .
Over at Apple , by contrast , the iPod / iTunes duopoly can't help but see its market share eroded going forwards , as DRM - free online music stores start competing on price , the record labels try to cut Apple down to size , and the marginal utility from buying your fourth or fifth iPod starts to decline .
Apple 's phone business looks great right now , but the industry is notoriously cutthroat , Apple does n't have the degree of control it 's used to elsewhere , and in any case handset margins are never going to be as big as margins on iPods or MacBooks .
Yes , the iPhone app store is a very promising business model – but it 's going to be quite some time , if ever , before it makes a significant contribution to Apple 's bottom line .
And then there 's the computer business .
Macs are selling well , at very high margins .
But Google 's muscling in on the computing business too : over the long term , it makes sense to do all your computing in an ever - improving cloud than it does on specific , individually - owned pieces of hardware which always , eventually , break .
The more important the cloud , the less important the computer , and the less important the computer 's operating system , too .
Howard Lindzon , by contrast , thinks the stock market is right , and that Apple should be worth more than Google .
Two of his arguments are weak : that " social search " will make Google obsolete ( I 'll believe it when I see it ) , and that " MacBooks are getting cheaper " ( no they 're not : Apple 's entry - level laptop has been priced between $ 1,000 and $ 1,100 for years , and it 's going to stay there ) .
Howards best argument is that a falling Google share price could become self - fulfilling : " if the stock lingers between $ 500 or worse yet , drifts lower , you will see a brain drain of epic proportions , " he says .
Google 's competitive advantage has long been that it was smarter and richer and one or two steps ahead of the competition .
As it matures , it might not have the same ability to attract the very best and the brightest .
But if Google has job risks , Apple has Jobs risk – which is much bigger and probably just as imminent .
No one at Google is even as important to the company as Jonathan Ive is to Apple , let alone Steve Jobs .
If I 'm holding a stock as a long - term investment ( which is the only sensible way to hold a stock ) then I do n't want to run the risk that the company will founder the minute the CEO exits .
And talking of the long term , the option value of all those crazy Google projects which never make any money is huge .
There 's a good chance that , eventually , one of them will take off in a big way , and if it 's energy - related , it could make Google 's present business look positively puny .
Google stock is volatile , just as the founders said it would be in their prospectus .
But if I was going to sleep today to wake up in ten years ' time , I 'd be much happier with Google stock under my mattress than Apple .
Geneva , 7 August 2008 .
CERN has today announced that the first attempt to circulate a beam in the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) will be made on 10 September .
This news comes as the cool down phase of commissioning CERN 's new particle accelerator reaches a successful conclusion .
Television coverage of the start - up will be made available through Eurovision .
The LHC is the world 's most powerful particle accelerator , producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine , and around 30 times more intense when it reaches design performance , probably by 2010 .
Housed in a 27 - kilometre tunnel , it relies on technologies that would not have been possible 30 years ago .
The LHC is , in a sense , its own prototype .
Starting up such a machine is not as simple as flipping a switch .
Commissioning is a long process that starts with the cooling down of each of the machine 's eight sectors .
This is followed by the electrical testing of the 1600 superconducting magnets and their individual powering to nominal operating current .
These steps are followed by the powering together of all the circuits of each sector , and then of the eight independent sectors in unison in order to operate as a single machine .
By the end of July , this work was approaching completion , with all eight sectors at their operating temperature of 1.9 degrees above absolute zero ( - 271 °C ) .
The next phase in the process is synchronization of the LHC with the Super Proton Synchrotron ( SPS ) accelerator , which forms the last link in the LHC 's injector chain .
Timing between the two machines has to be accurate to within a fraction of a nanosecond .
A first synchronization test is scheduled for the weekend of 9 August , for the clockwise - circulating LHC beam , with the second to follow over the coming weeks .
Tests will continue into September to ensure that the entire machine is ready to accelerate and collide beams at an energy of 5 TeV per beam , the target energy for 2008 .
Force majeure notwithstanding , the LHC will see its first circulating beam on 10 September at the injection energy of 450 GeV ( 0.45 TeV ) .
Once stable circulating beams have been established , they will be brought into collision , and the final step will be to commission the LHC 's acceleration system to boost the energy to 5 TeV , taking particle physics research to a new frontier .
' We 're finishing a marathon with a sprint , ' said LHC project leader Lyn Evans .
' It 's been a long haul , and we 're all eager to get the LHC research programme underway . '
###
CERN will be issuing regular status updates between now and first collisions .
Journalists wishing to attend CERN for the first beam on 10 September must be accredited with the CERN press office .
Since capacity is limited , priority will be given to news media .
The event will be webcast through http://webcast.
cern. ch , and distributed through the Eurovision network .
Live stand up and playout facilities will also be available .
A media centre will be established at the main CERN site , with access to the control centres for the accelerator and experiments limited and allocated on a first come first served basis .
This includes camera positions at the CERN Control Centre , from where the LHC is run .
Only television media will be able to access the CERN Control Centre .
No underground access will be possible .
The eighth leading cause of death in the U.S. is medication error .
This statistic may surprise you .
Other frightening statistics include the following :
* 7,000 deaths occur each year that are directly attributable to medication errors .
* Errors occur around 1 in 5 times that medication is administered .
* The FDA estimates 1 death per day due to medication errors .
The three most common errors are giving an improper dose , giving the wrong drug , and giving the drug by the wrong route ( for example , intravenous instead of oral ) .
Everyone involved in health care is aware of errors and know that they occur more often than they should .
The question then becomes :
If it is known that errors are happening , what can be done to prevent them ?
Nursing personnel are the front - line staff most often responsible for administering medications to patients .
Any factor that decreases the effective functioning of nursing staff will impact how safely nurses can perform their duties .
The nursing shortage impacts nursing care in a negative way .
A shortage of nursing staff translates to fewer nurses to care for the same amount of patients .
The shortage of nurses also means that nurses are working overtime more often , and coming in to work on their days off more often .
Nurses often work in excess of 12 hours a day .
All of these factors add up to fatigue and stress , a double whammy when it comes to human error .
Hospitals are now turning to technology to attempt to decrease hospital medication errors .
Computer - generated prescriptions cut down on errors that occur in transcribing doctor ’s orders .
In some centers , nurses are being provided with hand - held computers that contain drug information on dosing , routes , and adverse effects .
Medications are being provided in single - dose packaging , and drugs that have names similar to other drugs are packaged differently and include clearer labeling .
Dangerous medications are signed for by two staff members instead of one ( for example , insulin , narcotics , and anticoagulants ) .
Abbreviations that are dangerous or misleading have been abolished in some cases .
Patients are now becoming more educated about their medications , their conditions , and their treatment , but too many still blithely accept medications and treatments without asking questions of health care personnel .
All too often , patients are not aware of the names , correct doses , and prescribing reasons behind the medications they are on .
Questioning medical personnel about their medications and why they are being given these medications is one way that patients can help safeguard themselves .
The nursing shortage is not likely to end any time in the near future .
Decreasing the risk of medication errors is the job of all medical personnel who care for patients .
Doctors can do their part by writing ( or printing ) orders legibly and clearly stating their orders with no ambiguity .
Nursing staff who administer medications need to take advantage of all technology available that may help them do their jobs more safely .
Finally , patients need to be their own best advocates by being fully aware of their treatment plan and medications .
If a patient is unable to understand , a family member or friend can take on this role .
To err is human but , by working together , hospital personnel can help reduce the staggering statistics of medication error .

The Comcast Corporation plans to slow service to its heaviest Internet users during periods of congestion after regulators ordered the company to devise a new method for managing its Web traffic .
Top Internet speeds for the heaviest users will be reduced for 10 to 20 minutes to keep service to other users flowing , said Mitch Bowling , Comcast ’s senior vice president and general manager for online services .
The Federal Communications Commission found on Aug. 1 that Comcast had improperly blocked peer - to - peer programs like BitTorrent that are used to share video and other files .
In an order posted on its Web site on Wednesday , the F.C.C. gave the company 30 days to provide details of its “ unreasonable network management practices ” and show how they would be changed by year - end .

Book Cites Secret Red Cross Report of C.I.A. Torture of Qaeda Captives
By SCOTT SHANE
WASHINGTON — Red Cross investigators concluded last year in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency ’s interrogation methods for high - level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes , according to a new book on counterterrorism efforts since 2001 .
The book says that the International Committee of the Red Cross declared in the report , given to the C.I.A. last year , that the methods used on Abu Zubaydah , the first major Qaeda figure the United States captured , were “ categorically ” torture , which is illegal under both American and international law .
The book says Abu Zubaydah was confined in a box “ so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position ”  and was one of several prisoners to be “ slammed against the walls , ”  according to the Red Cross report .
The C.I.A. has admitted that Abu Zubaydah and two other prisoners were waterboarded , a practice in which water is poured on the nose and mouth to create the sensation of suffocation and drowning .
The book , “ The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , ”  by Jane Mayer , who writes about counterterrorism for The New Yorker , offers new details of the agency ’s secret detention program , as well as the bitter debates in the administration over interrogation methods and other tactics in the campaign against Al Qaeda .
The book is scheduled for publication next week by Doubleday .
The New York Times obtained an advance copy .
Citing unnamed “ sources familiar with the report , ”  Ms. Mayer wrote that the Red Cross document “ warned that the abuse constituted war crimes , placing the highest officials in the U.S. government in jeopardy of being prosecuted . ” 
Red Cross representatives were not permitted access to the secret prisons where the C.I.A. conducted interrogations , but were permitted to interview Abu Zubaydah and other high - level detainees in late 2006 , after they were moved to the military detention center in GuantÃ¡namo Bay , Cuba .
The book says the C.I.A. shared the report , which Ms. Mayer first described last year in less detail in The New Yorker , with President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Bernard Barrett of the International Committee of the Red Cross declined to comment on the book except to say that the committee “ regrets that any information has been attributed to us ”  because it believes its work is more effective when confidential .
He did confirm that committee personnel “ are regularly visiting ”  the high - level Qaeda prisoners , now at GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
“ We have an ongoing confidential dialogue with members of the U.S. intelligence community , and we would share any observations or recommendations with them . ” 
The book says Abu Zubaydah told the Red Cross that he had been waterboarded at least 10 times in a single week and as many as three times in a day .
The book also reports that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the chief planner of the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , told the Red Cross that he had been kept naked for more than a month and claimed that he had been “ kept alternately in suffocating heat and in a painfully cold room . ” 
The report says the prisoners considered the “ most excruciating ”  of the methods being shackled to the ceiling and being forced to stand for as long as eight hours .
Eleven of the 14 prisoners reported prolonged sleep deprivation , the book says , including “ bright lights and eardrum - shattering sounds 24 hours a day . ” 
Ms. Mayer acknowledges that Red Cross investigators based their account largely on interviews with the prisoners .
But she writes that several C.I.A. officers she spoke with confirmed parts of the Red Cross description .
A C.I.A. spokesman , Paul Gimigliano , confirmed that Red Cross workers had been “ granted access to the detained terrorists at GuantÃ¡namo and heard their claims . ” 
He said the agency ’s interrogations were based on “ detailed legal guidance from the Department of Justice ”  and had “ produced solid information that has contributed directly to the disruption of terrorist activities . ” 
“ The Dark Side ”  also describes a frightening false alarm at the White House on Oct. 18 , 2001 , when , it says , an alarm went off on a machine designed to detect biological , chemical or radiological attacks .
Among those who believed they might have been exposed to a pathogen was Vice President Dick Cheney .
Ms. Mayer quotes an unnamed “ former administration official ”  as saying , “ They thought that Cheney was already lethally infected . ” 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney , Lea Anne McBride , said his office had not seen the book and could not comment .
An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to comment on the issue said aides had investigated the book ’s account at Ms. Mayer ’s request and that “ no one recalls such an incident . ” 

In Optimizing The University - Why We Need a New Educational Model for a New Century I discussed some of the issues facing post - secondary science education .
In particular , that piece focused on how changing student demographics , modern faculty responsibilities and the new knowledge gained from advanced assessment techniques showed us that we need to fix fundamental aspects of science education if students are to receive the high quality education that is becoming increasingly important to individual and societal success .
Now I am going to discuss what this new optimized university - our university of 2020 - will look like .
While academics might wish for an ideal university with unlimited resources and no real constraints , it is more useful to ask what is possible in the real world .
So I will discuss what we need for an attainable university that provides the best undergraduate education possible within certain basic constraints on resources and organizational structures - a truly “ optimized ” university .
The constraints are based on the pragmatic assumptions that resources in support of higher education will not dramatically increase and most of the long standing structures such as disciplines and departments will be largely intact , as will the current broader faculty responsibilities .
I do not believe that it is possible to avoid these particular constraints , for two reasons :
First , there is no indication that dramatically higher levels of resources are forthcoming for public education .
Second , where attempts have been made to create universities with dramatically different organizational structures , such as the new University of California campuses without discipline - based departments , they have effectively reverted to largely traditional structures .
It is difficult to see how anything else is possible given the complexity and extensive scale of modern natural and applied science and the limitations of the human mind .
There must necessarily be some organizational unit at the level of “ extent of material that intelligent human ( i.e. faculty member ) can reasonably master ” that serves as the basic unit of educational organization .
While there are many new interdisciplinary areas of activity , from a longer - term perspective , these are primarily a continuation of the historical evolution of disciplines to remain appropriately aligned with the directions in which science and engineering is developing .
Therefore , while I assume that the labels and orientation of departments will change , there will remain entities on the size and scale ( intellectual and number of faculty ) of departments .
These will continue to be the basic organizational structure of the faculty members and the primary educational unit within the university .
While these external features of the current university and my transformed optimized university will look the same , there will be some dramatic differences .
Education in the optimized university will focus on the desired student educational outcomes and these outcomes will be measured and achieved through a structure of pervasive thoughtful use of both research on learning and information technology .
This focus on learning outcomes is in contrast to current practice of focusing on processes , such as number of students taking certain number of courses covering particular list of topics .
If properly implemented , this switch from processes to outcomes will ultimately lead to dramatically improved educational results and improvements in educational efficiency .
Another subtle but important difference of the optimized university are the roles of the student and the faculty member in the learning process .
Currently the implicit roles are that the faculty member simply transfers their expertise , as if it were bits of information , to the receptive students , much like pouring water from a large jug into a set of small receptive cups .
This model is inconsistent with what we know about how people learn science .
In the optimized university the role of the faculty will be as “ educational designers , ” utilizing their knowledge of the discipline and how best to learn that discipline to design optimized educational environments , activities , and assessment .
Within those environments , students will have the role of effortful constructors of their understanding .
A critical part of the educational design will be the ongoing formative assessment , by which the instructor , assisted by technology , will assess each student ’s development of mastery and ensure suitable targeted feedback and challenges are provided to him or her to optimize their learning .
Characteristics of the optimized university educational environment
The student will first encounter a choice of academic programs , each of which has a clearly delineated set of educational goals .
These goals are created collectively by the relevant faculty in consultation with other stakeholders such as industry , educational systems , and government , and will encompass the full set of skills , knowledge , and ways of thinking that are part of a post - secondary education .
Each academic program will then have a series of courses that are carefully aligned and sequenced to progress toward the program goals .
Each course will have its own explicit learning goals that identify what students should be able to do at the completion of the course and these will directly relate to the program goals .
These learning goals will be also be established by a consensus of the department faculty members , and will be maintained , regularly reviewed , and updated in the normal functioning of academic departments .
In each class , the student will encounter pedagogical approaches , materials , and technology all based on careful research and testing .
The student ’s learning will be measured and guided on an ongoing basis using a variety of tools and technology .
The development and improvement of these measurement tools will also be seen as a basic departmental responsibility and will reflect the values of the faculty .
Faculty teaching evaluations will be linked to these measures of student learning .
The entire educational process will be driven by these clearly established and measured outcomes of student mastery of detailed educational goals .
While it will take substantial investment to produce meaningful measures of outcome to make this possible , the knowledge base and technology now exists to make this feasible on a large scale , and the ultimate returns on this investment will be enormous .
This is the only way to ensure that good pedagogical methods and environments are replicated and improved upon , and poor ones are eliminated .
When a student starts a class in the optimized university , they will first complete a detailed diagnostic examination that accurately determines their preparation / knowledge - state .
This will examine their content and conceptual knowledge of the subject and those subjects that the course builds upon , such as mathematics and related science disciplines .
This will also diagnose their beliefs and epistemologies about the subject and how it is best learned .
Before they have ever seen an instructor , the instructor would have a profile of their strengths and weaknesses , and the computer would have already flagged serious deficiencies .
If these deficiencies are widespread , the student will be guided to enroll in a more appropriate course .
Where the deficiencies are localized and not severe , the computer would provide the student with feedback and suitable exercises that they must complete to remedy these deficiencies .
This will ensure that the course will begin with all students at roughly the same level of knowledge and competence , and the instructor will have an accurate profile of that level .
This will make it possible to design learning environments that are explicitly matched to the population of students ; something that currently is very seldom the case .
This initial extensive diagnostic exam will be the first of regular ongoing evaluations throughout the course of the student ’s thinking and learning .
These evaluations will be linked to targeted timely feedback to both student and instructor .
Such a scale of evaluation and feedback will only be practical with widespread use of information technology .
This evaluation and feedback will be largely provided by online homework systems that include intelligent grading and tutoring programs .
In this way , much of the individualized evaluation and feedback that has been lost , in moving from a personal expert tutor model to a single instructor with many students in a class model , will be reestablished .
This will be done in an economically practical manner by using IT to greatly extend the instructor ’s capabilities .
Utilizing modern educational technology
The college classroom is primarily pre-computer in its level of technology use .
However there are many new educational technologies that have been demonstrated to be highly effective and will be used widely in the optimized university .
These new technologies have the capability to transform the higher education system , in much the way the high technology industrial setting has been transformed from what it was in the 1960s .
The type of technology required for these purposes has been demonstrated in certain specific areas and has been shown to be highly effective under limited experimental conditions , and in a few of cases , fairly large - scale experiments .
However , it is used in an extremely limited fashion in education .
The quantity and quality of what exists has barely scratched the surface of what is needed and what could readily be created , if there was support to do so .
For it to be created there must be a viable business model ( which does not currently exist ) driving its development by private industry , or governmental support .
There are major problems with the creation of such a viable model , as long as there is no link between educational outcomes and resources , as discussed below .
These are much the same factors that have given us textbooks that routinely and blatantly conflict with well - proven pedagogical principles .
Assuming resources can be found to carry out the development of these valuable educational technologies , their development must be guided by knowledge of the specific disciplines and research on how people learn .
A clear understanding of the educational capabilities and limitations of IT and careful testing of the products are also essential .
The untapped potential educational applications of IT range from the mundane but time ( and hence money ) saving to the highly sophisticated new methods for learning .
It would require a far longer paper to do justice to this subject , but some of these applications include technology for new teaching methods ( interactive simulations , intelligent tutors , sophisticated diagnostic capabilities , student in - class personal response systems “ clickers ” ) , improved class organization and management systems , archival systems for educational materials and data , and new modes of presenting material and enhancing communication by linking students with each other and faculty in novel ways .
Moving toward research - based instruction
The faculty of the optimized university will have sophisticated “ pedagogical content knowledge ” , in addition to the usual content knowledge for every course they teach .
This “ pedagogical content knowledge ” , as characterized by Lee Shulman , means knowing : how the content and skills are best learned , what common student difficulties are encountered in learning it , what approaches are most effective in helping students overcome those difficulties , and how best to motivate students to master the subject .
This also requires knowing the relevant research on learning , and assessment of learning , as it specifically applies to the subject in question .
In the optimized university , a general knowledge about how people learn science will be part of every faculty members ’ basic competence , and the many subject specific pedagogical and assessment issues will be fully researched , and detailed information on them will be readily available to every faculty member .
When a faculty member is starting out to teach a course , their first step would be to study these course - specific pedagogical content materials .
While the student will likely still see an instructor in charge of each particular course in the optimized university , the relationship between the course and instructor will be rather different .
The department will have the basic responsibility for each course and what students are learning in it .
The instructor of a course will thus be working as part of a collective enterprise to optimize the course within the goals , guidelines , and assessments established by the department .
Faculty members will work in teams to first establish clear educational goals from large scale to specific topic level , and then collectively develop and refine approaches , materials , and assessment tools .
The products produced by these collective efforts will be routinely reused and improved upon to provide ever more efficient and effective instruction .
Members of the faculty team will each share their strengths to achieve a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts , and , in the process , expertise will be shared so that younger , less experienced , faculty will rapidly gain teaching expertise .
This is in stark contrast with the current system where teaching is an isolated activity in which faculty set their own agendas and goals for the courses they teach , and they struggle in isolation to teach the subject effectively .
They seldom know what students have mastered in previous courses or exactly what students will be expected to know in their subsequent courses , and all of those change with each new instructor in every course .
Although the collaborative approach described above is highly unusual in teaching , it is not unprecedented .
Also , all of these activities and modes of operating are the norm in the modern scientific research lab .
Hence the problem is not one of convincing faculty to function in a radically new manner , but rather the lesser challenge of getting them to see how approaches that they know and recognize as very effective in one setting ( the research lab ) can be equally effective in another ( teaching ) .
A common claim is that such a collective approach to teaching would fail because what are effective or ineffective teaching and learning styles are totally or largely dependent on the individual personalities of the teacher and learner .
Such a claim is quite inconsistent with a large amount of research data .
All normal human brains function in the same basic way , and research has clearly established that there are very general features of effective teaching and learning .
While there of course are individual distinctions , particularly in the learners , these distinctions are small compared to the range of teaching approaches for which there are advocates .
For example , there is extensive physics education research literature examining the effectiveness of various teaching practices .
This consistently shows that practices that increase the average learning for a class also increase the learning for each of the subgroups of low , medium , and high achieving students in the class .
The individual student distinctions with respect to effective teaching styles are evident primarily only at the much finer level of the student thinking on specific topics .
Thus , they are best addressed by the careful evaluation of thinking and providing appropriate feedback as described above , rather than trying a wide variety of teaching approaches in the hope that what fails for some students might be successful for others .
Next timem I will discuss those aspects of education ; getting away from thinking that education quality is determined by the personality of the instructor and student and that some instructors and students just do n't ' have ' it .
In our optimized university of 2020 , research - proven practices make everyone a good instructor and nearly every student a good learner .
In case you have n’t noticed yet , the hand drawn style is one of the hottest design trends .
There are several ways to create hand drawn images — you can create it from scratch in Photoshop or you can scan an actual hand drawn sketch .
Personally , I like to use a scanned drawing because you get a realistic drawing texture .
Here is a quick tutorial to show you how to create a hand drawn design in Photoshop using the blending mode and alpha channel .
1 Create From Scratch in Photoshop
If you have a tablet , you can simply draw the sketch by using the brush tool .
Do n’t Have a Tablet ?
If you do n’t have a tablet , you can create the artwork in Adobe Illustrator and then imitate a hand drawing effect in Photoshop .
First draw a vector illustration .
Then import it in Photoshop .
Use a grungy brush and gently erase select parts of the image .
Use the Blur tool to create the smug effect .
2 Scan It
The easiest way — scan the drawing and set the layer blending mode to Multiply .
Invert Color
If you want to have a white color stroke instead of black — go to menu Image > Adjustments >
Invert ( or press shortcut Cmd+i ) and then select Screen blending mode .
Step It Up : Create Color Gradients
What if you want more than just a black or white stroke ( ie. colors gradients ) ?
Then you will have to extract the drawing from the white background .
A simple way to do this is by using alpha channel .
Copy ( Cmd+C ) the drawing .
In the Channels palette , create a new channel .
Then paste the drawing in the new channel .
Invert ( Cmd+i ) the channel layer .
Go back to the Layers palette , create a new layer .
Go to menu Select > Load Selection .
In the Load Selection prompt box , select Channel : " Alpha 1 " ( which is the name of the alpha channel I created earlier ) .
Shortcut Tip : the shortcut for loading a channel selection is Cmd +
Opt + any number key ( ie. 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
Learn more Photoshop shortcuts .
Fill Selection
With the channel selection loaded , you can fill it with any color .
Using It In The Design
For the purpose of this tutorial , I ’m going to show you how to incorporate your hand drawing on a female model ( the photo was purchased from iStock ) .
1. First , cut out the model .
2 . Fill the background with some sort of light glowing gradients .
3 . Paste the drawing on top of the model .
Lock the layer transparency .
Play around with the color gradients .
4. Duplicate the drawing in the background to add more details to the image .
[ Andrew D. Blechman is the author of Leisureville : Adventures in America ’s Retirement Utopias ( Grove Atlantic ) ]
Imagine what America might look like if a sizable minority of its elders secede into their own communities .
That ’s just what ’s happening , except until now no one was talking about it .
It ’s called age - segregation and it ’s an increasingly popular form of societal secession .
More than 12 million Americans aged 55 and older are expected to live in these gated playpens in the next decade or so , and that ’s a very conservative estimate .
In my book , Leisureville : Adventures in America ’s Retirement Utopias , I profile the world ’s largest retirement community , The Villages of Florida .
It ’s nearly twice the size of Manhattan , gated , and with a population that will top 110,000 .
Kids can visit , but they ’re given guest passes that time out much like international visas .
Children who overstay their limited welcome are basically reduced to the status of human contraband and their grandparents can be evicted for sheltering them .
The Villages sounds like something out of science fiction ( my book has been compared to Kurt Vonnegut ) , but it ’s real .
The community has two manufactured downtowns ( a third is on the way ) that were themed by entertainment specialists working for Universal Studios with faux historical markers , a mythological fountain of youth , a faux boardwalk , and imitation lighthouse whose efficacy is questionable given all the “ sunken ships ” in the manmade lake .
My favorite touch are the semi- buried trolley tracks , allegedly abandoned after decades of use in favor of golf carts .
Did I mention the golden oldies pumped out lampposts and fake rocks ?
The Villages is also representative of several other American trends aside from escapism , fortressing , and leisure / convenience .
A reclusive developer owns the entire community and runs the local daily “ good news ” newspaper , radio station , two television stations with newscasts and several magazines .
The newspaper , which looks like a real paper ( it even runs international wire service stores ) is a propaganda sheet for the developer who has a very real agenda .
Its penetration rate is an unheard of 90 % .
Villagers have few rights and have essentially traded in the ballot box for the corporate suggestion box .
Speaking of statistics , 99 % of daily trips made by local residents never leave “ campus . ”
The Villages is a Truman Show - esque bubble where middle aged Americans play golf , take classes , and party down in themed bars created especially for them .
But utopias and bubbles by definition do n’t last .
Even Biosphere 2 needed oxygen pumped in after a few months .
The Villages ’ oxygen equivalent is employees ( as well as local aquifers ) .
Residents do n’t produce anything , but rather consume , as is their prerogative .
Consequently , they need to be serviced by thousands of workers who happen to have needs as well , such as housing for their families and schools for their children .
Leisurevilles form potent voting blocks that generally vote against the needs of local families .
To wit : the residents of Sun City in Arizona defeated 17 school bond measures in 12 years .
Children were going to school in staggered shifts , often using trailers as classrooms .
That ’s a pretty strong message .
The fact is segregation is never a good idea .
People lose site of their commonalities when separated .
As a nation , we should begin asking ourselves if we really want to promote communities where birth certificates are scrutinized upon points of entry .
After all , complex societies require cooperation .
Furthermore these geritopias do n’t even age well .
They turn into necropolises because communities consisting solely of older residents have little interest in reinvesting in themselves .
Hero police chief who saved four is denied award
A senior Scotland Yard officer who lost an eye while helping four American FBI agents to escape a bomb blast has been denied a bravery award by the Government .
Detective Superintendent Keith Pearce - a leading counterterrorism expert - was sitting outside Luna Caprese , an Italian restaurant in the Pakistani capital Islamabad , in March when a bomb was thrown near his table .
Seated nearby were four FBI agents , two of whom were seriously hurt .
Bleeding from a serious eye injury and wounded by shrapnel , Supt Pearce , 50 - who had been training Pakistani police - pulled the two injured agents into the restaurant , treating one for a head wound , before securing the area as a crime scene .
Bloodied : Pearce after the blast
He then commandeered a truck , helped all four FBI officers into the back and ordered the driver to take them to hospital .
Supt Pearce 's eye was so badly injured that it later had to be removed at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London .
He is now registered as disabled .
Sources said that Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair had personally recommended Supt Pearce for an award .
But after informal soundings with several Whitehall Ministries , the Yard was advised that Supt Pearce was not eligible because those he had helped were not British citizens .
' Advice was given that there were complications because of that fact , ' said a source .
A Home Office spokesman said : ' We do not comment on individual award recommendations . '
During the WW2 Russian Army was using a “ Fire Hedgehog ” – the set of 88 Tommy - gun alike machine guns loaded into a plane .
It was used at low attitude flights to effectively saw off hundreds of enemy soldiers .
When the pilot got above some Nazi crowd the pilot of started fire , then the doors in the plane ’s bottom were opened and this Fire Hedgehog was coming into play , eighty something non-stop firing machine guns could really look like the Hedgehog from Hell .
GoboLinux is a distribution which sports a different file system structure than ‘ ordinary ’ Linux distributions .
In order to remain compatible with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard , symbolic links are used to map the GoboLinux tree to standard UNIX directories .
A post in the GoboLinux forums suggested that it might be better to turn the concept around : retain the FHS , and then use symbolic links to map the GoboLinux tree on top of it .
This sparked some interesting discussion .
Read on for more details .
As the poster explains : “ Gobolinux tries to replace the legacy layout , instead of going the way of stacked layouts , giving us yet another standard layout , as if its underlying reasons were superior than FHS ’ .
I think they ’re not . ”
The reasons behind supporting the FHS is that it makes it easier for programs to find libraries and other files in standard locations .
“ FHS ’s goal is to allow apps to find their files and other apps ’ files and libraries in a portable way among Unix systems .
It ’s a _functional_ layout aimed at portability and interoperability . ”
Several people chimed in to explain that the FHS does not , in fact , provide the confidence of finding files in expected locations .
As user Shevegen explains :
There is no real confidence .
Why do some programs have directories under /etc and others do not ?
It makes no sense .
Why did the FHS make an exception for X11R6 in /usr ?
Why does there even exist any /usr or /usr / local debate WHILE keeping the / opt distinction ?
Why am I forced to keep the distinction of / bin vs. / sbin ?
Do I need to use the FHS suggested way for / boot ?
What If i choose to use only one partition anyway and if I am the sole user of my system where in an extreme case I would not even need ANY new user at all ?
It is a layer of ugliness upon ugliness .
Shevegen notes several other problems with FSH , such as the inability to run different versions of the same program side - by - side .
“ One huge problem of the FHS is that it does not easily allow one to have multiple versions of a program installed .
This is what has lead to the whole .
so. 1.2.3 mess as well , ” he explains , “ It is a reason why on a typical Debian system one finds a NEW symlink called ruby under /usr / bin which points to a ruby 1.8 symlink ( or vice versa ) .
If one compiles ruby from source , he does not get any such arbitrary symlinks . ”
Personally , I have invested time in coming up with more elegant ways to organise file systems too , but seeing I ’m not a programmer , my work is of the theoretical and conceptual nature .
The reason I have issues with the FHS has to do with the fact that is simply unclear .
One directory is supposed to be for files of type xyz , but exceptions are made all over the place , and to make it even more fun , different distributions have different exceptions , but in the end , all still comply with the FHS .
It is a god -awful mess .
The three letter directory names in UNIX - like operating systems are a relic of the past that should have died out and rotten away a long time ago .
Us Linux , BSD , and ( yes ) Mac OS X users are still stuck with a system that predates the coming of Christ , and the only reason we still have it is because people are too afraid to make the big step and come up with something that is – in every possible way – better than the FHS , but still compatible .
In a very brave and commendable effort , GoboLinux has done just that , but instead of being praised for bringing the filesystem structure of Linux systems to an acceptable , modern level , they get ridiculed and frowned upon as if they are some sort of heretics .
To me , it is absolutely mind - boggling that distributions like openSUSE , Fedora , and Ubuntu call themselves “ user - friendly ” while still maintaining a directory structure that requires a degree in computer history to even remotely understand – including all its exceptions and quirks .
In many ways , the FHS resembles my native language , Dutch .
Dutch in and of itself is n’t a particularly difficult language – it has a lot in common with both English and German , yet foreigners from both these countries have extreme difficulties in learning Dutch .
Those difficulties stem from a very simple fact :
Dutch is so difficult because it contains more exceptions than rules .
Sure , Dutch has a set of clear rules , but each of those rules has dozens of exceptions , and those exceptions have exceptions , and then those have exceptions that in fact make them look conforming to the original rule , but in fact do n’t .
There ’s a reason why I write more comfortably in English ( almost ) than I do in Dutch .
Getting back to the original discussion , the idea of using symbolic links to ‘ cover up ’ the original FHS is a clear - cut case of band - aid fever : it more or less admits the FHS is not very user friendly , but instead of actually fixing it , it just hides it for a while .
In many cheesy movies and TV shows , you see cheating husbands flip over any photographs they might have of their wives .
While this may postpone the feelings of guilt for a short while , it does n’t actually make them go away for ever .
Using symlinks to hide the FSH is like flipping over that picture of your wife .
Or , as Shevegen illustrates :
I simply think the whole Linux world as such is like digging a tunnel in a mountain .
One day you realize the tunnel is in the wrong direction , and water breaks into the tunnel , but making a change to the direction of the tunnel requires too much effort so you dig and dig and dig and use cheaper materials to stabilize the tunnel quicker , in order to grow it faster .
You make more mistakes this way , but you cant change anymore , you dig faster and faster and faster .

You ’ll see a long list of configuration entries .
If you ’re looking for a specific one , type its name into the “ Search ” bar above the list .
To toggle different features on and off , simply double - click their entries under the “ Value ” column to switch between “ true ” and “ false . ”
In some cases the value field will have a number instead .
In this case change the number to the one that corresponds to what you want .
( Do n’t mess around with these numbers until you know what you ’re doing ! )
Now , let ’s get tweaking .
Note : to undo specific changes you make in about : config , just right - click the entry you want to revert and click “ Reset . ”
1. Change Number of Content Processes
Do you like to work with a lot of tabs open at any one time , or do you rarely have more than , say , 5 tabs open ?
The more content processes you have , the more CPU resources will be assigned to each tab ( which will also use more RAM ) .
If you have a powerful PC , then you can set this at a reasonably high number , which should improve the stability and performance of each open tab in Firefox .
The name of this setting in about : config is dom.ipc.processCount
Default value : 4
Modified value : 7 - 12 ( depending on number of tabs you usually have open )
2. Disable Unnecessary Animations
Animations in Firefox Quantum are not a bad thing , but if you have an old PC where every MB of RAM counts or simply do n’t need these animated flourishes , you can disable them by going to toolkit .
cosmeticAnimations.enabled and setting the value to “ false . ”
Default value : true
Modified value : false
3. Change Minimum Tab Width
It will take a more sharp - eyed Firefox user to notice this adjustment Mozilla made for Firefox Quantum .
The default tab width is now just 76 pixels , whereas before it was 100 .
To adjust this , go to browser.tabs.tabMinWidth .
Default value : 76
Modified value : 100 if you want the same tab width as in older versions of Firefox , but really you can make this whatever you like .
Just do n’t go overboard !
4. Reduce Session History Cache , Save RAM
If you ’re using an older machine , then even the typically speedy Firefox may slow down your PC with the default settings .
This could be in part because of how it stores
Web pages in its short - term memory ( or RAM ) , which you can access using the Back and Forward buttons .
The preference browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers affects how many pages Firefox stores in such a way that they load super fast .
Default value : – 1 ( adaptable )
Modified value : any number , reflecting the number of pages you want to store .
( We recommend less than 4 if your PC is struggling for speed , while those with 4GB plus can go for 8 or more . )
The preference browser . sessionhistory .
max_entries affects how many pages each tab stores in its Back / Forward history altogether .
Default value : 50
Modified value :
If your PC is struggling , lower this to 25 , check if it helps , then adjust accordingly .
5. Disable Extension Compatibility Checks
Compatibility checks .
Who needs ’em , right ?
Actually they ’re pretty handy as a general reference of which extensions will work with your version of Firefox and which wo n’t , but Firefox does n’t always get it right .
If you want to see whether an extension that Firefox claims is incompatible may actually work , do the following :
Right - click anywhere on the about : config page , then click “ New -> Boolean ”
Type extensions.checkCompatibility into the box , click OK , then select “ false ” and click OK again .
into the box , click OK , then select “ false ” and click OK again .
This preference will now exist in your list , and you can disable it at any time by right - clicking it and clicking “ Reset . ”
6. Change Firefox Download Location
By default , Firefox downloads go to the Windows “ Downloads ” folder , but you can change this by tweaking browser.download.folderList
Default value : 1
Modified values :
0 – Saves all downloads to the desktop
2 – Saves to the same location as the previous download
7. Get Asked Where You Want Each Download Saved
If you want to have more direct control over your downloads and decide what directory you want each one to be saved in , change the preference browser.download.useDownloadDir to “ false . ”
Default value : true
Modified value : false – prompts you where to save each download
8. Open New Tab for Search Box Results
By default , the things you search for in the Firefox search box open in the current tab .
To open in a new tab instead , you ’ll need to modify browser.search.openintab
Default value : false – opens search results in current tab
Modified value : true – opens search results in new tab
9. New Tabs Page
Firefox ’s New Tabs page organizes all the sites you ’ve bookmarked and are most likely to visit in a convenient grid .
Best of all , you can tweak how big this grid is , so while it uses 3× 3 thumbnails by default , you can change it thanks to the browser.newtabpage.rows and browser.newtabpage.columns preferences .
Default value : 3 in “ rows , ” 5 in “ columns ”
Modified values :
Whatever number you like !
10 . Adjust the Smart Location Bar ’s Number of Suggestions
In Firefox when you start typing in the location ( or URL ) bar , a dropdown list of suggested sites will be shown .
If you want it to show more ( or less ) than ten suggestions , you can adjust the browser.urlbar.maxRichResults keys and get it to show the number you want .
Default value : 10
Modified value :
Set to your desired number of suggestions .
If you want to disable it altogether , set it to - 1 .
11 . Adjust the Session Restore Saving Frequency
Firefox saves your session every fifteen seconds by default , but you can change the value of browser .
sessionstore .
interval so that Firefox will save the session at a longer interval .
Default : 15000 ( in msecs , equivalent to fifteen seconds )
Modified value :
Set it to your desired value .
1000 means one sec , and 60000 means one minute
12 . Extend Scripts ’ Execution Time
In Firefox a script is only given ten seconds to respond , after which it will issue an unresponsive script warning .
If you are stuck on a slow network connection , you might want to increase the script execution time via dom.max_script_run_time to cut down on the frequency of the no-script warning .
Default value : 10 ( in secs )
Modified value : 20 , or any value greater than 10
13 . Handling JavaScript Popups
When you come across a site that executes a javascript , open a new window function , and if the popup window is without all the usual window features , e.g. back / forward / reload buttons , status bar , etc. , Firefox will automatically treat it as a popup and will not open it as a new tab .
However , if you find this to be a nuisance and want to open all new windows in new tabs , you can specify it via the browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction setting .
Default value : 2 – Open all JavaScript windows the same way you have Firefox handle new windows unless the JavaScript call specifies how to display the window
Modified values :
0 – open all links the way you have Firefox handle new windows
1 – do not open any new windows
2 – open all links the way you have Firefox handle new windows unless Javascript specifies how to display the window
14 . Enable Spell - Checking in All Text Fields
The default spell - checking function only checks for multi-line text boxes .
You can change the option in layout .
spellcheckDefault to get it to spell - check for single line text boxes as well .
Default value : 1 ( spellcheck for multi- line text boxes only )
Modified values :
0 – disable spellcheck
2 – enable spell - check for all text boxes
15 . Lower Memory Usage When Minimized
This tweak is mainly for Windows users .
When you minimize Firefox , it will send Firefox to your virtual memory and free up your physical memory for other programs to use .
Firefox will reduce its physical memory usage , when minimized , to approximately 10 MB ( give or take some ) , and when you maximize Firefox it will take back the memory that it needs .
The preference name does not exist and needs to be created .
Right - click on the background and select “ New -> Boolean . ”
Enter the name when prompted : config.trim_on_minimize
Enter the value : True
16 . Increase / Decrease the Amount of Disk Cache
When a page is loaded , Firefox will cache it into the hard disk so that it does n’t need to be downloaded again the next time it is loaded .
The bigger the storage size you cater for Firefox , the more pages it can cache .
Before you increase the disk cache size , make sure that browser.cache.disk.enable is set to “ True . ”
Config name : browser.cache.disk.capacity
Default value : 50000 ( in KB )
Modified value :
0 – disable disk caching
Any value lower than 50000 reduces the disk cache
Any value higher than 50000 increases the disk cache
17 . Select All Text When You Click on the URL Bar
In Windows and Mac Firefox highlights all text when you click on the URL bar .
In Linux it does not select all the text .
Instead , it places the cursor at the insertion point .
Regardless of which platform you are using , you can tweak browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll to either select all or place the cursor at the insertion point .
Modified value :
False – place cursor at the insertion point
True – select all text when you click
18 . Same Zoom Level for Every Site
Firefox remembers your zoom preference for each site and sets it to your preferences whenever you load the page .
If you want the zoom level to be consistent from site to site , you can toggle the value of browser .
zoom.
siteSpecific from “ True ” to “ False . ”
Default value : True
Modified value : False ( enable same zoom preferences for every site )
19 . Setting Your Zoom Limit
If you find that the max / min zoom level is still not sufficient for your viewing , you can change the zoom limit to suit your viewing habits .
Config name : zoom.
maxPercent
Default value : 300 ( percent )
Modified value : any value higher than 300
Config name : zoom.minPercent
Default value : 30 ( percent )
Modified value : any value
20 . Configure Your Backspace Button
In Firefox you can set your backspace by getting it to either go back to the previous page or scroll up a page if it ’s a scrolling site .
Holding
Shift as a modifier will go forward a page if the value is set to 0 and scroll down if the value is set to 1 .
Config name : browser.backspace_action
Default value : 0 – goes back a page
Modified value : 1 – scrolls up a page
21 . Increase Offline Cache
If you do not have access to the Internet most of the time , you might want to increase the offline cache so that you can continue to work offline .
By default , Firefox caches 500MB of data from supported offline web apps .
You can change that value to any amount you like .
Config name : browser.cache.offline.capacity
Default value : 512000 ( in KB )
Modified value : any value higher than 512000 will increase the cache value
22 . Disable Delay Time When Installing Add-ons
Every time you install a Firefox add - on , you will have to wait for several seconds before the actual installation starts .
To cut down on this waiting time , you can turn the preference security.dialog_enable_delay off so that the installation will begin immediately .
Default value : 1000 ( in msec )
Modified value :
0 – starts installation immediately
any other value ( in msec )
23 . View Source in Your Favorite Editor
This is very useful for developers who are always using the “ view source ” function .
This tweak allows you to view the source code of a given website in an external editor .
There are two configurations that need to be made :
Config name : view_source.editor.external
Default value : False
Modified value : True ( enable view source using external text editor )
Config name : view_source.editor.path
Default value : blank
Modified value : insert the file path to your editor here
24 . Increasing “ Save Link As ” Timeout Value
When you right - click and select “ Save Link As … ” the browser will request the content disposition header from the URL to determine the filename .
If the URL does not deliver the header within one second , Firefox will issue a timeout value .
This could happen very frequently in a slow network connection environment .
To prevent this issue from happening frequently , you can increase the timeout value to reduce the possibility of a timeout by editing Browser .
download.saveLinkAsFilenameTimeout
Default value : 4000 ( 4 seconds )
Modified value : any value higher than 1000 ( value is in msec )
25 . Autohide Toolbar in Fullscreen Mode
In fullscreen mode the toolbar is set to autohide and appear only when you hover over it with your mouse .
If you want , you can choose to have it visible all the time instead by toggling the value of browser.fullscreen.autohide to “ False ” to always show the toolbar .
Default value : True ( always autohide )
Modified value : False ( always show the toolbar )
26 . Increase Add-on Search Result
If you go to “ Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add- ons ” and perform a search , Firefox will display fifteen matching results .
If you want more or less results here , you can adjust extensions.getAddons.maxResults
Default value : 15
Modified value : more or less than 15
Conclusion
The Firefox about : config section provides a powerful way for users to fully customize the browser .
The above list is definitely not the complete list .
There are tons of tricks that you can do .
If you have any tricks not listed here , please add them in the comments .
This article was first published in 2008 and was updated in March 2019 .
In this online article Dr. Gunther digs down into the UNIX kernel to find out how load averages ( the “ LA Triplets ” ) are calculated and how appropriate they are as capacity planning metrics .
With apologies to Jules Verne and his novel “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , ” I might equally have entitled this piece , “ 20,000 Lines Under the Shell . ”
Have you ever wondered how those three little numbers that appear in the UNIX ® load average ( LA ) report are calculated ?
This TeamQuest paper explains how and how the load average ( LA ) can be reorganized to do better capacity planning .
But first , try testing your knowledge with the “ LA Triplets ” Quiz .
In this two part - series I want to explore the use of averages in performance analysis and capacity planning .
There are many manifestations of averages e.g. , arithmetic average ( the usual one ) , moving average ( often used in financial planning ) , geometric average ( used in the SPEC CPU benchmarks ) , harmonic average ( not used enough ) , to name a few .
More importantly , we will be looking at averages over time or time - dependent averages .
A particular example of such a time - dependent average is the load average metric that appears in certain UNIX commands .
In Part 1 I shall look at what the load average is and how it gets calculated .
In Part 2 I ’ll compare it with other averaging techniques as they apply in capacity planning and performance analysis .
This article does not assume you are a familiar with UNIX commands , so I will begin by reviewing those commands which display the load average metric .
By Section 4 , however , I ’ll be submerging into the UNIX kernel code that does all the work .
1. UNIX Commands
Actually , load average is not a UNIX command in the conventional sense .
Rather it ’s an embedded metric that appears in the output of other UNIX commands like uptime and procinfo .
These commands are commonly used by UNIX sysadmin’s to observe system resource consumption .
Let ’s look at some of them in more detail .
1.1 Classic Output
The generic ASCII textual format appears in a variety of UNIX shell commands .
Here are some common examples .
Uptime
The uptime shell command produces the following output :
[ pax : ~ ] % procinfo
9:40 am up 9 days , 10:36 , 4 users , load average : 0.02 , 0.01 , 0.00
It shows the time since the system was last booted , the number of active user processes and something called the load average .
Procinfo
On Linux systems , the procinfo command produces the following output :
[ pax : ~ ] % procinfo
Linux 2.0.36 ( root@pax ) ( gcc 2.7.2.3 ) # 1 Wed Jul 25 21:40:16 EST 2001 [ pax ]
Memory : Total Used Free Shared Buffers Cached
Mem : 95564 90252 5312 31412 33104 26412
Swap : 68508 0 68508
Bootup : Sun Jul 21 15:21:15 2002 Load average : 0.15 0.03 0.01 2/58 8557
...
The load average appears in the lower left corner of this output .
W
The w ( ho ) command produces the following output :
[ pax : ~ ] % w
9:40 am up 9 days , 10:35 , 4 users , load average : 0.02 , 0.01 , 0.00
USER TTY FROM LOGIN@ IDLE JCPU PCPU WHAT
mir ttyp0 :0.0 Fri10 pm 3days 0.09s 0.09s bash
neil ttyp2 12-35-86-1.ea.co 9:40 am 0.00s 0.29s 0.15s w
...
Notice that the first line of the output is identical to the output of the uptime command .
Top
The top command is a more recent addition to the UNIX command set that ranks processes according to the amount of CPU time they consume .
It produces the following output :
4:09 am up 12:48 , 1 user , load average : 0.02 , 0.27 , 0.17
58 processes : 57 sleeping , 1 running , 0 zombie , 0 stopped
CPU states : 0.5 % user , 0.9 % system , 0.0 % nice , 98.5 % idle
Mem : 95564 K av , 78704 K used , 16860 K free , 32836 K shrd , 40132 K buff
Swap : 68508 K av , 0 K used , 68508 K free , 14508K cched
PID USER PRI NI SIZE RSS SHARE STAT LIB %CPU %MEM TIME COMMAND
5909 neil 13 0 720 720 552 R 0 1.5 0.7 0.01 top
1 root 0 0 396 396 328 S 0 0.0 0.4 0.02 init
2 root 0 0 0 0 0 SW 0 0.0 0.0 0.00 kflushd
3 root - 12 - 12 0 0 0 SW < 0 0.0 0.0 0.00 kswapd
…
In each of these commands , note that there are three numbers reported as part of the load average output .
Quite commonly , these numbers show a descending order from left to right .
Occasionally , however , an ascending order appears e.g. , like that shown in the top output above .
1.2 GUI Output
The load average can also be displayed as a time series like that shown here in some output from a tool called ORCA .
Although such visual aids help us to see that the green curve is more spikey and has more variability than the red curve , and it allows us to see a complete day ’s worth of data , it ’s not clear how useful this is for capacity planning or performance analysis .
We need to understand more about how the load average metric is defined and calculated .
2 . So what is it ?
So , exactly what is this thing called load average that is reported by all these various commands ?
Let ’s look at the official UNIX documentation .
2.1 The man Page
[ pax : ~ ] % man “ load average ”
No manual entry for load average
Oops !
There is no man page !
The load average metric is an output embedded in other commands so it does n’t get its own man entry .
Alright , let ’s look at the man page for uptime , for example , and see if we can learn more that way .
...
DESCRIPTION
uptime gives a one line display of the following information .
The current time , how
long the system has been running , how many users are currently logged on , and the
system load averages for the past 1 , 5 , and 15 minutes .
...
So , that explains the three metrics .
They are the “ ... load averages for the past 1 , 5 , and 15 minutes . ”
Which are the GREEN , BLUE and RED curves , respectively , in Figure 1 above .
Unfortunately , that still begs the question “ What is the load ?
2.2 What the Gurus Have to Say
Let ’s turn to some UNIX hot - shots for more enlightenment .
Tim O’Reilly and Crew
The book UNIX Power Tools [ POL97 ] , tell us on p.726 The CPU :
The load average tries to measure the number of active processes at any time .
As a measure of CPU utilization , the load average is simplistic , poorly defined , but far from useless .
That ’s encouraging !
Anyway , it does help to explain what is being measured : the number of active processes .
On p.720 39.07 Checking System Load : uptime it continues ...
...
High load averages usually mean that the system is being used heavily and the response
time is correspondingly slow .
What ’s high ? ...
Ideally , you ’d like a load average under , say , 3 , ...
Ultimately , ‘ high ’ means high enough so that you do n’t need uptime to tell you that the system is overloaded .
Hmmm ... where did that number “ 3 ” come from ?
And which of the three averages ( 1 , 5 , 15 minutes ) are they referring to ?
Adrian Cockcroft on Solaris
In Sun Performance and Tuning [ Coc95 ] in the section on p.97 entitled : Understanding and Using the Load Average , Adrian Cockcroft states :
The load average is the sum of the run queue length and the number of jobs currently running on the CPUs .
In Solaris 2.0 and 2.2 the load average did not include the running jobs but this bug was fixed in Solaris 2.3 .
So , even the “ big boys ” at Sun can get it wrong .
Nonetheless , the idea that the load average is associated with the CPU run queue is an important point .
O’Reilly et al. also note some potential gotchas with using load average ...
... different systems will behave differently under the same load average .
... running a single cpu-bound background job .... can bring response to a crawl even though the load avg remains quite low .
As I will demonstrate , this depends on when you look .
If the CPU - bound process runs long enough , it will drive the load average up because its always either running or runable .
The obscurities stem from the fact that the load average is not your average kind of average .
As we alluded to in the above introduction , it ’s a time - dependentaverage .
Not only that , but it ’s a damped time - dependent average .
To find out more , let ’s do some controlled experiments .
3. Performance Experiments
The experiments described in this section involved running some workloads in background on single - CPU Linux box .
There were two phases in the test which has a duration of 1 hour :
CPU was pegged for 2100 seconds and then the processes were killed .
CPU was quiescent for the remaining 1500 seconds .
A Perl script sampled the load average every 5 minutes using the uptime command .
Here are the details .
3.1 Test Load
Two hot - loops were fired up as background tasks on a single CPU Linux box .
There were two phases in the test :
The CPU is pegged by these tasks for 2,100 seconds .
The CPU is ( relatively ) quiescent for the remaining 1,500 seconds .
The 1 - minute average reaches a value of 2 around 300 seconds into the test .
The 5 - minute average reaches 2 around 1,200 seconds into the test and the 15 - minute average would reach 2 at around 3,600 seconds but the processes are killed after 35 minutes ( i.e. , 2,100 seconds ) .
3.2 Process Sampling
As the authors [ BC01 ] explain about the Linux kernel , because both of our test processes are CPU - bound they will be in a TASK_RUNNING state .
This means they are either :
running i.e. , currently executing on the CPU
runnable i.e. , waiting in the run_queue for the CPU
The Linux kernel also checks to see if there are any tasks in a short - term sleep state called TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE .
If there are , they are also included in the load average sample .
There were none in our test load .
The following source fragment reveals more details about how this is done .
600 * Nr of active tasks - counted in fixed - point numbers
601 */
602 static unsigned long count_active_tasks ( void )
603 {
604 struct task struct *p ;
605 unsigned long nr = 0 ;
606
607 read_lock ( &tasklist_lock ) ;
608 for_each_task(p ) {
609 if ( ( p-> state == TASK_RUNNING | |
610 ( p-> state & TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE ) ) )
611 nr += FIXED_1 ;
612 }
613 read_unlock ( &tasklist_lock ) ;
614 return nr ;
615 }
So , uptime is sampled every 5 seconds which is the linux kernel ’s intrinsic timebase for updating the load average calculations .
3.3 Test Results
The results of these experiments are plotted in Fig. 2 . NOTE :
These colors do not correspond to those used in the ORCA plots like Figure 1 .
Although the workload starts up instantaneously and is abruptly stopped later at 2100 seconds , the load average values have to catch up with the instantaneous state .
The 1 - minute samples track the most quickly while the 15 - minute samples lag the furthest .
You would be forgiven for jumping to the conclusion that the “ load ” is the same thing as the CPU utilization .
As the Linux results show , when two hot processes are running , the maximum load is two ( not one ) on a single CPU .
So , load is not equivalent to CPU utilization .
From another perspective , Fig. 2 resembles the charging and discharging of a capacitive RC circuit .
4. Kernal Magic
Now let ’s go inside the Linux kernel and see what it is doing to generate these load average numbers .
unsigned long avenrun [ 3 ] ;
624
625 static inline void calc_load ( unsigned long ticks )
626 {
627 unsigned long active_tasks ; /* fixed - point */
628 static int count = LOAD_FREQ ;
629
630 count -= ticks ;
631 if ( count > 0 ) {
632 count += LOAD_FREQ ;
633 active_tasks = count_active_tasks ( ) ;
634 CALC_LOAD ( avenrun[0 ] , EXP_1 , active_tasks ) ;
635 CALC_LOAD ( avenrun [ 1 ] , EXP_5 , active_tasks ) ;
636 CALC_LOAD ( avenrun [ 2 ] , EXP_15 , active_tasks ) ;
637 }
638 }
The countdown is over a LOAD_FREQ of 5 HZ .
How often is that ?
1 HZ = 100 ticks
5 HZ = 500 ticks
1 tick = 10 miliseconds
500 ticks = 5000 miliseconds ( or 5 seconds )
So , 5 HZ means that CALC_LOAD is called every 5 seconds .
4.1 Magic Numbers
The function CALC_LOAD is a macro defined in sched .h
58 extern unsigned long avenrun [ ] ; /* Load averages */
59
60 #define FSHIFT 11 /* nr of bits of precision */
61 #define FIXED_1 ( 1<< FSHIFT ) /* 1.0 as fixed - point */
62 #define LOAD_FREQ ( 5* HZ ) /* 5 sec intervals */
63 #define EXP_1 1884 /* 1 / ex p ( 5sec /1 min ) as fixed - point */
64 #define EXP_5 2014 /* 1/exp(5sec/5min ) */
65 #define EXP_15 2037 /* 1/exp(5sec/15min ) */
66
67 # define CALC_LOAD ( load , exp , n ) \
68 load *= exp ; \
69 load += n*( FIXED_1 -exp ) ; \
70 load >>=
FSHIFT ;
A notable curiosity is the appearance of those magic numbers : 1884 , 2014 , 2037 .
What do they mean ?
If we look at the preamble to the code we learn ,
/*
49 * These are the constant used to fake the fixed - point load - average
50 * counting .
Some notes :
51 * — 11 bit fractions expand to 22 bits by the multiplies ; this gives a
52 * load - average precision of 10 bits integer + 11 bits fractional
53 * — if you want to count load - averages more often , you need more
54 * precision , or rounding will get you .
With 2 - second counting freq ,
55 * the EXP_n values would be 1981 , 2034 and 2043 if still using only
56 * 11 bit fractions .
57 */
These magic numbers are a result of using a fixed - point ( rather than a floating - point ) representation .
Using the 1 minute sampling as an example , the conversion of exp ( 5/60 ) into base - 2 with 11 bits of precision occurs like this :
These numbers are in complete agreement with those mentioned in the kernel comments above .
The fixed - point representation is used presumably for efficiency reasons since these calculations are performed in kernel space rather than user space .
One question still remains , however .
Where do the ratios like exp ( 5/60 ) come from ?
4.2 Magic Revealed
Taking the 1 - minute average as the example , CALC_LOAD is identical to the mathematical expression :
load ( t ) = load( t - 1 ) e-5/60 + n ( 1 - e-5/60 ) ( 3 )
If we consider the case n = 0 , eqn . ( 3 ) becomes simply :
load ( t ) = load ( t - 1 ) e-5/60 ( 4 )
If we iterate eqn . ( 4 ) , between t = t0 and t = T we get :
load(t T ) = load(t 0 ) e-5t/60 ( 5 )
which is pure exponential decay , just as we see in Fig. 2 for times between t 0 = 2100 and t T = 3600 .
Conversely , when n = 2 as it was in our experiments , the load average is dominated by the second term such that :
load(t T ) = 2 load(t 0 ) ( 1 - e-5t/60 ) ( 6 )
which is a monotonically increasing function just like that in Fig. 2 between t 0 = 0 and t T = 2100 .
5. Summary
So , what have we learned ?
Those three innocuous looking numbers in the LA triplet have a surprising amount of depth behind them .
The triplet is intended to provide you with some kind of information about how much work has been done on the system in the recent past ( 1 minute ) , the past ( 5 minutes ) and the distant past ( 15 minutes ) .
As you will have discovered if you tried the LA Triplets quiz , there are problems :
The “ load ” is not the utilization but the total queue length .

ELYRIA , Ohio ( AP ) 
A judge in Ohio says the state 's method of putting prisoners to death is unconstitutional because two of three drugs used in the lethal injection process can cause pain .
Lorain County Common Pleas Judge James Burge said Tuesday the state 's lethal injection procedure does n't provide the quick and painless death required by Ohio law .
Burge said Ohio must stop allowing a combination of drugs and focus instead on a single , anesthetic drug .
The ruling is likely be appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court .
Ohio has executed 26 inmates since it resumed putting prisoners to death in 1999 .

WASHINGTON
Karl Rove was impressed with Barack Obama when he first met him .
But now he sees him as a “ coolly arrogant ” elitist .
This was Rove ’s take on Obama to Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club Monday , according to Christianne Klein of ABC News :
“ Even if you never met him , you know this guy .
He ’s the guy at the country club with the beautiful date , holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by . ”
Actually , that sounds more like W .
The cheap populism is really rich coming from Karl Rove .
When was the last time he kicked back with a corncob pipe to watch professional wrestling ?
Rove is trying to spin his myths , as he used to do with such devastating effect , but it wo n’t work this time .
The absurd spectacle of rich white conservatives trying to paint Obama as a watercress sandwich with the crust cut off seems ugly and fake .
In his August 4 , 2008 column in the liberal Arab e-journal Elaph , Saudi columnist Saleh Al - Rashed argued that the Gulf states should urge the West to attack Iran before it acquires nuclear weapons .
Following are excerpts from the column : [ 1 ]
A Nuclear Iran is Like a Nuclear Bin Laden
" ' There 's no avoiding what there 's no avoiding ' – this adage came to mind when I read the pronouncement by Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Mohammad ' Ali Ja'fari , who said : ' My country is easily capable of closing the Straits of Hormuz , the main passageway for oil freighters , if the country is attacked due to its nuclear program . '
" In my estimation , confronting this country , which is trying to gain the time necessary to acquire nuclear weapons , is unavoidable .
The possession of nuclear weapons by a state like Iran , which is ideological to the core , is more or less like Osama bin Laden having a nuclear bomb .
They are two of a kind .
Despite the difference in their turbans and in their religious beliefs , the end result is the same .
" Perhaps it is our bad luck that we [ i.e. Saudi Arabia ] and the Gulf states would be the first to suffer from a military confrontation with Iran and from its response , and the problem would become even more grave if Iran succeeded in closing the Straits of Hormuz , as the IRGC commander threatened .
But our situation with Iran is like that of the sick man who refuses to have his illness treated with cauterization .
Yes , the pain of the burning is horrible , but this malady can only be treated through this military confrontation –cauterization .
" History has taught us that ideological countries only pay heed to victory over their ideology …
They never accept any halfway situation , even when they find themselves on the brink of disaster . "
" Confrontation Is The Solution " ; " The Absolute Priority Must Be Our Strategic Security in the Gulf "
" Confrontation is the solution , and there is no solution but confrontation .
The game of the carrot and the stick played by the U.S. and E.U. will be to no avail .
" At present , we are suffering from two things : Iran 's attempts [ to gain ] regional hegemony , and its attempts to impose its influence via its sectarian allies – the fifth column of Arab Shi'ite fundamentalists .
Imagine what Iran 's influence , hegemony , and fifth column would be like if Iran had a nuclear bomb .
" Perhaps it is a strange coincidence that , this time around , our strategic interests coincide with those of Israel .
The regime of the mullahs in Iran is our enemy , and at the same time it is an enemy not just of Israel , but of world peace and security .
" I know that the Arab demagogues stand together indiscriminately with anyone who is against Israel and America .
But we need to not be swept away by these demagogues as we were in the past .
This time , the absolute priority must be our strategic security in the Gulf , which is threatened by Iran – even if this comes at the expense of the Palestinian cause .
" In politics , nothing prevents you from allying with the devil for the sake of your interests .
This is what confronting the Iranian danger – which is close – demands of us .
This issue , in my estimation , cannot suffer delay or hesitation .
Every passing day benefits Iran .
" Thus , we need to push the world powers , and especially the U.S. and the E.U. , towards military confrontation to neutralize the Iranian enemy , whatever the cost , before the nuclear bomb makes it too late – even if it is against the will of the Arabs of the north . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
An Iranian official in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Saturday that the producers group is considering leaving oil production levels unchanged or perhaps even trimming them to shore up flagging prices and defend market share .
" The market is oversupplied by at least 1 million barrels a day .
If OPEC would like to remove this additional oil out of the market , then OPEC has to cut some production , " OPEC governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi told Dow Jones in a telephone interview .
" There will be maybe two options .
One option is maintaining the level of production .
It means OPEC will roll over the production .
The other option will be some decrease in production , " he added .
The topic will lead OPEC 's agenda when representatives of the group 's 13 member nations gather Sept. 9 in Vienna to discuss production policy .
Oil prices peaked in early July at over $ 145 a barrel .
They have since fallen 22 % as the high prices carved deeply into demand , especially in the transport sector .
The September crude oil futures contract closed Friday at $ 113.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , a fresh three - month low .
See Futures Movers .
Khatibi's comments come just a day after OPEC said higher prices and weak economic conditions in most industrialized nations are slowing global oil demand .
" Summer strong oil demand growth in China , Middle East and Asia has not been enough to offset the huge decline in OECD oil demand in the second quarter , " the producers group said Friday in its monthly oil report .
The group 's latest estimate trims 2008 demand growth by 30,000 barrels per day -- its fifth consecutive month of downward revisions .
The group now estimates global oil demand this year will average 86.9 million bpd .
It sees demand inching up to 87.8 million bpd next year .
At the same time , the revised forecast sees oil demand from OPEC 's members slipping to 32.1 million bpd , or 100,000 bpd less than in 2007 .
The 2009 forecast extends the trend , with demand for OPEC oil easing to an average of 31.3 million bpd .
The drop is the result of slowing demand growth and oil coming into the market from newly developed fields in non-OPEC nations .
OPEC claims it has bumped up output to help calm the volatile oil market , pumping 32.64 million bpd in July , or 780,000 bpd more than in April .
The group 's monthly report also said OPEC is now producing " well above the demand for its crude . "
Why are we so interested in shipwrecks and other strange stories about underwater wonders of the world ?
The idea of ancient buried treasure , mysterious happenings , mystical pirate stories and awesome man-made underwater ecosystems all draw people toward mysteries , developments and disasters of the sea .
Shipwrecks are so engaging to us for so many reasons , but what are the most famous , most historical , and most amazing shipwrecks of all ?
Well , here are some of the most spectacular shipwrecks around the world .
( Guest author Andrew Boyd is an expert on travel hacks )
The Yongala Shipwreck [ The Great Barrier Reef , Australia ]
Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef is probably the most popular diving site in the world , and one of the most famous diving sites here is the S.S. Yongala wreck .
The Yongala sank in a cyclone about 100 years ago taking the lives of all on - board – 121 people in all .
Even after being submerged for so long , the Yongala is surprisingly well - preserved at its final resting place about 60 kilometers from Townsville in about 30 meters of water .
The exact location is marked with a buoy .
S.S. Thistlegorm [ Red Sea ]
The S.S. Thistlegorm was a British Merchant Navy ship that was sunk by a German bomb in 1941 as it carried guns , bombs , and ammunition on its way to Alexandria .
The wreck was discovered by Jacques Cousteau in 1956 and has since become one of the most popular dive sites in the world .
The wreck is located about 30 meters beneath the surface of the Red Sea just off the coast of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula .
Divers can explore the the locomotives that were onboard at the time the Thistlegorm sank , the well - preserved guns and torpedos , various military vehicles that were being transported , and the location where the two 1,000 lb.
German bombs hit the ship and led to its demise .
The ‘ Black Swan ’ Dive Site [ Off the coast of Portugal ]
The so - called ‘ Black Swan ’ project involves the largest treasure ever discovered at sea .
A Florida - based company by the name of Odyssey Marine Exploration is a group of modern - day treasure hunters , and they discovered the richest shipwreck ever found off the coast of Portugal in the Atlantic .
Odyssey has been highly secretive about the exact location and the name of the shipwreck since they discovered it a few years back .
So far , they ’ve recovered 500,000 gold and silver coins worth approximately $ 254 million !
The government of Spain believes that this lost ship is the Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes , which was sunk by British war ships in 1804 along with 200 crew members .
A historical account of the Mercedes says that there were 4,436,519 gold and silver pesos on - board at the time of its demise .
This wreck led to Spain declaring war on Great Britain .
Spain is now trying to get a piece of the lost treasure which they claim should be in a museum , but Odyssey most likely will be able to keep the majority of the gold and silver found at this amazing shipwreck .
The Titanic [ North Atlantic Ocean ]
The Titanic is by far the most famous shipwreck of all time , which is in large part due to the popular movie released in the late 1990s .
The Titanic set off on her maiden voyage in April of 1912 with 2,227 passengers and crew , and a few days later struck an iceberg then sank about 350 miles southeast of Newfoundland , Canada .
In the wreck , 1,522 people were lost at sea .
The Titanic wreck was discovered in 1985 approximately 12,500 feet below the surface of the North Atlantic .
The wreck has been photographed by underwater remotely operated vehicles ; it ’s far too deep for scuba divers to dive here .
The mystique surrounding the legacy of the Titanic will live on forever as people continue to be fascinated by this tragic shipwreck .
Pearl Harbor Fleet of Ships [ Hawaii ]
The famous attack on a U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor claimed the lives of about 2,400 people and sparked the start of World War II for the United States .
Over 300 planes bombed the harbor area in a surprise attack in 1941 , and as you would expect , the wreckage was immense .
The Pearl Harbor attack wrecked five large Navy battleships , one minelayer , two destroyers , and damaged countless other Navy vessels and aircraft .
The most famous wreck at Pearl Harbor is the USS Arizona .
Today , a memorial stands at the site of the Arizona shipwreck where visitors can view the wreckage from a glass floor building built above the site .
The RMS Lusitania [ Queenstown , Ireland ]
This gigantic ocean liner left New York City enroute to Liverpool on May 1 , 1915 with nearly 2,000 passengers onboard .
Despite warnings of German U - boats in the area , captain William Turner pressed on hoping to avoid their threat and arrive safely in England .
However , the Lusitania was n’t so lucky .
It was struck by a German torpedo and consequently sank within 18 minutes of being hit .
The 785 foot long , 31,550 ton ship went down along with 1,195 passengers .
The wreck now lies in about 295 feet of water and stands as a mass graveyard to all who lost their lives that cold , foggy night .

PORTLAND — An Oregon man issued a series of parking citations to a uniformed police officer who parked his patrol car next to a " No Parking " sign while he went to buy food at a Chinese restaurant last month in Portland .
Eric Bryant says he approached Officer Chad Stensgaard , but the cop dismissed his concerns about the illegal parking spot .
" If he had acknowledged and corrected his error , we could have avoided this whole thing , " Bryant tells the Portland Mercury .
" But instead , he kept watching basketball and told me he was n't doing anything wrong . "
The paper says Bryant , a newly minted lawyer , used a section of state law that allows private citizens to issue citations .
He filed a complaint that accuses Stensgaard of illegal parking , illegal stopping , ignoring parking restrictions and illegal operation of an emergency vehicle .
The Associated Press says the officer was summoned to appear in traffic court next month .
If he 's convicted , Stensgaard faces more than $ 500 in fines .
Police officials say he did n't do anything wrong .
" I think asking an officer to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find a ' legal ' parking space that may be a long ways away from where they 're going is unreasonable , " Assistant Chief Brian Martinek tells KGW - TV .
In 2006 , Portland brought in $ 3.3 million from parking citations , according to this report .

Oath of allegiance to the Queen should be scrapped , say human rights campaigners
Republican groups claim the oath of allegiance to the Queen discriminates against religious groups
The historic oath of allegiance to the Queen sworn by MPs , judges , church leaders and police officers should be scrapped because it breaches human rights , campaigners say .
Republican groups claimed that refusing someone a job because they will not swear an oath to the monarch is unfair .
Foreigners hoping to gain British citizenship could also argue that their rights have been infringed if they are refused a passport because they will not make the pledge of allegiance .
Last week , the Mail revealed that a cross-party group of 22 MPs were campaigning to scrap their traditional oath of allegiance to the Queen .
Instead , they want the Commons and the Lords to be allowed to swear allegiance to their ' constituents and the nation ' .
Now the campaign group Republic is planning a legal challenge , saying the current rules discriminate against Catholics , Muslims , Sikhs and members of other religions who object to swearing allegiance to the head of the Church of England .
It also breaches the human rights of those who have ' firmly held beliefs ' against the monarchy , they say .
People should be able to replace the oath to the Queen , which dates back at least 500 years , to one to ' the country ' or ' the nation ' .
Republic is hoping to force a judicial review through a test case where a new MP , magistrate or other public official refuses to take the oath .
Their fight is being spearheaded by human rights lawyer Louise Christian , who said she believes the oath to the Queen could be challenged on the grounds that it no longer reflected the way the country was run .
Republic spokesman Graham Smith added : ' It is vital we challenge these offensive and discriminatory oaths of allegiance .
They are completely out of date . '
But Tory MP Douglas Carswell said human rights lawyers are trying to ' usurp the Queen ' .
The backbencher added : ' The Queen is a profoundly unifying force - no matter what your background , what your heritage , where your grandparents came from , we can all unite with her as our personal head of state . '
" In 2007 , Islandia produced 500 coconuts , which residents sold to themselves for $ 1 each , and imported 1 barrel of oil , which cost $ 100 .
The oil was paid for by borrowing from foreigners .
Ready to calculate GDP ?
We want the dollar value of domestically produced final goods and services , to wit , the dollar value of the 500 coconuts .
Got the answer ?
Very good .
Nominal GDP in Islandia for 2007 was $ 500 .
If you wanted to describe that in real terms , you 'd call it 500 coconuts .
You do n't count the oil in either nominal or real GDP because Islandia did n't produce any oil .
Here are the numbers for 2008 .
We grew 510 coconuts , sold them for $ 1.01 each , and still imported 1 barrel of oil , paying $ 125 for it .
So nominal GDP was $ 515.10 ( a 3 % increase ) and real GDP was 510 coconuts ( a 2 % increase ) .
The change in the implicit GDP deflator would be the change in the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP , namely , +1 % .
But wait a minute , Islandia 's pundits decry .
How can your crummy accounting claim that inflation was only 1 % ?
Last year we bought 500 coconuts and 1 barrel of oil for $ 600 , but this year if we tried to buy the same thing it would cost us $ 630 .
The inflation rate , they tell you , is obviously 5 % , not 1 % .
You must have intentionally cooked the books , they charge , just to make the economy appear better than it is ! "
value
in how much he can buy for it
After I posted a comment under a post by James Hamilton , it seems that the issue over terms of trade and what should be considered real GDP has finally started .
James Hamilton has commented the issue here , , anonymous blogger " knzn " commented the issue here and Brian Wesbury commented the issue here .
Hamilton 's fellow econbrowser blogger Menzie Chinn commented the issue here , but he really does n't argue for or against it and instead simply explained the difference between the production deflator and the purchases deflator .
I start with James Hamilton .
He use a " Crusoe " - island approach , which I kind of like .
However , as much as I like the approach , his conclusion is wrong .
As he wrote , what we want is theof domestic production .
But what value ?
Value is not intrinsic in the things we produce , value is value in terms of the things we want .
The value of a worker 's earnings does not lie in how many things he produce , but .
Saying that terms of trade is irrelevant for the value of domestic production is like saying that the relation between wage and consumer price levels is irrelevant for real weekly earnings of workers .
The logic behind the GDP deflator approach would thus imply that if a company executive tells workers that they 're going to have to accept a 90 % wage cut even as their cost of living is unchanged , they should n't mind because the workers will continue to work as hard and produce as many goods as before for the company and since their personal GDP deflator falls 90 % , the value of their wages are unchanged ( even though their nominal wage is down 90 % and their cost of living unchanged ) !
Similarly , a company executive could tell shareholders not to worry about the 50 % decline in revenues since that decline was entirely the result of reduced prices on the goods they sell , and since the company 's GDP deflator is down 50 % , revenues are n't really down at all !
Or similarly , supermarkets could raise prices by 50 % and tell customers that they should n't mind paying more because their wages ( their personal GDP deflator ) have n't been raised !
And suppliers to a company could similarly tell the company that they should n't object to paying more to them as long as they abstain from raising the price they charge their customers !
Or in the case of Islandia , those foreign oil producers could tell them that even though the world price is $ 125 , they should n't mind paying them $ 200 since that wo n't affect the GDP deflator and thus not reduce real GDP !
As for knzn , he takes a different approach and says that he does not care about the value of production .
Well , he is free to care or not to care about whatever he wants , butthe vast majority of people do care about the value of their income and that is why people laugh at Phil Gramm 's " mental recession " - remarks ( See here for a clip of how people spontaneously laugh when Obama tells them about those remarks ) that contradict their daily experience even as the official GDP statistics support Gramm .
Economists who want people to think that GDP is n't something laughable better care .
He continues by saying " Personally , I care a lot more about the people that do n’t have jobs , or potentially wo n’t have jobs in the future . "
But first of all , why then look at GDP numbers in the first place ?
Why not only look at employment numbers ?
And secondly , the employment numbers are far more consistent with the terms of trade adjusted GDP number as employment has been falling ( and would have fallen a lot more if not for the flawed " Birth / Death " model ) .
He then says that he cares more about productivity ( which he defines in unadjusted terms ) because that is supposedly more stable then terms of trade movements .
But even setting aside the fact that GDP is supposed to measure the value of production regardless of how stable or not certain aspects are , it is not true that productivity is particularly stable .
If you go to the Bureau of Labor statistics web site , you see that their measure of productivity ( non - farm business output per hour ) moves up and down in a quite erratic way .
In 2003 for example , productivity at an annualized rate rose by 5.6 % in the second quarter and 10.3 % in the third quarter only to fall by 0.4 % in the fourth quarter .
As for Brian Wesbury , who delivered the by far worst GDP forecast of all economists ( 3 % , even as he assumed a 3 % increase in the GDP deflator ! ) , he agrees that 1.1 % is a far too low inflation figure and notes like I did that if you deflate the nominal GDP increase with the domestic purchases deflator , real GDP declined .
However , he says that would be misleading and says that if you include import prices to calculate real GDP you must add imports to GDP , a sum he says increased more than 5 % .
But that does not follow .
What the domestic purchases price index include is first of all usually not directly import prices , but the prices of various forms of domestic demand , like private consumption , government consumption and business investments , and that is usually not the same even for imported goods , as the retail price of for example a sweater made in China includes the margins of the American retailer ( and often also wholesaler ) .
That means that including imports would double - count it .
However , as discussed above , the value of domestic production is determined ( partly ) by how much imported goods that domestic production can buy .
$ 10 says Mad Magazine or Cracked use that same title .
When I say that many of these comics are autobiographical , please believe me .
For not one , not two , but three of my friends approached me with roughly the same review of “ Tropic Thunder . ”
It just so happens they were the three featured regularly in HijiNKS Ensue .
I hope when I have lunch with them later today I might actually learn if they thought it was a good movie .
Eli said basically what I portrayed in the panels above .
He speaks in cryptic riddles and half truths .
I think I ’m supposed to find an amulet to decode what he tells me .
Denise was actually the one that suggested Eli might have been talking about “ unicorn vomit ” as opposed to his own , or someone else ’s .
Somehow , in her world , this suggests a shift from a negative connotation ( throwing up in your own mouth ) to a positive one ( finding that there is mythical horned horse vomit in your mouth ) .
As if the response to that discovery would be “ Mmm , delightful ! ”
Denise also proposed that “ Tropic Thunder ” was made by 12 year olds with access to high explosives .
Again , I think she meant this as a compliment to the film makers .
I ’m so confused .
REMINDER : We will be Castcasting the HE Podcast tonight starting between 8 pm and 9 pm Central .

“ Tropic Thunder ” sounds like a sports drink that might actually be “ enfused ” with unicorn vomit .

" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 11 - Changes to Perl 5 Operators
2015-02-26
# bitwise operators 5 +| 3 ; # 7 5 +^ 3 ; # 6 5 +& 3 ; # 1 " b " ~| " d " ; # 'f ' # string concatenation ' a ' ~ ' b ' ; # ' ab ' # file tests if '/etc/ passwd '.path ~~ :e { say " exists " } # repetition ' a ' x 3 ; # ' aaa ' ' a ' xx 3 ; # 'a ' , 'a ' , 'a ' # ternary , conditional op my ( $a , $ b ) = 2 , 2 ; say $ a == $ b ?? 2 * $ a !!
$ b - $ a ; # chained comparisons my $ angle = 1.41 ; if 0 <= $ angle < 2 * pi { ... }
All the numeric operators ( + , - , / , * , ** , % ) remain unchanged .
Since | , ^ and & now construct junctions , the bitwise operators have a changed syntax .
They now contain a context prefix , so for example +| is bit wise OR with numeric context , and ~^ is one 's complement on a string .
Bit shift operators changed in the same way , ie +< and +> .
String concatenation is now ~ , the dot .
is used for method calls .
File tests are now done by smart matching a path object against a simple Pair ; Perl 5 -e would now be $ _.path ~~ :e .
The repetition operator x is now split into two operators : x replicates strings , xx lists .
The ternary operator , formerly $ condition ?
$ true : $ false , is now spelled $ condition ??
$ true !!
$ false .
Comparison operators can now be chained , so you can write $ a < $ b < $c and it does what you mean .
Many changes to the operators aim at a better Huffman coding , ie give often used things short names ( like . for method calls ) and seldom used operators a longer name ( like ~& for string bit - wise AND ) .
The chaining comparison operators are another step towards making the language more natural , and allowing things that are commonly used in mathematical notation .

The Law Blog has been to Dawsonville , Georgia , the birthplace of NASCAR .
Heck , we even passed by the home of Bill Elliott ( " Awesome Bill from Dawsonville " ) while we were there .
But we 've yet to attend a NASCAR race .
Pole - sitter Kurt Busch leads Bill Elliott during practice for the NASCAR Sharp Aquos 500 auto race , Sept. 1 , 2007 , in Fontana , Calif .

We hope we make it to a race someday , but even if we do n't , we 're pleased about a recent Ninth Circuit ruling that means Robert Miller , and other disabled NASCAR fans , are entitled to an unimpeded view of the racetrack .
Here 's the NLJ story , and here 's the Ninth Circuit 's opinion by Judge Jay Bybee .
When Miller , a quadriplegic , purchased NASCAR tickets for races at the California Speedway , he always sat in one of the speedway 's two areas for wheelchairs , though he still had problems seeing the best parts of the races when fans in front of him sprung to their feet .
The court said that the California Speedway Corp. had violated Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act , and a DOJ interpretive rule requiring that wheelchair areas at auto racing and other public venues provide " lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public . "
The Ninth Circuit overturned a federal district court , which had granted summary judgment to the speedway , and , notes NLJ , added to a circuit split over the following issue :
Do the ADA rules merely require a line of sight for disabled fans when the spectators were in their seats or did they go further �requiring a line of sight for the disabled when the rest of the fans were standing ?
However , the issue may not make it to the High Court .
The DOJ has issued proposed new regulations , its ADA Standards for Accessible Design , which would , if approved by the Bush administration , codify the requirement of disabled seating with lines of sight above standing fans �in regulations promulgated after a rulemaking proceeding .

Listen to Gary Moskowitz interview Bruce Falconer .
In a warehouse on the outskirts of the rural Shenandoah Valley town of Fishersville , Virginia , it did n’t take long to spot what I was looking for .
There were plenty of guns lined up neatly on display tables , everything from Civil War - style muskets to handguns to hunting rifles , but I was in the market for something with a bit more firepower .
At a table near the entrance , I found it : a Chinese - made mak - 90 semiautomatic rifle , a variation of the Russian AK - 47 designed to circumvent federal regulations on the import of assault weapons .
“ It ’s the same gun , ” the dealer told me .
“ They just eliminated the pistol grip , replaced it with a threaded thumb grip , and took off the flash suppressor . ”
This particular model came with a five - round detachable clip , but the dealer assured me it would accept larger magazines , including a 75 - round “ ammunition drum . ”
He was uncomfortable trading in handguns , he said , explaining that “ there ’s too much controversy about them , ” but was willing to sell the mak - 90 to anyone with a valid ID and $ 450 .
The reemergence of imported assault rifles on the US market signals a dramatic shift in federal firearms policy .
By 1998 , four years after a federal ban on assault weapons took effect , gun manufacturers had easily managed to bypass the law by making small alterations to their weapons .
To close the loophole , the Clinton administration prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives from granting import permits for 58 types of assault weapons , adding to an import rule first put in place by George H.W. Bush .
These included dozens of AK - 47 variants and other high - powered semiautomatic rifles that could accept high - capacity magazines originally designed for military use .
But not only did the current Bush administration allow the 1994 assault weapons ban to lapse , it has also , through the atf , permitted gun manufacturers to game the import rules , effectively reopening American borders to foreign assault weapons .
While the import ban remains nominally in force , gun importers are now able to easily skirt it by assembling the guns in the US .
Describing the manufacturing process at Florida - based Century International Arms Incorporated , a leading importer of foreign assault weapons , an official in the atf ‘s firearms import branch told me “ they import the parts ” and combine them with US - made materials specifically prohibited by the import ban .
That way , technically speaking , the guns “ are made in this country , ” he said .
But according to Kristen Rand , the legislative director at the Violence Policy Center , a Washington - based gun control advocacy group , the atf is simply shirking its responsibility .
“ They ’ve created this Alice in Wonderland world , where if you take it apart and put it back together then it ’s no longer an import , but the end result is the same , ” she says .
“ They just keep making this their own moving target . ”
Another loophole was created for the sks semiautomatic carbine , developed in 1945 for use by the Soviet army until it was replaced by the more rugged AK - 47 .
The Bush administration reclassified the sks as a “ curio , ” adding it to the atf ‘s list of such weapons , most over 50 years old and considered collectors ’ items , that are automatically authorized for import .
However , the atf reported in 2002 that the sks was “ the rifle model most frequently encountered by law enforcement officers ” and noted that the guns “ are capable of penetrating the type of soft body armor typically worn by law enforcement officers . ”
Since being added to the atf ‘s curios list , the sks has become one of the cheapest assault rifles on the market — less expensive , at between $ 89 and $ 250 , than most handguns .
Yet even as foreign - made assault weapons are pouring in , information about their importation and use in crime is no longer accessible .
The atf maintains databases both of the firearms - import licenses it has granted and of the traces it has conducted on weapons recovered at crime scenes .
But in 2003 , at the urging of the National Rifle Association , Rep. Todd Tiahrt ( R - Kan . ) attached a last - minute amendment to a spending bill , prohibiting the agency from publishing import and trace data .
( “ I wanted to make sure I was fulfilling the needs of my friends who are firearms dealers , ” Tiahrt told the Washington Post . )
The nra ‘s motivation , says Dr. Garen Wintemute , an ER physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California - Davis , was to prevent atf data from being used against the gun industry in court .
“ Cities and advocacy organizations were bringing litigation against gun manufacturers for irresponsible marketing and also , in some cases , against individual retailers , ” he says .
“ Complete trace data would have helped them in doing that . ”
In March , however , the Associated Press managed to obtain atf trace data for 2007 , which showed a sharp increase in the number of trace requests for weapons , such as the AK - 47 and sks , that fire 7.62 - by - 39 - mm rounds — from just 1,140 traces in 1993 , the year before the assault - weapons ban was enacted , to 8,547 last year .
Already , since the ban ’s expiration in 2004 , the atf has documented an 11 percent rise in the number of traces run on AK - 47s and similar weapons — an increase that suggests more AKs are on the streets and are being used to commit crimes .
At the Fishersville gun show , crowd members seemed particularly drawn to the assault weapons on display — hefting them , staring down their barrels , sliding open their metal bolts with a satisfying action - movie click .
In addition to the AKs , dealers displayed dozens of AR - 15s , a semiautomatic variation of the US military ’s M - 16 , as well as a variety of World War II and Cold War -era surplus weapons .
At one table , a little boy admired a .50 - caliber sniper rifle , capable of downing a jumbo jet , while at another a man held a cheap Romanian AK knockoff to his shoulder .
His T - shirt read “ ‘ Freedom At Any Cost . ’— Randy Weaver , Ruby Ridge , Idaho . ”
The only thing that prevented me from becoming the proud owner of a mak - 90 was my Washington , DC , driver ’s license :
The district has the nation ’s strictest gun rules .
( At press time the law was under review by the Supreme Court . )
But if I really wanted the mak - 90 , one dealer pointed out , all I had to do was move to Virginia .
There is , of course , a wide variety of assault weapons on the market .
The expiration of the federal ban has essentially thrown the doors wide open — if the gun exists , you can buy it .
But it ’s the AKs that pose the greatest threat , primarily due to their affordability .
Police chiefs in cities across the country are involved in something of an arms race , says Scott Knight , chief of the Chaska , Minnesota , police department and chairman of the Firearms Committee at the International Association of Chiefs of Police .
“ When I started as a police officer , we had our sidearm , and we had a shotgun in the car .
Then we moved from the shotgun to a 9 mm carbine or rifle .
And actually , I ’m just moving from that 9 mm to an AR - 15 .
The reason is that the officer has been encountering a better - armed offender with alarming regularity … a better - armed , better - equipped , more - ready - to - shoot criminal than in the past . ”
Nowhere , perhaps , has this been more noticeable ( and quantifiable ) than in south Florida .
Speaking at the National Violent Crime Summit , a gathering of law enforcement executives held in suburban Chicago last September , Miami police chief John Timoney described how AK - 47s have become the weapon of choice among violent criminals in his city .
“ Two or three years ago , we had the lowest homicide rate since 1967 in Miami , ” he said .
“ Then the homicides skyrocketed with the availability of AK - 47s .
And it went from 3 percent of all homicides being committed with AKs , up to 9 percent two years ago , then 18 percent last year , and this year it is around 20 percent .
And it ’s going up …
We ’re being flooded with these AK - 47s . ” Garry McCarthy of the Newark , New Jersey , police department agreed .
“ We ’ve got a 30 percent reduction in shooting incidents this year , but only a 5 percent reduction in murder , ” he said .
“ So it is higher - caliber bullets .
I had n’t seen an AK - 47 in New York City going back 15 years …
In Newark , in our first six or eight months , we recovered about 15 of them .
[ We have had ] running gun battles through the streets . ”
And if law enforcement is noticing an uptick in AK - style rifles , it may soon confront a smaller , more easily concealable version : the AK pistol .
According to Dr. Wintemute , police recently recovered one in Newark .
“ You can hide such a thing easily in your pant leg , and you can put the magazine somewhere else , ” he says .
“ You can be walking around the street with , in essence , a concealable rifle with hundreds of rounds of ammunition , ready to rock . ”
Advertising its Romanian - manufactured AK handgun , Century International Arms Incorporated calls it “ a real conversation starter . ”
Correction appended : A print version of this story incorrectly stated that fully automatic weapons in existence can not be purchased or sold .
While these weapons can no longer be manufactured for civilian use under federal law , those registered before May 19 , 1986 , can still be obtained .

ANN ARBOR — A six - inch robotic spy plane modeled after a bat would gather data from sights , sounds and smells in urban combat zones and transmit information back to a soldier in real time .
That ’s the Army ’s concept , and it has awarded the University of Michigan College of Engineering a five - year , $ 10 - million grant to help make it happen .
The grant establishes the U - M Center for Objective Microelectronics and Biomimetic Advanced Technology , called COM - BAT for short .
The grant includes an option to renew for an additional five years and $ 12.5 million .
U -M researchers will focus on the microelectronics .
They will develop sensors , communication tools and batteries for this micro-aerial vehicle that ’s been dubbed “ the bat . ”
Engineers envision tiny cameras for stereo vision , an array of mini microphones that could home in on sounds from different directions , and small detectors for nuclear radiation and poisonous gases .
Low - power miniaturized radar and a very sensitive navigation system would help the bat find its way at night .
Energy scavenging from solar , wind , vibration and other sources would recharge the bat ’s lithium battery .
The aircraft would use radio to send signals back to troops .
“ These are all concepts , and many of them are the next generation of devices we have already developed .
We ’re trying to push the edge of our technologies to achieve functionality that was not possible before , ” said Kamal Sarabandi , the COM - BAT director and a professor in the U - M Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
COM -BAT also involves the University of California at Berkeley and the University of New Mexico .
It is one of four centers the Army launched as a collaborative effort among industry , academia and the Army Research Laboratory to work toward this vision of a small , robotic aircraft that could sense and communicate .
Each of the four centers is charged with developing a different subsystem of the bat , a self - directed sensor inspired by the real thing .
“ Bats have a highly - attuned echolocation sense providing high - resolution navigation and sensing ability even in the dark , just as our sensor must be able to do , ” Sarabandi said .
Echolocation allows real bats to navigate by emitting sounds and detecting the echoes .
The bat robot ’s body would be about six inches long .
It would weigh about a quarter of a pound and use about 1 W of power .
U -M researchers intend to improve on current technologies .
They ’ll work to develop quantum dot solar cells that double the efficiency of current cells .
They expect their autonomous navigation system , which would allow the robot to direct its own movements , to be 1,000 times smaller and more energy efficient than systems being used now .
They believe they can deliver a communication system that ’s 10 times smaller , lighter and more energy efficient than today ’s technologies .
The bat would be designed to perform short - term surveillance in support of advancing soldiers .
Or it could perch at a street corner or building for longer assignments and send back reports of activity as it takes place .
“ Throughout this research , we expect to make technological breakthroughs and have a much wider range of applications for other types of engineering problems , from medical to industrial , ” Sarabandi said .
COM -BAT will support 12 faculty members and 18 graduate students at U -M .

In Shindisi , the families gathered for a bus carrying sacks of rice and flour said they were too afraid to speak .
One old man had a badly beaten face .
When asked what had happened , another man answered in his place : “ Nothing happened to him . ”
About 90 percent of the town ’s residents had fled , a village elder said .
The fear was palpable in those who remained .
Many people trembled ; their bloodshot eyes looked as if they had been crying for days .
Out of earshot , a few men pulled a reporter aside .
“ They stole everything , ” one said , of the looters .
He placed the blame on Ossetian looters and not Russian Army soldiers .
During the day , three families said that the looters had appeared afraid of the Russian troops and had not often operated around them , although journalists in the past 10 days have seen looters intermingled at times with Russian units .
Almost all the people interviewed asked that their names be withheld , out of fear of reprisal while they lived in the lawless zone .
Three were so reflexively jumpy by the experiences of the past week that they dashed into the remains of a store at the sound of an approaching car .
The events the residents described underscored how hard it is to assess the scope and scale of the violence and crime , and eventually to assign precise blame .
There is no clear estimate yet either of the number of dead and injured or of the number of refugees .
Some Georgian residents said they had been robbed in repeated cycles of home invasion :
Three or four armed men would show up with a truck or car , rush through the house and cart off whatever they desired , and then go away .
Later , another car would arrive with a different gang .
This went on for days , and apparently was committed by a legion of criminals .
But assessing the origins of each individual offense was difficult .
Victims spoke of looters from Ossetia , Russia , and , in one case , Chechnya .
The technical issues first .
No chiaroscuro , but a pervasive , lumbering shroud of murk : action scenes seem to take place behind screen doors ; the camera is only inches away from the actors ’ faces .
Gotham , land of spires and leering gargoyles , is downgraded to glassy downtown Chicago , the Second City looking as poor in the half - light as if it were the Twenty - Seventh .
Heath Ledger is good , sure , perhaps the only actor taking any joy in the proceedings : but is he any better than Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow ?
He spends far too much time in the movie explaining himself and his cheerful anarchism , even though his point is that explanations are superfluous .
“ I do n’t have plans , ” he tells us , and neither do the filmmakers .
The logic of the action is a joke without a punch - line : cars , trucks , motorcycles slam together and hundreds of gas barrels explode , all inconsequentially : the body count is a staggering thirty - six , but had a pile more been thrown onto the fire , the effect would have felt equally numbing , like $ 185 million being thrown at your head .
Was the film edited ?
It ’s hard to tell .
The Scarecrow , villain of Batman Begins , appears early in the film to attempt a minor crime only to disappear in remainder , forgotten .
Gotham ’s mayor holds up a cigar cutter for an extended interview scene , but never cuts a cigar .
Few movies have been so adept at providing easy metaphors for their own incompetence .
But The Dark Knight , while doing this , eagerly does more : it presents itself as not just a comic book movie ( though it is decidedly that ) ; it is also an allegory , as thick as the Divine Comedy , for the present condition of America ’s debilitated relationship to the world .
The movie ’s “ deep structure ” is a way , then , of absolving its curious lack of levity and joy , the sort of quality that makes a comic book comic .
But The Dark Knight , as nearly every film critic in America seems to agree , is not a conventional genre film .
It desires the status of art .
And so , watching it , you ca n’t avoid noticing how it lays out its purpose in deadly earnest .
Its chaos is expensively calculated , and it is not at all benign .
To take it seriously is to come up against the sheer silliness of the conventions it has retained .
Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) , a billionaire who throws the most successful fundraisers in town , dates fantasy supermodel ballerinas with tremendous busts .
( This is not how ballerinas look in the real world . )
A languorous , overlong portion of the movie is devoted to Batman ’s attempt — in a move made familiar by every second installment of a superhero franchise — to discard his suit and return to everyday billionaire life , so that lawful Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) , a mob- busting DA like Rudy Giuliani , can run things .
But of course it turns out legal methods and due process are never enough to combat anarchic evil , and so Batman must return to fight , using criminal methods of his own .
Before this can happen , we must watch Batman get a new Bat - suit , which Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) has engineered to be lighter than his first suit , though it looks exactly the same on - screen .
To fight anarchy is to lose one ’s bearings , and to move one ’s own soul dangerously close to evil .
Ah , but such is the price of superhero - dom — or , as The Dark Knight would also like us to believe , the War on Terror .
The Joker is repeatedly referred to as a “ terrorist , ” and he is made to resemble the men and women the United States calls terrorists .
He captures police officers , tortures them , and then forces them to explain his own purpose on camera , much like the video of Daniel Pearl made by Khalid Sheikh Muhammed ( KSM ’s video , it should be said , was more professional ) .
The Joker ’s goal is to spread chaos amidst liberal civilization , to show the cultivated that their wealthy ideals can vanish when confronted by evil such as his .
And so the Joker , like other criminals in the film , is treated by Batman the way America treats terrorists : he is tortured .
Intellectuals who favor the use of torture in the United States often reduce the ethical question to a hypothetical “ ticking bomb ” scenario , in which a terrorist reveals he has a plot to blow up thousands of people in one hour , and the only way for officials to extract information from the lunatic in time is through ruthless physical violence .
“ Ethics 101 , ” Charles Krauthammer calls it .
“ Hang this miscreant by his thumbs .
It is a moral duty . ”
It does n’t matter that , in a real Ethics 101 class , one would learn that legal ethics is not reducible to a childish theoretical picture ; that there is not a shred of historical or present evidence on which to base such hypotheticals .
( There are bombs in the real world , but they never tick . )
Yet the real - world debate over torture is frequently reduced to this argument , because it has a terrifying simplicity to it .
As in the scenario itself , the argument does n’t even give you time to think : you are simply asked to decide , and your decision then becomes actual policy .
When it is presented in something like real time , as it is in The Dark Knight , it actually functions as “ Ethics 101 ” for the children who see the film .
This “ ticking bomb ” scenario occurs twice in the film .
In the first scenario , two lives are at stake — Harvey Dent ’s and his girlfriend ’s , Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) .
The Joker is beat up to get the information .
In the second , two boatloads of people are at stake , but the situation is marginally more complicated .
Reproducing a version of the “ prisoner ’s dilemma ” from game theory , the Joker has placed two explosives on two boats leaving the city .
One contains convicted criminals ; the other contains regular white - collar Gothamites .
Each boat can save itself if it chooses to destroy the other boat .
I trust I ’m not ruining anyone ’s future viewing if I point out that neither boat destroys the other , though members of each group are sorely tested .
In a manipulative move , the filmmakers have a large , scarred African - American prisoner stand up and angrily demand the detonator .
We are supposed to think , “ Oh , ah , this man is angry and black and wants nothing more than to kill whitey .
The other boat is doomed ! ”
But of course , our illiberal suspicions are baseless : he tosses the detonator out the window .
The effect is startling , but achieved vulgarly .
The means by which Batman finally finds the Joker ( who , of course , has his own detonator on the chance that his plan fails ) involve a massive surveillance system that he has set up in his cave , which tracks Gotham ’s citizens through their cell phones .
Morgan Freeman , frightened by the criminal potential of such an illegal machine , agrees to use this method only once , after which he insists on resigning .
Of course , this extreme method works .
Everything works .
In a digression , Batman is forced to travel to Hong Kong to capture a Chinese banker , who is helping to swell Bruce Wayne ’s trust fund by using the international mafia .
The Hong Kong excursion is leavened by beautiful shots of our superhero bat - gliding amidst skyscrapers , but the scene ’s essential point is that corrupt Chinese capitalism must be treated like terrorism — and so the banker is “ renditioned ” back to Gotham .
Again , it works .
The point , though , is not that you need to think about these things ; no teenager ( or film critic ) who views the film is likely to pick up on the allegory .
But they will surely get the message , as they get it from so many lesser attempts than Batman .
The ideological work is done by presenting these scenarios as mere games , such that they easily seem to repeat themselves in actual political life .
That they mirror so perfectly the Bush Administration ’s logic in justifying its wars and vast security apparatus would suggest that some apparatchik paid off the filmmakers to make the case again to the people .
But , of course , nobody paid anybody off .
The filmmakers , free citizens , stood up and produced the propaganda themselves , at their own cost , and for their own benefit .
The Dark Knight does not provoke profound debate about our methods and purposes .
It spectacularly affirms them .
“ We do n’t get the hero we need , ” Gary Oldman ’s Commissioner Gordon says , with Niebuhrian wistfulness , “ we get the hero we deserve . ”
Nor do we get the comic book movies we need .
But that is because we will never get them .
There is a sense that these films are harmless and merely to be indulged ; that we must love the forms that our film industry deems “ popular ” as much as we love our country .
This disgraceful logic is ensuring that such forms are becoming the only ones available .
Every summer brings comic book spectacles that attempt new heights in extravagance and waste .
Each time , the distinction between what might be authentically popular forms and those that win us over through sheer monetary bulk and grim “ seriousness ” is further mystified .
The great scandal is that a common delusion persists over the seriousness of films like The Dark Knight , which is usually invoked in the same breath that someone will say , defensively , “ Come on , it ’s only a comic book movie . ”
This paradox gets at the heart of what is wrong with The Dark Knight , and films like it .
Comic book films are not flexible adult forms , designed to provoke thought , but inflexible teenage forms , designed to elicit consent .
Their fundamental constants — the crushing loneliness of feeling outcast , the performative fakery of adult life ( cf. billionaire with busty ballerina ) — serve to buffer every conceit that this childishly self - regarding nation has about its mission in the world .
And if the superhero movies then insist on humility to accompany our international audacity , then so much the better .
Nothing smoothes the task of empire more than the feeling that you are doing it humbly .
History will record that , while a monumental catastrophe overtook the world financial markets and a new colonialism destroyed the lives of nations , the United States still found time and money to resolve in its films what it could not , for the life of it , perform in the world .

The society is to release its findings on Tuesday at a meeting of the International Primatological Society in Edinburgh .
Conservation society scientists said the continuing threat of Ebola precluded a change in the gorilla ’s status .
But the discovery was mainly stirring excitement .
“ This is the light of hope you look for , ” said Richard G. Ruggerio , a conservation biologist at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .
But he cautioned that the large gorilla populations in the two studied tracts , which cover 18,000 square miles , should not lead to complacency .
“ It ’s a different kind of alarm call , an opportunity that is increasingly rare on this planet  to do something before there ’s a crisis , ” he said .
A separate global update on primates is being issued Tuesday at the Edinburgh meeting , showing that  with a few exceptions  forest destruction and , increasingly , hunting for meat , pets and Chinese medicinal products are imperiling monkeys and other primates , from Congo Republic to Cambodia .
My recent comment piece explaining how Iran 's president was badly misquoted when he allegedly called for Israel to be " wiped off the map " has caused a welcome little storm .
The phrase has been seized on by western and Israeli hawks to re-double suspicions of the Iranian government 's intentions , so it is important to get the truth of what he really said .
I took my translation - " the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time " - from the indefatigable Professor Juan Cole 's website where it has been for several weeks .
But it seems to be mainly thanks to the Guardian giving it prominence that the New York Times , which was one of the first papers to misquote Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , came out on Sunday with a defensive piece attempting to justify its reporter 's original " wiped off the map " translation .
( By the way , for Farsi speakers the original version is available here . )
Joining the " off the map " crowd is David Aaronovitch , a columnist on the Times ( of London ) , who attacked my analysis yesterday .
I wo n't waste time on him since his knowledge of Farsi is as minimal as that of his Latin .
The poor man thinks the plural of casus belli is casi belli , unaware that casus is fourth declension with the plural casus ( long u ) .
The New York Times 's Ethan Bronner and Nazila Fathi , one of the paper 's Tehran staff , make a more serious case .
They consulted several sources in Tehran .
" Sohrab Mahdavi , one of Iran 's most prominent translators , and Siamak Namazi , managing director of a Tehran consulting firm , who is bilingual , both say ' wipe off ' or ' wipe away ' is more accurate than ' vanish ' because the Persian verb is active and transitive , " Bronner writes .
The New York Times goes on : " The second translation issue concerns the word ' map ' .
Khomeini's words were abstract : ' Sahneh roozgar . '
Sahneh means scene or stage , and roozgar means time .
The phrase was widely interpreted as ' map ' , and for years , no one objected .
In October , when Mr Ahmadinejad quoted Khomeini , he actually misquoted him , saying not ' Sahneh roozgar ' but ' Safheh roozgar ' , meaning pages of time or history .
No one noticed the change , and news agencies used the word ' map ' again . "
This , in my view , is the crucial point and I 'm glad the NYT accepts that the word " map " was not used by Ahmadinejad .
( By the way , the Wikipedia entry on the controversy gets the NYT wrong , claiming falsely that Ethan Bronner " concluded that Ahmadinejad had in fact said that Israel was to be wiped off the map " . )
If the Iranian president made a mistake and used " safheh " rather than " sahneh " , that is of little moment .
A native English speaker could equally confuse " stage of history " with " page of history " .
The significant issue is that both phrases refer to time rather than place .
As I wrote in my original post , the Iranian president was expressing a vague wish for the future .
He was not threatening an Iranian - initiated war to remove Israeli control over Jerusalem .
Two other well - established translation sources confirm that Ahmadinejad was referring to time , not place .
The version of the October 26 2005 speech put out by the Middle East Media Research Institute , based on the Farsi text released by the official Iranian Students News Agency , says : " This regime that is occupying Qods [ Jerusalem ] must be eliminated from the pages of history . "
( NB : not " wiped " .
I accept that " eliminated " is almost the same , indeed some might argue it is more sinister than " wiped " , though it is a bit more of a mouthful if you are trying to find four catchy and easily memorable words with which to incite anger against Iran . )
MEMRI ( its text of the speech is available here ) is headed by a former Isareli military intelligence officer and has sometimes been attacked for alleged distortion of Farsi and Arabic quotations for the benefit of Israeli foreign policy .
On this occasion they supported the doveish view of what Ahmadinejad said .
Finally we come to the BBC monitoring service which every day puts out hundreds of highly respected English translations of broadcasts from all round the globe to their subscribers - mainly governments , intelligence services , thinktanks and other specialists .
I approached them this week about the controversy and a spokesperson for the monitoring service 's marketing unit , who did not want his name used , told me their original version of the Ahmadinejad quote was " eliminated from the map of the world " .
As a result of my inquiry and the controversy generated , they had gone back to the native Farsi - speakers who had translated the speech from a voice recording made available by Iranian TV on October 29 2005 .
Here is what the spokesman told me about the " off the map " section : " The monitor has checked again .
It 's a difficult expression to translate .
They 're under time pressure to produce a translation quickly and they were searching for the right phrase .
With more time to reflect they would say the translation should be " eliminated from the page of history " .
Would the BBC put out a correction , given that the issue had become so controversial , I asked .
" It would be a long time after the original version " , came the reply .
I interpret that as " probably not " , but let 's see .
Finally , I approached Iradj Bagherzade , the Iranian - born founder and chairman of the renowned publishing house , IB Tauris .
He thought hard about the word " roozgar " .
" History " was not the right word , he said , but he could not decide between several better alternatives " this day and age " , " these times " , " our times " , " time " .
So there we have it .
Starting with Juan Cole , and going via the New York Times ' experts through MEMRI to the BBC 's monitors , the consensus is that Ahmadinejad did not talk about any maps .
He was , as I insisted in my original piece , offering a vague wish for the future .
A very last point .
The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah 's regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel .
As a schoolboy opponent of the Shah in the 1970's he surely did not favour Iran 's removal from the page of time .
He just wanted the Shah out .
The same with regard to Israel .
The Iranian president is undeniably an opponent of Zionism or , if you prefer the phrase , the Zionist regime .
But so are substantial numbers of Israeli citizens , Jews as well as Arabs .
The anti-Zionist and non-Zionist traditions in Israel are not insignificant .
So we should not demonise Ahmadinejad on those grounds alone .
Does this quibbling over phrases matter ?
Yes , of course .
Within days of the Ahmadinejad speech the then Israeli prime minister , Ariel Sharon , was calling for Iran to be expelled from the United Nations .
Other foreign leaders have quoted the map phrase .
The United States is piling pressure on its allies to be tough with Iran .
Let me give the last word to Juan Cole , with whom I began .
" I am entirely aware that Ahmadinejad is hostile to Israel .
The question is whether his intentions and capabilities would lead to a military attack , and whether therefore pre-emptive warfare is prescribed .
I am saying no , and the boring philology is part of the reason for the no . "
The Khronos Group has released a new mile stone version of the OpenGL API : version 3.0 , codename Long Peaks .
While this is really good news , Khronos is still unable to communicate with the community .
The Good : a new release
The Long Peaks release of OpenGL API was announced more than a year ago and was supposed to be released last fall .
However , despite the official announcement Khronos never made this release – and never published any note , hint or even unofficial statement .
Today , during the SIGGRAPH conference Khronos he published the new API version and made it available for download .
The new version is described as an evolutionary step which includes many new features while still supporting old hardware .
The new features include , among others :
Vertex Array Objects to encapsulate vertex array state for easier programming and increased throughput
non-blocking access to Vertex Buffer Objects with the ability to update and flush a sub-range for enhanced performance
full framebuffer object functionality including multi-sample buffers , blitting to and from framebuffer objects , rendering to one and two - channel data , and flexible mixing of buffer sizes and formats when rendering to a framebuffer object ;
32 - bit floating - point textures and render buffers for increased precision and dynamic range in visual and computational operations
transform feedback to capture geometry data after vertex transformations into a buffer object to drive additional compute and rendering passes
rendering and blending into sRGB framebuffers to enable faithful color reproduction for OpenGL applications without adjusting the monitor ’s gamma correction
Besides the OpenGL 3.0 release the press note also highlights that the OpenGL working group works now closely together with the OpenCL working group to make sure both fit together quite well .
OpenCL is a “ royalty - free standard focused on programming the emerging intersection of GPU and multi- core CPU compute ” , e.g. in the future OpenCL will be the language in question in case you want to make extensive calculations on your graphics card .
The Bad : the future
While all these news are pretty good news , there are indeed some shadows .
First of all the API itself is nice , but it will take some time until the graphic card developers will pick it up .
According to a Phoronix post Intel has n’t even started looking at OpenGL 3.0 .
Also , Nvidia and ATI / AMD extended the old OpenGL API in their implementations anyways to better support their modern hardware so many of the new features of the OpenGL API were already out in the wild quite some time .
Also , the question of when the free X drivers will support the new OpenGL depends on when Mesa 3D , the free OpenGL implementation , will support OpenGL 3.0 .
The Mesa project recently picked up quite some development speed , but before the last release it seemed to be almost dead .
Another , quite dark shadow is the Khronos group itself .
OpenGL 3.0 was necessary , but DirectX 11 is already in the pipe .
OpenGL must be comparable to it , and it does n’t look like that the 3.0 API matches that requirement .
However , the Khronos group obviously totally fails to manage a release : delaying a release is understandable , but not giving out * any * kind of information , not even a single piece of it , is not bad , that is horror .
In fact , all official channels ( newsletter , forum , etc. ) where dead for more than a year and gave everyone the feeling that the project itself is not alive anymore , that something bad has happened and the ship sunk before anyone could tell the users .
Such behavior leads to the loss of faith and trust by the developers and vendors – and an API without trust and faith is worthless .
So while Khronos invested work to bring out the next API they totally neglected the necessary work to keep in touch with their community ( hardware vendors , developers , projects , etc. ) .
How can you blame a vendor switching from OpenGL to for example DirectX when an API release was delayed for almost a year without any further notice ?
If Khronos handles the next release as they handled this one , OpenGL might already effectively be dead before the first beta version .
This Earth Day finds a large majority ( 83 % ) of the American public supporting stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment , and 69 % agreeing that “ we should put more emphasis on fuel conservation than on developing new oil supplies ; ” but when potential costs are mentioned , the number agreeing that “ people should be willing to pay higher prices in order to protect the environment ” declines to 60 % , down a bit since 2003 ( 65 % ) .
In general , however , the public ’s view of environmental issues has not changed drastically in recent years .
For instance , the percentage of Americans who believe that the nation needs stricter laws on the environment slipped from 90 % in 1992 to 82 % two years later , but since then has remained fairly stable .
In the 2007 survey , however , there has been a sharp increase in partisan differences over whether the nation needs stricter environmental laws .
Currently , 95 % of Democrats and 85 % of independents say that stricter environmental laws are needed , but just 65 % of Republicans agree .
The views of Democrats and independents have not changed significantly since the 2003 Values Survey , but fewer Republicans support tougher environmental laws and regulations than did so then ( 79 % vs. 65 % ) .
And the partisan divide on this issue , which was 17 points in the 2003 survey , has ballooned to 30 points .
In 1992 , the first time this question was asked , partisan differences were much narrower ( seven points ) .
There also are sizable differences within the Republican party over environmental values : Nearly eight - in - ten moderate and liberal Republicans ( 78 % ) agree that such laws are needed , but just 58 % of conservative Republicans agree .
Democrats are unified on the need for tougher environmental laws and regulations .

Barbara Ehrenreich has been called a Marxist just for writing that the US is not a classless society .
But criticism has never stopped her exposing social injustice before .
Emma Brockes talks to her about her new book , Barack Obama and the great wealth divide
Twenty years ago , Barbara Ehrenreich wrote an article for the New York Times in which she pointed out the growing inequality of American society and was promptly denounced , by a rival paper , as a Marxist .
" The Washington Times is an extreme - rightwing publication , " she says , so there was no surprise there .
But the paper 's reaction underlined a general principle : that while one can say " fairly wild " things about race and gender in the US , there persists a certain coyness about class .
" There 's this powerful myth that America does n't have classes ; that they 're an ancient English or European thing that we abolished .
And that if you 're not rich , it 's your own damn fault . "
Now 66 , Ehrenreich has devoted most of her career to disproving this maxim .
Her 2001 bestseller Nickel and Dimed was an account of the year she spent trying to eke out an existence on the minimum wage , which caused affluent readers everywhere to exclaim guiltily : " We had no idea ! "
She reported that companies cheat their staff of wages ( there are 70 lawsuits pending ) ; limit the number of toilet breaks staff take ; forbid them from talking to each other or using " profanity " on the premises , and that the cleaner you hired through a " reputable " firm is probably made to clean your house while sick or injured .
The book 's success owed much to the personal journey of Ehrenreich herself , who suggested the idea to her editor for a younger journalist to take on .
But she fitted the profile of the invisible worker - middle - aged , female and knackered .
Once in situ , she was bullied by various bosses and forced to retire each night to a motel because she could n't afford a flat .
Her latest book , which in the US is called This Land Is Their Land : Reports from a Divided Nation , is the animating force behind all this , a collection of columns that almost amounts to a manifesto .
The title comes from a Woody Guthrie song , which Ehrenreich can hardly bear to listen to these days .
She writes : " I flinch when I hear Woody Guthrie 's line , ' This land belongs to you and me ' .
Somehow , I do n't think it was meant to be sung by a chorus of hedge - fund operators . "
( The book 's UK publisher evidently did n't feel Guthrie 's song travelled well , and has opted for the title Going to Extremes instead . )
Ehrenreich 's skill , apart from the sheer quality of her writing , is to illustrate her opinions with wave after wave of examples , of unglamorous labour disputes and everyday injustices that do n't get much of a look - in elsewhere .
Through them she details how wealth in America has transferred from the bottom to the top , thanks to tax cuts for the rich and Bush 's reluctance to regulate the markets , and exposes the fallacy that " growth " as measured by GDP is , for the majority of Americans , synonymous with better living .
" It was just so fascinating to me , without being an economist , to see how in the past few years growth has become completely decoupled from wages or the real conditions of what we call working people , " she says .
" And the reason they were so decoupled is because of the huge inequality .
So you could have many [ economic ] indicators looking very sunny and good , but you 're talking about a population that is so divided there 's not an average there any more . "
A book about the joylessness of the American right must struggle to avoid matching it with a litany of dreary , rival orthodoxies .
But Ehrenreich has never been dour , nor for that matter predictable .
She lives in the historic town of Alexandria , just south of Washington DC , in a jolly chaos of papers and magazines .
On the mantelpiece is a card that reads , " I am not , therefore I buy " , but she is as suspicious of self - denial as she is of self - indulgence , both of which she sees as affectations .
In one unexpected column , Ehrenreich flies at Jane Brody , the health editor of the New York Times , who throughout the 90s championed with great influence the virtues of a low - fat , high - carb diet .
As well as questioning the health benefits of Brody 's principles , Ehrenreich calls them a way of enabling the well - off to feel virtuous merely by indulging their own narcissism .
" The low - fat diet has been the hair shirt under the fur coat - the daily deprivation that offsets the endless greed . "
The " tireless preaching " that bedevils modern life elicits a resounding screw - you from Ehrenreich .
Her latest bugbear is " positive thinking " , the underlying philosophy of much life coaching and motivational speaking , which she came across during the research for Bait and Switch , the follow - up to Nickel and Dimed .
In it , she spent a year trying to expose white - collar office life but was scuppered by not being able to get a job .
Instead Ehrenreich fell into the hands of the gannets who feed on the unemployed and sell them reassurances that getting a job is just a question of attitude .
This was illustrated by cheerful Kimberly , a " co-active coach " whom Ehrenreich employed and ended up wanting to kill .
As the economy recedes , you wonder if Kimberly and her ilk will disappear .
" I tend to think that the irrational , delusional approaches will persist , " she warns .
Ehrenreich is by training a scientist , with a degree in chemistry and a PhD in cell biology .
As a child she saw both sides of the economic divide .
Her father was a copper miner from Montana who got an education and eventually qualified as a metallurgist and made it on to the corporate ladder at Gillette .
" He was a very exceptional person , as he'd be the first to tell you .
But he never - nor did my mother - say about people who did n't do as well , ' Oh we did it , so they can do it . '
They recognised that theirs was an unusual trajectory . "
Did they identify as working - class ?
" No .
I think they would have said middle - class .
But I think my father always thought that he did n't fit in .
He was too rough - edged .
And he had a lot of contempt for , say , Ivy League types or MBA types . "
What she sees as the stigmatisation of the sick in the US is a reaction in part to a " strange little detail " of her childhood .
Her mother , who was politically more radical than her father and whom the young Ehrenreich would look at in alarm sometimes and wonder if she was a communist , had been brought up by her Christian Scientist grandparents .
" And in no other way was my mother continuing to be a Christian Scientist , except for one thing : health .
It was very bad to get sick .
I remember when I had trouble seeing the blackboard in about seventh grade , she said , " People in our family do n't wear glasses . "
Ehrenreich smiles ruefully .
Her son is a writer and her daughter a lawyer , ( Ehrenreich is divorced ; she moved to Alexandria to be near her two grandchildren ) and half of her family still lives on low wages ; her sister and her husband have just been forced to cancel their health insurance .
I wonder if she had ethical qualms about Nickel and Dimed ; is n't there something unsavoury about a comfortable journalist pretending to be poor and then being paid a lot of money to write about it ?
" Well you know , that never entered my mind . . . what began to bother me a little bit was that there was a deception involved ; that I had to tell people that I was working these jobs because I needed the money , which was n't true .
But I always tried at the end to tell people I had got to know what the truth was .
And then you can work off the guilt of any money by giving it away .
Easily fixed . "
Until the success of that book she had been freelance , and the security , she says , has been wonderful .
She has n't had a staff position since her first job working for the New York City government as a health planner , which she left after seven months when she decided that " the government was selling out to private interests " and went to work for a " radical collective " lobbying for better healthcare in the city .
" That 's where I started writing , because we had a newsletter and I loved to do investigative pieces . "
Nowadays , people write to Ehrenreich with their workplace horror stories .
The most shocking in the new book came from an ex-employee of one large retailer , who told Ehrenreich that in 2003 the company held him captive for six hours and interrogated him for giving a colleague a discount on a videogame , before getting him to write a false confession and firing him .
A former colleague alleged that such incidents were not unusual .
With Obama ascending there is hope of a sea change , although Ehrenreich remains characteristically cautious .
She sees him " tacking to the right " and was disheartened by his choice of economic adviser , Jason Furman , " who was to the far right of the Democratic party and made his reputation as a defender of Wal - Mart [ one of her principal targets in Nickel and Dimed ] .
And so in a way , I thought , OK , I 'm not going to pay [ Obama ] any attention for a while . "
I wonder if the huge success of Nickel and Dimed , and the tax bill that presumably came with it , has n't sent Ehrenreich skidding off a bit in that direction .
" Ha !
I have to watch that kind of stuff .
But no .
I always say , if I could pay more taxes and be in turn told for sure that there would be decent schools for my grandchildren , that there would be healthcare for them , that there would be social security , if there was something in return , other than wars , it would be a wonderful thing . "
She cackles .
" As it is , I just get angrier and angrier "

SNES Fighters That Define “ Terrible ”
Note from racketboy :
Our newest contributor , Ack , has been on a recent quest to track down a copy of every US - released fighting game on the Super Nintendo .
He ’s already shared his recommendations from the American library — now he ’s back with a vengeance to warn us of the onslaught of worse - than - mediocre games of the genre .
When someone says “ bad fighting game ” to you , what do you think of ?
If you ’re reasonably versed in the Super Nintendo , your thoughts may drift to Shaq Fu , C2 : Judgement Clay , or even the Primal Rage port that was , let ’s face it , atrocious .
But spend a little time with them , and you ’ll realize that these games are n’t the worst .
Sure , they have low sprite counts , horrid colors , terrible controls , pathetic single - player games , and gameplay that flows like an avalanche , but are these truly the worst ?
God no .
Oh God , no .
If talking about bad games makes you queasy , stop reading now .
If thinking about bad games makes you ill , turn back .
Because we ’re about to break ground in a Gaming No Man ’s Land .
And frankly , you do n’t want to touch these titles with a ten foot pole .
Ballz 3D : Fighting At Its Ballziest
So Virtua Fighter gets released , and suddenly somebody at PF Magic decides “ Hey ! A 3D fighting game .
That ’s awesome !
I sure wish we could make one of those . ”
And so they did .
Ballz 3D sticks the player in a flat , circular arena , complete with two levels of background .
The closer one contains a screen where mindless taunts are displayed about every time someone gets hit .
This also displays all information , such as match number , opponent name , and even home many opponents are left when you beat someone .
The farther background is about a screen ’s worth of picture , which simply repeats itself over and over .
All in all , bland and boring , just like the flat stage you ’re fighting on .
But I suppose the important question is how does it play ?
First , it is a two - button fighter .
It uses all six buttons on the SNES controller , but two are repeats of the attack buttons and two are used for jumping .
Never mind that jumping is usually pretty useless in 3D fighters , and this one is no exception .
As for the characters , they ’re all made up of balls .
It ’s an interesting idea , but they tend to lean more towards the crude side ( A farting monkey , anyone ? ) , or stereotypical ( Look , a strong guy , a clown , and random girl A ) .
Also , while they got the 3D bit down rather well for the time , distancing is almost impossible to tell .
You know if a move has connected if the other guy blinks white , but because everything spreads on a character when they attack , move , or do anything , I ca n’t tell where the hit box is .
It ’s also pretty easy to lose the other guy on the screen , so often times you can wander far enough away and have no idea where the fight is supposed to be .
Also , because of the 3D action , blocking is a bit weird to pull off , as are special moves .
Finally , the music is bizarre .
The track at the Title Screen is …well , let ’s just say I feel soiled after listening to it for a few minutes .
I finally believe it is possible for a game to have too much attitude .
Even with Nintendo censoring some of the language , I still feel insulted playing this title .
And dirty .
Very dirty .
Battle Blaze
So back before they were producing Guilty Gear , Sammy decided they would grace us with a fighting game featuring barbarians and knights and monsters for the Super Nintendo .
That got us Battle Blaze , a game where demons take over a fighting tournament to let their demon king free upon the earth .
The only problem with the demon king ’s plan was that one of the fighters managed to beat down the demon sent after him .
He does n’t get possessed , but dies in the process , and so his son must take up the sword and go beat down his father ’s possessed old friends .
This is where you come in .
There ’s only two game modes , The Hero and The Battle .
The Battle is your standard arcade , where you can select one of six characters to play against the CPU or a friend .
It has a nifty prep screen for the battle where a soldier lists your names and tells you the King decrees no cheating .
It ’s a nice touch .
Then there ’s The Hero , where the son must go around the map to fight the other champions and win the day .
It sounds cool , right ?
Unfortunately , it means little more than picking the order in which you fight your opponents .
Traversing the map equates to picking a location where certain characters will fight you .
And then there ’s the combat itself .
Battle Blaze takes a controller with six buttons and uses two of them .
And one of those buttons is for jumping .
That ’s right , it ’s a one button fighter .
To make matters worse , the jump button is also used in performing special moves , where it has to be held down to perform the move .
Now factor in the son as the worst character in the game , with little power , little range , and weak specials .
And then there ’s the enemies ’ ability to air block by attacking .
That ’s right , when the main character attacks in the air , he swings his sword .
A quick animation that ’s done in less than a second .
The CPU villains ’ animation does n’t end until they hit the ground , and the main character lacks the range to go through it to connect .
This is the rule of the game , not the exception .
Bottom line is this : I want to like Battle Blaze .
I really do .
It ’s got some good ideas , and while the stages are bland , I really like the sprites and the music .
But this is not a good fighting game by any stretch of the word .
Do n’t bother with it .
Pit-Fighter
I ’ll be honest .
I was n’t a fan of Pit - Fighter in the arcade , and I ’m not that into digitized sprites .
But the SNES port is nothing short of a mockery of the original game .
To fit Pit-Fighter on the cartridge , animations were dropped ( in some cases to single frames ) , stages were reduced to fewer then ten colors , characters were resized and redrawn so they look almost nothing like their arcade counterparts , the music was dropped , and the sound quality is garbled .
And to make up for it …nothing .
Not even an options menu .
If you want to see an example of a bad port , look to Primal Rage .
If you want something that could hardly be considered the original game , there ’s Pit-Fighter .
The title was literally stripped down to the bare bones , with even the final winning screen cut from the game .
Because of the dropping of frames and the lack of options , the closest thing a player can get to a difficulty setting is by picking different characters , with Ty the easiest ( a one - frame punch , just spam it to make it through the entire game ) , to Buzz being the equivalent of Hard Mode ( slowest character in the game ) .
Everything about this port is bad , from the pathetic lack of color to the random image of the boss showing up between every three or so rounds .
Half the time he says something , but the sound quality is so bad I ca n’t make it out .
The other half , he just kinda stares at me like an imbecile .
If you enjoyed Pit -Fighter for the arcade , do n’t bother with this .
In fact , no one should bother with this .
THQ took a game that was actually quite good looking for its time and gave us utter garbage .
Rise of the Robots
There was so much going for this game .
Originally for the PC , Rise of the Robots featured FMVs showing enemy intros and defeats even on the SNES , as well as an intro that shows the Cyborg entering the city .
Graphically it looked amazing for its time , from the menu design with the Cyborg sitting at a console , pressing buttons for certain objects , to some pretty entertaining character design .
Pieces would go flying off whenever a hit connects to bounce on the ground , and there are even reflections of the characters on some of the stage floors !
And with a soundtrack featuring Brian May , formerly of Queen , it had to be good , right ?
Well , no , actually .
For starters , while May was doing his best with the soundtrack , and actually composed a full album , his record studio continually requested delays , forcing Mirage to do all their own music .
Second , while the graphics are good , stage design was actually a bit bland , and characters had few animations .
All six buttons on the controller were used , but only for four different attacks , a system of weak and strong punches and kicks that share similar frames of animation .
They look so similar , it ’s actually difficult to tell the two apart .
Factor in single - button special moves , and you have a recipe for disaster .
And then there was the horrid multiplayer , where one character was forced to play the main character , and the other got to be their choice of enemy robot .
None of the robots were rebalanced , either , so certain characters were vastly overpowered .
In the end , it may look good , but it is not a quality title by a long shot .
Game journalist Stuart Campbell even went so far as to write an angry letter to Mirage and Time Warner about it .
Do yourself a favor and avoid it .
Street Combat
Ever wonder what would happen if you took a Ranma ½ game in Japan , edited all the sprites to make Ranma into some guy with a mullet , and did away with the story entirely ?
Why , you ’d have Street Combat !
The game has little in the way of options beyond 2 - player and Vs. CPU , only 8 ( technically 7 ) characters , and no plot .
Make it through Vs. CPU mode , and a random man gives Steven ( the player ) a trophy and tells him he ’s a fine young man .
Never mind that if I walked around beating the snot out of random individuals , no one would call me that .
But back to the game …
So Steven has to fight a bunch of random individuals who make corny taunts and are all redrawn Ranma sprites .
To make matters worse , not only does this game commit the mortal sin of 2D fighters by having a jump button , it also uses the L and R buttons for blocking .
That ’s right , no pressing away from your opponent on the D - pad .
This game goes above and beyond with unintuitive design .
It ’s really a 3 - button fighter , with one for punch , kick , and special , which makes Steven create some magical circle .
Do n’t ask , it ’s never explained .
As for design , the game is very bright and colorful , almost nauseatingly so .
The music is pretty bland , with the IREM publisher screen potentially having the best music in the game .
In multiplayer , there are two Steven ’s available , one in the weird blue armor , and one in what I can only image are “ street clothes , ” as well as all the other characters .
In Vs. CPU mode , the player is forced to play as Steven , though at the Versus screen they can change costumes using the D-pad .
For the record , the game was actually created by NCS / Masaya , known for their wonderful child - friendly series Cho Aniki .
If you do n’t know what that is , do n’t look it up .
Ultraman : Towards the Future
Hey , Ultraman !
This has got to be good , right ?
Wrong !
ScrewAttack once claimed this was the worst fighting game ever made , and after spending a few minutes with it , it ’s hard not to agree .
The player controls Ultraman as he faces off against ten of his monstrous enemies .
All six buttons on the controller are used , with B and A serving as punch and kick , respectively , X serving as jump , Y as special attack , and L and R to cycle through different special attacks .
Special moves , like somersaults , flip kicks , and other abilities , can be performed by pressing different directional buttons and attack buttons at the same time .
Sounds like a nice system , right ?
Unfortunately , in all this Ultraman mayhem , Bandai forgot a block button .
There is an Ultraman Shield , but no way to block your average attack .
Also , do n’t bother crouching , as there are no crouching attacks .
And the majority of the time the enemy is backing away from you , so you ’re constantly on the move anyway .
Why is the enemy moving away ?
Two reasons : first , enemies regenerate health .
Ultraman does n’t .
Whoever thought that was a good idea is an idiot .
Then there ’s the second reason .
To kill an enemy , Ultraman not only has to beat them down to no health , he then has to hit them with a special attack , called Plasma Bolt .
It would n’t be so bad , except you have to charge up your special attacks , and it takes a good thirty seconds to charge a plasma bolt .
Miss , and you have to recharge the full attack again .
Now factor in any other special attack , or that shield I mentioned before , draining power , and it takes even longer .
Meanwhile the enemy is regaining health , so even if you do get charged , they have to be beaten back down .
Throw in a three minute time limit , and this is a recipe for disaster .
Now factor in everything not in the game : specifically alternate game modes , and animations .
That ’s right , all that exists in Ultraman is the single player game , and there is little in the way of animation for most of the enemies .
That monster just turned around in two frames .
Apparently that was some kind of attack .
It opened its mouth .
Apparently that was another attack .
Outside of their projectiles ( which they abuse constantly ) , there is no way to tell if something is fighting back or not .
And there ’s no way to change difficulty settings , so after a while , an enemy will inevitably knock the crap out of you .
You only get two credits to play through the game , too , and while you may gain extra credits for earning 50000 points , that ’s at least a good three or four battles in even when playing well .
I suppose I ca n’t be too harsh .
Ultraman is ok about a few things .
It ’s stage design is pretty cool , often with smashed buildings in the back and foreground .
Unfortunately this does hamper the player ’s site , and said stages just wrap around .
There is no corner to knock the enemy into so they can just keep running and regenerating .
The game ’s also nice about dying .
Get killed and when you come back , the monster will be close to where you left it in terms of health .
Of course you still have to recharge your Plasma Bolt , so it ’s not that much of a boon .
And then there ’s the the intro to each fight .
Honestly , that ’s the best part , watching a bunch of explosions and then Ultraman shows up , just in time for an extreme closeup .
No matter how angry I was with this title , I ’d break out into laughter every time I saw it .
It ’s actually a pretty good stress reliever , there to keep me from screaming in rage about the rest of this horrible game .
Out of all of the fighters , these are the bottom of the barrel .
Sure , Shaq
Fu might have had poor framerates and clunky controls , but these titles prove that it ’s actually rather mediocre … just on the low end of mediocre .
Then again , playing these titles makes just about any game look good .

The Low End of Mediocre
( CNN ) --
A severed human foot was found washed up on an island on the western coast of Canada this week , the fifth detached foot found in the area in the past 11 months , according to local police and media reports .
A left foot washed up on Westham Island , which is south of Vancouver , British Columbia .
The foot was found Monday on the shore of Westham Island south of Vancouver , according to Constable Sharlene Brooks of the Delta Police Department in British Columbia .
The severed left foot , which was in a shoe , was taken to a coroner for DNA tests , she added .
The foot was one of five found in area recently , she said .
" Our first step is to establish identity , " Brooks said .
" It is a little mysterious , but we do n't know if it is linked to others . "
According to the Vancouver Sun newspaper , the other four feet found in the area since August were right feet .
See where the feet are turning up »
The gruesome discoveries have garnered a lot of attention , Brooks said .
But it may be some time before police determine why so many severed feet have been found .
" We suffer from the CSI effect -- people think this can happen very quickly , " she said .
" It could take weeks or months .
And even if we get a DNA sample , we need a sample to match it with . "
The mystery has caused a stir and given birth to many rumors , locals say .
One newspaper has began investigating a rash of young men who have gone missing in the area .
Some have wondered if the feet could belong to a group of men who were in a plane that recently crashed in the waterway where the feet were found .
" But there has also been rumors about gangs and stuff , " said Diane Selkirk , a freelance writer who lives near where one of the feet was found .
" At first , the talk about it was really humorous .
But as more feet turned up , the talk became sinister , " she said .
" These are pristine islands , not the place where you would expect to find a bunch of severed feet . "

Are Ubuntu Users Getting the Best of Both Worlds ?

For a community distribution , Ubuntu sure knows how to preen itself to look good for the business world .
Canonical has n't exactly kept its plans to get on IT managers ' radar a secret , but the number of enterprise - ready applications for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS that are slowly becoming available in the Ubuntu Partner repository is getting hard to ignore .
Lots of familiar projects are partnering with Canonical to give presentations this week at LinuxWorld Expo .
Zmanda is talking about open source backup for Ubuntu , LikeWise Software is offering tips on cost - effective ways to achieve secure integration of Ubuntu and MS Active Directory , and Zimbra is exploring next generation messaging on Ubuntu .
See the common denominator there ?
It 's Ubuntu , the same linux distribution my next - door neighbor -- who is not a small business owner -- uses .
As Sam Dean noted Alfresco , the popular open source content management system ( CMS ) , announced today it will offer Alfresco Labs 3 pre-packaged within Ubuntu .
It 's available for download via the distro's Package Manager .
In a prepared statement from Alfresco Software , Martin Musierowicz , VP Alliances , says the move is motivated by Ubuntu 's continued growth and " the backing of a professional organization such as Canonical . "
In similar news , IBM 's Lotus Symphony suite of word processing , spreadsheet , and database apps is now available through the Ubuntu Add / Remove Software tool .
Though many businesses choose OpenOffice.org as an alternative to Microsoft Office , Canonical 's ISV manager , Malcolm Yates , says , " with IBM ’s extra developments , they are positioning Symphony towards the existing Lotus user base who are looking for a low cost alternative to the incessant upgrade cycle . "
Lotus Notes is expected to be available through the repository soon .
While the inclusion of enterprise - level apps in what many consider a community distribution is interesting news by itself , the bigger picture is far more fascinating .
While companies like Red Hat and Novell are dividing labor and creating separate distros that cater to two markets -- personal and business -- Canonical is pooling all its talent into strengthening a single offering .
Through its Ubuntu Partner program , Canonical is helping shepherd some very useful projects into the hands of users who might not otherwise think ( or want ) to experiment with them .
After all , it 's easy to play with the Zimbra desktop -- and dump it if you do n't like it -- when it's only a few clicks away and you know it wo n't be necessary to shoehorn it onto your flavor of Linux .
I can't help but wonder what other open source enterprise projects are languishing in relative obscurity because they do n't have a community distro to link up with .
Sure , companies like Novell and Red Hat routinely make enterprise - level apps available for the commercial versions of their product , but would some of those projects be just as attractive to community users ?
On the one hand , I understand the drive to create a distro " for the people , by the people . "
A community - driven project created by its users is likely to be of more value to in the long - run to its actual users .
Hobbyists wo n't have the time or inclination to wrestle an enterprise - level CMS into a distro they plan to use on their home computer .
On the other hand , if the vendor is willing to do most of the heavy lifting involved in making sure the product will work with a given distro , partner repositories like Ubuntu 's seem like good sense .
Of course , this does n't even begin to address the question of whether the development of a Linux distribution is better served by a single , driven focus like Canonical 's Ubuntu team .
Or is a division of labor , like the development teams at openSUSE and Fedora , more beneficial in the long run ?
That 's another topic altogether .
What do you think ?
Would you like to see more partner repositories for other distributions ?

Making Sense of Problems at Fannie and Freddie
An examination of how Fannie Mae works , the current problems and some proposed actions .
Dr Adrian Bowyer , a senior lecturer in engineering in the Faculty of Engineering & Design at the University of Bath , has created RepRap , an open source prototype machine that has succeeded in making a duplicate of itself - by printing its own parts and building a clone .
RepRap is short for replicating rapid - prototyper .
RepRap employs a technique called ‘ additive fabrication ’ .
The machine works a bit like a printer , but rather than squirting ink onto paper , it puts down thin layers of molten plastic which solidify .
These layers are built up to make useful three - dimensional ( 3D ) objects .
RepRap has , so far , been capable of making every day plastic goods such as door handles , sandals and coat hooks .
Now , the machine has also succeeded in copying all its own 3D - printed parts .
These parts have been printed and assembled by RepRap team member Vik Olliver in Auckland , New Zealand , into a new RepRap machine that can replicate the same set of parts for yet another RepRap machine and so on ad infinitum .
While 3D printers have been available commercially for about 25 years , RepRap is the first that can essentially print itself .
The machine will be exhibited publicly at the Cheltenham Science Festival ( 4 - 8 June 2008 ) .
Dr Bowyer said : “ These days , most people in the developed world run a professional - quality print works , photographic lab and CD - pressing plant in their own house , all courtesy of their home PC .
Why should n't they also run their own desktop factory capable of making many of the things they presently buy in shops , too ?
“ The possibilities are endless .
Now , people can make exactly what they want .
If the design of an existing object does not quite suit their needs , they can easily redesign it on their PC and print that out , instead of making do with a mass - produced second - best design from the shops .
They can also print out extra RepRap printers to give to their friends .
Then those friends can make what they want too . ”
Recently , Chris DiBona , Open Source Programs Manage at Google Inc , encouraged people to : " Think of RepRap as a China on your desktop . "
Sir James Dyson , Chief Executive of the Dyson Group , said : “ RepRap is a different , revolutionary way of approaching invention .
It could allow people to change the ergonomics of a design to their own specific needs . ”
Dr Bowyer hopes people will come to the Cheltenham Science Festival and see both the ' parent ' and the ' child ' RepRap machines in action for the first time together .
Adrian Bowyer ( left ) and Vik Olliver ( right ) with a parent RepRap machine , made on a conventional rapid prototyper , and the first complete working child RepRap machine , made by the RepRap on the left .
The child machine made its first successful grandchild part at 14:00 hours UTC on 29 May 2008 at Bath University in the UK , a few minutes after it was assembled .
" RepRap is the most enjoyable research project I 've ever run , " he said .
" And without the many talented and selfless volunteers the RepRap project has all round the world , it would have never succeeded so quickly . "
Complete plans for the prototype RepRap 3D printer and detailed tutorials to aid motivated amateurs ( and professionals ) in assembling one are available to everyone free at the RepRap website ( details below ) .
The materials , plus the minority of parts that the machine cannot print , cost about £ 300 .
All those non-printed parts can be bought at hardware shops or from online stores .
Adrian and several of the other Reprap team members will be available to answer questions and exhibit the parent and child Darwin printers in operation at the Cheltenham Science Festival on 4 – 8 June 2008 .
Editor ’s note : this piece has been contributed by guest blogger Kevin Hughes .
Kevin was generous enough to share his own experience with installing a solar hot water system on his home .
Thank you , Kevin !
I live in Los Angeles and I prefer the ugly one !
Please do n’t get me wrong , my wife is very beautiful , but when it comes to solar power , I prefer the ugly one .
Let me explain , for the past few years there has been huge interest in Solar Electricity ( photovoltaic ’s , PV , or solar panels ) , there are lots of incentives at both a state and federal level , there are often photo opportunities for politicians , gazing towards the future over a vast array or solar panels .
But there are problems with this vision : solar electricity is expensive to purchase and install ; it has a long pay back period ; it converts sunlight to usable energy fairly inefficiently , and because of that , you need quite a lot of roof space or land to put up enough panels to power your home .
The ugly one that I prefer is solar thermal , specifically solar hot water , a much older technology .
It is also much cheaper to install , much more efficient , and has a much faster pay back .
It can even be a do - it - yourself project if you are reasonably handy .
As for the payback , that ’s easy : you do n’t have to pay for 70 - 100 % of your hot water heating costs , and with a clever tweak , you can save 10 - 15,000 gallons of water annually , and reduce your water and electricity costs .
Let ’s start with a few details , then I will tell you how I added solar hot water ( SHW ) with a twist , to my house .
I live in Los Angeles on a hillside in the Santa Monica Mountains , about 2 miles inland from the beaches in Malibu .
We heat water with propane which comes from a storage tank filled every month or so by a delivery truck , and until recently we used about 30 % of our total home energy to heat water .
We are an ordinary family , with 2 kids at home , and have the usual uses for hot water , washing clothes , running the dishwasher , bathing and so on .
My wife and I have become more eco-conscious over the past few years , and have taken some steps to being green .
For instance we have switched all of our light bulbs to compact fluorescent bulbs ( CFL’s ) , and we ’re using tote ’s rather than plastic or paper shopping bags .
So I was looking for a project that would make a real difference , and would give me something to keep me busy for a while .
We could afford to invest maybe $ 2-3,000 , preferably spread over a few months .
I had known about solar hot water from our travels in Greece , where pretty much every house has it installed .
I got hold of a book , and spent some time reading up on Solar Water Heating by Bob Ramlow and Benjamin Nusz .
The concept seemed pretty simple , and could be added to our existing hot water set - up , effectively using the sun to pre-heat water before it went into the propane hot water tank .
I used Microsoft Excel to draw up some plans , and a system schematic ( see image below ) , and marched off to the local permit office .
Here is a schematic of the eventual system , which has evolved a bit from my first permit office visit .
Largely as a result of their help , and the help of a yahoo group called Solar Heat , the design evolved into something that works .
There are actually only 6 new components , plus pipe work , ( which seemed daunting at first , but with patience and practice , was actually pretty simple ) .
The main components were : ( 1 ) Solar Collector , ( 2 ) small Solar Panel to power the ( 3 ) Pump , a ( 4 ) Solar Storage Tank , a ( 5 ) Tempering Valve , and finally the twist , the ( 6 ) Hot Water Recirculation box .
Starting from the top , the solar collector is a 10 ft by 4ft by 4in panel , ( a Sunearth EP - 40 from Solartrope ) with a copper plate to absorb solar energy , and pipes inside to transfer the heat into the water .
It weighs about 150 lbs , so the permit office was concerned about the strength of the roof being able to hold the weight .
They wanted a structural engineer to assess the strength of the roof , but someone on the Yahoo group suggested that if it was safe , I should just take a picture of me on the roof .
I weigh ( lots ) more than 150 lbs so it would prove the roof was strong enough , and took a picture of a 400 lb stress test , which the permit office accepted .
Next ( 2 ) is the small Solar Panel which supplies the 12 volt , 10 watts needed to operate the circulation pump .
I bought this on e-bay for about $ 80 .
While seeming really simple , this is in fact a pretty sophisticated control system .
The pump only runs when there is enough solar energy to allow the panel to create electricity , and if there is enough sun to do that , there is enough sun to heat the water .
Also it is the true eco-option because you do n’t even have to plug the pump in to an electric power source .
The pump ( 3 ) is very small , but quite expensive .
What you are paying for is for it to last 20 - 25 years and operate reliably for the whole of that time .
Again , some web research produced the option of an El Sid pump , which I got from Solar Developments .
The pump is really quiet , and the only way to tell that it is on is that the LEDs in the cover light up .
The Solar Storage Tank ( 4 ) is a completely standard electric hot water tank , except that it is not plugged in .
I chose a Whirlpool Energy Star 50 gallon tank which I got from Lowes .
The key is to get a tank with as much insulation around it as possible , efficiency is measured by Energy Factor ( EF ) , and this is a good choice with an EF of 0.95 ( out of 1.0 ) and 3 inches of insulation .
This high EF will keep the water heated during the day and hot throughout the night .
We now have the basic components of the Solar Hot Water system that is capable of heating water to over 140 degrees .
The system can also store the water until it is needed , water pressure will move that water into the propane water storage tank ( which of course wo n’t light because the thermostat tells it that the water is already hot enough ) .
There is a small problem though : water this hot represents a bit of danger .
If we allow it to go through to the faucets it can burn or scold , so we need to control the heat on its way out of the propane tank .
Yes that ’s right , our solar hot water system can make water that is too hot for use so we have to cool it down a bit !
To do that we added a Tempering Valve ( 5 ) to the outlet pipe , this mixes cold water in with the hot until it is at the temperature you set .
In our house that is 125 degrees , because my wife likes really hot baths , but would normally be 110 to 120 degrees .
That is the system in full , except for the twist , which I will talk about now .
Have you noticed that when you turn the hot faucet on in a hotel it gives you hot water straight away , and compare that with your house where you might have to wait 2 minutes and gallons of water before the hot water “ comes through ” , well the hotels have what is called a Hot Water Recirculation system ( 6 ) , and when applied to a house it can save 10 - 15,000 gallons of water a year , which otherwise just runs out of the faucet while you are waiting for the hot water .
What this system does is measure the temperature in the hot pipe and when it gets cooled , it pushes that water into the cold pipe and draws more hot water from the tank .
When you are paying for the water to be heated this can be expensive , but when water heating is free ( or solar ) then it costs nothing and saves lots of water .
There is one other energy efficient factor to this system , when the dishwasher is switched on , without re-circulation , cool water from the hot pipes is drawn into the dishwasher , and then re-heated to wash the pots and pans , so incredibly , you just paid for that water to be heated twice !
With recirculation , hot water is pulled from the hot pipe into the dishwasher , where it does not have to be re-heated , and it can get used straight away .
Re-circulators vary in price , with the expensive ones having better control systems and timers , I picked a RedyTemp system which seems great , but is at the top end of the cost range .
That ’s it really .
The system took about 3 months from initial drawings to a working system , using weekends and the odd hour here and there , if you want a professional to install a system it can be done in just a few days .
I still have all of the receipts but have not added them up yet , I think they will add up to about $ 3,000 , and I get a federal tax break for 30 % of that , a professional installation would probably have cost me $ 6-8,000 including all of the parts .
There were times when I got things wrong and had to undo and redo them again .
The scariest moments were drilling holes in the roof for the pipes to go through , but as long as I followed the old adage “ measure 20 times , cut once ” it would work out .
I have added 3 temperature gauges to the system since it was initially finished to measure the temperature being generated by the solar panel , the temperature being transferred to the Propane water tank , and finally the temperature being delivered to the house .
The hottest water to date is 180 degrees from the panel , the outside temperature was over 100 degrees that day , and the system seems to be saving about $ 80 - 100 per month so our payback should only take 3 - 4 years .
In case you ’re not as handy as Kevin , you can find a solar installer near you here .

Click here for Gallup 's special roundup of July 's important election polls .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update on registered voters ' presidential preferences shows Barack Obama with a modest four percentage point advantage over John McCain , 47 % to 43 % .
Voter preferences fluctuated in the time immediately after Obama 's much publicized overseas trip .
First , Obama 's lead stretched to nine points near the conclusion of the trip , only to disappear when McCain moved into a precise tie with Obama near the end of last week .
Now , the race seems to have reverted to where it has been for most of the summer , with Obama holding a narrow advantage .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
If indeed the race has settled back to " the norm " for the time being , it could represent the calm before the storm .
With vice presidential running mate announcements and the party conventions forthcoming in the next several weeks , enough voter preferences could be changed by these events to cause renewed movement in the overall numbers .

John McCain and the adjective “ maverick ” were once seemingly inseparable , and his quixotic attempt in 2000 to win the Republican presidential nomination helped weld that link .
But now that the Arizona senator is about to become his party ’s nominee , he finds himself in an uncomfortable spot : having to defend his reputation as a political independent .
McCain ’s campaign unveiled an ad last week that calls him “ the original maverick , ” and he has retooled his stump speech to remind independent voters disenchanted with Republicans that he defied his party on campaign finance reform , tobacco regulation and the early Iraq strategy .
Democrats , sensing a weakness , have started to chant that this year ’s John McCain is not the voluble insurgent who terrorized his party ’s establishment eight years ago .

In Elkhart , Ind. , last week , McCain ’s Democratic opponent hit this theme hard .
“ The price he paid for his party ’s nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position , ” Barack Obama told voters at a town hall meeting .
“ And now he embraces the failed Bush policies over the last eight years -- politics that helped break Washington in the first place .
And that does n’t exactly meet my definition of a maverick . ”
This debate over McCain ’s maverick - ness reflects a new challenge in his second bid for the presidency : the dilution of the McCain brand .
To win the GOP primary this year , McCain embraced party dogma in ways big and small , from switching his opposition to President Bush ’s tax cuts , which he had criticized as skewed to the rich , to making amends with religious leaders he once denounced as “ agents of intolerance . ”
The campaign has also undercut McCain ’s image as a straight - talker by dramatically limiting the national media ’s access to the candidate , who once charmed reporters and voters alike with his easy , free - wheeling , common - man conversational style on his campaign bus .
And McCain , this time around , faces an opponent who can make a case that , as a 47 - year - old black man and first - term senator , he is more of a political outsider with a fresh new voice than the 71 - year - old veteran of a quarter - century in Congress .

McCain campaign officials said the increased focus on their candidate ’s maverick credentials was long planned .
“ It was always going to have to be a part of our campaign for the general election , ” top advisor Charles Black said .
But Black acknowledged that the campaign thought it was also important to directly rebut Obama ’s central line of attack -- that McCain represents a third Bush term .
“ Sure he ’s been in Washington 26 years , but he ’s always been a reformer , always worked across party lines , sacrificed his own political interests to do so , ” Black said .
“ So we were always going to have to tell that narrative , because some people know it , but not everybody . ”
McCain staffers bristle at Democratic contentions that their candidate is no longer a maverick , pointing to his belief that global warming is caused by pollution and his willingness to criticize Republicans for pork - barrel spending .

Analysts say many voters will probably continue to see McCain as a political contrarian .
“ He can point to areas where he broke with the Bush administration , where he broke with his own party , ” said Charles H. Franklin , a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin .
“ That part of the maverick image probably is n’t going away . ”
The new emphasis on that image , Franklin said , is to counter possible blow back from the scathing ads the Arizona Republican has launched against Obama .
The ads have alarmed some supporters who fear McCain could jeopardize his reputation by appearing to take the political low road .
Last week , McCain ’s camp released an ad that contends “ we ’re worse off than we were four years ago . ”
The spot calls him “ the original maverick , ” and says he has a record of taking on corruption “ in both parties . ”
He followed up Thursday with a Web ad made up of clips of prominent Democrats praising him for forging his own path in Washington .
Democrats immediately shot back .

“ The John McCain of 2000 would n’t even consider voting for the John McCain of 2008 , ” Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean , one of the Democrats whose praise of McCain was excerpted in the video , said in a statement .
“ John McCain has changed :
He ’s taken the low road , leveling false , negative and misleading attacks against Barack Obama . ”
In 2000 , few questioned McCain ’s maverick credentials .
He had stirred anger among conservatives by pushing a ban on the unlimited contributions to the parties that were used to finance campaigns .
He locked horns with the tobacco lobby in 1998 when he sponsored an anti-smoking bill that would have raised cigarette taxes and was ultimately derailed by Republicans .
He had long rankled colleagues with his campaign against earmarked projects , farm subsidies and pork - barrel spending .
And he famously called televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell “ agents of intolerance . ”
His iconoclastic path continued into the early Bush years .
He opposed the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 .
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs , he pursued lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates , who were accused of bilking tribes of millions of dollars -- a move that embarrassed some GOP lawmakers who had dealings with Abramoff .
He also angered conservatives by working with Democrats in 2005 to stave off a Senate rule change favored by GOP leaders that would have eased the path of the administration ’s conservative judicial nominees .
Advertisement
But McCain ’s positioning for the 2008 race undercut that firebrand image .
He now supports making the Bush tax cuts permanent .
He has vowed to appoint conservative judges .
And he gave the commencement speech at Falwell ’s college , Liberty University .
“ I do not believe in holding grudges in life or in politics , ” McCain said at the time .
“ Around 2005 or so , he realized he was running for president and he made a calculated decision . . . he was going to do whatever was necessary to win this office , ” said Matt Welch , editor in chief of Reason magazine , whose book “ McCain ” is subtitled “ The Myth of a Maverick . ”
Nonetheless , analysts say McCain still fits into a venerable tradition of legislators who tend to back their political party but will go against it on key issues .
“ A maverick does n’t mean you ’re always against your party , ” said Julian Zelizer , a history professor at Princeton University .
Zelizer pointed to the lingering distrust of McCain within the GOP .
“ So many Republicans just hate him because he does n’t play ball , ” he said .
“ That ’s the definition of what a maverick is . ”
Advertisement
Those resentments have created a delicate balancing act .
McCain cannot denigrate Bush and GOP orthodoxy to the point that he alienates already - unenthused Republican voters .
But he also must convince independents and conservative Democrats disillusioned by Bush ’s presidency that his outsider credentials are genuine .
“ He needs to basically keep those two groups , who fundamentally hate each other ’s guts on every issue , behind him , ” Welch said .

Times staff writer Peter Nicholas contributed to this report .
Americans have traditionally been optimists , and still probably think that if we could only make the right choices , the next President  working together with the next Congress  could clean up the mess Bush - Cheney and The Best Congress Money Can Buy have made , thereby making it safe to go abroad once again carrying an American passport .
Perhaps you ’re wondering , now , how we ever got into this mess ?
Well , scroll back in time to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 .
Hallelujah !
Dancing in the streets !
Peace in Our Time !
The prospect of Armageddon in central Europe was no more !
Hence , both the Soviet Union and the United States began to withdraw from service the tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that had been specifically developed and deployed to fight that final battle .
Later that year , with the Soviet Union itself on the verge of economic collapse , Russian officials came to " lobby " our Congress .
They told Senator Sam Nunn that they wanted to dismantle the tens of thousands of Soviet nukes excess to Russian needs , recover the fissile material ( essentially pure U - 235 uranium and Pu-239 plutonium ) from those dismantled nukes , and then store it until they could eventually dispose of it as reactor fuel .
The problem was , the Russians did n’t have the money to do all of that .
Would Congress help ?
Rarely has Congress responded so quickly to any request .
The Nunn - Lugar Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act was attached to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty Implementation Act of 1991 , which just happened to be pending before the Senate .
Nunn - Lugar declared " that it is in the national security interest of the United States to facilitate on a priority basis the transportation , storage , safeguarding , and destruction of nuclear and other weapons in the Soviet Union , its republics , and any successor entities , and to assist in the prevention of weapons proliferation . "
Congress immediately authorized Bush Senior to " reprogram " up to $ 400 million from funds already appropriated for that fiscal year to the Department of Defense ( DoD ) to implement Nunn - Lugar !
But hold on .
In 1992 , Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense and Paul Wolfowitz was Undersecretary for Policy .
Periodically , the Undersecretary develops for the Secretary a top - secret document entitled Defense Planning Guidance .
The document is supposed to be " threat - driven . "
Once developed and approved , the Secretary issues it to the military Departments and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
It tells them what their " force structure " needs to be as well as the manpower , weapons , equipment , and logistical support that will be required to meet the " threat . "
So when the New York Times revealed in 1992 some contents of Wolfowitz ’s Defense Planning Guidance  which " envisioned a future in which the United States could , and should , prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power "  there was understandably quite a flap , here and abroad , in and out of government .
But surely Cheney - Wolfowitz shared the view of President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker and the Congress that nukes getting into the hands of terrorists was the Number One threat to our national security ?
Surely they were anxious to implement Nunn - Lugar as soon as possible , were n’t they ?
Apparently not then .
Not ever .
But , with Cheney - Wolfowitz gone from the Pentagon , surely incoming President Clinton could proceed to apply correctly and expeditiously the Nunn - Lugar solution to " loose nukes " ; still widely acknowledged to be the Number One Threat to our national security  right ?
Wrong !
For one thing , the Republicans soon took control of both Senate and House and many Republicans were not all that appalled at the Cheney Cabal vision .
As a result , of the billions of " Nunn - Lugar " dollars that have been appropriated over the years , the vast majority of it has been spent by the Pentagon  most of that going to American contractors  with only a small fraction ever being spent in Russia to prevent proliferation of nuclear materials , technology and scientists .
In addition , for the entourage that Clinton brought to power , our national security was not as important as world peace .
For that entourage and its fellow travelers , the thousands of nukes  yea , even the hundreds of nuclear power plants  in our hands were more of a threat to world peace than a few " loose " nukes in the hands of terrorists .
So , instead of pursuing nuke proliferation - prevention with the Russians , Clinton pursued , instead , " a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control " as required by Article VI of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
And if that was n’t enough , taking a page from the Cheney - Wolfowitz 1992 grand strategy , Clinton  with the support of Congress  began pushing the boundaries of NATO eastward , toward the walls of the Kremlin .
Furthermore , at the urging of the Cheney Cabal and human - rights activists , Clinton  with the support of Congress  began bashing the Russians for their efforts to suppress Islamic terrorist activities in Chechnya .
Now , there could have been some good news .
Iraq had agreed , as a condition of the Gulf War ceasefire , to accept UN Security Council sanctions and to allow the IAEA to preside over the complete destruction of all Iraqi nuclear programs , peaceful or otherwise .
By mid-1998 , Director - General ElBaradei was able to report to the Security Council that Iraq ’s nuclear program did not now pose a “ threat to the peace in the region . ”
So , the Security Council should have removed some or all of the sanctions previously imposed .
But No !
President Clinton  with the support of Congress  declared he would never allow sanctions to be lifted , despite the IAEA report that Iraq was in total compliance with its Safeguards Agreement , so long as Saddam Hussein was in power .
Consequently , over the Christmas Holidays , Clinton tried to effect regime change in Iraq from 20,000 feet , claiming he had " intelligence " that Saddam was conducting a nuke development program beneath the palaces he bombed .
Clinton further angered the Russians that year by attempting to achieve regime change in Kosovo - Bosnia from 20,000 feet , killing many thousands of Russia ’s Slavic brethren , the Serbs , on the ground .
Worse , Pakistan surprised everyone that year by testing a half - dozen or so nuclear fission devices , just days after India  defying Clinton  had tested several of their own .
The prospect that the next India - Pakistani conflict would involve  thanks to Clinton  nukes was bad enough .
But nuke - armed Pakistan openly supported the ruling Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan , and the Taliban openly provided refuge to Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda .
What a mess .
So , there we were , eight years ago , thinking that if we Americans could only make the right ’ choices , the next President  working together with the next Congress  could clean up the mess Clinton and a complicit Congress had made of the world , thereby making it safe to once again go abroad carrying an American passport .
My favourite hobby – well , it ’s not really a hobby , just an excuse to get some fresh air – is doing the garden , although it mostly consists of cutting the grass , watering the plants , and following directions on where to place everything !
This survey from MyVoice looked at how the Japanese approached gardening .
Demographics
Over the first five days of August 2008 14,858 members of the MyVoice internet community successfully completed a private internet - based questionnaire .
54 % of the sample were female , 1 % in their teens , 16 % in their twenties , 37 % in their thirties , 28 % in their forties , and 18 % in their fifties .
I wonder if the keenness to grow vegetables is in any way connected with the recent rises in prices of many goods ?
From our garden we get mint and chives , mainly .
We got a Brussels sprout plant but it ’s still to sprout .
Two years ago we planted oba / shiso and got a huge crop ; with 10 leaves costing 80 to 100 yen per pack , and us going through up to 50 per week , 200 yen for a seedling from the garden centre is a wonderful bargain .
We ’ve got a lot of roses , but although they are lovely in the spring , they really suffer in the summer and we ’re just beginning to get some new flowers through , but they ’re barely a quarter of the size !
Oh , and three weeks ago I had great fun relieving stress by hacking a path through two overgrown bushes .

FasTrak is the electronic toll collection system used by the state of California .
Motorists can purchase a toll transponder for ~ $ 26 and link the serial number with a debit account to have their tolls deducted automatically .
Today at Black Hat in Las Vegas , security researcher [ Nate Lawson ] presented not just the privacy problems with FasTrak , but why absolutely no transaction from the tag should be trusted .
On the privacy side , FasTrak claims that all the collected data is anonymized and not kept for long ( they wo n’t tell you how or how long ) .
The court system still subpoenas the data from time to time , so there must be something of use in there .
As AOL taught us , user behavior is incredibly hard to anonymize .
In addition to the toll booths , the transponders are also polled at all offramps for the statistical traffic data presented at 511.org .
[ Nate ] initially purchased a transponder to explore these privacy concerns .
The transponder is an RFID device with a receive and transmit antenna , a low powered Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller , a long life battery , and a large analog demodulation section .
Usually the firmware on the microcontroller can not be read via a JTAG cable , because the manfacturer will burn a fuse to prevent it .
This was not the case with the three year old tag he purchased .
A more recently purchased tag did have the fuse burned .
Flylogic repackaged that silicon so it could be read back ; the firmware turned out exactly the same .
The transponders and readers perform no authentication .
Someone could wander through a parking lot with an RFID reader and pick up the ID of every tag in the lot .
They could then write their own transponder with the stolen IDs .
Here ’s the really bad part : the transponders support unauthenticated over the air upgrading .
You can force any transponder to take on a new ID .
An attacker could overwrite every tag passing a certain intersection and cause havoc in the toll system .
Some have suggested that there are IDs in the system that are unbilled , since they ’re assigned to administrators ; these would be especially attractive to thieves .
How do we fix this system ?
Here ’s the problem : the system is defined by California law .
An update to the way things are done would take legislative action .
[ Nate ] suggested one possible check that could be implemented to determine if the system was being exploited at this time :
When a tag read fails now , the system takes a picture of your license plate so a human can determine what account it belongs to .
The system could be updated to randomly take photos of cars that were reading correctly just to make sure the ID belongs to the car pictured .
As for the privacy issues , [ Nate ] is hoping to develop a timer circuit so you can power up the transponder only during the time you ’re passing through the toll plaza .
In the end though , none of the transactions with these FasTrak transponders can be trusted .

Archaeologists excavating one of the most important Roman sites in Britain have made an " extremely rare " find .
The team digging at part of the Roman fortress in Caerleon near Newport found what they believe is a legionary 's ceremonial lance .
Dr Peter Guest said he thought the iron staff , broken into three pieces , was the first of its type found in the UK .
He also believed it was likely to have belonged to a high - ranking commander who was " not to be tampered with " .
Dr Guest , of Cardiff University , said : " It 's a very unusual find and there 's not more than a dozen of them .
" I do n't know of any of that type in Britain .
" There are a few at fortresses and forts around the Rhine and Danube , the frontiers of the Roman Empire . "
The staff would probably have featured some type of decoration such as plumes , which indicated that the carrier was no ordinary soldier .
He would probably have been on special assignment , perhaps with the legion 's commander or other high - ranking member of the Roman government in Britain .
The artefact was found by a team working at the fortress to try to find out more about what could be a 2,000 - year - old warehouse .
A large trench has been opened over the building , which is thought to have supplied the Roman legion .
The building was discovered during surveys and trial excavations last year .
Caerleon was the main administrative centre for the Roman army in Wales by 74 AD and is one of the most important Roman sites in Britain .
• Site tours take place at 1100 and 1430 BST daily ( except Saturdays ) .

The following is excerpted from Naomi Klein 's recently published book , The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism :
As George Bush and his cabinet took up their posts in January 2001 , the need for new sources of growth for US corporations was an urgent matter .
With the tech bubble now officially popped and the DowJones tumbling 824 points in their first two and half months in office , they found themselves staring in the face of a serious economic downturn .
John Maynard Keynes had argued that governments should spend their way out of recessions , providing economic stimulus with public works .
Bush 's solution was for the government to deconstruct itself - hacking off great chunks of the public wealth and feeding them to corporate America , in the form of tax cuts on the one hand and lucrative contracts on the other .
Bush 's budget director , the think - tank ideologue Mitch Daniels , pronounced : " The general idea - that the business of government is not to provide services , but to make sure that they are provided - seems self - evident to me . "
That assessment included disaster response .
Joseph Allbaugh , the Republican party operative whom Bush put in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) - the body responsible for responding to disasters , including terrorist attacks - described his new place of work as " an oversized entitlement programme " .
Then came 9/11 , and all of a sudden having a government whose central mission was self - immolation did not seem like a very good idea .
With a frightened population wanting protection from a strong , solid government , the attacks could well have put an end to Bush 's project of hollowing out government just as it was beginning .
shock doctrine book cover 1
For a while , that even seemed to be the case .
" September 11 has changed everything , " said Ed Feulner , old friend of Milton Friedman , the guru of unfettered capitalism and president of the Heritage Foundation , 10 days after the attack , making him one of the first to utter the fateful phrase .
Many naturally assumed that part of that change would be a re-evaluation of the radical anti-state agenda that Feulner and his ideological allies had been pushing for three decades , at home and around the world .
After all , the nature of the September 11 security failures exposed the results of more than 20 years of chipping away at the public sector and outsourcing government functions to profit - driven corporations .
Much as the flooding of New Orleans exposed the rotting condition of public infrastructure , the attacks pulled back the curtain on a state that had been allowed to grow dangerously weak : radio communications for the New York City police and firefighters broke down in the middle of the rescue operation , air - traffic controllers did n't notice the off - course planes in time , and the attackers had passed through airport security checkpoints staffed by contract workers , some of whom earned less than their counterparts at the food court .
The first major victory of the Friedmanite counter - revolution in the United States had been Ronald Reagan 's attack on the air - traffic controllers ' union and his deregulation of the airlines .
Twenty years later , the entire air transit system had been privatised , deregulated and downsized , with the vast majority of airport security work performed by underpaid , poorly trained , non-union contractors .
After the attacks , the inspector general of the department of transportation testified that the airlines , which were responsible for security on their flights , had skimped significantly to keep costs down .
On September 10 , as long as flights were cheap and plentiful , none of that seemed to matter .
But on September 12 , putting $ 6 - an - hour contract workers in charge of airport security seemed reckless .
Then , in October , envelopes with white powder were sent to lawmakers and journalists , spreading panic about the possibility of a major anthrax outbreak .
Once again , 90s privatisation looked very different in this new light : why did a private lab have the exclusive right to produce the vaccine against anthrax ?
Had the federal government signed away its responsibility to protect the public from a major public health emergency ?
Furthermore , if it was true , as media reports kept claiming , that anthrax , smallpox and other deadly agents could be spread through the mail , the food supply or the water systems , was it really such a good idea to be pushing ahead with Bush 's plans to privatise the postal service ?
And what about all those laid - off food and water inspectors - could somebody bring them back ?
The backlash against the pro-corporate consensus only deepened in the face of new scandals such as that of Enron .
Three months after the 9/11 attacks , Enron declared bankruptcy , leading thousands of employees to lose their retirement savings while executives acting on insider knowledge cashed in .
The crisis contributed to a general plummeting of faith in private industry to perform essential services , especially when it came out that it was Enron 's manipulation of energy prices that had led to the massive blackouts in California a few months earlier .
Friedman , aged 90 , was so concerned that the tides were shifting back toward Keynesianism that he complained that " businessmen are being presented in the public as second - class citizens " .
While CEOs were falling from their pedestals , unionised public sector workers - the villains of Friedman 's counter - revolution - were rapidly ascending in the public 's estimation .
Within two months of the attacks , trust in government was higher than it had been since 1968 - and that , remarked Bush to a crowd of federal employees , is " because of how you 've performed your jobs " .
The uncontested heroes of September 11 were the blue - collar first responders - the New York firefighters , police and rescue workers , 403 of whom lost their lives as they tried to evacuate the towers and aid the victims .
Suddenly , America was in love with its men and women in all kinds of uniforms , and its politicians - slapping on NYPD and FDNY baseball caps with unseemly speed - were struggling to keep up with the new mood .
When Bush stood with the firefighters and rescue workers at Ground Zero on September 14 he was embracing some of the very unionised civil servants that the modern conservative movement had devoted itself to destroying .
Of course , he had to do it ( even Dick Cheney put on a hard hat in those days ) , but he did n't have to do it so convincingly .
Through some combination of genuine feeling on Bush 's part and the public 's projected desire for a leader worthy of the moment , these were the most moving speeches of Bush 's political career .
For weeks after the attacks , the president went on a grand tour of the public sector - state schools , firehouses and memorials , the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention - embracing and thanking civil servants for their contributions and humble patriotism .
He praised not only emergency services personnel but teachers , postal employees and healthcare workers .
At these events , he treated work done in the public interest with a level of respect and dignity that had not been seen in the US in four decades .
Cost - cutting was suddenly off the agenda , and in every speech the president gave , he announced some ambitious new public programme .
But far from shaking their determination to weaken the public sphere , the security failures of 9/11 reaffirmed in Bush and his inner circle their deepest ideological ( and self - interested ) beliefs - that only private firms possessed the intelligence and innovation to meet the new security challenge .
Although it was true that the White House was on the verge of spending huge amounts of taxpayer money to launch a new deal , it would be exclusively with corporate America , a straight - up transfer of hundreds of billions of public dollars a year into private hands .
The deal would take the form of contracts , many offered secretively , with no competition and scarcely any oversight , to a sprawling network of industries : technology , media , communications , incarceration , engineering , education , healthcare .
What happened in the period of mass disorientation after the attacks was , in retrospect , a domestic form of economic shock therapy .
The Bush team , Friedmanite to the core , quickly moved to exploit the shock that gripped the nation to push through its radical vision of a hollow government in which everything from war fighting to disaster response was a for - profit venture .
It was a bold evolution of shock therapy .
Rather than the 90s approach of selling off existing public companies , the Bush team created a whole new framework for its actions - the war on terror - built to be private from the start .
This feat required two stages .
First , the White House used the omnipresent sense of peril in the aftermath of 9/11 to dramatically increase the policing , surveillance , detention and war - waging powers of the executive branch - a power - grab that the military historian Andrew Bacevich has termed " a rolling coup " .
Then those newly enhanced and richly funded functions of security , invasion , occupation and reconstruction were immediately outsourced , handed over to the private sector to perform at a profit .
Although the stated goal was fighting terrorism , the effect was the creation of the disaster capitalism complex - a fully fledged new economy in homeland security , privatised war and disaster reconstruction tasked with nothing less than building and running a privatised security state , both at home and abroad .
The economic stimulus of this sweeping initiative proved enough to pick up the slack where globalisation and the dotcom booms had left off .
Just as the internet had launched the dotcom bubble , 9/11 launched the disaster capitalism bubble .
" When the IT industry shut down , post - bubble , guess who had all the money ?
The government , " said Roger Novak of Novak Biddle Venture Partners , a venture capitalism firm that invests in homeland security companies .
Now , he says , " Every fund is seeing how big the trough is and asking , ' How do I get a piece of that action ? ' "
It was the pinnacle of the counter - revolution launched by Friedman .
For decades , the market had been feeding off the appendages of the state ; now it would devour the core .
Bizarrely , the most effective ideological tool in this process was the claim that economic ideology was no longer a primary motivator of US foreign or domestic policy .
The mantra " September 11 changed everything " neatly disguised the fact that for free - market ideologues and the corporations whose interests they serve , the only thing that changed was the ease with which they could pursue their ambitious agenda .
Now the Bush White House could use the patriotic alignment behind the president and the free pass handed out by the press to stop talking and start doing .
As the New York Times observed in February 2007 , " Without a public debate or formal policy decision , contractors have become a virtual fourth branch of government . "
And so , in November 2001 , just two months after the attacks , the department of defence brought together what it described as " a small group of venture capitalist consultants " with experience in the dotcom sector .
The mission was to identify " emerging technology solutions that directly assist in the US efforts in the global war on terrorism " .
By early 2006 , this informal exchange had become an official arm of the Pentagon : the Defence Venture Catalyst Initiative ( DeVenCI ) , a " fully operational office " that continually feeds security information to politically connected venture capitalists , who , in turn , scour the private sector for start - ups that can produce new surveillance and related products .
" We 're a search engine , " explains Bob Pohanka , director of DeVenCI .
According to the Bush vision , the role of government is merely to raise the money necessary to launch the new war market , then buy the best products that emerge out of that creative cauldron , encouraging industry to even greater innovation .
In other words , the politicians create the demand , and the private sector supplies all manner of solutions .
The department of homeland security , as a brand - new arm of the state created by the Bush regime , is the clearest expression of this wholly outsourced mode of government .
As Jane Alexander , deputy director of the research wing of the department of homeland security , explained , " We do n't make things .
If it does n't come from industry , we are not going to be able to get it . "
Another is Counterintelligence Field Activity ( Cifa ) , a new intelligence agency created under Donald Rumsfeld that is independent of the CIA .
This parallel spy agency outsources 70 % of its budget to private contractors ; like the department of homeland security , it was built as a hollow shell .
As Ken Minihan , former director of the National Security Agency , explained , " Homeland security is too important to be left to the government . "
Minihan , like hundreds of other Bush administration staffers , has already left his government post to work in the burgeoning homeland security industry , which , as a top spy , he helped create .
Every aspect of the way the Bush administration has defined the parameters of the war on terror has served to maximise its profitability and sustainability as a market - from the definition of the enemy to the rules of engagement to the ever - expanding scale of the battle .
The document that launched the department of homeland security declares , " Today 's terrorists can strike at any place , at any time , and with virtually any weapon , " which conveniently means that the security services required must protect against every imaginable risk in every conceivable place at every possible time .
And it 's not necessary to prove that a threat is real for it to merit a full - scale response - not with Cheney 's famous " 1 % doctrine " , which justified the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that if there is a 1 % chance that something is a threat , it requires that the US respond as if the threat is a 100 % certainty .
This logic has been a particular boon for the makers of various hi-tech detection devices : for instance , because we can conceive of a smallpox attack , the department of homeland security has handed out half a billion dollars to private companies to develop and install detection equipment .
Through all its various name changes - the war on terror , the war on radical Islam , the war against Islamofascism , the third world war , the long war , the generational war - the basic shape of the conflict has remained unchanged .
It is limited by neither time nor space nor target .
From a military perspective , these sprawling and amorphous traits make the war on terror an unwinnable proposition .
But from an economic perspective , they make it an unbeatable one : not a flash - in - the - pan war that could potentially be won but a new and permanent fixture in the global economic architecture .
That was the business prospectus that the Bush administration put before corporate America after September 11 .
The revenue stream was a seemingly bottomless supply of tax dollars to be funnelled from the Pentagon ( $ 270bn in 2005 to private contractors , a $ 137bn increase since Bush took office ) , US intelligence agencies and the newest arrival , the department of homeland security .
Between September 11 2001 and 2006 , the Department of Homeland Security handed out $ 130bn to contractors - money that was not in the private sector before and that is more than the GDP of Chile or the Czech Republic .
In a remarkably short time , the suburbs ringing Washington , DC became dotted with grey buildings housing security " start - ups " and " incubator " companies , hastily thrown together operations where , as in late - 90s Silicon Valley , the money came in faster than the furniture could be assembled .
Whereas in the 90s the goal was to develop the killer application , the " next new new thing " , and sell it to Microsoft or Oracle , now it was to come up with a new " search and nail " terrorist - catching technology and sell it to the department of homeland security or the Pentagon .
That is why , in addition to the start - ups and investment funds , the disaster industry also gave birth to an army of new lobby firms promising to hook up new companies with the right people on Capitol Hill - in 2001 , there were two such security - oriented lobby firms , but by mid-2006 there were 543 .
" I 've been in private equity since the early 90s , " Michael Steed , managing director of the homeland security firm Paladin told Wired , " and I 've never seen a sustained deal flow like this . "
Like the dotcom bubble , the disaster bubble is inflating in an ad-hoc and chaotic fashion .
One of the first booms for the homeland security industry was surveillance cameras , 30 m of which have been installed in the US , shooting about 4bn hours of footage a year .
That created a problem : who 's going to watch 4bn hours of footage ?
So a new market emerged for " analytic software " that scans the tapes and creates matches with images already on file .
This development created another problem , because facial recognition software can really make positive IDs only if people present themselves front and centre to the cameras , which they rarely do while rushing to and from work .
So another market was created for digital image enhancement .
Salient Stills , a company that sells software to isolate and enhance video images , started by pitching its technology to media companies , but it turned out that there was more potential revenue from the FBI and other law - enforcement agencies .
And with all the snooping going on - phone logs , wire - tapping , financial records , mail , surveillance cameras , web surfing - the government is drowning in data , which has opened up yet another massive market in information management and data mining , as well as software that claims to be able to " connect the dots " in this ocean of words and numbers and pinpoint suspicious activity .
In the 90s , tech companies endlessly trumpeted the wonders of the borderless world and the power of information technology to topple authoritarian regimes and bring down walls .
Today , inside the disaster capitalism complex , the tools of the information revolution have been flipped to serve the opposite purpose .
In the process , mobile phones and web surfing have been turned into powerful tools of mass state surveillance by increasingly authoritarian regimes , with the cooperation of privatised phone companies and search engines , whether it 's Yahoo assisting the Chinese government to pinpoint the location of dissidents or AT&T helping the US National Security Agency to wiretap its customers without a warrant ( a practice that the Bush administration claims it has discontinued ) .
The dismantling of borders , the great symbol and promise of globalisation , has been replaced with the exploding industry of border surveillance , from optical scanning and biometric IDs to the planned hi-tech fence on the border between Mexico and the US , worth up to $ 2.5 bn for Boeing and a consortium of other companies .
As hi-tech firms have jumped from one bubble to another , the result has been a bizarre merger of security and shopping cultures .
Many technologies in use today as part of the war on terror - biometric identification , video surveillance , web tracking , data mining - had been developed by the private sector before September 11 as a way to build detailed customer profiles , opening up new vistas for micromarketing .
When widespread discomfort about big - brother technologies stalled many of these initiatives , it caused dismay to both marketers and retailers .
September 11 loosened this log jam in the market : suddenly the fear of terror was greater than the fear of living in a surveillance society .
So now , the same information collected from cash cards or " loyalty " cards can be sold not only to a travel agency or the Gap as marketing data but also to the FBI as security data , flagging a " suspicious " interest in pay - as - you - go mobile phones and Middle Eastern travel .
As an exuberant article in the business magazine Red Herring explained , one such program " tracks terrorists by figuring out if a name spelled a hundred different ways matches a name in a homeland security database .
Take the name Mohammad .
The software contains hundreds of possible spellings for the name , and it can search terabytes of data in a second . "
Impressive , unless they nail the wrong Mohammad , which often seems to happen , from Iraq to Afghanistan to the suburbs of Toronto .
This potential for error is where the incompetence and greed that have been the hallmark of the Bush years , from Iraq to New Orleans , becomes harrowing .
One false identification coming out of any of these electronic fishing expeditions is enough for an apolitical family man , who sort of looks like someone whose name sort of sounds like his ( at least to someone with no knowledge of Arabic or Muslim culture ) , to be flagged as a potential terrorist .
And the process of putting names and organisations on watch lists is also now handled by private companies , as are the programs to crosscheck the names of travellers with the names in the data bank .
As of June 2007 , there were half a million names on a list of suspected terrorists kept by the National Counterterrorism Centre .
Another program , the Automated Targeting System ( ATS ) , made public in November 2006 , has already assigned a " risk assessment " rating to tens of millions of travellers passing through the US .
The rating , never disclosed to passengers , is based on suspicious patterns revealed through commercial data mining - for instance , information provided by airlines about " the passenger 's history of one - way ticket purchase , seat preferences , frequent - flyer records , number of bags , how they pay for tickets and even what meals they order " .
Incidents of supposedly suspicious behaviour are tallied up to generate each passenger 's risk rating .
Anyone can be blocked from flying , denied an entry visa to the US or even arrested and named as an " enemy combatant " based on evidence from these dubious technologies - a blurry image identified through facial recognition software , a misspelled name , a misunderstood snippet of a conversation .
If " enemy combatants " are not US citizens , they will probably never even know what it was that convicted them , because the Bush administration has stripped them of habeas corpus , the right to see the evidence in court , as well as the right to a fair trial and a vigorous defence .
If the suspect is taken , as a result , to Guantánamo , he may well end up in the new 200 - person maximum - security prison constructed by Halliburton .
If he is a victim of the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " programme , kidnapped off the streets of Milan or while changing planes at a US airport , then whisked to a so - called black site somewhere in the CIA 's archipelago of secret prisons , the hooded prisoner will likely fly in a Boeing 737 , designed as a deluxe executive jet , retrofitted for this purpose .
According to the New Yorker , Boeing has been acting as the " CIA 's travel agent " - blocking out flightplans for as many as 1,245 rendition voyages , arranging ground crews and even booking hotels .
A Spanish police report explains that the work was done by Jeppesen International Trip Planning , a Boeing subsidiary in San Jose .
In May 2007 , the American Civil Liberties Union launched a lawsuit against the Boeing subsidiary ; the company has refused to confirm or deny the allegations .
Once the prisoners arrive at the destination , they face interrogators , some of whom will not be employed by the CIA or the military but by private contractors .
According to Bill Golden , who runs the job website IntelligenceCareers.com , " Over half of the qualified counter - intelligence experts in the field work for contractors . "
If these freelance interrogators are to keep landing lucrative contracts , they must extract from prisoners the kind of " actionable intelligence " their employers in Washington are looking for .
It 's a dynamic ripe for abuse : just as prisoners under torture will usually say anything to make the pain stop , contractors have a powerful economic incentive to use whatever techniques are necessary to produce the sought - after information , regardless of its reliability .
Then there is the low - tech version of this application of market " solutions " to the war on terror - the willingness to pay top dollar to pretty much anyone for information about alleged terrorists .
During the invasion of Afghanistan , US intelligence agents let it be known that they would pay anywhere from $ 3,000 to $ 25,000 for al - Qaida or Taliban fighters handed over to them .
" Get wealth and power beyond your dreams , " stated a typical flyer handed out by the US in Afghanistan , introduced as evidence in a 2002 US federal court filing on behalf of several Guantánamo prisoners .
" You can receive millions of dollars helping the anti-Taliban forces ... This is enough money to take care of your family , your village , your tribe for the rest of your life . "
Soon enough , the cells of Bagram and Guantánamo were overflowing with goat herders , cab drivers , cooks and shopkeepers - all lethally dangerous , according to the men who turned them over and collected the rewards .
According to the Pentagon 's own figures , 86 % of the prisoners at Guantánamo were handed over by Afghan and Pakistani fighters or agents after the bounties were announced .
As of December 2006 , the Pentagon had released 360 prisoners from Guantánamo ( out of 759 held between 2001 and the end of 2006 ) .
The Associated Press was able to track down 245 of them ; 205 had been freed or cleared of all charges when they returned to their home countries .
It is a track record that is a grave indictment of the quality of intelligence produced by the administration 's market - based approach to terrorist identification .
In just a few years , the homeland security industry , which barely existed before 9/11 , has exploded to a size that is now significantly larger than either Hollywood or the music business .
Yet what is most striking is how little the security boom is analysed and discussed as an economy , as an unprecedented convergence of unchecked police powers and unchecked capitalism , a merger of the shopping mall and the secret prison .
When information about who is or is not a security threat is a product to be sold as readily as information about who buys Harry Potter books on Amazon or who has taken a Caribbean cruise and might enjoy one in Alaska , it changes the values of a culture .
Not only does it create an incentive to spy , torture and generate false information , but it creates a powerful impetus to perpetuate the fear and sense of peril that created the industry in the first place .
When new economies emerged in the past , from the Fordist revolution to the IT boom , they sparked a flood of analysis and debate about how such seismic shifts in the production of wealth were also altering the way we as a culture worked , the way we travelled , even the way our brains process information .
The new disaster economy has been subject to none of this kind of far - reaching discussion .
There have been and are debates , of course - about the constitutionality of the Patriot Act , about indefinite detention , about torture and extraordinary rendition - but discussion of what it means to have these functions performed as commercial transactions has been almost completely avoided .
What passes for debate is restricted to individual cases of war profiteering and corruption scandals , as well as the usual hand - wringing about the failure of government to adequately oversee private contractors - rarely about the much broader and deeper phenomenon of what it means to be engaged in a fully privatised war built to have no end .
Part of the problem is that the disaster economy sneaked up on us .
In the 80s and 90s , new economies announced themselves with great pride and fanfare .
The tech bubble in particular set a precedent for a new ownership class inspiring deafening levels of hype - endless media lifestyle profiles of dashing young CEOs beside their private jets , their remote - controlled yachts , their idyllic Seattle mountain homes .
That kind of wealth is being generated by the disaster complex today , though we rarely hear about it .
While the CEOs of the top 34 defence contractors saw their incomes go up an average of 108 % between 2001 and 2005 , chief executives at other large American companies averaged only 6 % over the same period .
Peter Swire , who served as the US government 's privacy counsellor during the Clinton administration , describes the convergence of forces behind the war on terror bubble like this :
" You have government on a holy mission to ramp up information gathering and you have an information technology industry desperate for new markets . "
In other words , you have corporatism : big business and big government combining their formidable powers to regulate and control the citizenry .
A new generation of personal computers on the way from Apple Inc. may sport some of the most significant architectural changes since the Mac maker made the jump from PowerPC processors to those manufactured by Intel Corp. , AppleInsider has learned .
As part of its move to Intel chips in early 2006 , the Cupertino - based company largely abandoned its practice of using custom motherboard chipsets to support the primary CPU in its Macs .
Instead , it began to rely on slightly tweaked versions of industry - standard chipsets offered by Intel to the broad range of PC manufacturers that develop Intel - powered systems .
For instance , while Apple 's existing line of MacBook and MacBook Pro notebooks are unique in that they run the Mac OS X operating system , they 're architecturally based on the same run -of - the - mill processors and chipsets from Intel 's Santa Rosa mobile platform also employed by Windows - supporting rivals , such as Dell and HP .
However , with Apple striving to maintain Mac sales growth of more than two times the industry average , it 's again looking to differentiate the architecture of its personal computer systems through alternative technology that will afford it an advantage beyond the reach of its competition .
As such , people familiar with these plans say an upcoming generation of Macs , lead by a trio of redesigned notebooks , wo n't adopt the Montevina chipset announced as part of Intel 's Centrino 2 mobile platform earlier this month .
What 's more , those same people suggest the chipset employed by the new wave of Macs may have little or nothing to do with Intel at all .
( This should not be confused with the primary CPU , which will continue to come from Intel . )
Exactly what alternative Apple has chosen remains unclear .
However it 's believed that Intel , which declined to comment for this story , would need to have established a licensing agreement with the firm responsible for manufacturing an Intel - compatible chipset , be it Apple or one of the company 's third party suppliers .
Assuming the chipsets in the new Macs are not based on Intel technology , that would leave Apple with only a handful of viable options .
The company could return to a practice common during the years of PowerPC - based Macs in which it developed proprietary chipsets to support the primary processors in its systems .
Another option is that Apple could forge a relationship with one of the other established third party chipset manufacturers , such as NVidia , AMD or Via , in a move that would allow the company to build its next - generation systems using technology cherry - picked from the best of both worlds .
A move by Apple away from Intel chipsets may also be tied to concerns over the power - hungry nature of the chipmaker 's more recent mobile chipsets .
The Mac maker has been working to reduce the size and weight of its notebook offerings while simultaneously extending battery life and introducing new features not accessible to its rivals .
During a recent quarterly conference call , Apple chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer uncharacteristically made references to ongoing investments in new product technologies that would pressure the company 's profit margins but leave competitors scrambling by the side of the road .
" We have some investments in front of us that I canât discuss with you today where weâre going to be delivering state of the art new products that our competitors just arenât going to be able to match , " he said , " and as a result , I would see gross margins being about 30 percent and thatâs â thatâs all I can tell you at this point . "
Since Apple 's new Mac notebooks are n't necessarily following the same rollout schedule as competitive offerings based purely on standard Centrino 2 components , people familiar with the next - generation systems say it will be at least another 6 to 8 weeks before the company makes an official announcement .

The Smith Sisters is a scary urban legend about two young girls who were murdered amonymously while they slept in their bedroom .
There was a boy named John Smith who lived in Plainfield , Wisconsin .
He was very fond of scary e-mails and popups .
Every day , he would find new ones and send them to everyone he knew .
He even started making some himself and sending them to strangers .
He loved to scare people on the Internet .
One day in November 2007 , he opened up his Inbox and found a message that appeared to be from two young girls .
They called themselves “ The Smith Sisters ” and told him they were his older sisters , which confused him because he was an only child .
They also said that , years ago , they had lived in his house .
He replied , saying he did n’t have any sisters and told them to get lost and leave him alone .
The next day , he received a chilling message with some photo attachments .
The first photo was of two young girls .
The caption on it said Smith Sisters Murdered Anonymously
In the e-mail , the girls said that they were indeed his older sisters .
They told him that in 1993 they had lived in his house .
His bedroom had once been their bedroom .
They told him all about growing up and about their lives and how happy they had been until one horrible night .
He opened up the other attachment .
It was a scan of an old newspaper article .
“ In 1993 , two sisters were brutally murdered in the small - town community of Plainfield , Wisconsin .
Lisa Smith , 19 and her sister , Sarah Smith , 15 were attacked in their parent ’s home on the night of November 17th , around 1:30 AM .
The Smith Sisters were lying in bed when a crazed killer broke into the house .
No - one heard them scream .
In the morning , their parents found the dead bodies of the Smith Sisters hidden in the bedroom closet .
They had been skinned alive .
The killer was long gone and no trace of him could be found .
They had been murdered anonymously .
Police conducted an extensive investigation , but to no avail .
The motives for the attack were never discovered , nor was the attacker ever found .
The only lead athorities had was a series of strange emails found in Lisa ’s computer .
The case was closed in October of 2000 . ”
In the rest of the email , the sisters said that they were angry that the case was closed and people forgot about them .
They were angry that their parents wanted to forget about them too .
They were angry that their parents decided to start over and had a new baby .
A little boy named John .
They were angry that their parents had never mentioned their daughters or their tragic murder to their new son John .
John Smith , sent an angry reply saying he did n’t believe what they were saying .
He did n’t believe the Smith Sisters were really related to him and he did n’t believe the newspaper article was real .
He told them to go to hell .
Five minutes later , he got another email from them .
It said “ If you do n’t believe us , look in the bedroom closet . ”
That was the last email that was found on John ’s computer .
Police were unable to trace who had sent the messages to him .
On the floor of the closet , the police found a faint message , carved in the wood .
It simply read “ Lisa and Sarah – 1993 ” .
Underneath that , was another carving that read “ John 2007 ” .
No - one knows what John did next , but in the morning , John ’s parents woke up to find their son missing .
Then they checked his bedroom closet and got the shock of their lives .
There they found the dead body of their son .
He had been skinned alive .
No - one knows what really happened that night .
Police were only able to piece together parts of the story based on what they found on John ’s computer .
The parents were devastated .
How could this happen to a family .
First their daughters were murdered .
And now years later their son is murdered .
It seemed too weird to be just a coincidence .
Two sisters are murdered and then years later , their brother is murdered in exactly the same way , in exactly the same place .
And the only evidence left behind is a few scary emails …
Makes you wonder .

Because the Bible Tells Me So ?
Creationist tours of museum and zoo teach that evolution is " pseudo - science . "
March 19 , 2008  --
Standing in the lobby of the Denver Museum of Nature & Science , Bill Jack and Rusty Carter pointed to the enormous teeth on the reproduced skeleton of a Tyrannosaurs Rex , and told a group of children and their parents that the fearsome T - Rex was really a vegetarian .
They said the T - Rex was vegetarian because at the time of the Creation , there was no such thing as death , so a T - Rex could not have eaten meat .
There was no death until Adam and Eve ate forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge , they continued , and God 's revenge was to curse the world with death .
Jack asked , " If this creature was designed to eat meat from the very start , what would he have to do until Adam and Eve sinned and death entered the world ?
What would he have to do ? "
The children replied in chorus , " Starve . "
" Fast and pray for The Fall .
Is that likely ? "
Jack asked .
" The answer is , everyone look at me and say , ' No . '
Try that with me . ' "
" No ! " the children replied .
Jesus : The Designer and Creator
Jack and Carter operate what they call BC Tours : " BC " stands for Biblically Correct .
They take paying customers on tours of such places as the Denver Museum , the zoo , and fossil sites , giving an explanation of nature , biology and paleontology with a strictly Biblical interpretation .
They lead 100 tours a year and have reached thousands of children since starting their company in 1988 .
" We believe Jesus is our designer and our creator of everything that was ever made , " Carter tells the group of about 30 home - schooled Christian children and parents .
Known as " young Earth creationists , " Jack and Carter say the Bible tells them Earth is only 6,000 to 10,000 years old .
In the scientific community , the earth is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old .
Jack and Carter describe both Creationism and the theory of evolution as " philosophies " and " world views " that are essentially on a par with each other ; it 's just a question of which you choose .
They believe that the life that populates Earth is not the product of billions of years of evolution , but created by God in six 24 hour days .
And they believe Adam and Eve walked the Earth with dinosaurs , and that all the dinosaur fossils found all over the world are probably the result of one catastrophic event , such as Noah 's flood , and not 4.5 billion years of life and death .
A 2007 Gallup Poll found that more Americans accept the theory of creationism than evolution .
When those surveyed were asked about their views on the origins of life , 66 percent said creation , defined as " the idea that God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years , " is probably or definitely true .
In comparison , 53 percent said evolution , defined as " the idea that human beings developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life , " is probably or definitely true .
Carter asked the children , " Is evolution a religion ? " and they replied " Yes . "
" Yes it 's a religious belief , " Carter said .
" It 's a philosophy . "
' Propaganda '
They dismiss much of what 's on display in the museum as " pseudo - science " and describe many of the graphic depictions of paleontology and evolution as merely " artwork . "
Standing before a display on " Life in the Cenozoic Seas , " Jack told the group , " This is a great museum if they would take out the propaganda , if they take out the pseudo - science .
It 's appalling because students go away thinking that cows turned into whales . "
They deride the notion that anything so complex as the human eye could be the result of random mutations , or that the scales of a fish could over millions of years become teeth .
" This is a fairy tale , " Jack declared to the children .
" How do they know your teeth evolved from scales ?
Everybody , try that with me , how do you know ?
" How - do - you - know ? " the kids repeated in unison .
At another exhibit , Carter pointed to a fossil of a giant fish found in Kansas and said , " Who likes to fish ?
Who would believe you could catch a fish this big in Kansas ? "
The tours are tolerated but not sponsored by the museum .
" They selectively ignore the vast majority of science in their presentation , " said paleontologist and Chief Curator Kirk Johnson .
Johnson , who was raised in a creationist household and taught to believe that the world was only 6,000 years old , said that personal observation and a long education have taught him that evolution is the only way that biology makes sense .
" All of science understands that evolution is a central tenet of biology , " Johnson said .
" That 's how biology makes sense .
That 's how we make better medicines .
That 's how we understand food crops .
" If you want to map out life through time , the fossil record is really great for doing that , " he continued .
" There 's a really nice record of what happened on this planet from the first real life forms we know of about 3.4 billion years ago until today . "
Out on the museum floor , Jack and Carter stopped the group in front of a window display that contains samples of sandstone that have ripples created by water and fossils of ancient life .
Bill Jack asked his group , " How do they date the fossil ?
By the layer in which they find it .
They date the layer by the fossil and the fossil by the layer , " he said .
" That 's circular reasoning . "
In the next moment he stepped past and turned his back to a display on radiometric dating , the method by which scientists determine the age of rocks through the rate of decay of their natural radioactivity .
When later asked why he skipped the display , Jack said simply , " We can't cover everything . "
Inside the museum 's expansive bone and fossil storage room , Johnson said , " They have no clue about how accurate it is … Now it 's plus or minus a tenth of a percent . "
Preaching to the Choir
Jack and Carter are usually preaching to an agreeable audience .
Many of their customers also are creationists , some looking for ways to further instruct their children or bolster their own beliefs .
Stacia Martin , who brought her 14 - year - old son Shawn , said she had learned how to defend her faith in Jesus Christ .
" I learned that when you look at exhibits , do n't take them at face value just because they 're exciting looking or because they 're interesting , " she said .
Her son Shawn said he thinks the world is 10,000 years old , " Because the Bible says that . "
According to Johnson there are benefits to the BC Tours , even if children are given a message diametrically opposed to what the museum presents .
" Regardless of what the tour guide is saying , some of those kids are going to start thinking for themselves , " Johnson said .
Jack and Carter said that 's exactly what they are teaching : that people should think for themselves , but think within a framework of Creationist belief .
They say that life makes sense if you believe that God created all life , and man in his own image .
Otherwise , Jack said , " It is naturalism .
All there really is , is nature , and everything comes from nature .
And yes , that is antithetical to a supernaturalist world view , if you will , that there is a God who created , put order into the universe . "
Jack and Carter are now training other people around the country to hold similar tours at their local museums , and they are also putting together tour materials for Christian teachers .
" I 've chosen to believe the God of the Bible , " said Jack .
" Now the evolutionist has chosen not to believe the God of the Bible .
So we 've chosen to believe they 're both matters of faith . "

Hummer bummer : Rising gasoline prices threaten to drive some automotive dinosaurs to extinction
The love affair between suburban Americans and fuel guzzling sport utility vehicles survived environmental guilt trips , but it seems to be foundering on the rocks of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline .
Perhaps the ultimate symbol of excessive consumption , the 10 mpg General Motors Hummer , is living on borrowed time after sales of large vehicles plummeted in the past few months .
The massive , boxy Hummer has its devoted fans , but to others it seems more appropriate as an armored vehicle in a war zone than a conveyance for picking up the kids or shopping .
Also endangered are the oversized pickup trucks that have become so popular with urban cowpokes .
Sales of Ford 's once dominant F - Series pickup dropped 42 percent from last May 's figures , and the pickup was outsold in the United States for the first time by energy efficient Toyota and Honda sedans .
With sales down 30 percent last month and suffering a $ 3.3 billion loss in the first quarter , GM 's chairman and chief executive , Rick Wagoner , delivered the eulogy for big vehicles .
He declared that cheap gas is a thing of the past and that the largest American automaker will close four U.S. plants that produce full - sized SUVs and pickups .
That will at least temporarily put 8,000 employees out of work .
GM will now pursue its Asian competitors by turning to production of smaller sedans and hybrid vehicles .
GM officials say they are considering selling the Hummer brand to anyone who 's interested .
Perhaps a ruler of a nation awash in cheap gasoline — say a Saudi prince or a Venezuelan autocrat — will take GM up on it .
It seems that the only way to convince America 's automakers to go green is to make the nation 's drivers see red at the gas pump .
An artist rendering of the distant world Sedna , with the sun little more than a faraway star .
A new study suggests Sedna may not be alone .
An icy , unknown world might lurk in the distant reaches of our solar system beyond the orbit of Pluto , according to a new computer model .
The hidden world -- thought to be much bigger than Pluto based on the model -- could explain unusual features of the Kuiper Belt , a region of space beyond Neptune littered with icy and rocky bodies .
Its existence would satisfy the long - held hopes and hypotheses for a " Planet X " envisioned by scientists and sci - fi buffs alike .
" Although the search for a distant planet in the solar system is old , it is far from over , " said study team member Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University in Japan .
The model , created by Lykawka and Kobe University colleague Tadashi Mukai , is detailed in a recent issue of Astrophysical Journal .
If the new world is confirmed , it would not be technically a planet .
Under a controversial new definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) last week , it would instead be the largest known " plutoid . "
The Kuiper Belt contains many peculiar features that can't be explained by standard solar system models .
One is the highly irregular orbits of some of the belt 's members .
The most famous is Sedna , a rocky object located three times farther from the sun than Pluto .
Sedna takes 12,000 years to travel once around the Sun , and its orbit ranges from 80 to 100 astronomical units ( AU ) .
One AU is equal to the distance between the Earth and the Sun .
According to the model , Sedna and other Kuiper Belt oddities could be explained by a world 30 to 70 percent as massive as Earth orbiting between 100 AU and 200 AU from the sun .
At that distance , any water on the world 's surface would be completely frozen .
However , it might support a subsurface ocean like those suspected to exist on the moons Titan and Enceladus , said Mark Sykes , director of the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona .
" The interesting thing for me is the suggestion of the kinds of very interesting objects that may yet await discovery in the outer solar system , " said Sykes , who was not involved in the study .
" We are still scratching the edges of that region of the solar system , and I expect many surprises await us with the future deeper surveys . "

30 - ft. - high rat may greet Lieberman at GOP Convention Diane Sweet
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008

If some Connecticut Democrats get their way , Sen. Joe Lieberman will be greeted at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota by a gigantic inflatable rat .
Stamford 's
The Advocate reports : Joseph Lieberman might want to pack some rodenticide if he decides to stump for John McCain at the upcoming Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn .
Some of the same Connecticut Democrats who stalked the senator on the re-election trail two years ago with the famous " kiss " float - a papier mache likeness of President Bush kissing Lieberman after the 2005 State of the Union address - are hoping to make a similar splash at the GOP fete Sept. 1 - 4 .
If Lieberman 's detractors get their way , their prop would be a 30 - foot inflatable rat , the kind unions typically use when construction workers cross picket lines .
" The 30 - foot rat is a big rat .
A 12 - foot rat you can kind of put in the back of a pickup truck A 30 - foot rat you have to put on the back of a flatbed , " said Ed Anderson , a New Haven Democrat who helped start the Web site DumpJoe.com .
A spokeswoman for Lieberman , who has broken party ranks to endorse McCain , said the self - described independent Democrat has n't been invited to the GOP convention .
" At this time , there are no plans ( to attend ) , " said Erika Masonhall , Lieberman 's press secretary .
Lieberman outraged many Nutmeg State Democrats when he came out in support of his longtime friend McCain for president .
To many of them , the move was the latest insult to the party by the man they call a " Democrat in name only . "
Raw Story 's Michael Roston reported in February of this year that aides to the Connecticut senator said it was " quite possible " that Lieberman would attend the GOP convention in the Twin Cities amid rumors he might seek to join McCain 's ticket as VP : Speculation emerged in some news reports that Lieberman might seek to join McCain 's ticket .
But the Connecticut senator quashed those rumors at the end of January when he suggested that if McCain asked him to run as vice president , he 'd say , " Thanks , John , I 've been there , I 've done that .
You can find much better , " according to the AP .
At the same time , Lieberman began hinting that he'd " be more welcome " at the Republican National Convention than at the Democrats '
August nominating confab .
And moves this past week might have pushed him over the edge .
Last week , Lieberman was stripped of his " superdelegate " status , which granted him a guaranteed vote for a Democratic candidate in Denver .
Under the so - called " Zell Miller " rule , named for the Georgia senator who spoke out against John Kerry and his fellow Democrats at the 2004 RNC , Lieberman 's endorsement of a Republican candidate makes him ineligible to vote at the DNC .
Anderson warns Lieberman not to show up at the convention , as he 's ready to apply for permits to put the inflatable rat outside the Xcel Energy Center , the convention site .
The following video is from " The Kiss " float at the Fourth of July 's Boom Box Parade in 2006 in Sen .
Lieberman 's home state , built by supporters of Lieberman 's then - opponent Ned Lamont :
Systematic partisan - influenced hiring by the Department of Justice was revealed Monday following the release of an audit by the Justice Department 's Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility .
The report revealed that several aides to former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales selected Justice Department employees , including career prosecutors , based on their partisan preferences , therefore violating Federal Law .
The report focuses on the hiring practice of White House liaison for Gonzalez , Monica Goodling , who " improperly subjected candidates for certain career positions to the same politically based evaluation she used on candidates for political positions , " the report read .
" This resulted in high - quality candidates for important department positions being rejected because of improper political considerations , " Inspector General Glenn Fine said .
Allegations of intervention by the Bush administration into the Justice Department have been a topic of significant debate on Capitol Hill following the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 .
The scandal culminated in the resignation of Bush loyalist and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in September 2007 .
His successor , current Attorney General Michael Mukasey , said he was " disturbed " with the findings .
" I have said many times , both to members of the public and to department employees , it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees , " he said in a statement .
Mukasey said that the Justice Department has since taken steps to ensure that similar discriminatory hiring practices will not happen in the future .
" Over the course of the last year and a half , the Justice Department has made many institutional changes to remedy the problems discussed in today 's report , and the report itself commends these changes , " he said .
" It is crucial that the American people have confidence in the propriety of what we do and how we do it , and I will continue my efforts to make certain they can have such confidence . "
In June , a report from the DOJ and OPR unveiled a screening program that rejected DOJ applicants who were liberal or had Democratic ties regardless of experience .
Instead , those hired tended to be Republicans , often rookies with far less experience than their Democratic counterparts .
" Troubling " is the term Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy used to describe the June report .
" It confirms our findings and our fears that the same senior Department officials involved with the firing of United States Attorneys were injecting improper political motives into the process of hiring young attorneys , " the Vermont Democrat said in a statement .
" I suspect further reports from the Inspector General will continue to shed light on the extent to which the Bush administration has allowed to affect - and infect - the Department 's priorities , from law enforcement to the operation of the crucial Civil Rights Division to the Department 's hiring practices , " he added .
The reports are part of a wider investigation by the Justice Department into the Bush administration 's firing of the nine attorney generals , including the role of partisan politics in certain cases such as voting and civil rights cases .
However , Gonzales maintains that he was unaware of any partisan - influenced hiring , a point the report did not dispute .
" It 's simply not possible for any cabinet officer to be completely aware of and micromanage the activities of staffers , particularly where they do n't inform him of what 's going on , " the former Attorney General 's lawyer George Terwilliger III said in a statement .
The White House was similarly dismissive , with spokesman Tony Fratto saying , " There really is not a lot new here . "
Neither Goodling nor Kyle Sampson , another aide under fire , will face departmental penalties because they no longer work at the Justice Department .
Additionally , the report gives no indication whether anyone involved in the discriminatory hiring will face any charges .

We all know that the bioweapons expert who actually drafted the current bioweapons law ( the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 ) – Francis Boyle – has said that he is convinced the October 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people were perpetrated and covered up by criminal elements of the U.S. government , and that the motive was to foment a police state by killing off and intimidating opposition to post - 9/11 legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the later Military Commissions Act .
But a new article reveals an interesting fact : Professor Boyle " advised the FBI in its initial investigation of the anthrax letters . "
In other words , an FBI advisor himself believes that the anthrax attack was a false flag operation .

High - powered automatic weapons and ammunition are flowing virtually unchecked from border states into Mexico , fueling a war among drug traffickers , the army and police that has left thousands dead , according to U.S. and Mexican officials .
The munitions are hidden under trucks and stashed in the trunks of cars , or concealed under the clothing of people who brazenly walk across the international bridges .
They are showing up in seizures and in the aftermath of shootouts between the cartels and police in Mexico .
More than 90 % of guns seized at the border or after raids and shootings in Mexico have been traced to the United States , according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Last year , 2,455 weapons traces requested by Mexico showed that guns had been purchased in the United States , according to the ATF .
Texas , Arizona and California accounted for 1,805 of those traced weapons .
No one is sure how many U.S. - purchased guns have made their way into Mexico , but U.S. authorities estimate the number in the thousands .

The body count , meanwhile , is rising .
Since a military - led crackdown on narcotics traffickers began 18 months ago , more than 4,000 people in Mexico have died in drug - related violence , including 450 police officers , soldiers and prosecutors , as well as innocent bystanders , cartel members and corrupt officials , according to Mexican authorities .
Tom Mangan , a senior ATF special agent in Arizona , compared the flow to reverse osmosis .
“ Just like the drugs that head north , ” firearms move south , he said .
“ The cartels are outfitting an army . ”
More than 6,700 licensed gun dealers have set up shop within a short drive of the 2,000 - mile border , from the Gulf Coast of Texas to San Diego -- which amounts to more than three dealers for every mile of border territory .
Law enforcement has come to call the region an “ iron river of guns . ”
And while U.S. political leaders and presidential candidates have focused rhetoric , money and time on stemming the northward flow of drugs and illegal immigrants , far less has been said and done about arms flowing south , largely from states with liberal gun laws , into a nation where only police and the military can legally own a firearm .

Mexican authorities have been pressing the United States to do more to help a border force they describe as overwhelmed and often intimidated .
“ Just guarantee me that arms wo n’t enter Mexico , ” Mexico ’s public - safety chief , Genaro Garcia Luna , told a radio interviewer recently .
Stop the flow of guns from the United States , he said , “ and the gasoline for the crimes that we have will run out . ”
‘ Straw buyers ’
Both sides blame “ straw buyers ” who purchase weapons for traffickers at small gun shops and large gun shows .

Adan Rodriguez , 35 , a struggling carpet - layer from the Dallas area , told gun dealers he was a private security officer and bought more than 100 assault rifles , 9 - mm handguns and other high - powered weapons at multiple shops over several months , according to court records .
But authorities say drug traffickers were giving him stacks of cash to buy the guns , with marijuana laced in between the bills .
He earned $ 30 to $ 40 a gun , according to court records .
“ The temptation got over me , ” Rodriguez told a federal judge in Dallas , who sentenced him in 2006 to 5 1/2 years in prison .
Last August , U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents in Roma , Texas , came upon a 1999 Freightliner tractor - trailer with a hidden stash of weapons , including a rifle , four shotguns , a handgun and 8,024 rounds of live ammunition with 10 magazines .
The driver was questioned , and that investigation continues .

In February , five men , including a father and his two sons , were arrested just outside Roma and charged with selling as many as 60 guns , silencers and other weapons .
The serial numbers on some of the weapons were shaved off , government evidence shows -- a sign to agents that the firearms were destined for Mexican gangs .
More recently , the ATF seized 13 AK - 47 rifles Aug. 1 from an alleged straw purchaser in Phoenix , according to Mangan .
The guns were to be delivered to the Tijuana cartel via Southern California , Mangan said .
Despite the arrests , smugglers appear to have the upper hand , U.S. and Mexican law enforcement sources say .
Just 100 U.S. firearms agents and 35 inspectors patrol the vast border region for gun smugglers , compared with 16,000 Border Patrol agents , most of them working the Southwest border .
Elias Bazan , a supervisory agent with the ATF in Laredo , Texas , has a staff of just six agents at one of the grittiest stretches along the Rio Grande .

“ I do n’t have an analyst , ” he said .
“ I do n’t have an administrative assistant .
I do n’t have an inspector .
One major case can soak up my entire office .
And we have major cases all the time . ”
Gun dealers also far outnumber agents .
Here in tiny Sierra Vista , on a rise high enough to afford a view into Mexico , half a dozen dealers operate in stores along the town ’s main thoroughfare , and they also sell and trade arms out of their homes .
Arizona is a wide - open state for gun lovers : A license lets you carry a gun openly on the street or concealed .
Saguaro Firearms is a small , crowded shop on East Fry Boulevard , a strip of fast - food restaurants and mini-malls .
Across the street is Guns & Gear .
Anyone with proper ID and a brief background check can leave with a firearm under his or her belt and reach Mexico in minutes .

The manager at Saguaro Firearms , who gave his name only as Greg , carries a “ comfortable to shoot ” silver Kahr P40 in a black holster on his right hip .
“ I do n’t believe all the hype ” about all the guns getting into Mexico , he said , knifing open new boxes of ammunition .
He said that toll bridges , a fence and more border cops would not stop immigrants from flowing north or guns from flowing south .
“ Build a tower with an armed guard every 100 yards , ” he suggested .
“ Maybe then . ”
Washington and Mexico City are pledging cooperation to halt the weapons flow , but each capital wants more from the other .
Washington is urging Mexican officials to be more vigilant at the border , and to thoroughly inspect and arrest crossers who carry weapons from the United States .
Warning signs have been posted at the border , but few people pay heed .
Advertisement
William Hoover , the ATF ’s assistant director for field operations , told Congress that his agency is working with Mexican law enforcement officials on an “ eTrace ” system to track guns found in Mexico .
The process allows the United States to start criminal investigations against anyone in the country who has sent a weapon to Mexico .
Mexico wants the United States to tighten gun laws in border states .
They also want more checks on “ straw man ” purchasers like Rodriguez .

Since weapons began heading south in bulk three to five years ago , U.S. agents have made some key arrests .
Unfortunately , many of them came after the weapons had been used in cartel warfare in Mexico .

This spring the ATF arrested a dealer and two others from the X - Caliber Guns store in Phoenix , which allegedly dispatched hundreds of AK - 47s and other long guns and pistols to Mexico .
The shop has since shut down ; the three have pleaded not guilty .
ATF intelligence has shown that some of the firearms sold from X - Caliber were used by cartel gunmen against Mexican police and the Mexican army .
Six guns were traced to alleged members of the Sinaloa Cartel , who were rounded up shortly after Mexican police captured alleged drug lord Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman in May .
An assault rifle traced to X - Caliber also turned up in a cache found after eight federal policemen were killed and three others wounded in a gun battle in Culiacan , according to the ATF .
Gun shows have become particularly troublesome .
There , traffickers have their pick of weapons : AK - 47s , AR - 15s and the FN 5.57 - caliber pistol known as “ asesino de policia , ” or “ cop killer . ”

“ You see the Sinaloan cowboys come in , ” said Mangan , who browses the shows .
“ You see them with their ammunition belts and their ammunition boots .
You can see the dollies being rolled outside to their cars .
“ Why do they need the high - powered guns ?
Because the Mexican military is armed too , and they need to pierce that armor . ”
Sometimes it ’s the ammunition that tips agents off .
In November 2006 , an agent in street clothes was talking to a dealer at Kirkpatrick ’s Guns & Ammo , less than a mile from the border in Laredo , Texas .
He spotted two men repackaging more than 12,000 rounds of ammunition they had just purchased .
An investigation later led to the arrest of Carlos Alberto Osorio - Castrejon and Ramon Uresti-Careaga , both Mexican citizens in the United States illegally .

Osorio pleaded guilty to being an illegal immigrant in possession of ammunition and was given 10 months in prison .
Uresti was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to 15 months in prison .
The ammunition , the judge told Uresti and the court , “ was going to somebody in Mexico involved in some illegal activity -- drug trafficking , alien smuggling perhaps .
Or something else . ”
Just up the road from Kirkpatrick ’s , past the taquerias and the Mexican insurance offices , there is yet another gun shop .
“ Call me Rocky , ” said the man who runs Border Sporting Goods .
He advertises “ What We Do n’t Have , We Can Get . ”
He sells guns and ammunition and reloading and hunting equipment .
He personally owns more than 100 firearms .

He blamed Mexico for the gun trafficking .
“ It is not doing enough to stop it , ” he said .
“ They are a crooked country . ”
He said U.S. gun laws were too easily broken .
“ A crook could care less how many laws you have . ”
He maintained that most gun dealers were honest and vigilant and report suspicious activity .
And he called it unfair to make gun stores responsible for what their customers do : “ That ’s like holding a car manufacturer liable for traffic accidents . ”
The dealers here in Sierra Vista said they reported any customer they did not feel comfortable about .
Mike Benton runs Guns & Gear , which is easy to find on East Fry Boulevard ; a U.S. flag out front marks the spot .
He said two men claiming to be American citizens recently purchased four or five long guns .
Advertisement
“ They had the necessary documents , and an instant FBI check was approved , ” Benton said .
Still , he thought it unusual and notified authorities .
“ I never heard back , ” he said .
Shop owners heard back when they called about Adan Rodriguez .
At 335 pounds , Rodriguez was easy to remember after he started showing up at shops in Mesquite , Texas , outside Dallas .
Over a series of months , Rodriguez purchased 112 assault - class rifles , 9 - mm Beretta pistols , revolvers and high - caliber rifles , court records show .
The dealers alerted the ATF ’s Dallas office , and Tom Crowley , a special agent there , said that an undercover officer and hidden video camera were planted .

Seduced by money
Arrested , Rodriguez complained that he was making just $ 1,400 a month laying carpet and had lost his job .
He said that his mother was disabled and that he had hoped to marry soon .
Then a friend of a friend introduced him to “ Kati ” and “ Cesar , ” and they convinced him to do a little side work for some Mexican clients .
Kati and Cesar provided Rodriguez with cash amounts of up to $ 12,000 , often in thousand - dollar stacks .
Sometimes they sent an older Latino man , “ Jefe , ” ( “ Boss ” ) to deliver the money for guns .

When he bought the weapons , he took them to safe houses in Dallas .
At the time of his arrest , Rodriguez told the agents , he was being pushed to buy hand grenades and a rocket launcher too .
One of the Berettas was used in a shootout in Reynosa , Mexico , that left a cartel member dead and injured two Mexican federal agents .
In a handwritten letter to The Times from his prison cell in Seagoville , Texas , Rodriguez described how he got in deeper and deeper with the cartels .
Advertisement
“ It started out by selling one of my personal guns , and things went on [ from ] there , ” he said .
“ It was an easy way to make some money . ”
Rodriguez hesitated to write more : “ I worry about my safety and my family ’s safety . ”
The cartels , as he knows , are well - armed .

Google 's investment was strategic but may come at a financial cost Google has acknowledged that its stake in rival internet firm AOL may now be worth less than the $ 1bn ( £ 519 m ) that it paid for it two years ago .
In a statement to market regulators , Google said the value of its 5 % investment may be " impaired " , meaning its worth could have diminished .
Google took the stake largely to cement an advertising partnership with AOL .
But AOL has struggled in recent years and owner Time Warner has indicated it could sell the business .
Financial strength Time Warner recently took steps to separate the access and content functions of AOL , seen by analysts as a prelude to a sale of both operations .
Both Microsoft and Yahoo are seen as possible buyers of AOL 's content arm as they strive to compete more effectively with Google .
Google 's statement represents its first public acknowledgement that its holding in AOL may be a financial drain on its own business .
" We believe our investment in AOL may be impaired , " its statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission noted .
" There can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material . "
Google did not say how much it thought its AOL stake was now worth .
Although unfortunate , AOL 's declining value is unlikely to prove a major problem for Google given its enormous financial strength .
The firm made a $ 2.5 bn profit in the first six months of the year and currently has cash reserves of more than $ 12.5 bn .

Behold the biggest Lego airplane in the world , made after the largest passenger airplane in the world , the Airbus A380 .
Made at a 1:25 scale - 9.5 - foot long , 10.5 - foot wingspan , 3.2 - foot tall — the Lego A380 uses 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) of bricks .
That ’s a mindblowing 75,000 pieces in eight colours — 15 Lego Millennium Falcons .

With that amount of bricks , and knowing how long my Falcon is taking , I ’m not surprised that it took 600 hours for the entire team of professional Legoland model builders to assemble this beast .

The Geobulb is an 8 watt LED light that replaces a 60 watt incandescent bulb .
It generates 800 lumens of light to be exact — either warm white light or cool white .
This bulb has a sleeker design than some of the LED lights I ’ve seen — check out that aesthetically pleasing heat sink .
The Geobulb lasts 40 times longer than conventional incandescent bulbs and 10 times longer than compact fluorescent .
LED bulbs like this have the advantage of being able to be turned off and on quickly , and being able to withstand cold temperatures .
It sells for $ 60 which , for an enthusiast like myself , is a reasonable price for a ultra - efficient light that will last 10 years or more .
In fact , over the course of this bulb ’s life , it is less expensive than incandescent bulbs or fluorescents .
The GEObulb led light is available from Amazon for $ 57 .
Mr Karadzic changed his appearance during his 13 years on the run
The former Bosnian Serb leader , Radovan Karadzic , has arrived in the Netherlands to face trial before a UN war - crimes tribunal in The Hague .
Mr Karadzic , arrested in Belgrade last week after 13 years on the run , is to appear before the tribunal on Thursday .
He has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide during the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s .
It comes hours after clashes at a rally attended by at least 10,000 supporters to protest about his arrest .
More than 40 people - most of them police officers - were injured in clashes during the final speeches at the rally organised by the hardline nationalist Radical Party .
Riot police fire tear gas at protesters armed with stones and burning flares .
Failed appeal Mr Karadzic will appear in court on Thursday at 1600 ( 1400 GMT ) , when he will hear the charges against him , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) said in a statement .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

He will be allowed to enter a plea immediately or take 30 days to do so .
Speaking at a news conference , the ICTY 's chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the trial was " immensely important for the victims , who have waited too long for this day " .
Mr Karadzic 's arrest was a " major achievement " for Serbia 's co-operation with the tribunal , he said , and demonstrated that " there is no alternative to the arrest of war criminals and that there can be no safe haven for fugitives " .
However , prosecution and defence teams would need " some months " to prepare for what would be a complex trial , he added .
Mr Karadzic left a court building in Belgrade at 0345 ( 0145 GMT ) , in a convoy of cars with tinted windows .
He then took a special flight to Rotterdam airport in the Netherlands , from where he was transferred to the UN 's detention unit .
Under normal procedure , he would be read his rights , fingerprinted and photographed , and then undergo a medical examination .
The 63 - year - old had attempted to challenge the legality of his transfer .
An appeal , sent by post on Friday , had still not been received by the Serbian court on Tuesday , prompting Serbia 's justice minister to issue the final extradition order .
Mr Karadzic was arrested on 21 July in Belgrade .
He had changed his appearance , having grown a long beard , and was working as an alternative therapist .
EU pressure Mr Karadzic led the formation of a separate Bosnian Serb assembly in 1991 - one of the sparks that ignited the 1992-1995 Bosnian war .
THE CHARGES
Eleven counts of genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity and other atrocities Charged over shelling Sarajevo during the city 's siege , in which some 12,000 civilians died Allegedly organised the massacre of up to 8,000 Bosniak men and youths in Srebrenica Targeted Bosniak and Croat political leaders , intellectuals and professionals Unlawfully deported and transferred civilians because of national or religious identity Destroyed homes , businesses and sacred sites
He has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 mainly Muslim Bosniaks at Srebrenica in 1995 .
He has also been charged over the shelling of Sarajevo , and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in May and June 1995 .
On Tuesday , EU ambassadors meeting in Brussels decided to defer a decision on unfreezing trade benefits until Mr Karadzic was transferred to The Hague .
Diplomats from the 27 EU member states also said they would wait for a report by the UN war crimes prosecutor Serge Brammertz on whether Serbia was fully co-operating with the court - a condition necessary for talks on Serbia 's possible membership to the EU .
The EU is also demanding the arrest of Mr Karadzic 's wartime military commander General Ratko Mladic , who remains at large .

Rather , Marxism must not only be false , but also unreasonable — not something about which anyone who has basic powers of reason could disagree .
Orin Kerr seemed to suggest something like that in comments to a Concurring Opinions post :
Beling a Marxist is a lot like believing George W. Bush is the greatest President in American history .
Most people will think you ’re out of touch , because they think all the evidence is to the contrary .
On the other hand , there are pockets of true believers who insist the doubters are the ones who just do n’t get it .
As a result , whether it ’s discreditable depends on which crowd you have in mind .
Is this true ?
First , we should recognize that Marxism is a pretty big tent .
While Marx himself had many beliefs which are arguably false ( like the theory of history — although it ’s impossible to prove claims like that false [ cf .
Popper ] , I think we have good reason to believe it ’s the case ) , many Marxists hold modified versions of Marxism , ones that are not tied to such strong empirical claims .
Indeed , I think there are many normative Marxists , who take things like Marx ’s idea of alienation as normative critiques of capitalist institutions as unjust ( regardless of whether or not Marx himself could take alienation for a form of injustice — a topic of some debate ) .
On this , I strongly recommend reading Patrick O’Donnell ’s comments to the above - linked Concurring Opinions post , and also Joseph Slater ’s .
If that ’s false ( that is , if there ’s no alienation , or if alienation is n’t a form of injustice ) , it ’s not obvious .
( I personally happen to think it ’s true , though I would n’t call myself a Marxist . )
Second , even those beliefs , like the theory of history and the labor theory of value , that are more likely false are probably not any more seriously false than many religions .
If it ’s not discreditable to believe that Christ came back from the dead , or that he ’ll come back again with a bunch of angels to duke it out with the devil , it ’s surely not discreditable to believe that history is driven by changes in the mode of production and that the end result is some form of communism !
http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2008/08/top-anthrax-expert-maybe-theres-two.html
William Patrick is the leading U.S. expert on weaponizing anthrax , and has multiple patents in anthrax weaponization .
Patrick made an interesting point in a November 2001 article in USA Today :
Further complicating things , the spores contained in the first attack , on a Florida media company , have been described by investigators as a clumpy powder , which would make a poor aerosol .
Only two weeks later , the finely prepared Daschle - letter spores appeared .
Those spores were ground so fine that they apparently drifted across offices and contaminated other letters in the mail .
The same strain of anthrax was used in all the attacks , suggesting a common source .
The bioterrorists " must have had a hell of a short learning curve , " says Patrick , who headed U.S. bioweapons work until the program 's halt in 1969 .
" Or maybe there 's two groups . "
In other words , either a single killer or group of killers went from a crude anthrax preparation to an extremely advanced weaponized form of anthrax in 2 weeks , or there were two groups of killers .
The anthrax sent in the first letters was coarse , brown , " sandlike " , and clumpy .
The anthrax sent to Daschle and Leahy was white and very fine .
As the Washington Post noted , it was :
1.5 to 3 microns in size and processed to a grade of 1 trillion spores per gram -- 50 times finer than anything produced by the now - defunct U.S. bioweapons program and 10 times finer than the finest known grade of Soviet anthrax spores .
In addition , the anthrax sent to Daschle and Leahy was so advanced that no one at Fort Detrick had ever seen anything like it before , and scientists concluded that it used nanoparticles of polymerized glass to ensure dispersion .
In other words , if a single killer sent out all of the anthrax letters , he started out with a very crude , raw anthrax sample , and ended up with the most highly - advanced weaponized anthrax in the world , one which many leading experts say would have required expensive high - tech equipment , a team of people , and many months to prepare .
Indeed , why would someone send a crude anthrax sample if they were going to end up sending a highly - advanced preparation soon after ?
Why not just wait until the weaponization was complete , and then send both ?
That does n't make sense .
Two ( or more ) separate groups of killers is much more likely .
Q. I ’m wondering if there ’s some snazzy way to get sepia image conversion with PIL ?
Simple sepia toning is usually done by converting the image to grayscale , and then attaching a brownish palette to the image .
See e.g .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_palettes#Color_gradient_palettes
To do this in PIL , convert the image to mode “ L ” , and use putpalette to attach a suitable palette to the image .
Something like this might work :
There ’s a lot of features of Ruby that I like , but there are some that just drive me nuts like blocks not taking blocks and the ampersand operator .
Raganwald did a great job of explaining blocks , procs , and the ampersand in this blog post : Explanation of Ruby ’s Unary operator .
I came away with the feeling , “ Wow !
It took that much explanation just to tell how to send blocks around ? ”
If blocks were first - class citizens , Ruby would be more elegant .
Raganwald would not be writing huge blog posts on block vs. proc because it would be unneeded .
A Rube Goldberg contraption does a simple thing ( like making ramen ) in an extremely complex way .
It turns accidental complexity and irregularity into entertainment .
I feel for Blaine , I really do .
When I first looked at Ruby , quite honestly I hated it .
Not hated it in a Blubb - dacious “ It ’s not the same as my popular language ” way , but hated it in a “ The language is full of Accidental Complexity ” way .
To my eyes , Ruby as a language looked a lot like an internal IT app that is built as an aggregation of features .
There might be a wonderful , coherent design in the implementation that I can’t see , but the interface I use seems like a bunch on one - off features that do n’t play well together .
Ruby definitely is n’t turtles all the way down .
And I have never stopped being troubled by this .
I lamented the fact that Ruby is n’t written in Ruby Twice .
No , make that three times Deep breath .
But .
There ’s a part of my personality that craves purity and regularity in a system .
Purity and regularity have practical benefits , to be sure , but at the same time there are practical benefits to being messy and having special cases optimizing for things people do frequently .
This is why design is freakin’ hard .
It ’s not as easy as following a bunch of rules that produce a system with the smallest possible intellectual surface area , otherwise we ’d have stopped with Scheme and its five axiomatic special forms .
Nor is it as easy as piling more features on regardless of how well they fit or whether people will actually use them .
Otherwise Windows would have 97 % of the market and OS X 3 % .
( Oh wait . )
When it comes to design , sometimes you have to experience the result to judge it .
You can decide whether a chair is attractive by looking at it , but you really need to sit in it a while to know whether you will feel comfortable using it .
Even then , only long experience will tell you whether it is a keeper .
Many things that are nice in the showroom are mediocre in day - to - day use .
Design is all about problem solving .
What problem do you think programming languages solve as a group ?
What problem does Lisp solve ?
Smalltalk ?
Ruby ?
For whom ?
Matz has said that Ruby is an attempt to solve the problem of making programmers happy .
So maybe we are n’t happy with some of the accidental complexity .
But can we be happy overall ?
Can we find a way to program in harmony with Ruby rather than trying to Greenspun it into Lisp ?
( I speak as a man working on rewriting code for Ruby :
By far the hardest part of this is trying to provide the power of macros in a mechanism that works in harmony with the Ruby Way , rather than bolting Lisp onto Ruby ’s side . )
Programming languages also solve the deep problem of helping programmers think about the parts of a program that matter and not clutter their minds up with the parts that do n’t matter .
This is a very hard problem .
Very , very hard .
Make things too simple , have too few axioms and abstractions , and you end up with something where each element is extremely simple to understand , but any non-trivial program has too many elements with difficult - to - understand interactions and dependencies so as a whole programs are harder to understand .
Does a regular language help us understand the parts of programs that matter more than an irregular language ?
That is not an easy question to answer .
When I ’m struggling with some subtle difference between Proc.new and lambda , I want to shout YES , GODDAMIT , GIVE ME SOME CONSISTENCY .
I ’m wary of trying to decide about languages based on infrequent edge cases .
With a certain very popular language , I ’ve made up my mind that the design choices do n’t pay off , that the places where you work hard to express yourself are n’t places where the easy , obvious thing is easy to write and obvious to read .
But so far in Ruby , the things that trouble me do seem to have some inherent trade - off merit .
I can see how making blocks a special case makes certain eay , simple things easy .
So is it overall the best possible design ?
I do n’t know .
is it a good design ?
So far it seems to be a reasonable design .
At my core , I believe axiomatically that there is no one “ best ” language .
That is not an excuse for saying that every language has merit .
While I think that there can be more than one good language with different approaches and styles , I do not exclude the possibility that 90 % of the programming languages in existence are stinkers through and through .
Is Ruby better for me personally than Lisp or Smalltalk ?
I do n’t know the answer to that question either .
I decided a while back that I would give Ruby an honest try .
And while I give myself the freedom to express my misgivings about some of the choices Matz has made , I also try to keep an open mind about them .
It ’s really freakin’ ( I know , I used this word already ) hard for me to to do , but I ’m trying to find out if worse might be better .
And I do n’t mean , “ Ruby is worse than Lisp , but it ’s better for those n00bs over there . ”
That ’s not embracing change .
I mean I am trying to discover if worse might be better for me personally , and it is hard for me to open my mind to that possibility when I ’m already invested in “ better .
” At this moment in time I have extremely mixed feelings about Ruby .
I sorely miss the elegance and purity of languages like Scheme and Smalltalk .
But at the same time , I am trying to keep my mind open to some of the ways in which Ruby is a great programming language .
The actuarial says McCain has 8.4 “ healthy ” years left .
He mistakenly drew the conclusion that McCain would therefore be healthy through two terms in office , thinking that eight years from now is the end of McCain ’s term .
That ’s incorrect .
The end of the term is in 8 years 5.5 months from now .
Statistically , that means McCain wo n’t make it through two terms as a “ healthy ” president .
By healthy , he means “ the person does not require the care provided by an assisted living facility and is free of Alzheimer ’s disease . ”
By my back - of - the - envelope calculations , that means McCain would n’t even be able to complete two full terms in office .
His time runs out on December 30th or so of 2016 , a good three weeks before the new president would be sworn in .
So that means , statistically speaking , before the end of two terms , we should expect President McCain to have to be moved to a retirement home because he ’ll no longer be able to care for himself , and we should expect that he ’ll already be suffering from Alzheimer’s .
This is n’t a joke , and it is n’t an attempt to mock McCain or elderly people .
There ’s a reason that 72 year old men are n’t professional football players or even commercial airline pilots ( commercial pilots are required to retire at age 60 ) .
And there ’s a reason that there ’s no great uproar over the fact that senior citizens do n’t work in those professions .
It ’s the height of political correctness to suggest that the presidency of the United States during war time requires less skill , stamina , and mental acuity than flying the friendly skies .
I ’ve gotten feedback from some readers asking if McCain has had a “ cognitive impairment ” test .
I ’m told that everyone should get them as they get older , and that it ’s not clear from the medical records released ( you ’ll recall that McCain only let a select group of reporters review his medical records in a sealed room for a few hours ) .
I hope some reporters out there have the gumption to ask the McCain campaign for a specific answer to the question – has he recently taken a cognitive impairment test and what were the results ?
This is Really Quite Amazing

An illustration demonstrating Nissan 's All - Around Collision Free prototype safety technology , incorporating two all - new technologies – Side Collision Prevention ( SCP ) and Back - up Collision Prevention ( BCP ) in an image released August 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Nissan / Handout
YOKOSUKA , Japan ( Reuters ) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.
T previewed on Wednesday new safety technology that goes beyond a warning beep if drivers veer into the path of danger , and actively tries to pull the car in the direction of safety .
A car installed with the brake - resistance device would try to deter the driver from changing lanes , for example , if it detected a car zooming up from behind in the motorist ’s blind spot , Nissan said .
Motorists can still override the deterrence in an emergency but a test drive in a car fitted with the feature on Wednesday prompted the brakes to vibrate when danger was detected -- leaving little doubt about what the car thought was safe .
“ Ultimately , we want the driver to have the final control , ” an engineer said at an annual safety product demonstration at its Oppama facility in Yokosuka , near Tokyo .
Nissan has set a goal of halving fatalities and serious injuries involving its vehicles by 2015 , compared with 20 years earlier , and ultimately preventing them all together .
Some Nissan cars already have a safety feature that helps distracted drivers stay inside a lane or keep a safe distance from the car in front with visual and audible warnings as part of what the company describes as a “ virtual bumper ” concept .
Nissan said it wanted to expand that concept to preventing side and rear collisions , along with the new brake - resistance device that could be introduced in some luxury models soon .
The car company , Japan ’s third - biggest , is also working on a system to protect pedestrians , using anonymous global positioning system ( GPS ) signals from mobile phones to alert motorists to their presence .
I ’ve been a Matlab user for 15 years , and over that time period I ’ve of course become fairly dependent on it to get things done quickly .
The downside ?
It ’s expensive .
It ’s a pretty penny to buy the base package , toolboxes are extra , and there are recurrent “ maintenance ” costs each year to get upgrades .
Sure , that ’s standard practice , but each year I have to stand up and justify to my boss why we need to pay these costs for our multiple Matlab users in our shop ( a multi- user concurrent license is out of the question , do n’t even ask ) .
So what ’s a user to do ?
For years we ’ve just bit the bullet and paid the fee , but with options such as R and Numpy / SciPy out there it may be time to loosen the chain a bit .
Or maybe not .
A couple of possible alternatives to Matlab and their respective pros and cons :
R
R is a really nice statistical environment which has pretty much become the industry standard , replacing the very expensive S - Plus .
It ’s easy to install , has an excellent GUI on OS X , and has a ton of community released packages which are usually made during the preparation of scientific papers .
There are some downsides , as there can be multiple ( sometimes possibly conflicting ) packages ( e.g. gam vs mgcv ) but choice is good , right ?
The cons for me are that it ’s a new language to learn , and even though I write an m-script for everything , I find the scripting in R a bit clunky , even writing in TextWrangler and then hitting CTRL -R to have the SendToR script source the code for me .
It ’s just something new , and while the built in functions are really nice , the learning curve for coding things is higher , and will it be faster in the long run than just using Matlab ?
Numpy / SciPy
The Numpy / SciPy combo in Python is a viable alternative to Matlab , even having a page dedicated to showing you how easy it is to transition from Matlab .
As with R , it ’s free , and there are a ton of functions available , but there is a downside for me .
I ’ve successfully installed it on CentOS 5.1 and OS X 10.5 , but it was a bit complicated .
I know that these are packaged in many distributions , but not in CentOS , and I had to install from either source or .egg files , which is n’t all that tough , but took some time .
I ’m not writing the 24.3 steps I did to get it installed because honestly , I did n’t write it down and I do n’t remember what I did .
Next time I promise to list it out !
On OS X I did it all through MacPorts on the MP version of python 2.5 .
Again , it took some massaging to get it all set up since I was using the non -default install of python .
Overall though , the reason for this little diatribe is that while there are alternatives to Matlab , they all involve learning new ways to do things which , after I successfully learn them , may not be faster than just doing it in Matlab .
Most of the time I just need to get things done , and the $ 7 / day cost of Matlab may be well worth it if I ’m saving more than 10 minutes of time during that day ( assuming for a minute that I am earning $ 42/ hour ) .
I ’m rambling a bit here , but these are just questions that I ask myself as I code things up at the desk .
For each of these tools has their place , and in terms of maximum comfort and speed , I use each of them for their strengths .
The main dilemma is that in a perfect situation I would drop the commercial Matlab for the free / open source alternatives , but at a minimal cost in dollars and time .

War is hard .
It is hard on the economies of the countries involved ; it is hard on the leaders of governments ; it is hard on the families of those left behind for deployment ; it is especially hard on the soldiers .
It is no secret that , for generations of wars and military conflicts , soldiers have experienced stress and trauma that leaves a permanent mark on their health and well - being .
For some soldiers , this may be a scar , a battle wound , or the loss of a limb .
But for some soldiers , the damage is less apparent , manifested in mental health disorders , including posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , depression , and alcohol misuse .
Recent findings indicate that the Veterans Administration ( VA ) and military personnel are getting better at screening soldiers for mental health needs .
Soldiers are also getting better at asking for help .
The American Journal of Public Health recently reported that the stigma surrounding mental illness and mental health treatment is slowly disappearing .
At one VA clinic , nearly 70 % of soldiers returning from Iraq or Afghanistan who were screened for mental health services tested positive for requiring mental health services .
Of the soldiers who screened positive , more than 70 % completed mental health treatment .
The mental health needs of today ’s soldiers are different than those of past conflicts .
When a group of researchers compared the needs of soldiers deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan in the current conflict to veterans of the Vietnam War , today ’s soldiers differed significantly .
Today ’s soldiers are a younger population with many more females than the military of the past .
Additionally , today ’s soldiers are less likely to be married , and less likely to have been separated or divorced .
They are more likely to be employed , and less likely to have ever been incarcerated .
They are also less likely to have experienced exposure to wartime atrocities .
In terms of mental health needs , today ’s soldiers were less likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse disorders , but more likely to experience violent behavior .
Today ’s soldiers also receive less compensation for PTSD than veterans of the Vietnam War .
Even in soldiers with PTSD , however , today ’s soldiers retain more social functioning than Vietnam - era soldiers .
When compared to veterans of the Persian Gulf War , today ’s soldiers are markedly similar .
Still , American soldiers involved in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan do experience serious mental health issues .
A survey of Army troops last year reported that 12 % of combat troops in Iraq and 17 % in Afghanistan are taking prescription antidepressants or sleeping pills .
Soldiers are apparently paying a price for high - stress warfare , but 70 % of these soldiers will bounce back once they return home .
The remaining 30 % will likely suffer from some level of stress - related disorders , including anxiety , irritability , and trouble sleeping , or more serious consequences of panic , rage , suicidal ideation , or nervous breakdowns .
Among the list of ramifications is alcohol misuse , and a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported an increase in new - onset alcohol - related problems in soldiers of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts .
The researchers polled nearly 50,000 active and reserve duty Army and National Guard personnel .
Reserve and National Guard personnel who were deployed in the current conflicts had a statistically significant increase in new - onset heavy weekly drinking and binge drinking , compared to personnel who were not deployed .
Younger soldiers were also at increased risk for experiencing alcohol - related disorders .
Currently , officials from the U.S. Department of Defense are considering adding PTSD to the list of injuries that qualifies soldiers for a Purple Heart .
The mental health of our armed forces is clearly a critical issue if the United States is to remain a military powerhouse involved in international conflicts .

Chinese press and bloggers have been less than favourable about London 's contribution to Beijing 's Olympic closing ceremony – criticising contributions from the London Mayor Boris Johnson and David Beckham .
As the torch was put out in the " Bird 's Nest " stadium , one blogger described Mr Johnson as " arrogant , rude and disrespectful " when he accepted the Olympic flag .
There were mixed opinions too about the eight - minute cameo performance featuring a London bus , Beckham , the singer Leona Lewis , Led Zeppelin 's guitarist Jimmy Page , dancers and singers .
The Titan Sports Daily contrasted the " neatness " of the Chinese performers with the " outrageous outfits " worn by the Britons .
Unlike the Chinese custom which tends not to reveal their weakness to the outsiders , " the British seem to like to laugh about their stupidity in a funny way " , it said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" During the performance , when the London bus pulled over , all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time , which truly damaged the British image , " it added .
In the run-up to the Games , Beijing officials had run a campaign to " civilise " the city 's inhabitants , teaching them of the importance of queuing in Western culture .
It also complained that Lewis and Page were not A - list celebrities .
" Unfortunately , the singer and Jimmy Page are absolutely not famous enough to be known or recognised by millions of the Chinese audiences .
As for David Beckham , he was supposed to kick the football towards the red circle in the centre of the ' Bird 's Nest ' .
In the end , just like any of his penalties at a football match , he totally missed it .
He kicked the ball to the left and dropped in the crowd , then was picked up by a lucky Chinese volunteer who would not let go of the ball . "
The Daily First praised the use of a red London bus , but questioned whether the performance had anything to do with sport or the Olympic Games .
Mr Johnson was also criticised for accepting the Olympic flag with one hand only .
The effect of these choices in Iowa became jarringly clear when Penn conducted a poll just after Clinton ’s Senate reelection that showed her running a very distant third , barely ahead of the state ’s governor , Tom Vilsack .
The poll produced a curious revelation : Iowans rated Clinton at the top of the field on questions of leadership , strength , and experience — but most did not plan to vote for her , because they did n’t like her .
This presented a basic conundrum : Should Clinton run a positive campaign , to persuade Iowans to reconsider her ?
Or should she run a negative campaign that would accuse her opponents of being untrustworthy and under-qualified ?
Clinton ’s top advisers never agreed on the answer .
Over the course of the campaign , they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of Clinton ’s favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes .
And Clinton herself could never quite decide who was right .
March 2007 : The Strategy
Penn had won the trust of both Clintons by guiding Bill Clinton to reelection in 1996 and through the impeachment saga that followed .
But his poll - tested centrism and brusque manner aroused suspicion and contempt among many of their advisers .
In the White House and during Hillary ’s Senate races , Penn often prevailed in internal disputes by brandishing his own poll numbers ( which his opponents distrusted ) and pointing out that he had delivered a Clinton to the White House once before .
In light of this history , he got off to an inauspicious start when Clinton entered the race in January 2007 , by demanding the title “ chief strategist ” ( previously he had been one of several “ senior advisers ” ) and presenting each of his senior colleagues with a silver bowl inscribed with the words of Horace Mann : “ Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity . ”
Penn had clear ideas about how to engineer a win for Clinton , in Iowa and beyond .
Obama had eclipsed Edwards right out of the gate and was experiencing the full measure of “ next JFK ” hype .
In a memo dated March 19 , 2007 , Penn laid out an “ Overall Strategy for Winning ” built upon a coalition of voters he called “ Invisible Americans , ” a sort of reprise of Bill Clinton ’s “ forgotten middle class ” :
As this race unfolds , the winning coalition for us is clearer and clearer .
There are three demographic variables that explain almost all of the voters in the primary — gender , party , and income .
Race is a factor as well , but we are fighting hard to neutralize it .
We are the candidate of people with needs .
We win women , lower classes , and Democrats ( about 3 to 1 in our favor ) .
Obama wins men , upper class , and independents ( about 2 to 1 in his favor ) .
Edwards draws from these groups as well .
Our winning strategy builds from a base of women , builds on top of that a lower and middle class constituency , and seeks to minimize his advantages with the high class democrats .
If we double perform with WOMEN , LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS , then we have about 55 % of the voters .
The reason the Invisible Americans is so powerful is that it speaks to exactly how you can be a champion for those in needs [ sic ] .
He may be the JFK in the race , but you are the Bobby .
Clinton was already under attack for an attitude of “ inevitability ” — the charge being that she imperiously viewed the primary process as a ratifying formality and would not deign to compete for what she felt she was owed .
Penn ’s memo makes clear that what she intended to project was “ leadership ” and “ strength , ” and that he had carefully created an image for her with that in mind .
He believed that he had identified a winning coalition and knew which buttons to press to mobilize it :
1 ) Start with a base of women .
a . For these women you represent a breaking of barriers
b . The winnowing out of the most competent and qualified in an unfair , male dominated world
c. The infusion of a woman and a mother ’s sensibilities into a world of war and neglect
2 ) Add on a base of lower and middle class voters
a . You see them ; you care about them
b. You were one of them , it is your history
c. You are all about their concerns ( healthcare , education , energy , child care , college etc . )
d. Sense of patriotism , Americana
3 ) Play defensively with the men and upper class voters
a. Strength to end the war the right way
b. Connect on the problems of the global economy , economics
c. Foreign policy expert
d. Unions
Contest the black vote at every opportunity .
Keep him pinned down there .
Organize on college campuses .
We may not be number 1 there , but we have a lot of fans — more than enough to sustain an organization in every college .
Penn ’s prescription is notable because it is the rare instance of a Clinton campaign goal that panned out — the coalition she ended up winning a year later is the one described here .
Penn ’s memo is also notable for its tone : it reinforces rather than confronts the Clintons ’ biases .
“ The biggest problem we have is the troika that has been set up to tear Hillary down , ” he wrote .
It is a vast right and left wing conspiracy .
Listening to Brit Hume say that Obama is surging while Hillary failed to do X is almost comical and certainly transparent .
The right knows Obama is unelectable except perhaps against Attila the Hun , and a third party would come in then anyway .
By contrast , top consultants like Karl Rove usually aim to temper their clients ’ biases with a cold dose of realism .
I suspect the damaging persecution complex that both Clintons displayed drew much of its sustenance from memos like this one .

The Internet is a great tool for spreading information .
People who would be afraid of the social consequences of buying a book about lesbianism in their local book store or reserving a Wiccan spellbook at the library can quickly and mostly anonymously find a wealth of information about the taboo topics that they are interested in .
It is also a great tool for role play .
From people in IRC channels rolling the dice to see if they can cast Magic Missle at the darkness from people making up personas to gather the attention they feel they need , many folks don characters to fulfill some need or desire they have .
This has lead to what I feel is a kind of one - up - manship in some areas .
People trying to make the best web design , tell the most tear - jerking sob story .
And possibly , the most alternative of alternative religions .
I am not talking about your momma's alternative religion .
Wicca , Satanism , that 's all passe in the cool Internet kid 's club .
I 'm talking about Multiples ,
When most of the people posting in a group are experiencing intense depression it is clearly not caused by neglecting real life for their fantasies , but instead magical ley lines that have been corrupted .
They chat endlessly in their live journal communities and ezboards about how some stupid mundane brushed up against their phantom wings and how angry it made them .
All of these community groups have the same basic rule :
Do not question the claims of others .
What is true for one person is true for the group , and nothing must be looked at critically .
What interests me about this is not so much the beliefs themselves , which are essentially role playing taken to an extreme , but rather the evolution of these communities .
Many moons ago it was fringe enough to be a furry and create a persistant anthropomorphic character .
After a couple of years more and more people began embracing furry culture , and in reaction a small , vocal group began deciding they really were these characters .
Soon a lot of people were deciding that they really were their characters , especially if their characters were dragons , and the Otherkin were born .
The approached their otherness in different ways , some claiming to have been a dragon in the past life , some claiming that they got a dragon's soul that was meant to go to another universe , some claiming they were biologically born part dragon and that a Seeming had been put on them to make them appear human .
But some people could n't pick just one character to be , or one animal they identified with .
So both multiples and hybrids were born .
Some people decided that they had several different souls in them that were each clear and distinct seperate people from themselves , and that these people could take control at times .
Others decided to just mash their totemic animals together and you got leopardwolves , feline horses , and the ever present and incredibly popular wolfdragons .
In recent years , in a move demonstrating incredible creative laziness , and with the introduction of more and more preteens to these communities , came the Soulbonders and Otakukins .
Soulbonders are somewhat like Multiples .
They believe fictional characters , especially animated ones , live in their heads or souls , and talk to them , worry about them , and occasionally take control of them .
It 's Imaginary Friends with spirituality smacked on in an attempt to make it less laughable .
Otakukin are people who believe they were fictional characters in a past life in an alternate universe .
I really was Penny from Inspector Gadget and I have the memories to prove it .
As part of the escalation of weirdness , any of these subcultures can and frequently are mingled , with dragons soulbonding dragons from video games and multiples counting anime characters among their personalities .
And the rule of not questioning the claims of each other persists .
So what this post about is less these subcultures and more about this .
Would these communities thrive without the Internet ?
How likely is it that Jane the 27 year old writer would have decided that her hardboiled detective was real and living in her , only he was half dragon and lusting after Sephiroth from FF7 if she had n't been a part of a furry community 10 years ago and witnessed the escalation of claims ?
Would Bob the angry teenager feel the need to claim that he only broke things when Raphael the Ninja Turtle was " fronting " if just playing a really hot cheeta was still enough to get him the online attention he craves ?
How much of this insanity is caused by the Internet 's ability to quickly transfer information creating a situation where the attention seeking change fads swiftly and how much would exist in a world where the Internet did not exist ?

A usual scanning of a human brain presents a muted gray image , which one can distinguish quite easy by a series of complex folds .
However , a neuroscientist working at Massachusetts General Hospital , in Boston , Van Wedeen , claims that such image is only a shadow of the actual brain .
Recently scientists revealed the real structure of our brain , featuring accurately ordered tangle of nerve cells and the elongated projections linking the cells .
It is worth mentioning that the image was kept secret until now .
Custom MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) is able to identify the main anatomical aspects of the brain .
The procedure is mostly used to recognize stokes and brain tumors .
However , the continuous development in the field of computing and processing algorithms made it possible for scientists to study the data obtained from MRI in totally new perspective .
One of the new ways to observe the brain in a new perspective is called diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) .
The DSI applies magnetic resonance signals to identify the motion of water molecules in the brain .
The water spreads along the length of axons , neural wires .
With the help of such diffusion estimations scientists are able to observe the wires , building a meticulous image of the brain 's connectivity .
In the field of medicine , specialists are starting to use the new technology in order to observe the brain before such surgeries as tumor removal .
They map the brain to avoid vital fiber tracts .
Together with other researchers , Wedeen used the diffusion imaging for a clearer understanding of the structures that lie beneath human 's ability to see , speak and remember .
Besides , researches look forward to use the new techniques to better understand such diseases as schizophrenia and autism , which show abnormal wiring .
This video shows the image of a scanned dissected brain of a marmoset .
After completing the 24 - hour scan , scientists managed to produce a map that has a spatial resolution of 400 microns .
" The image quality and resolution are much higher than we can obtain in a living subject , " says Wedeen .
The video shows a rotating brain where you can observe all the neural fibers in half of the brain : the spiky fibers resembling pins in a pincushion represent a part of the cerebral cortex .
This brain of a marmoset does not include the folding which is typical for the human brain .
" The human brain would look 25 times as complicated .
Every gyrus [ fold ] has its own story to tell , " mentioned Wedeen .

For now , wind power 's triumphant march in the U.S. can count on another legal smackdown of " NIMBYism , " after a Texas appeals court yesterday dismissed a suit by landowners upset ...
I ’m an East Coast kid , and probably always will be .
I grew up in Massachusetts and Maryland , within driving distance of the Atlantic , and ca n’t imagine living on the opposite shore at any point in my lifetime .
However , if there ’s a city that could possibly lure me west , it would be San Francisco .
Since I was young , I ’ve always had a highly idealized vision of the Bay Area .
When I was about 10 years old , I traveled there with my mother , and I remember coming off the highway and seeing silver fog pouring over the mountains and hills of South San Francisco like water .
I was amazed by my father ’s stories of when he lived in the Mission District and Pacific Heights , and the way he described it made it seem like a fantasy world , unlike any place I had ever seen or heard of .
I listened to and loved the music that came out of the area in the late 60s , and I read about “ The Summer of Love , ” the Golden Gate Park concerts , and the acid tests .
I wanted to be there .
For me , San Francisco was this perfect place wrapped in fog and surrounded by mountains and blue - green bays , enclosing it from the rest of the world .
It was n’t until this month that my wonderland image of the city gained an element of reality .
I made the long trip across the country with my mother to visit a few friends and family , and for a while , I was still in my dream world .
We stood at the summit of the Twin Peaks , staring out at the skyline nestled in fog and flanked by those sepia brown hills and that shimmering bay .
We sat on the edge of the Pacifica cliffs over the ocean .
We had breakfast at Pier 39 and watched the sea lions play king of the hill on the docks that they had invaded .
After a day of being a tourist and loving every minute of it , we got in our car and took that trip we had made years ago , across highway 101 to South San Francisco .
My childhood memory of those hills was crystal clear in my mind .
We got on the highway , turned off on the exit and came around the bend , and there it was .
A big , round Target symbol , rising up above the store smack dab in the middle of the landscape .
It was like a giant red stamp that said , “ This is n’t wonderland .
This is a city . ”
The next day , we drove through the Tenderloin , one of San Francisco ’s most run-down , high - crime neighborhoods .
Looking out the car window at vacant , boarded - up buildings , damaged cars , and weather - wearied homeless people , I had visions of my home city of Baltimore .
I was starting to wake from my dream .
I saw gas prices at almost five dollars a gallon , and parking garages almost double the price of any garage in Maryland .
Just about everything seemed to be a lot more expensive than anywhere else .
After living in a city for two years , these things became much more significant to me than they ever were before .
Later in the afternoon , we drove to Haight - Ashbury , and I hoped there would still be hippies in the Haight .
To my surprise and delight , I was n’t let down .
We saw the expected gift shops and commercialization capitalizing off Hendrix and the Doors , but as we parked on the corner , in the place I had only seen in photographs , there were three young kids , singing and playing guitar on the sidewalk with a sign that said , “ Need money for LSD . ”
The neighborhood was a nuthouse , the sidewalks teeming with long hair , tie - dye tee shirts , and everything else that would make “ the man ” mutter in disdain .
It was n’t the same as 1967 , but it was close enough .
As we drove out down Haight St. , we looked out the car window to see a lady balancing on a board atop a wooden barrel , dressed in full Viking armor , a spiked helmet and a ballerina tutu , singing and playing the accordion .
She ’s my new San Francisco memory .
On our last day in the city , we had breakfast at a somewhat run-down little yacht club on the bay , watching a Cajun zydeco band jam on accordion and spoons for hours as some of the strangest people I ’ve ever seen tore it up on the dance floor .
As I sat observing a Snoop Dogg look - a- like two - step with an elderly woman , I started to get that same feeling whenever I thought about the San Francisco hills as a kid .
It may not be the wonderland I once dreamed of , but it still has enough of that old spirit to keep you surprised at every street corner
Updated A federal grand jury has indicted longtime Senator Ted Stevens , Republican of Alaska , on charges of failing to disclose receiving gifts of services and construction work as part of a wide - ranging corruption inquiry involving public officials and corporations in his home state .
The indictment accuses Mr. Stevens of failing to report on his financial disclosure forms receiving gifts of more than $ 250,000 — in labor and construction materials — from Veco Corp .
Matthew Friedrich , assistant attorney general , said that at the same time that construction and architectural work was being done by Veco Corp. executives and employees on Mr. Stevens ’ home in Girdwood , the corporation was seeking assistance on business - related matters .
Among the services performed at the senator ’s Girdwood home , called the “ chalet ” by the family , was the lifting of the building onto stilts with an entirely new first floor built , as well as such amenities as a Viking grill .
Despite the fact that Veco executives had longstanding ties with Mr. Stevens and lobbied him on federal matters , Mr. Friedrich cautioned that the indictment did not allege any quid pro quo .
Mr. Stevens , however , did not reimburse the corporation for any of the work done at his home , he added .
Senator Stevens issued a statement in which he proclaimed his innocence , and said :
“ I have proudly served this nation and Alaska for over 50 years .
My public service began when I served in World War II .
It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me .
I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S. Senator .
In accordance with Senate Republican Conference rules , I have temporarily relinquished my vice - chairmanship and ranking positions until I am absolved of these charges .
The impact of these charges on my family disturbs me greatly .
I am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that . ”
Just a year ago , federal agents raided Mr. Stevens ’ home following questions about renovations at the home .
A few months before that , an Alaska businessman , Bill J. Allen , admitted to bribery , and in court papers acknowledged making $ 243,000 in possibly illegal payments to a state lawmaker identified only as “ Senator B . ”
That abbreviation referred to Senator Ted Stevens ’s son , Ben Stevens .
The sprawling federal investigation that began more than four years ago has ensnared several local and state officials , as well as federal officials .
The Anchorage Daily News has a breakdown of those who have been charged and / or convicted .
The 84 - year - old senator has been running for re-election this year while he was under investigative scrutiny , a matter that had not gone unmentioned by Democrats .
His opponent , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , has been campaigning hard against the longest - sitting Republican member of the Senate , and Democrats have been touting this race as among its most competitive this year .
Mr. Stevens was first appointed to the Senate in 1968 , and has served nearly six full terms .
He also had been a United States attorney in the 1950s .
Federal officials said they did not know whether Mr. Stevens would surrender to authorities here or in Alaska for an arraignment .
Here ’s a link to the full indictment .

Depending ON whom you ask , marijuana is a dangerous drug that should be kept illegal alongside heroin and PCP , or it ’s a miracle herb with a trove of medical benefits that the government is seeking to deny the public -- or something in between : a plant with medical uses and drawbacks , worth exploring .
As the political debates over medical marijuana drag on , a small cadre of researchers continues to test inhaled marijuana for the treatment of pain , nausea and muscle spasms .
All drugs have risks , they point out -- including ones in most Americans ’ medicine cabinets , such as aspirin and other pain - relievers or antihistamines such as Benadryl .
Doctors try to balance those risks against the potential for medical good -- why not for marijuana as well , they ask .
The truth , these researchers say , is that marijuana has medical benefits -- for chronic - pain syndromes , cancer pain , multiple sclerosis , AIDS wasting syndrome and the nausea that accompanies chemotherapy -- and attempts to understand and harness these are being hampered .
Also , they add , science reveals that the risks of marijuana use , which have been thoroughly researched , are real but generally small .

Dr. Donald Abrams , chief of hematology and oncology at San Francisco General Hospital and professor of clinical medicine at UC San Francisco , says he sees cancer patients in pain , not eating or sleeping well , experiencing nausea and vomiting from treatment , and being depressed about their situation .
He says he is glad that he lives in California , where use of medical marijuana is allowed by state law , although federal officials continue to raid cannabis dispensaries in the state and scrutinize practices of physicians who specialize in writing cannabis recommendations for patients .
“ I can talk to patients about medicinal cannabis [ and ]
I ’m often recommending it to them for these indications , ” Abrams says .

These charts were built in 2004 by Eric Armstrong with voicing by Paul Meier , and require Flash to work .
Now in 2020 , most browsers are deprecating Flash , so they will soon stop working for most people .
Back when the iPhone was first created ( in 2007 ) , Steve Jobs said that the iPhone would n’t support Flash .
Now everyone is following suit .
At present it is still possible to make them work , but who knows how long that will continue .
I was able to get them working in Chrome using these instructions .
I have no plans to change the charts over to a different technology .
It would take a lot of work , as I would have to remake them from scratch .
I feel that there are other sites with adequate versions available to use instead .
One is ipachart.com —
I do n’t like it as well , but it does work on all devices , and has a very memorable URL !
Another very interesting alternative is " World Sounds " at UBC .
that shows video of the tongue in action , based on ultrasound superimposed on a video of the speaker .
It ’s as if you could see through their head and into their mouth !
Similarly , Seeing Speech ’s charts , available at https://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk/ipa-charts/?chart=4, are very helpful , along with the mega-vowel comparison in the companion site Dynamic Dialects , do a great job of visualizing the tongue action with the help of Ultrasound and MRI imaging .
The one I like best with similar functionality is from the actual International Phonetic Association , https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/inter_chart_2018/IPA_2018.html
It has the added bonus of being both a symbol - sound chart ( with 4 different voices , so you can hear 4 different , well - known phoneticians — including a woman — speak the sounds , AND you can use the chart to transcribe symbols in the top field on the page , which you can then copy and paste into a document .
Note that the chart lives on in another form via Paul Meier ’s IPA app for the iPhone , available here : https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/interactive-ipa/id873308318
.
The Android version is available here : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paulmeier.InteractiveIPA
IF THE PAGE IS STILL WORKING :
These charts will link you to a Flash animation of the sounds and names of the IPA symbols .
The consonant chart , because it has so many sounds / symbols is large ( 1.8 MB ) , while the vowel chart is quite small and will load quickly .
The complete IPA is now available .
Also , we have made available a chart which features all the vowel sounds of English , including all the diphthongs .
The latest version of the IPA Alphabet was published in 1993 ( updated in 1996 ) by the International Phonetic Association .

This year , some of the most arresting images in the race for the White House are not the work of ad agencies , political consultants or photojournalists but of a subculture of artists who use the streets as their canvas .
Their pro-Obama work -- there is no similar phenomenon for John McCain -- has been spotted everywhere , even Paris and Beijing .

It ’s an odd twist in the world of street art , an arena where creative renegades question power and convention with their homemade posters and hand - painted murals -- and do n’t usually endorse major party politicians .
“ It ’s not cool with the sort of rebellious , punk , street - artist types to support something that is seen as a part of the system , ” said Shepard Fairey , the Los Angeles - based street artist responsible for the “ Hope ” posters and stickers .
Coming together
Yet when it comes to Obama , street artists around the country are falling into line .
“ Obama ’s a rock star , he ’s got a great brand and he ’s a very sexy candidate , ” explained Ian Bourland , a University of Chicago graduate student who is one of the few academics studying recent street art .
“ It ’s his race , his politics and his charisma . ”

Street artists embrace the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee ’s experience as a community organizer , in part because they view their own movement as similarly grass - roots .
“ He ’s perceived as sharing their ethos , ” Bourland said .
Fairey and Chicago artist Ray Noland plan to be in Denver next week for the Democratic National Convention .
Noland will be hawking his paintings and posters and Fairey will be there as a judge in the Manifest Hope Gallery Contest , a national art competition he is sponsoring with MoveOn.org .
Artists from around the country were asked to submit work about Obama or centered around the themes of hope , progress , change , patriotism or unity .
The best works will be displayed at the Manifest Hope Gallery , which will be set up in downtown Denver .
Controversial approach
Street art -- regarded as creative , non -gang graffiti by its admirers and as vandalism by its detractors -- evolved in part out of the do - it - yourself punk movement of the 1980s .

Current targets of its rebellious edge include the Iraq war and gentrification , along with old enemies such as capitalism .
“ It ’s pretty unusual to find things that street artists and graffiti artists are in support of , ” said Joe Austin , a University of Wisconsin history professor who studies youth movements .
Still , street artists such as San Francisco ’s Eddie ( he asked that his last name not be used for fear of legal retribution ) are enthusiastic about Obama , and they say they are expressing their sentiments in the vocabulary they know best .
“ I could go and volunteer at the campaign and make calls , but that ’s probably not the best use of my skill set , ” said Eddie , who has plastered the Bay Area with red-and - black posters that feature a close - up of the candidate ’s face .
“ Street art is what I do . ”
Noland , 35 , also a freelance graphic designer , makes Obama posters filled with basketball imagery to appeal to urban youth .
In one , a smiling Obama clutches a red , white and blue basketball and stands beside the slogan “ Obama got next ” -- a play off the lingo basketball players use to claim a court .

Noland became interested in Obama while reading his 1995 autobiography , “ Dreams From My Father . ”
“ I thought , ‘ This guy has got it all .
He ’s got the pedigree .
He ’s gone to Harvard , but he ’s also connected to the community , to the neighborhood , ’ ” Noland said .
“ He also plays ball ! ”
His art is , Noland said , “ a conscious effort to position Obama in a certain way , to position him as cool and to position him as hip . ”
Noland first sold his posters to friends .
Then , just before the Illinois Democratic primary , he rented a storefront and made it a temporary art gallery , where he marketed his screen - printed Obama posters and paintings .
He eventually packed the pictures into his Subaru and took his work on the road .
Noland set up shop in Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Oregon for those states ’ primaries .
In North Carolina , Noland was surprised by a visit from Obama and his wife , Michelle , who “ spent all of this time just gazing at the images , ” Noland said .
“ I think he was overwhelmed at seeing all of this work with his face all around . ”
But , Noland said , Obama told him to keep up the good work .

Not in lock step
The pro-Obama street art movement has its detractors .
Other artists have defaced the Obama work , and one blogger attacked Noland for depicting Obama “ as a Messiah figure . ”
Noland said he understands the critique -- in one of his early images , Obama seems to be emanating gold rays of light -- and he has toned down his recent work .
Other critics have dismissed Fairey ’s Obama “ Hope ” image , an idealized portrait of Obama gazing toward the sky , as no more than propaganda .
Fairey , 38 , admits that his design was inspired in part by Soviet propaganda posters , but he insists that it is meant to provoke , not indoctrinate .

Before the Obama poster , Fairey was known internationally for his anti-authoritarian “ Obey Giant ” sticker campaign , which he launched in the late 1980s while studying at the Rhode Island School of Design .
For the project , Fairey and his friends distributed stickers and posters featuring Andre the Giant , a French wrestler , many of which were stamped with the word “ Obey . ”
Since then , Fairey , who moved to L.A. in 2002 , has launched projects including a clothing company , a magazine and a commercial design business .
He runs the art gallery Subliminal Projects in Echo Park , DJs at dance parties and has been featured in numerous documentary films .
But he says street art is his first love .
When he talks about it , he adopts the sober vocabulary of an art historian and runs his paint - stained fingers through his graying blond hair .
Fairey got on board with Obama in 2004 , when he watched the senator ’s televised speech at the Democratic National Convention .
“ I was so impressed , ” he recalled .
“ I thought to myself , ‘ This is someone to watch . ’ ”
He liked Obama ’s emphasis on the environment and his commitment to curbing lobbyists ’ power .
So in January of this year , just as the primary season was heating up , he drew up the design for the “ Hope ” poster .
He has distributed more than 80,000 of them and made a downloadable version available free on his website .

Fairey , who has been arrested multiple times for trespassing and vandalism while putting up his guerrilla art , was worried that Obama ’s campaign might not want to be associated with street art .
“ When you look at how the general public looks at [ street art ] , they ’re scared of it , ” he says .
“ They associate it with gang bangers and anarchists . ”
Yet in February , Fairey received a letter signed by Obama that thanked the artist for his support and declared , “ The political messages involved in your work have encouraged Americans to believe they can help change the status quo .
Your images have a profound effect on people , whether seen in a gallery or on a stop sign . ”
( An Obama spokesman added that the campaign hopes artists respect the law and their communities when putting up their art . )

Fairey also was asked to donate an official “ Hope ” campaign poster , which is being sold on Obama ’s website .
And with that , the renegade went mainstream .

" Let me see if I understand your thesis .
You think we should n't anthropomorphize people ? "
-- Sidney Morgenbesser to B. F. Skinner
Behaviorism was the doctrine that it was unscientific for a psychologist to ascribe emotions , beliefs , thoughts , to a human being .
After all , you can't directly observe anger or an intention to hit someone .
You can only observe the punch .
You may hear someone say " I 'm angry ! " but that 's hearing a verbal behavior , not seeing anger .
Thoughts are not observable , therefore they are unscientific , therefore they do not exist .
Oh , you think you 're thinking , but that 's just a delusion - or it would be , if there were such things as delusions .
This was before the day of computation , before the concept of information processing , before the " cognitive revolution " that led to the modern era .
If you looked around for an alternative to behaviorism , you did n't find , " We 're going to figure out how the mind processes information by scanning the brain , reading neurons , and performing experiments that test our hypotheses about specific algorithms . "
You found Freudian psychoanalysis .
This may make behaviorism a bit more sympathetic .
Part of the origin of behaviorism , was in a backlash against substance dualism - the idea that mind is a separate substance from ordinary physical phenomena .
Today we would say , " The apparent specialness comes from the brain doing information - processing ; a physical deed to be sure , but one of a different style from smashing a brick with a sledgehammer . "
The behaviorists said , " There is no mind . " ( John B. Watson , founder of behaviorism , in 1928 . )
The behaviorists outlawed not just dualistic mind - substance , but any such things as emotions and beliefs and intentions ( unless defined in terms of outward behavior ) .
After all , science had previously done away with angels , and de-gnomed the haunted mine .
Clearly the method of reason , then , was to say that things did n't exist .
Having thus fathomed the secret of science , the behaviorists proceeded to apply it to the mind .
You might be tempted to say , " What fools !
Obviously , the mind , like the rainbow , does exist ; it is to be explained , not explained away .
Saying ' the subject is angry ' helps me predict the subject ; the belief pays its rent .
The hypothesis of anger is no different from any other scientific hypothesis . "
That 's mostly right , but not that final sentence .
" The subject is angry , even though I can't read his mind " is not quite the same sort of hypothesis as " this hydrogen atom contains an electron , even though I can't see it with my naked eyes " .
Let 's say that I have a confederate punch the research subject in the nose .
The research subject punches the confederate back .
The behaviorist says , " Clearly , the subject has been previously conditioned to punch whoever punches him . "
But now let 's say that the subject 's hands are tied behind his back , so that he can't return the punch .
On the hypothesis that the subject becomes angry , and wants to hurt the other person , we might predict that the subject will take any of many possible avenues to revenge - a kick , a trip , a bite , a phone call two months later that leads the confederate 's wife and girlfriend to the same hotel ...
All of these I can predict by saying , " The subject is angry , and wants revenge . "
Even if I offer the subject a new sort of revenge that the subject has never seen before .
You can't account for that by Pavlovian reflex conditioning , without hypothesizing internal states of mind .
And yet - what is " anger " ?
How do you know what is the " angry " reaction ?
How do you know what tends to cause " anger " ?
You 're getting good predictions of the subject , but how ?
By empathic inference : by configuring your own brain in a similar state to the brain that you want to predict ( in a controlled sort of way that does n't lead you to actually hit anyone ) .
This may yield good predictions , but that 's not the same as understanding .
You can predict angry people by using your own brain in empathy mode .
But could you write an angry computer program ?
You do n't know how your brain is making the successful predictions .
You can't print out a diagram of the neural circuitry involved .
You can't formalize the hypothesis ; you can't make a well - understood physical system that predicts without human intervention ; you can't derive the exact predictions of the model ; you can't say what you know .
In modern cognitive psychology , there are standard ways of handling this kind of problem in a " scientific " way .
One panel of reviewers rates how much a given stimulus is likely to make a subject " angry " , and a second independent panel of reviewers rate how much a given response is " angry " ; neither being told the purpose of the experiment .
This is designed to prevent self - favoring judgments of whether the experimental hypothesis has been confirmed .
But it does n't get you closer to opening the opaque box of anger .
Can you really call a hypothesis like that a model ?
Is it really scientific ?
Is it even Bayesian - can you talk about it in terms of probability theory ?
The less radical behaviorists did not say that the mind unexisted , only that no scientist should ever talk about the mind .
Suppose we now allow all algorithmic hypotheses about the mind , where the hypothesis is framed in terms that can be calculated on a modern computer , so that experimental predictions can be formally made and observationally confirmed .
This gets you a large swathe of modern cognitive science , but not the whole thing .
Is the rest witchcraft ?
I would say " no " .
In terms of probability theory , I would see " the subject is angry " as a hypothesis relating the output of two black boxes , one of which happens to be located inside your own brain .
You 're supposing that the subject , whatever they do next , will do something similar to this ' anger ' black box .
This ' anger ' box happens to be located inside you , but is nonetheless opaque , and yet still seems to have a strong , observable correspondence to the other ' anger ' box .
If two black boxes often have the same output , this is an observable thing ; it can be described by probability theory .
From the perspective of scientific procedure , there are many ' anger ' boxes scattered around , so we use other ' anger ' boxes instead of the experimenter's .
And since all the black boxes are noisy and have poorly controlled environments , we use multiple ' anger ' boxes in calculating our theoretical predictions , and more ' anger ' boxes to gather our experimental results .
That may not be as precise as a voltmeter , but it 's good enough to do repeatable experimental science .
( Over on the Artificial Intelligence side of things , though , any concept you can't compute is magic .
At best , it 's a placeholder for your speculations , a space where you 'll put a real theory later .
Marcello and I adopted the rule of explicitly saying ' magical ' to describe any cognitive operation that we did n't know exactly how to compute . )
Oh , and by the way , I suspect someone will say : " But you can account for complex revenges using behaviorism : you just say the subject is conditioned to take revenge when punched ! "
Unless you can calculate complex revenges with a computer program , you are using your own mind to determine what constitutes a " complex revenge " or not .
Using the word " conditioned " just disguises the empathic black box - the empathic black box was contained in the concept of revenge , that you can recognize , but which you could not write a program to recognize .
So empathic cognitive hypotheses , as opposed to algorithmic cognitive hypotheses , are indeed special .
They require special handling in experimental procedure ; they cannot qualify as final theories .
But for the behaviorists to react to the sins of Freudian psychoanalysis and substance dualism , by saying that the subject matter of empathic inference did not exist ...
...okay , I 'm sorry , but I think that even without benefit of hindsight , that 's a bit silly .
Case in point of reversed stupidity is not intelligence .
Behaviorism stands beside Objectivism as one of the great historical lessons against rationalism .
Now , you do want to be careful when accusing people of " rationalism " .
It seems that most of the times I hear someone accused of " rationalism " , it is typically a creationist accusing someone of " rationalism " for denying the existence of God , or a psychic believer accusing someone of " rationalism " for denying the special powers of the mind , etcetera .
But reversed stupidity is not intelligence : even if most people who launch accusations of " rationalism " are creationists and the like , this does not mean that no such error as rationalism exists .
There really is a fair amount of historical insanity of various folks who thought of themselves as " rationalists " , but who mistook some correlate of rationality for its substance .
And there is a very general problem where rationalists occasionally do a thing , and people assume that this act is the very substance of the Way and you ought to do it as often as possible .
It is not the substance of the Way to reject entities about which others have said stupid things .
Though sometimes , yes , people say stupid things about a thing which does not exist , and a rationalist will say " It does not exist " .
It is not the Way to assert the nonexistence of that which is difficult to measure .
Though sometimes , yes , that which is difficult to observe , is not there , and a rationalist will say " It is not there " .
But you also have to make equally accurate predictions without the discarded concept .
That part is key .
The part where you cry furiously against ancient and outmoded superstitions , the part where you mock your opponents for believing in magic , is not key .
Not unless you also take care of that accurate predictions thing .
Crying " Superstition ! " does play to the audience stereotype of rationality , though .
And indeed real rationalists have been known to thus inveigle - often , indeed - but against gnomes , not rainbows .
Knowing the difference is the difficult part !
You are not automatically more hardheaded as a rationalist , the more things whose existence you deny .
If it is good to deny phlogiston , it is not twice as good to also deny anger .
Added : I found it difficult to track down primary source material online , but behaviorism - as - denial - of - mental does not seem to be a straw depiction .
I was able to track down at least one major behaviorist ( J.B. Watson , founder of behaviorism ) saying outright " There is no mind . "
See my comment below .
SEATTLE -
For the first time , researchers have demonstrated that the administration of minute amounts of inhaled or intravenous hydrogen sulfide , or H2S - the molecule that gives rotten eggs their sulfurous stench - significantly improves survival from extreme blood loss in rats .
Cell biologist Mark B. Roth , Ph.D. , and colleagues in the Basic Sciences Division of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , in collaboration with surgeon Robert K. Winn , Ph.D. , and colleagues at UW Medicine 's Harborview Medical Center , report their findings online ahead of print in The Journal of Trauma Injury , Infection , and Critical Care .
The article is slated for the July print issue , which comes out on July 10 .
The researchers successfully used H2S to induce a state of reversible metabolic hibernation as a way to reduce death from insufficient blood supply to organs and tissues in a rat model of lethal hemorrhage .
( Federal regulations mandate the use of such animal models in preclinical research to test the safety and effectiveness of various procedures and treatments before they can be tested in humans . )
They found that 75 percent of rats ( 18 of 24 ) given inhaled hydrogen sulfide and 67 percent of rats ( eight of 12 ) given intravenous hydrogen sulfide survived at least two weeks - the duration of the monitoring period - after losing more than half of their blood for an extended period .
In contrast , long - term survival rates for the untreated rats in the two control groups were 23 percent ( three of 13 ) and 14 percent ( one of seven ) , respectively .
" Our goal is to develop life - saving treatment for critically ill people suffering from acute , sustained blood loss , such as in a car accident or on the battlefield , " said senior author Roth .
" These findings have obvious implications for the military , but they also have tremendous implications for the civilian population . "
The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Defense Services Office funded the research .
The ultimate goal : designing self - injectable hydrogen - sulfide kits that critically injured soldiers could use in the field to temporarily dim their metabolism and reduce their oxygen demand .
This would help " buy time " until they could get medical attention .
" The military feels that if a soldier can be kept alive for at least three hours , that would allow time for the situation to be stabilized and the scene of the incident secured enough to allow evacuation of that soldier to an area where he or she can get medical attention , " Roth said .
Roth 's study , which attempted to mimic a similar scenario , involved 56 rats , each of which underwent controlled hemorrhage to remove 60 percent of their blood for three hours before re-infusion with Lactated Ringer 's solution to replace lost blood volume .
The rats were divided into two groups .
In the first group , 24 rats were put into a controlled atmosphere of room air laced with 300 parts per million H2S while 13 served as controls .
The H2S was administered about 20 minutes after initiation of blood removal and was supplied for about 20 minutes , until the end of the bleed .
In the second group , 12 rats received a single intravenous dose of sulfide solution about 20 minutes after the initiation of blood removal while seven served as controls .
In both test groups , the rats maintained a reduced yet stable level of carbon - dioxide production , a surrogate measure of metabolism .
Once H2S was removed , metabolic rates returned to normal .
In contrast , the untreated animals steadily grew metabolically weaker from blood loss until the point of death .
Functional and behavioral testing among the long - term survivors ( those that lived more than two weeks after hemorrhage ) showed no observable defects .
In fact , the rodents that were bred produced normal - sized litters of healthy pups .
How does hydrogen - sulfide treatment prevent death from profound and sustained blood loss ?
One possibility is that in reducing metabolism , H2S also reduces oxygen demand , which allows crucial neurons in the hippocampus , the part of the brain that controls autonomic functions such as breathing and heartbeat , to withstand low oxygen levels due to hemorrhage .
Another mechanism may be that hydrogen sulfide , which is naturally present in the blood , is lost during hemorrhage and must be replaced to maintain life processes .
In April 2005 Roth and colleagues made headlines worldwide when they reported , in the journal Science , the first use of H2S to induce a state of reversible hibernation in mice .
Roth 's latest research represents the next step in demonstrating hydrogen sulfide 's potential to treat ischemic injuries caused by conditions such as severe blood loss , hypothermia , cardiac arrest and stroke .

Bush :
Why do n’t you shut up ?
Taking the words of the illustrious King of Spain , in his imbecillic retort to President Hugo Chavez , we use them not as a response to a diatribe but rather , a just retort to an imbecile .
President George W. Bush , why do n’t you shut up ?
Bush :
Why do n’t you shut up ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
In your statement on Monday regarding the legitimate actions of the Russian Federation in Georgia , you failed to mention once the war crimes perpetrated by Georgian military forces , which American advisors support , against Russian and Ossetian civilians .
Kinda embarrassing , eh ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
Your faithful ally , Mikhail Saakashvili , was announcing a ceasefire deal while his troops , with your advisors , were massing on Ossetia ’s border , which they crossed under cover of night and destroyed Tskhinvali , targeting civilian structures just like your forces did in Iraq .
Kinda humanitarian , eh ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
The military forces of your faithful ally , Georgia , supported by American advisors , while on a mission as peacekeepers in Ossetia , were ordered to open fire on Russian peacekeeping forces in the same team .
Kinda noble , eh ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
Your American transport aircraft gave a ride home to thousands of Georgian soldiers from Iraq directly into the combat zone .
Did your boys wish them good luck as they stepped off the aircraft ?
I can almost hear it , “ Give ‘ em Hell ! ” Kinda friendly , eh ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
How do you account for the fact that among the Georgian soldiers fleeing the fighting yesterday you could clearly hear officers using American English giving orders to “ Get back inside ” and how do you account for the fact that there are reports of American soldiers among the Georgian casualties ?
Kinda odd , eh ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
Do you really think anyone gives any importance whatsoever to your words after 8 years of your criminal and murderous regime and policies ?
Do you really believe you have any moral ground whatsoever and do you really imagine there is a single human being anywhere on this planet who does not stick up his middle finger every time you appear on a TV screen ?
Kinda makes ya’ll think , eh ?
Do you really believe you have the right to give any opinion or advice after Abu Ghraib ?
After Guantanamo ?
After the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens ?
After the torture by CIA operatives ?
Kinda difficult , eh ?
Do you really believe you have any right to make a statement on any point of international law after your trumped - up charges against Iraq and the subsequent criminal invasion ?
Like spittin ’ into the wind , right ?
President Bush ,
Why do n’t you shut up ?
Suppose Russia for instance declares that Georgia has weapons of mass destruction ?
And that Russia knows where these WMD are , namely in Tblisi and Poti and north , south , east and west of there ?
And that it must be true because there is “ magnificent foreign intelligence ” such as satellite photos of milk powder factories and baby cereals producing chemical weapons and which are currently being “ driven around the country in vehicles ” ?
Suppose Russia declares for instance that “ Saakashvili stiffed the world ” and it is “ time for regime change ” ?
Nice and simple , is n’t it , President Bush ?
So , why do n’t you shut up ?
Oh and by the way , send some more of your military advisors to Georgia , they are doing a sterling job .
And they look all funny down the night sight , all green .
Hahaha !
Thank you ,
That would be all .

DNS forgery
In theory , cryptography can eliminate all of the DNS attacks described on this web page .
In practice , DNSSEC has received millions of dollars in U.S. government grants and after fifteen years still has not stopped any attacks .
My efforts in this area are now focused on DNSCurve , a completely different way to use cryptography to protect DNS .
November 2002 comments
If you 're running a DNS server , an attacker with access to your network can easily forge responses from that DNS server to other people .
He can steal your incoming mail , for example , and replace your web pages .
An attacker from anywhere on the Internet , without access to the client network and without access to the server network , can also forge responses , although not so easily .
In particular , he has to guess the query time , the DNS ID ( 16 bits ) , and the DNS query port ( 15 - 16 bits ) .
The dnscache program uses a cryptographic generator for the ID and query port to make them extremely difficult to predict .
However ,
an attacker who makes a few billion random guesses is likely to succeed at least once ;
tens of millions of guesses are adequate with a colliding attack ;
against BIND , a hundred thousand guesses are adequate , because BIND keeps using the same port for every query ; and
against old versions of BIND , a thousand guesses are adequate with a colliding attack .
Larger cookies in the DNS protocol could make blind attacks practically impossible .
( Caches could achieve a similar effect without protocol changes by repeating queries a bunch of times with different ports and IDs , at the expense of speed and reliability . )
However , attackers with access to the network would still be able to forge DNS responses .
February 2009 comments
Many DNS software authors issued " emergency " UDP - port - randomization patches in July 2008 .
Some of these patches , and some subsequent patches , also attempted to stop colliding attacks , by combining " duplicate - query suppression " with various other mechanisms .
Kevin Day issued a patch of this type for dnscache in February 2009 .
Day also issued a security alert ( " CVE-2008-4392 " ) stating that dnscache , without duplicate - query suppression , allowed a colliding attack using tens of millions of packets .
Day failed to mention that exactly the same information has been available on this web page since November 2002 .
As far as I know , my July 2001 posting on the topic was the first publication of colliding attacks on DNS .
I have n't reviewed the patches that attempt to stop colliding attacks against dnscache , BIND , etc .
Even if these patches work properly , they are at best a speed bump for blind attackers .
Saying " An attacker has to send billions of packets on average " is like saying " An attacker has to download a movie " ; yes , it takes a little time , but it 's not a serious obstacle .
There is a much simpler way that clients can stop blind attackers without requiring any changes from servers : namely , query repetition , another mechanism that has been discussed on this web page since November 2002 .
Unfortunately , even with query repetition , attackers who control nearby computers can trivially forge DNS responses .
Attackers are estimated to control more than 10 % of the computers on the Internet .
If a computer on your network has been compromised by an attacker anywhere in the world then the attacker can trivially steal your mail by forging DNS packets .
Client - side patches can stop blind attacks , but attacks from nearby computers are not blind .
These patches are an extremely poor substitute for proper cryptographic protection .

Ambassador Ryan Crocker , the top U.S. diplomat in Iraq , in testimony ( .pdf ) this morning before the Senate Armed Services committee , heralded increased Iraqi investment in its own reconstruction , noting $ 18 billion in pending budget allocations by the government in Baghdad and assuring lawmakers that “ the era of U.S. funded major infrastructure projects is over . ”
This would surely be welcome news to committee chairman Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , if only he could bring himself to believe it .
Levin , along with Senator John Warner ( R - Va. ) , has for months been expressing concern that the U.S. continues to shoulder the majority of Iraq ’s reconstruction costs at a time when Iraqi oil exports are finally producing sufficient revenue for the Baghdad government to begin shouldering a greater part of the financial burden .
Last month , the senators asked the GAO to conduct a study of Iraq ’s oil business to determine just how much reconstruction spending should be transferred to the Iraqi side .
Indeed , basic details such as total Iraqi oil revenues since 2003 , how much of it has been spent on reconstruction and security , and how much the Iraqi government has deposited in banks around the world remain unclear , as do projections for expected revenues from oil exports for the coming year .
In their letter to the GAO ’s David Walker , Levin and Warner cite pre-Iraq invasion assurances from the Bush administration that Iraq would be able to pay for its own reconstruction .
“ The oil revenues of that country could bring in between 50 and 100 billion dollars over the course of the next two or three years , ” Paul Wolfowitz told Congress in March 2003 .
“ We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon . ”
This , of course , like almost every other Bush administration contention , turned out to be untrue .
But today , five years after the invasion , Iraqi oil revenues may finally be reaching the levels required to finance major projects .
According to Levin and Warner , Iraq is estimated to have netted $ 41 billion from oil exports in 2007 and is on track to make $ 56 billion for the current year , for a total exceeding $ 100 billion over two years — not exactly chump change .
This morning , in his prepared statement at the opening the Petraeus / Crocker hearing , Levin emphasized Iraq ’s lack of investment in its own reconstruction as evidence of how continued , unending U.S. involvement in the country may only be delaying the day when the Baghdad government will become self - sufficient .
At the very least , Levin contended , Iraq has shown itself content to rely on U.S. handouts for as long as they continue to be offered .
From Levin ’s statement :
Iraq now has tens of billions of dollars in surplus funds in their banks and in accounts around the world , including about $ 30 billion in U.S. banks .
But Iraqi leaders and bureaucrats are n’t spending those funds .
The result is that , far from financing “ its own reconstruction ” as the administration promised five years ago , the Iraqi government has left the U.S. to make most of the capital expenditures needed to provide essential services and improve the quality of life of Iraqi citizens .
American taxpayers are spending vast sums on reconstruction efforts .
For example , the U.S. has spent at least $ 27.6 billion to date on major infrastructure projects , job training , education and training and equipping of the Iraqi Security Forces .
On the other hand , according to the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , the Iraqi Government budgeted $ 6.2 billion for its capital budget in 2006 but spent less than a quarter of it .
As of August 31 , 2007 , the Iraqi Government had spent somewhere between 4.4 percent ( according to the GAO ) and 24 percent ( according to the White House ) of its $ 10.1 billion capital budget for 2007 .
As of last Thursday , the U.S. government is paying the salaries of almost 100,000 Iraqis who are working on reconstruction .
To add insult to injury , in addition to spending tens of billions of U.S. dollars on reconstruction , American taxpayers are also paying three to four dollars a gallon on gas here at home , much of which originates in the Middle East , including Iraq .
The Iraqi government seems content to sit by , build up surpluses and let Americans reconstruct their country and foot the bill .
But the American people surely are n’t content with that , and the Bush administration should n’t be either .
Iraq possesses the world ’s third largest oil reserves , behind Saudi Arabia and Canada , totaling 115 billion barrels .
According to the AP , by February of this year , average daily production had reached 2.4 million barrels , with exports averaging 1.93 million barrels per day .

This is Playlouder 's philosophy , a music download service that allows subscribers to download music from BitTorrent and other filesharing networks , while reimbursing the copyright owners .
The concept sure is interesting , but the current setup is naive , flawed and doomed to fail .
Reports about the new and upcoming legal P2P service “ Playlouder ” are all over the news – again .
Just like three years ago , Playlouder co-founder Paul Sanders manages to generate buzz for his legalized filesharing service .
“ We are confident that we will have something quite good to announce in the next couple of months , ” he said , claiming that his company made a deal with one of the top ISPs in the UK .
The idea is simple ; Playlouder plans to offer subscribers of one of the larger ISPs in the UK a service that will allow them to pirate as much music as they want , for a flat fee .
Customers will be allowed to use the BitTorrent sites and filesharing applications they are used to .
Through Deep Packet Inspection , Playlouder will check what tracks you download , so they can pay the rights holder accordingly .
The idea of creating a service where users can use BitTorrent sites without having to worry about legal repercussions is interesting .
However , despite 5 years of development , the Playlouder team is overlooking some of the most basic features of file - sharing , which will render the service useless .
Playlouder will allow its subscribers to download content from BitTorrent , but they wo n’t allow them to share the files with others who do not use the service .
This restriction is needed because they want to prevent copyright infringement , but it causes a few problems too .
Thou shalt share
The number one rule for BitTorrent users is : Share .
If you do n’t share – upload files to others – your download speeds will reduce dramatically .
This means that it could take hours instead of minutes to download an album from your favorite BitTorrent site .
What Playlouder will offer is a highly degraded version of BitTorrent , and subscribers will not be able to get the great download speeds they are so accustomed to .
BitTorrent Abusers
Torrent sites are not too fond of people who aim to abuse the system .
It would n’t surprise me if most trackers ban Playlouder customers from accessing the service , as they will seriously hurt the download speed of the swarm , and thus the average downloader .
What they ’re technically offering is a Freeleech service , one which does n’t share back to the community .
Together with the decreased download speeds , this means that Playlouder users will not get to enjoy the BitTorrent experience that everyone else gets .
In fact , it will be almost impossible for them to download anything from BitTorrent .
Encryption
Another issue , not so much related to the user experience , is that Playlouder will not be able to track what people are downloading when they enable protocol header encryption .
A significant number of BitTorrent users are using encryption to prevent ISPs from throttling their traffic , but since encryption obfuscates the protocol headers , Playlouder can’t track what their users are downloading .
This then means that artists and labels will not be fully compensated for the tracks these users download .
Let us be clear , we do encourage the search for new business models here at TorrentFreak , where ideally , both artists and consumers benefit .
However , in its current form the Playlouder service is not going to be a great success , if it is more than just another “ vaporshare ” service in the first place .

Government authority is crossing a line
Last week , Eloisa Tamez , 73 , lost the latest round in her ongoing fight with the U.S. government .
A judge ordered her to let Washington survey her land near Brownsville , Texas .
It lies in the path of a proposed border fence .
Now , Tamez , heir to an original Spanish land grant dating to the 1700s , fears that her property will be seized with good reason .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff recently waived more than 30 laws in order to expedite construction of the border fence .
He did so with little regard for the concerns of residents , local officials and environmentalists .
And though the proposed path would cut through the properties of many citizens , it would bypass land owned by the wealthy and politically connected .
The Texas Observer reported that the fence would detour around the River Bend Resort and golf course , as well as developments owned by the Hunt family , whose members are major supporters of President Bush .
The fence would also cause irreparable damage to wildlife ; two Texas nature preserves would wind up in Mexico .
They ’d likely have to close .
Chertoff maintains that the fence is necessary because Americans have been adamant about border security .
Yet two recent polls by CBS and CNN show that Americans rank illegal immigration lowest on their short list of the most pressing national problems .

John McCain , in his first television interview since his shocking vice presidential pick , said that he saw in Sarah Palin " a partner and a soul mate . "
" This is a person who will help me reform Washington and change the way they do business , " McCain told Chris Wallace on " Fox News Sunday . "
McCain was pressed by Wallace as to whether Palin , a 44 - year - old governor who has yet to finish her second year in office , was the most qualified choice he could have made for his No. 2 .
" What this brings is a spirit of reform and change that is vital now in our nation 's capital , " he offered .
And , using a line often deployed by Barack Obama when he 's questioned about his lack of foreign policy credentials , McCain said Palin has " got the right judgment . "
Palin , he noted , had backed the surge of troops in Iraq .
But McCain did try to point out what experience she had , touting a single visit to Kuwait she made and her role as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard .
And he also contrasted her sharply with Barack Obama .
" When she was in office , he was a community organizer , " McCain said , alluding to Palin 's time on the Wasilla , Alaska , city council in the '90s .
McCain also used the contrast to tout her maverick tendencies .
" Sen Obama has never taken on the leaders of his own party , " McCain said , while making the case that Palin " has been an independent spirit and taken on her own party at every turn . "
Seeking to make a positive out of Palin 's paucity of national political experience , McCain , himself a fixture among the capital 's political elite , boasted that she had never been on " Meet the Press " and was not a regular at " Georgetown cocktail parties . "
" I say thank God " about her lack of a Beltway background , he said with a smile .

Imagine if a group of rabid creationists started fire - bombing the homes of University of California professors to prevent them from teaching evolution .
Area politicians would be holding competing press conferences to assure the public that they would take on the violent zealots , who have declared war , not only on good academics and their families , but on science itself .
No need to imagine .
Across California , a different group of zealots has done just that .
True believers have distributed personal information on scientists and their families .
They 've placed firebombs in medical researchers ' homes and cars .
They 've donned hoods on their heads and marched to the homes of professors , then banged on their doors .
They 've told children that their parents are evil murderers and chalked anonymous charges on sidewalks for the neighbors to see .
The difference is these zealots are n't fighting for religious fundamentalism .
Extremist animal rights groups have organized anonymously to intimidate and terrorize medical researchers until they abandon their studies out of fear for their children 's safety and their own peace of mind .
They perfected the art of intimidation in the United Kingdom .
First , extremists vandalized research labs .
Then , they targeted companies that did business with researchers .
In 2004 , activists finally went too far when they dug up the remains of the mother - in - law of a guinea - pig breeder .
Now animal rights extremists are targeting University of California researchers .
First , they placed bombs that did not go off .
When that did n't shut down labs , they ratcheted up the violence .
Wanted posters warned UC Santa Cruz researchers : " Animal abusers everywhere beware ; we know where you live ; we know where you work ; we will never back down until you end your abuse . "
Early Saturday morning , a firebomb destroyed a car belonging to a UCSC scientist .
Shortly afterward , a firebomb erupted in the nearby townhouse of assistant biology professor David Feldheim .
As smoke and flames filled the first floor , Feldheim , his wife , their 7 - year - old son and 6 - year - old daughter were forced to use a drop ladder to escape from a second - floor bedroom .
Jerry Vlasak , who , as a spokesman for the Animal Liberation Press Office , serves as an apologist for animal rights zealots , issued this statement : " This is historically what happens whenever revolutionaries begin to take the oppression and suffering of their fellow beings seriously , whether human or nonhuman .
It 's regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age . "
Tom Holder , of the group Speaking of Research , a student outreach organization , saw what happened in the United Kingdom , and he sees the same escalation of violence and harassment in the United States .
Holder also saw the tide of public opinion turn against animal rights nuts in Great Britain when students and professors , who had been cowed into silence , began to speak out in favor of a proposed biomedical research laboratory at Oxford University .
The majority prevailed , and the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre was built .
" We must not allow a violent minority to dictate the future of medicine , " Holder noted , when cures and knowledge can save so many lives .
Too often American universities have tried to downplay animal rights terrorism .
Researchers clam up , lest they be next .
The harassment campaigns " tend to isolate individuals , " Holder noted .
But the terrorists cannot prevail when scientists stand together for their work .
UCSC professor Marty Chemers already had called a rally for 5 p.m.
Monday to express outrage at these attacks .
" These are people who want to do violence and they cloak themselves in this kind of moral stance , " Chemers told me .
Though unfamiliar with the animal rights movement , Chemers , a social psychologist , nailed it .
This is not a movement interested in the welfare and humane treatment of laboratory animals .
It is an anarchistic , misanthropic cult .
To bring home that point , the Humane Society of the United States has offered a $ 2,500 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for Saturday 's firebombings .
HSUS President Wayne Pacelle told me , " This behavior is at odds with the core values of respect and compassion that we espouse in our work at the Humane Society . "
We would n't let these zealots burn the university 's books .
But if they prevail , these extremists will have cowed scientists , destroyed research labs , and with them any cures they might invent .

The FDA lacks sufficient funds to properly monitor emerging technologies and threats , and as such is unable to properly regulate new technologies , drugs and foods , according to a report by the agency 's Subcommittee on Science and Technology .
The FDA 's resources are going mostly into responding to crises , the report said , leaving the FDA unable to be proactive about emerging threats .
" Crisis management in the FDA 's two food safety centers ... has drawn attention and resources away from FDA 's ability to develop the science base and infrastructure needed to efficiently support innovation in the food industry , provide effective routine surveillance , and conduct emergency outbreak investigation activities to protect food , " the report said .
The report cites nanotechnology as an example of an area where the FDA has failed to monitor rapidly emerging science .
Although nanotechnology is fundamentally different from prior technologies , the FDA has failed to regulate it any differently .
The subcommittee recommended the formation of a department dedicated to liaising with groups involved in new technologies .
The FDA has also fallen short in its responsibility to inspect the U.S. food supply , the report says .
Funding for food inspection has dropped over the past 35 years , leading to a 78 percent reduction in the frequency of inspections .
Currently , food manufacturers are inspected only once every 10 years , and retail establishments and farms are never inspected .
At the same time , the report notes , the food industry has rapidly expanded , and so have food imports .
Even in the area of crisis management , the report says , the FDA has still fallen short , particularly with new and emerging threats .
For example , when bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , or " mad cow disease , " first appeared in Europe and the FDA imposed new regulations on animal feed , the government denied the agency funding to implement those new rules .
According to the report , this allowed BSE to infect U.S. cattle .
Iraq : Even If We Win We Lose
Mr. Benjamin , PhD University of Pennsylvania , is a retired professor of history ( Foreign Policy and International Relations ) .
He is the author of A Student 's Guide to History .
Has George W. Bush surged to victory in Iraq ?
If so , he can thank Iraqi tribalism , the success of ethnic cleansing , the loss of legitimacy by Al Qaida in Iraq , the “ standing down ” of the Sunni militias and Iran ’s willingness to let its friends in Baghdad make their own peace with Washington .
The anti-U.S. Shia militia of Muktada al Sadr also left the field .
Only one factor behind victory was made - in - USA : the success , finally , of the counterinsurgency wing of the U.S. military in shifting tactics from policing a civil war to dividing the insurgency .
Why it took five years to figure this out is worth pondering .
Nevertheless , the shift in tactics would not have made much difference had not the other developments also occurred .
By that time the damage to Iraq , to our military and economy had already occurred .
While the Bush administration may have been surging to victory , most Americans came to realize that the war , sold as a way to eliminate Saddam ’s WMDs and his secret alliance with Osama Bin Laden and to spread the blessings of liberty throughout the Middle East , had very different aims .
One did n’t need to be a conspiracy theorist to conclude that the war was mainly geostrategic in its goals .
Saddam was evil but less because he “ gassed his own people ” ( he also gassed Iranians but they do n’t count ) than because he had the will ( and might at some point have had the ability ) to use his military forces and Iraqi oil reserves to upset the strategic balance in the Middle East .
He might have evaded sanctions , sold Iraqi oil for Euros rather than dollars , threatened Israel , intimidated the emirates , invaded Saudi Arabia , etc .
Then again , conscious of his own weakness , he might not have done any of these things .
The war came when the Bush administration decided to eliminate these geostrategic risks by preemptive war .
For the administration , the evil dictator theme worked long enough and well enough to defy opposition to the war .
Many Americans and much of the media had heard the vague references to the roles of strategic position and oil wealth .
But they were satisfied that the “ real ” motives were things that they ( or someone else ) could properly die for .
There were very large anti-war demonstrations well before the leaks and exposes of the post -2003 period .
Many Americans refused to accept the lies and the imperial motives that hid behind them .
Still , the Bush administration was able to move toward war because many Americans , fooled or not , wanted to “ liberate ” Iraq ; wanted to secure access to oil ; wanted to “ stand tall . ”
Even when they could peek behind the curtain , they did not look too closely .
A similar orientation explains the reaction of much of the media and of the opposition in Congress .
Of course there were news organizations and political forces that found the lies easy to believe or that accepted the need for them .
More significant was that most of the media was not willing to challenge a “ wartime ” president .
Once George Bush − with the aid of the events of 9/11 − declared war on terror , his power was immense .
In newsrooms and minority caucuses people were susceptible to the fear that powerful political voices and many millions of Americans would easily label dissent at that point as treason .
To be effective , opposition forces had to face that fear directly .
It would have to challenge the lies of the administration at a time when evidence of them was not great and when even saying that the president was “ lying ” made one 's own motives suspect .
It would have to challenge the coziness with power of some media and the fear of that power by others .
Most difficult perhaps , it would have to challenge the fear of the American people , their trust in their leaders , and , in some , the desire to hear the eagle scream again .
Finally , war with Afghanistan had gone unchallenged and had already been “ won . ”
In the coming months we will again face the difficulty of challenging one war while accepting another , especially when much of the justification for one has been applied to the other .
Some Americans want to live in the seat of an empire .
For them pre-emptive war is not so difficult to justify .
When America invades other nations because they might threaten its interests and when it consciously chooses war because it possesses huge military forces , then citizens of the empire can be proud − even while others are ashamed .
The main danger of geostrategic wars ( aside from their “ collateral damage ” ) is that our republic can be grievously wounded by them .
A war fought by a republic is lawful and in defense of values that serve the republic .
This is why lies become necessary and not only to hide the true motives but to allow us to look away when the sausage of empire is being made .
Demonizing the enemy and questioning the loyalty of any who challenge the policy help us to believe that our empire somehow serves our republic when the opposite is the case .
Reasonable citizens of a republic may understand that conducting high - tech war abroad does little to prevent small groups of terrorists from flying planes into office towers ; that an aggressive , militaristic foreign policy assures that a “ war on terror ” of some kind will never end .
Still , we should not assume that such points are obvious or persuasive .
The irony implicit in an “ empire of liberty ” is one that has haunted us from the start .
Now it offers us a war to assure our economic interests in the Middle East .
It declares victory in that war just as the structure of the U.S. economy begins to topple .
The rent fabric of the rule of law may now catch on the broken windows of abandoned homes .

I would like to see when there has ever been a legal war .
It barely caused a ripple when India and Pakistan almost went to war a couple of seasons ago - no oil involved .
I believe Gaddafi admitted Libya had WMD's and they finally accepted international " carrots " and he dismantled them .
It may be , like the WWII Coventry bombing disclosure by the British government , years after the fact , that WMD's were in Iraq and are now in Syria or Iran or etc .
Not much said about the recent wiping out of an alleged nuclear installation in Syria by Israel .
Thank you Israel for taking action against Iraq and wiping out that nuclear installation before Saddam had a chance to use them .
Inaction and cynicism supports your local dictator .
Hey , we 're voting out the " Emperor " in November !
Raul A Garcia - 8/23/2008
Thank you Mr. Hughes !
It would be great if we could retreat to scholarship funded seminars , " down with the empire " chat rooms , conspiracy conferences , or put our heads in the sand and sip latte through dialectical straws as some others imply .
I would rather take action and know I took a stand rather than lapse into cynical indifference and let the dictators move with impunity .
Who misses Hussein , Milosevic ?
I will not miss Castro or Mugabe either .
Once our elected " emperor " is deposed / voted out , who will be the object of hate for the simplifiers of history ?
Lawrence Brooks Hughes - 8/22/2008
I have trouble putting any confidence in " international law , " and also in calling the overthrow of Saddam " illegal . "
It might more readily be called a humanitarian act to stop mass murder , which , parenthetically , it was .
I can't see any difference between " preemptive " and " preventive , " either .
There is a case to be made that the weapons of mass destruction today are far worse than ever before in history , which might justify a preventive war today which in an earlier time was not justifiable .
But we have been engaged in foreign military interventions for as long as we have been a nation , well before WMD , beginning with Jefferson 's excursion into Tripoli .
In the 20th century we sent troops to China , Haiti , Mexico , Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Murmansk in 1920 , Grenada , Panama , Bosnia , Kosovo , Somalia , and probably elsewhere , in addition to all the major wars .
You can call those smaller events " illegal " all you wish .
The truth is they were intended to be peace keeping activities , they mostly helped to improve the world , and often the United States was motivated heavily by altruism .
( And Iraq was no exception ) .
jay sumu -
8/19/2008 - Dr. Benjamin is incorrect when he uses the word preemptive invasion .
The illegal war of aggression against Iraq was hardly defensive in nature in need of imminent action .
Therefore it was a preventive war , an important distinction in terms of international law .
- I do n't think anyone is doubting the patriotism of George Bush or his love of country .
Many despots around the world and history have acted in the best interest of their nation or so they thought , damn the consequences .
- The no-fly - zone was an illegal creation of the Americans .
Iraq like Georgia is a member - state of the United Nations with internationally recognized boundaries which need to respected .
There should n’t be any question about the territorial integrity of Georgia / Iraq .
The no -fly - zone was an obvious violation of Iraqi territory and sovereignty .
- The preventive war against Yugoslavia was also illegal under international law .
- As for the prosperity of Iraq , I do n't think it matters much whether they are democratic or not .
Saudi Arabia is hardly democratic or a liberal society and yet they are very propserous .
China is hardly democratic or has stellar human rights records yet they will become the most powerful economy .
It probably would have been easier and cheaper to have dealt with Iraq diplomatically rather than attempt illegal regime change .
jay sumu - 8/19/2008
Yes that 's correct .
Human rights violations committed by a sovereign state does not give an automatic green light for invasion .
Otherwise it would give any country on the planet the right to bomb the USA .
jay sumu - 8/19/2008
The illegal war of aggression against Iraq was not defensive in nature .
Therefore it is a preventive war , not preemptive .
Lawrence Brooks Hughes - 8/19/2008 Dr. Benjamin is on thin ice if he denies that the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq looked like the best option to President Bush at the time .
Remember that Democrat CIA Director George Tenet told Bush it was a " slamdunk " to assume Saddam had WMD and was likely to use them .
It may have been a mistake -- I think not -- but if so , it was an honest one .
Bush is a man who always tells the truth , and to look at him is to appreciate he is the quintessential Middle American Christian who likes ballgames and back - yard barbeques .
It is impossible to doubt his patriotism or devotion to his country , or to impute to him imperialistic desires .
That is just not part of his nature .
He does what he considers to be in the best interests of the United States -- as he is supposed to do .
We had been paying heavy bribes to Israel and Egypt and Jordan and others for several decades to keep peace in the Middle East , and all it got us was worse carnage than ever in the form of child suicide bombers .
Our friends in Europe were letting us do the heavy lifting of the No - Fly - Zone , which was costing us billions as well as airmen .
The UN was worthless , as always .
To his credit , Bush recognized we had to do something different , and acted .
His pre-emptive strike into Iraq was just as reasonable as our pre-emptive strike into Yugoslavia a few years earlier .
We have now created an independent , democratic state in the heart of Mesopotamia .
It will become very prosperous , sitting on so much oil .
The realistic hope is it will remain democratic , become envied by its neighbors , and then copied by them .
Over the long pull , especially if other states around Iraq also become democratic , the entire region will be transformed for the better .
The swamp will have been drained .
It now looks like this policy was at least worth a try .
Tim Matthewson - 8/19/2008
When asked about the improved security situation in Iraq , al - Malaki listed only domestic consideration as leading to the reduction in violence .
Pointedly he specifically avoided giving any credit to George Bush and the Surge .
The same is true of other Iraqi politicians .
omar ibrahim baker - 8/19/2008 Professor
Benjamin should be slightly lauded for his , though very brief , reference to " the geostrategic goals " of the Iraqi conquest .... amazingly seldom noted and usually flagrantly absent hitherto from any discussion of the question .
However his failure to high light the decisive role played therein by the Israel / AIPAC factor detracts from the value of his timid contribution by equating it , en passant , with such factors as " sell Iraqi oil for Euros ... " etc .
According to a very well informed man of the administration , a man well versed in the inner goings on and extremely knowledgeable about the inner forces formulating US policy , particularly under president Bush , according to Philip Zelikow . , as reported in the noted below article Zelikow HAD ABSOLUTELY no doubt about what was the real motive behind the USA / BUSH decision to conquer and destroy Iraq .
Latter denials never touched on the actual words Zelikow used at the University of Virginia . :
His words : " Why would Iraq attack America or use nuclear weapons against us ?
I 'll tell you what I think the real threat [ is ] and actually has been since 1990 - it's the threat against Israel , "
Zelikow told a crowd at the University of Virginia on September 10 , 2002 , speaking on a panel of foreign policy experts assessing the impact of September 11 and the future of the war on al - Qaeda . “
Two points re Zelikow :
1 - He had the highest degree of access , and security clearance , to the inner most circles of the decision making centers at the White house
AND
2 - He said whatever he had to say about the real motives behind the conquest of Iraq while still serving at the White house .
Is it fear or self delusion or a combination of both that consistently down plays the decisive importance of the AIPAC / Israel factor in what is turning out to be a catastrophically ill advised and hugely expensive demarche by the USA to the USA both as a nation and as a state ??

Michael Davis - 8/18/2008
So what you 're saying is the US should no longer go into any region where there are human rights violations , correct ?
This would preclude us from going into Bosnia , Haiti , Panama , Lebanon , Darfur , Afghanistan , and anywhere else our executive would like to put us , am I correct ?
I mean , it 's fine with me , and most other Americans .
The simple fact is the money to do these things has run out , and our influence on the world is slowly going to wane from here on out .
Might be for the better .
Sarah Ayton , Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson claimed a gold medal for Britain with
victory in the Yngling medal race at the Olympic sailing regatta today .
In what amounted to a two - horse race for the gold against the Netherlands in
the Yngling class , Team GB came home in first place for the first time in the
regatta with the Dutch trailing in fifth in heavy conditions on the Yellow Sea .
And there were three more golden moments as Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase won the lightweight men's double sculls in the rowing , sailor Ben Ainslie won the Finn class and cyclist Rebecca Romero won the women 's individual pursuit .
The British trio of Ayton , Webb and Wilson entered the regatta as heavy favourites after dominating the Yngling class for the past two years , winning back - to - back world championships , last year 's Olympic test event in Qingdao and this year 's European
championships .
But they went into the medal race with only a slender one - point advantage after
finishing fifth behind the winning Dutch crew of Mandy Mulder , Annermieke Bes
and Merel Witteveen in the eighth and final preliminary race on Friday .
Light , unsettled wind conditions saw the race being postponed from Saturday but
the boats were eventually flagged off in much heavier conditions 24 hours later
as strong winds and heavy rain descended on the waters off Qingdao .
The Dutch had the jump on the British boat at the start but it was Team GB that
reached the windward mark first , just a second in front of the Dutch and the
rest of the field .
They maintained their lead at the second mark and although they were overtaken
by Germany during the second leg , the Netherlands had dropped back to sixth , 51
seconds adrift of the British .
Ayton , Webb and Wilson regained the lead on the run to the finish line and
crossed the line seven seconds ahead of Germany and a minute in front of the
fifth - placed Dutch .
The Netherlands took the silver while Greece finished in third place in the
race to secure the bronze medal .
The crew were understandably thrilled about their win and Sarah Webb is
predicting more success for the crew in years to come .
She said : " I 'm lost for words , it is such a relief .
Our experience was
everything , we stayed sure and we got better . "
Ayton added : " It 's been brilliant , this campaign has been about pure
perfection and we 're just an awesome team . "
Wilson , who joined up with Webb and Ayton after their gold medal in Athens with
Shirley Robertson four years ago , was delighted with her first prize .
" This has been the dream and it has n't really sunk in , " she said .
Obama adviser : McCain is with the Dick Cheney wing of the Bush administration David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday June 27 , 2008

Print This Email This North Korea has recently taken significant steps towards nuclear disarmament , leading the Bush administration to lift some sanctions and notify Congress that North Korea will be removed from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism .
Susan Rice , a former Assistant Secretary of State and senior foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama , told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Friday that these events represent " an important , albeit modest , first step . "
" What we see is that diplomacy , direct diplomacy , can in fact yield modest results , " Rice stated .
" We would not have gotten this far if the Bush administration had not belatedly ... [ turned ] to negotiations .
Now , John McCain is with the Dick Cheney wing of the Bush administration ... "
Scarborough interrupted Rice at that point to challenge her use of the word " belatedly . "
He also asked her , " Are you just saying that this is ' a modest step ' because you 're in the middle of a political campaign ? "
" It 's in fact what President Bush said yesterday , " Rice explained .
" There 's a lot we still do n't know .
We do n't know what 's happened to North Korea 's suspected uranium enrichment program ... the nuclear material that it 's already made ... whether it 's proliferated its technology to Syria or other places of concern . "
Rice then returned to her suggestion that " had we listened to Dick Cheney and , indeed , John McCain , we would not have this progress today . "
" John McCain opposed negotiations , " Rice emphasized .
" In 1994 , he advocated airstrikes against North Korea and threatened North Korea with extinction .
Had we done that we would be in a very , very different place than we are today . "

We ’ve made a lot of changes ( and more importantly , a lot of positive progress ) in security UI for Firefox 3 .
We have built - in malware protection now , and better phishing protection .
We have a password manager that intelligently lets you see whether your login was successful before saving , instead of interrupting the page load .
We have gotten rid of several security dialogs that taught users to click OK automatically , unseeingly .
We have OCSP on by default .
We have a consistent place in the UI now where users can get information about the site they are visiting , including detailed secondary information about their history with the site ; all of which are first steps in a long road towards equipping users with more sophisticated tools for browsing online , by taking advantage of habits they already have , and things we already know .
All the people who worked on this stuff know who they are , and I want to thank them , because it sure as hell was n’t all me .
With Firefox 3 in full down - hunker for final release ( and with conference silly season upon us ) though , I ’ve started to get serious about thinking through what comes next .
Here ’s my initial list of the 3 things I care most about , what have I missed ?
1. Key Continuity Management
Key continuity management is the name for an approach to SSL certificates that focuses more on “ is this the same site I saw last time ? ” instead of “ is this site presenting a cert from a trusted third party ? ”
Those approaches do n’t have to be mutually exclusive , and should n’t in our case , but supporting some version of this would let us deal more intelligently with crypto environments that do n’t use CA - issued certificates .
The exception mechanism in Firefox 3 is a very weak version of KCM , in that security exceptions , once manually added , do have “ KCM - ish ” properties ( future visits are undisturbed , changes are detected ) .
But without the whole process being transparent to users , we miss the biggest advantage to this approach .
Why I care : KCM lets us eliminate the most - benign and most - frequently - occurring SSL error in Firefox 3 .
Self - signed certs are n’t intrinsically dangerous , even if they do lack any identification information whatsoever .
The problem is that case - by - case , we do n’t have a way to know if a given self - signed cert represents an attack in progress .
The probability of that event is low , but the risk is high , so we get in the way .
That ’s not optimal , though .
When the risk is negligible , we should get out of the way , and save our warnings for the times when they can be most effective .
2. Secure Remote Passwords
Secure Remote Password protocol is a mechanism ( have some math ! ) for allowing a username / password - style exchange to happen , without an actual password going out along the wire .
Rob Sayre already has a patch .
That patch makes the technology available , but putting together a UI for it that resists spoofing ( and is attractive enough that sites want to participate ) will be interesting .
Why I care : SRP is not the solution to phishing , but it does make it harder to make use of stolen credentials , and that ’s already a big deal .
It also has the happy side effect of authenticating the site to you while it ’s authenticating you to the site .
I would n’t want this useful technology to get stuck in the chicken - egg quagmire of “ you implement it first . ”
3. Private Browsing Mode
This is the idea of a mode for Firefox which would protect their privacy more aggressively , and erase any trace of having been in that mode after the fact .
Ehsan Akhgari has done a bunch of work here , and in fact has a working patch .
While his version hooks into all the various places we might store personal data , I ’ve also wondered about a mode where we just spawn a new profile on the spot ( possibly with saved passwords intact ) and then delete it once finished .
Why I care : Aside from awkward teenagers ( and wandering fiancés ) , there are a lot of places in the world where the sites you choose to visit can be used as a weapon against you .
Private browsing mode is not some panacea for governmental oppression , but as the user ’s agent , I think it is legitimately within our scope ( and morally within our responsibility ) to put users in control of their information .
We began this thinking with the “ Clear Private Data ” entry in the tools menu , but I think we can do better .
( And also … )
Outside of these 3 , there are a couple things that I know will get some of my attention , but involve more work to understand before I can talk intelligently about how to solve them .
The first is for me to get a better understanding of user certificates .
In North America ( outside of the military , at least ) client certificates are not a regular matter of course for most users , but in other parts of the world , they are becoming downright commonplace .
As I understand it , Belgium and Denmark already issue certs to their citizenry for government interaction , and I think Britain is considering its options as well .
We ’ve fixed some bugs in that UI in Firefox 3 , but I think it ’s still a second - class UI in terms of the attention it has gotten , and making it awesome would probably help a lot of users in the countries that use them .
If you have experience and feedback here , I would welcome it .
The second is banging on the drum about our mixed content detection .
We have some very old bugs in the area , and mixed content has the ability to break all of our assumptions about secure connections .
I think it ’s just a matter of getting the right people interested in the problem , so it may be that the best way for me to solve this is with bottles of single malt .
Whatever it takes .
If you can help here , name your price .
Obviously I ’ve left out all the tactical fixup work on the UI we already have .
We all know that those things will need to happen , to be re-evaluated and evolved .
I wanted to get these bigger - topic thoughts out early , so that people like you can start thinking about whether they are interesting and relevant to the things you care about , and shouting angrily if they are n’t .
For some sites , reviewing video games is n't about helping consumers make better decisions , nor is it about serious criticism of the art form .
Game reviews , and the process of writing them , is a scramble to get the first review out — an exclusive if possible — in order to get the most readers to sell the most ads .
Reviewers will do a lot to get their hands on a game as early as possible , and with the very real financial reward given to sites that get the reviews out the quickest , the publishers have more power over the process than most readers probably realize .
When reviewers can't speak freely
Reviewing games in general is a tough process , simply because it can take upwards of 20 hours to fully play a title , and that may or may not include multiplayer time .
It 's not as simple as listening to an album or watching a film ; there is a substantial time commitment .
Games often come with " review guides " for this purpose , and the packets can come with cheat codes , descriptions of key scenes , and even " advice " on what should be pointed out in the review 's editorial .
In many cases , there are things that the publisher asks you not to mention the review .
In the vast majority of cases , this is n't ethically troubling : who wants to give away plot twists in a review anyway ?
In other cases , things get slippery : for sites running reviews of Metal Gear Solid 4 , there is apparently a long list of things that reviewers can't mention .
The issue is that we 're not talking about plot , it has been rumored that reviewers are being asked not to comment on the length of cut scenes or the size of the game 's install on the PlayStation 3's hard drive .
The review on IGN UK is frank about this .
It begins , " In return for letting us play Metal Gear Solid 4 before its release , Konami issued us with a list of things that we 're not allowed to discuss .
This list of prohibited topics is pretty long , and even extends as far as several facts that the company itself has already made public . "
Later the reviewer notes that " One of those things that Konami does n't want us to talk about is the ' total length of cut- scenes ' . "
These are n't small omissions , but relevant information gamers would probably want included in a review .
Would you sit through an hour - long cut scene ?
Would a 30 - minute cut scene be any better ?
Until the game is released , you wo n't know much information about these movies ; in order to get access to the game , reviewers agreed not to give you that information .
Financially , it 's a good move .
It 's the gamers that miss out .
The value of exclusive reviews
The next issue , and this is perhaps even more troubling , is the act of handing out exclusive reviews .
This is basically the only way that print can compete with the online media these days : the writer gets to play the game , write the review , and then the rest of the sites have to hold their reviews until the time is up on that exclusive .
Whenever you see the words " exclusive review , " keep in mind that the outlet in question was essentially handed a check .
Exclusive reviews are huge business , draw in huge numbers of readers — and that 's worth a whole lot of money and prestige .
Keep in mind that the rush of readers is n't the only power of exclusive reviews : gaming blogs like Kotaku , Destructoid , and , yes , Opposable Thumbs , often work as chop - shops when it comes to reviews .
If the review talks about the game 's length , or includes a list of weapons or interesting features , that data will then be talked about across the blogs .
Since everyone will link back to the original review , the Google score goes up , the site gets weighted heavier in searches , and the review gets an even longer tail .
It 's very literally impossible to put a dollar amount on the value of an exclusive review .
Imagine you have a hot game , and most of the gaming media wants to get that exclusive review ; they know the money they are worth for their sites or magazines .
The publisher then gets to pick and choose whom to give that gift to .
The criteria for that choice ?
No one who wants to keep their job will ever say , but with so much at stake , the publisher has a huge stick to wave , and even without an exclusive , reviewers seem more than happy to withhold important information from readers .
Imagine what temptations are there when there is all that money to be made ?
Other pitfalls
These are n't the only things you have to look out for ; in some cases games that are n't finished are reviewed .
You may hear about what the developer promises to fix or change before launch — or you may not .
Sometimes members of the development team are in the room when this goes on .
It 's hard to know how to take a review like that .
After all , it 's not the game you 'll be buying at release , and if the reviewer says it 's easy to jump in and play , will it be easy for those of us who do n't have the guy who designed the control scheme telling us exactly how to play ?
Exclusive reviews of big - name titles like Grand Theft Auto IV are worth a large dollar amount
Game reviews are a lot like laws and sausages : the process of creating them is rarely pretty .
The difference is , with reviews , you do want to know what went into them .
Is this an exclusive ?
Was the game reviewed a finished version ?
Did a developer walk the reviewer through the game ?
What are n't people allowed to say ?
I will say that I 've never been asked to do anything I 've been troubled by when writing a review , but we 've also never dealt with the exclusive issue .
We often buy games at retail and spend more time than other sites playing them — which is not to say that other sites do n't write thorough , honest , and informative reviews .
It 's not that there is much direct evidence that the system is corrupt , but when all the major players are this defensive about the process of reviewing games , and there is this much money at stake , it 's important to read reviews critically and try to figure out what could have influenced that all - important final score .
Gaming is one of the few art forms where being able to critically review a release is this political , and if people are becoming more distrustful of professionally - written reviews , that could be a healthy reaction .
The publishers control the careers and fates of review sites in a very real way ; with everything from ad revenue , to access to future games , and even your job being on the line , it 's not surprising that high review scores are so common .

Did the Economic Stimulus Plan Overstimulate Some ?
A Guest Post
Bill Tancer is the general manager of research at Hitwise , which analyzes Internet trends and data ranging from American Idol predictions to which days of the week are most popular for porn searching .
He has appeared on this blog quite a few times .
He is the author of a new book , Click : What Millions of People Are Doing Online and Why it Matters , and he has agreed to write some guest posts here on the subject .
This is the first of three .
AIMRco , the Adult Internet Market Research Company issued a press release earlier this month claiming that , based on a survey of an unspecified number of adult entertainment websites , “ many sites have experienced between a 20 to 30 percent growth in membership rates since mid-May when the [ stimulus ] checks were first sent out , and typically the summer is a slow period for this market . ”
The release goes on to quote the spokeswoman for an adult website which fielded a survey of new members , revealing that 32 percent of respondents “ referenced the recent stimulus package as part of their decision to either become a new member , or renew an existing membership . ”
Utilizing the Hitwise sample of ten million anonomized U.S. Internet users , I blogged my initial reaction here .
By grouping together the top 37,706 websites in our adult category — which when combined account for over 10 percent of Internet traffic on any given day — we can chart the daily patterns of visits to those sites .
As a side note , the daily peaks ( Fridays ) and troughs ( Sundays ) of visits to adult sites do not vary over the last three years of data .
Examining the trend since January , there does appear to be an increase in visits that begins late April into mid June .
But is that increase remarkable ?
Looking at a weekly comparison of visits to those same sites in 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 reveals that although there has been a steady drop in adult visits over the years , in mid May 2008 visits to the category continued to remain stable despite seasonal declines the previous two years .
While there is n’t enough data to establish correlation let alone causation , another dataset provides additional clues as to the change in summer prurient interests .
When comparing the average household incomes of visitors to the adult category for May 2007 versus May 2008 , one segment stands out .
Households earning between $ 30,000 and $ 60,000 per year increased from 28.3 percent in May 2007 to 31.3 percent in May 2008 ( the

After discovering a home which was very easy to break into , a burglar decided to leave a note to the house 's owners .
The note called the residents of the house " dumb arse " because they did n't turn on their alarm system .
The home was located in the Christchurch suburb of Avonhead .
It was robbed on Monday .
After the house 's owners came back home , they discovered the note , which read " Put your cat out and turn your alarm on dumb arse . "
For the first time the Christchurch police 's inspector Gary Knowles mentioned that police agreed with the burglar .
" Please use whatever security you have - and it may be as simple as locking the back door or remembering to activate the alarm when you go out , " he said .
Mr Knowles outlined that a lot of people did not use their alarm system .
He mentioned that the alarm should be turned on and people should never forget to use it .
" When you are off to bed , or just watching television , remember to lock the back door !
Take the hint and remember Fred Flintstone and the TVNZ cat ; when you 've put the cat out , lock the door , " he said .
The police inspector said that although the burglaries often take place when there is a spate , the current crime in Christchurch happened when people where at home leaving several entries in the house completely insecure .
" Recent files read : Entry via unlocked rear door ; Entry via unlocked garage window ; Entry via lounge window ... the list goes on . "
Mr Knowles said that in one case when the burglars were unable to get the television they decided to take lunches from the fridge .
According to statistics almost 70 percent of burglaries occurred during the day on weekdays and at night on weekend .
" Make things difficult for burglars .
They like to make easy money , " outlined the police inspector .

In recent days I ’ve seen post after post ( after post after post ) of atheist bloggers writing a page full of links and putting it on their weblog .
I was mildly amused at first but seeing people continue to do it , I decided to write a short post on why this is not only useless , but may actually harm you .
First of all …
1. Who Cares ?
I ’m always confused on why so many people hunt this precious authority in the first place .
I can honestly say that I have never , ever found a blog from its authority .
Nor have I ever rated a blog from it .
Hell , I have n’t even had my opinion improve by noticing how much authority a site has .
Your technorati authority is an ego stroke , plain and simple .
Nobody gives a rat ’s ass about what anyone else ’s authority is but his own .
On the other hand , do you know what makes me more interested in a blog ?
2. Subscribers
When I see that little feedburner icon showing a decent number of subscribers I always think something like “ If so many people have subscribed to her , she must have something interesting to say ” .
What makes you more interested .
Seeing my Authority ?
Or seeing how many subscribers I have ?
Alright , alright , you caught me .
I do n’t really have that many subscribers ( I ’d wish ) .
These are actually vjack ‘s but I borrowed them to make a point [ 1 .
Btw , does anyone consider it insane how many subscribers that man has !
He must be faking it somehow … I ’m certain of it ! :P ] .
Your subscribers are much more important than your authority and you should n’t sacrifice the former for the later ( see point 4 )
3. Punishment
When you make posts like these you may assume that you are selflessly helping others bloggers get a better authority ( see point 1 ) but what you have to have in mind is that both Search engines and Technorati are not idiots .
When Google sees a new blog having 300 links one after another , little bells start ringing , gears start turning and sooner or later you start suffering the results .
Some of you might not care but seeing as you do n’t really achieve anything with it , why do it ?
If this kind of thing worked , do you know what would have been at the top positions ?
Splogs .
How difficult to you think it is for 10.000 of them to join a blogroll and jump to the first places ?
Do n’t be annoyed that you ca n’t game the system .
Be happy that the system cannot be gamed .
4. Annoyance
Have you had the situation where you see a new post from your favourite blog in your aggregator , opened it and was treated to a page full of linkspam ?
I know I have .
Have you had the situation where you see a linkback , get all excited about it , follow it back only to discover a linkfarm ?
I know I have .
It is simply annoying .
Do n’t treat your loyal readers like that .
5. Relativity
There ’s millions of blogs on the internetubes at the moment and thousands of them are vying for this all - important technorati authority .
What most do n’t realise is that people do n’t care who ’s on the top 10 ( it ’s usually tech blogs and lolcats ) but rather who ’s the authority on the subjects of one ’s interests .
Technorati can’t tell you that .
6 . You ’re doing it wrong
Do you know why blogrolls are generally not counted by search engines and technorati ?
Because they are irrelevant .
A Blogroll is there to show others who else you are reading or find interesting .
A generic blogroll like the Atheist blogroll is something that you are not reading .
You know it , I know it and Technorati knows it .
Why is it irrelevant ?
Because nobody uses the damn thing .
I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I have followed a blogroll link and the same goes for the number of times I ’ve had a link to me from a blogroll .
If people do n’t use them , why do you expect automated ranking to consider them ?
Pretending this is not the case by posting your blogroll at various places and hoping they do n’t notice is just wrong .
If you do want to help other bloggers do it right .
Link through the main article .
A link through the body text counts 100 times as much as a blogroll link .
This in not only because of google algorithms but because there links are used by your readers .
They are useful .
A link through the body text counts 100 times as much as a blogroll link .
This in not only because of google algorithms but because there links are used by your readers .
They are useful .
Link to actual posts .
Linking to the main page of a blog is not very helpful and most people just bounce away .
If you want to do the most good , link to the permalink of a specific article you liked and that others might also enjoy .

Link often .
There ’s not better way to drive traffic to your favorite blogs than by linking to them in your articles .
Point people to insightful posts they make or comment on something they write .
Not only does this improve their authority , but it helps them be discovered .

Not only does this improve their authority , but it helps them be discovered .
Do n’t overdo it .
Linking to 100 different blogs in one month is much more efficient than linking to 300 blogs in one day .
A final word
Before I close this post I want to make sure that I have n’t given you the impression that blogrolls are not useful .
Indeed a short blogroll of someone I like does make me click the links to see what I might discover .
It is the humongous lists of hundreds of links that just make me blank out .
For example , the Atheist Blogroll is at the moment at 760 individual blogs !
This number is pretty much unworkable for humans without extra tools but it does not mean it ’s not useful otherwise .
However boosting the technorati authority is not one of them .
If you have any objections to these points or want have another one to mention , feel free to post them in the comments .

Extra police officers were brought in to control the march
Police have been continuing to question 33 people arrested following protests at a British National Party ( BNP ) festival in Derbyshire .
Arrests were made on Saturday after about 40 demonstrators clashed with riot police outside the BNP 's annual event in Denby .
Further arrests were made the same day as protesters dispersed in Heanor .
About 250 officers , including some armed with batons were deployed , as well as dogs and a force helicopter .
Earlier some 700 demonstrators from Notts Stop the BNP , the TUC and Unison took part in a march from the nearby village of Codnor .
Barricade thwarted
Extra officers were drafted in to control the march as a group of protesters tried to break a police cordon which had been put in place .
They waved placards as they walked down the village high street to the field where the festival was being held .
Assistant Chief Constable Peter Goodman said : " A small number of people who were not part of the main group seemed intent on causing problems .
" I think our actions today have shown that we will not tolerate disorder of any kind in Derbyshire .
" We will be continuing our inquiries to identify and trace those people who committed offences but were not arrested today . "
BNP chairman , Nick Griffin , said : " We regard them [ protesters ] as entitled to have their demonstration .
" It 's unfortunate that some of them want to try and cause trouble for us .
Hence then the police had to inconvenience local people . "
Earlier in the week police in Derbyshire invoked special public order laws to restrict the number of people who planned to demonstrate in protest at the BNP festival .
The Russia - Georgia war threatens one of the world ’s oil arteries
The world ’s oil supply chain depends on a small number of key components , many of which are both vulnerable and in zones of conflict .
This obvious to most of us , except the maniacs urging selling off much of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( to get the money , to temporarily depress oil prices , to hurt speculators — for a number of specious reasons ) .
This week ’s news about the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( BTC ) oil pipeline reminds us why we need a large SPR .
Currently , the pipeline moves almost 850,000 barrels per day and the pipeline is expected to transport 1 million barrels per day ( nearly 50 million tons per year ) later this year ( source ) .
Current world consumption is aprox 85 million b/day .
A section of the pipeline in Turkey exploded on 5 August .
Probably sabotage , probably by Kurdish separatists .
How long until normal operation resume is not yet been announced .
There are alternative routes , but at lower volumes .
The Russia – Georgia fighting could also stop the flow of oil through the BTC ( see Information Dissemination for a good perspective US involvement in these events ) .
In fact , it already has …
“ Azerbaijan halts oil exports via Georgia ports : state oil firm “ , AFP , 9 August 2008 — Due to the fighting , not a specific incident .
Now there are disputed reports that the pipeline has been attacked by the Russians , but not hit .
Since the target is a visible and vulnerable target , perhaps the Russians were sending a signal .
Perhaps to NATO , warning us to stay out .
“ Russian jets targeted major oil pipeline ” , Reuters , 9 Aug 2008
Russian fighter jets targeted the the major Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( BTC ) oil pipeline which carries oil to the West from Asia but missed , Georgia ’s Economic Development Minister Ekaterina Sharashidze said on Saturday .
“ This clearly shows that Russia has not just targeted Georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in Georgia , ” she said at a news briefing .
There have been no independent verifications of Russian jets targeting the BTC pipeline .
Of course , this is just an unconfirmed report from a war zone .

This is an extract from my new book “ Bad Science “ , in the Guardian today .
It ’s out on Monday : my recommendation is that you buy it , and give it to someone who disagrees with you .

Dr Andrew Wakefield is in front of the General Medical Council on charges of serious professional misconduct , his paper on 12 children with autism and bowel problems is described as “ debunked ” – although it never supported the conclusions ascribed to it – and journalists have convinced themselves that his £ 435,643 fee from legal aid proves that his research was flawed .
I will now defend the heretic Dr Andrew Wakefield .
The media are fingering the wrong man , and they know who should really take the blame : in MMR , journalists and editors have constructed their greatest hoax to date , and finally demonstrated that they can pose a serious risk to public health .
But there are also many unexpected twists to learn from : the health journalists themselves were not at fault , the scale of the bias in the coverage was greater than anybody realised at the time , Leo Blair was a bigger player than Wakefield , and it all happened much later than you think .
Before we begin , it ’s worth taking a moment to look at vaccine scares around the world , because I ’m always struck by how circumscribed these panics are .
The MMR and autism scare , for example , is practically non-existent outside Britain .
But throughout the 1990s France was in the grip of a scare that hepatitis B vaccine caused multiple sclerosis .
In the US , the major vaccine fear has been around the use of a preservative called thiomersal , although somehow this has n’t caught on here , even though that same preservative was used in Britain .
In the 1970s there was a widespread concern in the UK , driven again by a single doctor , that whooping - cough vaccine was causing neurological damage .
What the diversity of these anti-vaccination panics helps to illustrate is the way in which they reflect local political and social concerns more than a genuine appraisal of the risk data , because if the vaccine for hepatitis B , or MMR , is dangerous in one country , it should be equally dangerous everywhere ; and if those concerns were genuinely grounded in the evidence , especially in an age of the rapid propagation of information , you would expect the concerns to be expressed by journalists everywhere .
They ’re not .
In 1998 Wakefield published his paper in the Lancet .
It ’s surprising to see , if you go back to the original clippings , that the study and the press conference were actually covered in a fairly metered fashion , and also quite sparsely .
The Guardian and the Independent reported the story on their front pages , but the Sun ignored it entirely , and the Daily Mail – home of the health scare , and now well known as vigorous campaigners against vaccination – buried their first MMR piece unobtrusively in the middle of the paper .
There were only 122 articles mentioning the subject at all , in all publications , that whole year .
This was not unreasonable .
The study itself was fairly trivial , a “ case series report ” of 12 people – essentially a collection of 12 clinical anecdotes – and such a study would only really be interesting and informative if it described a rare possible cause of a rare outcome .
If everyone who went into space came back with an extra finger , say , then that would be worth noting .
For things as common as MMR and autism , finding 12 people with both is entirely unspectacular .
But things were going to get much worse , and for some very interesting reasons .
In 2001 and 2002 the scare began to gain momentum .
Wakefield published a review paper in an obscure journal , questioning the safety of the immunisation programme , although with no new evidence .
He published two papers on laboratory work using PCR ( a technique used in genetic fingerprinting ) which claimed to show measles virus in tissue samples from children with bowel problems and autism .
These received blanket media coverage .
The coverage rapidly began to deteriorate , in ways which now feel familiar and predictable .
Emotive anecdotes from distressed parents were pitted against old men in corduroy with no media training .
The Royal College of General Practitioners press office not only failed to speak clearly on the evidence , it also managed to dig up anti-MMR GPs for journalists who rang in asking for quotes .
Newspapers and celebrities began to use the vaccine as an opportunity to attack the government and the health service , and of course it was the perfect story , with a charismatic maverick fighting against the system , a Galileo - like figure .
There were elements of risk , of awful personal tragedy , and of course , the question of blame : whose fault was autism ?
But the biggest public health disaster of all – which everyone misses – was a sweet little baby called Leo .
In December 2001 the Blairs were asked if their infant son had been given the MMR vaccine , and refused to answer , on the grounds that this would invade their child ’s right to privacy .
This stance was not entirely unreasonable , but its validity was somewhat undermined by Cherie Blair when she chose to reveal Leo ’s vaccination history , in the process of promoting her autobiography , and also described the specific act of sexual intercourse which conceived him .
And while most other politicians were happy to clarify whether their children had had the vaccine , you could see how people might believe the Blairs were the kind of family not to have their children immunised : essentially , they had surrounded themselves with health cranks .
There was Cherie Blair ’s closest friend and aide , Carole Caplin , a new age guru and “ life coach ” .
Cherie was reported to visit Carole ’s mum , Sylvia Caplin , a spiritual guru who was viciously anti-MMR ( “ for a tiny child , the MMR is a ridiculous thing to do .
It has definitely caused autism , ” she told the Mail ) .
They were also prominently associated with a new age healer called Jack Temple , who offered crystal dowsing , homeopathy , neolithic - circle healing in his suburban back garden , and some special breastfeeding technique which he reckoned made vaccines unnecessary .
Whatever you believe about the Blairs ’ relationships , this is what the nation was thinking about when they refused to clarify whether they had given their child the MMR vaccine .
The MMR scare has created a small cottage industry of media analysis .
In 2003 the Economic and Social Research Council published a paper on the media ’s role in the public understanding of science , which sampled all the major science media stories from January to September 2002 , the peak of the scare .
It found 32 % of all the stories written in that period about MMR mentioned Leo Blair , and Wakefield was only mentioned in 25 % : Leo Blair was a bigger figure in this story than Wakefield .
And this was not a passing trivial moment in a 10 - year - long story .
2002 was in fact the peak of the media coverage , by a very long margin .
In 1998 there were only 122 articles on MMR .
In 2002 there were 1,257 ( from here ) .
MMR was the biggest science story that year , the most likely science topic to be written about in opinion or editorial pieces , it produced the longest stories of any science subject , and was also by far the most likely to generate letters to the press , so people were clearly engaging with the issue .
MMR was the biggest and most heavily covered science story for years .
It was also covered extremely badly , and largely by amateurs .
Less than a third of broadsheet reports in 2002 referred to the overwhelming evidence that MMR is safe , and only 11 % mentioned that it is regarded as safe in the 90 other countries in which it is used .
While stories on GM food , or cloning , stood a good chance of being written by specialist science reporters , with stories on MMR their knowledge was deliberately sidelined , and 80 % of the coverage was by generalist reporters .
Suddenly we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from Nigella Lawson , Libby Purves , Suzanne Moore and Carol Vorderman , to name only a few .
The anti-MMR lobby , meanwhile , developed a reputation for targeting generalist journalists , feeding them stories , and actively avoiding health or science correspondents .
Journalists are used to listening with a critical ear to briefings from press officers , politicians , PR executives , salespeople , lobbyists , celebrities and gossip - mongers , and they generally display a healthy natural scepticism : but in the case of science , generalists do n’t have the skills to critically appraise a piece of scientific evidence on its merits .
At best , the evidence of these “ experts ” will only be examined in terms of who they are as people , or perhaps who they have worked for .
In the case of MMR , this meant researchers were simply subjected to elaborate smear campaigns .
The actual scientific content of stories was brushed over and replaced with didactic statements from authority figures on either side of the debate , which contributed to a pervasive sense that scientific advice is somehow arbitrary , and predicated upon a social role – the “ expert ” – rather than on empirical evidence .
Any member of the public would have had very good reason to believe that MMR caused autism , because the media distorted the scientific evidence , reporting selectively on the evidence suggesting that MMR was risky , and repeatedly ignoring the evidence to the contrary .
In the case of the PCR data , the genetic fingerprinting information on whether vaccine - strain measles virus could be found in tissue samples of children with autism and bowel problems , this bias was , until a few months ago , quite simply absolute .
You will remember from earlier that Wakefield co-authored two scientific papers – known as the “ Kawashima paper ” and the “ O’ Leary paper ” – claiming to have found such evidence , and received blanket media coverage for them .
But you may never even have heard of the papers showing these to be probable false positives .
In the Journal of Medical Virology May March 2006 there was a paper by Afzal et al , looking for measles RNA in children with regressive autism after MMR vaccination , using tools so powerful they could detect measles RNA down to single - figure copy numbers .
It found no evidence of the vaccine - strain measles RNA to implicate MMR .
Nobody wrote about this study , anywhere , in the British media ( except for me in my column ) .
This was not an isolated case .
Another major paper was published in the leading academic journal Pediatrics a few months later , replicating the earlier experiments very closely , and in some respects more carefully , also tracing out the possible routes by which a false positive could have occurred .
For this paper by D’Souza et al , like the Afzal paper before it , the media were united in their silence .
It was covered , by my count , in only two places : my column , and a Reuters news agency report .
Nowhere else ( although there was a post on the lead researcher ’s boyfriend ’s blog where he talked about how proud he was of his girlfriend ) .
[ EDITED to disambiguate ]
Journalists like to call for “ more research ” : here it was , and it was ignored .
Did the media neglect to cover these stories because they were bored of the story ?
Clearly not .
Because in 2006 , at exactly the same time as they were unanimously refusing even to mention these studies , they were covering an identical claim , using identical experimental methodology : “ US scientists back autism link to MMR ” said the Telegraph .
“ Scientists fear MMR link to autism ” squealed the Mail .
What was this frightening new data ?
These scare stories were based on a poster presentation , at a conference yet to occur , on research not yet completed , by a man with a well - documented track record of announcing research that never subsequently appears in an academic journal .
This time Dr Arthur Krigsman was claiming he had found genetic material from vaccine - strain measles virus in some gut samples from children with autism and bowel problems .
If true , this would have bolstered Wakefield ’s theory , which by 2006 was lying in tatters .
We might also mention that Wakefield and Krigsman are doctors together at Thoughtful House , a private autism clinic in the US .
Two years after making these claims , the study remains unpublished .
Nobody can read what Krigsman did in his experiment , what he measured , or replicate it .
Should anyone be surprised by this ?
No. Krigsman was claiming in 2002 that he had performed colonoscopy studies on children with autism and found evidence of harm from MMR , to universal jubilation in the media , and this work remains entirely unpublished as well .
Until we can see exactly what he did , we ca n’t see whether there may be flaws in his methods , as there are in all scientific papers , to a greater or lesser extent : maybe he did n’t select the subjects properly , maybe he measured the wrong things .
If he does n’t write it up formally , we can never know , because that is what scientists do : write papers , and pull them apart to see if their findings are robust .
Through reporting as shamelessly biased as this , British journalists have done their job extremely well .
People make health decisions based on what they read in the newspapers , and MMR uptake has plummeted from 92 % to 73 % : there can be no doubt that the appalling state of health reporting is now a serious public health issue .
We have already seen a mumps epidemic in 2005 , and measles cases are at their highest levels for a decade .
But these are not the most chilling consequences of their hoax , because the media are now queueing up to blame one man , Wakefield , for their own crimes .
It is madness to imagine that one single man can create a 10 - year scare story .
It is also dangerous to imply – even in passing – that academics should be policed not to speak their minds , no matter how poorly evidenced their claims .
Individuals like Wakefield must be free to have bad ideas .
The media created the MMR hoax , and they maintained it diligently for 10 years .
Their failure to recognise that fact demonstrates that they have learned nothing , and until they do , journalists and editors will continue to perpetrate the very same crimes , repeatedly , with increasingly grave consequences .

Wheel scary : Chinese anti-terror police practise killing drills on scooters
Chinese elite anti-terror police officers are wheeling into action ahead of next month 's Beijing Olympics on two - wheeled scooters .
Members of the country 's armed police unit practised on the Segway models that have been re-named ' Anti - Terror Assault Vehicles ' in the eastern province of Shandong .
Killers : Despite the strange appearance of the scooters , the Chinese ant - terror police are lethal in action
Officials have bought 100 Segways and painted some in military camouflage to patrol airports and sporting venues during the Games .
In one drill , police posing as terrorists held ten badminton audience members hostage , ' shooting dead ' four ' hijackers ' , capturing two and defusing a mock car bomb .
The exercise was to test the province 's emergency response and involved 1,500 people .
The Segway was the brainchild of American Dean Kamen , who claimed at its 2001 launch that it would make the car obsolete in congested cities .
It has since been the object of some derision , however .
The two - wheeled self - balancing machine - powered by an electric motor - allows users to travel as fast as 12.5 mph while standing up .

BAGHDAD , July 19 ( UPI ) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki was " mistranslated " in a report that he favors Barack Obama 's plan to withdraw U.S. troops , an Iraqi spokesman said .
Der Spiegel reported Saturday that Maliki , in an interview with the German news magazine , said U.S. troops should leave Iraq " as soon as possible , as far as we are concerned . "

" U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months , " Maliki said .
" That , we think , would be the right time frame for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes . "
Maliki stressed that he was not endorsing Obama , the likely Democratic presidential nominee .
A spokesman for Maliki issued a statement saying the comments were " misunderstood and mistranslated , " The New York Times reported .
The statement did not specify how Maliki 's remarks had been mistranslated , the newspaper said .
The Obama campaign issued a statement by campaign foreign policy adviser Susan Rice saying the Democratic senator from Illinois " welcomes … Maliki 's support for a 16 month time line for the redeployment of U.S combat brigades . "
Randy Scheunemann , foreign policy director for the campaign of likely Republican nominee John McCain , issued a statement saying Maliki affirmed the Arizona senator 's position that " withdrawal must be based on conditions on the ground . "
" The difference between John McCain and Barack Obama is that Barack Obama advocates an unconditional withdrawal that ignores the facts on the ground and the advice of our top military commanders , " he said .
Modern poets tend to avoid the epic style poetry of the past – but there can be no doubt that many of them were influenced greatly by these poems .
This is a selection of the most well known epic poems from before the 20th century .
While it is tempting to add the likes of Howl by Ginsberg and modernize the list , it would mean removing at least one of the great epics listed here – so 20th century poetry will be left for another list .
10 Aeneid Virgil
The Aeneid is a Latin epic poem written by Virgil in the 1st century BC ( between 29 and 19 BC ) that tells the legendary story of Aeneas , a Trojan who traveled to Italy , where he became the ancestor of the Romans .
It is written in dactylic hexameter ( considered to be the Grand Style of classical poetry ) .
The first six of the poem ’s twelve books tell the story of Aeneas ’ wanderings from Troy to Italy , and the poem ’s second half treats the Trojans ’ ultimately victorious war upon the Latins , under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed .
9 Don Juan Lord Byron
This is a long , digressive satiric poem , based on the legend of Don Juan , which Byron reverses , portraying Juan not as a womaniser but someone easily seduced by women .
It is a variation on the epic form .
Unlike the more tortured early romantic works by Byron , exemplified by Childe Harold ’s Pilgrimage , Don Juan has a more humorous , satirical bent .
Modern critics generally consider it to be Byron ’s masterpiece .
The poem was not finished by his death in 1824 .
Byron managed to complete 16 cantos leaving an unfinished 17th canto before his death .
Byron claims that he had no ideas in his mind as to what would happen in subsequent cantos as he wrote his work .
When the first two cantos were published anonymously in 1819 , the poem was criticised for its “ immoral content , ” though it was also immensely popular .
8 Paradise Lost John Milton
This is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th - century English poet John Milton .
It was originally published in 1667 in ten books ; a second edition followed in 1674 , redivided into twelve books ( in the manner of the division of Virgil ’s Aeneid ) with minor revisions throughout and a note on the versification .
The poem concerns the Judeo - Christian story of the Fall of Man : the temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden .
Milton ’s purpose , stated in Book I , is “ justify the ways of God to men ” ( Milton 1674 , 4:26 ) and elucidate the conflict between God ’s eternal foresight and free will .
Milton incorporates Paganism , classical Greek references and Christianity within the story .
The poem grapples with many difficult theological issues , including fate , predestination and the Trinity .
7 The Divine Comedy Dante Alighieri
This is widely considered the central epic poem of Italian literature and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature .
The poem ’s imaginative and allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife is a culmination of the medieval world - view as it had developed in the Western Church .
The poem is written in the first person , and tells of Dante ’s journey through the three realms of the dead , lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300 .
The Roman poet Virgil guides him through Hell and Purgatory ; Beatrice , Dante ’s ideal woman , guides him through Heaven .
6 Mah?bh?rata Vyasa
With more than 74,000 verses , long prose passages , and about 1.8 million words in total , the Mah ? bh? rata is one of the longest epic poems in the world .
Including the HarivaM ’sa the Mahabharata has a total length of more than 90,000 verses .
It is of immense importance to the culture of the Indian subcontinent and is a major text of Hinduism .
Its discussion of human goals ( artha or purpose , kama or pleasure , dharma or duty and moksha or liberation ) takes place in a long - standing tradition , attempting to explain the relationship of the individual to society and the world ( the nature of the ‘ Self ’ ) and the workings of karma .
5 Beowulf Anonymous
This is an Old English language heroic epic poem of anonymous authorship , dating as recorded in the Nowell Codex manuscript from between the 8th to the 11th century and relates events described as having occurred in what is now Denmark and Sweden .
Commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo - Saxon Literature , Beowulf has been the subject of much scholarly study , theory , speculation , discourse and , at 3183 lines , it has been noted for its length .
In the poem , Beowulf , a hero of the Geats , battles three antagonists : Grendel , who has been attacking the mead hall in Denmark called Heorot and its inhabitants ; Grendel ’s mother and , later in life after returning to Geatland ( modern southern Sweden ) and becoming a king , he fights an unnamed dragon .
Beowulf is fatally wounded in the final battle , and after his death he is buried in a barrow in Geatland by his retainers .
4 Metamorphoses Ovid
This is a narrative poem in fifteen books that describes the creation and history of the world .
Completed in 8 AD , it has remained one of the most popular works of mythology , being the classical work best known to medieval writers and thus having a great deal of influence on medieval poetry .
3 The Odyssey Homer
This is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer .
The poem was probably written near the end of the eighth century BC , somewhere along the Greek - controlled western Turkey seaside Ionia .
The poem is , in part , a sequel to Homer ’s Iliad and mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus and his long journey home to Ithaca following the fall of Troy .
It takes Odysseus ten years to reach his kingdom of Ithica after the ten - year Trojan War .
During this absence , his son Telemachus and wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors , called Proci , to compete for Penelope ’s hand in marriage , since most have assumed that Odysseus has died .
2 Epic of Gilgamesh Anonymous
This is an epic poem from Ancient Mesopotamia and is among the earliest known works of literary fiction .
Scholars surmise that a series of Sumerian legends and poems about the mythological hero - king Gilgamesh , who might have been a real ruler in the late Early Dynastic II period ( ca. 27th century BCE ) , were gathered into a longer Akkadian poem long afterward , with the most complete version existing today preserved on twelve clay tablets in the library collection of the 7th century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal .
The essential story revolves around the relationship between Gilgamesh , a king who has become distracted and disheartened by his rule , and a friend , Enkidu , who is half - wild and who undertakes dangerous quests with Gilgamesh .
Much of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh ’s thoughts of loss following Enkidu ’s death .
It is about their becoming human together , and has a high emphasis on immortality .
A large portion of the book shows Gilgamesh ’s search for immortality after Enkidu ’s death .
It is often credited by historians as being one of the first literary works .
The epic is widely read in translation , and the hero , Gilgamesh , has become an icon of popular culture .
1 The Iliad Homer
This , together with the Odyssey , is one of two ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer .
The poem is commonly dated to the late 9th or to the 8th century BC and many scholars believe it is the oldest extant work of literature in the ancient Greek language , making it the first work of European literature .
The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of Ilion or Troy , by the Greeks .

In its timing , authorship and style of reporting , the book is strikingly reminiscent of the one Mr. Corsi wrote with John O’Neill about Mr. Kerry , “ Unfit for Command , ” which included various accusations that were ultimately undermined by news reports pointing out the contradictions .
( Some critics of Mr. Kerry quoted in the book had earlier praised his bravery in incidents they were now asserting he had fabricated ; one had earned a medal for bravery in a gun battle he accused Mr. Kerry of concocting . )
But books like “ Unfit for Command , ” which remained for some 12 weeks on the Times best - seller list , and , now , “ The Obama Nation , ” have become an effective and favored delivery system for political attacks .
There have been anti-Clinton ( both Bill and Hillary ) and anti-Bush books too numerous to name .
The sensational findings in these books , true or dubious , can quickly come to dominate the larger political discussion in the news media , especially on cable television and the less readily detectible confines of talk radio and partisan Web sites .
Fact - checking the books can require extensive labor and time from independent journalists , whose work often trails behind the media echo chamber .
Web sites on the left have begun poring over Mr. Corsi ’s latest book .
Media Matters , which is run by David Brock , a former right - wing journalist who wrote a classic of the attack genre , “ The Real Anita Hill , ” has been particularly aggressive in fact - checking the book , and its press releases on inaccuracies in the book have gotten some attention on cable television .
Several of the book ’s accusations , in fact , are unsubstantiated , misleading or inaccurate .
For instance , Mr. Corsi writes that Mr. Obama had “ yet to answer ” whether he “ stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college , or whether his drug usage extended to his law school days or beyond . ”
“ How about in the U.S. Senate ? ” Mr. Corsi asks .
But Mr. Obama , who admitted to occasional marijuana and cocaine use in his high school and early college years , wrote in his memoir that he had “ stopped getting high ” when he moved to New York in the early 1980s .
And in 2003 The State Journal - Register of Springfield , Ill. , quoted him responding to a question of his drug use by saying , “ I have n’t done anything since I was 20 years old . ”
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
After 58 years , historians and journalists will have a chance to examine the secret grand jury testimony of witnesses in the espionage case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg .
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg in 1953 in a New York police van shortly before their execution for spying .
The couple was investigated in 1950 , tried in 1951 for conspiracy to commit espionage and convicted and sentenced to death in 1953 .
Cold War scholars are hoping the grand jury transcripts will shed light on some nagging questions about the case -- primarily , just how strong the case was against Ethel Rosenberg .
The National Security Archive , the American Historical Association , the Georgetown University Law Center and others have petitioned to have the transcripts of 46 witnesses released to the public .
In an unusual move , federal authorities have said that because of the historic significance of the case , they do not oppose releasing the transcripts of testimony from witnesses who have died or who do not object to their release .
Of the 46 grand jury witnesses , 36 are either deceased or do not object to releasing the transcripts .
Three others are thought to have died ; four have not been located .
In a partial ruling Tuesday , U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied a request to release the testimony of three other witnesses , including one of the most controversial -- David Greenglass , Ethel Rosenberg 's brother and a pivotal witness who testified against the couple .
Do n't Miss Witness in Cold War spy case dies
Greenglass ' attorney sent Hellerstein two letters asking that his testimony not be released .
He offered to provide information to support that request , but stipulated that that information be sealed .
" The circumstances that led to the testimony of Mr. Greenglass before the grand jury in 1950 were complex and emotionally wrought , " his attorney wrote in one letter to the judge .
" Mr. Greenglass and his family were thrust into an ... unwanted spotlight which has dogged their lives ever since , " the other letter said .
In the 1940s , Greenglass was an Army sergeant working at the Manhattan Project , the atomic bomb project , in Los Alamos , New Mexico .
He eventually confessed to being a spy recruited by Julius Rosenberg and agreed to testify against the couple at trial .
Greenglass ' wife , Ruth , had also been under investigation and was threatened with indictment .
Ruth Greenglass , who died earlier this year at age 84 , told investigators she had seen Ethel Rosenberg type up her brother 's notes .
At the trial , Greenglass confirmed his wife 's account .
Before that testimony , however , the case against Ethel Rosenberg was considered much weaker than that against her husband .
According to New York Times reporter Sam Roberts , who interviewed Greenglass for his book , " The Brother : The Untold Story of the Rosenberg Case , " Greenglass said he lied on the stand in the case and in fact did not clearly remember whether it was Ethel or his wife who had typed his notes .
David Vladeck , representing the petitioners , argued for the release of Greenglass ' grand jury testimony , saying the witness had compromised himself by discussing the case in the Roberts book and on the CBS news program " 60 Minutes . "
Vladeck said Greenglass has told others he was pushed by the government to change his story before testifying .
" He points an accusing finger at the U.S. attorney 's office and said the government pressured him to lie , " Vladeck said .
Hellerstein rejected that argument .
" He may be a scoundrel , he may be a liar , " the judge said , but the facts " do n't override my judgment on the value of grand jury secrecy . "
Although he sided with the government on the Greenglass matter , Hellerstein urged officials to locate the remaining witnesses to obtain consent for releasing the documents .
" Time is precious to those who research , " he said .
" The public interest is best satisfied by the prompt and proper release of information . "
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McNeela said the government was not arguing that the transcripts never be disclosed , but that they " should not be disclosed at this time . "
Hellerstein instructed McNeela to report back to court on August 26 after making a last push to find the remaining witnesses .
One former defendant in a related case , Miriam Moskowitz , is opposed to having her grand jury testimony disclosed , and Hellerstein therefore denied the petitioners ' request to release it .
Moskowitz was convicted in 1950 of conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly helping her business partner , Abe Brothman , deceive the grand jury .
Now 92 , she expressed relief that the transcripts would not make it into the hands of the Cold War historians , " because I know they will not write the truth . "
All About Espionage and Intelligence
In 1971 Erin Pizzey founded Chiswick Women 's Aid , the first refuge for battered wives .
Her 1974 book " Scream Quietly or the Neighbors Will Hear " brought the issue to the attention of the public .
About Erin Pizzey | Articles by Erin Pizzey
Written by Erin Pizzey Friday , April 13 , 2007 5:49 AM
I have been putting together my research for a book detailing the birth of the first refuge in the world opened in Chiswick , London in 1971 and the rise of the feminist movement in the Western world .
For this purpose I am going to write bout my first trips to America when I was invited on March 12 , 1977 to begin a tour to talk about domestic violence and also to help with the opening of Shelters - as they were called in America .
Soon after I opened my refuge I tried to find information on the subject of domestic violence .
There was none .
Very little was known about battered children and those discussions were largely confined to medical journals .
What went on behind the front door remained there and I was aware as a child immured behind my parents front door and exposed to both their violent and dysfunctional behavior that the subject of family violence was a deep and shameful secret .
Certainly the myth that only the poor , disenfranchised and inarticulate men battered their wives was expounded by the many caring agencies that were supposed to be caring for these families .
It was explained to me very early on by a social worker that ; ‘he beats her because he loves her and she only recognises his love for her if he hits her . ’
This patronising attitude existed because in the sixties and seventies the whole concept of social work was largely practised by middle class women with middle class attitudes .
Social work was in its infancy and there was a huge divide between the ‘ deserving poor ’ and what was then called ‘ dustbin families . ’
I knew that this was a huge fallacy because my father worked for the British Foreign Office .
We lived in big houses with plenty of servants but both my parents screamed , yelled and fought all across the world .
My mother had private money and could have gone back to her family in Canada but she preferred to maintain her appalling relationship with my father and the two of them ruined our childhood .
My other experience was also that for many years we were left in boarding schools in England .
There some of the girls whispered the stories of their sufferings at home .
In those days some fifty years ago loyalty to your family was absolutely sacred which is why domestic violence probably remained a silent scream for so long .
I particularly remember one girl whose mother shot her father and another case where a girl told some of us that she had been raped by her father and she was expelled by the nuns - silence was enforced .
So I realised that with no literature that I could find on the subject and no where to turn , I had to sit down and try and put a book together in order to get the subject out in the open and to help create other refuges across England .
Scream Quietly or the Neighbors Will Hear was published in 1974 , but only after a fight with the Managing Director of the publishing house who demanded that I blame capitalism for wife beating , while I insisted that wife beating was as prevalent in his beloved Russia as it was here .
Much to his fury , the book was taken up by The Daily Express Newspaper and overnight the whole subject of domestic violence became national news .
I was aware that the feminist movement were going to wage war against my refuge .
From the beginning I employed men and women to work with the mothers and the children .
We also had staff who were willing to see any of the men who wanted our help .
From the very beginning we had women coming into the refuge who were just as violent as the men they left and they were violent towards their children .
We saw these women as most in need of our help .
All this ran in direct contradiction of the feminists who insisted that all domestic violence was perpetrated by men .
Other countries were taking copies of Scream Quietly Or the Neighbours Will Hear and photocopying the book in order to open refuges in their own countries .
I was in negotiations with American publishers over the possibility of publishing Scream Quietly when I became aware that the book was likely to be politicised and naively I thought that by my cancelling the publication , I could at least protect one source of information from being hi-jacked by the feminist movement .
I knew by now , that none of the women in this movement had any interest in the subject of family violence .
For the leaders of this new political movement the subject of family violence was merely a high road to funding for their cause - the destruction of the family and of men .
In 1977 Del Martin , a lesbian activist in California , wrote her book Battered Women , and of course she lifted a huge amount of Scream Quietly to bolster her argument that domestic violence was a direct result of marriage .
At that time , the lesbian movement within the women ’s movements across the world were the most highly organised and vociferous leaders .
Heterosexual women were considered traitors to the cause and were guilty of ’ sleeping with the enemy . ’
I lasted but a few months within the women ’s movement in England before I was booted out .
Even then I tried to point out that lesbian women were coming to my refuge beaten up by their partners , but I was ignored .
My first tour included a meeting with Professor Murray Straus of the University of New Hampshire , and then next on this extensive tour would be a meeting with Gloria Steinem and lunch at Ms. Magazine .
I was already in Ms. Steinem ’s bad books because we made film which was to be shown on PBS and she had insisted in fronting it .
I was nervous because , yet again , I knew she would use it to batter men , and I was desperate to get the message across that domestic violence was not a gender issue .
She threatened that if she was not allowed to front the film , PBS would not show it .
I capitulated .
Any refuge was better than none .
And that was my dilemma in those early days when even to get a refuge open in many countries was a huge enterprise .

Researchers have discovered that a drug marketed to slow the progression of memory loss in Alzheimer 's disease may also prevent brain damage in as many as 35 percent of premature infants .
Scientists at Children 's Hospital Boston in a study published in The Journal of Neuroscience say they used memantine ( brand name Namenda ) to stop strokes ‚Äîthat would result in learning difficulties , behavioral problems and faulty motor function ‚Äîin rats .
The researchers hope to receive permission sometime in the next five years to test their new treatment in premature babies who suffer strokes .
Thanks to medical and technological strides , children as young as 23 weeks old ( average pregnancy is about 40 weeks ) are now able to survive , according to study co-author and neurologist Frances Jensen .
But infants this young have less oxygen in their blood ‚Äîbecause their lungs are not fully functional and their breathing is labored ‚Äîleaving them prone to strokes ( caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain ) .
Preemies " are a very very fragile group of patients , " Jensen says , adding that the strokes are the main cause of cerebral palsy ‚Äîan incurable neurological disorder that affects the motor function of 500,000 people in the U.S. , with 8,000 infants diagnosed yearly .
When nerve cells ( neurons ) do not get enough oxygen , they cannot make enough energy to function properly .
As a result a neurotransmitter called glutamate , which revs up the cells to fire ( send electrical signals between one another ) , builds up between brain cells .
Normally , the neurons transport the glutamate across their membranes , thereby removing the prompt to fire .
But without oxygen , their energy is depleted and they are powerless to remove it .
Eventually , this buildup causes them to overactivate , leading to cell death and stroke .
Researchers found that memantine blocks a glutamate - sensing protein on a brain cell 's surface so it will not activate even in the neurotransmitter 's presence .
In premature babies , this protein is only found on a type of brain cell called an oligodendrocyte , which makes a fatty coating that insulates the parts of nerve cells that transmit electrical signals to neighboring cells .
Without the coating , called myelin , neuronal communication is disrupted , causing cognitive deficits and motion - related illnesses , as in cerebral palsy .
Jensen and her colleagues temporarily blocked blood flow to one side of the brain in rats to cut off the oxygen supply .
( The other side of the brain was left alone so the researchers could directly evaluate the effect of their treatment . )
The scientists then gave the injured animals four doses each of memantine over the next 48 hours .
The premature rats that received memantine were protected from a great amount of premature cell death that oxygen depravation should have caused .
The animals that did not receive treatment , however , suffered from strokes .
The injury also affected the development of the animals ' cortices ( the brain 's central processing unit ) ; untreated animals had smaller cortices on the stroke - damaged sides of their brains .
" We were able to protect against the injury and consequences of the injury , " Jensen says .
Researchers , she adds , plan to do more safety studies and , if all goes well , hope to test the drug at Children 's Hospital on premature babies that suffer strokes .
Memantine costs around $ 120 to $ 150 per month for a prescription ( without insurance ) , according to Martin Farlow , a neurologist at the Indiana University ‚ÄìPurdue University at Indianapolis School of Medicine .
Potential side effects are generally mild and include dizziness , constipation , increased blood pressure and headache .
" It 's certainly not a cure for anything [ related to Alzheimer 's ] , " says Farlow .
" But , it has modest efficacy in patients with modest to severe Alzheimer 's , improving cognitive functioning and functioning activities of daily living and behavior . "

We are sitting here this morning , in our office , looking at a fat woman — stark naked — sleeping on a couch .
Of course , how rich people spend their money has always been a source of interest and entertainment .
That an apparently sane and sensible man like Roman Abramovich spent $ 33,641,000 for the painting of the " Benefits Supervisor Sleeping , " must also be a comfort to the poor .
At least , they do n’t have to look at it .
But the world of money is a world of wonder … today , as everyday .
We could begin today ’s reckoning wondering why the rich are so eager to part with their money , for example …or why the poor are so eager to have it ; they can see that it clearly impairs one ’s judgment and degrades one ’s tastes .
Instead , we will wonder why those who constantly praise the virtues of capitalism seem to have so little faith in it .
What brings this wonder to mind is the latest legislation to clear the Senate Finance Committee .
Congress is preparing to improve the way capitalism functions , by authorizing the Federal Housing Administration ( itself an improvement of an earlier Congress ) to insure $ 300 billion worth of home mortgages .
Up until now , federal housing agencies could work all sorts of mischief ; you could argue that without the implicit guarantees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , or the explicit efforts of these quasi-public companies to create a huge market for derivatives based on mortgage finance , the whole housing bubble would never have occurred in the first place .
Now — if this legislation becomes law , that is — new mischief is about to appear on the scene .
The FHA will be empowered to help patch up America ’s housing bubble .
The goal , said Senator Chris Dodd , is to keep people in their homes .
He did not mention that these are the same homes whose owners demonstrably cannot afford them .
Nor was he especially concerned that his meddling with the corrective machinery of capitalism was likely to throw a monkey wrench into the gears .
Instead , like God on the 6th day of creation , he looked upon his handiwork and thought it was pretty good .
Everyone is perfectly happy to let capitalism do its stuff — as long as they like the results .
But cometh a correction and all of a sudden the press is full of whining pundits and meddling politicians .
Every correction brings forth new improvements until there are so many of them the system collapses under the weight .
That why we have revolutions and bankruptcies , after all , to blow away the accumulated impediments .
And that is why the emerging markets have such an advantage .
In many ways , people swing their arms and their hammers more freely in , say , Russia or China than they do in the United States of America or Britain — simply because there is nothing to stop them .
These countries have already had their moments of violent desperation … their bankruptcies … and their revolutions .
Both tossed out their entire economic systems in the late ’ 80s and early ’90s .
They ’ve been rebuilding — fast — ever since .
The leeches have n’t had a chance to get their suckers attached .
America ’s war against Iraq had its roots in many improving impulses .
According to John McCain and Alan Greenspan , however , the taproot sank into Iraq ’s oil fields ; America wanted to secure its access to cheap oil , they say .
Unfortunately , this program — like all government meddling — backfired .
The price of oil was only $ 25 a barrel when the war began in September of 2003 .
Yesterday , it hit $ 130 a barrel .
And the war itself is expected to cost the nation $ 1 trillion or more .
For all its efforts , the United States secured the most expensive energy in world history .
( And then pushed food prices up to their highest levels in modern times too — keep reading … )
China , meanwhile , decided to take the capitalist road .
Instead , of using military force to get oil , it simply bought it on the open market .
It has sent its agents to secure , peacefully and honestly , long - term contracts for oil and the other natural resources it needs to feed its ravenous economy .
Its buying is driving up prices for everything .
But what would you expect ?
Meanwhile , having completely failed in the Mideast , America ’s improvers turned to the Midwest .
Yes , dear reader , if we ca n’t get oil from the sands of the Gulf and Mesopotamia , we will squeeze it out of our own farmland .
At least , that was the promise of the program to subsidize the production of ethanol .
Capitalism could not be relied upon to fill America ’s energy needs , said the kibitzers .
Capitalism had already pronounced its verdict on corn- based fuel : it was a bad idea .
Later , environmentalists came to the same conclusion ; it actually caused more damage than petroleum .
But the U.S. Congress , in its majestic wisdom , saw something in ethanol that capitalists and environmentalists had missed — campaign contributions and votes !
And so it came to be that a large portion of the U.S. corn crop is diverted into fuel tanks .
And so it comes to be that a large number of the world ’s people — including Americans themselves — find their food much more expensive than it used to be .
u2022 In Haiti , people are eating mud .
We ’re not making this up .
There ’s a photo of a miserable woman making mud cakes in Port - au - Prince , in yesterday ’s Daily Telegraph newspaper .
For the benefit of readers who wish to cut their food budgets , the Telegraph gives us the recipe : you simply mix clay with salt and vegetable fat and lay it out in the sun to cook — like mud pies .
Then , you call them " biscuits . "
Last time we looked , mud was not one of the main food groups recommended by dieticians .
But all over the world , poor people have to make do with what they can find .
Rice is the staple food in Haiti , and it ’s trebled in price in the last year , says the Telegraph .
Other grains are not far behind .
Since January of 2007 , wheat has gone up 200 % and corn 150 % .
Desperate poor have already rioted in 34 countries this year .
The ghost of Thomas Malthus , if he bothers to read the paper , must be saying , " I told you so . "
Malthus predicted that population would grow faster than food supplies .
Millions of people would starve , he predicted .
Now , it looks like he might have been too optimistic .
He died in 1834 .
Since then , a series of happy events and technological developments greatly increased the supply of food … while war and family planning reduced the number of mouths to be fed .
Now , it appears that the gains from mechanization , bioengineering , chemistry and land clearing may have reached their limits .
We may soon reach " Peak Food " … the point at which the world can produce no more food .
But the human population — especially the part of it that does n’t eat at the Tour d’Argent in Paris — keeps growing .
Experts predict that the world ’s population will grow by 3 billion people over the next 40 years — a 50 % increase .
Where will the world get 50 % more food ?
At what price ?
Who knows … but one thing is sure : there will be plenty of opportunities for the world - improvers to make things worse .
u2022 Proving us right before we even made our argument , last week , the U.S. Senate approved the latest farm bill by the largest margin since 1973 .
The bill got widespread , bi-partisan collusion for the very reason that dooms the U.S. economy — it stifles capitalism .
There is something in the farm bill for almost every scoundrel and bounder in the country .
Poor people get more free food .
Rich people get more subsidies .
There was talk of restricting the payouts to people with incomes of $ 200,000 or less … but in the end , the legislation allows people with incomes up to $ 1.25 million to feed at the public trough .
The total cost of the bill is $ 307 billion over five years — with free money to grain farmers , dairymen , fruit growers , school lunch programs , food stamps , land conservation , rural development , and every other special interest whose lobbyists could suborn and pervert the lawmaking process .
There are said to be twice as many lobbyists in Washington than there were 5 years ago ; the trough has been extended proportionately .
Did anyone … anywhere …mention that capitalism could be relied upon to sort out the agricultural sector ?
Did anyone recall that a free market — with prices set by willing producers and consumers — works more efficiently than one that is rigged by lawmakers ?
Did anyone even notice that the farming industry has been corrupted by government money …or ask where the money would come from to corrupt it even more ?
Apparently not .
Apparently , Americans do n’t think they can trust free enterprise to feed them .
They think every bid needs to be checked with a bureaucrat and every ask should be cleared by a Senate committee .
But that ’s where we are , dear reader , circa 2008 … in the greatest show on earth .
At every interval the clowns rush in .
Which takes us back to where we began — looking at the naked fat lady on the couch .

YouTorrent is without a doubt the most talked about newcomer in the BitTorrent scene this year .
The site initially indexed all the popular torrent sites , but switched to purely ' verified ' torrents after receiving legal threats .
Today , YouTorrent officially relaunches with 67,170 " legal " torrents , good for 6 TBs of data .
When we first wrote about YouTorrent , we never expected the site to grow in popularity as quickly as it did .
A month after its launch the site was getting millions of visitors , and it continued to grow .
In fact , no BitTorrent site had ever grown as fast as YouTorrent .
Unfortunately this astronomical growth did n’t last .
In April the meta - search engine stopped indexing sites like The Pirate Bay , isoHunt , and other sources that provide links to unauthorized copyrighted files .
They even considered selling the site at the time , but this never went though .
Unsurprisingly , this change cost the site most of its visitors , who moved on to YouTorrent alternatives .
After a while however , the traffic stabilized , and a few weeks later it started to grow again .
Today , four months after this drastic change , YouTorrent is ready to move on , as it launches the largest legal torrent search engine with tens of thousands of torrents adding up to a whopping 6TB of data .
“ We feel that a full meta - search engine is a better experience for our users considering our switch to legal content , ” Patrick , the co-founder of YouTorrent said .
“ We now return accurate seed and peer data and results are quick and easy to navigate , and more in line with traditional search engine result pages . ”
The new site searches verified torrents on sites such as Jamendo , Vuze , BitTorrent , Legaltorrents , Legittorrents , Gameupdates , Wortharchiving , BT.etree and Mininova ’s featured torrents section .
By default the results are ordered by relevance , but they can also be sorted by number of seeds and peers , the size of the torrent , the upload dates and the number of total downloads so far .
For music files , YouTorrent has also included a link to the Bitlet streaming tool , so users can preview tracks before they decide whether or not they want to download them .
Similar to the old design , there is a list of related searches in the sidebar , which may serve as inspiration .
The YouTorrent blog has been updated , and has some great content as well .
Patrick further told us that they are currently working on a content distribution platform .
This will allow individual publishers to upload files to the site , and YouTorrent will make sure that the files are seeded .
The content distribution platform will be similar to Mininova ’s CD , but Patrick assured us that it will include some great features that are unique to YouTorrent .
“ Although we have lost some traffic we are still very popular and serving hundreds of thousands of searches a day , ” Patrick said .
“ This is very encouraging and we believe with the new service this will continue to grow as our content aggregation reach and depth increases . ”
Going legal has cost the site more than half of its traffic .
The new interface and several other updates are aiming to get at least some of these visitors back , and make the site one of the big players in the “ legal ” torrent niche .
Time will tell if they have made the right decision .
YouTorrent ’s New Look
Chemical promotes cancer development in fish
The experiments were fishy .
But they appear to have uncovered something that rodent studies missed : a potential cancer risk posed by a compound used to manufacture nonstick coatings .
By mimicking the action of estrogen , this chemical , perfluorooctanoic acid , can promote cancer development , researchers report in an upcoming Environmental Health Perspectives .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Better known as PFOA , perfluorooctanoic acid is the nonstick agent that DuPont developed and used to launch its
Teflon line of products more than 50 years ago .
PFOA - based nonstick chemicals now appear in everything from carpets and fry pans to microwave popcorn bags .
Studies performed in the early 1990s showed that PFOA could induce liver tumors in rats .
The mechanism by which it did this , though - a proliferation of subcellular features known as peroxisomes - is n't applicable in humans .
This led many toxicologists to generally close the book on PFOA as a potential carcinogen .
" But our data indicate the book is not closed , " says Abby D. Benninghoff of Oregon State University in Corvallis .
Working with juvenile rainbow trout , her team has just shown that in animals given a carcinogen , PFOA can double the cancer incidence .
Treating carcinogen - exposed fish with estrogen does the same thing .
Additional tests further linked PFOA 's estrogenic alter ego to its cancer - fostering role .
The new paper " shows that PFOA can promote liver tumors in a fish model that has been used as a human model for two decades , " says John A. McLachlan , director of the Tulane / Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research in New Orleans .
Some liver cancers in people have also been linked to estrogen - like drugs .
McLachlan points out that three years ago the International Agency for Research on Cancer linked liver - cancer risk to such estrogenic agents as birth control pills and post - menopausal synthetic estrogens .
In humans , estrogens have been linked most strongly with risk of reproductive - system tumors .
Rodent studies have linked PFOA with tumors in those tissues as well , notes Kristina Thayer of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , in Research Triangle Park , N.C. Considering the spectrum of tumors associated with PFOA in rodents , she says some scientists suspected that one mechanism could n't explain it all .
The Oregon State study now " helps confirm that there 's more going on than just peroxisome proliferation . "
Benninghoff 's team worked with trout because " like humans , they do n't respond to chemicals that cause peroxisome proliferation . "
The researchers exposed 10 - week - old fish to aflatoxin , a fungal poison , for 30 minutes .
Some fish were then exposed chronically for the next 30 weeks to PFOA at any of several doses .
Between 10 and 30 percent of the fish exposed only to the aflatoxin eventually developed a liver tumor or two .
In contrast , 60 to 70 percent of the animals that also got high doses of PFOA developed liver cancer .
PFOA - treated fish sometimes ended up with six or more tumors .
Meanwhile , PFOA caused no tumors in the absence of pretreatment with aflatoxin .
Eight major companies make PFOA .
Concerned by the emerging evidence of the chemical 's toxicity , the Environmental Protection Agency got those manufacturers to agree two years ago to phase down their production of PFOA and related compounds by 95 percent by 2010 .
The attack is believed to be one of the worst in Xinjiang Sixteen Chinese policemen have been killed in an attack on a border post in the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang , state media say .
Two attackers reportedly drove up to the post in a rubbish truck and threw two grenades , before moving in to attack the policemen with knives .
The attack came four days before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games .
Both attackers were captured during the raid near the city of Kashgar , Xinhua state news agency reported .
Kashgar , known as Kashi in Chinese , is some 2,500 miles ( 4,000 km ) from Beijing , near the border with Tajikistan .
Xinhua said the attack happened at about 0800 ( 0000 GMT ) , as the policemen were jogging outside the compound .
Although the episode happened a long way away from Beijing , the very fact that it happened , and the fact that it happened this week , will make the organisers of the Beijing Olympics nervous , says the BBC's James Reynolds in Xinjiang .
Uighur suppression Fourteen policemen died at the scene of the attack and two on the way to hospital .
Another 16 policemen were hurt .
How big is the Xinjiang threat ?
Q&A : China 's Uighur problem
One of the attackers was reported to have been injured in the leg .
Xinjiang , in the north - west of the country , is home to the Muslim Uighur people .
Uighur separatists have waged a low - level campaign against Chinese rule for decades .
Human rights groups say Beijing is suppressing the rights of Uighurs .
China has spoken in the past of what it calls a terrorist threat from Muslim militants in Xinjiang , but it has provided little evidence to back up its claims , says the BBC's Daniel Griffiths in Beijing .
A spokesman for the Beijing Games Organising Committee told Xinhua he was confident that Olympic participants and spectators would be safe .
" China has focused on strengthening security and protection around Olympic venues and at the Olympics Village , so Beijing is already prepared to respond to any threat , " Sun Weide was quoted as saying .
Warnings
Last week , a senior Chinese army officer warned that Islamic separatists were the biggest danger to the Olympics .
CHINA'S UIGHURS Ethnically Turkic Muslims , mainly in Xinjiang Made bid for independent state in 1940s Sporadic violence in Xinjiang since 1991 Uighurs worried about Chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture Col Tian Yixiang of the Olympics security command centre told reporters the main threat came from the " East Turkestan terrorist organisation " .
The term is used by the government to refer to Islamist separatists in Xinjiang .
Late last month a group called the Turkestan Islamic Party said it had blown up buses in Shanghai and Yunnan , killing five people .
But China denied that the explosions were acts of terrorism .
The Washington - based IntelCenter , which monitors terrorism communications , said the Turkestan Islamic Party had released a video entitled Our Blessed Jihad in Yunnan .
In it , the group 's leader , Commander Seyfullah , said it was responsible for several attacks and threatened the Olympics .
" The Chinese have haughtily ignored our warnings , " IntelCenter quoted him as saying .
" The Turkestan Islamic Party volunteers ... have started urgent actions . "
' Evicted '
In Beijing , Chinese police and a small group of protesters clashed in Qianmen district , near Tiananmen Square .
The demonstrators complained that they had been evicted from their homes to make way for the reconstruction of the district .
The Olympic torch is due to be carried round a stadium in Mianyang , Sichuan province , which was used to house thousands of people forced from their homes by a devastating earthquake in May .
The torch will go on to the provincial capital in Chengdu on Tuesday before heading to Beijing for the opening ceremony on Friday .

What are these ?
The actress was a friend of Ledger
Actress Mary - Kate
Olsen will not speak to investigators about Heath Ledger 's death unless she is granted immunity from prosecution .
An official said the 22 - year - old wants the assurance before speaking to the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
Olsen was the first person contacted by the masseuse who discovered Ledger 's body .
Her lawyer said she has told the authorities all she knows .
Ledger was found dead at his home in January after an accidental overdose .
Federal investigators want to question Olsen about how Ledger obtained two powerful painkillers that contributed to his death .
Olsen 's lawyer , Michael C Miller , added that she " does not know the source of the drugs Mr Ledger consumed " .
Negotiations
According to the official - who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing - Mr Miller has twice refused requests for her to speak with them .
Investigators are in negotiations with Olsen 's lawyers and the prosecutor 's office , it was added .
Ledger 's ex-girlfriend Michelle Williams has answered questions voluntarily
The official said that authorities had obtained a subpoena that could force Olsen to appear before a grand jury if negotiations with her lawyer fail .
Other potential witnesses all have answered questions voluntarily , including doctors , Ledger 's ex-girlfriend Michelle Williams , and anyone who was in his apartment around the time of his death , the official added .
DEA investigators suspect the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone found in Ledger 's system were obtained with false prescriptions .
Police say the masseuse who discovered Ledger 's body spent nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialling 911 for help , then rang the actress a fourth time after paramedics arrived .
At some point during the calls , Olsen , who was in California at the time , summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help .
It must be August .
The Daily Mail is hunting for the Yeti again ( they sent their own expedition out in 1954 ) and mathematical formula season has begun in earnest .
PR guru Mark Borkowski's " fame formula " was gushingly reported in the Telegraph , the Express , the Star , OK , Channel 4 , ITN , and more .
The Guardian were lucky enough to obtain the rights to extract his book at length , focusing on the formula .
I trust the deal permits me also to reproduce large tracts of it here .
The formula is : F( T ) = B+ P( 1/10T+1/2T2 ) , where F is the level of fame , and T is time , measured in three - monthly intervals ( T=1 after three months , T=2 after six months ) .
All remaining units are predictably arbitrary .
" B is a base level of fame that we identified and quantified by analysing the average level of fame in the year before peak . "
I see .
" For George Clooney , B would be a large number , but for a fabulous nobody , like a new Big Brother contestant , B is zero .
P is the increment of fame above the base level . "
Does it work ?
He thinks so .
" This formula fits the data remarkably well , giving a precise numerical value to the 15 - month theory : if I put in T=5 ( corresponding to 15 months after the peak ) , it gives F=B+ P ( 1/50+1/50 ) , which works out at F=B+.04P .
In other words , up to 96 % of the fame - boost achieved at the peak of public attention has been frittered away . "
If Borkowski wishes to say that event - related fame declines rapidly with time , then he could just say so , and nobody would be desperately surprised .
We should be clear : even if we allow for its disappointing lack of ambition ( because all it says is that event - related fame declines with time ) , even if we generously disregard the pointless circularities in the definitions of its terms , this formula still fails , entirely on its own terms , to make any sense at all .
Let 's put some numbers in .
At the zero end of things , what if T is a small number ?
Borkowski acknowledges , in the Guardian at any rate ( and in brackets ) that this may be a problem .
" ( Putting T=0 into the equation gives an infinite fame peak , not mathematically accurate , perhaps , but the concept of the level of fame being off the radar is apposite . ) "
That does n't cover it .
As time tends towards zero , or rather , as the value for T approaches 0 , fame is approaching B + ( 1/0 ) + ( 1/0 ) , so the fame arising from any fame - event , as you get closer to it , tends extremely rapidly towards infinity , which is a very big number indeed .
Hang on : two numbers , both tending rapidly to infinity , both added together .
If I throw a poo at David Cameron tomorrow , under the terms of Borkowski's formula – what is the point of it if it does not work as a model ?
- in the moments after the poo leaves my hand , I seem to be more famous than any other person alive , anywhere in the world , my fame tending towards infinity , eclipsing any baserate fame ( B ) for any person alive .
At the other end of the scale , what if T is a large number ?
At the end of the universe , when the Sun has exploded , when humanity no longer exists , George Clooney will still have his current level of baseline fame , B . Nothing will change : imagine that .
In fact , imagine , only 400 years from now , in the year 2408 , when whole new unimaginable varieties of entertainment have risen , and fallen , alongside empires , cultures , religions , perhaps the very notion of fame has changed , but George Clooney still has his current level of baseline fame , B , just as the superstars of 1608 are household names today .
This is n't just mathematically crass , it 's historically ignorant .
These formulae are ubiquitous : the happiest day of the year ( sponsored by Walls ice cream ) ; the equation for beer goggles ( Bausch and Lomb ) ; the most depressing day of the year ( sponsored by Sky travel ) .
They are wheeled out endlessly by PR companies as a way of getting their brand into the newspapers , because they know what newspaper editors will go for , like the Yeti .
They know they hardly understand maths , or science , but that they think it 's clever , that all science is arbitrary , that boffins just make stuff up , so you might just as well too .
They add nothing to our understanding of any subject , and as for making maths " accessible " or " cool " – like Christian rock , perhaps - they do n't do anything for anyone , if they 're just plain wrong .
Your Hand Can Have A Mind On Its Own
The ‘ idle hand ’ which referred to as the ‘ Alien Hand Syndrome ’ is an unusual neurological disorder in which the sufferer ’s hand seems to take on a mind of its own .
This is due to the damage in the medial motor frontal region of the brain and often occurs after a brain surgery , a stroke or an infection of the brain .
The sufferer has no control over the movements of the ‘ alien hand ’ nor will they have any conscience idea on what that hand is doing .
The person suffering from this condition can often feel disconnected with their hand , and feel as if it was not part of their body .
When the suffer is unaware the alien hand can sometime act out complex movements like unbuttoning clothing , using tools or even tearing pieces of clothing .
There are no know treatments or cure for ‘ Alien Hand Syndrome ’ however the best solution is to give this alien hand an object it can play with to keep it distracted from doing anything harmful to the sufferer .
You Could Remove A Large Part of Your Internal Organs and SurviveWhile the human body may appear fragile , your body is stronger than you could possibly imagine .
It is possible for you to survive even after the removal of the spleen , the stomach , one kidney , one lung , 75 % of the liver , 80 % of the intestines , and almost every organ from the pelvic and groin area .
The Strong Contraction of Your Heart Creates Enough Pressure To Squirt Blood As Far As 30 Feet You Can Still Have An Erection After DeathThis is a death erection , which often being referred to as ‘ angel lust ’ .
It is a post - mortem erection that occurs when a male individual dies vertically or face - downside and as long as the body remains in this position , the effect will not subside .
How It Could Possibly Happen ?
When a man is still alive , the heart pumps blood evenly around the body .
When he dies , this mechanism stops and the blood acts by the force of gravity .
As with any mass , the blood will settle at the lowest point of the body and cause swelling .
So if a man dies vertically , the blood will settle in the legs and collect at the feet .
The pressure will cause the blood vessels and tissues in the feet to swell up to accommodate as much blood as possible .
As blood collects , it will fill up to the torso and the blood will attempt to move to a lower position due to gravity , which is the penis ( the legs are full by now ) .
The blood causes the penis , consisting of erectile tissue , to fill with blood and expand .
Heart Attacks Are More Likely To Happen
On MondayA 10 - year study in Scotland found that 20 % of people die of a heart attack on Monday ’s compare to any other day of the week .
The study suggests that the ‘ Monday peak ’ could be a result of massive drinking during the weekend and work related stress ; you know the ‘ Monday blues .
’ Three Hundred Million Cells Die In Your Body Every MinuteIt does sounds like a lot but this is actually less than 0.0001 % of the amount of cells being replaced in your body every day .
( about 10 - 50 trillion cells are being replace in your body every day ) Babies Have More Bones Than You DoWhen a baby is born , they have 300 bones in their body .
When they reach adulthood they are left with only 206 bones .
This is because the smaller bones eventually join together to form stronger single bones .
Your Hair Is Almost Indestructible Apart from having it burnt , human hair decays at such a slow rate that it is almost impossible to get rid of .
Do you remember those documentaries about Egypt , the pyramids and Mummies on Discovery Channel ?
Well the mummies are left with no flesh , practically nothing but bones and yes… hair .
It might look fragile but hair cannot be destroyed by cold , change of climate , water , or other natural forces and it is resistant to many kinds of acids and corrosive chemicals .
You Can Survive Without Food But Not Without Sleep
You need sleep as much as you need food .
Many people neglect the importance of having enough sleep without knowing that humans can actually survive longer without food than without sleep .
With water alone , an average person could survive a month to two without food ( that also varies from an individual ’s body fat and other factors ) .
But a few sleepless nights will cause the person to start experiencing radical personality and psychological changes .
The longest recorded time anyone has ever gone without sleep is 264 hours .
Randy Gardner at the end of which the experiment did not stumble or hallucinate but scientist has said that any more sleepless nights than that is dangerous .
You Have A PhiltrumThe indentation in the middle of the area between the nose and the upper lip is called the philtrum .
While scientists are yet to figure out the specific purpose of this indentation serves besides allowing humans to express a much larger range of lip motions , the ancient Greeks thought it to be one of the most arousing places on the body .

Sex seems to be everywhere these days , yet the details of Max Mosley 's privacy hearing have helped lift a veil on one type of sexual behaviour still shrouded in secrecy - sadomasochism .
As well as the whipping , the searching of hair for lice , and the harsh commands barked in gruff German , a News of the World video shown in Max Mosley 's High Court case has revealed a more tender face of the supposedly dark sadomasochistic lifestyle .
There were images of a post - session impromptu tea party between Mr Mosley and his female companions , alongside courtroom evidence from friends .
It 's something advocates for tolerance are keen to talk about , amid concern the Mosley case will further increase suspicion of such activities .
In doing so , they come up against the guardians of traditional morality - such as the Christian Action Research and Education ( CARE ) group which condemns " unconstructive " relationships based on " the dominion of one person over another " .
Max Mosley has called it " a perfectly harmless activity " Nobody knows how many people are involved in the " scene " : a loose grouping of people across the country who enjoy an unorthodox - and under current laws potentially illegal - sexual lifestyle .
However , one US study suggests 11 % of women and 14 % of men have engaged in BDSM - an abbreviation for bondage , discipline , domination , submission , sadism and masochism - activities .
If those figures are translated to the UK , it could mean around four million people have tried BDSM .
A smaller , but still substantial , number has chosen to make it a " lifestyle choice " .
The Mosley case has also confirmed historical prejudices about Britain 's long - standing " spanking " tradition - the famous flagellation scene in the 18th Century novel Fanny Hill , being just one example .
" Just a little harmless English S&M " , was how Time magazine headlined its account of the court hearing .
It concluded : " On this island where manners mean everything , one takes one 's whipping with a stiff upper lip . "
According to the former editor of the Erotic Review , Rowan Pelling , Britain is " still known abroad as the ' nation of floggers ' " .
" A lot of it has to do with the way we have historically treated children , " says Ms Pelling , " sending them away to boarding school from an early age .
Plus , the British are thought to be repressed - and any repression will result in somewhat recherche and unusual sexual activities . "
Fetish parties Faith , a professional " mistress " , offers up a starker insight .
Reclining on a large velvet covered bed in the " playroom " attic of her country cottage , and surrounded by the tools of her trade , she describes sometimes extreme acts in words of " trust " and " consent " .
When a client walks through the door I will have them strip and kneel on the floor in front of me
Faith , a professional mistress
For £ 160 , usually preceded by an e-mail discussion as to what will happen , she offers " to help explore a client 's fantasy , self and sexuality " .
Although at ease with her chosen lifestyle , she would rather her identity was kept secret to save any grief from neighbours .
Anonymity is a basic tenet of the BDSM world .
Many of the men she sees are married or , like Mr Mosley , she says , in high - profile jobs that prevent them from taking part in Britain 's lively BDSM " scene " with its fetish parties and informal get - togethers .
" Most clients I see are submissive - they want me to be in control , " she says .
" When a client walks through the door I will have them strip and kneel on the floor in front of me - they will not even question that . "
What follows depends on what has been previously agreed , but Faith is adamant that she offers not just the indulgence of a fantasy , but therapy that helps those who are distressed by their fetish - or disappointed when the reality of their fantasy fails to live up to expectations .
" At that point I need to find something that he can cope with , that he actually needs .
So it needs me to be very supportive at that stage - to instantly switch into nurturing , trying to pull him together and pull him through and explore what will work for him . "
She muses over her clients ' motives .
" It 's a natural part of human nature to seek some kind of endorphin rush .
You can do that through sport and nobody thinks that wrong .
If you take that same rush and put it into a BDSM environment you can see why people like spanking .
They have got the fear of coming into this environment and fear of putting themselves in that position of trust .
Brutal murder " Then they get the pain and challenge that creates the endorphins - so they accentuate that with the pleasure .
" For me , it 's about instilling a little fear - to get a rush . "
DAVID AKA MASTER COSMIC
" When we are out socially , she will go ahead and open the door for me . "
" When she serves coffee it will be placed carefully in my upturned palm so I do n't have to reach for it . "
" There is a big difference between a dominant and a bully .
I am very aware that I am receiving the gift of submission .
" Psychologists say that those who embark in BDSM " play " usually come to an agreement about the roles they will play : dominant ( " top " ) , or submissive ( " bottom " ) .
Sometimes the practices move out of the bedroom and into everyday life .
In such cases , both people consent to a longer - term master - slave relationship , based on mutual trust , and on the condition that either can pull out at a time of their choosing .
But lurid reports of BDSM sessions that have gone wrong - such the brutal murder in 2004 of film agent Rod Hall during an S&M " game " - have helped create a difficult environment in which these relationships can flourish openly .
According to Darren Langdridge , co-author of a book about BDSM , Safe Sane and Consensual , the media " have focused on the non-consensual examples of BDSM - but there are many couples who make BDSM a part of their stable relationship " .
The problem , he says is that when sex and violence get mixed up , people struggle to understand it , and get worried .
" But in my view BDSM as just another extension of everyday sexual experience . "
It 's not an argument that wins over traditionalist opponents of the BDSM lifestyle .
Seeking pain , they say , is " not constructive " .
" We feel strongly about the value of human life , and whilst these sorts of things may happen between two consenting adults ... it is the dominion of one person over another , " says a spokesman for Care .
" Because it is this sort of relationship we do not see it as constructive .
These practices can also lead to serious injury , or even death .
And it is the families of the people who die who suffer in the end . "
Puppies
But many of those in BDSM relationships are fiercely protective of their lifestyle choice .
Some are almost evangelical about its benefits .
A " dominant " calling himself Sir Guy says it 's a " chance to forget all adult responsibilities and - in the best sense of the word - be irresponsible .
One of my puppies [ his term for a submissive ] refers to his sessions as ' holidays from humanity ' . "
The Skin Two Rubber Ball , for those who can take their BDSM public Another , " Suzanne " , a 42 - year - old submissive married to her dominant " master " , says she has given herself " totally to the man " .
" We never argue and his word is final .
It means that I do n't have to worry about making decisions .
It 's a relaxed lifestyle that gives me a tremendous sense of freedom . "
Some research backs up anecdotal evidence that people who choose BDSM as a way of life are no more unstable than the general population - and might even be happier .
A soon - to - be published study of nearly 20,000 Australians concluded those who took part in BDSM activities were " no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious " .
" What we are finding is that people who engage in BDSM activities are not weirdoes , " says Dr Richard de Visser , of Sussex University , " they just choose a certain sexual activity . "
Yet some say suspicion has helped demonise BDSM and create discriminatory laws - such as the one that forbids , unless " transitory or trifling " , blood - letting during sexual play .
It is this law that the News of the World claims Mr Mosley broke - and part of its justification for publishing details of a secretly - filmed session .
Yet those who share Mr Mosley 's sexual tastes have n't necessarily welcomed the wider expose this case has brought .
Deborah Hyde , of the lobby group Backlash - a group that campaigns for human rights issues within the BDSM community - is worried more people will get the wrong idea about BDSM .
" A lot of the time it 's about understanding the language - and what really is going on .
Actually , at the end of the day it 's just a game - and no more threatening compared to the other games people play , like Dungeons and Dragons , or even going to Star Trek conventions . "

I have been involved with fetish parties for nearly two decades : for most of the 90s we operated in a large venue in King 's Cross , shared by us and every other type of party on other nights of the week .
Ours was the only night in that venue when the in - house security staff felt they could work without stab vests or body armour : violence - of an extreme and life - threatening nature - was the rule on every other event , and we were the exception .
I could write a whole book about what we learned during those years ( until closed down by the Admiral Duncan bomber , incidentally ) but all I will say on this occasion is that BDSM is one of those fields where the best - informed freely admit they know only a little ; the utterly ignorant are the ones who shout the loudest .

It 's interesting that every High Street lingerie shop sells fluffy handcuffs or soft rope , yet the press still insist on presenting BDSM as some sort of bizarre secret subculture .
It is also disappointing that the press always seem to pruriently focus on the juicier aspects such as dungeons , secret clubs , masochism , whipping etc , and disregards the notion of loving couples engaged in perfectly healthy kinky activities involving role play , spanking , fantasy , restraint , trust , fun and sensation .
Ultimately , why is it anyone 's business what consenting adults do together privately , as long as it is all safe , sane and consensual ?

This to me was an interesting part : " It is the dominion of one person over another , " says a spokesman for Care .
" Because it is this sort of relationship we do not see it as constructive . "
I practice BDSM with my partner , I am the submissive in it .
There is a great comfort in knowing you can trust this other person wholeheartedly , and you can be who you are .
For a BDSM relationship to work the key element is trust - no one can submit to anyone else without it , otherwise the relationships just do not last .
It is not all one way either , as a submissive I may be nurtured but I also look after my dominant , helping them relax and seeing them smile .
The ' dominion ' is carefully negotiated , and our limits respected .
Is this really so different from a conventional relationship ?

There 's nothing more British than a right royal spanking followed by a nice cup of tea .
It helped build the Empire .
James Rigby , Wickford , Essex
What frustrates me about the media coverage is the emphasis writers choose to focus on .
There is nothing " immoral " or " wrong " about BDSM itself .
Any sexual activity between truly CONSENTING ADULTS where no - one is being hurt emotionally is fine by me .
What strikes me as " immoral " whenever these stories come up is the acceptance of hiring prostitutes , or having a sexual relationship outside of your marriage that your spouse has not agreed to .
Paying people for sex is wrong , cheating on and lying to your wife or husband is wrong , BDSM in the right context is harmless .

You have fallen into the trap so cunningly laid by the News of the World 's defence lawyers - it is not what Mr Mosely chooses to do with consenting partners that matters , it is his right to do so in privacy that is at issue .
And as a lifelong player of Dungeons & Dragons I take offence at it being compared to any sex act , however innocuous .
Megan , Cheshire , UK
It is a myth that sadism is a common sexual expression for people of naturally domineering , bullying personalities .
In my experience people who are alpha - type personalities or in positions of great power and authority in their careers are usually submissive sexually .
In this way S&M gives people a chance to let go of the reigns and hand over the responsibility to someone else for a while .
It 's very cathartic and refreshing .
Do n't judge what people do in their bedrooms .
You certainly would n't like it if the tables were turned and missionary - style , vanilla sex was deemed " unhealthy . "
SM , UK For every case that can be located showing some form of injury or death relating to BDSM , at least one can be found showing injury during a " normal " act .
In most relationships , one person is more in control and dictates the flow of decision making .
How does that differ from a dom / sub relationship other than the fact that it works itself into a little pain from time to time ?
People do a wide variety of things that cause pain to themselves in one way shape or form .
Most of which are n't illegal .
Why should this be ?
Leilani Newton , Middleburg , Florida , US I 'm part of the " scene " in my local area , and I live as a submissive with my Master , my fiance .
We 're very much in love , and have a lot of respect for each other , to the extent that we 'll try new things , and trust each other to stop when we need to .
BDSM play should not be illegal , nor is it the public 's right to know who is or is not partaking of such a pleasure .
It 's as much a part of me as my love of chocolate .
F , UK Every time there is a new addition to supposedly harmless sexual acts .
Why can't we just have normal sexual relationships between a man a woman ?
But this is the result of sexual " freedom " - deprivation , uncontrolled lust , and really the freedom of indulging into fantasy acts between " consenting adults " .
I do n't think we can do anything about it .
It 's too late now .
AB , Birmingham Frankly , it scares me to know what people will do in the name of recreation .
How can physical aggression , bleeding wounds , broken bones , dirt , humiliation , orchestrated and ritualised violence and even deaths have any place in the psyche of any rational adult ?
Anyway , so much for rugby .
And boxing , wrestling , judo and any other competitive contact sport you care to name , all of which are essentially substitutes for sex anyway .
BDSM sounds much safer , plus there 's at least a chance you 'll find your fellow participants sexually attractive , unlike rugby .
Er , presumably .

What people get up to in the privacy of their own relationships is entirely up to them , unless it 's a matter of state security or some such .
After all , handcuffs , floggers and gags are available in the High Street courtesy of Anne Summers ; this can only be because there is a market for such things .
I do n't really indulge in S&M ( it just hurts , frankly , which is a good way to tell if it's for you ) , but I have a dominant / submissive based relationship ( with me as the S ) - it 's just the way we are , it works well , and it 's no one 's business but ours .
And hopefully soon the press will stop tainting the lives of my friends and acquaintances with the fear of " being outed " , for the way they lead their relationships and their sex lives .

It 's clear to me that England is becoming more Satanic in nature every day , and the people who work for the BBC must take some responsibility for that .

It is as much about how you think as how you act .
Certain relationships will work with this , others wo n't .
If people are consensual and know their boundaries - then this can be a healthy relationship or incorporated into one .
Mistress C , UK
My fiancee and I are very much into BDSM and its different variants .
To see the News of the World acting as the unappointed and unwanted moral guardians to the country is disheartening .
How are we to learn to respect each other when tabloids will swoop on anything unusual and demonise it to line their pockets ?
This country is simmering with repressed desires and fetishes .

What are these ?
Security leaks , Trojan horses , phishing scams , viruses , worms , fraud , data swapping , at a glance the World Wide Web can appear to be a fraudster 's paradise and certainly not somewhere you should go near with your bank details .
However , despite the well - publicised risks most people shop and bank online without any such issues .
Yes there are risks , but if you 're sensible you can stay secure .
Here 's what you need to stay safe online :
1 ) Make sure your computer is up to the job
Staying safe online requires preparation and the first step is making sure your computer is up to the job .
You 'll need an up to date anti-virus and a firewall as the absolute minimum , although more comprehensive protection like anti-spyware is advisable .
Most major banks offer free security software that 's designed to protect your banking details and this is definitely worth using too - Trusteer Rapport is the most widely recommended by major UK banks .
Sadly mobile devices can also be targeted so if you 're browsing on the go you need to be confident that your phone or tablet can keep your details private .
Thankfully most of the major internet security services now offer mobile versions of their software and banks and building societies are beginning to offer useful , secure mobile apps which offer more protection than just logging on through a web browser on the go .
2 ) Check the website is legit
Although it can be tricky to tell if a website is trustworthy there are some key indicators that you can use to assess them , including :
Poorly written content
Unrelated images appearing on the site
Out of date security certificates
Incorrect URL , have you been re-directed elsewhere ?
Invalid contact details
Poor reviews
For more help read our 5 ways to check a website is legit
3 ) Is the web page secure ?
Once you 're happy that your computer is secure and the website is the real deal , the next step is to check whether the web page is secure .
Major banks and retailers will only ask for you bank or card details from a secured internet connection .
Thankfully there is an easy way for us all to tell when we are browsing on a secured network , the http : at the start of the web address will change to https : .
This stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and ensures that your personal details are not being snooped upon .
You should always check you are on a secure https connection before sharing any of your banking details .
If you have internet security or anti virus software then that will also indicate when you are browsing on a secure internet connection , giving you extra reassurance .
4 ) Do n't take the phishing bait
Phishing scams are one of the most common tricks used by fraudsters to get hold of banking details .
These cunning ploys work by convincing you to share your bank details with what you think is a legitimate company .
Phishing emails are the preferred tactic , but phishing links or forms on fake websites are becoming more and more common .
To stay safe online it 's imperative that you 're on guard against phishing scams and do n't take the bait - for more help spotting them read our guide to checking a website is legitimate .
5 ) Use a credit card
A sensible precaution is to use a credit card for online transactions .
It will help you keep track of the purchases you make more easily so you can spot any fraudulent transactions quickly if your details are compromised .
Using a credit card rather than a debit card also provides you with extra protection because it keeps the money in your current account safe .
If someone does get their hands on your details , they can't bleed your accounts dry ; and the card itself will have anti-fraud measures in place ( plus procedures for dealing with fraud victims ) .
The media have covered such recent events as the Olympics , the selection of Joe Biden as the Vice Presidential candidate for the Democratic Party , and what John McCain is going to do about the selection of the Vice President of the Republican Party .
Now the media will focus on the national convention of the Democratic Party .
The most important news for the month of August was the fact that President Bush has quietly sent the largest armada into the Persian Gulf since the Iraq war began in 2003 , when there were six carrier groups .
This is a huge number of ships to be concentrated in one location in peacetime .
This story has been completely ignored by the news media all over the West .
The only coverage is from special - interest websites .
It was only on Saturday morning , August 23 , that I learned what was going on .
I spent most of Saturday in an attempt to verify the basic story .
Some of this story is easily verifiable .
Other parts of it are circumstantial , but nevertheless compelling .
I posted the story on my site late in the afternoon .
You can read the details here .
Here is the basic story .
Two aircraft carrier task forces , the Abraham Lincoln and the Peleliu , are already in the Persian Gulf .
This is verifiable on the Websites of the carriers .
A third task force , the Iwo Jima , was dispatched to the Gulf on August 22 .
This has been verified by a naval source .
Two more — the Theodore Roosevelt and the Ronald Reagan — are said to be sailing to the Gulf , but I was unable to verify this from official sources .
The Jerusalem Post reported this , as did at least one Egyptian newspaper cited by the Post .
The Arab world is aware of all this .
Western audiences are not .
We do know from naval sources that in July , the Theodore Roosevelt was involved in joint naval maneuvers with the French Navy .
Think about this for a moment .
When was the last time you read of joint naval operations between the United States Navy and the French Navy ?
In 2007 , in the North Arabian Sea .
Third - party sources report that French ships , along with British ships , are accompanying the Theodore Roosevelt to the Gulf .
This would indicate a joint military venture .
THE BLACKOUT
This is receiving no coverage by the media of the Western nations .
It is a non-event .
Yet if I know about it , and if I have been able to verify three - fifths of the story by official sources , then there is no question in my mind that any of the major news media that wanted to assign one lone individual to tracing down the details of this story would be able to do this without a great deal of difficulty .
Yet the media have remained absolutely silent about this .
This sounds fishy to me .
It sounds as though there is a coordinated effort among Western owners of the media to make certain that the voters are kept in the dark .
Why should this story not be front - page news ?
Two very good reasons are the fragility of the economy with oil under $ 130 a barrel , and what could happen if it goes to $ 400 .
Nobody wants to trigger bank runs .
The existence of an armada of this size raises an obvious question : Against which nation in the Persian Gulf is such an armada to be used ?
The answer is obvious : Iran .
If this armada is to be used against Iran , the next question arises :
What will happen to the price of oil if Iranian exports of oil are cut off by an armada whose purpose is to stop all trade with Iran ?
Second question :
What would happen to the price of oil if Iran sinks two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz ?
Third question :
What would happen to maritime insurance rates for oil tankers in the Persian Gulf ?
This raises a fourth question :
Is the fleet ’s purpose to police the Strait of Hormuz , to make certain that the land - based anti-ship missiles that may have been installed by Iran can be stopped ?
Fifth question :
Why would Iran sink oil tankers , apart from wartime ?
These questions relate to the supply of oil .
The price of oil , as with the price of all other commodities , is set at the margin .
The problem with the price of oil is that it is so volatile .
There are no short - term supplies of oil that can come on - stream in response to rising prices .
Because increased supplies do not respond to an increase in the price of oil , prices rise very fast and very high whenever there is a major interruption of oil production or delivery .
IRANIAN RETALIATION
If Iran is attacked by either the United States or the Israeli Air Force , there will be retaliation by the Iranians .
Iranian leaders have made it clear repeatedly that an attack on Iran by the Israeli Air Force will be regarded as an attack by the United States .
At that point , the Middle East will begin to unravel .
If the Israeli Air Force attacks Iran , this will create an instant unified resistance movement by Muslims throughout the Middle East .
This will include Sunni Muslims .
The hatred of the Israelis by Muslims in the region is so intense that even though the Israeli Air Force attacks at Shi’ite nation , Sunni leaders will not be in a position to publicly justify such an attack .
They would risk a revolution in their own countries if they did this .
The best that the Israelis could expect would be silent neutrality .
Retaliation on the part of Iran will be expected by all Muslim nations in the Middle East .
What could Iran do to impose negative sanctions on the United States ?
The first thing it can do is to stop all oil exports .
This would create an economic depression in Iran .
But if the armada is controlling the flow of goods into Iran anyway , then why not stop the export of Iranian oil ?
If Iran can not buy the goods that revenues from the sale of the oil would provide , then Iran ’s leaders might as well get some credit with their people for having stood up to the Americans .
Iranian leaders will be able to say , accurately , that since United States has gone to war with Iran by creating an embargo around Iran , the smart thing to do is to inflict great economic damage on the United States .
The leaders will be able to tell the people to buckle down , cut expenses , and suffer because this is the price of war with the Great Satan , which has indulged in an act of war against Iran .
All the bad effects can be blamed on the United States , and all the tough talk will strengthen the regime that is in power at the time that the embargo is first announced .
This will wipe out any so - called moderates in Iran .
The nation will come together against the United States .
Next , Iran can begin to create havoc for American troops by supplying small arms to Shia militias inside Iraq and by supplying resistance fighters inside Afghanistan .
There is nothing that the United States can do to stop the flow of low - cost , low - intensity arms out of Iran .
The American death toll in both Iraq and Afghanistan would increase .
The surge would find itself facing a much greater counter - surge .
NATO forces in Afghanistan will begin to suffer a series of defeats .
This will certainly please Vladimir Putin .
This will advance Russian hegemony in the region .
All the Russians have to do is tell the world that they oppose this unauthorized embargo on Iran , and that it opposes any air strikes inside Iran by the United States or the Israeli Air Force .
At this point , Russia will become a verbal ally of the Islamic world .
This will be an enormous diplomatic advantage for Russia .
It will be an extraordinary diplomatic disadvantage for the United States .
Because imposing an embargo was an act of war , and because Iran would have no particular reason to settle with the United States on terms that are in any way favorable to the United States , the Iranians need only bide their time .
At some point , if the armada is removed from the Strait , the Iranians will again be in a position to sabotage oil tankers going through the Strait .
So , once this embargo is imposed , it has to become permanent .
The tactic that would impose the greatest financial loss on the United States would be to sink oil tankers in the Strait .
If the Iranians can sink as few as two tankers , this will result in huge increases in maritime insurance premiums for oil tankers sailing through the Strait .
This would reduce the supply of oil reaching the West .
Whether Iran can attack oil tankers in the Strait when the Strait is protected by American warships is a tactical question that I am not capable of answering accurately .
It may be that Iran ’s land - based missiles can be taken out by naval air power .
But this would mean that the armada must remain inside the straight permanently .
If Iran ceases to export oil , this alone would be sufficient to drive the price of oil into regions that will push the West into a recession .
Thus , it is ominous that President Bush , as Commander - in - Chief of the Armed Forces , has ordered the five carrier task forces into the region .
I realize that the price of oil has not responded yet to this strategic move .
The best thing we can say at this point is that the oil markets do not appear to regard this strategic move of the United States Navy as a serious threat to the supply of oil from the Middle East .
Given the high - risk situation that has been created by the failure of subprime mortgages in the United States , an oil shock that drives oil above $ 200 a barrel is likely to create bankruptcies in major banks all over the West .
Depositors are already jumpy .
If it appears that the Western economies are going to go into a simultaneous recession , because of a sharp increase in the price of oil that is likely to become permanent , the West ’s banking system , and surely its capital markets , will be at risk .
The Iranians understand this .
There is no reason why the rest of us should not understand this .
Hence , there is a blackout on all information of the assembling of the armada all over the Western world .
A UNITED FRONT
Islamic societies do not tolerate military activities of non-Islamic nations against Islamic nations except in support of one Islamic nation against an invasion by another Islamic nation .
It was possible for President George H. W. Bush to mobilize support from Sunni Islamic nations in the first Gulf War because Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait .
This was perceived as an attack by a secular national leader against an Islamic nation .
President Bush understood that this did not authorize the conquest of Iraq by the West .
This is why he stopped American troops from capturing Baghdad .
The capture of Baghdad and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein were not part of the agreement by which the United States received financial and logistical support from oil - exporting Islamic nations in the Gulf .
The United States since 2003 has been able to gain grudging support by Sunni nations in the region only because the official justification for the invasion was to fight Al Qaeda .
Al Qaeda is perceived by the oligarchies of the region as a threat to their own existence .
Also , Saddam Hussein was perceived , not as a practicing Muslim , but as a secular autocrat .
The United States was able to gain support from Pakistan , but this has created such resistance inside Pakistan that Musharraf has finally been forced out of office .
The thing that oil - exporting Muslim nations worry most about is the possibility that Iran will retaliate by sinking oil tankers that pass through the Strait of Hormuz .
On this issue , oil - exporting Muslim nations may be willing to accept the presence of a Western armada in the Middle East .
If the justification of the armada is to keep open the Hormuz Straight , oil - exporting nations may cooperate with the United States .
They will not be able to say anything favorable toward Israel , but they may keep quiet about the use of the armada as a way to maintain revenues for themselves .
IF NOT OIL , THEN WHAT ?
I have three other questions .
What is it that oil investors believe is a legitimate role for these carrier groups in the Persian Gulf that is not in some way related to the export of oil ?
What is it that these carrier groups will do for the stability of oil exports from the region ?
Why is it that these carrier groups are required to do what one carrier group was expected to earlier in the year ?
There is no question that this is a major military show of force in the region .
President Bush has decided to make this show of force .
He has done so without informing the American media regarding the reason for this show of force .
If the reason has nothing to do with Iran , he should say so .
If the reason has something to do with Iran , then he should publicly discuss the question of the supply of oil exported from the Middle East .
He should discuss how he intends to enable Iran to continue to export oil to the West , yet at the same time persuade the Iranians to change their policy on nuclear development .
What is it that five carrier task forces in the Persian Gulf can do to persuade the Iranians to change their policies , other than by interdicting oil trade with Iran ?
If this armada does this , how will Iranian oil exports not be affected ?
If these carrier forces are to interdict goods coming into Iran , what motivation does Iran have for continuing to export its most vital commodity , when Iran will not be able to use the proceeds from the sale of this commodity in order to buy Western goods ?
If President Bush imposes an embargo on shipping in and out of Iran , and he does so after the November election but before the inauguration of a new President , he will deliver to the new administration a third war .
The surge in Iraq will prove to have been a short - lived operation that succeeded only because Shia militias and the Shia - run government of Iraq decided to let the Americans alone .
Meanwhile , Afghanistan will become a disaster zone , and will remain a disaster zone for as long as Western troops are in the country .
Iran need only sit and wait .
The new administration will find that the world economy is disintegrating , that oil prices have moved up to such an extent that American voters will demand action , and the only action that will make any sense will be to withdraw all forces from the region .
At that point , the Western economy will be completely dependent upon the good will of the Iranians .
If Iran stops the flow of oil by sinking tankers in the Strait of Hormuz , the price of oil will become astronomical .
The greatest winner in such a scenario would be Russia .
Russia would be in a position of almost complete monopoly over the oil markets .
Under such a scenario , the new administration would have one problem to deal with , and that problem is war in the Middle East .
All other issues , domestic and international , would fade into insignificance on the day oil goes over $ 200 a barrel .
Yet this could happen after the election but before the inauguration .
President Bush will depart , and his replacement will be saddled with an economic disaster , a military disaster , and a domestic political disaster .
There will not be a thing that the newly elected President can do prior to January 20 to deal with this problem .
President Bush will be in absolute control because he is lawfully the Commander - in - Chief of the Armed Forces .
There could be a move to impeach him , but Congress has proven so utterly impotent over the last two years , and so utterly fearful of challenging the President on the issue of the war , that it is unlikely that Congress could mount a successful impeachment and trial by the Senate during the two - month period between the election of a new President and his inauguration .
If you think the price of oil would be astronomical under the conditions I have already described , add to this an impeachment attempt by Congress .
That would tie up the Bush administration , which would mean that its policies in the Middle East will be set in concrete until January 20 , 2009 .
All of this may seem hypothetical .
But , as Forrest Gump ’s mother might say , hypothetical is as hypothetical does .
What is not hypothetical is the presence of this many carrier task forces in the Persian Gulf .
If the carriers sailing in are merely to replace carriers which will soon be sailing out , the Defense Department ’s public affairs spokesman could say so .
He could also cite the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
With the Middle Eastern press warning of an invasion , and rhetoric against Iran escalating , and Pakistan falling apart , now is not the time for silence .
Business as usual is for times as usual .
The media have been completely successful in blocking all information about this , not just in the United States , but in the Western countries generally .
Nobody is paying any attention to this , except in the Middle East press .
This includes oil investors .
My opinion is that this blindness is going to result in a military disaster before the end of 2009 .
If President Bush goes on national television this week to explain why he ordered this armada into the region , and this explanation is plausibly unrelated to Iran , oil , and the Strait of Hormuz , then I am willing to consider the possibility that the scenarios that I have outlined here are simply hypothetical .
There may be a cogent explanation for why this many ships should be in the Persian Gulf .
But in the middle of a tinder box , it is unwise to light matches .
CONCLUSION
You should think carefully about the implications of $ 400 oil on your family ’s finances .
You should also think carefully about $ 400 oil ’s effect on your employer ’s finances .
You should then think very carefully about what might be a plausible explanation for five carrier task forces in the Persian Gulf that do not point to $ 400 oil by January 20 , 2009 .

Solar Clothing Makes Charging Electronic Devices Easy
August 18th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Solar - powered clothing could be the next big trend for environmental enthusiasts .
Researchers at North Carolina State University have designed a process called digital textile printing that makes it possible for solar panels to be fitted into jackets and ties .
The wearable solar panels act much like batteries when energized .
With a consistency similar to paper , the panels should n’t weigh its wearers down too much .
However , the researchers did find problems with the neck tie : the solar panels make it extremely difficult to tie knots .
They propose using a clip - on tie to remedy this problem .
The research team ’s tie design contains a cell - phone pocket and 3.6V plug - in .
And no , the solar clothing does n’t create any dangerous electric shocks .
While the solar tie and jacket idea is n’t the first solar - powered clothing idea , it might be the most practical .
Triumph International Japan ’s solar - powered bra would be great — if only it worked when covered up by clothing .

As the movie Footloose taught us , some little backwater towns have a real hate for some bizarre things like dancing and youthful exuberance .
Well some people apparently missed the scene where dancing makes everyone 's troubles disappear , because they continue to outlaw the most petty and ridiculous shit they can think of .
For example ...

13 Indoor Nudity ( Villahermosa , Mexico )
The usual ban on outdoor nudity , or at least male outdoor nudity , is fully supported by us and we recognize it as one of the great achievements of modern civilization .
The town of Villahermosa , Mexico , however , has decided to take it a step further .
Citing a lack of morality , Villahermosa 's town council has halted its citizens from wandering about their own homes , swinging in the breeze .
After all , who wants to creep onto someone 's property and peep in their windows only to find them nude in their own homes ?
That kind of fucked up stuff may be kosher in Sweden , but not Mexico .

Sure , we get it : a fat , naked dude indoors is really just a few short steps from being a fat , naked dude outdoors .
But we 're pretty sure waging preemptive wars against gross public nudity is just as frowned upon as the other kind .
12 Silly String ( Los Angeles )
In LA , there is a scourge that few people dare mention out loud .
It is not only nefarious , but remarkably retarded .
It is Silly String .
For years , citizens faced each Halloween on Hollywood Boulevard like Anne Frank , hiding away and hoping for the madness to end .
Finally , one heroic Captain America stood up to the terror of Silly String and put a stop to it , banning it under penalty of a $ 1,000 fine .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
That hero was city councilor Tom LaBonge .
The ban is for just one night out of the year -- Halloween - - and resulted from complaints that random Silly String sprayings resulted in fistfights during the usual Halloween street gatherings .
There were reports of people actually throwing the cans at each other , according to police , which means maybe instead of a ban , they should have simply offered classes on proper Silly String use .
11 Fishbowls ( Monza , Italy ) Continue Reading Below Advertisement
In Italy , the problems of modern man are on a scale that North Americans can barely comprehend .
While poverty , the environment , prohibition , chlamydia , dog racing , incest and overactive sweat glands are all that trouble us from day to day , in Monza , Italy they have all that back - burnered so they can deal with really intense shit like what happens to a fish if you keep it in a fishbowl .
Do you know what happens to a fish if you keep it in a fishbowl ?
It sees the world all fucked up , that 's what .
The cleaned up version , according to town council is that a fishbowl provides " a distorted view of reality . "
So it 's kind of like the fish Matrix .
Only we 're the machines .
We 're the fucking machines !

Actual view from inside a fishbowl .
Luckily for the fish , the council has banned the bowls in favor of square aquariums which , presumably , represent a fish 's depressing reality in an accurate and heart warming fashion .

Neurologist Robert A. Burton , MD has written a gem of a book : On Being Certain : Believing You Are Right Even When You ’re Not .
His thesis is that “ Certainty and similar states of ‘ knowing what we know ’ arise out of involuntary brain mechanisms that , like love or anger , function independently of reason . ”
Your certainty that you are right has nothing to do with how right you are .
Within 24 hours of the Challenger explosion , psychologist Ulric Neisser had 106 students write down how they ’d heard about the disaster , where they were , what they were doing at the time , etc .
Two and a half years later he asked them the same questions .
25 % gave strikingly different accounts , more than half were significantly different , and only 10 % had all the details correct .
Even after re-reading their original accounts , most of them were confident that their false memories were true .
One student commented , “ That ’s my handwriting , but that ’s not what happened . ”
Just as we may “ know ” things that clearly are n’t true , we may think we do n’t know when we really do .
In the phenomenon of blindsight , patients with a damaged visual cortex have no awareness of vision , but can reliably point to where a light flashes when they think they are just guessing .
And there are states of “ knowing ” that do n’t correspond to any specific knowledge : mystical or religious experiences .
A “ feeling of knowing ” probably had an evolutionary advantage .
If we are certain , we can act on that certainty rather than hesitating like Hamlet .
Certainty makes us feel good : it rewards learning , and it keeps us from wasting time thinking too much ; but it impairs flexibility .
Richard Feynman said ,
“ I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing .
I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things …
It does n’t frighten me . ”
On the other hand , many people , especially religious fundamentalists , ca n’t deal with uncertainty .
They demand absolute answers and cling to their certainties even in the face of contrary evidence .
Why are people so different in their need for certainty ?
We know there is a gene associated with risk - taking and novelty - seeking .
Burton makes an intriguing suggestion : could genetic differences make individuals get different degrees of pleasure out of the feeling of knowing ?
There is a “ hidden layer ” in our brain whose neurons are influenced by genetics , personal experience , hormones , and chemistry .
These factors influence all our thought processes without our conscious knowledge .
We would like to think that if everyone had the same information they would necessarily reach the same conclusion , but that just is n’t so .
There is no such thing as pure reason .
“ Reason is not disembodied , as the tradition has largely held , but arises from the nature of our brains , bodies , and bodily experiences . ”
The autonomous rational mind is a myth .
The concepts of the self and free will are innate useful fictions that allow us to function .
As Samuel Johnson said , “ All theory is against the freedom of the will ; all experience is for it . ”
Modern neurophysiology tells us our decisions are made subconsciously before we are aware of deciding .
Burton discusses how certainty interferes with science .
“ Integrative medicine ” guru Andrew Weil set up tests of osteopathic manipulation for ear infections , and when the experiments showed no effect , he said , “ I ’m sure there ’s an effect there .
We could n’t capture it in the way we set up the experiment . ”
This kind of thinking is rampant in alternative medicine .
Burton thinks that if Dr. Weil recommends osteopathy for an ear infection , he should inform the patient that the recommendation is based on an unconfirmed belief .
Richard Dawkins rejects religion but finds purpose and meaning in science .
Burton suggests that purpose and meaning are powerful innate feelings .
We feel that our life has purpose and meaning , and we look to science or religion to try to explain that feeling .
No amount of rational argument is likely to change us .
“ Whether an idea originates in a feeling of faith or appears to be the result of pure reason , it arises out of a personal hidden layer that we can neither see nor control . ”
Burton thinks irrational beliefs can have adaptive benefits ( for instance , the placebo effect ) and thinks objectivity and reason should be seen in the larger context of our biological needs and constraints .
If science and religion could both accept that all our facts are really provisional , absolutism could be dethroned and a dialog might become possible .
What if religious fundamentalists acknowledged even a 0.0000000001 % possibility that their beliefs were false ?
Biology teaches us that absolutism is an untenable stance of ignorance .
I have long thought that absolutism was one of humanity ’s greatest problems .
There are implications for politics , religion , and every sphere of human activity .
The insights from this book can be applied to every human interaction from marital squabbles to terrorism .
It may be frightening to recognize the limits of our knowledge .
It will be hard for some to give up their cherished certainties , but Burton says he has gained an extraordinary sense of an inner quiet born of acknowledging his limitations .
As a reminder that there is never a 100 % guarantee that we are right , Burton suggests we use the words “ I believe ” instead of “ I know . ”
This is the one place where I disagree with him : I do n’t like either word .
Belief sounds too much like faith .
I do n’t like the idea of saying I believe evolution is true .
Truth in science , at best , can only mean that the evidence is overwhelming .
We ca n’t “ know ” absolutely in a metaphysical sense .
We provisionally accept evolution because the evidence is so overwhelming that it would be perverse to reject it .
We remain open to new evidence .
The author is a neurologist who is also a novelist and a columnist for Salon.com .
This well - written book is the result of many years of cogitation by a wise clinician .
He supports his arguments with tales of neurology patients , recent research into brain function , and examples of how our senses constantly fool us .
Burton says , “ In medicine , we are increasingly developing ethical standards for complex medical decisions that both allow for hope and placebo effect , yet do n’t fly in the face of evidence - based medical knowledge . ”
This subject has come up on this blog before , and it is one we will continue to grapple with .
If there ’s anything you think you ’re certain of , read this book and you may change your mind .

The 42nd U.S. President , Bill Clinton , delivered a top 10 laundry list of actions that the U.S. government should take to help solve the energy crisis during a speech to kick off the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas on Monday night .
Along with the list , which advocated various incentives to accelerate the proliferation of clean technologies , Clinton suggested some more controversial plans : he raised the idea of a single state , like Nevada , or an area like Puerto Rico becoming energy independent — he said this could “ rock the world . ”
And beyond his concrete policy advice , Clinton also confirmed previous reports that his foundation is looking into helping build solar thermal projects in India .
The speech , which was followed by a Q&A with John Podesta , the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress Action Fund , provided some of the more innovative and forward - thinking policy ideas we ’ve heard to date .
Clinton emphasized the fact that the new clean energy economy has to deliver “ good economics , ” and if we are n’t convinced of the positive financials , we wo n’t be able to convince other countries to join us .
So what ’s the federal government ’s role in ensuring all that ?
Here are Clinton ’s top 10 suggestions : [ digg=http://digg.com/environment/Bill_Clinton_10_Things_the_U_S_Should_Do_For_Clean_Power]
1 ) . Congress must pass legislation that puts a price on carbon and establish a cap - and - trade system .
The alternative is passing a carbon tax , Clinton says , but adds that he tried that route already and it did n’t work out too well .
2 ) . We need to renew and lengthen the tax credits for clean energy .
The time frame needs to be longer than three years — more like 6 to 10 years .
That is the only way to stimulate enough production of clean energy technologies .
3 ) . It ’s important to figure out the federal government ’s role in modernizing the electrical grid , including both efficiency and carrying capacity .
The grid wastes a lot of energy moving power , given that the wind blows and the sun shines in places where a lot of people do n’t live .
Tax payers should also be able to split the cost of modernizing the grid with utilities .
4 ) . Utility decoupling should be federally mandated .
That ’s what California has done on a state level , separating its utility profits from electricity sales , and has thus become one of the most efficient energy states in the nation .
While this has been an issue for the states , Clinton says the federal government should take on this task .
5 ) . We should have legislation to accelerate replacing traditional incandescent lighting with LED lighting .
This could save us the equivalent power of a dozen power plants over the next 20 years .
6 ) . On the production side we need to continue to fund carbon capture and storage projects .
China is bringing on a new coal plant every 10 days or so , so we need to figure this technology out .
7 ) . We need to accelerate the move from corn -based ethanol to more sustainable biofuels .
The conversion ratio is twice as good , but the enzyme process is twice as expensive .
Many of the corn ethanol plants can be easily modified to produce cellulosic ethanol from the waste of farm crops .
We ca n’t continue to raise the price of food and skew production patterns .
It seems worth it to have differential tax incentives to do this right .
We should consider doing a joint investment with Brazil , potentially in the Caribbean , which would import sugar cane - based ethanol into the U.S , but it would not be subject to the tax that is placed on the rest of Brazilian ethanol .
It might not be politically feasible , Clinton added .
8 ) . We should have a program to shut down urban landfills and use them for either waste heat or fertilizer .
The green house gas coming out of landfills is methane , which is pretty bad .
“ We do a lot of work around this area with my foundation , ” he said .
Organic landfills should just not be there — it ’s bad for global warming , and it ’s a public health nightmare .
9 ) .
We need to accelerate the move to hybrid and electric vehicles and modernize our railway system .
After our party lost , Clinton said , we were succeeded by a group that thought high - speed rail was virtually closet communism .
Biofuels are also just a transition to electric and hybrid cars .
We have this electric vehicle technology today , and it ’s made in America .
The technology would probably require larger tax credits , but it would be worth it because the prices for electronics would immediately drop — think the iPhone or a flat - screen TVs .
10 ) .
We need to demonstrate to the rest of the world that this is not an affectation for rich countries — that this is as big an opportunity for developing counties as it is for wealthy countries .
The most popular thing the U.S. has done is its work with AIDS and Malaria , including work done by the Gates and Clinton Foundations .
We need to also use this model for what we could do for clean energy development in the developing world .

Apparently it ’s not enough that Libertarians need 12 times more signatures to get on the Pennsylvania ballot .
It ’s not enough that the Republican authorities did all they could to keep Ron Paul out of the primary debates .
The McCain - Feingold Incumbent Protection
Act is n’t sufficient .
Now the Republicans are so desperate they ’re resorting to a frivolous lawsuit in Pennsylvania not only wasting taxpayer ’s money but also telling 50,000 Pennsylvania voters the McCain campaign thinks their right to democracy is null and void .
Why does n’t it surprise me that the Republicans are n’t even trying to hide their disdain for democracy and fairness , or even the law ?
Ca n’t they even wait for the election to start cheating ?
Last Monday Victor Stabile a Pennsylvania Republican
Party leader filed a suit in Commonwealth Court to remove Bob Barr from the Pennsylvania ballot because the Libertarians in accordance with the law , began petitioning before Barr was officially nominated and then lawfully substituted his name later .
Sean Haugh from the Libertarian Party responded to the claim with this :
“ The challenge to the substitution process is completely frivolous .
It flies in the face of extremely well - established case law , as the McCain campaign and the Republican Party know full well , and may well be dismissed out of hand by the Commonwealth Court .
The lack of moral integrity from the McCain campaign does n’t surprise me , but the sheer lameness of this tactic does .
It shows how pathetically desperate the McCain campaign is to stop Bob Barr . ”
The part that ’s particularly disgusting is that according to Ballot - access.org , Stabile appears to acknowledge that the action is perfectly legal .
However he suggests it “ crosses the line ” might “ taint the process ” .
Let me gets this straight .
A Republican Party leader decides that his personal partisanship outweighs the will of 50,000 voters sufficiently to spend taxpayer money on a frivolous lawsuit .
Talk about tainted .
The reason the Republicans are going to get spanked this November is because their candidates are tainted by having people like Stabile in their so - called leadership .
Rank hypocrisy is apparently standard operating procedure for the McCain campaign .
Here is what McCain said in his 2000 campaign when the Bush campaign tried the same thing on him .
” We all know that the Berlin wall is down . . .
People should be able to get on the ballot in states .
Everybody knows that I am a legitimate candidate .
I should be on the ballot . ”
This is n’t just sleazy , it ’s not very bright
If they lose they look stupid – as if they could look any more stupid than they already do .
If they win they energize the opposition and provide a massive public relations victory for the anti-McCain forces .
Bob Barr responded on this video .
I ’ll leave you with another quote from McCain in the 2000 election , he would , “ never consider , ever consider , allowing a supporter of [ his ] to challenge [ his opponent ] ’s right to be on the ballot in all 50 states . ”
Sure John – we believe you .

( Check out our complete collection of 100 + Abandoned Buildings , Places and Property . )
Ever see an impressive derelict structure and wonder just how a building so elegant , sizable or centrally located could be abandoned ?
There are amazing abandonments all over the world , but some may be closer than you think .
Many are even located right in the heart of major cities like New York or Los Angeles and are decades or even centuries old .
From zoos to steel mills , prisons to offices complexes and monasteries to cemeteries here are 7 abandoned wonders of the USA .
Abandoned Cemetery in New York
Rochester , New York : Built in the early 1800s , Mt. Hope Cemetery was the first munipical cemetery in the United States with graves older than the official graveyard itself .
Such famous persons as Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglas are among those buried there in everything from lawn crypts and columbariums to family mausoleums .
It seems strange , then , that the chapel at such an historically significant location would be abandoned to the elements , though it remains elegant even in its disrepair .
Abandoned Prison in Pennsylvania
Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania : Western Penitentiary is over a century old and was finally abandoned a few years back , only to be reopened a few months ago .
The site was , in a way , one of the world ’s most temporary abandonments , left in pristine condition during its period of disuse and lending itself to the surreal experience of a recently working prison for visitors .
Originally used in the 1800s to house Confederate Army war prisoners , it is now used for medium to low security containment of inmates requiring drug and alcohol treatment .
Abandoned Factory in New York
Lacawana , New York : The Bethlehem Steel Company was once the second largest steel mill in the United States .
They manufactured everything from railroad cars and bridge and building parts to World War II battleships .
After nearly 150 years in operation , the company finally declared bankruptcy less than a decade ago and has left behind a series of remarkably intact abandonments .
Abandoned Island in New York
North Brother Island , New York :
This abandoned 20 - acre island sits amazingly close to the bustling center of New York City yet is completely unused .
It was home to a hospital in the 19th Century , then housed veterans after World War II before becoming one of the first drug treatment centers for teens in the 1950s .
Corruption and failure caused the facility to close and the island has since been off limits to the public , though some urban explorers have made their way onto it anyway .
The island was also the site of an infamous shipwreck in 1904 in which over 1,000 people drowned or burned to death .
Abandoned Tech Office in California
Palo Alto , California : During the dot - com bubble , Sun Microsystems experienced incredible growth and rapidly expanded in all areas including personnel , infrastructure and office space .
Sun has since had ups and downs and has streamlined their operations and few people think twice about the amazing remnant abandonments they have left behind , save for a few intrepid urban explorers .
Along with other things , the ( above ) adventurers found shotgun shells , cans of malt liquor , rows of servers and even working light fixtures .
Abandoned Monastery and School Complex
Staten Island , New York : St. Augistine ’s Monastary sits atop Grymes Hill and was once a school but now has been closed for over a half a century .
Originally built as a school for boys , it was later converted and then sat idle until purchased in the 1980s .
Each new owner , though , has since fallen into debt and the school was eventually purchased by a local college to avoid unwanted development , yet even Wagner College apparently has no plans to develop the property .
Abandoned Los Angeles Zoo Site
Los Angeles , California : The Griffith Park Zoo in Los Angeles is neither the oldest nor the newest of L.A. ’s massive animal habitats .
Though this location was abandoned decades ago it is unusually available to visitors even today .
It is n’t every day that a set of abandonments not only survives for generations but also remains available to the public as a kind of museum or window into the past .

日本IBMは2008年8月1日，同社晴海事業所内にクラウド・コンピューティング環境を提供するための施設「IBM
クラウド・コンピューティング・センター@Japan」を開設した（写真1，写真2）。「すでに稼働しているクラウド・コンピューティングの施設としては，国内で始めてのものではないか」（同社担当者）という。

IBM ではクラウド・コンピューティングを「新しいコンピュータ・パラダイム。ユーザーはいつでも必要なだけのリソースを使うことができる」（米IBM IBMソフトウエア・グループ ハイ・パフォーマンス・オンデマンド・ソリューションズ担当のウィリー・チゥ
バイス・プレジデント）ものと位置付けている。
クラウド・コンピューティング・センター側にハードウエア，ソフトウエアの各種リソースを用意しており，ユーザーは必要な時期に，必要な容量だけのリソースを組み合わせたアプリケーション環境を利用できるというわけだ（）。同社はこのセンターの設備を利用して，ユーザーとともにクラウド・コンピューティングの適用分野の検討，技術検証などを進めていく考え。
具体的には，まずクラウド・コンピューティングの活用を検討する企業，組織などに向けて，無償で「クラウド・コンピューティング イノベーション ワークショップ」を開催する。参加ユーザーは日本IBMと半日間のミーティングをもち，クラウド・コンピューティングの技術的特徴をはじめ，有効な活用方法や具体的な構築計画を検討できる。ワークショップ後は必要に応じて，有償でクラウド・コンピューティング・センターでの試用や実証実験，ユーザーの課題解決の支援などを行う。
二つのアプリケーション環境を同時に立ち上げるデモ
同日に開催された記者発表では，動画によるデモが披露された。デモ内容はクラウド・コンピューティング・センターの設備を使って，二つの異なるアプリケーション環境を，ほぼ同時に立ち上げるというものだ。一つはオープンソース・ソフトウエア・プラットフォーム「
Hadoop」を利用した大規模分散データ処理環境の構築。もう一つはIBMのソフトウエア開発プラットフォーム「Jazz」を利用した，チーム開発環境の構築だ（）。
アプリケーション環境の立ち上げは，Webブラウザから指示する。ユーザーがWebブラウザ上の管理画面から，利用したいソフトウエア・プラットフォームの種類，利用日程，必要なハードウエア・リソースを指定すればよい（）。すると，クラウド・コンピューティング・センター側で指定のシステムを構築して，利用可能になったらメールで知らせてくれる。
今回のデモでは，10台程度のコンピュータを利用した二つのアプリケーション環境が，ものの数分で利用可能になった（写真6）。「100台規模のシステムを10～20分程度で構築できるので，TCOの削減が可能。Hadoopのように最先端の環境を手軽に扱えるのもメリット」（日本IBM
ソフトウェア開発研究所の岩野和生執行役員）だという。
「従来は新しいアプリケーション環境を構築する際，必要なハードウエア，ソフトウエアを用意して，パッチを提供して…といった作業に2週間程度の時間がかかっていた。クラウド・コンピューティング環境では，10分程度で簡単に環境が構築可能。ベンチャー企業や学生などが，大規模な分散処理システムを無理なく利用できる」（岩野氏）。
クラウド・コンピューティング・センターのファースト・ユーザーとして登壇した新日鉄ソリューションズ
システム研究開発センター所長 宮辺 裕氏は， 「今後，自社の顧客向けにクラウド・コンピューティングを利用したサービスを提供する可能性がある。クラウド・コンピューティング・センターを利用して，早期に技術的課題を検討したい」と狙いを述べていた。
IBM では2007年6月の米シリコンバレーをはじめに，アイルランドのダブリン，中国の北京，南アフリカのヨハネスブルグにクラウド・コンピューティング・センターを開設してきた。日本は世界で5番目のセンターとなる。「今後こうしたクラウド・コンピューティング・センターを，世界中に開設していく。数ヶ月以内には，センターの数が現在の2倍になる予定だ」（チゥ氏）。
一方で， 「 クラウド・コンピューティングにはまだバズワード的な側面がある」（岩野氏）ことも否めない。今後は，クラウド・コンピューティングの有効性や問題点をもっと具体的に詰めていく必要がある。そこで，日本IBMでは数十人の有識者を集めて，クラウド・コンピューティングの根本的な課題，政策的に調整すべき点などを検討するための会議「天城クラウド・コンピューティング・サミット」を2008年8月に開催する予定だ。

The original bronze " Lupa Capitolina " ( she - wolf ) symbol of Rome , with Romolus and Remus suckling from her teats , in Rome 's Capitoline Museums .
Some experts theorize that the statue dates from the Middle Ages , and not Etruscan times .
ROME 
She suckled Rome 's legendary twin founders and fed Benito Mussolini 's ambitious dreams of renewed imperial glories .
For centuries , the she - wolf has been one of Rome 's most powerful symbols .
But now some experts are contending that the bronze statue in a city museum atop Capitoline Hill might not be so old after all .
New theories suggest that the statue dates from the Middle Ages , and not from Etruscan times , as has long been held .
" It 's decisively medieval , " said Anna Maria Carruba , a researcher who studied the statue when she worked on its restoration a decade ago .
" As I went ahead with my research , I was ever more sure , " Carruba said in a telephone interview on Wednesday .
While medieval might sound old to modern ears , if Carruba is correct the statue would be more than 1,000 years younger than had been thought — from the 7th or 8th centuries , or even later , instead of Etruscan times .
The Capitoline Museums website says the statue , known as Lupa , or she - wolf , is from the 5th century B.C. and was donated to the museum in 1471 by Pope Sixtus IV .
Added separately , in the early 1500s , were the bronze figures of Romulus and Remus , the twin founders of Rome who legend says were abandoned on the Tiber river 's banks and survived by being nursed by the she - wolf .
The 30 - inch - high bronze is the centerpiece of a museum room named after it , and postcards and T - shirts with its image are popular Rome souvenirs .
Mussolini used the image in his regime 's propaganda pushing for a return to ancient Roman glories .
In a front - page article this week in Rome daily La Repubblica , Adriano La Regina , who for decades headed the national archaeological office for Rome , suggested that the Capitoline Museums was reluctant to release test results indicating the bronze was medieval .
" The new information about the epoch of the Capitoline bronze have been held back for about a year now from the public and experts , " La Regina wrote .
With the future — or rather , the past — of one of the city - run Capitoline Museums star pieces at stake , museums director Claudio Parisi Presicce insisted that his institution was n't trying to hide data that could subtract centuries from the she - wolf 's existence .
The data " are n't definitive yet , and we hope we can succeed in giving a definitive date " to the statue through the results later this year of carbon dating , Parisi Presicce was quoted as telling the Italian news agency ANSA .
Parisi Presicce 's office confirmed the quotes , but said he was traveling in Italy Thursday and could not be reached for further comment .
Carruba said carbon dating of bits of dirt and clay indicate the statue was cast in the 7th or 8th century A.D.
She also claimed the techniques of casting such a bronze work were developed in medieval times .
Her theory has skeptics .
Alessandro Naso , an Etruscan expert at the University of Molise , contended that Carruba 's " concluding that it is n't ancient is based on indirect proof . "
" Leaving aside the point of pride " about Rome 's symbol , " arguments for the medieval are weak , " Naso said by phone Thursday .
Archaeologist Nicoletta Pagliardi was also cautious about Carruba 's theory .
Lupa 's origins " are really uncertain , " she said in a phone interview .
Pagliardi said the statue would have likely been " manhandled " over many centuries , and so carbon dating might be testing substances that contaminated the bronze long after its creation .
Parisi Presicce , the Capitoline Museums director , said that in medieval times Rome 's symbol was considered to be a lion .
He said that weakened arguments that Lupa was made during that period .
Last year , archaeologists unveiled an underground grotto on the Palatine Hill believed to have been revered by ancient Romans as the place Lupa nursed Romulus and Remus .
Carruba said her contention that the statue is n't Etruscan takes nothing away from its mystique .
" It 's an amazing , fascinating , majestic sculpture , " she said .

If you ’re even slightly interested in utility computing — the move towards on - demand , pay - as - you - go processing platforms — then Nick Carr ’s The Big Switch is a must - read .
You may not agree with everything he says , but his basic thesis is compelling : Just as we went from running our own generators to buying electricity from the power company , so we ’re going to move from running our own computers to buying computing from a utility .
Because I spend a lot of my time writing , I ’m constantly trying to out - guess the future .
And something I ’m obsessed with right now is appliances .
Not virtual appliances , or network appliances , but simple appliances like pasta makers , bread machines , meat grinders , blenders , and so on .
If you look at the history of the electrical industry , the businesses that became interesting immediately after ubiquitous power was available were those you could plug into it .
Generators were boring ; but fans , irons , and fridges were really , really cool .
I touched on the topic back in May at Interop ( there ’s a Slideshare of the deck here on Bitcurrent . )
And I think it ’s worthy of a lot more consideration because , well , Costco had a sale on Kitchen - Aid mixers .
My wife is an extraordinary cook and an even better baker .
And she ’s long lusted after a Kitchen - Aid .
They ’re something of a cult , with a powerful motor , a custom - fit bowl , and dozens of attachments .
Most people are happy with a hand - mixer , or a whisk , but there ’s an obsessed segment of the market , the Really Serious Home Baker , full of those who simply must have a Kitchen - Aid .
So this grey , intimidating , vaguely Cylon - like appliance dominates our countertop .
The Kitchen - Aid is at its core a motor .
Its most common use is as a mixer , whisk , or dough hook .
But it has attachments that can grind sausage , make ice - cream , roll pasta , shuck peas , and so on .
It was conceived in an era where motors were expensive , and attachments were cheap .
Here ’s a great photo of a precursor to the modern Kitchen - Aid .
Today , motors are cheap .
We do n’t even think about them .
We build them into everything , which is why gift tables at weddings are festooned with single - purpose appliances .
And the Kitchen - Aid is the workhorse of near - professionals who demand a 600 - watt motor that can tug even the toughest foods into submission .
User interfaces are the modern equivalent of appliances .
Until recently , the Internet ’s user interface was a desktop computer .
Connecting to the Internet was a lot of work for a device : Network signaling , properly rendered graphics , keyboard and mouse , a display with enough resolution , and so on .
It required a dedicated machine .
The “ motor ” was expensive , the attachments were cheap .
So we put many applications on our PC : Mail , Instant messaging , games , document viewers , file storage , mapping software , videoconferencing , and so on .
But all that has changed .
We now have set - top boxes , game consoles , PDAs , cellphones , book readers , SANs — hundreds of devices , all able to access the Internet , all purpose built .
That PC in the room is increasingly the jack of all trades , and master of none .
The motor is cheap ; the attachments matter now .
There are things the PC is still best for : Workstation tasks , like graphic design or software development .
But if you want to understand the future of consumer electronics and user interfaces when CPUs are ubiquitous , consider what happened to kitchens when the motor was everywhere .
Self - powered appliances were all about convenience and portability :
You do n’t have to set up , dismantle , and clean your Kitchen - Aid every time you want to do something , and you can use an immersion blender single - handed over a hot stove - top .
In other words , while many cooks crave a Kitchen - Aid , few use it to grind their morning coffee .
We still have to deal with gadget sprawl .
Just as everyone has spare hand mixers and blenders secreted away at the back of their kitchen cupboards , so we ’re struggling with multiple devices and seeking a way to reduce them .
Certainly , high - end PDAs like the Blackberry , iPhone , Windows Mobile devices or the Nokia N95 are tackling this challenge .
It ’s also important to remember we ’re not just dealing with physical devices , we ’re dealing with information .
Having multiple blenders is n’t bad–it just wastes space .
But having multiple gadgets , each with a part of your digital life on it , is horrible .
Which is why synchronization and architectures like Microsoft ’s Live Mesh , Google Apps / iGoogle , and Apple ’s Mobile Me are so important :
It ’s not just about decentralizing the physical interface , it ’s about decentralizing the information .
When I talk with people about cloud computing and SaaS , I ’m always surprised how little mention is made of mobility and ubiquitous computing .
To me , these are as big a driver of on - demand platforms like Amazon Web Services or Google App Engine as any of the cost savings or fast development cycles that a cloud can offer .
Well that did n’t take long .
Russia ’s military incursion into Georgia , home to a key oil and gas pipeline , stoked fears that the West would have a harder time convincing Central Asian countries to defy Russia and take part in future pipeline projects that would reduce dependence on Russia .
Now , some countries seem to be bailing out of the existing ones .
Kazakhstan is considering diverting its oil exports away from the BTC pipeline that runs through Georgia , and using Russia instead .
The reason ?
“ Security concerns , ” brought ...
CHAUTAUQUA , N.Y. -- NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said it's " ridiculous " to reward untested rookies with lucrative contracts , and wants the issue addressed in contract talks .
" There 's something wrong about the system , " Goodell said Friday .
" The money should go to people who perform . "
Goodell referred to Michigan tackle Jake Long 's five - year , $ 57.75 million contract -- with $ 30 million guaranteed .
Long was the first overall draft pick by the Miami Dolphins in April .
" He does n't have to play a down in the NFL and he already has his money , " Goodell said during a question - and - answer period at the end of a weeklong sports symposium at the Chautauqua Institution .
" Now , with the economics where they are , the consequences if you do n't evaluate that player , you can lose a significant amount of money .
" And that money is not going to players that are performing .
It 's going to a player that never makes it in the NFL .
And I think that 's ridiculous . "
Goodell said he favors lowering salaries offered to rookies , but allowing a provision for those players to renegotiate their deals after proving themselves on the field .
His statement was greeted by a long round of applause from the estimated crowd of 2,000 inside the amphitheater .
Speaking to reporters before his appearance , Goodell said he plans to open negotiations with the players union on a revamped labor deal this fall .
He 's listened to concerns from all 32 owners in meetings over the past month .
" We just finished a series of one - on - one meetings with all 32 teams , where I have a better understanding and people have a better understanding of the economics each team is facing , " Goodell said .
" I think we can identify what it is we need in a negotiation to continue to make the agreement work for the NFL and for the players . "
Goodell said the key need is to have the NFL Players '
Association appreciate the financial challenges owners face with rising stadium construction costs and a faltering economy .
Those issues were not anticipated in the previous collective bargaining agreement , which provided players a 60 percent share of the league 's gross revenues .
" As our costs increase outside of player costs , that other 40 percent ... squeezes the margins and just makes it financially unworkable , " Goodell said .
" There has to be some more recognition of the costs . "
League owners , last month , voted unanimously to opt out of the CBA that was signed in spring 2006 .
The decision to opt out maintains labor peace through 2011 , but will result in changes regarding the NFL 's salary cap and contract signings if a new deal is not signed by March 2009 .
Goodell referred to next March as a deadline , but " not the end deadline , " but hoped a deal could be reached by then .
If not , teams will enter the following season without a salary cap .
While there are concerns some of the NFL 's richer teams would use their vast resources to buy up star players , there 's also a drawback for players .
Under the new rules , the time for free agency in an uncapped year would rise from four years to six and allow teams to protect one extra player with franchise or transition tags .
In addition , the two - year lag would allow many teams to extend the contracts of their most important players , maintaining the continuity that is important to winning teams .
Goodell acknowledged the NFL and its owners failed to foresee the economic issues that would face the league when the last CBA was approved .
" There have been some things that none of us could 've envisioned , " Goodell said .
" You have an economy that 's weakening .
You have aspects of the deal that we did n't realize that we were going to be building billion - dollar stadiums .
...
Things happen .
I do n't look back at it as a mistake .
I look back at it as what do we need to do going forward ? "
MSNBC :
President Bush praised Pakistan Monday as a strong ally in the fight against terrorists and as committed to securing its border with Afghanistan .[.. ]
In words meant to bolster the U.S. - Pakistan relationship , Bush said ( Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza ) Gilani has made a " very strong commitment " to securing the dangerous border region .
Gilani said he wants the people of the United States to know that vast majority of Pakistanis want peace , and want to cooperate with the U.S .
Gilani's White House visit comes amid increased calls by senior U.S. officials for Pakistan to stop militants from staging cross - border attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
Officials and state media said that missiles hit a religious school in a village just inside Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan on Monday , killing six people .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but the incident followed a series of strikes apparently by U.S. aircraft in recent months against militant leaders holed up in Pakistan 's tribal belt .

After analysis of the passenger lists of the four hijacked flights and other immigration documents , investigators identified Salem Al - Hazmi and Abdulaziz Al - Omari as two of the terrorists .
The real Salem Al - Hazmi , however , is alive and indignant in Saudi Arabia , and not one of the people who perished in the American Airlines flight that crashed on the Pentagon .
He works at a government - owned petroleum and chemical plant in the city of Yanbu .
He said yesterday he had not left Saudi Arabia for two years , but that his passport had been stolen by a pickpocket in Cairo three years ago .
Abdulaziz Al - Omari has also come forward to say he was not on the flight from Boston that crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Centre .
An electrical engineer who works in Saudi Arabia , Mr Al - Omari said he was a student in Denver during the mid-1990s , and that his passport and other papers were stolen in a burglary in the US five years ago .
He was given a special pass by the Saudi embassy so he could return home .
" The name is my name and the birth date is the same as mine , " he told Asharq al - Aswat , a London - based Arabic newspaper .
" But I am not the one who bombed the World Trade Centre in New York . "
Both men have offered to fly to the US to prove their innocence .
A Saudi embassy official in Washington warned yesterday that many more terror suspects might have been using false identities .
" The Salem Al - Hamzi we have is 26 years old and has never been to the United States , " Gaafar Allagany told the Washington Post .
" He has said he is willing to come to the United States if anyone wants to see him . "
The FBI said it was reviewing the information about those on board the flights and that " the possibility that some of the identities are in question is being actively pursued " .
The confusion has added to the problems of investigators .
They have discovered that one of the men arrested , Badr Mohammed Hamzi , a radiologist from San Antonio , Texas , regularly used the name Khalid Al - Midhar , who has been named as another of the hijackers .

As gasoline prices have increase over the last several years , many people have resorted to very creative ways to increase gas mileage .
These drivers – commonly referred to as “ hypermilers ” – try to push their car to get the best fuel economy possible , and many have been able to double their car ’s EPA estimated gas mileage .
While most of their tips revolve around driving the correct speed and making sure your car is in top shape , many of their “ extreme tips ” are dangerous and should not be attempted under any circumstance .
Here are some of the more egregious trips that you should never consider using no matter how badly you ’d like to increase your car ’s fuel economy :
Cruising through stop signs .
Rolling through stop signs will help you save gas because you wo n’t need to use as much energy ( read : fuel ) to get back up to whatever speed you ’re supposed to be traveling .
In the end , this probably wo n’t save you too much gas , and could end up costing you a lot of money .
Blowing through stop signs is a bad idea for a couple reasons .
First and foremost , it ’s against the law , and if you get caught you can expect to get a nice fine and probably a hike in your insurance premiums – which will , without a doubt , more than negate any money you save on gas .
Second , it ’s dangerous .
By running stop signs you ’re increasing the chance of hitting a pedestrian and getting into an accident .
Recommendation :
No matter how desperate you are to increase your fuel economy , I think it ’s safe to say that running through stop signs is n’t something you should be doing .
Tailgating large trucks ( think 18 wheelers ) .
Here ’s another dangerous idea that should always be avoided .
When you ’re tailgating or “ drafting ” behind a large vehicle , you ’ll increase your car ’s fuel economy because you wo n’t have to overcome as much air resistance ; in turn , you ’ll use less fuel .
When traveling closely behind an 18 wheeler , you are putting yourself in the driver ’s blind spot , meaning he or she ca n’t see you and probably do n’t even know you ’re behind them .
Obviously , part of being a safe driver is knowing where all the other vehicles around you are so that you can plan and act accordingly .
Also , the closer you drive to any vehicle , the less reaction time you have if something were to go wrong .
If you ’re only a couple of feet away from a big rig ’s bumper you ’re not going to be able to avoid an accident should the truck need to attempt to come to an abrupt stop .
Recommendation : Travel a safe distance behind all vehicles ( remember the three second rule ? ) and travel the speed limit , especially on the highway .
Shutting off your car while it ’s still moving .
This tip will help increase fuel economy because , as expected , if your car ’s engine is off , it ’s not using any gas .
This tip is often used while a car is traveling down hill , so that it can use not only the energy generated while the car was on , but energy generated from gravity as well .
It should be fairly obvious that this is an absolutely terrible idea .
If your car is off and you ’re still in motion , the chances of something bad happening are increased exponentially .
You wo n’t have the ability to quickly accelerate to get out of a tight spot ; you ’ll lose power steering , making it more difficult to turn the vehicle ; and chances are if you turn the steering wheel too far , you ’ll end up locking it in place .
While it ’s tough to pick the worst extreme hypermiling tip , this one should certainly be in consideration .
Recommendation :
When going down hills simply let off the accelerator and let gravity do its job .
Over inflating your tires .
By over inflating your tire pressure by 20 or so pounds per square inch ( PSI ) , you apparently will see a slight increase in fuel economy because you ’ll have less tire surface on the road – meaning you ’ll need slightly less energy to get the car moving and maintain speed .
However , with this decrease in tire contact with the road comes a decrease in traction and an increase in the chance you will be unable to maintain control of your vehicle .
Also , over inflating tires will make them more susceptible to blowouts and uneven wear .
Recommendation : Simply make sure your tires are inflated to the car manufacturer ’s recommended PSI .
This should be more than enough to help get better fuel economy .
While it ’s nice to increase your vehicle ’s fuel economy , it ’s not worth risking your life .
Stick to the tried , true and safe methods you ’ve heard ad nauseum over the last year or so : drive the speed limit , make sure your tires are properly inflated , use moderate acceleration , etc .
You likely wo n’t double your gas mileage this way , but you will save money at the pump while being a safe and courteous driver .
Dear EarthTalk : Should we expect to see “ plug - in ” hybrid cars anytime soon ?
I ’ve been hearing they are on the horizon but I wonder if that means in one year or 10 .
-- Bill A. , Stratford , CT
Gasoline - electric hybrids now , like Toyota ’s popular Prius , do n’t need to plug in — you just fill their tanks with gasoline and the battery keeps charged by the internal combustion engine and by energy generated from the wheels when braking ( a feature known as “ regenerative braking ” ) .
The battery then powers the electric motor when it is called into service during idling , backing - up , crawling in gridlock , maintaining speed while cruising , and for extra uphill power when needed .
As such , the electric motor is essentially a back - up engine while the hybrid relies mainly on the gasoline engine .
Plug - in hybrids take the concept further by plugging into a regular electric outlet to enable the vehicle to operate solely on its electric motor for ranges of 40 - 50 miles or more on a single charge .
This has profound implications for commuters who need only drive short distances to and from work every day and who may be able to do so solely on electric power .
The gasoline engine then becomes the supplemental one for when the car needs to travel farther than the electric engine can take it .
According to researchers at the University of California Davis , the electricity cost for powering a plug - in hybrid is only about one - quarter of the cost of powering a like - sized gasoline vehicle .
Other benefits include far fewer fill - ups at gas stations and the convenience of recharging at home .
Toyota , currently the world ’s largest producer of hybrid vehicles by far thanks to the success of its Prius , announced that it expects to have a commercially viable plug - in hybrid available to consumers as early as 2010 and is now testing prototype versions of plug - in hybrids at two California universities .
Felix Kramer of the California Cars Initiative ( CCI ) , a non-profit dedicated to promoting plug-ins , called Toyota ’s announcement “ stunning and very welcome , ” and says that these vehicles will be the cleanest practical cars on the road in a world where gas stations dot just about every intersection .
The promise of such cars , says CCI on its website , is that drivers will have a “ cleaner , cheaper , quieter car for local travel , and the gas tank is always there should you need to drive longer distances . ”
U.S. automakers are also jumping onto the plug - in bandwagon .
General Motors says that it will have mass - market plug - in hybrids — modifications of its Saturn Vue and Chevrolet Volt — on the road by 2010 .
Ford has also developed a small fleet of plug-ins , but is not yet ready to offer them to the public .
Fisker , a U.S. start - up focusing on the creation of high performance , energy efficient vehicles , plans to sell an $ 80,000 plug - in hybrid sports car by late 2009 .
Chrysler ’s Sprinter van was the first plug - in from a major U.S. manufacturer , but it is only presently available to a limited number of institutions as a fleet vehicle .
Plug-ins have also caught on elsewhere .
Chinese carmaker BYD plans to sell a plug - in hybrid sedan in the U.S. within five years .
And Volkswagen hopes to have a plug - in hybrid Golf ready to roll by 2010 .

In the LA Times ' Technology blog , Chris Gaither reports that the indictment against billionaire Broadcom founder Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III has gotten " jucier . "
One of the two indictments against the Broadcom founder that were unsealed today alleged that Nicholas put Ecstasy in the drinks of unsuspecting high - tech executives , bought prostitutes for customers of the Irvine - based chip company and both used and distributed illicit drugs , including cocaine and methamphetamines .
…
For aficionados of rich - people - being - naughty stories , there 's this delicious tidbit from the story by Scott Reckard and Kim Christensen :
The pilot of a private plane taking Nicholas and guests from Orange County to Las Vegas had to put on an oxygen mask because they smoked so much marijuana .
The partying was n't reserved for the air , the government says .
According to the story , the indictment also lists a few properties allegedly used for nefarious purposes :
An equestrian estate in Laguna Hills , where Nicholas had constructed a warren of tunnels and underground rooms , including one that contractors alleged was intended to become a secret " sex lair . "
Ruth Greenglass , whose damning testimony in the Rosenberg atomic - bomb spy case of the early 1950s helped lead to the execution of her sister - in - law Ethel Rosenberg , died on April 7 .
She was 83 .
Mrs. Greenglass ’s testimony was later called into question .
Along with her husband , David Greenglass 
Ethel ’s brother and a central figure in the case  Mrs. Greenglass had lived in the New York metropolitan area under an assumed name for more than four decades .
Her death was revealed in court papers on June 23 .
That day , in an unexpected response to a suit by historians , the federal government agreed to release secret grand jury testimony , 57 years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage .
The government , however , consented to release the testimony of only 35 of the 45 witnesses ; those who are dead or have consented to the release .
Mrs. Greenglass was listed as one of the deceased ; her death was confirmed by the United States Attorney ’s Office in Manhattan and through Social Security records .
Mr. Greenglass survives her .
The Rosenberg investigation can be traced to 1945 , when a Soviet cipher clerk , Igor Gouzenko , defected to the West and stunned intelligence officials by revealing that the Russians were engaged in extensive spying against their wartime allies .
At the time , David Greenglass was an Army sergeant assigned as a machinist to the Manhattan Project , the program to develop the atomic bomb , at Los Alamos , N.M .

As any experienced computer programmer knows , there are unwritten laws that govern software development .
However there are no penalties for breaking these laws ; rather , there is often a reward .
Following are 21 Laws of Computer Programming :
Any given program , once deployed , is already obsolete .
It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa .
If a program is useful , it will have to be changed .
If a program is useless , it will have to be documented .
Only ten percent of the code in any given program will ever execute .
Software expands to consume all available resources .
Any non-trivial program contains at least one error .
The probability of a flawless demo is inversely proportional to the number of people watching , raised to the power of the amount of money involved .
Not until a program has been in production for at least six months will its most harmful error be discovered .
Undetectable errors are infinite in variety , in contrast to detectable errors , which by definition are limited .
The effort required to correct an error increases exponentially with time .
Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capabilities of the programmer who must maintain it .
Any code of your own that you have n’t looked at in months might as well have been written by someone else .
Inside every small program is a large program struggling to get out .
The sooner you start coding a program , the longer it will take .
A carelessly planned project takes three times longer to complete than expected ; a carefully planned project takes only twice as long .
Adding programmers to a late project makes it later .
A program is never less than 90 % complete , and never more than 95 % complete .
If you automate a mess , you get an automated mess .
Build a program that even a fool can use , and only a fool will want to use it .
Users truly do n’t know what they want in a program until they use it .

It sounds like a joke .
The brother of the world 's most famous terrorist wants to build the world 's longest suspension bridge , linking two continents across the world 's most dangerous waters .
As if that 's not enough , he also plans to build two new cities – one at each end .
If Sheikh Tarek bin Laden is joking , it 's an expensive gag .
The Al Noor project will cost some $ 200 bn ( £ 100bn ) and , according to Sheikh Bin Laden 's people , he has already ploughed hundreds of millions of dollars into the scheme himself .
The project is nothing if not ambitious .
A bridge , 18 miles long , will link Africa with Arabia across the Bab al - Mandib ( Gate of Tears ) , the strait connecting the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden .
Two cities , one in tiny Djibouti , the other in Yemen , will sit at either end .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The new metropolises , the Saudi developer claims , will be the envy of the world : the finest hospitals and schools , world - class universities and sporting facilities – everything will be the biggest and the best .
Building them will require a staggering influx of migrant labour .
The Djibouti city alone needs 850,000 workers – the country 's entire population ( children and babies included ) is 800,000 .
Once built , the two cities will be models for a further 98 Sheikh Bin Laden hopes to build worldwide .
Where , he does not know .
And , judging by the grand launch in Djibouti last month , it is a question he is unlikely to ever have to answer .
An odd mix of Djiboutian government officials , American military contractors and journalists gathered in the splendour of the Djibouti Kempinsky Palace , the country 's sole five - star hotel , to watch hyperbolic promotional videos .
The project was compared to the construction of the Pyramids , the Garden of Eden and the Great Wall of China .
It would be a " hope for all humanity " .
Whereas once people from around the world dreamed of one day living in America , soon they would hope and pray for a life in Djibouti , said the company 's chief executive , Mohamed Ahmed al Ahmed .
The bridge linking the two continents would allow trade to blossom " from Dakar to Beijing " , he said , ignoring the fact that Djibouti 's best link to the rest of Africa is a 90 - year - old railway that takes two days to travel 300 miles to the nearest city , Addis Ababa .
Without new transport infrastructure on both sides of the bridge , people will not be able to travel far .
Maybe that 's just as well .
Djibouti 's neighbours are not premiere business destinations .
Ethiopia , the largest , is currently fighting three wars .
Eritrea , to the north , is one of the most closed societies in the world and is currently engaged in a small border war with Djibouti .
And then there is Somalia – a failed state and one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters .
Which makes it all the more curious that some major US companies with strong links to the Bush administration appear to be in charge of the project .
The main contractors are a firm called L3 Communications , a company which styles itself as offering " global security and engineering solutions " .
It is also one of America 's largest defence contractors and its senior staff includes retired military officials and Republican businessmen .
Sheikh Bin Laden may be the front man , but L3 seemed to be running the show .
Experts lined up to answer questions after the video screenings were all working for US firms – some were former Bush administration officials .
Even the chief executive , Mr Ahmed , has close American ties .
He previously worked for another US defence contractor , DynCorp .
And yet , despite all the hype , the project does not appear to be particularly well thought through .
No - one seemed to think it was a problem building two new cities in one of the most unstable regions in the world .
Nor did anyone think it was a problem that neither country has enough water or food for its current population – the Djibouti city will raise the country 's population from 800,000 to more than three million .
One eighth of the current population is already in need of food aid , according to the World Food Programme .
Mr Ahmed claimed these were minor problems .
Look at Dubai , Abu Dhabi and Doha , he insisted .
But those cities were built on oil money .
Neither Djibouti nor Yemen has any real income of its own .
Djibouti's main exports are re-exports – it acts as a port and transportation hub for landlocked African countries .
Yemen is the world 's leading producer of myrrh .
So far , the project has no major investors .
But Mr Ahmed said : " People will have doubts .
But we will realise our dream . "
Barack Obama thinks the government should intervene on gas prices to “ give families some relief , ” and last week called for releasing 70 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
John McCain proposes an end to the ban on offshore drilling and has pushed for a gas - tax holiday because “ we need it , we need it very badly . ”
But both candidates and the public are evidently unaware of a basic fact : Gasoline is more affordable for American families now than it was in the days of the gas - guzzling muscle cars of the early 1960s .
Prices are beginning to come down somewhat , but this was true even when the national average was at its summer peak .
Two - thirds of American voters say they think that the price of gas is “ an extremely important political issue , ” and many believe that it will cause them “ serious ” financial hardship , according to a recent survey by the Associated Press and Yahoo .
Although it ’s true that the real ( inflation - adjusted ) and nominal ( posted ) prices of gasoline are higher than at any time since World War II , even at the recent peak national average of $ 4.11 a gallon ( California ’s average Friday was $ 4.17 ) , gasoline is still more affordable today than it was during the Kennedy administration .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke worries that increasing fuel prices might eat up so much disposable income that it flat - lines consumer spending and tanks the economy .
But it ’s difficult to square that worry with what we call the “ affordability index ” -- the ratio of the average person ’s disposable income to the price of gasoline .
After studying the average yearly price of gasoline from 1949 to 2007 , and assigning the number “ 1 " to the ratio in 1960 , we found today ’s prices comparable to what they were in 1960 ( 1.35 today to 1.00 in 1960 , with a high of 3.32 in 1998 ) .
The higher the gasoline affordability index figure , the lower the price of gasoline relative to disposable income .
Consumer anger about rising fuel prices has taken a while to build because , until the last year or so , the increases could be shrugged off as natural year - to - year price variation .
Moreover , pump prices still seemed relatively cheap given increases in personal wealth .
Personal disposable income since 2000 , for instance , has increased by an average of about $ 4,800 a person .
Those very real increases in economic well - being reduced the pain of higher prices at the pump .
People did n’t notice that real gas prices were higher because the percentage of their income going to the gas station was at an all - time low until recently .
The bad news for politicians is that motorists are noticing now .
We are bombarded with reminders , from nightly newscasts to front pages , that gas is more expensive now than it was in the late 1990s .
Ask Americans the price of milk , bottled water or orange juice and many wo n’t have a clue .
But virtually every American of driving age sees the large signs proclaiming the price of gas at street corners every day , and has watched the dial on the gas pump tick up to $ 40 , then $ 60 or higher as they fill their tanks .
The bill is high , and it is drilled into our heads .
But perception is not reality where gas prices are concerned .
By June of this year , disposable income had risen by an average of $ 1,627 per person over last year ’s figures , according to the Department of Commerce , while the average person ’s real expenditures on gasoline increased by about $ 490 .
Our incomes are still outpacing gasoline price increases .
The problem is that our incomes are n’t outpacing the increase in gas prices lumped together with increases in everything else -- air conditioning , food , etc .
Our homes , meanwhile , are losing value .
But gasoline is more affordable than it was during the early 1960s , an era fondly remembered by many as halcyon days of cheap fuel and gas - guzzling American cars .
We ’re overlooking that context because it ’s easier to remember 1998 , when we saw the lowest inflation - adjusted gasoline prices in recorded history .
Politicians would do well to remember these historical facts , as well as consumer psychology , when discussing gas prices with voters .
Failure to do both will likely result in a government eager to score political points with the electorate by doing exactly the wrong thing .

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) is Australia 's Federal Government - funded public broadcaster , and has responsibilities under the ABC Act 1983 to provide services to the Australian people .
The new ABC Shop has recently launched , with downloads of TV programs made available -- but only to Windows users willing to install Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) software on their computers .
Like the BBC iPlayer , and Channel Four 's " 4OD " , ABC is using the Kontiki platform -- Kontiki uses peer - to - peer technology to deliver the show to other people , so as well as locking you into its restrictions , ABC is using your computer , and your internet connection , to distribute programs .
ABC claims it has a commitment to " respecting legitimate rights to privacy and confidentiality " , yet it is well - known that DRM is vehemently anti-privacy , and forcing Australian citizens to install proprietary , secret software from foreign corporations does not seem a good way to uphold privacy of its viewers .
We do not object to ABC charging money to download programs , only to their use of DRM .
DRM is n't necessary for enabling sustainable production and distribution of media -- you do n't have to look any further than our own guide to DRM - free living to see that plenty of artists and businesses are doing it .
Please contact ABC Online , and Senator the Hon Stephen Conroy Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy Level 4 4 Treasury Place MELBOURNE VIC 3002 Ph : 03 9650 1188 Email : minister@dbcde.gov.au

If you 're sending any emails , please CC them to us as well at info@defectivebydesign.org .
Let the ABC know you 're writing to them from Defective by Design and that you do n't want these restrictions on programs you 've downloaded !
Point out that the DRM :
locks out people who use free software .
A public service should not require citizens to install software that takes away their freedom in order to access that service .
forces ABC , a public broadcast service , to become dependent on Kontiki and Microsoft -- private , proprietary , secretive and profit - motivated corporations .
These corporations , by turning off their DRM systems , can deny people access to the media permanently .
This has already happened with Google Video , Major League Baseball , and others .
prevents citizens from making legitimate use of the media they 've funded , such as taking clips for reviews and articles , or sharing interesting programs with friends .
Thanks to Andrew for bringing this to our attention .
We try to keep up to date on as many things as we can , but we rely on readers and supporters to keep us informed and tip us off about things like this .

In The Rise of Christianity Rodney Stark comes close to asserting that the conversion of Constantine , and the progression in the 4century of Christianity becoming a state - identified cult , actually slowed the spread of the religion !
Stark 's thesis is obviously derived in large part from the American experience of cult , sect and denominational rise and fall .
Historically minded readers might wonder as to the generalizable nature of a supply side rational choice model for the ancient world .
In The Barbarian Conversion the difference between the Roman and early medieval periods in terms of the spread of Christianity is rather clear and distinct , what was plausibly a " bottom up " dynamic quickly turned into a " trickle down " and fiat process ( also see Germanization of Early Medieval Christianity ) .
A comparison to the Islamic case is perhaps a good analogy for what happened across much of Europe after the fall of Rome .
When the elites in the German frontier , or Lithuania , or Russia , converted to Christianity , their nations were considered Christianized .
That is , full members of Christendom .
But the persistence of pagan practices among the populace was common , and even the newly Christian nobility often exhibited dual religious identities ( e.g. , public and international practice of Christianity combined with cryptic or local adherence to pagan seasonal rituals and sacrifices ) .
I suspect that here you have a situation wheremodels for the population might be appropriate to describing the dynamics of initially nominally Christian states .
In Iran or Al - the elites were Muslim , and the population as a whole , who were ethnically different , lagged .
From an " orthodox " Muslim perspective any state which is ruled by Muslims is by definition part of the domain of Islam ( this is the rational for reconquering Spain and India by , as these lands remain Muslim in perpetuity ) .
To some extent the Christian hierarchy seems to have taken a similar viewpoint , though there were attempts to stamp out open paganism among the peasantry , to a large extentfactowas tolerated so long as the monopoly of Christianity as the elite public religion was maintained and forms were adhered to during ritual occasions .
As I observed above , themodel as elucidated by Rodney Stark comes close to asserting that spread of religions such as Christianity is inevitable .
In One True God Stark makes this explicit.emphasizes the importance of exclusionary religions which also can assimilate outsiders in allowing for the coalescence of identity onfrontiers .
In Darwin 's Cathedral David Sloan Wilson promotes the idea that religious belief can serve functional ends in producing higher than individual left units of interest and action .
Many cognitive psychologists have observed that universal religions often result in fictive kinship .
Note here that the important point is not the propensity toward supernatural belief ; that 's modal human cognition .
Rather , it is the specific theological and institutional character of a religious organization which allows them to successfully compete with other " firms , " and if thedynamics are dominant these will result in the extinction of " weaker " religious organizations in the face of " stronger " ones over time via the choice of individual actors along the filaments of a social network .
A classic case study is the rise of Christianity and the late Roman Empire referred to above .
It seems likely that around the year 300 about 10 % of the Roman Empire 's population was Christian .
Rodney Stark would hold that the conversion of Constantine and the subsequent sponsorship of the new religion by the emperors was only illustrative of the general trend at best , and possibly even detrimental .
On the face of it this seems likely a ridiculous contention .
Could it be that paganism was actually strengthened by state sponsorship of Christianity ?
That Theodosius ' forcible suppression of pagan cults around 395 was only the outcome of the relative weakness of Christianity because of its association with the Roman state ?
Could the fact that as the 4century proceeded customary subsidies to pagan cults were shifted to the Christian Church have actually taken some of the thunder out of the triumph of Christianity ?
Stark and company point to the anemic nature of state sponsored Christianity in Europe as compared to the free market of American religious firms .
Their model is to some extent an economical one , and they hold that state enforced subsidies and monopolies do nothing but sap the vigor of any corporate entity , which the early Christian Church was to a great extent .
This particular critique is not new , even if the language borrows a bit from modern economic thinking .
Early Protestant radicals viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a corrupt corporation , and some of them even looked explicitly back to the " primitive " Church before Constantine as the model for how true religion should organize .
The descendants of this sort of outlook are numerous in American Protestantism , though the most direct heirs are the Amish who reject the contention that the world as a whole can be saved .
They are the most extreme of the Protestants who turned their backs on the concept of the Church Universal which sanctifies and saves the whole society .
But hypotheses need to be teased apart and tested .
The state sponsorship of Christianity manifested in a " soft " form between 320 and 390 , and in more explicit and exclusive form after 390 .
The subsequent identity of the Roman Empire and Christianity adds a rather large confound into themodel .
After all , though to a large extent unenforceable , the emperor Theodosius I issued edicts which bannedpractice of pagan religion .
There were also state approved destruction of pagan temples , as well as tacit elite approval of the vigilante violence on the part of radical priests .
A good analogy for those of you who are n't versed in this era of history would be the way Christians are treated in the Middle East , they are not forced to convert through direct violence , but there is certainly a general lack of tolerance for religious pluralism and moderate levels of intimidation directed at Christian practice on a day to day basis .
The ultimate result is of course emigration and conversion in the face of strong disincentives at practice of the Christian religion .
This does not show that Islam is necessarily a better " firm , " rather , state subsidy and dominant support have only expanded its operational religious monopoly .
At the end of the day state support might result in such a weakened Islam that a new religion supersedes it , but that process might not come to fruition for centuries .
Until then .... There are two cases I can think of which do not suffer from this direct confound of state sponsorship and subsidy .
The first is Ireland , where Christianity came to dominance via diffusion across the nobility in a decentralized manner .
While Ireland was being Christianized , the Roman frontier right across the Irish Sea was seeing the extinction of Romano - British Christianity aside from in enclaves in Wales .
The eventual flourishing of Ireland as a center of Christian civilization in the early medieval period is well known , so I wo n't belabor the point .
Though no doubt prominent Irish Christians favored their own religion on their own lands , it remains that this was a decentralized society so unitary fiat could not enforce Christianity from above .
In the Irish case I think it is plausible that the strengths of Christianity as a Roman religion , with the attendant associations with , was attractive for barbarian warlords who wished to integrate themselves into the international luxury

general deductive models , and an attention to contingent detail .
Britain's Cabinet Office released a sweeping report on the country 's food policy , and determined that Britons are wasting too much food .
A third of the food bought for home consumption is wasted – 6.7 million tonnes .
Most of this could have been eaten .
Wasting food costs the average UK family £ 420 a year .
Eliminating the unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions that this wasted food produces would be equivalent to taking one in five cars off UK roads .
By using 60 % of food thrown away by households , enough energy could be generated to provide power for all the homes in Glasgow and Edinburgh .
This waste is adding to the rise in food prices , the report said , in a world where food output must rise dramatically .
The report notes that , according to a report by the World Bank , cereal production needs to increase by 50 percent and meat production 80 percent between 2000 and 2030 to meet global demand .
The report noted that food waste contributes to greenhouse emissions , partly because rotting food in landfills generates methane , a powerful greenhouse gas .
The report also said that , because of problems with storage or distribution , as much as 40 percent of food harvested in the developing world is wasted before it reaches the plate .
In the foreword to the report , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that food waste is a global problem :
Recent food price rises are a powerful reminder that access to ever more affordable food cannot be taken for granted , and it is the family finances of the poorest in our society that are hit hardest when food prices increase .
But the principal food security challenge for the UK is a global one .
We cannot deal with higher food prices in the UK in isolation from higher prices around the world – attempting to pursue national food security in isolation from the global context is unlikely to be practicable , sustainable or financially rational .
Americans do not seem to be doing much better at conserving food than their counterparts across the Atlantic .
Last month ,
The New York Times cited a 1997 study from the US Department of Agriculture that found that Americans discard an estimated 27 percent of the food available for consumption , about a pound per day per person .

SoS Brunner 's Directive Contains Specifications for Proper Storage of Election System Components , Outlawing Overnight Stays with Pollworkers
But Flaws Still Exist in the New Orders for Machine Deployment ...
Steve Heller Byon 8/21/2008 , 9:40 am PT
Guest blogged by Steve Heller of Velvet Revolution
Jennifer Brunner , Ohio's Secretary of State , has issued Directive 2008 - 68 [ PDF ] entitled Voting Machine Delivery Requirements .
The directive contains storage specifications regarding temperature , humidity , dust , fire protection , and proximity of liquids .
It also makes it clear that there are to be no more election component " sleepovers " in which poll workers take home voting equipment days or even weeks before an election for so - called safekeeping .
In actuality , the " sleepovers " are an invitation to tampering and hacking .
The BRAD BLOG was the first to report on these sleepovers , truly a menace to election security , back in 2006 , and coined the phrase " sleepover , " which seems to have made its way into the national lexicon .
AP themselves used the phrase in their coverage this week of Brunner 's new directive .
As Lou Dobbs Tonight noted in 2006 following
The BRAD BLOG 's original exposé of the practice , the sleepover procedure is still used in many states and counties .
But now , at least , Ohio's Brunner has taken a step in the right direction by ordering an end to the practice .
It remains to be seen whether all of Ohio 's local election officials will comply .
However , while we applaud this latest initiative by Brunner , it looks as if it may not go far enough in at least one very important aspect ...
As John Gideon of VotersUnite.org noted , " The directive includes permission for machines to be put at polling places before election day , with memory cards installed , as long as a ' tamper evident seal ' is over the memory card . "
Problems found in the past with such seals as used in the state of California , and defeated with ease by watchdog organization Black Box Voting , do n't inspire much confidence .
But still , this is some progress , and having seen little - to - no attention paid to this important chain - of - custody issue for the machines , scanners , memory cards , and ballots , we 'll take this as a positive step , albeit an incomplete one .
The New York Times has taken note of Brunner 's directive , and the added publicity might , we hope , prompt other state election officials to follow Brunner 's lead .
So … any of the other states who are now delivering their voting machines without any security , leaving them for days and sometimes weeks at a time in poll worker 's cars , houses , and garages going to follow suit before November ?
( Yes , we 're talking to you , Florida , among others ! )
Hope so .
But p'rolly not .
And so we soldier on , hoping that America will one day return to clean , transparent , and verifiable elections .
Before it 's too late .
A new day has come and as the developers of WhatsApp have accustomed us , they ’ve released a new BETA version of this application .
In some previous articles we ’ve told you that it is very hard to keep an application as one of the top most used ones , and we ’re sure that the guys who are working on Whats App know better .
Today we will talk about the latest WhatsApp BETA version that has just been released for devices running on Android OS .
First of all , we will tell you that the latest WhatsApp BETA version for this operating system is 2.17.148 and it can now be downloaded and installed on your device .
The WhatsApp 2.17.148 APK ( installation ) file has 33.4MB , while the previous version of the application had 33.38 MB .
The difference is not that big , which clearly shows that the developers have worked on improving the stability of the application and also have worked on fixing some of the bugs and issues that they ’ve found in the previous versions of WhatsApp .
The developers are also working on some new features that they will bring to the application in the near future .
One of the rumored features is called “ Video Conference ” and it will allow the users to make video calls with two or more users at the same time .
While this feature has not been confirmed yet by the developers , we think that it will be a good addition to the WhatsApp application , which will attract many new users .
Also , soon , WhatsApp users will be able to share their data with Facebook .

Representatives of both men continue to meet in South Africa in an attempt to form a national unity government , though Mr. Mugabe ’s opponents remain deeply skeptical that he intends to share power after a bloody election campaign that included the beatings and killings of opposition supporters .
In his statement , Mr. Bush sought to offer both a carrot and a stick .
He said that the United States would offer “ a substantial assistance package ” to the impoverished and politically tumultuous country if a representative government took office , presumably without Mr. Mugabe as president .
Separately , he ordered the State Department to free up $ 2.5 million in emergency assistance for refugees and people seeking political asylum from Mr. Mugabe ’s government .
He said that the United States would continue to contribute humanitarian aid .
Arvind Ganesan , director of business and human rights for Human Rights Watch , said that the impact of the sanctions would depend on how aggressively the United States enforces them and whether other international corporations also abide by them , even if not required by law to do so .
He called that “ the chilling effect . ”
“ It signals the administration is getting frustrated by the slow reaction of the international community , ” he said .
Before Friday ’s action , the United States already imposed sanctions against Mr. Mugabe , the country ’s president for 28 years , and 129 other individuals and 35 businesses .
Those sanctions freeze all assets in banks within United States jurisdiction and prohibit Americans from trading with the individuals or businesses .
The American sanctions against Zimbabwe first went into effect in 2003 and were expanded in 2005 .
Friday ’s order added 17 more businesses , which the Treasury Department said in an unusually pointed statement were used by Mr. Mugabe and his “ regime cronies ” to “ illegally siphon revenue and foreign exchange from the Zimbabwean people . ”
US army to get its first female four - star general
A 33 - year veteran of the US military , Lieutenant General Ann Dunwoody , on Monday became the first woman to be nominated to the highest rank in the US Army , four - star general .
" This is an historic occasion for the Department of Defense and I am proud to nominate Lt Gen Ann Dunwoody for a fourth star , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a statement .
Dunwoody 's nomination has to be approved by the US Senate .
She would take over as commander of Army Materiel Command , a branch of the army that provides logistics support to tens of thousands of US soldiers stationed around the world .
Dunwoody was named deputy commanding general of Materiel Command only last week , following the retirement of Lieutenant General William Mortensen .
Army spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Anne Edgecomb told AFP the nomination of Dunwoody to the rank of four - star general was " important , considering that there are about 11 four - star generals in the army and we have a total force of 1,077,500 soldiers , " of whom 14 percent are women .
Edgecomb was unable to say when the nomination might be approved by the Senate .
" It depends on what the Senate 's schedule is , " she said .
When Russian tanks poured into South Ossetia , it was the clearest turning point in Russia 's relations with the West since the fall of the Berlin Wall : Russia not only managed to destabilise a pro-Western regime but , crucially , demonstrated to its neighbours how defenceless they are against incursions by its armed forces .
For years , the US and the EU have been looking for ways of circumventing Russia for energy , especially in the light of the controversial cuts in supply it made to Ukraine , Belarus and the Czech Republic .
The opening of the South Caucasus Pipeline ( SCP ) from Azerbaijan to Turkey should successfully enable the flow of 16 billion cubic metres ( bcm ) of gas into Europe without Moscow 's interference .
However , with Georgia being the only viable country for the pipeline to go through - as Azerbaijan is technically at war with Armenia - the current crisis showed energy majors operating in the Caucasus how tenuous their grip on resources could become should the Kremlin intervene in the affairs of its neighbours again .
The SCP was closed for a time during the latest violence .
This is of particular concern to BP , which owns 25.5 per cent of the SCP , and is already in dispute with Moscow over the status of subsidiary TNK - BP .
Nick Day , chief executive of risk consultancy Diligence , says Russia had been using its energy supply as a tool of its foreign policy and that ' the greatest threat to Western companies in the region is renationalisation in former Soviet countries , which has already been taking place in Russia .
As a result of this conflict , countries neighbouring Russia may offer oil and gas contracts to Moscow as an olive branch . '
While a spokesman for the EU commission says the situation in Georgia meant that the EU ' had no time to waste ' in dealing with energy security , the instability of the region covering the SCP threatens to scupper Europe 's policy of diversifying its energy supply , giving Russia a much stronger hand .
This is chiefly due to the undesirable nature , as Europe sees it , of the most viable alternatives - Iran , whose nuclear programme is a bone of contention , and Iraq , whose current instability is cause for great concern .
Europe has to look at the viability of projects already on the table for its long - term energy supply .
The Nabucco project takes gas from the Shah Deniz gas fields in Azerbaijan , starting from Turkey and ranging into the heart of Europe , with the potential for inputs from Iran and Iraq .
By contrast , the South Stream project starts directly from Russia , taking Gazprom gas through new EU member states Romania and Bulgaria and provides ease of access to greater resources .
Nabucco aims to provide 10 bcm of gas from 2013 rising to 31 bcm in 2021 , whereas the South Stream aims to supply 30 bcm on completion , forecast to be in 2013 .
However , the Georgian conflict has caused great damage to the viability of Nabucco .
As Charles Ebinger , director of the Energy Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution , points out , ' the South Stream project has been strengthened by the current situation and Nabucco may fall by the wayside ' .
To that extent ; ' Russia has the whip hand over Europe in terms of energy policy ' .
Ebinger reflects the thoughts of most experts .
Valery Nesterov , energy analyst at Troika Dialog , says : ' the resource base for the South Stream is stronger than that of Nabucco .
The South Stream has a head start ; Nabucco has been dealt another blow . '
Nesterov argues that any plans to supply the Nabucco pipeline from Turkmenistan are not viable as the Turkmens are already supplying around 90 bcm of energy to Iran , Russia and China .
The geographic positioning of Turkey and Russia as the only suppliers direct to the continent mean the EU 's bargaining position looks weak .
Furthermore , Turkish - Russian co-operation is proceeding at a gallop .
This was confirmed by Ankara 's silence on Georgia and comments from the Turkish energy ministry suggesting they would ' increase supplies from Russia and Iran ' in the event of a shortfall from the SCP .
Nesterov says ' deeper co-operation between Russia and Turkey is likely .
It is to both countries ' advantage . '
So the South Stream , in terms of viability , can provide guaranteed energy to Europe over the longer term , while Nabucco is beset by unresolved problems .
When the only alternatives are gas from Iran and the Persian Gulf , energy from Russia seems to reconcile Europe 's regional strategic interests with security of supply at a smaller diplomatic cost .
But it is only the lesser of two evils .
Rep. Sam Graves ( R - MO ) 's ongoing campaign against San Francisco continues to amuse :
There was some controversy last time around about whether or not " San Francisco " just means " gay " but this time I think there can be no doubt .
Perhaps his opponent will be able to get Dockers to finance a ferocious pushback .

Progressive Democrats of San Diego
Monday , August 18 , 2008
Jeeni Criscenzo
In the process of editing blogs for a book on the birth of the Progressive Movement , I ’ve come to the sobering realization that all the marches , demonstrations , forums and protests I ’ve written about in the past five years have failed to change anything of consequence .
It ’s as if no one ever warned , “ If you attack Iraq , it will be a catastrophe . ”
It ’s as if no one ever marched a million - strong , year after year , against the ongoing funding of the occupation of Iraq ; as if no one ever contacted their congressperson or senator to voice their opposition to warrant - less wiretapping , torture , rendition or off - shore drilling ; as if no one ever wrote against imprisoning Sami al - Arian , denying habeas corpus to the Gtimo prisoners , or the shredding of our Constitution .
It ’s as if scientists never proved humans are causing global warming and no one ever called for universal , single - payer healthcare .
And most upsetting of all , it ’s as if all the Democratic candidates we worked so hard to get elected in Congress , have no idea why they were elected .
Even on a local level , I see the same issues I worked against when I was campaigning three years ago , still being fought – the Sunrise Powerlink , the LEAPS project , the Mitsubishi Robertson ’s Concrete Plant , the granite quarry in Temecula .
I ’m sure you have similar issues wherever you live , and have run up against the same brick wall .
Even when you think you ’ve won , they come back and defeat you , like Blackwater has done in San Diego , and Mitsubishi Robertson has done here in my hometown of Oceanside .
It ’s hard not to feel burnt out .
It ’s almost impossible not to just throw my hands up in the air and give up .
But what ’s at stake , if we do give up , is so horrendous that we ca n’t stop now .
This goes beyond the environmental issues in my hometown ( I can always move ) or the survival of the United States ( we can just keep our heads low and adjust to living under fascism ) , or even the demise of civilization .
What is happening threatens the survival of the human species – maybe even of all life !
Against this unthinkable outcome , we must all work to our last breath .
I ’m NOT talking about working for the Obama campaign !
As terrifying as a McCain presidency is , we ca n’t waste precious time on the charade our Presidential election has become .
If we do n’t do something NOW , there might not be an election in ten weeks .
Sadly , even if we have an election , no matter how hard we work for Obama , the outcome can easily be manipulated , as it was for the past two presidential elections .
And even if Obama wins , and by some miracle he IS the courageous leader we all want him to be , it ’s unlikely he will be able to undo the damage that will be done by Bush between now and his inauguration .
Do not make the mistake of thinking that George W. Bush is a lame duck .
He is going full speed ahead with his agenda , unhampered by anything so trivial as worrying about reelection .
Carol Wolman , Congressional candidate for CA Dist 1 ( Green Party ) , recently sent me the following list of what Bush has done in the past couple of weeks !
Gutted environmental protection by taking EPA scientists out of the loop .
Pushed for offshore oil drilling
Made it easier for the FBI to investigate without a warrant .
Proposed making oral contraceptives harder to obtain .
( & classifying them as abortion ! )
Gotten obviously drunk at the China Olympics , embarrassing the US and insulting the Chinese .
Started a proxy war with Russia via the US client nation of Georgia
Signed an agreement to place missile defense in Poland , evoking a Russian threat against Poland .
Canceled joint military exercises with Russia , essentially restarting the Cold War with the second nuclear superpower .
Sent a huge armada to blockade Iran , which could start WW III .
I was dismayed to read in an email from someone going to Denver for the Democratic Convention , how she was anticipating all of the parties she will be attending there .
I pray that while going from one festive event to the next that she notices the demonstrations planned outside – particularly the ones calling for impeachment .
This is no time to be fiddling while Rome burns !
While most Americans are paying attention to the Olympics , the election or whatever new distraction this crowd has in store for us , the final nails are being hammered into our collective coffin .
The Bushies do not plan to go softly into this dark night .
They are orchestrating the end of life as we know it , with the hubris to think they will end up ruling the world .
They are Nero on steroids !
There seems to be only one way to halt the catastrophic actions this administration has planned for the coming weeks .
We must force this cuckold Congress to begin impeachment hearings !
Conyers has called back the members of the Judiciary Committee to investigate Ron Suskind ’s revelations that the Bush administration forged “ evidence ” of the WMDs in Iraq .
But the Judiciary committee cannot enforce subpoenas as long as Bush can reassure witnesses that he will pardon them .
Introduce the possibility that the President can be impeached and his promises of pardons suddenly become worthless .
As long as Nancy Pelosi continues to block impeachment , John Conyers and his committee are impotent .
I do n’t know why this woman , this mother and grandmother , is single - handedly sealing the fate of humanity , by blocking our only hope to stop the disasters this administration has in store for us .
I do n’t care if she ’s afraid for her life , or her family , of if she ’s afraid her complicity in allowing torture will be revealed .
The excuse that there is not enough time to impeach is meaningless – the point is to START impeachment .
Whatever Pelosi ’s reasons , she MUST be convinced that the consequences of not impeaching far outweigh any rationale for blocking it .
She must be convinced to start impeachment hearings now .
Is it too late to impeach ?
It ’s not too late to START impeachment hearings .
Even if we can’t complete the impeachment process , by starting the hearings we will put the brakes on the agenda of the administration , dissolve the power of their promises of pardon and maybe even force Bush and Cheney to resign .
Consider today ’s headlines : Pakistan ’s Musharraf steps down – Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is resigning after nine years in power , amid impeachment charges based on claims he violated the constitution .
If it can happen in Pakistan , it can happen here !
It is our responsibility , as protectors of the human race , to convince Pelosi and Congress to begin impeachment hearings now .
How do we do it ?
Sign the Kucinich Petition .
On August 1st , Congressman Dennis Kucinich delivered a petition with over 100,000 Americans calling for the President to be held accountable .
On Sept. 10th , Kucinich wants to deliver 1 million signatures to Speaker Pelosi and Congress .
Like most of you , I ’ve grown weary of signing petitions that do n’t change anything .
I do n’t know if a million signatures will have any more impact on Pelosi than 100,000 .
But I do know that starting impeachment hearings is our best hope for changing the horrible future this administration has in store for us .
If you have n’t already signed Kucinich ’s petition , it only takes a minute to do it now ( http://www.kucinich.us ) and pass this on to everyone you know .
( If you signed the original petition , there is no need to sign it again ) .

In Fact , He Criticized the Bill As ' Too Generous ' To Troops - And Did Not Even Show Up for the Vote ...
Jon Ponder Byon
8/20/2008 , 5:50 am PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
Events in the campaign this week offer a case study in how Fox " News " assists the right wing --- in this case , the McCain campaign --- to disseminate disinformation :
Monday : Speaking before the Veterans of Foreign Wars , John McCain falsely claimed credit for supporting the 21st Century GI Bill , which was sponsored by Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) and Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . ) :
As a political proposition , it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what I considered flawed legislation .
But the people of Arizona , and of all America , expect more from their representatives than that , and instead I sought a better bill .
I 'm proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military , better serves military families , and better serves the interests of our country .
In reality , the bill McCain " sought " was not Webb - Hagel , which he opposed because its tuition benefits were " too generous " to the troops .
The version he sought was a different bill that he co-sponsored , and which " in no way resembles " the bill which was ultimately passed , as noted by ThinkProgress ...
The GI Bill as approved in no way resembles McCain ’s so - called proportional proposal .
The GI Bill provides 100 percent tuition payments to those who have served 36 months in active duty , and gives 80 percent to those who have served 24 months .
By contrast , under McCain ’s proposal , a soldier would have had to serve four times as long — 12 years in active duty – to be eligible for the most generous benefits .
If McCain 's version had passed , service members would have to wait to start college until they were 30 years old or older .
In the end , McCain did not even bother to show up on June 26 to vote on the bill , which passed the Senate 92 to six .
All six senators who voted against it were Republicans .
( The only other senator who did not vote was Ted Kennedy , who had recently been diagnosed with a brain tumor . )
But McCain may have been prevaricating to the wrong crowd .
Turns out VFW leaders supported the Webb - Hagel bill :
VFW ’s deputy director for legislative affairs Eric Hilleman : The Graham - Burr - McCain plan is “ very partisan and is seen as a way to convolute the GI bill , or to slow the Webb - Hagel proposal down . ”
VFW National Commander George Lisicki : “ People are leaving after their first enlistment because they are tired of being shot at , and their families are tired of the frequent deployments …
Whether they stay in four years or 20 , we owe this newest , greatest generation the gift of education . ”
Tuesday : Fox " News " runs with the story that McCain supported Webb - Hagel :

Is the CIA responsible for the convenient death of its most recent suspect in the botched anthrax investigation ?
I wonder ?
It would n’t be the first time that a “ patsy was found just in time ” .
It is convenient that their only suspect died of an apparent suicide , before he had a chance to defend himself .
Is the case against Ivins more damning then the case was against Steven Jay Hatfill who remained “ a person of interest ” right up until the time they paid him $ 5.8 million for ruining his reputation and career ?
Had he not been so outspoken in declaring his innocence might he have been found dead by an apparent suicide ?
According to his therapist Jean Duley we have allowed a homicidal maniac to work with anthrax for at least the past 7 years , as a United States government microbiologist and vaccinologist for 36 years and senior biodefense researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) in Fort Detrick , Maryland for 18 years .
This shows either extraordinary incompetence or very excellent planning .
According to the FBI ’s own investigation Ivins the “ client ” who “ has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats , and actions . ”
Duley added that Ivins ’s psychiatrist called him “ homicidal , sociopathic with clear intentions , ”
Duley added Ivins ’ behavior had grown more alarming in recent weeks .
On July 9 , she said , Ivins showed up for a group session “ extremely agitated , out of control , ” and said he had bought a bulletproof vest and gun .
“ He proceeded to describe to the group a very long and detailed homicidal plan . . . to kill his co-workers because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges , ” she said .
Duley said several psychiatrists who treated Ivins had diagnosed him as a “ sociopathic , homicidal killer . ”
Through her therapy sessions , she added , “ I also believe that to be true . ”
If you want to commit the perfect crime , first find the perfect patsy .
What better candidate could there be then Dr. Bruce Ivins ?
If you want to rule by fear what better way then an almost invisible poison that could be anywhere .
Could this be only a part of a greater conspiracy ?
I leave it to you to ponder .

This week , we ’re talking cell phone secrets — easy - to - use services that can help you unlock the hidden powers of your phone .
I started by showing you a bunch of ways to get more for your money with cool services like Braincast and Cellfire .
But today , we ’re taking on a different kind of underused force in your phone : its ability to keep your family safer .
We ’ve seen how cell phones can be used to let other people spy on you .
This trick , though , turns the tables and lets you watch them .
Easy access
Imagine this :
You ’re at work for the day .
With a few clicks on your phone , you pull up live images of your home from every possible angle .
You see what doors are unlocked , who ’s inside , and what they ’re doing .
You check up on the babysitter trusted with your kids .
Or maybe you dial in from the road and look at images of your office to see if your staff really showed up to work when you were out of town .
Whatever the need may be , it ’s all possible — and not terribly hard to achieve .
There are a number of systems out there that can let you do this .
I ’m going to focus on the one I ’ve seen in action : the WiLife ( formerly Lukwerks ) Home Surveillance System .
A simple setup
Who would n’t want to watch their property when they ’re not around ?
A system like the one WiLife offers makes it easy .
You just set up a series of cameras , configure your account , and you ’re ready to roll .
These things operate through the electrical wires you already have , too — you just plug the cameras into the wall and plug an adaptor into your computer — so there ’s no need for any elaborate installation .
You ’re probably looking at 15 to 20 minutes tops .
Once you ’re all set up , the rest is automatic .
You dial some digits on your phone , and you ’re tapped in .
You can monitor the live feeds at your disposal , provided your phone or PDA can handle the streaming video .
But the cooler part is how the system can do the work for you .
Instant alerts
WiLife ’s alerts will watch your property and let you know any time anything changes .
If someone comes in , if a light turns on , or if any motion at all is detected , WiLife sees it and alerts you .
You set the level of sensitivity , then you can choose to get a text message , a picture message , or even a video message as soon as WiLife finds trouble .
Now , the second something happens , you know it — and you ’re watching .
Link to the law
If you do discover something amiss , the system makes it easy to alert police right from your phone , too .
And the best part :
It ’s recording it all for you , so you can pass off a single evidence file to the officers the minute they arrive .
The WiLife kits start at $ 269 ( $ 449 for a 2 - camera system ) and include the text and video messaging alerts for the life of the hardware , without any additional monthly fees or subscriptions .
From what I ’ve seen , they work pretty darned well .
Speaking of which , nice shirt .
NEW YORK ( AP ) 
Call it a sign of the times .
An unemployed banker has taken to the streets of Manhattan — wearing a pinstriped suit and an " MIT Graduate for Hire " sign draped over his shoulders .
Joshua Persky , an unemployed financial engineer , says he 'll be passing out resumes during the lunch hour all week .
On Monday and Tuesday , he promoted himself in front of the Charles Schwab building at 50th Street and Park Avenue .
Persky lost his job six months ago as an investment banking consultant .
His wife and five kids are moving to her native Nebraska while he continues to look for work in New York .

More than 1,000 people have taken part in a Spencer Tunick installation , which took place at Blarney Castle in Cork in southern Ireland .
SEE ALSO
For all users of Ubuntu , there is one area where it falls short when compared to other operating systems and that is with how it looks .
By default , the eye candy of Ubuntu is rather drab : I have never been a fan of the purple and orange colour scheme that greets a fresh installation .
Even the dark theme on Windows is a pleasure to use .
For me , personally , darker themes make it easier to concentrate and get things done .
However , like all aspects of Canonical ’s system , Ubuntu is highly customisable , and thanks to a dedicated community , there is a wealth of options users can take advantage of to spice up their desktops .
Return of the Mac
One operating system that has always looked beautiful is Apple ’s macOS .
The brand new “ Mojave ” marks the fifteenth release , and one of the most striking elements is the deep and rich dark theme that is known as a distraction - free way to put your work center stage .
The only problem is that Linux users want both the freedom of an open - source system and a modern visually - pleasing environment .
Thankfully , Gnome Look provides a number of community created themes and add - ons that can transform Ubuntu from dull to delicious !
A version of Apple ’s Mojave theme is available here , and it is very simple to install .
Installation
There are a few prerequisites that will make life a little easier , namely to install the Gnome Tweaks tool .
You can find this in the Software Center and install as normal .
With that done , go to the website above and download the following package , “ mc - os - mjv dark mode . ”
After this , extract the archive file to the “ ~/. themes / ” directory in your Home folder .
If you do n’t have a . themes folder , then press Ctrl +
H to show hidden files .
If you still do n’t have the folder , then you can simply create one .
Alternatively , you can move it into “ / usr / share / themes , ” but remember you will need to be root to copy or extract here .
Once copied , simply open the GNOME Tweak tool and change your GTK theme .
Lastly , give your system a reboot to ensure that the theme applies correctly and fully .
The Result
As you can see , once the reboot is done , Ubuntu is transformed into a dark landscape with blue highlights .
The theme is so well put together , that it will apply to system - wide applications ( if placed within usr / share / themes ) and will even alter some Snap applications .
The creator of the theme has also given other desktop environments the same love , which means XFCE or Cinnamon users can experience some Apple design .
Additional Tweaks
As a bonus , here are some additional tweaks that you can use to change icons , add a dock and the like for the entire Apple experience .
Change Icons
To change the icons , download the Cupertino icon set .
Next , you need to locate the file you downloaded and right - click to extract it .
Just as before with the theme , copy it to the “ ~ /.icons ” folder .
If you do not have this , then you can create it .
Docks
To create a dock , you first need to install the Plank application from the Software Center .
Open the Software Center , and search for “ Plank , ” then install as normal .
Should Plank not be found , you can revert to the PPA that the Docky / Plank team provide .
To install the PPA , open the Terminal , and enter the following commands .
After this you should be able to install the application with :
Next , you need to download the Mojave & High Sierra Plank Dock themes .
These can then be extracted as previously and moved to the “ ~/.local / share / plank / themes ” folder .
The final step is to right - click on the blank space within the dock and access the Plank Preferences .
If you ca n’t access the right - click , press Alt + F2 and run plank - preferences .
Within the preferences , look for the theme , and apply your newly installed theme .
What themes do you prefer ?
Do you like a darker environment or prefer a cleaner , brighter desktop ?
Let us know in the comments along with any other great themes you have found .
According to a Supercell Moderator , the Clash of Clans new update will NOT be released until May 11 , 2017 .
However , in the same forum thread , it said that this does n’t mean that it will be released on May 12 , 2017 .
In the same forum thread , the moderator has also mentioned some of the things that this update will come with and some others that will NOT come with , as follows :
There will NOT be a Town Hall level 12 ;
There will NOT be level 13 walls ;
The update will be a major and unique one ;
There will be no new hero levels ;
There will be a boat that you will need to repair in order to use it .
Well , the company has already revealed a few days ago the video with the boat and everyone knew that that it will be introduced in the game .
However , it is not sure yet what it will be used for after you manage to repair it .
We remind you that some previous rumors were suggesting that the boat will just be used to switch from a village to another , as this update will allow you to own two villages with a single account .
We think that the second village will be available once you repair the boat .
Since this update will be a major one , we think that there are more new features and options that will be added to the game .
Unfortunately , Supercell does n’t want to reveal more information about this update yet and we will need to wait a few more days until it will finally be released .
While an exact release date has not been revealed yet , we think that this update will be released sometime in the middle of the month , so it will most likely happen sometime during the next week .
Are you playing Clash of Clans ?
What new features and options would you want to be added to this game ?

In recent times , a number of high profile suspects and criminals -- from extradited gangster Abu Salem to stamp scamster Abdul Karim Telgi -- have taken the test in Bangalore .
But why Bangalore ?
And what exactly is the brain - mapping test ?
A quick guide :
What is the brain - mapping test ?
It is a test that maps the brain to reveal ' guilty knowledge . '
The brain - mapping test is done to interpret the behaviour of the suspect and corroborate the investigating officers ' observation and the suspect 's statements .
During the tests , forensic experts apply unique technologies to find out if a suspect 's brain recognises things from the crime scene that an innocent suspect would have no knowledge of .
In a nutshell , experts say the brain fingerprinting test -- as the brain - mapping test is also called -- matches information stored in the brain with information from the crime scene .
Studies have shown that an innocent suspect 's brain would not have stored or recorded certain information , which an actual perpetrator 's brain would have stored .
What is the process during the test ?
During the test , the accused is first interrogated to find out whether s/he is concealing any information .
Then sensors are attached to the subject 's head and the person is made to sit before a computer monitor .
S/he is then shown certain images or made to hear certain sounds .
The sensors monitor electrical activity in the brain and register P300 waves , which are generated only if the subject has connection with the stimulus -- picture or sound .
The subject is not asked any questions .
Who invented this test ?
American neurologist Dr Lawrence A Farwell .
An expert in brain wave science , he called his technique ' brain - wave fingerprinting ' or ' brain mapping test . '
Dr Farwell found that a MERMER ( Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted Electro Encephalographic Response ) is initiated in the accused when the brain recognises information pertaining to the crime .
Why are suspects in India taken to Bangalore for brain mapping ?
India 's only forensic science laboratory that conducts brain - mapping or brain - wave fingerprinting test is located in Bangalore .
What techniques does the laboratory use on suspects ?
According to Dr S Malini , assistant director at the laboratory , they use an equipment called the ' neuroscan ' and obtain an EEG ( Electro Encephalogram ) and ERP ( Event Related Potential ) , both of which are studied to analyse the case .
" There is an in - built programme that automatically removes responses obtained due to ' tensions ' unrelated to the crime , " she says .
How accurate is the brain - mapping test ?
The accuracy rate is 99.99 per cent , says Dr Malini .
In fact , brain mapping is one of the most effective ingredients of forensic sciences these days .
In the US , it is said the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses brain - mapping tests to convict criminals .
Any examples to show that brain - mapping tests are effective ?
According to Dr Malini , Abdul Karim Telgi , the kingpin in the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam case , tested positive in the P - 300 brain - mapping test performed on him .
Telgi underwent the test last year to ascertain whether he made payments to former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal , allegedly to seek favours .
The report on the Telgi brain mapping test said : ' The major findings reported by the brain mapping tests are indicative of the possession of knowledge about the activities by Karim Telgi ; brain activation during preparation processing , while evoking primary encoding indicates active participation of Karim Telgi in all these activities . '
9 billion gallons ( and future levels ) are mandated and not based on projected total gasoline sales .
The scenario you mention of gasoline sales falling way off ( 10 % at most maybe from last year ) , would still put the total motor gasoline consumption at more than 130 billion gallons ( which includes the 9 billion gallons of ethanol ) for the year .
Thus , there is plenty of gasoline around even in this extreme case to absorb the ethanol and still not saturate the E10 market .
In fact , 9 billion gallons of ethanol means 90 billion gallons of E10 which leaves over 40 billion gallons of conventional gasoline without ethanol .
The immediate problem is not that there will be enough gasoline to absorb the ethanol in 2008 , 2009 , and probably 2010 ; in these years the questions are " Is there enough infrastructure to send the ethanol to ( and blend with gasoline in ) as - of - yet untapped regions , esp. the southeast ? " or " Will mounting political pressure over food / grain costs force the EPA to lower the mandate ? " ( witness Texas 's recent waiver application ) .
After 2011 EIA projects there will not be enough gasoline sold to absorb the ethanol as E10 ; then the big question becomes how does the U.S. absorb the excess ; as E85 ?
( currently the only legal option ) or as E15 / E20 ?
( as of yet not fully tested ) .
Can the EPA lower the mandate if the E85 infrastructure is inadequate or too costly and the E15 / E20 option is not available ?
Yes , but again this probably would not happen until after the " blend wall " ( i.e. , saturated E10 market ) has occurred .
All obligated parties ( refiners and importers of refined fuel products ) must satisfy their " renewable volume obligation " ( RVO ) which is essentially their share ( based on how much fuel they produce or import ) of the total renewable fuel that must be used ( this year 9.0 billion gallons ) .
Volumes of blended renewable fuel are assigned RINs ( renewable identification numbers ) .
If a particular party cannot blend their share , they may buy these RINs from parties that have over complied on their RVO ( though some alternatives exist such as carrying a RIN deficit for one year or using one 's own excess RINs from the previous year ) .
In any case , every year every obligated party is required to document its RINs and show that they have the same or more than their RVO to the EPA .
If they do n't , they can carry a deficit as mentioned earlier or they will be penalized by the EPA .

Mr Ahmadinejad has said several times he is serious about negotiations Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he is serious about nuclear talks - one day after saying he would not retreat " one iota " on the issue .
And in a televised address he made no mention of the latest international efforts to halt Iran 's activities .
Iran was given a 14 - day deadline expiring on Saturday to agree to freeze uranium enrichment in return for no further sanctions - but made no reply .
Analysts say his comments seem to have restored deadlock in the nuclear talks .
Mr Ahmadinejad told the televised press conference : " We are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results .
" We hope that other sides are serious too . "
But the BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran points out that Mr Ahmadinejad also insists Iran is not willing to back down over its nuclear programme - so it is not clear what any negotiations would involve .
Timeline denial
The Iranian leader was speaking after a two - day meeting with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad - who had earlier promised to use his ties with Iran to help resolve Tehran 's nuclear stand - off with the West .
But Mr Assad told a news conference : " I am not a mediator nor an emissary , and was not asked to deliver any message by any Western official . "
He said the nuclear issue had featured in their meeting , but gave no further details .
Tehran has claimed consistently that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes , but the US and its allies believe it could be used to develop a nuclear weapon .
Iran was set the informal deadline to agree to suspend its uranium enrichment after its chief nuclear negotiator met officials from the UN , EU and the US in Geneva on 19 July .
In return , the international powers said they would impose no further sanctions on the country .
But Iran has made no public response to the offer - and officials were quoted on Saturday denying that any such timeline had been agreed .
Analysts say the Iranian government may appear to be pressing ahead regardless with its nuclear programme , but it must also be worried that it is facing steadily - growing international isolation .

What are these ?
ARE YOU AFRAID OF SUCCESS ?
A SURPRISING NUMBER OF TALENTED PEOPLE ARE .
TO FIND OUT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM , TAKE OUR QUIZ ON PAGE 110 .
THEN TAKE HEART .
THE DREAD OF DOING WELL IS ROOTED DEEP IN THE UNCONSCIOUS , BUT YOU CAN OVERCOME FEAR OF SUCCESS .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) – " An amazing day .
Amazing .
I do n't know how it happened .
He had played so great .
It was the strangest turn of events I 've ever seen .
I feel so sad for him . "
So said Nick Faldo about Greg Norman , while wearing the green jacket that everybody , including Faldo , had assumed was finally going to be Norman 's at Augusta this year .
The man is a mystery .
Far and away the biggest moneymaker in pro golf , he wins and wins and wins -- until he gets to a major tournament .
At the Masters , he took a six - stroke lead and the next day , in just five holes , handed his six strokes and then some to the guy behind him .
He 's done this not just once , not twice , but over and over and over again .
If you 're a fan and did n't send Norman a fax , you 're apparently in the minority .
" We have thousands of faxes here , so many thousands we have n't counted them all yet , " says Frank Williams , Norman 's manager and friend .
" People worry about him .
Some of these faxes have tearstains on them . "
What is it about Norman that is so riveting ?
Maybe we recognize in him something of ourselves .
In a world that seems determined to sort out winners from losers , he is that terrible enigma : a gifted loser , a player who clearly can win but , when the stakes are highest , somehow hamstrings himself .
It almost looks as if he 's doing it on purpose .
And yet , how could he ?
You do n't have to be a sports fan to see the parallels between golf and business .
The same phenomenon is far from rare in corporate life : the talented person , with everything going for him or her , who self - destructs for no reason that anyone can fathom .
Some of these tales -- and everybody knows a few -- are as spectacular in their own way as Norman 's , although they mercifully are n't broadcast live via satellite around the world .
Robert Meuleman , president and CEO of Amcore Financial in Rockford , Illinois , tells of a bright young banker with a solid marriage who , shortly after his promotion to the presidency of a division , began an affair with an employee , whom he then knocked down a flight of stairs .
" We do n't know why he destroyed himself that way , " says Meuleman , who fired him .
" His career has never recovered . "
Then there 's the executive at Union Pacific in Pennsylvania who , despite his $ 500,000 - a- year salary , claimed lavish business outings with imaginary customers on his five - figure expense reports .
" Even after he was spoken to , he kept doing it , " says another Union Pacific executive .
" In fact , he did it more . "
He too was fired .
You 'd never be so reckless , you say ?
Probably not .
But hold on .
Most often , being your own worst enemy is a far more subtle thing .
You 're in line for a promotion you 've worked toward for years , and suddenly find you can't get to work on time .
Or you start losing your temper in meetings with higher - ups where cool is the rule .
Or you somehow misplace the data for a client presentation that could make or break your team .
Or maybe you have n't made any obvious blunders , but you have n't been doing your best work for quite a while now , and you do n't know why .
Any of these examples may share a common cause : fear of success .
It 's strange to think , at a time when so many people are struggling just to hold on to what they 've got , that fear of succeeding could be much of an issue or do much damage .
It is and does .
" Fear of success is a terrible problem in this culture , " says Brian Schwartz , a psychologist and consultant in Greenwich , Connecticut .
" The vast majority of people I see are afflicted with it . "
What is so treacherous about this anxiety is that the people who suffer from it most acutely are usually not aware they have it .
Those who do know are not eager to own up in print , at least not by name .
In an ever more Darwinian business world , an admitted weakness is a dangerous thing .
The dread of doing well in life is rooted deep in the unconscious .
Nobody deliberately sets out to wreck his or her own career .
And people are so adept at rationalizing their own mistakes , or misinterpreting those of others , that fear of success can be hard to distinguish from , oh , let 's see , incompetence , arrogance , inattention , burnout , or any of the 101 other gremlins that can send a career into a tailspin .
Often fear of success shows up in the exceptionally talented as a long pattern of underachievement , of schlubbing along in the same old rut .
" People who have an unconscious fear of success wo n't set ambitious goals for themselves , so they achieve far less than they 're capable of , " says James O'Connell , a psychologist at the outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin .
" And this is the tragedy of it , because ultimately it stops people from getting what they really want or even from asking for help . "
If this is an unconscious fear , how can you tell if you have it ?
Shrinks have been studying the problem since 1915 , when Freud wrote an essay called " Those Wrecked by Success . "
He noted the " surprising and even bewildering " tendency of some people to fall apart " precisely when a deeply rooted and long - cherished wish has come to fulfillment ... as though they were not able to tolerate happiness . "
As with the Illinois bank president , a spate of self - destructive behavior - - often involving drinking , drugs , sex , or all three -- immediately before or after a major triumph is a dead giveaway .
Says Elissa Sklaroff , a therapist in Philadelphia who treats success - fearing executives : " Being on the brink of success brings a crisis , and all of our neuroses pop right up to the surface .
On some level , success - fearing people are running from change -- especially from having to change their secret self - image as an unsuccessful or undeserving person . "
Sometimes , Sklaroff says , people about to take a big step up in their careers become convinced , without any medical evidence , that they have a grave illness , usually cancer .
Ever watch Seinfeld ?
Remember the episode where Jerry and George have finally sold the pilot of their TV show to NBC , and George starts believing that a tiny white bump on his lip is a deadly malignancy ?
" God wo n't let me succeed ! " he shouts at his pals .
" He 'll kill me first ! "
Donnah Canavan is a psychology professor at Boston College , a practicing therapist , and co-author of a textbook called The Success - Fearing Personality ( from which the quiz on this page is adapted ) .
For 15 years she 's taught a course on this subject ; many of her classes are full of business people .
" I keep expecting to run into some skeptic who'll say , ' Fear of what ?
Oh , come on , ' " says Canavan .
" But I never have .
Everybody seems to know exactly what I 'm talking about . "
That 's probably because , at one time or another , most of us have had occasion to ask , What was I doing ?
Maybe you once procrastinated until a crucial deadline sailed by , or inserted foot firmly in mouth at the worst possible time , or had one cocktail ( or was it six ? ) too many at the office Christmas party , or showed up inexcusably late for a big job interview - - well , hey , nobody 's perfect .
Over time , though , too many of these missteps should be telling you something .
" Self - defeating behavior feels , to the person doing it , like an accident or like bad luck .
And of course there are such things , " says Lenora Yuen , a therapist in Palo Alto who specializes in treating the chronically self - sabotaged .
" But after a while you may notice a pattern of ' accidents , ' a whole run of ' bad luck . ' " Warning lights should flash .
Likewise if you , or someone you know , has been stuck in the same job despite obvious talent .
" Often people who fear success do succeed , eventually , " says Canavan .
" But it takes them longer than they or their peers may have expected .
They get less far .
And it causes them a lot more mental turmoil and emotional pain than it does someone else to get to the same level . "
Where does all this angst come from ?
Ah .
Please lie down on the couch , get comfortable , and we will proceed .
Freud postulated an unconscious need to fail ( not just a desire , but a need ) that arises from the unresolved competition between parent and child -- mainly father and son -- for the approval of the opposite - sex parent .
Because a child cannot distinguish between thinking or wishing something and actually doing it , he is afraid to express , even to himself , his rage at his father , for fear that his father will die .
So he represses his anger , which in the murky brew of the unconscious alchemizes into guilt .
One of the inconvenient features of the unconscious mind -- call it a design flaw -- is that it has no sense of time .
Something that occurred there once , with traumatic effect , will keep on happening -- is still happening -- 30 or 40 years later .
By this reasoning , success in any competitive realm is a blood sport .
Beating one 's father , vanquishing the primal foe , is , in the complex metaphorical world of the unconscious , an unspeakable act .
It is not merely murder , but patricide .
( And all this time you thought you just wanted the three - window office and stock options . )
This is why , according to Freud , some men feel terrible unease at the prospect of getting ahead in business , in sports , or anywhere else .
It 's guilt .
Today 's shrinks acknowledge that , compelling as Freud 's theory is , most fear of success springs from less dramatic sources -- mostly the bad stuff that happened to you as a kid and hammered your opinion of how good you are .
" People will only achieve the level of success that their image of themselves can absorb , " says Brian Schwartz , the Greenwich psychologist .
He notes that the human species has , in the course of evolution , made a trade : a bigger brain than any other mammal in exchange for a longer period of dependence on others while that brain takes its sweet time to develop .
During the helplessness we call childhood , all kinds of psychic harm is done .
When finally an adult achieves success , says Schwartz , " that old structural damage is still there . "
Long ago , if somebody important to you -- a parent , a teacher , a sibling -- convinced you that you are n't very smart , or very competent , or very likable , or that nothing you do is ever quite good enough , you will have the devil 's own time believing that you 're capable of doing well in life or that you deserve to .
This conviction of unworthiness is rarely something people take out and examine , except in therapy .
It 's just there , lurking around the edges of life like a creature out of a Stephen King novel , spoiling everything .
People with rotten childhoods do become successful , of course , but often they can't enjoy what they 've achieved .
The archives of American popular culture ( Marilyn Monroe ) , politics ( Richard Nixon ) , and sports ( Dennis Rodman ) are crammed to bursting with examples .
Consider a recent one .
Don Simpson , co-producer of hit movies like Flashdance , Beverly Hills Cop , and Top Gun , had it made in the shade -- by everyone 's standards except his own .
Simpson died of a drug overdose a few months ago .
Shortly before his death , he said , " The degree to which you make enough money to then feel like you do n't have to make any more money is the degree to which you have to deal with something pretty interesting .
It 's called You . "
He chose not to .
David Krueger , a Houston psychiatrist , has treated some very rich go - getters who come to him because they can't figure out why they 're so miserable , and they know all too well what Simpson was talking about .
" If someone is used to feeling bad , feeling good is hard or impossible , " Krueger says .
He asks his patients how long they can stand to feel happy .
" They always know what I mean .
They say , ' Not more than a day . '
Or even , ' Not more than an hour . ' "
A childhood belief that what you are is never enough , that you must live up to others ' lofty expectations of you , can lead to a lot of self - sabotaging behavior later on at the office .
Sometimes successful people do n't want to be where they are .
They 're there because someone else - - a parent , a spouse -- expects them to be .
They can't imagine how to extricate themselves except by messing up .
If I provoke my own firing , the unconscious logic goes , I 'm off the hook .
I can get out of here , and the decision can appear to have been someone else 's .
The ex-railroad executive who partied himself right out of a job , says an erstwhile colleague who knew him well , " did n't want to be here so bad , he did n't even know how bad he did n't want to be here . "
He got his unconscious wish , but in a way far more damaging than if he'd been able to figure out his motives beforehand and leave the company on his own steam .
Even if you manage to get through childhood unscathed , along comes adolescence .
Alas , when Kurt Vonnegut remarked that " life is high school , " he was n't kidding .
Much of our grown - up self - image is formed at a time when , let 's face it , most of us are no prize .
" Does anybody not remember how godawful those teenage years were ? " asks a well - known CEO who has wrestled with a deep distrust of his own accomplishments .
" Everybody feels ugly and inadequate .
I think that as a result , a sense of peace , the idea that ' I am good enough ' eludes most of us . "
There may be many adult moments when doubts about your achievements are nothing more or less than your old high - school self coming back to nag that you 'll never be ( or date ) the football quarterback or the head cheerleader because you 're just too tall , or short , or smart , or dumb , or teeth - braced , or - - fill in the blank .
Dennis Rodman perfectly captures this vague feeling of inadequacy in his autobiography , Bad As I Wanna Be : " I was n't accepted there [ in his Dallas neighborhood ] .
I was too skinny , too ugly , too something . "
The trouble with teenage self - loathing is that a severe case of it may make you spend the rest of your life with a chip on your shoulder -- or to put it in shrinkspeak , suffering from a compensatory disorder .
This can be a dandy way to wreck a career .
Steven Berglas , who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and specializes in treating fear of success in executives , tells of a CEO who is very short and who has been self - conscious about it ever since he was ruthlessly razzed back in high school .
As part of a lifelong campaign to prove his masculinity , this CEO started sleeping with a board member 's wife .
Yes , that 's right .
Out of all the women in the world , he got mixed up with the wife of a member of the only group of people with the power to fire him .
And sure enough , they did .
" Compensatory disorders use success as a vehicle for masking or suppressing old traumas , " says Berglas .
" Succeeding -- being CEO - - ca n't fix or cover up a painful feeling of inadequacy .
You have to deal directly with the feeling itself and put it behind you , or it will sabotage you . "
Few things cause more fear of success than a sense that if you follow your dreams , you will betray the people who love you .
The loss of love , and of the security it engenders , is the mother of all unconscious terrors .
In adolescence , when you 're trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up , this fear can stop you in your tracks , or it can set you up for some major self - defeating stuff if you pursue your ambitions in spite of it .
Pete Hamill , an accomplished journalist and fiction writer , tells in his memoir A Drinking Life of growing up in a working - class Brooklyn neighborhood where factories were closing , the good life was moving to the suburbs , his own dad 's job had been relocated to Georgia , and " in the daytime , there were more men in the bars , drinking in silence and defeat . "
Hamill 's father urged him to learn a blue - collar trade , but he wanted to be a writer .
He feared it was an arrogant wish : " ' Who do you think you are ? ' some collective voice from the Neighborhood called to me .
' Who the hell do you think you are ? ' "
It turned out that Hamill was exactly who he hoped to be : a talented guy who went far .
But as a kind of penance he drank too much for years , often " in the company of friends who thought they were failures and I was a success .
Who could accuse me of snobbery , a big head , deserting my friends , if I was just another bum in the men's room throwing up on his shoes ? "
Getting drunk , he writes , " was a way of saying I would never act uppity , never forget where I came from . "
Meanwhile , whole decades flashed by in an alcoholic blur .
Eventually Hamill realized that despite his feelings of guilt about leaving , he did n't owe the Neighborhood an early death from cirrhosis -- or even one more hangover -- and he quit drinking altogether .
Not everybody in his situation does .
Psychiatrists say that excessive drinking and fear of success are often closely linked , especially in people with one or more alcoholic parents .
Through everyone 's past , whatever the individual circumstances , flow the cautionary tales of Western civilization .
If you have any ambivalence about getting ahead , these stories will reinforce it .
They have a way of sinking into the unconscious and lying in wait like old banana peels for the unwary to slip on .
The ancient Greeks came up with the notion of hubris -- provoking the wrath of the gods by acting godlike -- and illustrated it with , among others , the story of Icarus , who flew too close to the sun on his wax wings and plunged to his death in the sea .
The Judeo - Christian tradition echoes with similar warnings , from the Tower of Babel and the injunction that pride goeth before a fall to the New Testament idea that it 's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into Heaven .
And look at some of the most enduring characters in literature and film : the Great Gatsby , a rags - to - riches golden boy who ends up dead in the swimming pool behind his mansion .
Or Citizen Kane , as rich as , well , William Randolph Hearst , on whom the character was based , but who dies friendless and heartbroken amid his collected treasures .
It 's no accident that some of the most popular TV shows -- Dallas , Knots Landing , Dynasty -- have been soaps about unhappy rich people .
As a culture we love the idea of hitting it big , but we also fear and distrust it .
Some scholars maintain that Elvis 's fantastic , almost mythic , popularity is so enduring because it ties together powerful and contradictory elements in the American , and perhaps especially the Southern , psyche :
Yes , you can come from a humble background and become a huge star , but you will pay a tremendous price .
The bitch goddess success , as William James called it , in the end will kill you .
If this all seems too abstract , consider a specific case .
A New York media executive was taught in Bible school as a small child that money and power are evil .
He has enjoyed a thriving career despite occasional fits of self - sabotage .
But he refuses to handle cash , which he says is dirty .
When you go through a tollbooth with him , he makes you hand the money to the attendant and take the change , even if he 's the one driving .
And whenever things are going particularly well at work , this fellow develops a stubborn ( and medically mysterious ) rash on his hands .
Cultural archetypes that equate success with isolation are so persuasive that in some highly accomplished people they become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Says Bill Morin , who recently left Drake Beam Morin to start two new businesses : " I was always envious of my parents , and they never had any money ; they lived from one paycheck to the next .
They never had a damn thing except each other .
Now I have a lot of money , but I still envy them , because as I 've gotten more and more successful , I 've gotten more and more alone .
I knew that would happen , and it did . "
This brings up a conundrum , according to psychologists who work with troubled executives ( many of whom are on their third or fourth marriages ) .
It may in fact be lonely at the top -- but perhaps only if you insist on it .
People who fear they will end up alone often bring it upon themselves .
They may actively shut out their nearest and dearest , usually with work as the pretext , and allow old friendships to wither from neglect .
The generation of women now in middle and upper management has had to grapple with the same personal and cultural aspects of fear of success as their male peers -- plus a few marked Women Only .
Long before there was anything like Take Our Daughters to Work Day , girls were routinely taught that being too capable , too smart , or too ambitious would make them unfeminine , unlovable , and unmarried .
The primal fear of abandonment , of success as a road map to loneliness , hits women hardest of all .
Obliged to choose between success at work and fulfillment after hours , some women consciously or unconsciously choose the latter .
Conscious choice is a wonderful thing -- the Holy Grail of therapy .
It 's where the shrinks separate the neurotic from the normal .
If you decide you really do n't want to scale the corporate or professional heights , good for you , as long as you know what you 're doing and why .
Jill Natwick Johnston , a trademark lawyer at Stroh Brewery in Detroit , just turned down a far better job at another company to spend more time with her 8 - year - old twins than the new position would have allowed .
The decision was n't easy .
" It 's a job a lot of people would have killed for , " says Johnston .
" But I decided it 's not worth it if it 's going to kill you . "
Economist Juliet Schor , author of The Overworked American , discovered last year in a survey of 1,000 men and women that 28 % had downshifted -- that is , voluntarily accepted a lower income and less stress to do a better job at life outside the office , especially raising kids .
This is not fear of success .
Steven Berglas , the Harvard psychiatry professor , wrote The Success Syndrome : Hitting Bottom When You Reach the Top , based on years of clinical sessions with business people who needed help figuring out what success really is .
" What we call success may have consequences that you know you do n't want , " says Berglas .
He suggests that if the idea of the next promotion makes you queasy , do a cost - benefit analysis .
" Approach it as you would any other business decision , " he says .
" What are the pros and cons ?
What will you have to give up to get this ?
Is it worth it ? "
Are some losses , such as having to spend weekends in the woods with a beeper strapped to your fishing pole and a portable fax in your pack , not worth a new title and a bigger paycheck ?
If not , say , " no , thanks , " and let somebody else sweat it .
As Berglas puts it , you 're being " rational and adaptive . "
Or think about this :
Do you have the right personality and the requisite skills to take on the role of the person above you ?
If the idea of getting promoted is keeping you up nights , it may be that you ain't got the chops , as jazz musicians say , and you know it .
That 's not fear of success , it 's fear of failure , and it may be a realistic fear indeed .
Berglas believes the long - standing American career path of promoting people from technical to managerial jobs is wrongheaded for lots of reasons .
Some people have terrific technical skills but the personality type known as " empathic . "
These are folks for whom the task of controlling someone else 's fate , which is what management comes down to , is , in Berglas 's words , " stressful to the point of toxicity . "
If that applies to you , turning down the Big Management Job is no sign of neurosis ; it 's common sense .
Work keeps getting more precarious , more complex , more demanding .
The last thing you need is a jumble of unfinished psychological business to trip you up .
Before you can decide whether you 're a success fearer or a commonsense downshifter -- or neither -- and then act accordingly in your own best interest , you have to know yourself , including those parts of your psyche that you might rather ignore .
You have to like yourself too .
And that , initially , can be even harder .

The biggest ever fund set up to battle deforestation was launched today , targeting the vast Congo basin rainforest in central Africa .
Britain and Norway are providing £ 108 m and will also supply satellite imaging technology to monitor the area .
The fund is intended to provide African governments and people living in the rainforest with a viable alternative to logging , mining , and felling trees for firewood and subsistence farming .
The Congo basin rainforest is the world 's biggest after the Amazon , at about twice the size of France , but is rapidly dwindling .
It is being cut down at the rate of 25,000 football pitches a week .
Loss of trees is one of the biggest sources of the carbon dioxide warming the atmosphere , accounting for 18 % of annual emissions .
Projects will be eligible for funds if they can demonstrate that they will curb the destruction of forest , by providing alternative sources of income or energy for example .
Their effectiveness will be monitored from above by high definition cameras being made in the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in Oxfordshire , UK , due to be mounted on satellites and launched into orbit in the next two years .
" We are pledging to work together to secure the future of one of the world 's last remaining ancient forests , " Gordon Brown said at the scheme 's launch .
Britain initiated the fund and is providing £ 58 m .
" Preserving our forests is vital if we are going to reduce global emissions and tackle climate change . "
Jens Stoltenberg , the Norwegian prime minister , whose government is putting £ 50 m in the scheme over three years said the money spent was the most immediate and cost - effective way to combat greenhouse gas emissions .
Norway is spending £ 300 m a year on its global forest initiatives .
" By doing something about deforestation we can achieve a big and rapid reduction in emissions , " Stoltenberg told the Guardian .
The estimated cost of reducing emissions by halting deforestation is £ 3 per metric tonne of CO2 , compared to £ 50 - 100 a tonne for carbon capture schemes .
Norway believes that their annual expenditure on combating deforestation could cut emissions equivalent to twice Norway 's annual total .
British and Norwegian officials acknowledge that the biggest challenge will be ensuring that the money is effectively spent .
The Congo rainforest sprawls across Cameroon , Central African Republic , the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , and the Republic of the Congo .
Across large swaths , particularly in the DRC , corruption is rife while mining and logging companies are prepared to offer large rewards to communities and regional authorities to open up their forests .
" We know the technology .
Everyone knows how not to cut down a tree , " Stoltenberg said .
" The big challenge is the institutions , the framework , the monitoring and the control .
I do n't believe that is easy but that cannot prevent us for trying .
[ Otherwise ] we wo n't have any chance of reaching the reductions we need to avoid serious global warming . "
The new Congo Basin Forest Fund will be co-chaired by Wangari Maathai , a Kenyan environmental activist and Nobel Peace laureate , and Paul Martin , a former Canadian prime minister .
Maathai said the scheme was an example of " carbon justice " by which industrialised countries responsible for global warming entered into partnerships with those suffering its effects or those being asked to sacrifice their own economic development in the interests of the planet .
" Africa has to make very tough choices and she has to feed herself .
But it 's very important we do not sacrifice indigenous forests for biofuels or any other alternatives , " Maathai said .
Warmer temperatures and longer dry spells have killed thousands of trees and shrubs in a Southern California mountain range , pushing the plants ' habitat an average of 213 feet up the mountain over the past 30 years , a UC Irvine study has determined .
White fir and Jeffrey pine trees died at the lower altitudes of their growth range in the Santa Rosa Mountains , from 6,400 feet to as high as 7,200 feet in elevation , while California lilacs died between 4,000 - 4,800 feet .
Almost all of the studied plants crept up the mountain a similar distance , countering the belief that slower - growing trees would move slower than faster - growing grasses and wildflowers .
This study is the first to show directly the impact of climate change on a mountainous ecosystem by physically studying the location of plants , and it shows what could occur globally if the Earth 's temperature continues to rise .
The finding also has implications for forest management , as it rules out air pollution and fire suppression as main causes of plant death .
" Plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges , and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better , " said Anne Kelly , lead author of the study and a graduate student in the Department of Earth System Science at UCI .
" The only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate . "
The study appears online the week of Aug. 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Kelly and Michael Goulden , Earth system science professor , studied the north face of the Santa Rosa Mountains , just south of Palm Desert near Idyllwild , Calif .
In the past 30 years , the average temperature there rose about 2 degrees Fahrenheit .
While overall precipitation increased , the area experienced longer periods of drought , specifically in 1987 - 1990 and 1999 - 2002 .

They decided to study the area after learning that people who live and work there were speculating that climate change was causing the plants to die .
Kelly and Goulden began with a 1977 plant survey by researcher Jan Zabriskie that cataloged all plants along a five - mile vertical stretch through the desert scrub , pinyon - juniper woodland , and chaparral shrubland and conifer forest .
The UCI scientists went back to the same spot in 2006 - 07 and did another plant survey , in which they stretched a measuring tape along the route and physically identified and measured plants that covered the tape .
Then with a computer , they compared their results with those of the 1977 survey .
In the UCI study , 141 different species were identified along the tape , but the final analysis focused on 10 that were most abundant at different elevations .
Those species included white fir and Jeffrey pine trees ; golden cup oak trees ; sugar bush , California lilac , Muller scrub oak , creosote bush , ragweed , and brittle bush shrubs ; and agave plants .
The mean elevation of nine of the 10 species rose , with an average gain of 213 feet .

" I was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was , " Goulden said .
" It is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change . "
The scientists say air pollution did not kill the trees or cause the shift because the area does not have unusually high carbon dioxide levels , and they did not observe the characteristic speckling on plants caused by ozone damage .
Also , if it was pollution , all of the plants would be suffering , not just the ones at the bottom of their range .
Fire suppression also is not a culprit , they say .
The fire regime there is normal , with the last major fire occurring in the 1940s .
" The plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in , " Kelly said .
" But they have stopped recovering and now are dying , which these plants should not be doing . "
A study published recently in the journal Science also found that plant growth ranges are moving upward in a French mountain range , but its conclusions were based on historic databases , not a systematic , repeated measurement of plant cover .
The UCI study also found that all types of plants , from pine trees to ragweed , moved up a similar distance , not just small , short - lived plants as found by the French scientists .
The UCI study was funded by NASA , the U.S. Department of Energy Program for Ecosystem Research and a National Science Foundation CEA-CREST fellowship .
Kelly conducted her research as a graduate student in the CEA - CREST program at California State University , Los Angeles .
As shown in the graph here , this is an example of a general
phenomenon .
All species suffer population collapse or species extinction if they overshoot and degrade the carrying capacity of their ecology .
In the process , the article moves on to talk about how humanity is in a similar trajectory and how humanity is vitally dependent on oil for it 's current way of living .
Source : http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3188
The article also talks about my other favourite ' fantasy ' which I 've always wanted to come true but I know its just pollyannaish to expect it to come true : Singularity .
Sure , sure - humanity 's acts of intelligence are awesome .
What on earth can invent a GPS and the Internet ?
A lot of my friends to whom I talk about cite incidents that have happened in the past - the 1973 oil crisis , the 1979 oil crisis , the threat to Ozone depletion , the food shortages post WWII and how humanity had overcome all these issues .
One thing I 'd just like to point out is that the first two oil issues were temporary unavailability of oil due to nations withholding supplies .
Secondly , during all these other issues that needed technological advancement , cheap oil came to the rescue .
Now , when oil becomes expensive and unaffordable and at the same time when food production becomes a difficulty due to lack of oil / petrochem and other componded issues of our population 's demand , I doubt if the energy needed to ' tackle ' this technologically will ever be supplied by the tiny slice of renewable energy sources options at hand .
The manager of the Bureau of Land Management ’s environmental impact study , Linda Resseguie , said that many factors must be considered when deciding whether to allow solar projects on the scale being proposed , among them the impact of construction and transmission lines on native vegetation and wildlife .
In California , for example , solar developers often hire environmental experts to assess the effects of construction on the desert tortoise and Mojave ground squirrel .
Water use can be a factor as well , especially in the parched areas where virtually all of the proposed plants would be built .
Concentrating solar plants may require water to condense the steam used to power the turbine .
“ Reclamation is another big issue , ” Ms. Resseguie said .
“ These plants potentially have a 20 - to 30 - year life span .
How to restore that land is a big question for us . ”
Another benefit of the study will be a single set of environmental criteria to weigh future solar proposals , which will ultimately speed the application process , said the assistant Interior Department secretary for land and minerals management , C. Stephen Allred .
The land agency ’s manager of energy policy , Ray Brady , said the moratorium on new applications was necessary to “ ensure that we are doing an adequate level of analysis of the impacts . ”
In the meantime , bureau officials emphasized , they will continue processing the more than 130 applications received before May 29 , measuring each one ’s environmental impact .
While proponents of solar energy agree on the need for a sweeping environmental study , many believe that the freeze is unwarranted .
Some , like Ms. Gordon , whose company has two pending proposals for solar plants on public land , say small solar energy businesses could suffer if they are forced to turn to more expensive private land for development .
The industry is already concerned over the fate of federal solar investment tax credits , which are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress renews them .
The moratorium , combined with an end to tax credits , would deal a double blow to an industry that , solar advocates say , has experienced significant growth without major environmental problems .
I suppose reading tea leaves or lines on your palm is pretty strange too , when you think about it , but these take the cake .

I ’ve noticed some people who should know better claiming that bringing up Gov. Palin ’s troopergate scandal is tantamount to making a victim of or defending her slimeball ex-brother - in - law who allegedly once used a taser on his stepson .
That ’s awfully foolish .
So I thought I ’d put together a post explaining why .
The person in question is state trooper Mike Wooten — Palin ’s ex-brother - in - law who ’s embroiled in a bitter custody and divorce battle with Palin ’s sister .
Back in the second week of August , well before Palin became a national political figure , TPMMuckraker was reporting on this story .
And as part of the reporting we tried to get a handle on just how bad a guy Wooten was .
Most people who are familiar with the ugliness that often spills out of custody and divorce cases know to take accusations arising out of the course of them with a grain of salt unless you know a lot about the people involved .
And if you look closely at the case there are numerous reasons to question the picture drawn by the Palin family .
Regardless , we proceeded on the assumption that Wooten really was a rotten guy because the truth is that it was n’t relevant to the investigation of Palin .
Let ’s review what happened .
The Palin family had a feud with Wooten prior to her becoming governor .
They put together a list of 14 accusations which they took to the state police to investigate — a list that ranged from the quite serious to the truly absurd .
The state police did an investigation , decided that 5 of the charges had some merit and suspended Wooten for ten days — a suspension later reduced to five days .
The Palin ’s were n’t satisfied but there was n’t much they could do .
When Palin became governor they went for another bite at the apple .
Palin , her husband and several members of her staff began pressuring Public Safety Commissioner , Walt Monegan — a respected former Chief of the Anchorage police department — to can Wooten .
Monegan resisted , arguing that the official process regarding Wooten was closed .
And there was nothing more that could be done .
In fact , during one of the conversations in which Palin ’s husband Todd was putting on the squeeze , Monegan told Todd Palin , “ You ca n’t head hunt like this .
What you need to do is back off , because if the trooper does make a mistake , and it is a terminable offense , it can look like political interference . ”
Eventually , Palin got fed up and fired Monegan from his job .
( Palin claims , not credibly , that she fired Monegan over general differences in law enforcement priorities . )
This is an important point .
Wooten never got fired .
To the best of my knowledge , he ’s is still on the job .
The central bad act was firing the state ’s top police official because he refused to bend to political pressure from the governor and her family to fire a public employee against whom the governor was pursuing a vendetta — whether the vendetta was justified or not .
Soon after this , questions were raised in the state about Monegan ’s firing and he eventually came forward and said he believed he ’d been fired for not giving in to pressure to fire Wooten .
After Monegan made his accusations , Palin insisted there was no truth whatsoever to his claims .
Nonetheless , a bipartisan committee of the state legislature approved an investigation .
In response , Palin asked the Attorney General to start his own investigation which many in the state interpreted as an effort to either keep tabs on or tamper with the legislature ’s investigation .
Again , very questionable judgment in someone who aspires to be first in line to the presidency .
The Attorney General ’s investigation quickly turned up evidence that Palin ’s initial denials were false .
Multiple members of her staff had raised Wooten ’s employment with Monegan .
Indeed , the state police had a recording of one of her deputies pushing Monegan to fire Wooten .
That evidence forced Palin to change her story .
Palin said that this was the first she ’d heard of it and insisted the deputy was n’t acting at her behest , even though the trascript of the recorded call clearly suggested that he was .
( Hear the audio here . )
Just yesterday , Monegan gave an interview to the Washington Post in which he said that not only Palin ’s aides , but Palin ’s husband and Palin herself had repeatedly raised the Wooten issue with him and pressured him to fire him .
And now he says he has emails that Palin sent him about the matter .
( In an interesting sidelight , that may end up telling us a lot , Monegan says no one from the McCain campaign ever contacted him in the vetting process . )
The investigator appointed by the state legislature began trying to arrange a time to depose Gov. Palin last week — in other words , in the final days before her selection .
So let ’s put this all together .
We rely on elected officials not to use the power of their office to pursue personal agendas or vendettas .
It ’s called an abuse of power .
There is ample evidence that Palin used her power as governor to get her ex-brother - in - law fired .
When his boss refused to fire him , she fired his boss .
She first denied Monegan ’s claims of pressure to fire Wooten and then had to amend her story when evidence proved otherwise .
The available evidence now suggests that she 1 ) tried to have an ex-relative fired from his job for personal reasons , something that was clearly inappropriate , and perhaps illegal , though possibly understandable in human terms , 2 ) fired a state official for not himself acting inappropriately by firing the relative , 3 ) lied to the public about what happened and 4 ) continues to lie about what happened .
These are , to put it mildly , not the traits or temperament you want in someone who could hold the executive power of the federal government .

I mean , there are always iPhones and Apple logos and Steve Jobs in the Photoshop Contest entries , but this week it felt like 90 % of them had that in there .
I 'm not saying do n't reference Apple , but I will say the ones without an Apple reference got preference for inclusion in the Gallery of MS Paint Champions so the whole thing was n't all focused around the same " Apple as Overlords " joke .
Food for thought for future contests .

A 19 month Philadelphia boy , who was found dead inside a suitcase , was starved by religious group members , including his mother because he would n't pray after meals .
Three members of the cult called 1 Mind Ministries and the toddler 's mother were charged with first - degree murder .
The investigation revealed that Javon Thompson , almost 19 months old died in his mother 's arms after he was not fed since December 2006 .
Police found the suitcase with the remains of the child in April 2007 , after they received confidential information .
According to court documents , members of religious group did not seek for medical care , letting Javon die of hunger .
Ria Ramkissoon , 21 year old mother of the child was placed in psychiatric ward of Baltimore 's Central Booking and Intake Centre , where she remains until the bail review will take place .
Three other members of the religious group - Queen Antoinette , 40 year old , Marcus Cobbs , 21 and Trevia Williams , 21 were kept in custody after the arrest in May in NY .
Steven Bynum , another alleged member of the cult has not been arrested yet .
Ramkissoon 's family claims that their daughter was a victim and could not control the situation .
Seeta Khadan - Newton , the mother of Ramkissoon is convinced that her daughter was not allowed to feed the baby by the group members .
The grandmother of the boy sued for custody of the child after the religious group leaders did not let her contact the daughter since April 2006 .
Two school - age children , who were taken away from the cult , told police that Javon was not fed by members of the groups since December 2006 , because he refused to say " amen " after meals and was considered by others as " a demon " .
Queen Antoinette , one of the members left the child 's body in the room for more than a week , saying that " God was going to raise Javon from the dead . "
Then she placed his body in a suitcase , disinfecting it from time to time to disguise the odor from the body .
In the beginning of 2007 the religious group moved away to Philadelphia , leaving the suitcase and other luggage to a man they met while being there and then left Philadelphia for New York .

In a previous post I talked about the problems that plauge the web based Ruby applications regarding processor and memory use .
I proposed using non-blocking IO as a solution to this problem .
In a follow up post I benchmarked nonblocking vs blocking performance using the async facilities in the Ruby Postgres driver in combination with Ruby Fibers .
The results were very promising ( up to 40 % improvement ) that I decided to take the benchmarking effort one step further .
I monkey patched the ruby postgres driver to be fiber aware and was able to integrate it into sequel with little to no effort .
Next I used themonorail server ( the EventMachine HTTP server ) in an eventmachine loop .
I created a dumb controller which would query the db and render the results using the Object # to_json method .
As was done with the evented db access benchmark , a long query ran every n short queries ( n belongs to { 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100} ) .
The running application accepted 2 urls .
One ran db operations in normal mode and the other ran in nonblocking mode ( every action invocation was wrapped in a fiber in the latter case )
Here are the benchmark resultsFull resultsComparing the number of requests / second fulfilled by each combination of blocking mode and conncurrency level .
The first had the possible values of [ blocking , nonblocking ] the second had the possible values of [ 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 ] Advantage GraphComparing the advantage gained for nonblocking over blocking mode for different long to short query ratios .
Displaying the results for different levels of concurrency
And the full results in tabular formIn accordance with my expectations .
The nonblocking mode outperforms the blocking mode as long as enough long queries come into the play .
If all the db queries are very small then the blocking mode will triumph mainly due to the overhead of fibers .
But nevertheless , once there is a even single long query for every 100 short queries the performance is swayed into the nonblocking mode favor .
There are still a few optimizations to be done , mainly complete the integrations with the EventMachine which should theoritically enhance performance .
The next step is to integrate this into some framework and build a real application using this approach .
Since Sequel is working now having Ramaze or Merb running in non-blocking mode should be a fairly easy task .
Sadly Rails is out of the picture for now as it does not support Ruby 1.9 yet .
I reckon an application that does all its IO in an evented way will need much less processes per CPU core to make full use of it .
Actually I am guessing that a single core can be maxed by a single process .
If this is the case then I can live much happier if I can replace the 16 Thin processes running on my server with only 4 .
Couple that with the 30 % memory savings we get from using RubyEE and we are talking about an amazing 82.5 % memory foot print reduction without sacrificing performance .
OSCON
After years of hostility towards Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) licensing ( here and here ) Microsoft has announced the first in a series of PHP patches - and it 's using an FSF license .
Microsoft told The Reg it 's submitted a patch to the community for the ADOdb database abstraction library for PHP to add support for the PHP SQL Driver developed with PHP shop Zend Technologies .
The patch is under the FSF 's Lesser GPL ( LGPL ) .
And , in a further move towards greater support of open source , Microsoft is becoming a platinum member of the Apache Software Foundation ( ASF ) , paying $ 100,000 in sponsorship .
The move follows work between the two to support the Office Open XML file formats in Apache 's POI project .
Ramji : watching Jakarta
That work has also led to a " clarification " of Microsoft 's Open Specification Promise to re-assure POI developers that subsets and defects of the work are also covered by OSP .
Under OSP Microsoft has agreed not to assert claims against implementations of certain of its technologies .
Microsoft is also expanding OSP by adding to the list more than 100 protocols for interoperability between its Windows Server and the Windows client .
Until now , the protocols had been available under the Microsoft Communications Protocol Program ( MCPP ) that was ordered as part of Microsoft 's anti-trust settlement with the US Department of Justice .
Microsoft , though , has repeatedly landed in hot water on MCPP for failing to make the pricing and terms clear to licensees .
Sam Ramji , senior director of Microsoft platform strategy , told The Reg Microsoft is moving from participating in open source to becoming a contributor .
Ramji , who made the announcements at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) Friday , promised " a lot more " PHP patches in the coming months now Microsoft had established processes he said clarified how employees can contribute to open source .
He did not provide details of the new policy , but El Reg reported reported on Microsoft 's new guidelines last month .
It would seem employees can contribute to projects but open source code cannot be used in Microsoft 's products , to protect the company from unwanted licenses and IP claims .
The PHP SQL Driver does not ship with Microsoft software and must be downloaded .
Microsoft 's new love for FSF licensing and PHP is not exactly unselfserving .
The decision to work on PHP fits with the overall strategy of improving the language 's interoperability with Windows and stemming the loss of PHP application deployments to Linux .
LGPL allows code to be used with proprietary programs - such as SQL Server - unlike its GPL cousin .
Also , while Ramji stressed support for ASF did not represent a move away on the web server from IIS , it is a recognition of the rival Apache HTTP Web Server 's enduring number - one status on the web and Microsoft 's desire to have it run on Windows instead of Linux servers .
Also , in a measure of how far it's willing to contribute , Microsoft does not appear ready to have its engineers actually participate in open source groups , such as Eclipse .
" Putting members in to Eclipse may or may not happen , " Ramji said .
He noted , though , Microsoft is keeping an eye on what it can do to help ASF's Jakarta Project . ®
Nearly a year ago I wrote Getting Involved with Perl 6 .
There were quite some changes in Perl 6 land in the mean time , so I thought I 'd give you a little update - both in terms of progress and how you could help today .
Pugs
pugs is n't actively developed anymore , due to lack of contributors .
The last commits to pugs itself were the attempt to compile it with GHC 6.8.* , which actually broke the build .
If you happen to be an ambitious hacker with some Haskell background , feel free to revive it .
If not - bad luck .
The last revision known to build with GHC 6.6.1 is r19915 if you feel like compiling it first ;-)
Update : since writing this post audreyt actually fixed build and install via the cabal package manager ( which is Haskell 's CPAN - equivalent ) with GHC 6.8.2 .
Details are in the INSTALL file in the pugs repository .
She also announced that pugs development will continue once GHC - 6.10.1 is out .
Parrot and Rakudo
The Perl 6 implementation on parrot is now called Rakudo , and is improving fast .
Rakudo is actually quite fun to hack .
I wrote a few small patches , and got very good feedback from the other developers .
It has solid testing ( about 700 passing tests from the official test suite , plus a few sanity tests ) , and is written in an interesting mix of languages :
Perl 6 rules for the parser , NQP ( " Not Quite Perl 6 " , a subset of Perl 6 ) for the parser actions , and PIR and C for builtins .
If you do n't like one or more of these languages , you can still find tasks that involve only one of them .
One of the next larger goals is to enable the writing of builtins in Perl 6 itself , so once that 's done it will be even more fun to hack .
KindaPerl6 and smop
KindaPerl6 , short kp6 is nearly bootstrapped , but it turns out that the bootstrapped version is painfully slow .
So ruoso started a new C based " virtual machine " called smop .
Unlike parrot it is focused on meta object programming , supporting natively different object systems and different representation for objects of the same type .
Work on kp6 has temporary stalled , but now ruoso received a grant for advancing smop programming and using it as a kp6 backend .
ruoso would be happy about any contributor with some C knowledge , or interest in the fundamentals about object oriented programming .
New Kids on the Block
There are two new approaches at Perl 6 compilers , both of which live in the misc sub dir of the pugs SVN repository and are disussed on #perl6 on irc.freenode.org .
Elf
Mitchell Charity has started another Perl 6 compiler called elf .
It is based on a ruby translation of the Perl 6 standard grammar STD.m , and everything else is a bootstrapped Perl 6 compiler with a Perl 5 backend .
Other backends are being discussed too .
If you like hacking in < perl5 perl6 ruby >. pick ( 2 ) , join # perl6 and poke mncharity or pmurias .
Update : Elf also has a homepage now
yap6
diakopter started yap6 , " yet another perl 6 " as an experiment in recursive descent grammars ( inspired by Dominus ' " Higher Order Perl " ) , towards mutable grammars for Perl 6 .
It can't parse a very large subset of Perl 6 at the moment , but if you 're interested in continuation style parsing , this the project to get involved with .
Other Projects
My area of largest contribution is currently the Perl 6 test suite , which is converging towards an implementation independent , large ( but mostly tame ) beast .
There 's a Google Summer of Code project running to enhance and improve the test suite , but the task is so vast that any additional help is appreciated , and we 're in no danger of running out of work for our gsoc student ;-)
There 's also a non-technical project for helping Perl 6 : Conrad Schneiker took action to raise funds for Perl 6 development .
I do n't know if the recent success is based on his work , but in any case it is a very good thing to do , and one that many programmers do n't feel qualified or assigned to .
If you have buisness skill and some time to spare , this might be a good place to help us .
Check out the fundraising wiki page for more details .
P.S. I hope I did n't confuse too many names .
People tend to use their nick name on IRC and their real name on mailing lists , which sometimes makes it hard to map these two if they are unrelated .
If you are mentioned in this meditation in the wrong way , please just / msg me , I 'll fix it ;-)
Update : small typos , and a few additional details suggested by Auzon ++

Petraeus endorses book that slams ' non- believers ' in the military David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 22 , 2008
Print This Email This
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann noted on Thursday that " General David Petraeus ... has endorsed a book written by an evangelical Lutheran chaplain in the US Army , in which the chaplain claims non-believers can lead to ' failure ' in their military unit . "
A dust jacket quote from Petraeus says the book " should be in every rucksack for those times when Soldiers need spiritual energy . "
The Petraeus endorsement came to light earlier this week , when Mikey Weinstein , the founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) , noticed an ad in a military paper for the book by Army chaplain Lt. Col.
William McCoy , Under Orders : A Spiritual Handbook for Military Personnel .
A MRFF representative called Petraeus 's endorsement " a slap in the face from the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq to the 21 % of the men and women fighting there who define themselves as atheists or having no religious preference ... a reprehensible betrayal of all of the non-theists who are putting their lives on the line for our country with every bit as much bravery and dedication as their religious comrades . "
Weinstein himself stated , " General Petraeus has , by his own hand , become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist Christian religious predation , via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both Christian supremacy and exceptionalism . "
Olbermann , however , appeared most offended by the violation of military regulations by the man whose name is currently being floated as a possible John McCain vice - presidential pick .
" How about army regulations against promoting religion , against proselytizing ? "
Olbermann asked .
" General Petraeus , who never has been troubled by Army regulations , nor Constitutional ones , claims that when McCoy asked him for a recommendation , he did n't give him to publish it , that it was only intended for McCoy personally . "
Petraeus has claimed he " never knew " his comments were being his comments were being seen publicly .
However , as Olbermann points out , " Petraeus 's endorsement has been on that book jacket since the book was published last year . "

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an inquiry into whether several eBay users , including the Sacramento lawyer who almost sold a colorful abstract painting for $ 135,805 after putting it up for sale for 25 cents , committed fraud by bidding up the prices of one another 's online auction offerings .
Donald Vilfer , a supervisory special agent in the F.B.I.'s Sacramento office , said the bureau turned its attention to the case after reading a June 2 article in The New York Times .
That article outlined how Kenneth A. Walton , the Sacramento lawyer , and several other eBay users had engaged in cross - bidding on one another 's items and offered glowing testimonials to each other on the eBay site .
Mr. Walton has denied operating in concert with others .
The bureau 's office in Sacramento has been watching the episode since last month , when eBay voided the sale and suspended Mr. Walton for bidding on his own painting , whose price had skyrocketed on speculation that it might be by the renowned California artist Richard Diebenkorn .
Self - bidding , known as shill bidding , is forbidden by eBay rules and is generally illegal in the traditional auction world .
Participation in a shill - bidding ring would run afoul of federal statutes prohibiting mail fraud and wire fraud ; each count could carry a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and $ 1 million in fines .
The Good News
When you use technology effectively you can begin to transform your practice in truly amazing ways .
That ’s how I was able to escape the misery of BigLaw ( where I was overworked and under - appreciated ) and start a happier solo practice .
I kept doing complex commercial litigation ( i.e. paper - intensive cases ) , but without the paper — because I figured out how to digitize , simplify , and streamline everything .
I also discovered the joys of working as much as I wanted , when I wanted , wherever I wanted .
Sometimes I had to pinch myself to make sure it was all real .
Fellow lawyers in small firms wanted to know how they could improve their practices , so I showed them .
This continued , and at this point , has been going on for well over a decade .
In that time I ’ve helped hundreds of lawyers all over the country ( and even won an ABA award , which was kind of surprising ) .
The biggest reward , though , comes from helping people achieve a kind of happiness they never thought possible .
As you can tell from these first - hand accounts …
“ My practice has grown exponentially … ” — Stephanie Quigley
“ My biggest sensei in starting my solo law practice was Ernie Svenson . ” — David Sparks
“ I learned how to develop systems to make my practice more efficient and profitable . ” — Christine Senne
“ I ’m a true believer .
You are showing lawyers how to transform their small firm practices in a way I do n’t see anyone else being able to do . ”
– Todd Smith
“ I received so much help in planning my solo firm and saved so much time not having to find answers on my own . ” — Carlee Gonzales
“ I ’m a 65 - year - old dinosaur attorney of 38 years , enjoying your online course and finding it helpful . ” — Michael R. Jarman
“ Loved it !
Practical steps and tools to implement right away . ” — Kristie Cross
“ I ’ve followed you since early 2015 when I paid for a download of your ‘ PDF essentials for Lawyers . ’
My law firm ’s “ Bible ” that I created years ago came from reading one of your blogs .
And , after attending your recent virtual Bootcamp , I learned even more and feel reinvigorated . ” — Jimmy Go
“ I ’m a new attorney less than a year out .
You ’ve helped me streamline my practice and learn to focus on a niche area of practice . ”
— Kenneth Bordes
“ It is clear that you love helping people ” — Catherine Fairchild
Here ’s the thing …
I really do enjoy helping people , especially lawyers who find themselves yearning to tap the full power of modern technology .
Now , although technology creates some amazing new opportunities , here ’s …
The Bad News
For many lawyers , the promise of modern technology has been an empty one .
And it ’s easy to understand why .
We simply were n’t prepared to deal with all this techno - wizardry .
Computers and web - driven change arrived quickly and created a massive disruption in the legal profession .
And while computers are now indispensable , they ’re also inherently complicated to operate .
So , not surprisingly , we often find ourselves feeling overwhelmed , frustrated , and confused .
Of course , not all lawyers struggle with technology .
Some of us have been able to leverage digital systems effectively .
And those kinds of lawyers are generally happy in their practices .
But most lawyers are n’t happy .
Most battle just to keep up with routine emails .
Which is a shame , because …
Learning how to deal with technology does n’t have to be so difficult .
And you do n’t have to figure it all out by yourself .
In fact , that ’s why I created my …

It has no crime , full employment , cheap housing ... and is owned by the lord of the manor .
So is this the perfect English village ?
Aside from the cows , there is n't much in the way of traffic here .
There is a bus service , but it comes only once a week and goes as far as the bright lights of Blandford Forum .
If you find yourself here for no reason , you are well and truly lost .
The traditional cliche for pretty little villages such as this is ' sleepy ' .
But there 's nothing bleary - eyed about the Dorset backwater of Chettle .
This is a village which defies every statistic and market trend .
It has zero unemployment .
Its businesses are booming .
It has no problem with outsiders buying up second homes - because they are simply not allowed .
Rents are way below the market rate .
Chettle :
Is this the perfect English village ?
This is the village the credit crunch forgot .
Young couples are not driven out by property prices and there are as many children ( 22 ) as there are pensioners .
Everyone knows everyone and crime is virtually non-existent .
The last intruder was driven off by a lady pensioner with a pick - axe handle .
So what is Chettle 's secret ?
The answer is enough to make a sociologist or a Labour MP weep .
For the past 1,000 years , this entire village and all the land around it - every last square inch of it - have been owned and controlled by the lord of the manor .
And that is just how everybody likes it .
Before World War II , many landed estates owned entire villages .
But death duties and demographics changed all that .
Today , it is thought that there are fewer than a dozen villages still wholly in private hands - Edensor and Tissington in Derbyshire , Heydon in Norfolk and a handful in the West Country .
Chettle is particularly interesting , though , because it owes its survival to the determination of a few strong - minded women .
And now , after spending the best part of 1,000 years in blissful obscurity , it suddenly finds itself the subject of a new book , The Enduring Village .
So I have come to explore this pretty backwater to see how a Victorian squirearchy survives in the 21st century .
But I do not find any forelocks being tugged .
Indeed , if there was a contest to find Britain 's perfect village , this one would have to be a strong candidate .
' I suppose you could call it benevolent feudalism .
It certainly works and long may it last , ' says John Sansom , 64 , a tenant farmer who runs the same 300 - acre dairy farm in Chettle that his father ran before him .
' The Bourke family owns this place and no one has a problem with that , because if it was n't for them , most of us would n't be here . '
Like any village of a certain age , Chettle has a rich history of colourful characters , ups and downs , feuds and illicit liaisons ( one former squire was a clergyman with three illegitimate children ) .
The Manor House : Chettle House is owned by Peter Bourke
But the similarities between Chettle and most other villages end there .
All over rural Britain you find the same problems in village after village .
First , the place becomes a target for retirees and second - home owners because it looks pretty .
House prices rise and the younger generation has to head for the town .
Then , since everyone has a car to get to the supermarket , the village shop shuts down and , weekends aside , a ghostly atmosphere descends .
Chettle , on the other hand , is thriving .
' We have a very simple policy : we want people living here who have a good reason to be here , because that 's what keeps it all going , ' says Peter Bourke , 41 , as we wander through the soaring hall of Chettle House , the magnificent Queen Anne mansion which stands at the heart of the estate .
It was Peter 's great - great - aunt who saved this place from ruin and his grandmother who saved it all over again .
His aunt still runs the 1,200 - acre estate , while Peter and his wife , Fiona , run the house .
In due course , Peter will inherit everything .
But he is determined to run it all like the women before him .
' It 's marriages that have saved this place , ' he explains .
Since the mid-19th century , Peter 's family - ' a perfect combination of lawyers , bankers and smugglers ' - have controlled the village because they have owned every one of the 42 farms , cottages and flats here .
And because the rents are a fraction of those charged by the other landlords in these parts , people are queuing up to become tenants .
Here , a pretty three - bedroom thatched cottage costs around £ 60 a week .
On the open market , the same property would command £ 300 a week .
But it 's not just a question of joining a housing waiting list .
Priority for a home goes to anyone who works in the Chettle timberyard , the Chettle farms , the Chettle village shop or the Castleman Hotel ( all owned by the Bourkes ) .
After that , priority goes to anyone whose parents or grandparents lived in Chettle .
' Some families have lived here even longer than mine , ' says 73 - year - old Susan Favre ( nee Bourke ) , Peter 's aunt .
She is the no-nonsense matriarch of the estate and general head of everything .
Chettle is full of beautiful old houses , but villagers pay only the minimum of rents
When a group of gipsies were spotted poaching in a field up the road , it was Susan who warned them off with a pick - axe handle .
They have not been seen since .
Susan chooses the tenants - and evicts them , too .
' We expect people to live here .
If they treat this place as a holiday home , then we wo n't let them stay .
People need to live here to keep the shop and the whole community going . '
Of the eight villages in this area , Chettle is the only one with a shop - not bad for a place with a population of 90 .
And it 's not just a well - stocked shop but a Post Office , too .
But much to Susan 's fury , the Royal Mail want to shut down her Post Office counter and send villagers miles away to buy their stamps .
' Everyone will have to drive .
So much for all that green rhetoric !' she snorts .
A battle plan is being drawn up .
It should be quite a battle .
Equally unusual is the tiny 14th - century church .
St Mary 's - capacity 90 - is in tip - top condition .
As lords of the manor , the Bourkes have the ancient right to appoint a vicar and they like to keep the church going .
Peter 's father , Patrick , is the current lord of the manor , but also happens to be the organist .
So the family grant a free house and telephone to a clergyman who will perform a service every Sunday .
' I originally came here for two years and , ten years later , I still can't believe how lucky I am , ' says the Rev William Johnstone , 82 , a retired missionary , as we dodge the sheep who are keeping the churchyard grass in order .
The church sits in the beautiful gardens of Chettle House with its lofty cedars , a picturesque grass tennis court and immaculate lawns .
Chettle has been owned and controlled by the Lord of the Manor for more than 1,000 years
But there is not a team of estate workers to keep it in order .
When he is not working as a solicitor in Salisbury , Peter does all the gardening , ably assisted by Fiona and sons James , seven , and Sam , one .
It looks idyllic , but it is a hard grind to keep the place watertight and in the black .
Peter and his family live in one part of the house while the rest is divided into five flats which are rented out to locals .
Fiona organises weddings , the couple belong to the Historic Houses Association and the house is open to the paying public on certain days .
Some will recognise it as a location from the 2006 period drama film Amazing Grace .
When I drop by on a weekday evening , Peter has just dashed home from work to welcome the Blandford Forum Photography Club .
Some of the visitors are a little surprised when the nice young couple serving the tea turn out to be the owners .
There is no ' them and us ' in this village .
It 's all first - name terms , whether you are a Bourke or a bin man .
' If you are a landlord , you want your tenant to feel as if they own the place , ' says Patrick Bourke , 71 , who has recently retired to a converted stable block so that his son could take over the big house .
' If you lord it over people , they wo n't respect the property - or you . '
John Sansom is a typical tenant .
' Everyone 's equal round here , ' says the widower and grandfather , sitting on the lawn of the rambling Old Rectory , which he shares with various animals , including a 23 - year - old goose called Lunch .
He bursts out laughing when I ask him if he has ever tugged a forelock .
' Look , I live in this big old house and Susan , who owns the village , lives in a cottage .
It 's a funny old place . '
' This is a brilliant community , ' says another tenant , Netta Wase .
' I do n't know what we'd do without Susan and her family . '
Back at the Castleman Hotel - formerly the estate 's dower house - business is brisk .
The place is managed by Teddy Bourke ( Patrick 's and Susan 's younger brother ) and the chef is his wife , Barbara .
The Castlesman family owned Chettle in 1903 , when the staff were pictured outside the Lodge
Her cooking pulls in a full house from miles around .
It 's a charming old place with smart new rooms and a library decorated with family crests and a pirate flag captured by a swashbuckling Bourke ancestor .
A lawyer by training , Teddy is working as the barman tonight , but he knows many of the guests like old friends .
He tells them to pour their own drinks , while he talks me through the story of Chettle and the women who have kept it going .
The village and the estate have hardly changed in size since the Domesday Book .
In 1847 , Chettle was bought by the Castlemans - a Dorset family on the up .
By the Edwardian era , it had passed down to Edward Castleman .
He preferred hunting to managing his estate , and Chettle 's fortunes were saved only by his marriage to the wealthy Jessie Morris .
When she died in 1937 , he was left childless , elderly and alone .
At the outbreak of war , his niece Esther Bourke and her young children came down to spend a few days with Uncle Edward .
' She came for the weekend .
And she never left , ' explains Teddy .
While her husband , Leslie , went off to fight in the Far East and Uncle Edward grew frail , Esther ended up running the Chettle estate through the war .
' She was a strong woman .
She was n't born to the manor and I think that 's what made her work all the harder , ' says Teddy .
Leslie Bourke returned from the war seeking a divorce , while Edward Castleman died in 1946 .
Faced with hefty death duties , the obvious solution was to sell up .
But Esther could not bear breaking up an estate she had come to love .
She auctioned off anything portable , from livestock to timber to works of art .
It was just enough to keep the estate and the village intact .
' Everyone was telling her she was mad , ' says Teddy .
' But that just made my mother more determined .
The house was virtually empty , except for the 32 buckets we put under the roof whenever it rained . '
In time , Esther pulled Chettle back from the brink and , when she died in 1967 , she left the big house to Patrick and the estate to Susan .
In due course , it will be down to Peter and Fiona and their sons to steer it into the future .
It will be a substantial challenge to keep Chettle in one piece without selling parts of the village or raising the rents to commercial rates .
And yet , Peter is determined to keep it as it is .
I point out that an estate like this , with all these houses and fertile acres , is worth at least £ 30 million .
Why go through the stress of maintaining a Victorian idyll ?
Why not play the market or just sell ?
Peter recoils , blinking in disbelief at the very thought .
' I can't imagine this place any other way , ' he says firmly .
' Everyone likes it the way it is .'
Much as it will dismay the social engineers of the modern metropolitan elite , I cannot find a single villager who disagrees .

In my last Excel Tutorial , I covered using SUMIFS and SUMPRODUCT .
Data Tables is also an advanced topic in Microsoft Excel that falls under the category of What - If Analysis .
What - If or Sensitivity Analysis is carried out to study the variation of the output to changes in the input variable .
Consider a case of compound interest , where you invest a certain amount of money in a bank deposit and the amount is compounded every year .
Formula for calculating compound interest :
A = P * ( 1 + r /n ) ^ nt
Where :
P = principal amount ( initial investment )
r = annual interest rate ( as a decimal )
n = number of times the interest is compounded per year
t = number of years
A = amount after time t
Now , if suppose we want to see what the final amount will be at different interests rates , we can quickly use a data table for the same .
Excel
Help describes a data table as :
A data table is a range of cells that shows how changing one or two variables in your formulas ( formula : A sequence of values , cell references , names , functions , or operators in a cell that together produce a new value .
A formula always begins with an equal sign ( = ) . ) will affect the results of those formulas .
Data tables provide a shortcut for calculating multiple results in one operation and a way to view and compare the results of all the different variations together on your worksheet .
Without wasting any more time on descriptions , lets get down to creating a data table for our compound interest example above .
Open a new excel file and enter the following as given in the screenshot below :
The cell B5 has the formula = B1 * ( 1 + B2 ) ^ B3
As you can see , the $ 5000 invested at 7.5 % for 5 years will give $ 7,178.15 .
Now , we will create a data table to see what amount we will receive by changing the interest rate .
Fill cells A6 to A10 with different interest rates .
I ’ve filled it with values from 6 % to 10 % .
Now , select the cells A5:B10 .
In Excel 2007 , goto Data > What - If Analysis > Data Table .
In Excel 2003 , the menu path is Data >
Table or you can use the shortcut key Alt + D + T in this order .
This will popup a window where you will be asked to enter Row Input Cell and the Column Input Cell .
Select the Column Input Cell as $ B$ 2 and leave the Row Input Cell blank and hit OK .
The values will be filled in as shown below .
You can choose to format them as currency , but that I have left it upto you .
How it works ?
Well , we did get the results , but the question remains on what just happened .
To understand this simply , the Column Input Cell is the variable whose value we are going to vary .
If supposing the data was presented horizontally instead of vertically which is our case , then you would need to select it as a Row Input Cell .
The values in cells A6 to A10 are then passed to the formula in cell B5 and the corresponding results are populated in cells B6 to B10 .
If you look at cells B6 to B10 , they contain the formula { =TABLE ( , B2 ) }
Can you try creating a Data Table using a Row Input Cell ?
Why do n’t you post your solution below or on your blog and post a link below in the comments area .
We created a One Variable Data Table .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The percentage of Americans saying they have a " great deal " or " quite a lot " of confidence in U.S. banks has fallen to 32 % -- down nine percentage points from June 2007 and 17 percentage points from June 2006 -- matching the 32 % of March 1991 and near the three - decade low of 30 % in October 1991 .
Confidence in Banking Takes a Tumble
This has not been a good year for banking given the subprime crisis , the Bear Stearns bailout , and the consumer credit crunch .
Everyone in and around banking has assumed that all of these difficulties have taken a toll on consumer confidence in the industry .
The question is how much damage has been done .
A new June 9 - 12 Gallup
Poll shows consumer confidence in banking has fallen near its lowest level since Gallup began asking this question in April 1979 .
Currently , only one - third of Americans express confidence in today 's banking institutions , comparable to the lows of 32 % and 30 % seen in March and October of 1991 , respectively .
This was during the 1990 - 1991 recession and also reflected the fallout associated with the Savings and Loan debacle of the late 1980s .
The precipitous nature of the recent decline in consumer confidence in banking is probably best reflected by how it compares to what has been happening with confidence levels in other institutions .
While confidence in banks remains above the record - low level of Congress and the low levels of many other institutions , banking has been the only U.S. institution to experience a significant drop in confidence over the past year .
Gallup has asked about confidence in institutions regularly since 1973 .
Sharp changes in the results of this question from year to year are rare , so this significant decline in confidence in banks is particularly notable .
Commentary
Given the recent negative statements and related cuts in dividends by various banks last week , it appears that the fallout from the current period of banking stress has some ways to go before it has run its course .
Gallup 's new poll shows that even before the latest revelations , consumer confidence in banking had taken a significant tumble .
While the existence of federal deposit insurance and the willingness of the Fed and Treasury to act to prevent a major financial services firm collapse have created a strong safety net for today 's depositors , the nation 's banking institutions need to be very aware of the recent plunge in consumer confidence in banking .
The squeeze on the bottom line will create significant pressure to cut expenses everywhere possible , but bank management should simultaneously be doing everything possible to reassure customers -- many of whom are older Americans -- that they place safety , soundness , and customer relationships / confidence above everything else .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 822 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted June 9 - 12 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Sir Arthur C. Clarke , legendary science fiction writer , has passed away at age 90 .
This video may have been his last message to the world .
It was uploaded to YouTube in December , and displays his enduring optimism — despite the dark cloud of failing health .
The golden age of space is only just beginning …
Space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet .
Peace was high on his mind as well .
I hope that we have learned something from the most barbaric century in history — the twentieth .
I would like to see us overcome our tribal factions , and begin to think and act as if we were one family .
That would be real globalization .
Clarke said that if he was granted three wishes , he would want : proof of extra terrestrial life , freedom from dependence on oil , and an end to the civil war in Sri Lanka .
Although he has had a diverse career in underwater exploration , space and science promotion , and communications technology the aging legend said that he would most like to be remembered as a writer .
Update : The IEEE Spectrum has published a very recent interview with Clarke .
You can listen to the audio of that meeting too .

Damage to Dams in China Leaves Millions at Risk
May 22nd , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Many dams in Southwest China sustained significant damage after the recent massive earthquake .
The Min River and its tributaries have 30 dams upstream from Dujiangyan and 16 incurred significant damage from the recent earthquake .
The Zipingpu dam is an example where a dam failure could have disastrous consequences .
Zipingpu dam threatens millions
The Zipingpu reservoir can hold a staggering 1.1 billion cubic meters of water , but the dam wall was cracked after the earthquake .
Dujiangyan , with a population of 600,000 would be devastated by a dam failure first .
Within a couple hours , water would then hit the provincial capital , Chengdu .
“ Dujiangyan would be hit first , ” says Environmental sciences professor Ai Nanshan .
“ You can imagine water levels as high as two - story buildings within 10 minutes .
Everything would be gone .
There would be no time to rescue anyone . ”
Hydroelectric Dams and Chinese Demand for Electricity
There is an increasing demand in China for electricity , meanwhile concern about global warming soars .
Although hydroelectric power seems like a good solution , the quantity , locations , and scale of such dams may not be ideal .
In addition to millions of people being displaced from the construction of dams , they also inhibited rescue efforts following the earthquake .
Soldiers could have used boats , but dams eliminated this option .
“ Here ’s the contradiction :
The country needs power for development , ” says Professor Ai , chairman of the Chengdu Urban Rivers Association .
“ You open a map of China and you see that almost all of its rivers have been dammed .
There are almost no rivers that flow naturally .

Last week , Scott Horton interviewed ( audio ) investigative journalist Joe Lauria .
Lauria was one of the co-authors of the three - part ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) series on the case of former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds for the UK's Sunday Times .
In the interview Lauria discusses the Sibel Edmonds case , the state of the US media , and the Military Industrial Complex in the context of his new book with presidential candidate Mike Gravel : " A Political Odyssey : The Rise of American Militarism and One Mans Fight to Stop It "
In the interview , Lauria says that he spoke at length to the three FBI agents who were Sibel 's immediate bosses at the FBI and that they " corroborated in general terms , that this story is true . "
Lauria describes how he recently interviewed one of the FBI agents at his home for 90 minutes , and met another of Sibel 's former bosses several times outside his house .
The agents are unwilling to provide detailed corroboration on a lot of the details in the case because they fear being sent to prison , but their willingness to speak to Lauria about the case , and their supportive statements that " She 's not crazy , " provide generalized corroboration on the case .
The FBI itself is not happy that Lauria and the Sunday Times are still looking into the Edmonds case and they made a " formal complaint " with the Sunday Times ( a British media outlet ! ) that Lauria stay away from the agents .
David Rose , author of the Vanity Fair article on Sibel 's case , and the only other journalist who has been able to speak to some of the first - hand sources - from the FBI , Dept of Justice , and Congress - in Sibel 's case , also reported how fearful his sources are :
The people that I talked to about these tapes are extremely nervous .
There is a climate in America now which is punitive towards people who are suspected of disclosing information without authorization to journalists .
The approach of the Bush administration is to punish people who come forward .
The good news is that Joe Lauria and the Times have a lot more information about the case that they have n't yet published , and are still actively investigating - 8 months after their first article was published , and 6 years since Sibel first went to Congress .
It is no wonder that the FBI is nervous and issuing formal complaints .
Case Background
Lauria gave a good summary of the nuclear black market element of Sibel 's case :
" What Sibel revealed to us , and has been revealing little by little since January , is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the US to procure nuclear designs and parts for the AQ Khan network , and it was done not through Pakistani intelligence directly , but through the Turkish embassy .
Turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to Turkish military attaches , who then turned it over to the ISI , and from there went on to the nuclear black market .
To procure these parts and designs , high government US officials helped facilitate Turkish - Israeli PhD students to get into nuclear facilities in the US , they worked with the RAND corporation as well , some moles with RAND to help get this information .
There was at least one American company , Giza Technologies , that was helping with parts , probably there were others , and this thing went on from 1995 at least until 2002 , and it could still be going on - when this operation was shut down by the Dept of Defense and the State Dept .
Now , Sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments - Defense and State - were involved in this ring .
She has named them on her website - at least , she has not named them , she has photographs of people - other bloggers have named them . "
US Media
Lauria excoriates the US media in the interview :
" Centrism is the philosophy of the American media - and that essentially backs the status quo , when you 're a centrist , and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that you 're allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then you 're transmitting these assumptions , and reinforcing every day that the US is really a functioning democracy
[...]
The mindset of the American mainstream press does not allow certain ideas to easily filter through : the idea that high - ranking US officials might actually be facilitating this ...
It 's entertainment all the time , the presidential campaign is entertainment , and do you actually think that these guys would actually go in there and make changes , whoever wins , when behind this wall of entertainment put forward by news media and the entertainment industry is a murky world of terrorism , nuclear procurement ring , of CIA , of the FBI working - and this rarely breaks through to the mainstream press ...
They rarely look at the entire system being rotten , not just one official here or there being rotten , and they pat themselves on the back .
And when I say the entire system being rotten , I mean Congress that is enthralled to corporate backers , and approving their aggressive foreign policy that enriches themselves , and does nothing to secure the American people or the interests of most American people .
That is not even in the discussion in the mainstream press , so this Boston Globe reporter was unable to conceive easily that a government official could have been involved . "
Sibel 's Comments
I asked Sibel for a comment about the interview , she replied :
Again and again you see journalists in this country who think that their job consists of nothing more than phoning the FBI press office to ask for a comment .
Only two journalists have spoken to actual first - hand sources about my case ; David Rose who is British , and Joe Lauria working for a British newspaper .
Why is it that only these two reporters were able to speak to sources at the Dept of Justice , at the FBI , and in Congress who are familiar with the details of my case ?
The agents that Joe Lauria spoke with are very familiar with all the details of the case because I worked directly with them .
Yes , it is true that these sources are very nervous about speaking out because they fear the legal repercussions , however they should n't have anything to fear , because they know that it is illegal for the government to classify anything for the purpose of hiding criminality .
As I 've been saying from the beginning , Congress needs to hold hearings and put us all under oath where we are protected so long as we tell the truth .
It is time for hearings .
All it takes is one congressman to hold hearings , or to read the classified information into the public record .
Who will stand up ?

Transcript
The following is a partial transcript of the interview ( full transcript here ) :
Horton : Welcome back to Antiwar Radio .
It 's KAOS 92.7 FM in Austin Texas .
Antiwar.com /radio .
And introducing our guest today , it 's Joe Lauria .
He writes for the Sunday Times of London , Boston Globe and Bloomberg News , the Huffington Post .
He is the co-author of the new book : " A Political Odyssey : The Rise of American Militarism and One Mans Fight to Stop It " with former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Mike Gravel .
Welcome to the show , Joe .
Lauria :
Thank you , Scott .
Horton :
It 's good to have you here .
You came to my attention early this year when this three part - I guess it turned into a four part series - in the London Times came out , about at least part of the case of Sibel Edmonds , the former FBI translator - turned - whistleblower , and she 's raised allegations kind of in all different directions - drug - smuggling and all kinds of different corruption and prior knowledge of impending attacks before 911 etc , and yet you guys focused really on the nuclear black market angle of her story .
So I guess , if we could start here , Joe , perhaps if you could share with the audience a bit of the background of who Sibel is and her case , why she is a credible witness , and then what you guys began to find when you started looking into verifying her story .
Lauria : Sure .
Sibel Edmonds is a Turkish and Farsi speaker who was hired by the FBI shortly after 911 - I think it was September 20 2001 - when there was suddenly a need to listen to a backlog of tapes that had been gathered by the FBI , and wiretaps , principally of the Turkish embassy in Washington - traffic in and out of there - that had gone on from 1995 till 2001 .
So Sibel went over six years of tapes , over a period of six months , and she started to make complaints about various things that were going on at the FBI , and she caused a lot of problems there because she was complaining particularly about one of her co-workers who she found worked for , and was also a member of , the American Turkish Council , which Sibel began to hear on these tapes was a crucial element in this nuclear procurement ring that she heard on the tapes .
Now , as you know , she was fired in March 2002 , she tried to sue to get her job back , this was all stopped and Ashcroft , the Attorney General , put a State Secrets Privilege gag order on her , after Sibel had gone to Senator Grassley and Representative Waxman - they listened to her several times , they took down her information , they promised hearings if Democrats took over the House , which they did in 2006 , and that seemed to be progressing until Ashcroft put this gag order on her and the congressmen removed the information from their website that Sibel had given them and they never spoke about this again , even though we know - and this is related to Gravel 's case too , we 'll talk about that later - no congressman can be gagged by congress under Article Six of the constitution , they can't be questioned about anything they say in a legislative Act on the House floor or Senate floor or anywhere where there is a legislative act .
So , the congressmen wimped out basically , Waxman and Grassley .
Sibel lost her case , and she was gagged .
She got the ACLU to be her attorney , and they claimed that she is the most gagged person in the history of the US .
So she pretty much held to that gag until December of last year when she put out on her website , and various other people that you know on the web , that she was willing to talk to the media , and tell them everything that she knew - because the press did not know what the real essence of what she had learned listening to these tapes , aside from some small complaints about irregularities at the FBI at Washington where she worked .
Nobody in the US media took her up on her offer which is interesting , and something I ’d like to get into later , but the Sunday Times , we contacted her , one of my colleagues , Chris Gourlay in London , in December , and Sibel actually called back and we began discussing with her the story , and then we ran - as you said - three stories about Sibel , and a fourth one on a related issue , and what Sibel revealed to us , and has been revealing little by little since January , is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the US to procure nuclear designs and parts for the AQ Khan network , and it was done not through Pakistani intelligence directly , but through the Turkish embassy .
Turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to Turkish military attaches , who then turned it over to the ISI , and from there went on to the nuclear black market .
To procure these parts and designs , high government US officials helped facilitate Turkish - Israeli PhD students to get into nuclear facilities in the US , they worked with the RAND corporation as well , some moles with RAND to help get this information .
There was at least one American company , Giza Technologies , that was helping with parts , probably there were others , and this thing went on from 1995 at least until 2002 , and it could still be going on - when this operation was shut down by the Dept of Defense and the State Dept .
Now , Sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments - Defense and State - were involved in this ring .
She has named them on her website - at least , she has not named them , she has photographs of people - other bloggers have named them .
We have not named them for legal reasons , we have not been able to confirm their involvement so I wo n't be able to speak about who they are , but we believe Sibel obviously , and our job has been to corroborate what she has told us , and we 've gotten lots of corroboration on the edges , but the main details , some of the main facts have been difficult to get .
The main reason is that people who are in the know could go to jail for speaking about it , as Sibel can , and she has risked going to jail .
And I know you 've had Daniel Ellsberg on your show and he has talked about Sibel , and Daniel has written the foreword to the book I did with Gravel as well , and there are n’t many Sibel Edmonds around , there are n’t many Daniel Ellsbergs around who will risk their careers and possible imprisonment to speak about these things .
So what Sibel has given us is quite a fascinating and disturbing picture of what is going on and what I did last month - in June , rather - was to find the people immediately above her in the FBI who had worked with her on this case .
I spoke with three of them , at length , and they have , just by virtue of them speaking to me , corroborated in general terms , that this story is true .
They cannot , and would not , go into the details unfortunately because that could land them in a lot of trouble , including imprisonment , because this has been completely classified .
Horton :
These were FBI agents you spoke to ?
Lauria : Yes
Horton :
And you said there were three different ones ?
Lauria : Yes .
One lived in Maryland , another lived in Virginia , but when I went out to see him I learned that he'd moved out West somewhere .
He , we know from Sibel , was very angry when they shut down this investigation .
You know , the FBI gets a bum rap , a lot of times , there 's a lot to be answered for in this case , but we have to understand that there are good agents - ' good ' in the sense of wanting to do their job , which is to investigate crimes - and the political appointees at the top , when they get the pressure from larger forces , the Whitehouse , or the Defense Dept or the State Dept , are stopped , and they are very angry , a lot of these guys that they could n't pursue this no matter where it led , and this is what we saw in the case with Sibel , we saw it in the case with the Tinners in Switzerland where suddenly the US put pressure on the prosecutor , and the prosecution has been dropped and evidence destroyed , and in the fourth story in our series about Peter Griffin , a very close associate of AQ Khan since the 70s who had an investigation going on , with evidence gathered by the British Customs Dept and that was squashed as well , and without explanation .
Horton :
We 've got plenty of time here so lets put off the Tinners and Peter Griffin and this stuff for a little while here and go back over a few things that you 've already mentioned .
First of all , I understand British libel law and all that kind of thing but you 're not going to have to hang up on me if I say the names of the people she 's talking about ?
Lauria :
No I wo n't , but I 'm not going to confirm what you 're saying though .
You can say whatever you want .
Horton :
There is a whole list of her " Rogues Gallery " and so forth there at justacitizen.com , but particularly when we 're talking about the State Dept , the accusations , and this is obviously the guy that your article centers around is Marc Grossman , and then she says Perle and Feith at the Defense Dept , right ?
Lauria :
Well I can't comment on the names
Horton : OK , well , anyone can Google that and look it right up .
OK , secondly , as far as her credibility goes , because there is a State Secrets Privilege gag , and she has only been able to say so much , you said you 've talked to these three FBI agents just a couple of months ago in June who confirmed some of this story for you .
Obviously you had other sources besides Sibel for the series in the Sunday Times , I wonder if you could elaborate on that , maybe the Inspector General 's report , statements of various senators , that kind of thing , so that people understand that when you 're talking about .
You know , we 're talking about American moles , and Turkish moles , and Pakistani moles , and America ’s nuclear program , this is some pretty out - there kind of stuff , so I want people to understand that what they 're hearing is not some comic book .
This is actually real !
Lauria :
Well , a lot of ... journalism is a credibility game , so we have to believe , first of all , our source , and we do believe Sibel .
The issue then becomes corroborating what she says , because we need facts .
You can't just go on whether we believe someone or not , and then the people we speak to we have to be able to believe them .
And as I pointed out , there are not that many people who are aware of what is going on .
There are the participants in the ring , who are never going to speak , of course , and there are the investigators in the FBI , and in the CIA - I did n’t bring that up , we could talk about the Valerie Plame connection that we uncovered in this story too - and then there are analysts like Philip Giraldi , the former CIA station chief in Istanbul , I believe , who knows Sibel , knows a lot about the case , who can provide on - the - record points of view that allow the reader to understand that this is not a comic - book episode , that this is very , very plausible , and totally within reason that this story that Sibel is telling us could happen - that high - level government officials could be involved in facilitating this .
And you go back to AQ Khan 's network in the 70s and the Reagan administration , you can even go back further to the Carter administration when they tried to go after the Pakistanis to try to stop them from developing a nuclear weapon .
Then when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan , they needed Pakistan to help arrange the payment and the training of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan , so they suddenly turned a blind eye to Pakistan ’s nuclear program .
And the Reagan administration almost actively helped them do this because the Chinese were giving information to Pakistan , and they wanted the Chinese nuclear business for Westinghouse , it 's obvious that the administrations starting from Carter and all the way has helped the AQ Khan network - at least by either protecting it , or even actively helping it , so this is just another phase of it .
This story is not off - the - wall , if you started from the 70s you could start a direct line - Sibel just came in and heard what was going on from 95 to at least 2002 and possibly still today .
So as I was saying , we have the three types of sources : there 's Sibel who has gone on the record at great risk to herself , although I do n’t think they want to move on her because that would create the US media attention that our stories have not been able to create .
There are those who are directly involved in the investigation - the FBI and CIA - and there are the analysts .
So we 've got analysts on the record saying things , but we need really FBI and CIA people to corroborate the details of what she is telling us , which we believe .
We believed enough to write it in our stories without a lot of direct corroboration , because we believed that we should put her claims out there , and those FBI agents that I spoke to at length , and I got into the home of one for an hour and a half , and I spoke several times in front of the homes of another one .
The FBI made a formal complaint with the Sunday Times to keep me away from his house - why would they do that ?
Why was Sibel gagged if what she was saying is true ?
But the fact that these FBI agents spoke in general terms to me about her , made claims that she 's not crazy , that she was not a fantasist , but that they could not go into details for the reasons I describe , may fall short perhaps of where we'd like to be , because we have a lot more stuff that she has given us , but we have not run the stories .
I 'm happy that a lot of the bloggers in the US and the foreign press has picked up on these stories , it has been total silence in the US , and there are people eager maybe to see more stories coming out in our series , and we 're eager to get them out there , but we need more corroboration on the slew of more details that Sibel has given us - names , dates , places - that we believe but we cannot confirm yet because we can't get sources within the FBI to go on the record - even off the record , we do n't need them to go on the record - we just need to know that they 're giving us what they know , and I believe they know this , and I believe they want to talk , they would like to , they are just afraid , and you can hardly blame .
You have to put sometimes - and this may sound corny - the good of the country and real national security , not the phony stuff that the Bush administration is talking about and all the false fears that cover - up operations just like this .
And they can not go on the record for the reasons we 've been saying , and so that 's where we are right now in terms of corroboration .
Horton : OK - now , this has come up - the Tinners you brought up in talking about the corroboration , the people kind of shared with you the history of America 's relationship with the Pakistani nuclear program , please provide me with some clarity - the AQ Khan network - well , as you said , they sort of at least turned a blind eye to it in the 1980s because they needed Pakistan ’s help with the war against the Russians in Afghanistan and that kind of thing , does that last all the way through ?
Was Sibel over - hearing people who were actually part of a secret mission to co-operate with the AQ Khan network ?
And she mistakenly thinks they were being criminals when actually perhaps it was just officially - sanctioned criminality ?
Lauria :
No , we 've never seen anything she told us as official US policy , but more of high - ranking US officials acting in an individual capacity in a rogue way .
We do n’t have any evidence , nor did she provide any evidence that this has been official US policy , but we do know that the Turkish and Israeli students getting this information , turning it over to Turkish businessmen , who then sold it - and everybody was getting paid along the way here - do n’t forget it 's about money - including some of the high ranking US officials - they turned it over to ISI .
One of the reasons that they used the Turks is because it would not look good for the Pakistan intelligence to be working inside the US .
You know , it 's interesting , another point of view with the Bush administration suddenly turning against the ISI for some reason in the last few weeks - but certainly they have worked closely with the CIA for Afghanistan , and also inside the US here in getting this information into the hands of the ISI , and AQ Khan worked obviously very closely together .
So why do n’t you drop these new designs , new parts , new information was sold - Iran , Libya , North Korea , perhaps , with the help of US Government officials .
Now if this were a sting operation , as we understand , I 've heard second hand that some correspondents in Washington have been told by their intelligence sources to stay away from this Sunday Times series because this is a big sting going on , and if you publish this you 'll ruin the thing - but I mean , as Dan Ellsberg pointed out to me , and I think he 's probably said to your show earlier , if that were the case , well they did a bad job , because Iran , North Korea , Libya - so - called enemies of the US got that bomb , or that information about the bomb , and they did n’t move early enough to do that .
So this is obviously not true - I do n’t believe that it was a sting .
I think that is not true , I think that these officials were facilitating this .
Horton :
There 's a sort of an assumption there that if the CIA was working with this AQ Khan network that it would have to have been in order to stop them , but - like you said - they 've been helping these guys since the 1970s .
What indicates that they would want to stop them ?
Lauria : Well , who in the CIA and the FBI ?
Not every rank and file FBI agent and CIA agent is told that we 're protecting these guys because we want them to have the weapons , we want to enrich ourselves , or for other strategic reasons , but only top officials who were implicated will put a stop on the investigations so we saw Valerie Plame working , investigating , just as the FBI agents I spoke to were investigating this same nuclear ring that Sibel has laid out for all of us , and when Valerie Plame got too close at the American Turkish Council - again , the nexus of this operation in the US , and where she met her husband Joe Wilson - she was there and this high - ranking US government official ...
In an anonymous letter that we got through a think tank in Washington said that this high - ranking government official - and it names him - he alerted a Turkish front company called White Energy that was part of the nuclear procurement network inside the US to stay away from Brewster Jennings , which was the CIA front company - that this Turkish front company wanted to hire ...
Horton : Ah - and this is long before Robert Novak said anything about it on TV
Lauria : Yeah , yeah .
Look , there are two parts to the Valerie Plame thing , we believe .
The first part is this is in August 2001 that this high - ranking US official told the Turkish company to stay away from Brewster Jennings because they were actually investigating this ring .
That blew the cover of Brewster Jennings and it happened to be that Valerie Plame was an important agent within Brewster Jennings that was in the ATC - so in effect , it blew Valerie Plame 's cover amongst the people that she was investigating , not publicly .
What happened with Novak is that it became public knowledge when he wrote it in his column - that very much may have been motivated it seems by Cheney 's office to punish her husband because he tried to reveal that the evidence for the war in Iraq was phony - but that was a separate angle .
The mainstream press was very very happy about the Novak story , they think they 've got it , and they 're not interested in going back to when Valerie 's identity was first revealed , more seriously , than by Robert Novak .
Horton : Right - that 's something that 's not of interest to anyone , I do n't think .
You guys reported about it in the London Times , but that 's the only place I ’ve ever heard that .
Lauria : Yeah , well , you know the FBI was asked in a Freedom of Information request to reveal the files of Sibel 's case , they claimed that the files do n't exist , I saw an FBI document that shows that the files do exist - it could be that they were destroyed , so they could be telling the truth there - so obviously there appears to be a lot of cover - up going on , and they shut down the investigation .
So you were saying why the CIA , on one hand seemed to be working with this network , and on the other hand they seem to be shutting it down - so I do n't think Valerie Plame was in on wanting this network to succeed , I think that she was trying to do her job , just like the FBI agents I spoke to were trying to do their job , just like the customs officials were trying to do their job , but when they get too close to uncovering official involvement , it has got to be stopped .
And there 's no explanation .
This is what happens , there 's no explanation - and the press does n't probe it that deeply , unfortunately .
And in the US in particular .
I mean , it 's just horrendous - and I 'll tell you , and I have n’t revealed this , it 's not a big deal , but I went to the Boston Globe because I ’ve worked seven years for them as a correspondent , mostly at the UN , and I laid out the story for them , I wanted some American media attention and I talked to a correspondent that I ’ve worked with for years at the Washington bureau and I could not convince her in an hour to even look into this story , let alone to buy any of what I was telling her .
Horton : Really ?
Lauria : Yeah .
they did n’t think there was anything to it and that Sibel obviously was not credible without even checking it out - and I think that these - having worked for mainstream media since 1990 , always as a freelancer - except for a year at Bloomberg and I fled from that place - that these are centrists .
Centrism is the philosophy of the American media - and that essentially backs the status quo , when you 're a centrist , and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that you 're allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then you 're transmitting these assumptions , and reinforcing every day that the US is really a functioning democracy , not even a representative democracy .
And as we know of course there are oligarchic interests that buy off Congress , that puts the person in the Whitehouse that they need - and this gets me into the book of Gravel - that gets the defense contracts necessary to pump the American people with fear , so that we allow our taxpayers money to go and pay for defense outlays that are absolutely unnecessary and then fight wars that enhance our power and wealth ...
Horton : Yep -
I 'm really interested in that scene , though , the bureau chief who just , in an hour , you can't even get her interested
Lauria :
It was not the bureau chief , it was a reporter there
Horton : OK - but still , I just like that ; ' No No No , just talk to the hand , I 'm sorry , I do n't want to hear it , ' fingers in the ears
Lauria : I do n't think that they were capable - not ' capable ' - the mindset of the American mainstream press does not allow certain ideas to easily filter through : the idea that high - ranking US officials might actually be facilitating this ...
It 's entertainment all the time , the presidential campaign is entertainment , and do you actually think that these guys would actually go in there and make changes , whoever wins , when behind this wall of entertainment put forward by news media and the entertainment industry is a murky world of terrorism , nuclear procurement ring , of CIA , of the FBI working - and this rarely breaks through to the mainstream press , and the idea that the American officials ...
Look : it 's the rotten apple theory , as opposed to the rotten orchard , the mainstream press will always want something that will bring down a government official or a corporate executive who had his hand in the till , or did some kind of corruption , and that says 'look , we 're doing our job , we 're defending the American people by doing our job as journalists .
We really are questioning government authority . '
Well that 's baloney .
I mean , once in a while you get a guy who falls through , but they rarely look at the entire system being rotten , not just one official here or there being rotten , and they pat themselves on the back .
And when I say the entire system being rotten , I mean Congress that is enthralled to corporate backers , and approving their aggressive foreign policy that enriches themselves , and does nothing to secure the American people or the interests of most American people .
That is not even in the discussion in the mainstream press , so this Boston Globe reporter was unable to conceive easily that a government official could have been involved .
They do have higher standards , maybe , than the British press - I 've worked for both the British and American press - and I find the British papers maybe are too quick to go to story without corroboration , and the American papers need 4 or 5 sources for something that the reporter even witnessed directly sometimes .
So , I did n’t ask the Globe to run the story straight away , I just wanted to start an investigation and I wanted to be part of it obviously , and if we did n’t find anything that met the Globe 's standard , that would be fine , but they would n’t even begin to look into it .
Now why did n’t any other papers look into the story ?
I mean , Chicago Public Radio has done a series on it , they interviewed me on that , they interviewed Sibel , there was an attempt there , but it just does n’t fit into the mindset of the American reporter .
They 're ' doing their job ' and it's also on careerism I think , feeling the power vicariously of being close to government officials , rather than challenging them , wanting to be close to them , and part of the official theme .
And of course we saw the cheerleading for all the military adventures and essentially the contracts that come back to the defense contractors .
It 's self censorship , and if you are going to get a memo from your editor about how to cover the thing then you 're not going to be working there too long .
You just know what you 've got to do .
I 've worked for them , so I know what I can write and what I can't write , and this story is just outside the imagination of the American press , and I do n't know how we 're going to get it in there .
I really appreciate you having me on , and Dan Ellsberg and Sibel several times and Luke Ryland recently to talk about this case , because it needs to be spoken about and we need more papers to look into this story , more pressure put on by the press .
When the FBI can not do its job any more because it is stopped - and this is one of the arguments I gave to these agents - this is the role of journalism , to step in there and do our own investigation .
Unfortunately we do n’t have subpoena power , so we 're very limited in what we can do to get people to talk to us , but at least we 've got the story out there .
Horton :
Well , two questions , first of all , do you think that the internet is changing that at all ?
Do you think that that is more pressure on the mainstream media to kind of think a little bit more broadly ?
And secondly , are there any other major outlets in America that are mainstream enough that it 's worth doing the work to publish it for them but who might be willing to let you write this story ?
Lauria :
Well , frankly , right now , on the second question , since we 're still working on it for the Sunday Times I 'm going to stick with them , I do n't want to write it for anybody else .
I'm a blogger at the Huffington Post , and I could write about it there but I want to investigate it for the Sunday Times and I hope that we can break it , and then other papers will pick it up - that has n't happened yet , but we 're going to stick with the story right there .
Your first question about the internet and its role , there 's only one thing that will move the mainstream media , and that 's business , whether it starts to hurt their business , and it is , it has , they 're terrified of the bloggers , and they 're terrified of the internet , because they realize that it is taking business away from them , people are reading them .
At a basic level , classified ads are going online , that 's really hurt the press , but in terms of journalism they 're very much aware of that , and they 're playing around with having their own reporters do blogs to try to co-opt the thing and it's not working very well , and there 's a lot of crap on the internet - I would think that a large percent of what bloggers write is absolutely nonsense , and opinion without any fact , they 're not trained as journalists , but the fact is that 's very much the way it was at the beginning of the country , with the pamphleteers too , and a lot of it is anonymous , but there are a lot of important bloggers who are doing better work than mainstream journalists , they 're doing it without pay !
They 're doing it because they want to show anywhere where the press is not doing its job , and they are feeling that pressure , and I hope that eventually as the newspaper business continues to die , they hire - millions of dollars they pay consultants to find ways of advertising the paper , television to get young people to read the paper - all this crap when they rather should pay journalists to go out and get stories .
That 's what sells newspapers .
That 's what always did .
They seem to have forgotten this .
They want just puzzles and horoscopes and comics , and whatever they can do to lure people to buy the paper .
And the blogosphere is showing that there are people like Luke and others who are really starting to lead the way .
And they are n’t professionals in the same sense of the training , but they are filling in where the mainstream press is failing - we 've seen government run amok because of that , as you know - eight years of the Bush administration .
Horton :
One thing that we have going for us on the internet too is the hyperlink - if we choose , every assertion that we make can be a link to the footnote , and the proof of it , and then in a situation like that , anyone who writes something that does not link to the proof of their assertions is automatically suspect .
In the marketplace of ideas , well , if this is so true , where 's all your links ?
Lauria :
That 's a very good point .
Of course , in a printed newspaper you 're supposed to name you source if you can , on the record , and if not , you at least allude to someone whose identity is being withheld but on the internet , yes , the links can go on and on .
You can keep investigating the story as much as you want , and they keep leading to different links .
Horton : I 'm sorry - let 's get back to this whole Nuclear Black Market thing .
Tell me about this Tinner case - I guess , for the audience , give the background , German guys , arrested in Switzerland , computers destroyed , worked for the CIA , something like that .
What is this story , what does it mean ?
Lauria :
We have not done a story on the Tinners yet .
I just briefly mentioned them I think in the Griffin story .
The Tinners met AQ Khan , I believe , when he was working in Europe in the 70s when he started to steal the designs there , so they 've been very close associates with AQ Khan , and as AQ Khan was thrown into house arrest a couple of years ago , and he 's recently started to speak out again , and what he 's saying again is what Sibel has been saying in a way - which is that he got all this help from European companies , and from the US , and that they all knew what he was doing .
So the Tinners were , after AQ Khan was put under house arrest , they started to prosecute people who were related to his procurement network going back to Griffin in Britain , and the Tinners in Switzerland , and this was suddenly shut down , and the US prosecutor had the files destroyed at the behest of the US .
I interviewed David Albright about this some months ago - and I 'm trying to remember , and he believed that China was the source of AQ Khan , not the US at the time , but that the Tinners were helping with parts and this was shut down , they just destroyed the evidence .
We do n't know why , it 's obvious why - it 's obvious why , I think , to us , because the Tinners were involved with the CIA , according to the Albright , and others - and exactly why , how that happened - in other words , were they being used as double agents ?
Were they being used to help facilitate this ?
This is not clear to me .
I can't give an answer to that , not having investigated the Tinners case or written anything about that , but I ’m just telling you what I ’ve read .
But they did work for the CIA , according to David Albright , he told me that .
He is an expert on nuclear weapons .
Horton :
And it should be noted here that the AQ Khan network , for all their nuclear proliferation , the terrible results that we know of , as far as I can tell , is that the North Koreans got some equipment that they never used , the Libyans got some equipment they never used , the Iranians got some equipment that they are using to enrich uranium to a measly 3.6 % in the presence of IAEA inspectors , so for all the crisis , we do n't have any rogue state making nuclear weapons because of this , other than Pakistan .
Right ?
Lauria :
That 's true .
Well , the North Koreans did explode a device , did n’t they , a couple of years ago ?
Horton :
Oh yeah , but that was made out of plutonium harvested from their Soviet era reactors .
There ’s never been any evidence that they enriched uranium at all .
They just bought the equipment .
Lauria :
Well , I 'll tell you about enrichment - Khan and his network enriched monetarily !
That 's a big part of this , you know , the business side of it .
That reminds me , one of the theories is that they were actually selling phony parts to these countries .
Horton :
Well , let 's hope that you can keep being a careerist journalist by writing good stories and proving that you actually are doing what it really takes , and not just cozying up there with your hairdo like the rest of these goofballs .
Lauria : I 'm trying , and it's tough , I tell you , in terms of making a living trying to do it , but I appreciate what you said .
Horton : And I appreciate your effort .
Everybody , that 's Joe Lauria from the Sunday Times , formerly from the Boston Globe , Bloomberg News .
You can find him at the Huffington Post .
he is the co-author of Senator Mike Gravel 's new book , A Political Odyssey : The Rise of American Militarism and One Man ’s Fight to Stop It , and I urge you to check out the series co-written with Chris Gourlay and Jonathan Calvert at the London Times , that 's " For sale : West 's deadly nuclear secrets , " " FBI denies file exposing nuclear secrets theft , " " Tip - off thwarted nuclear spy ring probe " and " Inquiry into Nuclear Mr. Fix - it ? dropped . "
Thank you very much for your time today , Joe .
