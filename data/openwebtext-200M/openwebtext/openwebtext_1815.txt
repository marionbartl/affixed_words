Iran 's president has already called for Israel to be wiped off the map
" If European countries claim that they have killed Jews in World War II ... why do n't they provide the Zionist regime with a piece of Europe , " Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told Iranian television .
" Germany and Austria can provide the ... regime with two or three provinces for this regime to establish itself , and the issue will be resolved . "
The president 's remarks were quickly condemned by Israel and the US .
" This is not the first time , unfortunately , that the Iranian president has expressed the most outrageous ideas concerning Jews and Israel , " Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev said .
" He is not just Israel 's problem .
He is a worry for the entire international community , " he added .
' Outrageous '
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel , quoted by AFP agency , described the remarks as " an outrageous gaffe , which I want to repudiate in the sharpest manner " .
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the Iranian leader 's comments " further underscore our concerns about the regime " .
" And it 's all the more reason why it 's so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " he said .
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said : " I condemn [ the comments ] unreservedly .
They have no place in civilised political debate . "
Mr Ahmadinejad 's stance was also condemned by French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who were meeting in Berlin .
Nuclear row
In October , Mr Ahmadinejad caused an outcry by calling for Israel to " be wiped off the map " .
His latest comments come as Iran is mired in controversy over its nuclear programme , which it says is solely for the provision of fuel , but which the US says is aimed at producing nuclear weapons .
An International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report in September said questions about Iran 's nuclear programme remained unanswered despite an intensive investigation .
DIGG THIS
Amidst all the discussion and debate about whether President Bush has violated the law by ordering the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to record telephone conversations , we must not overlook an important fact : the United States is now traveling in uncharted waters , ones in which the ruler of the nation is exercising omnipotent power over the American people .
A more appropriate word would be one that offends some Americans when it is applied to their system of government : dictatorship .
But as uncomfortable as that term might make Americans , the fact is that ever since 9/11 Americans have been living under dictatorial rule .
What is a dictator ?
A dictator is a ruler whose powers are omnipotent , that is , unconstrained by external or superior law .
A dictator has the power to take whatever actions he wants without concerning himself about whether they are legal .
Anything the dictator does is legal because he is the law .
It was n’t always that way in the United States .
When the Constitution was enacted , its goal was not only to call the federal government into existence but also to ensure that it would not be headed by a dictator .
To accomplish that , the Framers inserted language expressly limiting the president to a few well - defined powers .
If a power was n’t enumerated , the president could not legally exercise it .
The Constitution was the higher law that governed the actions of all federal officials .
What if the president intentionally violated those restrictions ?
The Constitution provided two remedies .
First , the judicial branch could declare the president ’s acts to be in violation of the Constitution and order him to comply with its judgment .
As the Supreme Court held in the famous case of Marbury v. Madison , the judicial branch ’s determination of constitutionality trumped the president ’s opinion of constitutionality .
Second , the Constitution gave the legislative branch of government — the Congress — the power to impeach the president and remove him from office .
What many Americans fail to understand is that it is entirely possible to have democracy and dictatorship at the same time .
Democracy entails the use of elections to place people into positions of power .
Dictatorship entails the extent of the powers that the ruler is able to exercise after he assumes office .
Therefore , it is entirely possible to have a democratically elected dictator — a person who has been duly elected to office who exercises dictatorial powers .
This is exactly the case of George W. Bush .
Some Americans become offended whenever critics bring up the name of Adolf Hitler in discussing the dictatorial powers that President Bush is now exercising .
They miss the point .
When critics bring up Hitler ’s name in the context of Bush ’s exercise of dictatorial powers , they ’re not suggesting that Bush and Hitler are somehow equivalent evils or that Bush has committed the horrors that Hitler committed .
What they ’re instead saying is that Hitler sets a good benchmark for what dictatorship involves .
Therefore , he provides a good means by which to measure the powers being exercised by another ruler .
If George W. Bush or any other American president exercises the same types of omnipotent powers that Hitler exercised , that should serve as a powerful wake - up call for the American people , who have long wondered how the German people could have allowed Hitler to become a dictator ( see my article  How Hitler Became a Dictator ) .
Therefore , the issue is not whether Bush is a good man , as many of his supporters contend .
The issue is whether this good man has assumed dictatorial powers in the wake of 9/11 .
The issue also is whether any man , good or evil , should ever be given dictatorial powers .
In fact , Vice President Cheney was making much the same point when he recently said that Venezuela ’s democratically elected president , Hugo Chavez , was comparable to Hitler .
Cheney was n’t suggesting that Chavez had instituted concentration camps in which millions were being killed .
What he was saying was that Chavez , albeit democratically elected , was consolidating power . 
The question that the American people must ask is : Has President Bush been doing the same thing — consolidating power — ever since 9/11 , especially as part of his war on terrorism  and his invasion of Iraq ?
Everyone would have to concede that he has .
Dictatorial powers
Consider the specific powers the president is claiming :
1 . The power to order the Pentagon to take any American anywhere in the world , including here in the United States , into custody and punish him , even execute him , without according him the protections of the Bill of Rights .
Under this power , all the Pentagon has to do is place a document in front of the president labeling any particular American a terrorist ,  and once the president signs it the Pentagon has the omnipotent power to punish the terrorist . 
Does the person who is labeled a terrorist have the right to appeal such a determination ?
No .
Even if the designated terrorist is a newspaper editor , a prominent celebrity , or a well - known anti-war critic , the president ’s determination is final .
Keep in mind that , according to the president and the Pentagon , we are at war and neither the courts nor the Congress should be permitted to interfere with the military decisions made by the Pentagon and the commander in chief .
Are there any restraints on the particular type of punishment that the military metes out to a designated terrorist ?
No .
Since the president and the Pentagon consider a terrorist to be an illegal enemy combatant , they refuse to be bound by the Geneva Convention , which provides long - established protections for prisoners of war .
No one needs to be reminded of how U.S. military personnel have subjected the terrorists  held in U.S. facilities at Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib , and elsewhere to torture , sex abuse , rape , and murder .
While Americans have not been subjected to the same mistreatment , that is simply owing to a discretionary decision by the president and the Pentagon ; it could be changed at any time .
2 . The power to record telephone conversations of the American people without first securing a search warrant from a magistrate in the judicial branch , as the Bill of Rights requires .
In fact , under the president ’s rationale , there ’s nothing to prevent him from conducting any warrantless searches as long as they are part of the war on terrorism . 
3 . The power to send the entire nation into war against a foreign nation without a declaration of war from Congress , despite the fact that the Constitution expressly delegates that power to Congress , not the president .
No one can deny that those three powers are dictatorial in nature .
But it ’s important that they be considered in the context of the president ’s own justifications for exercising such powers .
It is those justifications that have sent America sailing into the uncharted waters of dictatorial rule .
The congressional justification
The president cites two primary justifications for exercising omnipotent power , which he interweaves .
First , he says that Congress authorized him to take whatever measures he deemed necessary to seek out and arrest or destroy the terrorists who were responsible for the 9/11 attacks .
Second , he says that since we are now at war — the war on terrorism — he is able to exercise omnipotent powers as the nation ’s military commander in chief .
Bush ’s first justification involves the congressional resolution that was enacted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , which authorized him to use force against those who had conspired to carry out the attacks .
Ironically , Bush ’s justification is quite similar to the one that Hitler used to justify his dictatorial powers .
After the terrorist attack on the German parliament building , Hitler went to his legislature and argued for a temporary suspension of civil liberties .
After heated discussion and debate , including Hitler ’s suggestion that such legislation was necessary to protect the freedom of the German people , the necessary number of votes for passage was finally secured .
The law granting dictatorial powers to Hitler became known as the  Enabling Act . 
How is this different , in principle , from Bush ’s claim that the authorization - of - force resolution that Congress enacted immediately after 9/11 gave him omnipotent powers to deal with the terrorists ?
There are two major problems with Bush ’s reasoning .
One is that , unlike Germany ’s Enabling Act , which expressly suspended civil liberties , the resolution enacted by Congress did not do any such thing .
Yet Bush is effectively interpreting it to mean that Congress granted him what the German Enabling Act granted Hitler — the power to override constitutional protections of civil liberties .
More important , however , is the fact that , under the U.S. Constitution , Congress is not empowered to pass laws that nullify the protections and guarantees in the Constitution .
The only way that any provision in the document can be nullified is through constitutional amendment .
A statutory attempt to nullify jury trials , search warrant requirements , due process of law , and right to counsel has no legal effect whatsoever .
The commander in chief justification
Bush ’s other justification for the assumption and exercise of omnipotent powers is his role as commander in chief of the armed forces during a time of war .
What war ?
The war on terrorism ,  which , again ironically , was the same type of war that Hitler declared after terrorists struck the Reichstag with a firebomb .
There is one crucial difference between Hitler ’s claim of power and Bush ’s claim of power , however .
The Enabling Act was only a temporary grant of powers .
Each time it was set to expire , Hitler would duly return to the Reichstag and secure legislation temporarily  extending it .
Bush ’s rationale for his omnipotent powers , on the other hand , is that , as the nation ’s military commander in chief in the war on terrorism ,  his omnipotent powers will last as long as the war continues .
Of course , since it is impossible to know with any degree of certainty when the last terrorist is exterminated or neutralized , that means that for all practical purposes the war on terrorism is perpetual , which means that Bush ’s powers are perpetual as well ( and will as well be held by his democratically elected successor in 2009 ) .
There is no merit whatsoever , however , to Bush ’s argument that the Constitution grants omnipotent powers to a president when he puts on the helmet of a military commander in chief .
In fact , there is no suggestion whatsoever in the Constitution that war gives rise to the exercise of any powers that nullify any of the other restrictions on power in the Constitution , especially in the Bill of Rights .
What Bush is relying on is the old European notion of imperial dictatorial powers that were claimed by a ruler when he led his military forces into war against another nation .
Think about Napoleon , who became a dictator by centralizing power , especially in his role as commander in chief of French military forces .
Or , closer to home , think of the president of Mexico , Santa Anna , whose centralization of power not only made him the  Napoleon of the West  but also precipitated the insurgency in Texas .
This is how Bush views himself as the nation ’s commander in chief — as a Napoleon or a Santa Anna , along with the omnipotent powers that those two dictators exercised .
It ’s the old European notion of inherent imperial powers granted the sovereign , both as emperor and as commander in chief of the nation ’s military forces .
There ’s just one big problem with Bush ’s analysis , however .
Our American ancestors fully and completely rejected the notion of inherent imperial powers with the enactment of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
That , in fact , was one major reason for limiting the powers of the president by expressly enumerating them in the Constitution — to negate the old European notion of inherent sovereign powers .
Dictatorship or liberty ?
Of course , there are those who say ,  The situation is not really that serious .
President Bush is a good man .
He can be trusted to do the right thing .
He wo n’t abuse these powers .
He ’s exercised them against only a few Americans . 
They ’re missing some important points .
One is that no matter how good a man President Bush is , dictatorships are the opposite of liberty and , therefore , are morally wrong , no matter how good or benevolent the dictator is .
Moreover , once dictatorial powers are relinquished to a good man ,  there is no assurance that he wo n’t become a bad man or that a bad man will not succeed him .
A good test is : Would I want the most despicable character I can think of — say , Adolf Hitler , Joseph Stalin , or Mao Zedong — to have any of these powers over me and my country ?
If your answer is  No ,  then your answer should be the same with respect to George W. Bush .
As history has shown , once a ruler is given dictatorial powers , there is no assurance that the powers will not be expanded to larger groups of people and abused much more extensively , especially if there is a huge crisis that strikes fear and panic among the citizenry .
After all , keep in mind that , in the absence of the terrorist strike on the Reichstag , Hitler might well not have been able to secure passage of the Enabling Act .
Ask yourself :
How would the compliant , Republican - controlled Congress respond to a request by President Bush for an expansion of powers if terrorists exploded a massive bomb today in the middle of the U.S. Capitol ?
Unfortunately , many Americans , like other people in history , do n’t want to face the disquieting truth about the dark and ominous direction in which their nation is currently headed .
They simply wish to bury their heads in the sand and not analyze too closely the logical implications of the president ’s and the Pentagon ’s position .
They do n’t want to face that we are now traveling in uncharted waters with respect to dictatorship .
Here is the unvarnished truth that Americans are trying to avoid confronting : Both the president and the Pentagon have repeatedly emphasized that the nation is at war .
It is a war against the terrorists .
In this war , the entire world is the battlefield , including both Iraq and the United States .
In this war , the president is the nation ’s commander in chief and , as such , wields omnipotent powers to defeat the enemy and win the war .
These powers include the power to arrest and punish Americans as illegal enemy combatants  — denying them jury trials , due process , lawyers , or any federal court interference .
They have the power to take people into custody and transport them to foreign regimes for torture .
They have the power to record telephone conversations without warrants .
In other words , the president and the Pentagon have the same powers to wage their war on terrorism in the United States as they have in Iraq .
Yes , you read that right — Iraq .
That is the logical consequence of what these people are saying .
They have the power to do everything they ’re doing in Iraq right here in the United States : the power to break people ’s doors down and search their homes and businesses without warrants ; the power to arrest and indefinitely detain people ; the power to torture and abuse prisoners and detainees ; the power to fire missiles into cars or apartment complexes where the terrorists  are traveling or hiding out ; the power to confiscate guns .

The case for higher speed limits on Hwy .
401

The Case For Higher Speed Limits on Hwy .
401 ( Trans - Canada Hwy )
Local News - Gord Thompson may be the only man in Ontario ever charged under the Highway Traffic
Act for obeying the letter of the law .
The teacher from Campbellford and another motorist caused a four - kilometre traffic jam on Highway 401 seven years ago by driving side by side at the posted 100 km/h speed limit .
They were charged with obstructing traffic and had their licences temporarily suspended .
Weeks earlier , Thompson had been ticketed for going 117 km/h on the same road and staged his slow - motion protest after a judge told him he was breaking the law by going even a kilometre over the posted limit .
 It still kind of gets my blood going ,  Thompson said this week .
 The number on the [ speed limit ] sign is nt the number you re expected to drive at and no one will tell you what the tolerance actually is .
Thompsons situation may be the most ludicrous application of Ontarios speeding laws but it puts into focus what motorists prove with their right feet  that 100 km/h is often too slow for the provinces 400 - series highways .
A recent study by University of Toronto researcher Baher Abdulhai found every single driver exceeding the speed limit on some stretches of highway that he and graduate student Jaime Abraham studied .
His study recommended that the speed limit be raised to a more realistic 130 km/h .
That finding mirrors dozens of similar studies done on expressways in North America and Europe .
Studies indicate that 85 per cent of motorists drive at speeds between 110 km/h and 130 km/h on the 401 .
According to most traffic experts , such a widespread variance from the posted speed means the limit should be raised .
And a survey of almost 300 motorists in Belleville several years ago found the majority of drivers wanted the speed limit increased by at least 10 km/h .
The provincial government , however , has dismissed the latest study , saying it has no intention of raising speed limits .
 Our own research suggests that raising the speed limits would in fact lead to an increase in traffic injuries and fatalities ,  said Transportation Ministry spokesman Anser Ahmed .
The response to his study has disappointed Abdulhai .
 I have not seen any counter - arguments based on fact ,  he said this week .
 It s all been ,  You re going to kill people ,  [ or ]
 There would be blood all over the roads .
He was particularly upset by some media reports on his findings .
 What surprised me was the reaction from the public [ in TV reports ] ,  he said .
In one report , they showed a 50 - 50 split among people about the higher limit , but in some locations measured in the report , 100 per cent of people were driving over the limit .
 If 100 per cent of the people are violating [ the law ] when they drive , wheres the 50 per cent that opposes higher limits ?
The 100 km/h limit was set in the 1970s as a conservation measure during the oil crisis .
Before that , the limit was 115 km/h , even though cars had few of the safety features that todays drivers enjoy .
Scrapped limit
The United States scrapped its gas - saving 55 mph limit several years ago and left it to the states to set speed limits .
Most opted for a 65 or even 75 mph ( 105 to 120 km / h ) limit on major highways .
Since then , people on both sides of the issue have been producing studies .
Critics of higher speed limits point to an increased number of deaths on some highways with higher limits .
Supporters say raising speed limits actually makes highways safer .
They argue higher speeds encourage motorists to use the road more .
With increased traffic , the number of fatalities per 100 million miles driven  one of the basic measures of road safety  actually falls .
 It s one of those cases where you use statistics any way you want to ,  said David Leonhardt of the Canadian Automobile Association , which supported Abdulhais conclusions if combined with a program of increased speed limit enforcement .
Michael Cain , director of research for the B.C. group Safety by Education Not Speed Enforcement ( SENSE ) , said the groups efforts to raise speed limits drew the same fears of carnage on the roads .
 They said  The faster you go , the harder you hit ,  but that totally ignores the human interaction of driving ,  he said .
 The whole argument ignores the fact that if you dont have an accident , you dont get hurt . 
Abdulhai himself says higher speeds are not dangerous and that speed differentials cause accidents .
A higher speed limit , he argues , will not cause people to drive faster ; it merely reflects what they are already doing .
 It s really basic stuff ,  Abdulhai said .
 It s not rocket science . 
 Reasonable 
Jim Baxter , president of the National Motorists Association , a U.S. consumers group that supports higher speed limits , said he was familiar with Abdulhais study .
 What your professor is saying is set the speed limit at the speed at which traffic is moving , which I think is a reasonable and prudent thing to do ,  he said .
 People dont have a death wish .
You re not out to hurt yourself or to drive faster than is safe for the road . 
Most of the resistance to higher limits comes from police and the insurance companies , which both profit from speeding tickets , he said .
 Police like the low limit because it gives them a reason to stop anyone they want ,  he said .
 The insurance industry has always supported lower limits . 
The other knock at the higher limits is that cars use more fuel at higher speeds .
Baxter shrugs off that point .
 Modern vehicles dont have nearly the differential in fuel consumption that they used to ,  he said .
 It s an argument that might have held sway in  75 [ But ] the individual should be allowed to decide if the saving of time is worth it . 
Baxter said he is familiar with environmental arguments but that highway policy shouldnt be based on ideology .
 There are side elements out there who dont like people having the right to go anywhere they want however fast they want to go ,  he said .
 There are environmentalists who would like to see us walk everywhere . 
Leonhardt of the CAA said a higher limit on the 401 would allow police to concentrate on the very fast and the very slow drivers , who present the most danger in traffic .
Those who drive over the limit should receive zero tolerance ,  he said .
 And for people who want to drive 80 , maybe a 400 - series highway is not where they ought to be .
Baxter noted that realistic speed limits would be welcomed by motorists in Kingston , for it would dramatically cut down on travel times to Toronto or Ottawa .
Higher speeds are not only safer , but economically beneficial , argued SENSEs Cain .
 What we need to look at in this issue is where will society benefit ?  he said .
 [ Higher speed limits ] can reduce the number of crashes and provide benefits to the economy .
Leeds - Grenville MPP
Bob Runciman , who has had a 600 - km round - trip commute for 21 years , has publicly supported a higher speed limit on the 401 , as did former transportation minister Al Palladini , but the issue has never caught fire at Queens Park .
The last push to raise the limit dissolved after a rash of accidents involving wheels flying off heavy trucks .
As for Thompson , he has not had a speeding ticket since he and his companion set out on their legal Sunday drive , but hed love to go back in front of a judge .
 You know , when we did the protest at 100 , we did not overtake one single vehicle ,  he recalled .
 If I get a ticket for going 120 on the 401 now , Id go before the judge and say  I cant go at 100 , another judge told me I cant drive 100 on the 401.
Leonhardt said that incongruity needs to be addressed .
 That s the predicament that people are in right now , and people shouldnt be in that predicament . 

 The insurance industry has always supported lower limits . 
The insurance industry likes lower limits because it means more tickets for a wider variety of people rather than the truly dangerous drivers .
More tickets gives the insurance companies more opportunities to jack up rates on people who get charged for doing 60 in a 55 zone .
The other knock at the higher limits is that cars use more fuel at higher speeds .
Baxter shrugs off that point .
 Modern vehicles dont have nearly the differential in fuel consumption that they used to ,  Right on target .
I remember some of these environmentalist types insisting that cars get 30 % worse gas mileage at 70 than they do at 55 .
My car at the time was rated at 27 mpg highway at 55 mph .
I consistently got 30 mpg when going 70 - 75 on vacations .
By their logic my car would get 39 mpg at 55 mph , so my car must have been an anti-lemon , getting 12 mpg more than the typical model .
Of course the reality is that there 's very little difference in mileage at 55 mph vs. 70 mph .
In fact , in a car with a big engine , 70 mph is likely more efficient .
As for the safety argument , it 's laughable .
Speed differential kills more than speed does .
Making the much safer freeways less driveable with politically set speed limits and putting more traffic on the other roads leads to * more * head on collisions and more deaths ( furthermore , most freeway deaths are single - car collisions , much moreso than on " regular " roads ) .
That does n't mean that speed limits should be 90 mph .
It does mean that most drivers proceed at a safe and reasonable speed given the conditions and speed limits should be set based on what people actually are driving .
62 mph ( 100 kph ) on the 401 is ridiculously low .
It should be 115 ( 71 mph ) .

Having traveled this highway many times , I have to laugh at the inconsistency of the different cout actions .

Leonhardt of the CAA said a higher limit on the 401 would allow police to concentrate on the very fast and the very slow drivers , who present the most danger in traffic .
Those who drive over the limit should receive zero tolerance ,  I drive I5 ( in California ) daily , and its 2 - lane segments are almost a duplicate of the 401 ( the more generous shoulders and escape areas of I5 are the notable differences ) .
The mix of truck and auto traffic is similar too .
Having done it for three years now , there is no question in my mind that the slower traffic is more responsible for accidents than the occasional nut doing 95 ( mph ) .
The speed nut usually ends up doing himself in .
The slower nut usually takes several to a dozen or more vehicles into his excitement ...

typically drive at 70 - 75 Mph now .
Just for the record , NJ increased speed limits from 55 to 65 on certain roadways , as an experiment .
( Most motorists were already driving 62 - 64 mph . )
The experiment worked fine , but I 've noticed a side effect : motoristsdrive at 70 - 75 Mph now .
In some of the western states , where 70 - 75 mph limits are posted , typical speeds are well in excess of the limit .
On the basis of very limited observation , I 've tentatively concluded people tend to exceed the speed limit - no matter how high you set it .
To : serinde
Once the U.S switches over to metric speed limits , the politicians and the enviro wackos will be tempted to set them at 90 km/h regardless of the highway and particular traffic conditions .
Besides the revenue involved there 's the aim of getting every one out of their cars .
Something about the government knowing best how to take care of global warming for you and urging you to live smarter as though you did n't know how .
To : genefromjersey
Your limited observation does n't qualify as traffic engineering data , though .
The freeways in the US typically have a design speed of 75 miles per hour .
Going much faster than that in a typical auto yeilds a significantly more precarious driving sensation .
The reason people are going 70 - 75 on the freeway now that you have a 65 mph limit , is that the artificial 55 mph limit and its excessive fines exerted downward pressure on the overall speed of traffic that has been somewhat relieved by the 65 mph speed limit .
People are driving closer to the safe design speed of the roadway because they 're no longer threatened with half a dozen points on their license and three years of exhorbitant insurance rates for doing so .
If the speed limit were set to 70 - 75 , or even repealed entirely , a variety of traffic engineering studies indicate that the overall speed of traffic would settle in at the safe speed for the road , rather than increasing in 10 mph increments over the posted limit .

I understand there are some unposted roads - I think the Autobahn is one - and I 've heard there are still some drivers who can't rest unless they 've passed everyone ; with others behind them trying to pass them !

On the basis of very limited observation , I 've tentatively concluded people tend to exceed the speed limit - no matter how high you set it .
I do n't know about that .
The Autobahn in Germany still has many stretches with no speed limit at all .
Most people seem to like to drive at around 130 km/h ( approx - 78 mph ) .
There 's always the BMWs that are driving in excess of 100 mph but for the most part it seems that around 130 km/h is a speed that most people like to drive- myself included .

Ah , but inconveniencing them was the only way to make them think about their situation .
100 % drive over the limit , but only 50 % want it to increase .
The other 50 % are perfectly happy driving faster , but want the cops to stoppeople who are going as fast as they are .

I drive 402 and 401 a few times a year .
Even though the limit is 62 mph , I usually do my customary 75 - 78 .
Even passed a couple of OPP ( Ontario Provincial Police ) with no problems .
I contend that a driver gets bored at slow speeds and loses their concentration .
That 's when accidents occur .
When you 're kicking it a bit , you have a heightened sense of awareness and become a better driver .
On the flip side , I was intentionally run off the road by some moron in a Kenworth .
he chased me for about 5 miles at sapeeds in excess of 85 m ph .
( BTW , my wife and three kids were in the car and visible as well )
At one point , he changed lanes , so I stayed where I was and backed off .
Moron jumped into my lane and sent me off into the rocks on the shoulder .
I 'm a real good driver , but not that good .
As I was sliding down the freeway sideways at 80 , obviously the hand of the Lord was on my wheel .
I had a long talk with his boss the next day .
If you care , it was Gerth Transport out of Kitchener .
Sorry about the long post , I just get a little excited when someone tries to kill my family .

It should be noted that since most drivers tend to drive prudently , speed enforcement tends to be focused on places where speeding is not dangerous .
The places where speeding really is dangerous , most people are prudent enough to drive slowly and there are n't enough maniacs to pay for enforcement efforts .

This tactic of driving in tandem at precisely the posted speed limit was used to great effect in the successful efforts of the National Motorists '
Association to repeal the national 55 mph speed limit in the US .
As annoying as it may be , it 's effective .

For years , he was the booze - soaked bard of the barstool , the keeper of ' a bad liver and a broken heart ' .
But Tom Waits was saved by his wife , has n't had a drink for more than a decade and , at 56 , is making the music of his life .
Interview by Sean O'Hagan
When Tom Waits was a boy , he heard the world differently .
Sometimes , it sounded so out - of - kilter , it scared him .
The rustle of a piece of paper could make him wince , the sound of his mother tucking him in at night might cause him to curl up as if in pain .
' It was n't a cool thing , ' he says , shaking his head lest there be any doubt .
' It was a frightening thing .
I mean , I thought I was mentally ill , that maybe I was retarded .
I 'd put my hand on a sheet like this [ rubbing his shirt ] and it'd sound like sandpaper .
Or a plane going by .'
He is rocking back and forward on his seat as he recalls this and you can tell that traces of it still linger .
' I think I was having a spell , ' he says , his creased , weather - beaten face crinkling even more .
' It would descend upon me at night when the house got quiet , and I 'd say to myself , " Uh - oh , here they come again . " '
He rocks some more .
They ?
I say , surprised .
Did he think he was possessed ?
' I really did n't know .
Could n't figure it out .'
Did he tell anyone ?
' I think I told my mum .
I 'm not sure .
See , I thought I 'd outgrow it .
Like acne .
Or masturbation . '
And he did eventually , though the thought of it still haunts him .
' I 've read that other people , artistic people , have experienced it , too , ' he says , still rocking .
' They 've had periods where there was a distortion to the world that disturbed them . '
So , here we are , 50 - odd years later , and Tom Waits has made a career out of distorting the world in an often disturbing way .
His songs often sound like they have been bashed out of shape , put through a wringer , then left to dry in the sun until they are parched and somehow pure of spirit .
On his new album , Orphans , which is really three albums in one , he grabs hold of a few songs belonging to other singers .
Daniel Johnston's ' King Kong ' becomes a bestial howl of despair , even more odd than the original .
He scares the daylights out of the Disney standard ' Heigh Ho ' , from Snow White , turning it into what sounds like a slave song set to the pounding of an ogre 's hammer .
' I like to go for that broken - down feel , ' he says , ' the disintegration of it all . '
Orphans is a big , sprawling map of disintegration , a triple album containing 54 songs , 30 of which are brand new , while the rest have been gathered up from various one - off projects , film soundtracks and stage plays .
His wife , Kathleen , once said there were two types of Tom Waits songs , ' the grim reapers and the grand weepers ' , but Orphans suggest there are at least three .
' Brawlers ' is made up of blues stomps and raw rockers ; ' Bawlers ' is full of those beautiful , broken - down ballads of his that always sound oddly familiar , and ' Bastards ' is a series of fits and starts , noisy outbursts that range from the cantankerous to the unhinged .
It 's the first time in over 20 albums that Waits has divided his music along such generic lines .
I figure that , at 56 , he 's finally mellowing out .
' Do n't know ' bout that , ' he says , sounding even more gruff than usual , maybe a little offended .
' Just thought it would make for easier listening if I put them in categories .
It 's a combination platter , rare and new .
Some of it is only a few months old , and some of it is like the dough you have left over so you can make another pie . '
And one song stands out .
Called ' Road to Peace ' , it concerns the Middle East conflict .
It 's not the kind of song he usually sings , though his last album also contained an anti-war song called ' The Day after Tomorrow ' .
This one is angrier .
' I was pissed off , ' he sighs , rubbing his eyes .
' Started with a line I read in the paper one day : " He studied so hard it was as if he had a future . "
It was about this kid who got blown up in a suicide bomb on a bus in Israel .
They say God does n't give you anything he knows you can't handle .
Well , I do n't know if I believe that .'
He 'll probably get his ass kicked , I say , for the line '... why are we arming the Israeli Army with guns and tanks and bullets ? '
He nods .
' Maybe .
Maybe .
But , we are .
That 's just a fact .
I guess any time anyone from outside a situation voices an opinion , it 's going to be , " Who the fuck are you ? "
Do n't matter what side you 're on .
But this song ain't about taking sides , it 's an indictment of both sides .
I tried to be as equitable as possible .'
The places and the incidents referred to in the song are all real , and the names of the people , too .
He 's well aware , he says , of the risk of making a song carry that kind of weight .
' I do n't really know what a song like that can achieve , but I was compelled to write it .
I do n't know if any genuine meaningful change could ever result from a song .
It 's kind of like throwing peanuts at a gorilla . '
Waits talks like he sings , in a rasping drawl and with an old - timer 's wealth of received wisdom .
It 's as if , in late middle - age , he has grown into the person he always wanted to be .
His tales are often tall , and his metaphors and similes tend towards the surreal .
' Writing songs is like capturing birds without killing them , ' he quips .
' Sometimes you end up with nothing but a mouthful of feathers . '
We are sitting out the back of the Little Amsterdam oyster bar , half an hour 's drive north of Petaluma , where they filmed Peggy Sue Got Married .
It 's the only diner with a windmill out front .
Tom 's kind of place : a slightly run-down Dutch diner where Mariachi bands used to play at weekends until the owner 's entertainment licence was revoked after he got busted for having an illegal trailer park out the back .
Tom 's signed the petition like everybody else who passes through .
Outside , as far as the eye can see , there are gently rolling sun-burnished hills , tall trees , grazing cattle .
It could be Tuscany except for the sign that says ' Open for Hamburgers ' .
This is Tom 's home turf .
He lives further on up the road somewhere , on a ranch deep in Napa Valley near Santa Rosa .
These days ,
Waits does not stray far from home ; the musicians come to him .
His tours tend to be short , and not very often .
' Gotta keep 'em hungry , ' he quips .
' You know what they say , " Do n't feed the dolphins or they 'll poke a hole in your boat next time you go out . " '
Around the back of the Little Amsterdam , near the ancient rubbish bins and the furniture that has died from overuse , we are seated at a rickety table beside an old broken - down , rain - warped piano .
Waits is drinking black coffee from a paper cup , wearing a suit at least one size too small , scuffed biker boots and a weather - beaten look that says , ' I 've seen it all . '
His hair is thinner now , but still has a mind of its own .
His guitar is nestling in a case on the tarmac , on which rests a well - worn porkpie hat .
He could have just stepped out of one of his own songs .
' Just look at this piano , ' he says , the voice low and hoarse , and just the way you 'd imagine it to be from his singing .
' Why has this piano been left out in the rain ?
It will never have a song pass through its chambers again .
That 's a sad thing , right ? '
I look at the piano , discarded and battered beyond repair by the elements , and I nod .
It is a sad thing .
Sad enough to end up in a Tom Waits song .
This is exactly the kind of place where the famously wayward piano in ' The Piano has been Drinking ( Not Me ) ' might have ended up .
Coincidentally , we 've just been talking about drinking , and about losing your way in the fog that can sometimes settle on a life when a person loses track of where he is , who he is , and where the hell he was going .
Way back , when I first stumbled on Tom Waits while rooting though a friend 's record collection , every song seemed to be about drinking and losing your way in the fog .
His first record was even called ' Closing Time ' , but it sounded more like a lock - in at the loneliest bar in the world .
Just
Tom in the corner slumped over the piano serenading the last few nighthawks with his slurred songs about heartaches and hangovers , and the girl that got away .
His persona had already been perfected by the time he started living in the Tropicana Motel in Los Angeles in 1975 , a faded establishment that also housed a couple of aristocratic junkies and several call girls who worked Sunset Strip .
For six albums on Asylum Records , from his aforementioned debut in 1973 to 1980 's Heartattack and Vine , Waits was the gravel - voiced , beer - stained bard of the barstool , a latter - day beatnik with a bad liver and a broken heart , whose fans were few and far between , but utterly devoted .
And , boy , did he pay his dues .
' I opened for Frank Zappa , for John Prine , Martha and the Vandellas , Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee , ' he says now , sighing at the memory of those never - ending tours , the Godforsaken juke joints and the bounced cheques .
' I even opened for Buffalo Bob .
Got to take it where you find it .'
Buffalo Bob , for the uninitiated , was a children 's television star who made his name in the Fifties with an old - fashioned puppet show .
' Used to watch him when I was four years old , ' laughs Waits .
' Now I 'm opening for him in Atlanta .
Every night he'd fill my piano with candy .
Used to call me Tommy .
I got him in a headlock one night , said , " You call me Tommy any more , I 'll snap your head off . " '
Back then , I saw Waits die a slow death in Ronnie Scott 's , during a residency that nearly drove him over the edge .
' Supporting Monty Alexander , ' he says , dryly .
' Got in a fight with Pete King [ the promoter ] .
We did n't see eye to eye .
I was young and naive .
I was new to everything and far from home . '
For a long while , it looked like Waits would remain a cult figure , out on the furthermost horizon of the Seventies music scene , a stumblebum troubadour raised on bourbon and Bukowski .
His music suggested and , to a lesser degree , still suggests , that the Sixties utterly passed him by ; that , in his self - contained universe , the Beats were far more important than the Beatles , and Sinatra took precedence over the Stones .
' You imitate what you grow up around , ' he says , when I mention this .
' If you grow up around Sinatra , Crosby and Louis Armstrong as a kid , it goes in and stays in .
But some of that Sixties stuff went in too . '
He was born Thomas Alan Waits in Pomona , California , on 7 December 1949 .
Both his parents were schoolteachers , but his comfortable middle - class childhood was ruptured when they divorced in 1960 .
This may have been around the time when he started hearing the world differently .
It was definitely the moment he became obsessed with finding another father .
I had read somewhere that , as a child growing up in San Diego , he could n't wait to get old , that he'd even pretend to be an old guy , wearing a hat and talking to the neighbours about hi-fi and home insurance .
Salvation of a sort came when he discovered Kerouac and Ginsberg in the Sixties , literary hipsters from the previous decade .
Until his wife came along two decades later , the Beat writers were his most important influence .
He pays homage to them one more time on Orphans , singing Kerouac 's forlorn road song ' Home I 'll Never Be ' , and reciting Bukowski 's beautiful poem ' Nirvana ' , both , in their own way , odes to rootlessness , restlessness , the fleeting , irrevocable moment when things could have been different .
The essence , in fact , of a good many Tom Waits songs .
Why , I ask , were the Beats so crucial to him ?
' They were father figures , ' he says softly , his long fingers tracing small circles in the coffee spill on the table .
' They were the ones I looked to for guidance .
See , my dad left when I was 10 , so I was always looking for a dad .
It was like , " Are you my dad ?
Are you my dad ?
What about you ?
Are you my dad ? "
I found a lot of these old salty guys along the way . '
The trains that turn up again and again in his songs also hint at a childhood restlessness , an urge for going that would stay with him until he met the woman he would marry .
' When I was a kid and we went on a car trip , ' he says , sounding wistful , 'it seemed like we had to stop and wait for a train to go by every two miles .
Seemed like there were train crossings everywhere , nothing but train crossings . '
In adolescence , that restlessness grew profound .
Waits left home when he was 15 , finding temporary work first as a cook and later as a night - club bouncer .
He was constantly on the move , often living out of his car , always writing songs .
On the likes of Small Change and Blue Valentine , you can hear the lipstick traces of countless torch singers , as well as echoes of Sinatra 's gloriously woebegone album , In the Wee Small Hours .
His voice , though , kept fame at bay , and was once memorably described by a reviewer as ' that of a drunken hobo arguing with a deli owner over the price of a bowl of soup ' .
As wonderful as many of those early albums are , the act was wearing thin .
So , too , was his ambition , his spirit .
In 1977 , he fell for the singer Rickie Lee Jones , whose wayward life echoed his own , and whose most famous song , ' Chuck E's in Love ' , paid homage to their mutual friend Chuck E Weiss .
Waits and Weiss were arrested that same year for disturbing the peace in Duke 's Tropicana Coffee Shop .
His life was unravelling .
' I had a problem , ' he says , matter - of - factly .
' An alcohol problem , which a lot of people consider an occupational hazard .
My wife saved my life .'
Kathleen Brennan was a scriptwriter whom Waits met in 1978 , while just starting out on his other , more fitful career as a character actor .
The two first crossed paths on the set of Paradise Alley , a vehicle for the young Sylvester Stallone , with a bit part for Waits , who played a version of himself , a pianist called Mumbles .
Brennan and Waits were married in 1980 , just a year after he had split with Jones , who would later say , ' What Tom wanted to do was live in a bungalow with screaming kids and spend Saturday nights at the movies . '
There was a lot more to it than that , though .
An Illinois farm girl from Irish Catholic stock , Kathleen was the catalyst for the dramatic sea-change in Waits 's music that occurred with the release of Swordfishtrombones in 1983 .
' I did n't just marry a beautiful woman , ' he says , ' I married a record collection . '
The songs he writes with Kathleen are often filled with echoes of older songs .
A new song called ' Widow 's Grove ' begins with a melody borrowed from the old Irish song ' The Rose of Tralee ' .
He married Kathleen in Tralee .
On Orphans , you can also hear traces of John Lee Hooker and John McCormack , the Louvin Brothers and the Clancy Brothers .
His record collection , and her's .
' It 's all in there , ' he smiles .
' Crop failures , dad dying , train wrecks .
It all gets handed down , and everything you absorb you 're going to secrete .
A lot of those old songs stick to you , and others blow right through you , and some of them get trapped in there .
You keep hearing them every time you sit down at the piano . '
Kathleen has been his collaborator for almost 25 years now .
They have three children , Casey , Kelly and Sullivan , and Casey currently plays drums in his dad 's band .
When Waits was once asked what his wife brought to the table , he replied , ' Blood and liquor and guilt . '
Which is handy , because Waits himself has n't had a drink for 14 years .
When he says that Kathleen saved his life , he means it literally .
' Oh yeah , for sure , ' he continues , rocking back and forth again .
' But I had something in me , too .
I knew I would not go down the drain , I would not light my hair on fire , I would not put a gun in my mouth .
I had something abiding in me that was moving me forward .
I was probably drawn to her because I saw that there was a lot of hope there . '
Given that his early songs , his voice and his persona , were drenched in drink , how hard was it for him to give up ?
' Oh , you know , it was tough .
I went to AA .
I 'm in the programme .
I 'm clean and sober .
Hooray .
But , it was a struggle . '
Does he miss the odd night - cap ?
' Miss drinking ? ' he says , sounding genuinely surprised .
' Nah .
Not the way I was drinking .
No , I 'm happy to be sober .
Happy to be alive .
I found myself in some places I can't believe I made it out of alive . '
That bad , huh ?
' Oh yeah .
People with guns .
People with gunshot wounds .
People with heavy drug problems .
People who carried guns everywhere they went , always had a gun .
You live like that , ' he says , without a trace of irony , ' you attract lower company . '
I ask if he wrote a different kind of song when he was drinking .
He thinks about this for an instant , then says , ' No .
I do n't think so .
I mean , one is never completely certain when you drink and do drugs whether the spirits that are moving through you are the spirits from the bottle or your own .
And , at a certain point , you become afraid of the answer .
That 's one of the biggest things that keeps people from getting sober , they 're afraid to find out that it was the liquor talking all along . '
For a while , Waits had that fear himself , the fear that when he finally dried out the songs would dry up , too .
He worked through it , though .
' I was trying to prove something to myself , too , ' he says , revealingly .
' It was like , " Am I genuinely eccentric ?
Or am I just wearing a funny hat ? "
All the big questions come up when you get sober .
" What am I made of ?
What 's left when you drain the pool ? " '
Pushing my luck , I ask what was the first album he made when he was clean and serene .
It turns out to be a question too far .
' First sober album ? ' he says , suddenly sounding slightly tetchy .
' Well , if it matters to anybody other than me ...'
The sentence trails off and hangs in the air , unfinished .
' I do n't know if I want to answer that , ' he says finally .
' That 's a kind of personal thing . '
Instead , we talk some more about songs and songwriting , the essential mystery of it all .
You can tell he respects his gift , nurtures it , and does n't ever take it for granted ; that he has a faith in the song that is almost spiritual .
Lately , that faith has started to pay off commercially .
His last album , 2004 's Real Gone , a rugged affair even by Waits 's standards , followed 1999 's Mule Variations into the American and British pop charts .
Before that , he had only ever dented the mainstream by proxy , when other people covered his songs , most notably Rod Stewart , who took ' Downtown Train ' into the Top Ten .
The actor Scarlett Johansson has just announced her plan to record an entire album of Waits 's songs next year .
As our allotted time runs out , and Waits grows fidgety , we start trading favourite songs , stories , jokes .
He has a good one about Barry Manilow and a pair of Siamese twins .
Finally , I ask him about ' Fanning Street ' , a windswept Waitsian ballad from Orphans that has intrigued me since I first heard it , not least because it borrows a title , and maybe even a mood , from an old blues song by the legendary Leadbelly .
' Well , he died the day after I was born - 8 December 1949 , ' says Waits .
' I always felt like I connected with him somehow .
He was going out and I was coming in .
And , maybe we passed in the hall .
I would love to have seen Leadbelly play , but that 's the great thing about records , you put them on and those guys are right there in the room .
They 're back . '
He picks up his hat and slaps the dust off it .
' I think about that sometimes .
Some day I 'm gonna be gone and people will be listening to my songs and conjuring me up .
In order for that to happen , you gotta put something of yourself in it .
Kinda like a time capsule .
Or making a voodoo doll .
You gotta wrap it with thread , put a rock inside the head , then use two sticks and something from a spider web .
You gotta put it all in there to make a song survive . '
I tell him I think he 's safe enough on that score .
And they 'll be lingering in the air long after both of us are gone , the best Tom Waits songs .
Like shadows , like ghosts , like echoes .
· Orphans is released by Anti-Records on 20 November
So if you fly into yourself while watching you , um , fly into yourself does that break some kind of space - time continuum ?
Video of that would definitely win the big prize on AFV !

We 're one of the first people who grumbles whenever we walk past a handicap parking spot and see some Prada - wearing and Gucci - carrying trophy wife unable to walk the extra 30 feet from her Hummer to the door of the local Whole Foods .
We mean , come on — why do we get the hassle from the 5 - 0 when we 're not coming to a complete stop at a deserted intersection , but a man in blue ain't around for li'l miss when she gets out of her car .
That being said , somebody please tell us why Paris Hilton is able to do what today 's Page Six claims :
PARIS Hilton looked able - bodied last time we looked , but she 's been parking in a space reserved for handicapped drivers .
Residents of a posh Los Angeles apartment complex that 's home to her boy toy , Cardinals quarterback Matt Leinart , say every time she visits , the celebutard thoughtlessly pulls into the handicapped spot ...

Maybe " celebutard " is a Los Angeles - only disease — does this mean she 'll get a telethon ?
Of course if it 's not — we can't wait for the pics of her SLR getting towed !

It is hard to even begin to learn the cutting edge of functional language theory these days without talking about monads .
In languages running in a purely functional manner , monads offer a way of dealing with the outside environment in a safe and controlled manner .
In a pure environment , monads provide us a way to carry data computations via pure functional composition and still have computations that happen " on the side . "
A lot of research into functional languages requires a solid understanding of monads and thus to apply their results to the Qi programming language , I 'll define a few monad operations here and define a type theory that can handle the list monadSince you can find a wide variety of monads for the language Haskell , I will start by describing monads in Haskell and use that to define representations inside of the Qi language .
Basically , a monad is a type that defines two operations .
The operations are " lift " and " pipe " .
In Haskell , they are often called " return " and " bind " respectively .
As long at the two functions hold the following identities , we can consider the type to be a monad .
Here is a definition of the rules a monad must follow in a pure version of scheme .
In Haskell , the Monad m class is defined byWe can see that return " lifts " a value of type a into the monad class m a .
Bind takes in a monad of type " a " and a function that takes in a value of type " a " and gives a monad of type " b " .
Bind then returns to us a monad of type " b " where the monad " a " has been transformed by the function into a monad of type " b " .
Once we have these two functions working as defined , we have a monad .
Notice that we have not defined these functions yet .
Haskell allows us to define a higher order type that we promise that all implementations of the type will have the listed functions and they will match the given type signatures .
These sorts of definitions are not as easy in Qi , yet .
One of the basic monad types in Haskell is the list monad .
We define list monads as having type Monad [ ] and we can make a set of functions that follow the monad laws over Monad [ ] 's .
Let us rewrite these rules in Qi .
Well that was easy !
Let us try out this new monad ...
We 'll take a list of [ 10 20 30 ] and a function that takes an X and returns [ X X+1 ] and give it to bind to see what it does with it .
So far , so good .
Let us check the monad laws to see if this version follows those laws .
Law 1 says that ( bind ( return X ) F ) == ( F X ) Law 2 says ( bind Monad return ) == MonadLaw 3 says that ( bind ( bind Monad F ) G ) = ( bind Monad ( /. X ( pipe ( F X ) G ) ) )
So we have proven that our monad list does in fact honor the monad laws .
However , we are not running the type checker in Qi on this problem , so the monad we get is the same one that we can get in any functional language .
We have to wait until runtime to see the error of the following attempt at using a monad .
So now the question becomes , can we get a monad into the TYPED version of Qi.
Firstly , we must note that Qi has no notion of polymorphic type overloading .
Hence we cannot easily make a general purpose " bind " operator that all monads can use .
We also should note that the type checker treats a polymorphic list as a special case , and thus we cannot perform a direct translation like the one from Haskell .
In some way , we will have to contain our lists in another type .
Let us take the simplest translation .
If something is of type ( list A ) then we can make a monadic list type of ( monad list A ) via the following sequent rules .
Monadic lists are simply lists inside of a container list and any list in a container can be a monad list of that type .
We should read this as saying , " We can construct monads from lists by adding a list around it and we can construct lists from monads . "
We note that Qi allows you to go back from a monadic representation to the list based one as long as you properly use the type .
Unfortunately , Qi has no notion of modules so we cannot seal off this behaviour from other functions in our code .
Continuing , we will define some helper functions to allow us to manipulate the monad data structure inside the instance functions .
Of course , Qi has no notion of either class or instance and allows us to pull lists from monads .
But if we ignore these quirks for the moment , we can define a reasonable monad list type that works .
I include a constructor function " list_monad " and a few internal data access helpers .
Our m_ functions and join properly deal with getting ( list A ) 's from their containers and putting them back in .
Join has to take the job of flatten and check for the end of a list and if we find it , drop it from the " Final " list .
This accounts for the if statement in the function .
It obviously makes heavy use of the data manipulation functions which lowers legability .
We can read it as saying , " Take the first element head of the list ( remember that we have a monad list of a monad lists here ) and put it on the final list .
Then take the rest of that head list and put it back on the processing queue .
The Final output list is built in reverse order so we are forced to reverse the computation at the end of the join .
Not pretty , but it works for the purpose of monad construction .
Now we are in a position to define " bind " and " return " as before .
Note that we basically take the list out of the monad container and apply normal list functions to it , wrapping it up back in the monad container when we return .
Testing it out gives :
And our monad type is certainly not a listNow let us assure ourselves that our monad list is polymorphic to type A .
We now define a fractal symbol function f.
And let us use it with our monad functionsSo there you have it , a very simple , poorly performing basic list monad of polymorphic type A in the Qi Programming Language .
Feel free to offer any questions or criticism that you have .
Thanks for reading .

Alistair Cooke died in 2004 at the age of 95
Over 1,000 body parts were plundered by gangs in New York and then sold for transplants , it has been claimed .
Biomedical Tissue Services , the firm at the centre of the scandal , exported 77 body parts to the UK last year .
NHS regulator , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , said it had alerted 20 NHS trusts .
We would say any risk is minimum and this is just a precautionary measure
MHRA spokeswoman
Late last year , the US Food and Drug Administration ordered a recall of the potentially tainted products and warned that many patients could have been exposed to HIV and other diseases , but insisted the risk of infection was minimal .
New York investigators say death certificates were doctored to make the dead out to have been younger and healthier than they actually were .
The tissue , in the form of skin , bone and tendons , was later sold for use in procedures like dental implants and hip replacements .
Four people have pleaded not guilty to the charges .
The body of veteran BBC broadcaster Alistair Cooke , who died of cancer aged 95 in March 2004 , was reported to have been caught up in the case .
Infected
A spokeswoman for the MHRA said : " It 's not to say that the 77 body parts that were brought in came from stolen cadavers or were infected .
" But they did come from Biomedical Tissue Services and we alerted hospitals of this earlier in the year . "
She added it was up to individual doctors to decide what to do in regards to removing the implants or deciding it was less risk to leave them in .
The body parts were all pieces of bone which were grafted on to patients needing hip or jaw operations .
The MHRA would not say exactly where in the UK the imported parts were sent because the procedures were unusual enough that the patients involved could be identified .
And the spokeswoman added : " We would say any risk is minimum and this is just a precautionary measure . "
For the ultra-rich , it involves investing millions in an original Warhol or Picasso .
For others , it will be gold , silver or rare stamps .
Economists are puzzling over how almost every type of asset - commodities , property , precious metals , shares , bonds and even art - are testing dizzying new price levels .
This parallel rise in all asset prices is unheard of in economic history .
Traditionally , when commodities go up , stock markets go down .
Stock markets do n't like soaring commodity prices , which have in the past translated rapidly into higher inflation and higher interest rates .
But the link appears - for now - to have broken .
This week global stock markets hit a new high , finally surpassing the " new economy " peak during the dotcom boom of 1999 / 2000 .
The Dow Jones average in New York rose again yesterday , and is just few points short of its all - time high of 11,722 on January 19 2000 .
So , now a way has emerged for the more humble investor to make a killing on the international markets .
Yesterday the price of copper hit an all - time record of $ 8,000 a tonne , driven by frantic buying and selling by commodity brokers and futures traders .
But a little - noticed fact is that every 2 p piece made before 1992 is 97 % copper - meaning that each coin contains 6.9g of the metal .
Collect together 145 of them , and you 've got a kilo 's worth of copper .
Now , just find another 999kg , a total of 145,000 coins , and you 've got a tonne .
On their face value , those coins are worth just £ 2,900 .
But taking them to a scrap merchant and selling them on the open market for their metal content will make you a cool £ 1,500 profit , especially if you throw in the 25kg of zinc that are also sitting in your goldmine of loose change .
The same trick can be pulled off with pennies , so long as they were circulated before September 1992 , when the Royal Mint introduced new 1 p and 2 p coins made from steel with only a thin copper plating .
For a 50 % return on an original investment , that 's very good even for the likes of George Soros .
It 's not just copper that is booming in price : gold this week broke through the $ 700 - an - ounce level for the first time in 25 years , representing a 250 % gain since 2001 alone .
In New York , auction houses are achieving breathtaking new prices for modern art , with the buyers believed to be Russian billionaires on an oil and commodity - fuelled spending spree .
At Christie 's in New York on Tuesday night , a world record was set for one of Andy Warhol 's Campbell 's soup cans .
The £ 6.3 m paid for Small Torn Campbell 's Soup Can ( 1962 ) was the highest ever for one of the images that heralded the birth of pop art .
Works by Damien Hirst and David Hockney also achieved record prices , although nowhere near the £ 51.5 m paid for Picasso's Dora Maar au Chat last week .
In the secretive art world , the identity of the Picasso buyer is unknown , but speculation is growing that it was a Russian steel magnate .
Just as puzzling is the behaviour of gold .
Market folklore has it that gold goes up in price when investors are looking for a safe haven during choppy economic times , yet all the major global indicators - economic growth , inflation and unemployment - are relatively benign .
Meanwhile , the much - heralded UK property crash failed to materialise ; instead the boom moved to the United States , where house prices have surged dramatically .
In the late 1990s market traders talked of the " goldilocks economy " of surging productivity and growth , to justify eye - watering valuations of some companies .
Today the buzzword is the " super- cycle " , an expansion in demand for commodities that could last for decades and which has at its core one factor : China .
In the first quarter of 2006 China posted breakneck economic growth of 10.2 % , sucking in commodities and guzzling petroleum on a phenomenal scale .
Low interest rates are the underpinning for the super - cycle , providing the cheap money for traders to speculate in assets .
But yesterday Legal & General , one of the biggest investors on the London stock market , joined the growing chorus of voices predicting a soggy end to the boom .
It warned that global bottlenecks will stoke up inflation and force central banks , led by the US Federal Reserve , to raise interest rates and choke off the boom .
Even in China wages ( which are still only 3 % of US labour rates ) are beginning to rise strongly : in the Shenzhen region at the core of Chinese manufacturing , workers will receive a 23 % rise in minimum wages in July .
Meanwhile , the message from art history is that when sudden wealth on a vast scale is poured into buying art , a slump wo n't be far away .
In 1990 the buyers were Japanese billionaires and the target was Van Goghs .
The Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito stunned the art world by bidding $ 82.5 m for Portrait of Dr Gachet .
Just weeks later , when the Japanese central bank raised interest rates , the art market collapsed as the loans used to buy the art works went sour .
Portrait of Dr Gachet remains the art world 's most enduring mystery .
Saito died in 1996 , and the whereabouts of the Van Gogh masterpiece is today unknown .
' OW MUCH IS IT THEN ?

Thomas Homer - Dixon : Is the Deadly Crash of Our Civilization Inevitable ?
My difference with Diamond is that I do n't think we 're going to really begin those conversations in a proper way until we face some crises or breakdowns .
In other words , my impression of his argument is that collapse is something we have to avoid , in all cases and in all forms .
On the other hand , I believe there is a spectrum of forms of collapse .
At one end is the ideal , optimistic future where we solve all our problems and we live happily every after .
At the other end is catastrophic collapse .
We have tended not to fill in all the spaces in between , but that 's actually where things might be very interesting .
There may be some forms of disruption and crisis that will actually stimulate us to be really creative .
Most importantly , they may allow us to get the deep vested interests that are blocking change out of the way .
... The key thing though -- and this is where I think that Jared Diamond 's argument just does n't give us the purchase that we need -- is that we have to keep the breakdown from being catastrophic .
There has to be enough resilience in the system , enough information , enough adaptive capacity that things can be regenerated .
With catastrophic breakdown , recovery is often impossible .

Good Sports
I reckon , in the next few years , as a result of caps on emissions and peak oil being reached , that we can say goodbye to international sports and most national sports .
The idea that you could fly people and teams all over America , all over the globe , all the time , just to play sport , is so late twentieth century .
Fifty years ago it was still something of a novelty to see people flying to play sport .
Now it is taken for granted .

By January 2009 we will surely be reeling from the " work out " of peak financial excess represented by the hedge fund fiesta and the reckless mortgage fiasco ( from which the housing industry as we have known it will never recover ) .
By 1/20/09 ( inauguration day ) the global oil crisis will be accepted as self - evident even by Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( and its clients in the oil industry ) .
By 1/20/09 , we will have gone through two more global warming hurricane seasons .

Ethanol 's growth and implications for grain producers
In Iowa , combined corn processing capacity for ethanol and other corn products will soon be equivalent to more than half of the 2006 Iowa corn crop .
If all planned plants are built , processing capacity would be equivalent to 133 % of last year 's crop -- within three to five years .
At the national level , existing processing capacity and plants under construction or being expanded will likely boost total capacity to the equivalent of about 40 % of last year 's corn production -- within the next 15 to 18 months .
If all planned and proposed corn-based plants in the United States were built , corn processing capacity would exceed the 2006 U.S. crop by at least one - fifth .
Current returns for processing corn into ethanol are quite favorable .
Attributes of best biofuel : Cost - efficient , eco-friendly
Additionally , these crops are not sustainable .
When crops are harvested , the embedded nutrients are removed and not replaced through the natural process of recycling dead plants back into the land to provide nutrients for the next generation .
Ethanol production uses large amounts of water , which could exacerbate the water shortage worldwide , which is already occurring in some arid countries .
Another factor : Farm machinery and vehicles burn fossil fuels to harvest and transport the crops .
This process contributes considerable amounts of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , to the atmosphere .
A battle over biofuels
While nearly 80 percent of Americans favor increased use of ethanol to ease our " addiction " to oil , there is still concern that ethanol 's demand for corn will create grain shortages that drive up the cost of food .
Brazil Ethanol Can Replace 10 % World Gasoline
In 20 Yrs
If the right investments are made , Brazil could replace 10 % of the world 's gasoline with its bio- friendly cane - based ethanol in 20 years ' time , according to a study conducted by a university in Sao Paulo at the request of the country 's Ministry of Science and Technology .
New Fuels Have Huge Potential To Reduce Gasoline Use
New vehicle fuels and related technologies offer the greatest potential for large reductions in gasoline use and the U.S. economy ’s dependence on petroleum , a White House report says .
' Elephant grass ' may be the next big biomass crop
If your corn is being processed into ethanol and your soybeans into biodiesel , your acreage unsuited for row crop production may soon be converted to production of miscanthus , a biomass crop that some researchers believe will help fill the shortfall in U.S. energy production .
Britain tries to block European targets for renewable energy
Britain is trying to block new European rules that would set binding targets on renewable energy generation to tackle climate change , according to leaked papers .
The European commission wants to force member states to generate 20 % of their energy by 2020 from green sources such as wind power and wood chip boilers .
But Britain has argued against such a binding goal , saying countries need the " flexibility " to set their own targets .

Politics to complicate energy conflicts
Energy - producing nations with state - owned oil and gas firms will continue to flex their muscles on the world stage , causing more confrontations , according to a panelist at Saturday ’s energy symposium .
And the volatile mix of oil and nationalism will bring dire consequences to energy consumer nations such as the United States , said Nikolay Bogachev , chairman of Yamal LNG of Moscow , Russia .
Energy critical power source within N Korea
In the depths of the North Korean winter , where temperatures regularly plumb - 10 ºC , government offices and even hospital wards in Pyongyang are so cold that people can see their breath indoors .
Lights – not to mention medical equipment – constantly flicker on and off .
In the industrial areas along the east coast , the vast majority of factories and mines simply lie idle .
... “ North Korea ’s power plants were already 40 years out of date [ when the Soviet Union collapsed ] but they ca n’t repair them because they do n’t have the energy to make spare parts , which is causing them to deteriorate further , ” says Timothy Savage of the Nautilus Institute , a think - tank that has done extensive studies of the North ’s energy sector .
“ Their whole energy system is held together with chewing gum and baling wire . ”
North Korea agrees to nuclear disarmament
The North must provide a complete list of its nuclear programs and disable all existing nuclear facilities .
In return , the North will get aid in corresponding steps worth 950,000 tons of heavy fuel oil — details of which will be addressed in later working group discussions .

Vietnam predicted to import coal from 2015
Vietnam is forecast to have to import some kinds of coal , mainly fat coal used for metallurgy , from 2015 , local newspaper Vietnam Economic Times on Tuesday quoted the country 's Industry Ministry as reporting .
The ministry predicted that Vietnam would have to import 5.9 million tons of some kinds of coal in 2015 , 15.4 million tons in 2020 , and 54.4 million tons in 2025 , to serve increasing demand for the fossil fuel of its energy - thirsty industries , including metallurgy and thermoelectricity .

Activist : Oil crisis requires drastic changes in Madison
Local activist Jan Sweet envisions a city without cars , or at least a compromise - a hybrid city , which would function like a hybrid car and conserve oil .
Oil prices prove to be a tricky economy indicator
At the time it was widely believed this particular oil crisis was different from previous crises , being driven by surging demand – particularly from emerging economies such as India and China – rather than due to a supply shock .
On top of these demand - driven concerns were the Cassandras who were vehemently arguing that the world was on the edge of a precipice and that " peak oil " – the peaking of world production – was at hand or even past .
These two factors were supposedly set to drive oil prices ever higher .
Biofuel is NOT “ Carbon - Neutral ”
Biofuel today is produced , overwhelmingly , from oil palms and sugar cane , and overwhelmingly , these plantations stand where tropical rainforest recently stood .
Over a year ago , a well - documented essay entitled “ Worse Than Fossil Fuel , ” was published in the London Guardian by George Monbiot , an environmental activist and professor at Oxford - Brookes University in the U.K .
In this article , Monbiot states “ Between 1985 and 2000 the development of oil - palm plantations was responsible for an estimated 87 per cent of deforestation in Malaysia .
In Sumatra and Borneo , some 4 million hectares of forest has been converted to palm farms .
Now a further 6 million hectares is scheduled for clearance in Malaysia , and 16.5 m in Indonesia . ”

One post at a time .
[ T ] here may be more here , just as there is to horror and catastrophe movies if you think about them .
Neo -Freudians , and especially Reichians , suggest that our form of civilization stifles and constricts us so much that at times we all long to experience some orgasmic but catastrophic " explosion , " like King Kong breaking his chains and wrecking New York , or even more like the masochist in bondage , according to Dr. Reich .
This sudden release from the bondage - and - discipline of our jobs and our taxes — actually called the Rapture by Fundamentalists — seems ghoulishly attractive to Christians , New Agers , and others who believe in a " spirit " that will survive the general wreckage .
In that case , the end of the world seems no worse than a visit to the dentist :
You know you 'll feel better afterwards .
This sort of desire for Total Escape / Total Annihilation has always had its bards and visionaries .

You can see why New Agers like this :

I have no commitment to materialism as a philosophy that explains everything , since no correlation of words can ever do that , and a philosophy is never more than a correlation of words .
But restricting myself to the " materialistic " / scientific method of asking questions that have definite experiential answers , I observe no difference in operation between " cults " and " religions . "
Catholic nuns and priests vowing celibacy seem no more or less weird than Heaven 's Gate members who also make that choice .
Mormon extraterrestrial cosmology seems as goofy as Scientology , etc . Religions and cults all use the same techniques of brain damage , or " mind control , " i.e. they all instill BS — Belief Systems .
Among the fundamentalists , the Antichrist is always considered a specific individual appearing only in the last days of Earth .
Recent candidates have included Aleister Crowley , Yasir Arafat , Prince Bernhard ( founder of the Bilderbergers ! ) , Henry Kissinger , Saddam Hussein , Mickey Mouse , Barney the Dinosaur , and even Ronald Reagan — whose full name , Ronald Wilson Reagan , has six letters in each word , thus yielding 6 - 6 - 6 .
Imagine what would happen if " many millions " of U.S. citizens said they had been sexually assaulted by aliens from Mexico or Iraq , instead of aliens from Outer Space .
Obviously , there would be no scientific taboo against investigating such cases , and Congress might even have declared war on the invaders by now .
If the subjects claimed , as most of Dr. Mack 's subjects do , that they now love their kidnappers and have received important ecological warnings from them , as well as learning from their extraterrestrial sermons about how wicked and wretched our society is , this would be considered evidence that they had been " brainwashed " as well as raped ( think Stockholm Syndrome ) .
The differences in scientific and political reactions to atrocities by human aliens and nonhuman aliens seem even more confusing than the rest of this mystery .
In 1997 , a jury awarded $ 2.4 million in damages to one Nadine Cool , who had sued her former therapist , Dr. Kenneth Olson , for malpractice .
He had convinced her , under hypnosis , that when she was a child her father had forced her to participate in Satanic rituals of human sacrifice .
He also convinced her that she possessed no fewer than 126 alternate personalities , including angels , demons and even a duck .
She had believed it all — including the duck — until she confronted her father with these hideous memories and he dropped dead of a heart attack .
As Weston La Barre pointed out a long time ago in his classic Ghost Dance : The Origins of Religion , you can find remnants of a primordial bear - god from the bottom of South America up over North America and over the North Pole and down across most of Europe and Asia .
This deity appears in cave paintings from southern France carbon - dated at 30,000 BC .
You can find him and her ( for this god is bisexual ) disguised in Artemis and Arduina and King Arthur , all unmasked via canny detective work by folklorists — and etymologists , who first spotted the bear - god when they identified the Indo - European root ard , meaning bear .
You can track the bear - god in dwindling forms in a hundred fairy tales from all over Europe and Asia .
And you can find the rituals of this still - living god among the indigenous tribes of both American continents .
of the passing of RAW to scan the pieces he wrote for his 1999 column on GettingIt.com , the progenitor of this webzine .
It was a casual act , under the assumption that they would be somewhat dated .
But as I reread the articles , it became clear that admirers who are unaware of them might in fact find them enjoyable .
So , here are their links , with excerpts : Sometimes , the Apocalypse can ruin your whole week .
Sounds like Zen to some , but others fear this is opening the door to Dr. Berman 's solipsism and the moon that is only there when we look at it ... Did you know that Bill Gates is the Antichrist ?
Well , you 've probably suspected it , but some people have set out to prove it ... Although few people remember this , Bugs Bunny was the first UFO " abductee " in a 1952 cartoon called " Hasty Hare .
" Or , worse yet , is it possible that Daffy Duck is the Devil ?
Keep an eye on your local media for further Feminist or Fundamentalist revelations .
I sort of think the fundies have it right for once .
Santa not only has an unsavory pagan ancestry but a rather criminal family history all around .

CONYERS AND PELOSI IGNORE COURT EVIDENCE , HALT IMPEACHMENT PROBE
Washington - February 13 , 2007 - TomFlocco.com -
House staffers in the office of Representative John Conyers ( D - 14 - MI ) and the offices of the House Judiciary Committee where Conyers is now Chairman both confirmed yesterday that the Democrats have taken any impeachment inquiry off the table despite recent revelations and court testimony that President Bush illegally took America to war in Iraq .
When we asked a female staffer in Conyers ’ office why the Chairman made the decision not to commence an impeachment inquiry regarding Mr. Bush ’s war crimes involving facilitation of corporate war profiteering , manipulation of WMD pre-war evidence , torture of prisoners along with spying on emails and phone calls of Americans , “ signing statements ” to change the interpretation of laws , and failure to assist border patrolmen involved in shootouts with Mexican drug - runners , we were told “ there will be no impeachment . ”
Our next phone call to the House Judiciary Committee office where all impeachment inquiries begin resulted in a statement that “ there are no plans to begin an impeachment investigation of President Bush , ” after which we were placed on hold to prevent further questions from being asked .
Last week MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews said “ It is a federal crime to take the country to war for no reason at all , ” but the Hardball host added that the Democrats probably wo n’t do anything about it .
This , as grand jury testimony in the trial of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff Lewis Scooter Libby revealed that President Bush authorized Cheney to have Libby leak information from the National Security assessment to reporters regarding weapons of mass destruction to help make a case for war .
And despite strong evidence of criminal acts perpetrated by the Bush administration , Chairman Conyers and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have made the decision not to hold President Bush and Vice President Cheney accountable for their “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
The important question is why ?
( More )
I promised an equal time post to my recent “ worst boss in the world ” rant and here it is .
A brief summary of the things you can do to totally reinforce the stereotype of IT workers being aloof , spoiled , uncommunicative and arrogant .
Although it may sound like I have intimate knowledge of the following workplace sins , this should n’t be taken as an admission of guilt on my part .
My lawyer advised me not to admit anything .
Talk in jargon
There are times when technical language is necessary to accurately describe things .
By and large , that ’s when you ’re talking to other techies .
It ’s rarely appropriate ( or useful ) to use technical jargon when talking to customers / business users .
If you simply ca n’t explain something to a non -IT person in a way they understand , that ’s what your project manager and / or business analyst are for .
If you ’re a PM or BA and you ca n’t talk without using jargon then there ’s a problem .
Treat anyone who does n’t understand your work as if they ’re stupid I ’m not going to argue whether or not the person in question is actually stupid , but it ’s wrong to treat them as if they ’re stupid .
Some people just have skills in different areas .
Your work probably requires quite a bit of intelligence .
The inability to do or understand your work is not by definition stupid .
Do n’t try to be clever about it either .
Too often I ’ve seen IT people who think nobody is picking up on their sarcasm when they ’re laying it on with a trowel .
Focus solely on technology Most IT workers love technology for its own sake , or at least they have a strong affinity for technology .
As admirable as it is to love your work , the technology itself is only half the picture when you work in IT .
The other half ( most often the half that controls what happens ) is the business , whatever that means in your case .
No matter how good a technology is objectively , the results it delivers to the business are what counts the most .
By and large , the business side could n’t care less about the relative merits of operating systems , hardware or software .
If you ca n’t sell a technology in terms of the results it will deliver for the business then you ’re in for an uphill battle .
Refuse to acknowledge when there ’s an issue
There ’s nothing that drives a user crazy like telling them they are n’t experiencing a problem .
And yes , often the biggest problem is the user themselves but reflexively assuming that the user is at fault is not going to win you any friends .
I ’ve seen this in multiple workplaces and read it on multiple online forums ; someone says system X or site Y is n’t working for them and the response is along the lines of “ well , I have a machine configured like this and I never have any problems . ”
Here ’s a tip : someone who ’s having a problem is n’t really interested in hearing about how swell everything ’s going for you .
Right or wrong , users want a solution , they do n’t want to be told that they are the problem .
Tell the boss ’s brother his idea is stupid OK , I did this one .
I thought it made me a good worker – pointing out a moron former model was an incompetent prat who only got to be head of a business unit because he was dropped out of the same vagina as the boss .
This was apparently not a universally held view and I did n’t last much longer at that job .
React aggressively to any perceived criticism
Go ahead .

Or as they call it in Redfield : a dusting .
CHEERS to paying attention .
A new USA Today / Gallup poll has bad news for senators who belong to the Republic party .
It seems that John and Jane Q. Citizen are paying close attention to their dithering :
The Senate 's failure to act last week rankled nearly two - thirds of those surveyed .

Democrats score early victory as election results roll in Democrats have won the closely contested governor 's race in Ohio and both parties are waiting to see which one will control Congress as more polls closed on Election Day 2006 .
Rep .
Ted Strickland defeated Republican Ken Blackwell with ease to become the first Ohio Democrat elected governor in 16 years .
Elsewhere , incumbents won several lightly contested Senate seats -- but most closely watched races are yet to be decided .
Up for grabs in today 's midterm elections are all 435 House seats , 33 Senate seats and governorships in 36 states as well as ballot initiatives in some states on such topics as gay marriage and stem - cell research .
ELECTIONLINE : Latest developments |
Your voting experience ?
Voter turnout could exceed the most recent midterm high of 42.1 % , according to Curtis Gans , director of American University 's Center for the Study of the American Electorate .
The non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics predicts campaign spending of $ 2.8 billion , up 27 % from 2002 .
At St. John 's United Methodist Church in St. Charles , Mo. , 35 people waiting outside at 6 a.m. to vote when polls opened .
Turnout was heavy through the day , said Denise Jensen , a poll worker who has worked the past past several elections at the precinct .
" It 's the highest I 've ever worked , " she said .
" If we continue at this pace , we 'll be at 80 % turnout . "
With voting beginning to wrap up , the key question is whether Democrats can tap into national unhappiness with President Bush and his conduct of the war in Iraq to pick up the 15 seats they need to control the House of Representatives and six seats they need to take the Senate .
Democrats were guardedly optimistic , particularly on the House races , but Republican leaders cited narrowing polls in Senate races in Montana , Rhode Island and Maryland as signs of an 11th - hour surge .
House races
At least two dozen Republican House seats are at risk .
Among GOP - held open seats , those in Arizona , Colorado , New York , Ohio and Iowa seemed most vulnerable .
Republican Reps. John Hostettler , Chris Chocola and Mike Sodrel of Indiana ; Charles Taylor of North Carolina ; Curt Weldon , Don Sherwood and Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania ; and Charles Bass of New Hampshire were in particularly difficult re-election struggles .
If Democrats should win the House , Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California , would be in line to become the first female House speaker in history .
All 435
House seats were on the ballot , and most incumbents were headed toward easy re-election .
The magic number was 218 seats for a majority .
The current lineup : 229 Republicans , 201 Democrats , one independent who lines up with the Democrats for organizational purposes , and four vacancies , three of them in seats formerly held by Republicans .
The fight for control came down to 50 or so seats , nearly half of them in a string stretching from Connecticut through New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana and Kentucky .
All were in Republican hands , a blend of seats coming open and incumbents in trouble .
Senate races
The battle for Senate seats in at least eight states remained close in final polls .
Races in Virginia , Tennessee , Pennsylvania and Missouri — all seats currently held by Republicans — were drawing particular interest .
In early returns , the Associated Press projected West Virginia 's Robert Byrd , a Democrat , was elected to a record ninth Senate term .
The AP also projected political independent Bernie Sanders won the Vermont seat now held by another independent , retiring Sen.
James Jeffords , guaranteeing that the next Senate will have at least one independent .
In Indiana , Republican Sen. Dick Lugar , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , coasted to a sixth term .
The Senate will have two independents if incumbent Joseph Lieberman wins in Connecticut .
Both Sanders and Lieberman are expected to vote Democratic when the chamber 's leaders are elected .
Voters filled 33 of the Senate 's 100 seats , and the GOP had some leeway .
Democrats needed a net pickup of six to recapture the majority that they last briefly exercised in 2001 - 2002 .
On the ballots were 17 seats now held by Democrats and 15 seats now filled by Republicans , including the Tennessee post of retiring Majority Leader Bill Frist .
Governors
With 10 new governors guaranteed to come out of Tuesday 's elections , state governments were in for their biggest shake - up in years — one that had a chance of being even more tumultuous if Democrats managed to reverse years of Republican dominance .
Ten states had open seats because of retirements , term limits and primary defeat .
Five other states were so competitive that incumbent governors were fighting hard to avoid being unseated .
In all , 36 states chose their top leaders .
The biggest names were in some of the least competitive races .
Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California was safely ahead in pre-election surveys , while Democrat Eliot Spitzer — an attorney general famous for pushing for Wall Street and corporate reform — was far ahead in New York , and polls showed Democrat Deval Patrick on track to become Massachusetts ' first black governor .
He would be only the second elected black governor ever nationwide .
GOP Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was a favorite to beat back a Democrat challenger and two independents , including musician and comic Kinky Friedman .
The Democrats were hoping to reverse the Republican majority among governorships that the GOP has held ever since the landslide of 1994 .
Exit polls
For voters in House races , national issues trumped local ones , according to national exit poll results released by the Associated Press .
About six in 10 voters disapproved of the war in Iraq , and they strongly favored Democratic House candidates .
Less than a third said the war has improved the long - term security of the United States , down from 46 % in the 2004 national exit poll .
While voters considered Iraq a very important factor in their decision , it lagged behind the economy , government corruption and scandal as a factor .
Terrorism was rated at least as important as Iraq .
More than twice as many voters said they felt angry toward President Bush as felt enthusiastic .
About four in 10 voters approved of how Bush is handling his job , slightly more than for Congress , .
Voting problems
As both parties revved up their massive get - out - the - vote operations , programming errors and inexperience dealing with electronic voting machines caused some problems : • A federal judge ordered an Ohio county to keep 16 Cleveland - area polling locations open until 9 p.m. ET because of long lines and earlier problems with voting machines .
There were reports some machines would n't function .
" We got five machines — one of them 's got to work , " said Willette Scullank , a troubleshooter from the Cuyahoga County , Ohio , elections board .
• In Indiana 's Marion County , about 175 of 914 precincts turned to paper because poll workers did n't know how to run the machines , said Marion County Clerk Doris Ann Sadler .
Election officials in Delaware County , planned to seek a court order to extend voting after an apparent computer error prevented voters from casting ballots in 75 precincts .
•
In Florida , voting was briefly delayed at four districts because of either mixed up ballots or electronic activators being unintentionally wiped out , according to Mary Cooney , spokeswoman for the Broward County Supervisor of Elections .
Voters were forced to use paper ballots after an electronic machine broke in the Jacksonville suburb of Orange Park . •
In suburban Pittsburgh , some precincts opened late because workers could n't zero out voting machines , raising concern that votes from previous elections had not been purged •
In Passaic County , N.J. , Republicans complained that a ballot had been pre-marked on some machines with a vote for the Democratic Senate candidate ; the state attorney general was looking into the matter .
Voting experts had feared widespread problems this year , as a third of Americans faced voting on on new equipment this year as well as coming to grips with new registration and voter ID rules .
" This is largely what I expected , " said Doug Chapin , director of Electionline.org , a non-partisan group that tracks voting changes and procedures .
" With as much change as we had , expecting things to go absolutely smoothly at the beginning of the day is too optimistic . "
In addition to voting glitches , the FBI is looking into election - related charges in two states .
In Michigan , the FBI is investigating the hacking of the website of Mike Bouchard , Republican candidate for the Senate .
FBI Special Agent Stephen Kodack Jr. also says the agency is also looking into reports of intimidating phone calls in Virginia , where people may have been steered to wrong polling places after being asked whom they supported .
Overall , the Justice Department said polling complaints were down slightly from 2004 by early afternoon .
Final pitches Bush pounded on the Democrats Monday night in a final rally in Dallas .
He lowered the rhetoric today after voting , with his wife , Laura , at a fire station near his ranch in Crawford , Tex .
" We live in a free society and our government is only as good as the willingness of our people to participate , " said Bush , wearing an " I voted " sticker on his jacket .
" Therefore no matter what your party affiliation or if you do n't have a party affiliation , do your duty , cast your ballot and let your voice be heard , " he said .
In Chappaqua , N.Y. , Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , took a nuanced approach when asked how she cast her ballot .
" I voted for change , except for me , " she said .
Bush used the last day of a 10 - state tour to stump for GOP gubernatorial candidates in Florida , Arkansas and Texas .
In Rochester , N.Y. , former president Bill Clinton campaigned for Democratic House candidates .
" We 've got to get all ours out , and then you 've got to hunt for people still standing on the diving board , " Clinton said .
" And when you find one , tell them what the choice is .
...
Grab them by the hand and tell them it 's time to jump off to a better future . "

Content management system Drupal turns six years old , and celebrates with the official launch of version 5.0 .
The Drupal community is strong , and the team reports that over 492 people have contributed to the fifth version of the popular open source system .
Among the news weâ€™ll find a web - based installer , a new core team , improved usability , user and module administration , improved performance and a bunch of news for developers , including the addition of the jQuery JavaScript library .
Thatâ€™s the latest craze by the way ; WordPress 2.1 will include the Prototype JavaScript library .
The 4.7 branch will continue to be supported , but 4.6 are officially out in the dark so if you run that youâ€™d better upgrade to 4.7 or 5.0 .
Thereâ€™s a series of videos in MP4 format to download if youâ€™re curious of Drupal .
The last version I fiddled with was nice enough , and Iâ€™m definitely looking at the system for some projects .
Their results agree for the most part with another study that was based on both penguin genes and anatomy , published this June in the journal Cladistics by Dr. Giannini and Sara Bertelli , also at the American Museum of Natural History .
" You see the same major patterns .
The picture is well established , I think , " Dr. Giannini said .
The Canadian researchers found that the penguin 's common ancestor existed 40 million years ago -- more than 30 million years after they think penguins evolved .
" There is a big gap there , " Dr. Pereira said .
He proposed that most of the older fossils of penguins ( some more than five feet tall ) belonged to extinct branches of the tree .
The study also finds that the living species that belong to the oldest branches of the penguin tree -- the gentoo , chinstrap and king penguins , along with the emperor penguins -- can all be found around Antarctica .
" The ancestor of the modern penguins were in Antarctica or very close , " Dr. Pereira said .
But the early penguins probably did not have to survive brutal conditions on Antarctica as they do today .
" Antarctica was covered in forest , much like we see in New Zealand today , " Dr. Pereira said .
The ice came later , about 35 million years ago .
Geologists suspect that the change occurred as a result of South America and Australia 's drifting away from Antarctica .
The ocean currents began to circle the continent , isolating it .
This cooling climate may have killed off the older penguins .
Some researchers have speculated that they disappeared because they could n't compete with whales hunting for the same prey .
Not all the penguins became extinct .
" Basically , what happened is penguins had to adapt to conditions in Antarctica , or they had to leave , " Dr. Pereira said .
The ancestors of the emperors and other residents of Antarctica evolved the ability to survive the conditions .
Other penguins swam north to milder waters , where they founded new lineages .
" Most of the species ended up leaving the continent , " Dr. Pereira said .
Penguins may have followed ocean currents carrying cool , nutrient - rich waters northward .
They established breeding grounds on new volcanic islands and branched off into new species .
But a number of security restrictions apply to those companies .
For instance , United States law requires that images of Israel shot by American - licensed commercial satellites be made available only at a relatively low resolution .
Also , the companies ' operating licenses allow the United States government to put any area off limits in the interests of national security .
A 24 - hour delay is mandated for images of especially high resolution .
Vipin Gupta , a security analyst at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , said the time delays were crucial , saying that in the national security sphere much can change between the time an image is taken and when it is used by the public .
" You can get imagery to determine whether there is a military base or airfield , but if you want to count aircraft , or determine whether there are troops there at a particular time , it is very difficult to do , " Mr. Gupta said .
" It 's not video . "
Andrew McLaughlin , a senior policy counsel at Google , said the company had entered discussions with several countries over the last few months , including Thailand , South Korea and , most recently , India .
India may be particularly sensitive to security issues because of its long - running border disputes with Pakistan , its rival nuclear power , and recurring episodes of terrorism .
Since 1967 , it has forbidden aerial photographs of bridges , ports , refineries and military establishments , and outside companies and agencies are required to have those images evaluated by the government .
High - resolution satellite photos face similar restrictions in India , which has its own sophisticated satellite imaging program .
Mr. Ramamurthy , the Indian science official , acknowledged that " there is very little we can do to a company based overseas and offering its service over the Internet . "
But General Rao , the Indian surveyor general , said the Indian government had sent a letter asking Google " to show sensitive sites , which we will list -- areas such as the presidential residence and defense installations -- in very low - resolution images . "
Mr. McLaughlin said he had not yet seen such a letter ; he said talks with India had centered specifically on images of the Kashmir border , long disputed by India and Pakistan .

The Verge 's Tom Warren spent the past week with an Xbox Series X , playing a variety of games on the preview unit , testing load times , performance , and some of the new Series X features .
Here 's an excerpt from each section of his report : " What I will say is that the Xbox Series X felt like I was playing on a familiar Xbox that 's a lot faster and more capable , " writes Warren in closing .
" The experience of switching back to an Xbox One was genuinely dispiriting .
" " The true next generation of games is still a mystery , but what I 've seen from backward - compatible games over the past week is encouraging .
I 'm hoping that game developers will have a lot fewer bottlenecks with both the Xbox Series X and PS5 , enabling them to deliver some game improvements we 're only used to seeing over on the PC side . "
Scientists from Johns Hopkins and from the University of Milan have effectively proven that they can inhibit lethal human brain cancers in mice using a protein that selectively induces positive changes in the activity of cells that behave like cancer stem cells .
The report is published this week in Nature .
The most common type of brain cancer - glioblastoma - is marked by the presence of these stem - cell - like brain cells , which , instead of triggering the replacement of damaged cells , form cancer tissue .
Stem cells , unlike all other cells in the body , are capable of forming almost any kind of cell when the right “ signals ” trigger their development .
For their treatment experiment , the researchers relied on a class of proteins , bone morphogenic proteins , that cause neural stem - cell - like clusters to lose their stem cell properties , which in turn stops their ability to divide .
First they pretreated human glioblastoma cells with bone morphogenic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) , then injected these treated cells into mouse brains .
In mice injected with cells that were not pretreated , large , invasive cancers grew .
In the mice with BMP4 - treated cells , no cancers grew at all .
Three to four months after injection , all mice that got untreated cells died , and nearly all mice with BMP4 - treated cells were alive .
Next , the scientists delivered slow - release BMP4 - containing “ beads ” directly into mouse brains with implanted glioblastoma cells .
Mice that got empty beads developed large malignant tumors and died .
Mice with BMP4 beads survived much longer , and 80 percent survived four months after cancer cell implants .
“ Our idea is to treat patients with BMP4 or something like it right after surgery to remove glioblastoma in hopes of preventing the regrowth of the cancer and improving survival time , ” says Alessandro Olivi , M.D. , director of the Division of Neurosurgical Oncology at Hopkins and a contributor to the study .
Olivi says clinical studies using BMP4 could begin within a year and , if successful , drug therapies could be available to the public within three to four years .
“ This was proof of the idea that BMPs could stop glioblastoma by depleting the stem - cell - like population that feeds it , ” says Henry Brem , M.D. , chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at Hopkins and a collaborator in the study .
“ This opens exciting doors to future research into treatments and therapies for such a devastating disease . ”

CHICAGO , Nov. 17 ( AP )  Scientists for the first time have grown human heart valves using stem cells from the fluid that cushions babies in the womb , offering an approach that may be used to repair defective hearts .
The idea is to create new valves in the laboratory while a pregnancy progresses and have them ready to implant in a baby with heart defects after it is born .
The Swiss experiment follows recent successes at growing bladders and blood vessels and suggests that people may one day be able to grow their own replacement heart parts , in some cases , even before they are born .
It is one of several tissue engineering advances that could lead to homegrown heart valves that are more durable and effective than artificial or cadaver valves .
South London Press , Oct. 7
Nature lovers fear that squirrels could become hooked on crack cocaine plundered from addicts ’ hidden stashes .
The furry animals are thought to be behind a new drugs turf war in Brixton — stealing rocks of crack hidden in front gardens .
Tough police action to rid the town centre of dealers and addicts has seen crackheads abandon their usual drug stash hideouts .
But the blitz has displaced some dealing into nearby residential streets .
Drug addicts are known to be hiding small stashes of crack rocks in people ’s front lawns late at night .
Squirrels have been spotted in the same front gardens , seemingly hunting out the buried narcotics .
The discovery has led some residents to speculate that the squirrels are already in the grips of addiction .
One resident , who asked for his name to be withheld , told the South London Press .
“ I was chatting with my neighbour who told me that crack users and dealers sometimes use my front garden to hide bits of their stash .
“ An hour earlier I ’d seen a squirrel wandering round the garden , digging in the flowerbeds .
“ It looked like it knew what it was looking for .
“ It was ill - looking and its eyes looked bloodshot but it kept on desperately digging .
“ It was almost as if it was trying to find hidden crack rocks . ”
Crack squirrels are a recognised phenomena in the US .
They are known to live in parks frequented by addicts in New York and Washington DC .
The squirrels have attacked park visitors in their frenzied search for their next fix .
An RSPCA spokesman said he was unaware of the squirrels taking crack in Brixton .
Now that finding needles in the web 's haystack has been made easier - thanks to Google and its search - engine peers - the next challenge is to find a better way of sifting through the mountains of news content available online .
The choice has been between using human editors such as Yahoo's news pages to do the filtering , or an automated aggregator such as Google News .
But neither is a satisfactory solution for providing easily updated , tailor - made news .
The better answer may be the approach taken by a news aggregator website named Reddit.com , the brainchild of two 22 - year - old graduates from the University of Virginia , Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian .
Reddit seeks to tap the " wisdom of crowds " means of gauging popularity - as exhibited by the social bookmarking site del.icio.us - by offering a front page of links to articles submitted by users , with individual users then able to vote for or against each article .
The voting has two important roles : first , items are promoted or demoted from the site 's front pages depending on how popular they are with readers ; second , by voting , users are training their individual filters , in the manner of Amazon 's book recommendations , to guess their preferences and serve up other news items that will interest them individually .
Users who post popular items build up " karma points " , which gives greater weight to their future postings , and vice versa : unpopular posters get slipped down the running order .
Reddit.com is certainly not the first to harness collaborative filtering : sites such as Kuro5hin and Slashdot pioneered user - driven content , with Digg.com a more sophisticated recent version .
But while those sites are primarily interested in technology news , Reddit is aimed at general readers .
The site 's clean lines and simple usability have drawn flattering comparisons with Google .
Since Google executives remain unhappy with Google News , it is no surprise to hear that people at Mountain View are looking closely at Reddit 's techniques .
The prize of becoming the web 's first " must - visit " site , the Google of news , is a huge one .
The site has only been running since mid-July , after Huffman and Ohanian were among the first group of start - ups supported by the innovative Y Combinator seed fund , set up by net guru Paul Graham and others .
The pair have received further funding , with the site now being visited by about 12,000 users each day .
Graham remains a big fan : " I never look at any news site now except Reddit ... Reddit 's like an RSS feed for the whole web , with a filter for quality . "

When standing at the rail of the observation deck of the Sears Tower⁠ — one of the tallest buildings in the world ⁠ — many visitors experience some degree of vertigo at the brink of the sheer , 1,353 foot drop - off .
This is a natural response as the body ’s self - defense system reminds its owner of the dangers of gravity .
If you ’re not fond of heights , a new construction project underway in Arizona will probably cause that self - defense mechanism to chew its way out of your body and flee for safety .
It ’s called the Grand Canyon Skyway , and it dabbles in altitudes which dwarf that of the Sears Tower .
The horseshoe - shaped walkway , scheduled to open later this year , will jut out seventy feet off the South Rim of the Grand Canyon , suspending its occupants about 4,000 feet above the ground ( about thrice the height of the Sears Tower ) as they stand on a glass floor , looking down .
The walkway ’s walls will be comprised of the same four - inch - thick glass as the floor , which will leave the spectacular view relatively unobstructed , even for those people who opt to remain on all fours .
The concept was born in the brain of David Jin in 1996 , and is now being overseen by the Hualapai Indians who have a reservation along the South Rim of the Grand Canyon .
Once complete , the Skyway will be reinforced by over a million pounds of 2.5 - inch - thick steel beams which should allow it to support seventy - two million pounds of weight , survive an 8.0 magnitude earthquake fifty miles away , and withstand winds in excess of 100 miles per hour .
Its design also calls for dampers to minimize the structure ’s vibration , which will allow the walkway to comfortably support up to one hundred and twenty people at once .
Upon opening , $ 25 will buy tourists a stroll ( or crawl ) on the Skyway which will provide a unique new perspective on the Grand Canyon .
Park officials are anticipating that this unique new feature will double the current number of visitors to the park .
Alongside the Skyway will be an Indian Village , a Western - themed town , and an underground restaurant with canyon views and rooftop dining .
At 4,000 feet above the Colorado River , the view of the Grand Canyon from the walkway promises to be nothing short of astonishing .
Consider that if one fell from such a height , one would have about twenty - five seconds ⁠ — about a half minute⁠ — to enjoy the Grand Canyon ’s incredible scenery before impact .
When the Skyway project began , its planners originally hoped that it would open by January 1 , 2006 .
Since then , it has been delayed by “ unique engineering challenges , ” as well as trouble finding an insurance company willing to insure the structure without getting twitchy .
Currently the opening date is slated for March 2007 .

( Editor 's note :
This statement arrived anonymously in our inbox recently and we felt it would be of interest to our readers . )
In the " D " , " D " does n't really stand for " Detroit " , but " Demolition . "
Take a look around and you 'll notice a great number of buildings marked on the front with a circled " D " in faint chalk .
Off to the side , many of these same buildings will also have a noticeable dot , courtesy of our own native son , Tyree Guyton .
These dotted buildings have stood for so long that they have become , arguably , the most memorable landmarks of our fair city .
In addition to Tyree Guyton , Detroit has had more than its fair share of artists who have taken notice of this situation and done something about it .
Recently , however , we have taken up a particular project that has actually netted results - faster than anyone , especially us , could have anticipated .
The artistic move is simple , cover the front in Tiggeriffic Orange - a color from the Mickey Mouse series , easily purchased from Home Depot .
Every board , every door , every window , is caked in Tiggeriffic Orange .
We paint the facades of abandoned houses whose most striking feature are their derelict appearance .
A simple drive would show you some of our most visible targets .
Just off I - 75 , around the Caniff / Holbrook exit , on the west side , towers a three story house , saturated so deeply in orange that it reflects color onto the highway with the morning sun .
Also , on the east side of the highway by the McNichols exit , is another house screaming orange .
In that same area , where the Davison Highway and John C Lodge M - 10 Highway intersect , sit a series of two houses painted orange , most visible from the Lodge side .
In our only location not visible from the highway , on the Warren detour between 94 and 96 on Hancock Street , sat a house so perfectly set in its color that it garnered approval from the Detroit Police Department .
Two of four locations have already been demolished .
Of the four , the building on Dequindre , by the Caniff / Holbrook exit , remains , as does the site that intersects the Lodge and Davison .
There was no " D " on any of the façades , only burnt boards , broken glass , and peeling paint .
Rallying around these elements of decay , we seek to accentuate something that has wrongfully become part of the everyday landscape .
So the destruction of two of these four houses raises a number of interesting points .
From one perspective , our actions have created a direct cause and effect relationship with the city .
As in , if we paint a house orange , the city will demolish it .
In this relationship , where do the city 's motivations lie ?
Do they want to stop drawing attention to these houses ?
Are the workers simply confused and think this is the city 's new mark for demolition ?
Or is this a genuine response to beautify the city ?
From another perspective , we have coincidently chosen buildings that were set to be demolished within the month .
However , with so many circled " D "s on buildings , it seems near impossible that chance would strike twice .
In any case , what will be the social ramifications of these actions ?
Each of these houses serves within the greater visual and social landscape of the city .
If the city does n't rebuild , will it be better to have nothing there rather than an abandoned house ?
In addition , each of these houses served as a shelter for the homeless at some point in time .
Now there are , at least , two less houses for them .
Why did n't the city simply choose to renovate ?
Everything affects not only our experience now , but also that of the next generation .
So before they are all gone , look for these houses .
Look at ALL the houses in Detroit .
If you stumble upon one of these houses colored with Tiggeriffic Orange , stop and really look .
In addition to being highlights within a context of depression , every detail is accentuated through the unification of color .
Broken windows become jagged lines .
Peeling paint becomes texture .
These are artworks in themselves .
If you see a house that you would like to see painted orange , paint it .
Afterwards , email the good people at thedetroiter.com at ws@thedetroiter.com .
These buildings are n't scenery .
Do n't look through or around them .
Take action .
Pick up a roller .
Pick up a brush .
Apply orange .
The dialogue is going .
Our goal is to make everyone look at not only these houses , but all the buildings rooted in decay and corrosion .
If we can get people to look for our orange while driving through the city , then they will at the same time , be looking at all the decaying buildings they come across .
This brings awareness .
And as we have already seen , awareness brings action .
Yours Truly ,
the DDD project

The M25 , central London , the Autobahn ... if you thought these roads were traffic - congested then take a look at this picture .
Hundreds of cars queue aimlessly for the chance to actually get to their destination in Xiamen , south China .
The country has experienced a massive increase this year in the sale of cars , according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers .
" Why are the liberals always on the other side ? " asks the fictional French military commander Colonel Mathieu when he is challenged , in The Battle for Algiers , for using torture to fight terror .
The film suggests that torture works as a tool of immediate necessity , even if the consequences are a blurring of morality and so final defeat .
Four decades on , Mathieu 's charge against liberal scruples is still being raised , implicit in the defence of the means being used in a modern battle against Islamic terror .
Old conventions and legal obligations are being portrayed as obstacles to victory in a conflict , it is said , whose scope and severity are being recklessly misunderstood .
Without supporting torture , the prime minister crystalised this thinking when he asserted last year that " the rules of the game have changed " .
John Reid 's urgent demeanour has done it again in the past week .
Counter - terrorism and justice do not always march in step and nor is the easy response , that justice must always come first , enough of an answer .
The dilemmas are more acute .
The arrest of 24 suspects in connection with an alleged plot to destroy airliners over the Atlantic may have been a triumph of intelligence and policing that saved many lives .
No government could be criticised for acting when it did , on the information it claims to have had .
Nor have legal safeguards been broken here .
Yet safeguards in other countries are less rigorous .
At what point do actions abroad pollute British justice , even if in the short - term they may protect British security ?
Reports from Pakistan suggest that much of the intelligence that led to the raids came from that country and that some of it may have been obtained in ways entirely unacceptable here .
In particular Rashid Rauf , a British citizen said to be a prime source of information leading to last week 's arrests , has been held without access to full consular or legal assistance .
Disturbing reports in Pakistani papers that he had " broken " under interrogation have been echoed by local human rights bodies .
The Guardian has quoted one , Asma Jehangir , of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , who has no doubt about the meaning of broken .
" I do n't deduce , I know - torture , " she said .
" There is simply no doubt about that , no doubt at all . "
If this is shown to be the case , the prospect of securing convictions in this country on his evidence will be complicated .
In 2004 the Court of Appeal ruled - feebly - that evidence obtained using torture would be admissable as long as Britain had not " procured or connived " at it .
The law lords rightly dismissed this in December last year , though they disagreed about whether the bar should be the simple " risk " or " probability " of torture .
But none of this stops governments acquiescing in torture to acquire information , rather than secure convictions , as British as well as American practice has shown .
It has been outsourced to less squeamish countries and denied through redefinition : but it is still torture and still illegal .
The former British ambassador to Uzbekistan has provided disturbing evidence of the uneasy boundary between benefiting from torture and encouraging it ; so did the Council of Europe 's report on rendition in June .
The defence , to the extent that anything other than evasion has been offered , is no better than the one provided by Colonel Mathieu in Algiers : it works .
But does it ?
Torture and other illegality can offer authorities a short - term seduction , perhaps even temporary successes .
Information provided by torture may have helped foil the alleged airliners plot .
But evidence provided uder torture is often unreliable , sometimes disastrously so - and its use always pollutes the broader credentials of torturers and their allies .
This battle must be won within the law .
Anything else is not just a form of defeat but will in the end fuel the flames of the terror it aims to overcome .
Abuses at Abu Ghraib were blamed on a few rogue US soldiers
Soldiers ' accounts show that detainees routinely faced severe beatings , sleep deprivation and other abuses for much of 2003 - 2005 , Human Rights Watch says .
Soldiers who tried to complain about the abuse were rebuffed or ignored .
But a Pentagon spokesman said 12 reviews had found there was no policy condoning or encouraging abuse .
" The standard of treatment is and always has been humane treatment of detainees in [ Department of Defence ] custody , " Lt Col Mark Ballesteros told Reuters news agency .
John Sifton , author of the Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) report , said the accounts given to the group by former US soldiers revealed the opposite .
" These accounts rebut US government claims that torture and abuse in Iraq was unauthorised and exceptional - on the contrary , it was condoned and commonly used , " he said .
Photos showing US soldiers abusing and sexually humiliating Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad in 2004 shocked the world .
Eleven US soldiers have now been convicted in connection with the abuse .
No senior officers have so far been convicted .
Stress positions
The HRW report gives first - hand accounts of abuses at a detention centre at Baghdad airport called Camp Nama , as well as a facility near Mosul airport and a base near al - Qaim on the Syrian border .
An interrogator posted at Mosul in 2004 told HRW that he and his fellow interrogators had been told by the officer in charge of their unit to use abuse techniques on some detainees .
ABU GHRAIB CONVICTIONS May 04 : Spc Jeremy Sivits - 1 year jail , bad conduct discharge Sept 04 : Spc Armin Cruz - 8 months jail , bad conduct discharge Oct 04 : Sgt Ivan Frederick - 8 years jail , dishonourable discharge Oct 04 : Spc Megan Ambuhl - fine , other than honourable discharge Jan 05 : Spc Charles Graner - 10 years jail , dishonourable discharge Feb 05 : Spc Roman Krol - 10 months jail , bad conduct discharge Feb 05 : Sgt Javal Davis - 6 months jail , bad conduct discharge Sept 05 : Pte Lynndie England - 3 years jail , dishonourable discharge May 05 : Spc Sabrina Harman - 180 days jail , bad conduct discharge Mar 06 : Sgt Michael Smith - 179 days jail , bad conduct discharge Jun 06 : Sgt Santos Cardona - 90 days labour , $ 7,200 fine
He described how they used dogs to intimidate the detainees , had them walking on their knees in the gravel and standing for extended periods with arms outstretched holding water bottles .
An interrogator at Camp Nama said the use of abuse techniques was commonplace - authorisation forms could be easily prepared for commanding officers to sign .
" I never saw a sheet that was n't signed , " the soldier said .
HRW gives accounts of instances where soldiers who were concerned by the abuses were thwarted from reporting it .
One military police guard at the facility near Qaim , who took his concerns to an officer , was reportedly told : " You need to go ahead and drop this , sergeant . "
Geneva Conventions
HRW says its findings show that criminal investigations of abuses need to follow the military chain of command , rather than focusing on lower - ranked soldiers .
The New York - based organisation calls on the US Congress to appoint an independent commission to investigate the extent of the problem , and urges US President George W Bush to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the abuse .
" It is now clear that leaders were responsible for abuses in Iraq , " Mr Sifton said .
" It 's time for them to be held accountable " .
The Bush administration has faced intense and sustained international criticism for its treatment of prisoners - in Iraq , Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
Earlier this month , the White House announced that all US military detainees would be treated in line with the minimum standards of the Geneva Conventions .
The shift in policy came almost two weeks after the US Supreme Court ruled that the conventions applied to detainees .
The Geneva Conventions , which were passed in the wake of World War II , are meant to guarantee minimum standards of protection for non-combatants and former combatants in war .

Microcredit : Why India is failing
Claire Cain Miller , Forbes | November 10 , 2006
I n the K R Puram slum in Bangalore , India , a group of 15 women gather in a small , muggy living room .
The electricity comes and goes , turning the fan and the single bare lightbulb on and off .
Flies buzz around the room , and children run in and out .
The women have borrowed $ 330 and meet weekly to make repayments .
The loans were meant to serve as capital for them to start small businesses and , eventually , lift themselves out of poverty .
But the women say the loans have n't turned into new income .
Sitting in a circle on the floor , some sound sad and others angry .
One woman has started selling firewood , but others have n't started businesses at all .
Instead , they say , the money helped them pay for urgent expenses , such as their children 's school fees .
It 's a scene that 's repeated inside dark living rooms and on parched rooftops across India .
Boosted by a government mandate to keep the startup funds flowing , lenders making these small , or microcredit , loans are dutifully throwing cash at shantytown borrowers .

And the funds -- $ 1.3 billion was lent during the year ended Mar 31 , up from $ 4 million in 1996 -- are often being used not as seed money for a new enterprise , such as buying a cow to sell the milk or setting up a fruit stand , but as handouts spent on consumption .
D S K Rao , the Asia organizer for the Microcredit Summit Campaign , estimates that only one - fifth of Indian microcredit borrowers start a business .
Mathew Titus , executive director of New Delhi - headquartered Sa -Dhan , an association of microcredit lenders , says it 's one - third , counting women who barter instead of selling goods .
Alas , there has never been a rigorous study in India or elsewhere of how successful the businesses become , whether any of the borrowers eventually graduate to the middle class or how many of the loans get repaid on time .
" I do n't know of any great studies -- they have n't been done , " says New York University professor Jonathan Morduch , who focuses on microcredit and economic development .
For much of its 35 - year history microcredit has enjoyed glowing reviews , culminating last month when Muhammad Yunus -- founder of Bangladesh 's microlending Grameen Bank - - won the Nobel Peace Prize .
The tiny loans appeal to both idealistic aid workers and gimlet - eyed bankers .
They seem to help the poor in developing countries earn a livelihood without making them dependent on handouts .
And they use market mechanisms , allowing banks to charge interest rates high enough to cover the risks of lending to people with no collateral and little credit history .
In India rates average 30 per cent a year , though some lenders charge more than 45 per cent .
In the last decade microcredit has taken off .
The 1997 Microcredit Summit in Washington , DC -- sponsors included the World Bank , MasterCard and JPMorgan -- vaulted microlending onto the world stage .
Participants pledged to lend to 100 million families worldwide within a decade .
Pushing to maintain the momentum , the United Nations named 2005 the International Year of Microcredit .
Today organisations from the US Agency for International Development to Citigroup trumpet the idea .

Emerging global cities
Much of that attention is focused on India , which is home to a quarter of the world 's poor but also one of the hottest economies .
The country has seen an explosion of microfinance institutions , which are usually set up by nongovernmental organizations .
Ten years ago 400 institutions boasted 200,000 customers .
Today there are 1,000 that , together with 300 commercial banks , lend to 17.5 million people , according to Sanjay Sinha , managing director of Micro - Credit Ratings International in India .
Much of the lending is based on Yunus ' original idea -- making loans to groups of women and relying on peer pressure from the members to ensure repayment .
" India was very small in this field ten years ago , " says Sam R Daley - Harris , director of the Microcredit Summit Campaign .
" Now they 're going like gangbusters , expanding ferociously . "
The money to fund all these lenders comes mostly from India 's biggest commercial banks , such as ICICI , State Bank of India and Canara Bank .
But some is put up by foreign investors and banks making social - responsibility bets , and by overseas donors .
Technology entrepreneurs are particularly intrigued .
The foundations of Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael and Susan Dell have each given $ 4 million or more to microcredit organisations .
Vinod Khosla , a Sun Microsystems founder and venture capital star , has put at least $ 1 million into Indian microfinance institutions , as donations and investments .
" In their anxiety to expand very fast , they are pushing loans , " says Rao , the microcredit campaign organiser .
" They 're not careful in vetting . "
At least , some groups of borrowers are first required to save money that they can put down as collateral ; others must outline their business ideas to lenders .
The rapid growth also means that lenders are less likely to keep tabs on a borrower after a loan is made .
In India , says Daley - Harris , borrowers sometimes " are on their own after a couple of years , whereas in Bangladesh there 's a bank worker who often visits every week for a lifetime . "
In Bangladesh there is one microfinance staffer for 131 borrowers and in Afghanistan one for 54 , but in India the ratio is one to 439 , according to the Microfinance Information Exchange in Washington .
The women in India could probably use more guidance , because it 's so difficult to run a business there :
The country ranks 134th out of 175 that the World Bank studied this year for ease of doing business .

The result is that lenders often hand over money without taking the time to educate the borrowers , making sure they understand that they 're supposed to start businesses and that there are penalties for not paying the money back , says Gowramma , secretary of the Bangalore branch of the All India Democratic Women 's Association , who works with women in the slums .
" The people receiving these loans do not know what this microcredit system is all about , " she says .
This means that microcredit's other goal -- to empower women in highly patriarchal societies - - is n't always achieved , either .
In Tumkur , a city outside Bangalore , a group of women received $ 155 loans .
They stood in a circle , placed their hands on the money and pledged to use their loans to launch businesses .
But afterward , each handed the money to her husband , and the men started the businesses .
Because the women are responsible for repaying the loan , they suffer the consequences if their husbands squander the money .
Microcredit advocates often claim impressively high repayment rates , averaging 95 per cent , as proof that borrowers do use their loans to generate income .
Otherwise they would n't be able to pay them back , they argue .
" Can [ microcredit ] be done badly ?
Absolutely , " Daley - Harris says .
" Can it make a massive difference in people 's lives when it 's done well ?
Absolutely . "
But in some cases women borrow from other sources to repay the loans .
That often means resorting to moneylenders -- or loans from friends and family -- to pay back the microloan and vice versa , trapping them in a cycle of debt .
The lucky ones have family members who have migrated to cities or abroad to work and send back remittances .
In Bangladesh , for example , 40 per cent of microcredit borrowers also borrow informally , says Thomas Dichter , who has evaluated microcredit programs in 20 countries , including India .
" You 're getting a large number of people borrowing from Peter to pay Paul , " says Dichter , who wrote the 2003 book Despite Good Intentions : Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed .
More important , Dichter and others who study microfinance doubt the repayment rates .
There are no reliable figures on the percentage of loans delinquent for more than , say , six months .
But it 's telling that the vast majority of the microlenders are not " sustainable , " meaning that so few loans are repaid on time and costs are so high that lenders need to keep tapping the easily available funds from banks , donors and the government to stay in business .
More than anything , the microcredit bubble is being inflated by government rules that all but force lenders to keep pumping out microloans .
New Delhi requires banks to devote 40 per cent of the money they lend to a category of borrowers that includes small enterprises , with about half of that going to rural outfits .
Banks have long struggled to meet this obligation , and lending to microcredit institutions that then lend to the groups of women offers an easy way to do it .
Sometimes microcredit does live up to its billing .
Manjula , a 40 - year - old seamstress who lives in Bagalur , a village 90 minutes away from downtown Bangalore , struggled to support her two children without help from her alcoholic husband .
She depended on moneylenders , who charge up to 1,000 per cent a year .
Two $ 220 microcredit loans over two years enabled her to open a shop selling saris , which she had been peddling from her home .
Since then she has increased her monthly income from $ 45 to $ 110 , including the earnings from side jobs tailoring and teaching sewing classes .
That 's enough to pay off her loan and save $ 30 a month .
" My dream is to convert this place into a big shop , " she says proudly .
It was success stories like this that drew Khosla , an affiliated partner in Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner , Perkins , Caufield & Byers , to microcredit in his native India .
Three microfinance lenders that he funds -- SKS Microfinance , Share Microfin and Activists for Social Alternatives -- are on a top - ten list compiled by Micro - Credit Ratings International , and he becomes so passionate about microcredit that his eyes tear up when he talks about it .
" This is the single most important tool for addressing poverty I have ever seen . "
Might a careful study turn that article of faith into a provable proposition ?
" I do n't need that study , " Khosla says .
" I wo n't spend a penny on it because I 've talked to 200 women who are recipients of these microloans myself .
I 've seen it in the field . "
Even Manjula 's success story needs some cautionary footnotes .
She started out with distinct advantages .
Unlike most of India 's poor , she is educated , speaks some English and started her business before receiving the loan .
And Manjula has n't been able to completely stop borrowing from moneylenders .
" The research is skimpy , but the research we do have shows increasingly that the main hope for microcredit -- that it will generate millions of tiny businesses and these businesses will grow and pull their owners over the poverty line -- is false , " says Dichter , the author .
By the Numbers
Microcredit is quickly spreading in India , but the loans do n't always lead to businesses ; in some cases they are even used to pay off previous debts .

I guess you 've heard that Microsoft's CEO , Steve Ballmer , has been quoted in a declaration filed in the Microsoft v. Google / Google v. Microsoft dueling lawsuits , as saying he will blankety blank kill Google and " bury " its CEO , Eric Schmidt .
Here 's the report , and excuse his language : Microsoft Corp. CEO Steve Ballmer vowed to " kill " internet search leader Google Inc. in an obscenity - laced tirade , and Google chased a prized Microsoft executive " like wolves , " according to documents filed in an increasingly bitter legal battle between the rivals .
The allegations , filed in a Washington state court , represent the latest salvos in a showdown triggered by Google 's July hiring of former Microsoft executive Kai Fu- Lee to oversee a research and development centre that Google plans to open in China .
. . .
Ballmer 's threat last November was recounted in a sworn declaration by a former Microsoft engineer , Mark Lucovsky , who said he met with Microsoft 's chief executive 10 months ago to discuss his decision to leave the company after six years .
After learning Lucovsky was leaving to take a job at Google , Ballmer picked up his chair and hurled it across his office , according to the declaration .
Ballmer then pejoratively berated Google CEO Eric Schmidt , Lucovsky recalled .
" I 'm going to f--- ing bury that guy , I have done it before , and I will do it again , " the declaration quotes Ballmer .
" I 'm going to f--- ing kill Google . "
I await with eager anticipation the cries of moral outrage from Rob Enderle and Laura Didio and Darl McBride and everyone else who has accused the FOSS community of verbal extremism .
That may be quite a wait , so let me be the first to call on the proprietary software community to condemn in no uncertain terms such violent speech coming from their community .
Death threats are never acceptable , do n't you agree ?
Such threats coming from the CEO of the largest software company in the world are far more serious than they would be coming from some teenage Slashdotter , because Ballmer surely has the means to follow through , does he not , should he actually mean it ?
If you were Mr. Schmidt , how safe would you be feeling today ?
It was a metaphor , you say .
Likely it was , but are you positive ?
And let 's say you answer yes , it was a metaphor .
Is it all right for a convicted monopolist to threaten to " kill " a competing company ?
Ballmer now denies he ever made such threats .
That is possible .
It 's also possible the Microsoft lawyers turned pale upon learning of the statement and insisted on a public denial .
He sort of has to deny it , since antitrust issues leap into our minds otherwise , and that is one of the things Google is complaining about in its litigation , not to mention that should Mr. Schmidt from this day forward have so much as a headache , the whole world will blame Mr. Ballmer .
Should he actually die , an investigation is certain to at least be considered , I would think .
If I were as rich as Mr. Schmidt , I 'd probably hire bodyguards , if we assume that Mr. McBride needed them on far less provocation .
All this made me decide to look into what would have Mr. Ballmer allegedly throwing a chair at the wall and making such threats .
For the record , and so that Mr. Ballmer does n't sue me or , gasp , decide to " bury " me , too , here 's what he says about it :
In a statement , Ballmer described Mark Lucovsky 's recollection as a " gross exaggeration .
Mark 's decision to leave was disappointing and I urged him strongly to change his mind .
But his characterization of that meeting is not accurate . "
It 's not true , the man says .
OK .
But it * feels * true , does n't it ?
At least it does to me .
So , appropriately inspired , I set out to find out what this was all about .
And here you go , everything I could find on the Google - Microsoft battle so far .
Note that there are some documents missing , because some state courts do n't make filings as fully available as District Courts , but this is what I 've learned and the significant documents that are available .
Unfortunately , the one document we most want to see , the one that tells about Ballmer allegedly throwing a chair across the room and threatening Google 's life and limb , is n't available yet .
I 'll explain the documents we do have , but remember that it 's just my impression , I do n't have all of them , and I 'm not giving it the fine - grained analysis I do in the SCO litigation , so feel free to read the documents themselves and draw your own conclusions .
This is more for fun .
Microsoft v. Google and Google v. Microsoft
First , there are two lawsuits filed .
Microsoft filed first in Washington State and a few days later , Google filed in California .
Google 's was then assigned to a US District judge .
It 's a dispute about Google hiring a Microsoft employee out from under them , Dr. Kai -Fu Lee , and it centers on a non-competition agreement which he signed in 2000 .
Microsoft filed first , so it has that advantage , and it got a temporary restraining order [ PDF ] until a hearing on September 6 on whether or not to extend it until the trial .
Frankly , getting to trial is likely to take longer than a year , which is all the non-compete clause covers , so we 'll see what the judge does , but it seems likely that the court will extend the restraining order .
As I will explain , that does n't mean Microsoft will win in the end , just that the judge wants to prevent unfixable damage .
But the first question is : which court will be the one that decides this dispute ?
The parties are fighting hard over that issue .
The Fight Over Jurisdiction
Where this gets heard is huge .
As it happens , California tends to toss non-compete 's overboard , so Google wants California to take the case long enough to do just that .
They have a motion for summary judgment [ PDF ] filed , asking that the agreement be declared invalid and unenforceable and against public policy in California .
Let 's pick up the narrative by looking at the various court filings .
Because I only have access to most of the Google v. Microsoft filings and only a few of the Microsoft v. Google filings , there could be gaps here or there , but a number of the Microsoft v. Google documents are filed in the Google v. Microsoft case as exhibits , including the Complaint , so we can get a pretty good picture .
Google and Dr. Kai-Fu Lee filed their action on July 21 .
It 's Case No. CV-05-03095 RMW .
Why not just file an answer to Microsoft 's complaint and bring counterclaims ?
To get it out of Washington and into California , silly .
It might not work , but it 's certainly worth a try .
Dr. Lee , in his Declaration [ PDF ] in support of their Motion for Summary Judgment , which has the non-competition agreement [ PDF ] attached as Exhibit A , tells us that it was he who approached Google , asking for a job , and they ultimately offered him one that he officially accepted on July 19 .
The Declaration says he told his Microsoft boss he quit on July 18 , and immediately thereafter , Microsoft served a complaint [ PDF ] on him , the one filed with the state 's Superior Court of the State of Washington .
The case is No. 05-2-23561-6 SEA , Microsoft Corporation v. Kai-Fu Lee and Google Inc. , for those of you wanting to track it down at the courthouse to get the rest of the filings .
Here are documents in the case that you can read without a Pacer account .
They do n't seem to make filings in general available on their website , however , just the rulings .
Microsoft has already begun filing sealed documents , which is n't a shock , because this is a case about secrets and because it 's Microsoft , and there 's an order [ PDF ] on how to handle such sealed documents already .
They have also demanded redactions from Google , notably a quotation from Bill Gates , something that Google said he said about Dr. Lee .
Going to the court is about the only way to get the rest of the court filings for that case , I think , unless I 'm just missing them somehow , which is always possible ( the declaration by Lucovsky was reportedly just filed on Friday , and so it would n't be available on Pacer yet anyway ) .
For that matter , the Google v. Microsoft complaint is n't available either , because it was filed in state court , and when the case was reassigned to US District Court , it was n't sent over .
They only have on Pacer what happened after that point .
I guess I should explain that in the US , states often call their lowest courts by high - sounding names like Superior Court or Supreme Court .
By that , they mean in contrast to things like city courts , like traffic court , not suggesting in any way that they are the ultimate court .
The US Supreme Court is the ultimate .
So here , the Superior Court is the first step , the trial court , in the chain of courts that might ultimately hear a case .
OK .
So Microsoft got the first bite .
Why were they in such a hurry ?
I am only guessing , but I believe it is likely because Google has its offices in California , and that is where Dr. Lee was headed .
California has a strong public policy of not allowing non-competition agreements to interfere with a man 's employment opportunities .
Washington State does not .
So , naturally , since Microsoft 's position is that the agreement blocks Dr. Lee from working for Google for a year on anything that is remotely the same as what he was doing for them , they 'd prefer to avoid California .
The Non-Compete Agreement In Microsoft 's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause [ PDF ] , they tell us their reasons for concern : Dr. Kai-Fu Lee -- with Google 's encouragement -- is blatantly violating his non-competition promises to Microsoft .
He is doing so by defecting Microsoft for Google , a direct competitor in markets as to which Dr. Lee holds Microsoft 's most sensitive technical and strategic information .
The non-compete provisions Microsoft seeks to enforce are narrowly drawn and were agreed to by Dr. Lee as a condition of his return to Redmond as a Microsoft Vice President , a position for which he was paid over a million dollars last year alone .
For the past five years , Dr. Lee has held leadership positions with respect to Microsoft 's efforts to develop new and improved search engine technologies .
Microsoft is engaged in intense competition with Google in the market for these products .
By virtue of his leadership roles , Dr. Lee learned Microsoft 's most sensitive technical and strategic business secrets about search technologies .
Throughout this time he was also deeply involved in Microsoft 's efforts to expand its business in China and learned Microsoft 's confidential strategic plans regarding that crucial new market .
Dr. Lee decided to defect Microsoft for Google in order to lead Google 's new China operation developing search technology .
This places him in direct competition with Microsoft on two issues -- search engines and China strategy -- where Dr. Lee holds Microsoft 's most proprietary , confidential , and competitively sensitive information .
This is a clear violation of the non-compete provisions of Dr. Lee 's Employment Agreement .
Microsoft is therefore compelled to seek a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent the actual and substantial injury that will result if Dr. Lee is allowed to violate his non-competition promises .
They call it narrowly drawn for a reason .
No court in the world will say a man can't work at all in his chosen field ever again .
It 's obvious that at a certain level , you really could n't work anywhere ever again , if an agreement were allowed to be written broadly enough .
So Microsoft here is stressing that they are n't asking for more than the law allows .
The standard in Washington , according to Microsoft , is this : [ A ] noncompete agreement will be enforced so long as it is reasonably necessary to protect the employer 's business , does not impose on the employee any greater restraint than is reasonably necessary for that protection , and is not contrary to the public interest .
Dr. Lee has limited options , given his area of speciality and how few search engine companies there are , so the court has to weigh his interest in staying employed against his former employer 's interest in keeping their secrets secret from a competitor .
The agreement had confidentiality clauses also , they tell us .
That is significant , because there is no time limit on them .
He agreed , they claim , to * never * reveal confidential matters or * ever* to solicit Microsoft employees to leave the company for a job elsewhere .
The non-compete clause is considerably easier to justify .
Clause 9 reads like this : 9 . Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation .
While employed at Microsoft and for a period of one year thereafter , I will not ( a ) accept employment or engage in activities competitive with products , services or projects ( including actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development ) on which I worked or about which I learned confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets while employed at Microsoft ; ( b ) render services to any client or customer of Microsoft for which I performed services during the twelve months prior to leaving Microsoft 's employ ; ( c ) induce , attempt to induce , or assist another to induce or attempt to induce any person to terminate his employment with Microsoft or to work for me of for any other person or entity .
If during or after my employment with Microsoft I seek work elsewhere , I will provide a copy of this Agreement to any persons or entities by whom I am seeking to be hired before accepting employment with or engagement by them .
Personally , I 'd just stick to an agreement if I 'd signed it , but that 's just me .
I 'd stick to an agreement if I simply * said * I would , let alone signing anything .
[ UPDATE : I have gotten two more documents from the Microsoft v. Google litigation , and they definitely clarify the situation considerably : Microsoft 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ PDF ]
Public Version of Google Inc.'s Opposition to Microsoft's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ With Redactions Demanded by Microsoft ] [ PDF ]
It turns out that Dr. Kai-Fu Lee and Google unilaterally stipulated that pending trial Dr. Lee will not work on any technical areas listed by Microsoft in its proposed preliminary injunction , but that was n't enough for Microsoft to drop its motion .
According to Google , Microsoft is claiming that they have confidential methods of hiring people and Dr. Lee should n't be allowed to do that either , ever .
Here 's a segment from Google 's opposition to Microsoft 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction , and you 'll note the redaction at the very beginning , apparently demanded by Microsoft :
To address Microsoft 's purported concerns about Dr. Lee 's knowledge of " confidential " Microsoft information , Defendants have stipulated that , pending trial to determine what technical or strategic information Dr. Lee actually worked on or knew , and whether it could be put to competitive use for Google , Dr. Lee will not work or consult in any of the technical areas identified in Microsoft 's proposed preliminary injunction .
Rather , pending trial , he will open a product development center in China , and staff it with non-Microsoft personnel .
But Microsoft wants far more .
It interprets its standard non-compete agreement to ban Dr. Lee from doing any work for Google -- or for any other software company -- in China , or anywhere else , that falls within the range of all of Microsoft 's business globally .
Microsoft brought this preliminary injunction motion not out of concern for any confidential information , which Google and Lee have stipulated to protect , but out of a desire to delay Google 's entry into China , and make an example of Dr. Lee for other Microsoft employees who might have the audacity to " defect " from Microsoft .
See Microsoft TRO Mtn. at 1 . Microsoft has no legal right , contractual or otherwise , to prevent Dr. Lee from utilizing his charismatic , personal qualities and general skills to start up a facility and hire from China 's universities , and from companies other than Microsoft .
Microsoft 's claim that its non-compete covers recruiting is contrary to the terms of the non-compete covenant itself , which applies only to " products , services and projects , " such as research , for which Dr. Lee was responsible , and not to the general activities Dr. Lee engaged in as a vice president , such as interviewing prospective executive hires .
. . .
Microsoft has not identified any confidential recruiting information or relations , and Dr. Lee knows of none , that could be put to competitive use for Google .
Every aspect of what Microsoft has alleged is its " confidential " recruiting information and relations -- has been publicly disclosed on Microsoft 's website and in public presentations by its management , besides being generally known .
II .
STATEMENT OF FACTS A. Google hired Dr. Lee to start and staff its product development center in China because of his reputation in China , and with Chinese students , not to obtain Microsoft information Google hired Dr. Lee to help it start up a China development center because of his stature in China , his integrity , his leadership and managerial skills , his technical credentials , and his commitment to and connection with Chinese students .
Every Google executive deposed in this case has so testified .
. . .
Google did not hire Dr. Lee to obtain Microsoft information .
Google is admittedly ahead of Microsoft in search technology .
. . .
B. Dr. Lee 's unique personal skills belong to him -- not Microsoft .
The unique skills and qualities that make Dr. Lee an ideal recruiter for Google are personal to him -- Microsoft does not own them and cannot prevent Dr. Lee from using them on behalf of Google .
As you can see , there have already been depositions .
This litigation is moving a lot faster than SCO v. IBM , would n't you say ?
It shows what can be done when your object is actually resolution of the issues and not just delay .
This makes it clearer that Google is n't even asking to get out of the noncompete agreement , only to clarify at trial exactly what is covered by it .
Personally , I 'm very relieved to see that .
This also impacts on my analysis , so keep that in mind as you read on .
I gave Microsoft too much of the benefit of every doubt , I realize , on reading the newly acquired filings .
[ End Update . ]
But there is a line that the law recognizes .
If there is , in any contract , parties that are not evenly matched , shall we say , then the law scrutinizes such an agreement more carefully , and the weaker party may not be bound by what can be viewed as overreaching terms .
You see the issue come up regularly in pre-nuptial agreements , if the man has more education and money than the wife , particularly if she had no attorney of her own .
To give a more extreme example , if a mobster holds a gun to your head and tells you to sign over your business to him or else something might happen to you , the courts are n't going to hold you to your " word " .
They will figure the " bargain " was n't fairly entered into because you were n't in a position to negotiate equitable terms , and they wo n't uphold the deal .
Precisely where that line is between a hard bargain between equals and an unconscionable agreement varies from state to state , case to case .
But Microsoft makes a reasonable point when it points out that it relied upon Dr. Lee 's promises and that it never would have hired him or given him access to confidential information at such a high level without those promises .
In any contract , if one side relied on the promises of the other side , it reinforces the validity of the contract , so that is why they are saying that .
It 's also probably true that without the agreement , they would have kept him from confidential materials , but at a certain point , you can't do your job unless they reveal what you need to function , so it 's true only to a point .
Microsoft says he sat in on high level meetings regarding plans for China up until May of 2005 .
Dr. Lee , they tell the court , managed technical teams working on MSN Search technology .
At one point he was " even in charge of Microsoft 's overall business efforts for MSN Search . "
The tech he managed includes improvements in " natural language processing " and speech research to improve the ability to search for audio and video files , and " highly confidential new and innovative search technologies using machine learning concepts . "
He therefore knows the " software architecture , source code , and algorithmic structure for the current MSN search engine " as well as Windows Desktop Search , and he is familiar with Microsoft 's strategies for the future to " market and monetize " search products , according to Microsoft .
You can almost hear them throwing up at the very thought of Dr. Lee defecting to Google with all that inside his head .
( Dear Dr. Lee : Please do n't ever donate anything to Linux , okay ?
We have enough trouble . )
An interesting detail is that Microsoft says it has a Google competition " playbook " .
It 's funny to me how all these corporations think in sports terms .
It must be a guy thing .
Dr. Lee went to a meeting at which top executives were briefed on " The Google Challenge " in March .
So he knows precisely how Microsoft plans to compete against Google in the search engine marketplace , Microsoft complains .
Both the product line and the geographical market " directly overlap . "
You can understand this from their standpoint if you think of a worst - case scenario : your competitor secretly sends someone over to you to seek employment .
He does n't say he is from your competition .
You hire him and teach him a bucket of stuff , and then he quits and goes back to your competitor with all your information .
In the cutthroat business world , which is more like war than sports , except for the actual killing part ( one hopes ) , no doubt someone would try it or has , and that is what non-competition agreements are supposed to prevent .
Here , though , Microsoft has one problem .
This agreement is worldwide .
Usually they are geographically limited , and Microsoft here realizes this could be a problem , so it says that a non -compete can be as broad in scope as the business you 're in .
Microsoft 's business is worldwide .
But that is the same as saying that Dr. Lee can't work for anyone anywhere for a year .
Well .
He can sling hash , I suppose .
Microsoft says he can work for any competitor as long as he takes a position that is n't directly competitive .
But what would that be at Google ?
I did hear they are looking for a chef , but that is n't Dr. Lee 's field of expertise .
With his training and experience , what really can he do for Google that would n't compete with some aspect of Microsoft 's business interests ?
Microsoft also argues that there is no public impact on Dr. Lee cooling his heels for a year , but I can think of a public interest , although I doubt the court will view it as anything to shake a stick at : we have an interest in search engines that work well , so innovation in that field is to our benefit .
If Dr. Lee were to die , for example , before he gets to build his vision of what a search engine can do , we will be the losers .
Well , he was n't personally threatened with burial , so I guess that is remote .
But personally , if Microsoft did " kill " Google , the whole world would be bereft .
Dr. Lee 's Side of the Story Dr. Lee , in his Declaration , tells us that he moved to California on the 19th , then registered to vote in California , got telephones in his name there , including a new cell phone , got a new driver 's license in California , giving up the one he had in Washington State , and is now paying payroll taxes and income taxes to California .
No doubt Google expected Microsoft might sue , and we can assume that because Dr. Lee negotiated , as part of his package , that Google would pay his legal bills , should such a lawsuit ensue .
Microsoft in its Motion for a temporary restraining order points out that Dr. Lee still has a residence in Washington State .
I 'm guessing that is just because he has n't found a buyer yet .
All of this is to prove to the court that Dr. Lee is a California resident now , with plans to stay there for the foreseeable future , so that the court will be inclined to accept the case and rule in his favor on the non-compete issue .
And that is what their Motion for Summary Judgment is about .
They ask the court to rule as a matter of law that the agreement is against public policy , is invalid and unenforceable and should n't be upheld .
They also say in their complaint that Microsoft 's efforts to enforce the agreement violates California law and is an unlawful business practice , illegal restraint of trade .
Why Microsoft is suing Google too is a puzzlement to me .
Maybe they did it because when you are working very fast , and their lawyers were , you throw in anything you think you might need , so you are covered .
But as Google points out in their response [ PDF ] to Microsoft 's Notice of Pendency , they are being sued essentially for offering a man a job , which is not an illegal activity .
They are not parties to the agreement in question .
Lee 's supervisor was Eric Rudder , we learn from Microsoft 's Answer and Affirmative Defenses [ PDF ] , filed in answer to Google 's California Complaint , and we learn that Dr. Lee submitted his resignation by letter .
Microsoft 's Motion for the TRO fills in a detail .
It seems Dr. Lee told his boss on July 5 that he was considering going to Google .
Rudder talked him out of it , urging him to wait and " explore opportunities for a Microsoft position in China . "
That explains how the lawyers were able to work so fast and serve Dr. Lee immediately after his meeting with Rudder on the 19th , when he handed in his letter of resignation .
They were ready for him , just in case , apparently .
Several Microsoft executives met with Dr. Lee to try to get him to change his mind .
But Microsoft says Google offered Dr. Lee the opportunity to " build and lead its China office 'end to end . ' "
I 've heard that is how Google gets folks on board -- they offer you the opportunity to make your vision , whatever it is , come true .
You have to admit , that is irresistible to anyone with a vision .
I 'm further guessing that Microsoft has templates from earlier defections on hand to work from .
If I were Microsoft , with all the money in the world , and lawyers to burn , metaphorically speaking , I 'd ask them to prepare and keep up - to - date every possible type of complaint , just in case .
Their claim in the Washington lawsuit is that in addition to Dr. Lee being in violation of the agreement , the " conduct of Google and Dr. Lee constitutes threatened misappropriation of trade secrets " and that Google 's conduct " constitutes or threatens tortious interference with contractual relations . "
Constitutes or * theatens *?
Well .
OK .
Call that a placeholder .
They want to do discovery , I guess , and naming Google too makes that amply possible .
No doubt they want to know exactly how much has been revealed to Google already , they want to prevent any further leaks , and they want it to cost Google an arm and a leg , metaphorically speaking , part of the I 'll - blankety - blank - kill - you threat 's fulfillment , perhaps .
Microsoft 's Temporary Restraining Order Microsoft was easily able to get a temporary restraining order [ PDF ] from the state court .
I say it was easy , because the nature of the claim makes it very hard for any court to deny such a request .
The bar will be higher , though , when it comes to getting a restraining order lasting until trial .
But with so much at stake , I frankly can't see how a court will say no .
The reason is that if they do n't restrain him , the damage will be done and irreversible .
Microsoft will be left without a remedy , even if it wins the case .
By the time it goes to trial , the non-compete clause is likely to have run out , so without a restraining order , they could win at trial , but have it be too late to do them any good .
Mere money wo n't make them whole , even if there existed a way to quantify their loss accurately .
Dr. Lee would have benefitted from the bargain , they point out , getting the Microsoft job and the salary , but then he flies off without keeping his side of the bargain , so Microsoft gets no benefit at all from the agreement .
If they do restrain him until trial , and Google and Dr. Lee prevail , the damage to Dr. Lee is minimal , by comparison .
Microsoft had to post a million - dollar security to pay costs and damages in the event that the defendants are found to have been wrongfully enjoined , but you can't put secrets back into secrecy , once they are let free .
The damage to Google is real , but they did know about the agreement going in , and they were willing to hire him anyway .
If I were the judge , that 's how I 'd see it , anyhow .
But a decision like that is n't an indication of which side the judge thinks has the strongest case .
He 's balancing the equities , trying to figure out how to keep both sides reasonably whole no matter which way it ultimately goes , since there really is no way to know who is right this early in the game .
So , now you know what it means when you hear about forum shopping .
That is step number one in major litigation , and no good lawyer would not think about it .
Where you file matters .
This case shows why .
An non-competition clause is the heart of the case .
Dr. Lee did sign the document , and now he would like to say clarification of exactly what it covers .
He has other arguments too ; for example , it is his position that what he will be doing for Google is n't the same as what he did for Microsoft , so the agreement does n't apply in the situation , and that he can't do anything like the work he did for Microsoft for over a year anyway , since Google has no center built in China yet , but the quickest and easiest solution , from his standpoint , is to get the agreement tossed out , so he can get to work immediately , without worrying about all this .
He was hired , he tells us , to help Google open and establish a new research and development center in China .
" The exact business plans and focus of this new project research and development center have yet to be fully determined , " he says , " It is intended , however , that the new center will develop products to be used throughout the numerous markets that Google serves .
I was expected to oversee recruiting and facilities construction in China for the new research and development center beginning in late 2005 . "
Then , he adds , he 'll be moving to China for a couple of years on a temporary basis , but retaining his California residence and continuing to pay taxes there .
This is to say , in legalese , as I understand it , that the agreement not to compete can't be said to apply to what he 'll be doing , because no one even knows yet precisely what he will be doing so making a claim that it is the same as what he promised not to do has to fail , and he can't start doing it until the center is built and running , and that is sure to take a year anyway , and since the non-compete clause is only for a year , this is all a fuss about nothing .
That is his argument , but I 'm sure Microsoft will view that with a cynical eye and point out that he is n't being hired for his human resources or building construction skills .
His resume tells you what he will likely be doing , and he knows too much about Microsoft 's secrets ; they accuse him of already sending confidential documents to Google , which Google denies .
You can read Google 's specific explanation of what Dr. Lee sent in their Public Version of Google Inc. 's Opposition to Microsoft 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction .
It was all public information , they say .
The TRO says he can't hire away any of Microsoft 's employees either , so that seems to be a real concern of Microsoft's .
Google 's announcement of his joining the company said that he will serve as President of the company 's Chinese operations and that the new center will strengthen Google 's search efforts , as well as focusing on " developing new innovative technologies and projects , " Microsoft points out , and they flat out say that he was hired to work on search and to do so immediately .
That is in direct competition with Microsoft , hence covered by the agreement .
He was , they tell us , " one of the main architects of Microsoft 's business strategies in China . "
No doubt that worries them plenty too .
And that is an area that is bound to get serious , because of some eternal confidentiality clauses in the agreement .
In their Answer , Microsoft denies that their " limited non-competition provision " violates California public policy or is invalid or unenforceable under California law , and Microsoft does n't think the agreement is governed by California law anyway .
It says troubles will be aired out in Washington .
They also do n't think they are guilty of illegal restraint of trade , which Google has alleged .
Dr. Lee was the initial employee of Microsoft Research Asia in China in 1998 .
It was n't until he went to work in Redmond , Washington in 2000 that he signed the agreement .
This could end up mattering , depending on what he will be doing for Google in China and what he did for Microsoft since 2000 .
If what Dr. Lee will be doing for Google is similar to what he did for Microsoft in China but not what he did later in Redmond , Microsoft could be up a creek without a paddle .
That is the kind of detail that lawyers need and depend on the client to provide , so if you are ever in litigation , be sure to tell your lawyer everything you can think of .
Your lawyer will know which detail , like this one , might matter under the law .
You might not , so just tell everything , and when you see your attorney 's eyes light up , you 'll know it matters .
From Microsoft 's Answer , we also learn that Dr. Lee was on sabbatical from Microsoft as of June of 2005 .
We learned already that he approached Google in May , and quit in July , so the timing seems , well , pointedly helpful , should a person want to house hunt , let 's say , or register to vote in a new state .
Microsoft , in a footnote , say that Microsoft 's sabbatical policy is that you can't use it to job hunt and then not return .
Dr. Lee " confirmed " the policy in writing and orally , they say .
Sheesh .
Maybe Microsoft should look to its policies .
That kind of regimentation must make some yearn to escape the bird cage , I would think .
And , as we see , people act like people anyway , so what 's the point ?
UPDATE : In Google 's Public Version of Google Inc.'s Opposition to Microsoft 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction , they answer this allegation : Microsoft has accused Dr. Lee of breaching a formal , written policy , allegedly set forth in a document he signed , requiring him to return after his sabbatical term ended .
Senior Microsoft VP
Eric Rudder , who declared to those facts under oath , has now admitted , also under oath , that no such written policy is set forth in the documents signed by Lee.
Rudder was Dr. Lee 's boss , remember .
Are we starting to get a feel for why Dr. Lee was unhappy working for Microsoft ?
[ End update ]
The agreement , Microsoft points out , provides that it be governed by the laws of the State of Washington and that exclusive venue for any action lies in state or federal court located in King County , Washington .
Personally , I would n't want to sign any agreement with Microsoft with such a provision .
I think we can assume a home court advantage in a state that likely rakes in mucho dinero in taxes and political contributions from Microsoft .
Then there is the golf course schmooze factor .
California has no stake here , Microsoft argues , on one additional ground : the agreement was entered into in Washington State between two Washington residents .
( Here they are using the corporate entity as a " person " residing in that state . )
Dr. Lee agreed to the terms of the agreement , and it should stand .
Google and Dr. Lee 's request for declaratory relief should at least be stayed or the California court should abstain from hearing the case at all , Microsoft asserts , " in favor of the first - filed , ongoing , and more advanced Washington State court action . "
" More advanced " is a bit of a stretch , when you consider that the two complaints were filed within days of each other in mid-July and their Answer is dated August 11 , but a lawyer 's job is to advance every possible argument .
Microsoft really does n't want this heard in California , and you can't blame them .
I would n't either .
But their argument is that they got a temporary restraining order already in Washington State , so Google and Dr. Lee can't ask for summary judgment in California , that they are barred by collateral estoppel and / or res judicata .
That is a bit of a stretch too , but hey .
Microsoft requests that the California complaint be dismissed and that they get their legal fees regarding the matter paid , as per the agreement , which has a clause that loser pays .
The Confidentiality Promises
By my reading , the non-compete issue is the least of Dr. Lee 's worries .
That only lasts one year .
It 's the rest , the confidentiality promises , that last for the rest of his life .
It reads in part like this : During my employment and at all times thereafter , I will not disclose to anyone outside MICROSOFT nor use for my purpose other than my work for MICROSOFT : a ) any MICROSOFT confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets ; or b ) any information MICROSOFT has received from others that it is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary .
There 's more , but that is enough to give you the flavor .
But think about this man 's skills and experience .
They are suing him in advance of any known violation .
Where can he work now , for the rest of his life ?
Doing what ?
Whether a court , even in Washington , will uphold such a timeframe in a field as narrow as this seems doubtful to me , and I have to wonder at Microsoft 's nerve in even asking an employee to sign such a document .
On the other hand , nerve has never been in short supply in Redmond .
So you can get the taste of the litigation , without having to lift a finger even to click on a PDF , here is Google 's and Dr. Lee's RESPONSE TO MICROSOFT CORPORATION'S NOTICE OF PENDENCY OF OTHER ACTION , as text .

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
SAN JOSE DIVISION GOOGLE INC .
and KAI - FU LEE , Plaintiffs , v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION , Defendant .
__________________________
Case No. : C 05-03095 ( RMW )
GOOGLE INC .'S AND KAI-FU
LEE'S RESPONSE TO MICROSOFT
CORPORATION'S NOTICE OF
PENDENCY OF OTHER ACTION
( PURSUANT TO CIVIL L.R. 3 - 13 ) Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-13 ( c ) , plaintiffs Google Inc. ( " Google " ) and Kai - Fu Lee ( " Dr. Lee " ) responds as follows to defendant Microsoft Corporation 's ( " Microsoft " ) Notice of Pendency of Other Action .
I. RELATIONSHIP OF THE ACTIONS
In the case pending before this Court , Google and its employee , Dr. Lee , seek a declaration that the covenant not to compete contained in Dr. Lee 's employee agreement with his former employer , Microsoft , is an unlawful restraint of trade , and thus is invalid and unenforceable pursuant to well - established California law and public policy .
Google and Dr. Lee filed their complaint in this action in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara on July 21 , 2005 .
Microsoft thereafter removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction on July 29 , 2005 , acknowledging that Dr. Lee is a California citizen .
From August 2000 through mid-July 2005 , Dr. Lee , a computer scientist , worked for Microsoft in the State of Washington .
Prior to that time , Dr. Lee had been employed by two California companies , and from late 1998 until approximately August 2000 , by an affiliate of Microsoft in China .
Dr. Lee signed the Microsoft employment contract at issue in this lawsuit upon his return to Washington from China in August 2000 .
The covenant not to compete contained in that agreement provides , in pertinent part , as follows :
While employed at Microsoft and for a period of one year thereafter , I will not : ( a ) accept employment or engage in activities competitive with products , services or projects ( including actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development ) on which I worked or about which I learned confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets while employed at Microsoft . . . .
See Microsoft 's Notice of Pendency of Action , Exh . A , at p. 5:1 - 4 .
On or about July 5 , 2005 , while on sabbatical , Dr. Lee informed Microsoft he intended to resign his position at Microsoft and was considering employment with California - based Google .
On his last day of employment with Microsoft , July 18 , 2005 , Microsoft served Dr. Lee with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County .
That action is entitled Microsoft Corporation v. Kai-Fu Lee and Google Inc. , Civil Case No. 05-23561-6 .
The complaint in 1 . the Washington action alleges that Dr. Lee violated the terms of his employment agreement with Microsoft by accepting employment with Google , that Dr. Lee 's conduct " threatens to disclose " or Dr. Lee " inevitably will disclose " Microsoft 's trade secrets to Google , and that Google tortiously interfered with Microsoft 's contract with Dr. Lee by offering him a job .
See Microsoft 's Notice of Pendency of Other Action , Exh . A , at pp. 8:13 - 10:7 .
On July 19 , 2005 , Dr. Lee moved to California to begin his employment at Google .
He is a citizen of the United States and is currently living in California .
While he is expected to spend time in China as part of his job responsibilities for Google , traveling to and from California during the course of his overseas assignment , Dr. Lee will at the same time report to and remain in ongoing contact with senior management and other employees with whom he will be working at Google 's headquarters in Mountain View , California .
Dr. Lee intends to maintain permanent residency in California while he is on overseas assignment in China .
Dr. Lee 's employment agreement with Google provides that he is not to disclose any confidential or trade secret information of his former employer to Google .
II .
FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
Microsoft contends that the Court should dismiss this action or stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the Washington state court action .
The Washington action is currently scheduled for trial on January 9 , 2006 , with a preliminary injunction hearing set for September 6 , 2005 .
The Washington state court entered a Temporary Restraining Order against Google and Dr. Lee on July 28 , 2005 . . . .
According to Microsoft , this Court should defer to the Washington state court to " avoid conflicting judgments . "
Contrary to Microsoft 's request , the California Supreme Court has held in similar circumstances that parallel proceedings in different courts should go forward .
See Medtronic , Inc. v. Advanced Bionics Corp. , 29 Cal. 4th 697 ( 2002 ) .
In Medtronic , the Supreme Court reversed an antisuit injunction that prohibited the parties from litigating the enforceabilty of the same non-compete provision in Minnesota , while a parallel California action was allowed to proceed .
Although the Supreme Court did not prohibit the litigants from continuing Minnesota case , the Court found that the pendency of the Minnesota action did not divest California of jurisdiction .
See id. at 708 .
2 . This California - based action similarly must be allowed to proceed independently to promote fundamental public policy in California .
Since 1872 , with the enactment of the predecessor statute to Business and Professions Code section 16600 ( " Section 16600 " ) , California has had a well - established public policy of ensuring free movement of employees unencumbered by post - employment restrictions .
Section 16600 provides , in pertinent part , that " every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession , trade , or business of any kind is to that extent void . "
California 's public policy in favor of competition and " freedom of movement of persons whom California - based employers . . . wish to employ , " and against contracts in restraint of trade , is deeply rooted .
See Application Group , Inc. v. Hunter Group , Inc. , 61 Cal. App. 4th 881 , 900-01 ( 1998 ) .
California 's policy is intended to ensure that its employers remain competitive , and has been held by California courts to outweigh the interest that out - of - state employers may have in enforcing anti-competitive covenants -- even covenants allowed under the laws of other states .
See id .
" [ T ] he interests of the employee in his own mobility and betterment are deemed paramount to the competitive business interests of the [ former ] employer .
. . . "
Id . at 900 ( quoting Diodes , Inc. v. Franzen , 260 Cal. App. 2d 244 , 255 ( 1968 ) ) .
California steadfastly adheres to its fundamental public policy , notwithstanding that other states hold a differing view .
See Hill Med. Corp. v. Wycoff , 86 Cal App. 4th 895 , 900-01 ( 2001 ) .
3 . Google and Dr. Lee submit that this action thus must proceed to resolve the present case under the law of California .
This Court 's ruling on the pure question of law that Google and Dr. Lee present in their declaratory relief action need not await the outcome of the lengthy and fact - based proceedings mandated by Washington law regarding the enforceability of covenants not to compete .
Put simply , Google 's principal place of business is in California and Dr. Lee is a California resident .
This Court is uniquely situated to determine as expeditiously as possible the rights of the parties under California law .

Mystery object found in supernova's heart Embedded in the heart of a supernova remnant 10,000 light - years away is a stellar object the likes of which astronomers have never seen before in our galaxy .
At first glance , the object looks like a densely packed stellar corpse known as a neutron star surrounded by a bubble of ejected stellar material , exactly what would be expected in the wake of a supernova explosion .
However , a closer 24.5 - hour examination with the European Space Agency 's XMM Newton X - ray satellite reveals that the energetic X - ray emissions of the blue , point - like object cycles every 6.7 hours — tens of thousands of times longer than expected for a freshly created neutron star .
It is behavior that 's more commonly seen in neutron stars that have been around for several million years , researchers say .
" The behavior we see is especially puzzling in view of its young age , less than 2,000 years , " said study leader Andrea De Luca of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica ( INAF ) in Milan .
" For years we have had a sense that the object is different , but we never knew how different until now , " De Luca said .
The finding is detailed in the July 7 issue of the journal Science .
Novel stage ?
Called 1E161348-5055 , or 1E for short , the object is embedded almost in the exact center of RCW103 , a supernova remnant located 10,000 light - years away in the constellation Norma .
Astronomers think that 1E and RCW103 were both born in the same catastrophic event .
Like other neutron stars , which form when a star at least eight times more massive than the Sun runs out of fuel and explodes as a supernova , 1E is estimated to be only about 12.5 miles ( 20 km ) across .
One explanation for the neutron star 's strange behavior is that it might be a magnetar , an exotic subclass of highly magnetized neutron stars .
Of the dozen or so magnetars that are known , however , most usually spin several times per minute — much faster than 1E .
This explanation might still work , however , if the magnetar is surrounded by a debris disk that is helping to slow down the neutron star 's spin .
This scenario has never been observed before and would mark the discovery of a novel stage in neutron star evolution if confirmed .
One or two ?
Another explanation , scientists say , is that 1E is part of a binary system with a normal , low - mass star with only half the mass , or less , of our sun .
Such X - ray binary systems are known , but they usually involve systems that are millions of times older than 1E .
Despite the many speculations , the short answer is that scientists simply do n't yet know how to explain 1E 's strange behavior .
" RCW103 is an enigma , " said study team member Giovanni Bignami , director of the Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements ( CESR ) in France .
" When we do figure this out , we 're going to learn a lot more about supernovae , neutron stars and their evolution . "

Congresswoman on page board buried file on husband 's child abuse allegation Brian Beutler
Published : Thursday October 19 , 2006 Print This Email
This A file allegedly suppressed by Congresswoman Heather Wilson ( R- NM ) has been obtained by RAW STORY .
In 1995 , just three days into her tenure as Secretary of the New Mexico Children , Youth and Families Department , Wilson removed a routine working file alleging that her husband had engaged in inappropriate contact with a minor .
The file was then transferred to the department 's attorney in her own Albuquerque office , where it soon went missing .
At the time , a local investigative news team learned about the swap , but could not confirm certain details of the file .
They were not able to recover the document itself .
More than ten years later , RAW STORY has uncovered and confirmed the authenticity of the police incident report believed to be contained in the missing dossier .
Filed as a case of child abuse in 1993 , it contends that Wilson 's husband Jay Hone , an Albuquerque attorney , touched a then - 16 year old boy " in a manner that was not welcome . "
Charges were never filed against her husband , but Wilson 's handling of the affair drew the ire of Bob Schwartz who at the time served as district attorney in Bernalillo County .
He described Wilson 's actions to the news team as " absolutely inappropriate , " citing her " obvious conflict of interest . "
He also admonished Wilson for not following official procedure for the removal of official documents .
" If this file is behind Secretary Wilson 's desk , " Schwartz said , " then she should n't be behind this desk anymore .
She should resign . "
Wilson originally denied to the news team that she had removed the file .
Footage from that investigation was available on the internet site YouTube as recently as several days ago , but has since been removed by the site over concerns regarding copyright infringment .
In that video , also uncovered by RAW STORY , Wilson flatly denies ordering the removal of the document .
The Congresswoman ultimately admitted to doing so in a press conference just days later .
Six years after the incident , in 2001 , Wilson began a three year term on the House Page Board , where she sat while rumors of Mark Foley 's inappropriate behavior with underage men were reportedly widespread .
Her campaign staff told the Albuquerque Tribune that she only became aware of the Congressman 's behavior after an ABC news report on the matter prompted him to resign .
Wilson also currently serves on the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children 's caucus .

Mrs Magilton said police treated her like a criminal
Mary Magilton , 54 , of Moorside in Oldham , Greater Manchester , was told she could not use " words like that " to describe someone in a statement .
The mother - of - three said Greater Manchester Police made her feel like a criminal for using the description .
The force said their officers follow an " appropriate language guide " to help staff be professional and correct .
But the guide clearly states : " When taking a witness statement from a member of the public , be aware of the evidential need to record the witness 's exact words . "
The policy is aimed at ensuring that honest mistakes through lack of knowledge or insensitivity can be corrected
Greater Manchester Police
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said : " Our policy covers issues relating to race , disability , gender , religion , sexuality and age , and includes operational guidance and information on where to seek advice .
" The policy , which is regularly reviewed and updated , is aimed at ensuring that honest mistakes through lack of knowledge or insensitivity can be corrected . "
The spokesman suggested an alternative description to use would be " of heavy build " .
' Casual remark '
The mother - of - three was hit by the motorist last month as she was talking to friends on the pavement at the junction of Ripponden Road and Turf Pit Lane in Oldham .
A Citroen C3 caught her on the back of her leg , leaving her with cuts and severe bruising .
She said she made the remark when asked to describe the woman driver to police .
" It was just a casual remark which I thought most people would use .
They made me feel like a criminal and I have never committed a crime in all my life . "
She added : " I would never use a word that someone might find offensive .
" I was treated horribly , it 's so silly , the world has gone mad .
Political correctness has gone mad . "
How many indecency complaints does the FCC actually receive ?
It 's a hot - button topic — television broadcasters have already begun to censor themselves out of uncertainty about what is considered indecent and obscene .
Because of the intense media coverage of the issue , readers might get the impression that indecency complaints are legion , that millions of Americans are up in arms about what 's on television .
That 's not the case .
Ars has compiled a surprising set of statistics on the practice , drawn from the FCC 's own quarterly reports .
They show a generally low level of complaints punctuated by massive — but occasional — spikes , most of which are fueled by " family - friendly " activist groups like the Parents Television Council ( " Because our children are watching " ) .
Let 's run the numbers .
The graph below shows the total number of indecency complaints received by the FCC in the second quarter of each year for the last five years .
It 's a good way to get a feel for how much fluctuation there is in the level of complaints .
In April , May , and June of 2002 , for instance , only 141 people in the entire country filed an FCC complaint .
In the same three months of 2003 , 351 people objected .
Then , in 2004 , something remarkable happened : 272,818 people filed complaints in a single quarter .
Had television suddenly started peddling prime - time pornography ?
Of course not .
What had happened was a certain " wardrobe malfunction " at the 2004 Super Bowl .
The brief flash of Janet Jackson 's pasty - covered breast outraged conservatives across the country .
More importantly , it outraged the Parents Television Council ( whose children , remember , are watching ) , which mounted one of its many campaigns to flood the FCC with complaints .
By all accounts , it was successful ; an FCC estimate concluded that more than 99 percent of the complaints received came from the PTC .
In fact , their performance in Q1 of 2004 was even more impressive , as 693,080 complaints flooded the FCC .
In April , the first month of the second quarter , more than 270,000 complaints were filed .
And then , like sunshine after shower , peace returned .
By May , only 1,696 indecency complaints were filed , and in June , that number fell to 835 .
TV , apparently , had gotten 323 times " cleaner " in only two months .
What the graph shows is that the indecency complaints made so much of in the media do not represent a huge swath of dissatisfaction with television .
They represent occasional and reflexive spasms of outrage , many triggered or spurred on by activist groups .
Is " family - friendly " really family - friendly ?
A little trashing of the PTC is usual in these types of analyses .
The outrage they inspire is " manufactured , " it is sometimes said , the complaints are n't " real . "
The PTC web site allows ( and encourages ) people to complain to the FCC , sometimes including video clips of the offending TV segments so that viewers who may not have seen the show can work up a righteous head of steam .
But this is the way that activist groups operate .
They monitor situations that people across the country do n't have time to look into on their own , and they notify those people when something of interest happens , then help them to take action .
It 's true of Amnesty International , the EFF , and the PTC .
As long as the complaints represent the legitimate views of actual Americans , it 's fine .
The real problem with the PTC complaints is that the organization uses " indecency criteria " so simplistic that they makes Blue 's Clues look like a college philosophy course .
They rate shows based on " sex , " " language , " " violence , " and " overall . "
Curse words — bad for children !
Shows stuffed with nothing but consumerism , tawdry celebrity , and mockery of those who can't hold a tune — good for children !
Consider Everybody Loves Raymond , which received " green lights " in all four PTC categories .
In promoting the show as a family - friendly offering , the PTC notes that " Raymond promotes the idea of long - lasting marriage , and Debra feels fulfilled in her role as a stay - at - home mom .
Language on this series used to be harsh , but since the first of 2004 [ sic ] , has dropped to a record low number of just 8 uses of mild ' hell , ' ' crap , ' and ' damn ' in 6 episodes .
Sexual references have been non-existent since January 2004 . "
The focus is on specifics : exact words , number of uses , etc .
While the PTC does point to the fact that the couple remain married and that Debra " feels fulfilled , " it 's arguable whether the show portrays family in such a way that anyone would want to have one .
The main characters show little affection for one another , the jokes routinely come at the expense of spouses , and the whole milieu feels joyless and barren .
Regardless of how " mild " the show 's use of " hell , " " crap , " and " damn " may be , it 's a show that makes me viscerally uncomfortable to watch , and it's not the kind of thing I want my kids to see .
Your mileage may vary , of course , but that 's exactly the point .
Rather than give parents the tools they need to make a holistic judgment about particular programs , groups like the PTC adopt a set of legalistic criteria that may end up approving shows which are not , in reality , friendly to families at all .
While Everybody Loves Raymond , Dancing with the Stars , and American Idol might be " safe , " they are hardly the sort of high - quality material that young minds should be fed .

The inanities one observes when watching Congress in action exceed those which one finds anywhere else on the planet outside of the right - wing blogosphere .
At today 's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to which I am currently ( and quite temporarily ) subjecting myself , starring Alberto Gonzales : Orrin Hatch spent the first two minutes of his time " questioning " Gonzales by lauding Gonzales ' extreme integrity and diligence during this Grave and Epic War on Terrorism that America faces , explaining that everything they 've done is critical to protecting us and describing the time in which Gonzales is Attorney General as one of the most difficult and important in history --
Hatch emphasized that he means not only U.S. history , but in the history of the whole , wide world .
That is really what he said .
He did not ask one question about anything the DOJ is doing with regard to this Most Important Matter Ever .
Hatch then spent the rest of his time ( all 6 minutes ) demanding that Gonzales and the Justice Department devote much more of its resources and attention -- including FBI agents , other law - enforcement resources and a new task force -- to enforcing anti-obscenity laws against people in the U.S. who produce pornography , particularly those who sell it over the Internet , and urged that whole new laws be created to criminalize Internet pornography .
Hatch praised the anti-pornography law passed last year called " The Adam Walsh Act " ( guided through Congress by its main sponsor , Republican Congressman Mark Foley ) , but then insisted that whole new laws and far more substantial efforts were required to battle the perverse and destructive wickendness of sex films .
Gonzales assured him they were devoting many investigative resources to enforcing obscenity laws .
Or , to put it another way , the Terrorists pose such a grave danger to our Republic that it is the most threatening and important time Ever , justifying whole new expansions of government power and total government secrecy in order to protect us and to win this War because the Terrorists want to kill us all , and our law enforcement resources should therefore be poured into imprisoning people who make adult films and putting an end to pornography .
That 's what Orrin Hatch said today .* * * * * * * * This is what I have learned so far :
All of the Senators are very " concerned " and sometimes even " disturbed " about many things , almost all of them different for each Senator .
Gonzales definitely shares their concerns about everything , and assures them he takes it very seriously and he is happy to sit down with them and explore ways to fix / improve / think about it .
For any information the Senators want , Gonzales does not have it , but he will definitely endeavor to get it for them .
When pointed out that he has made the same promises many times before and told them nothing , he assures them them he is working diligently to get it , but that it is a very complex matter , and they are entitled to it and will have it ( sometimes he politely denies ever having promised it before but then says he will get it anyway ) .
Sen .
Feingold is starting now so I am hoping matters will take a more susbtantive and consequential turn .* * * * * * * * Feingold began by pointing out that the administration , including Gonzales , has many times accused opponents of the " Terrorist Surveillance Program " -- meaning those who insisted that eavesdropping take place within the law , within the FISA framework -- of " opposing eavesdropping on terrorists " ( I can find 20 examples in 5 minutes of that ) .
Feingold 's first question - " do you know ofin the country who opposed eavesdropping on terrorists ?
" Gonzales : Sure - if you look at blogs today , there is a lot of concern about all types of eavesdropping , who do n't want us eavesdropping at all .
Feingold :
Do you know anyonewho ever took that position ?
Gonzales :
No , but that is not what I said .
Feingold :
It is a disgrace and disservice to your office and the President to have accused people on this Committee of opposing eavesdropping on terrorists .
Gonzales : I did n't havein mind orwhen I referred to people who oppose eavesdropping on terrorists .
Perish the thought .
Feingold :
Oh , well it 's nice that you did n't have us " in your mind " when making those accusations , but given that you and the President were running around the country accusing people of opposing eavesdropping on terrorists in the middle of an election , the fact that you did n't have Congressional Democrats in " mind " is n't significant .
Your intent was to make people think that anyone who opposed the " TSP " did not want to eavesdrop on terrorists , even though that was false .
No Democrats oppose eavesdropping on terrorists .
Gonzales : I was n't referring to Democrats .
So , apparently , all those speeches Bush officials and their supporters have spent the last year giving accusing people of opposing eavesdropping on terrorists , and all the television commericals making the same accusations throughout the months leading up to the election , were not about Democrats at all , but were about random bloggers who are against all eavesdropping .
Where ?
Maybe on Smirking Chimp and Democratic Underground .is who they meant when they were talking about opposing eavesdropping on Osama bin Laden .
They did n't mean Democrats in Congress .
The entire campaign and all of those accusations were directed only to the bloggers who do n't want them eavesdropping at all .
I confess to finding that exchange deeply revolting though satisfying at the same time .
Ca n't they just all yield all of their time to Feingold ?* * * * * Their chat ended with Gonzales solemnly assuring all Americans that even though the " Terrorist Surveillance Program " has ended , they are still engaging in full - scale eavesdropping and , as a result , Americans are " no less safe " today than they were before .
In response , Feingold pointed out the painfully obvious -- that that was theall along -- that there was no need whatsoever to eavesdrop outside of FISA and the adminstration 's claims that our security depended upon FISA - violating eavesdropping was completely and entirely false .* * * * * Schumer begins by making clear that he is not satisfied with this FISC agreement - he says " Clearly , ' the agreement ' is better than ' Cheney , ' but we do n't know what ' this agreement ' is .
" First question -
Do you continue to believe that you have the right to eavesdrop outside of FISA ?
You said you did have that power still , so what stops you from just starting to eavesdrop outside of FISA again a month from now ?
Gonzales :
What we did in the past was lawful .
Schumer :
Then you can , at will , just as you instituted this program , you could just go back to it if you get a decision you do n't like .
Next question :
Is the FISC order you got a case - by - case basis order , a program - wide basis , or something broader ?
If it is a very broad - brush approval , it does n't do any good .
There is no way to compromise security interests by answering the question .
Gonzales : I am not at liberty to talk about those specifics .
To do so requires disclosure of operational details .
What I will tell you is that everything is in compliance with FISA .
All members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee have been briefed .
Schumer : Sen. Rockefeller said you did n't brief him .
Even Republicans have said in newspapers that the briefing was inadequate and that these are program warrants , and we have to assume that they are program warrants , and it does n't do anything to satisfy constitutional protections .
Are there any specificity in these warrants ?
Gonzales : I can tell you everything complies with FISA ( i.e. , I wo n't tell you anything ) .
Schumer :
You claim it took you two years to negotiate these new FISA rules .
That was more time than you took to plan the war on Iraq .
Why would it possibly have taken so long to get these rules in place if you were really trying ?
Gonzales :
It 's very , very complex .
It took a long time .
We 've been trying the whole time to find a way to get it into FISA .
Gonzales keeps saying that they gave these great briefings to everyone on the Intelligence Committee about the new FISA process , but here is what the reported this morning : I know the answers from Gonzales seem comically non-responsive , even robotic , but I am fairly summarizing them .
That is how he testifies - he comes prepared with a menu of empty , platitudinous buzzphrases that he repeats over and over no matter the question .
They really could easily devise a very simple Alberto Gonzales Testifying computer program .
He does n't have very many phrases in his arsenal so nothing more complex than DOS - era technology would do the trick , literally .
Leahy said they were going to try to get the FISC order from the head FISC judge and pointed out that Gonzales keeps saying how great the briefings were but everyone who was briefed said they learned nothing ( just as was true for everyone who watched these hearings ) .
He also pointed out that all of this does n't obscure the fact that " the law is the law . "
They definitely seem angry and diligent , but we 'll see if that is followed up by real action .* * * * * * What seems to have happened is that they convinced one single FISA judge whom they like to sign a broad , sweeping Order allowing them to do everything they were doing before but declaring it all to be in compliance with FISA .
That is why the Committee Democrats are so eager to get the Order .
But , as Schumer pointed out , they could just start eavesdropping without FISA warrants again any time they want because they continue to insist that they have that power .
And if they did , we would never know ( unless someone told Jim Risen again ) .
That seems like a very compelling reason why the court should continue to decide whether they , in fact , broke the law .
The question is not moot even though they are claiming to have stopped warrantless eavesdropping because the conduct in question is both capable of reptition and likely to evade review ( because it will be done in secret ) .
I also think Gonzales has made them sufficiently angry that it will ensure investigations into the program , engendering battles to get information about what they are doing now and , most importantly , what they did before .
The administration , needless to say , has not changed one iota as a result of the election and they will not change one iota unless they are forced to .
It remains to be seen whether Democrats are up to that .* * * * * * I was on Democracy Now this morning with Amy Goodman briefly talking about these matters and the transcript is available here .
I also have an article in today concerning the FISA story which is , in essence , a summary of the two posts I wrote about it yesterday .* * * * * * The one important fact which I neglected to mention was that Gonzales -- in order to placate Hatch 's deep and intense pornography " concerns " -- proudly touted what he called " theprosecution , " the epic criminal case where the DOJ prosecuted the producer of that series for failing to keep his paperwork in compliance with the onerous document provisions imposed by one of Mark Foley 's many new pornography laws .
So in the middle of the Epic , Overarching , Greatest and Most Important War of Civilizations of this Time and Any Other Time , Alberto Gonzales and Orrin Hatch spent their time at a Congressional hearing designed to exercise Justice Department oversight talking solmenly about * * * * *'s
Dan Froomkin finds some excellent examples where the President previously ( a ) insisted that he could not protect the country if he were forced to eavesdrop within the FISA framework and ( b ) accused Democrats -- not bloggers , but Democrats -- of opposing eavesdropping on terrorists :
The claim that people who opposed warrantless eavesdropping were " opposed to eavesdropping on terrorists " was always an outright lie - one of the very , very few times I have ever applied that term when analyzing or arguing political debates .
To say that Democrats ( and other critics of the " TSP " ) opposed eavesdropping on terrorists is not spin .
It is just a lie .
Democratseavesdropping on terrorists , which is what FISA permits .
And the administration knew that .
Yet they continuously said otherwise .
And now that Gonzales has to face the people whom he and his Leader falsely accused , he cowardly claims that he never meant them at all , but instead was only referring to some random unnamed blogger who supposedly opposes all eavesdropping , even on The Terrorists .
Pretending that the accusation was n't directed at Democrats when he has to answer them face - to - face is as cowardly as the original accusations were dishonest .

THE GOD DELUSION
by Richard Dawkins
FROM CHAPTER 7 : The " Good " Book and the changing moral Zeitgeist
There are two ways in which scripture might be a source of morals or rules for living .
One is by direct instruction , for example through the Ten Commandments , which are the subject of such bitter contention in the culture wars of America 's boondocks .
The other is by example : God , or some other biblical character , might serve as - to use the contemporary jargon - a role model .
Both scriptural routes , if followed through religiously ( the adverb is used in its metaphoric sense but with an eye to its origin ) , encourage a system of morals which any civilized modern person , whether religious or not , would find - I can put it no more gently - obnoxious .
To be fair , much of the Bible is not systematically evil but just plain weird , as you would expect of a chaotically cobbled - together anthology of disjointed documents , composed , revised , translated , distorted and ' improved ' by hundreds of anonymous authors , editors and copyists , unknown to us and mostly unknown to each other , spanning nine centuries .
This may explain some of the sheer strangeness of the Bible .
But unfortunately it is this same weird volume that religious zealots hold up to us as the inerrant source of our morals and rules for living .
Those who wish to base their morality literally on the Bible have either not read it or not understood it , as Bishop John Shelby Spong , in The Sins of Scripture , rightly observed .
Bishop Spong , by the way , is a nice example of a liberal bishop whose beliefs are so advanced as to be almost unrecognizable to the majority of those who call themselves Christians .
A British counterpart is Richard Holloway , recently retired as Bishop of Edinburgh .
Bishop Holloway even describes himself as a ' recovering Christian ' .
I had a public discussion with him in Edinburgh , which was one of the most stimulating and interesting encounters I have had .
THE OLD TESTAMENT
Begin in Genesis with the well - loved story of Noah , derived from the Babylonian myth of Uta - Napisthim and known from the older mythologies of several cultures .
The legend of the animals going into the ark two by two is charming , but the moral of the story of Noah is appalling .
God took a dim view of humans , so he ( with the exception of one family ) drowned the lot of them including children and also , for good measure , the rest of the ( presumably blameless ) animals as well .
Of course , irritated theologians will protest that we do n't take the book of Genesis literally any more .
But that is my whole point !
We pick and choose which bits of scripture to believe , which bits to write off as symbols or allegories .
Such picking and choosing is a matter of personal decision , just as much , or as little , as the atheist 's decision to follow this moral precept or that was a personal decision , without an absolute foundation .
If one of these is ' morality flying by the seat of its pants ' , so is the other .
In any case , despite the good intentions of the sophisticated theologian , a frighteningly large number of people still do take their scriptures , including the story of Noah , literally .
According to Gallup , they include approximately 50 per cent of the US electorate .
Also , no doubt , many of those Asian holy men who blamed the 2004 tsunami not on a plate tectonic shift but on human sins , ranging from drinking and dancing in bars to breaking some footling sabbath rule .
Steeped in the story of Noah , and ignorant of all except biblical learning , who can blame them ?
Their whole education has led them to view natural disasters as bound up with human affairs , paybacks for human misdemeanours rather than anything so impersonal as plate tectonics .
By the way , what presumptuous egocentricity to believe that earth - shaking events , on the scale at which a god ( or a tectonic plate ) might operate , must always have a human connection .
Why should a divine being , with creation and eternity on his mind , care a fig for petty human malefactions ?
We humans give ourselves such airs , even aggrandizing our poky little ' sins ' to the level of cosmic significance !
When I interviewed for television the Reverend Michael Bray , a prominent American anti-abortion activist , I asked him why evangelical Christians were so obsessed with private sexual inclinations such as homosexuality , which did n't interfere with anybody else 's life .
His reply invoked something like self - defence .
Innocent citizens are at risk of becoming collateral damage when God chooses to strike a town with a natural disaster because it houses sinners .
In 2005 , the fine city of New Orleans was catastrophically flooded in the aftermath of a hurricane , Katrina .
The Reverend Pat Robertson , one of America 's best - known televangelists and a former presidential candidate , was reported as blaming the hurricane on a lesbian comedian who happened to live in New Orleans . *
You'd think an omnipotent God would adopt a slightly more targeted approach to zapping sinners : a judicious heart attack , perhaps , rather than the wholesale destruction of an entire city just because it happened to be the domicile of one lesbian comedian .
In November 2005 , the citizens of Dover , Pennsylvania voted off their local school board the entire slate of fundamentalists who had brought the town notoriety , not to say ridicule , by attempting to enforce the teaching of ' intelligent design ' .
When Pat Robertson heard that the fundamentalists had been democratically defeated at the ballot , he offered a stern warning to Dover :
I 'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover , if there is a disaster in your area , do n't turn to God .
You just rejected him from your city , and do n't wonder why he has n't helped you when problems begin , if they begin , and I 'm not saying they will .
But if they do , just remember you just voted God out of your city .
And if that 's the case , then do n't ask for his help , because he might not be there .
Pat Robertson would be harmless comedy , were he less typical of those who today hold power and influence in the United States .
In the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , the Noah equivalent , chosen to be spared with his family because he was uniquely righteous , was Abraham 's nephew Lot .
Two male angels were sent to Sodom to warn
Lot to leave the city before the brimstone arrived .
Lot hospitably welcomed the angels into his house , whereupon all the men of Sodom gathered around and demanded that Lot should hand the angels over so that they could ( what else ? ) sodomize them : ' Where are the men which came in to thee this night ?
Bring them out unto us , that we may know them ' ( Genesis 19 : 5 ) .
Yes , ' know ' has the Authorized Version 's usual euphemistic meaning , which is very funny in the context .
Lot 's gallantry in refusing the demand suggests that God might have been onto something when he singled him out as the only good man in Sodom .
But Lot 's halo is tarnished by the terms of his refusal : ' I pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
Behold now , I have two daughters which have not known man ; let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : only unto these men do nothing ; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof ' ( Genesis 19 : 7 - 8 ) .
Whatever else this strange story might mean , it surely tells us something about the respect accorded to women in this intensely religious culture .
As it happened , Lot 's bargaining away of his daughters ' virginity proved unnecessary , for the angels succeeded in repelling the marauders by miraculously striking them blind .
They then warned Lot to decamp immediately with his family and his animals , because the city was about to be destroyed .
The whole household escaped , with the exception of Lot 's unfortunate wife , whom the Lord turned into a pillar of salt because she committed the offence - comparatively mild , one might have thought - of looking over her shoulder at the fireworks display .
Lot 's two daughters make a brief reappearance in the story .
After their mother was turned into a pillar of salt , they lived with their father in a cave up a mountain .
Starved of male company , they decided to make their father drunk and copulate with him .
Lot was beyond noticing when his elder daughter arrived in his bed or when she left , but he was not too drunk to impregnate her .
The next night the two daughters agreed it was the younger one 's turn .
Again
Lot was too drunk to notice , and he impregnated her too ( Genesis 19 : 31 - 6 ) .
If this dysfunctional family was the best Sodom had to offer by way of morals , some might begin to feel a certain sympathy with God and his judicial brimstone .
* It is unclear whether the story ... is true .
Whether true or not , it is widely believed , no doubt because it is entirely typical of utterances by evangelical clergy , including Robertson , on disasters such as Katrina .
...
The website that says the Katrina story is untrue ... also quotes Robertson as saying , of an earlier Gay Pride march in Orlando , Florida , ' I would warn Orlando that you 're right in the way of some serious hurricanes , and I do n't think I 'd be waving those flags in God 's face if I were you . '
FROM CHAPTER EIGHT :
What 's wrong with religion ?
Why be so hostile ?
In July 2005 , London was the victim of a concerted suicide bomb attack : three bombs in the subway and one in a bus .
Not as bad as the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center , and certainly not as unexpected ( indeed , London had been braced for just such an event ever since Blair volunteered us as unwilling side - kicks in Bush 's invasion of Iraq ) , nevertheless the London explosions horrified Britain .
The newspapers were filled with agonized appraisals of what drove four young men to blow themselves up and take a lot of innocent people with them .
The murderers were British citizens , cricket - loving , well - mannered , just the sort of young men whose company one might have enjoyed .
Why did these cricket - loving young men do it ?
Unlike their Palestinian counterparts , or their kamikaze counterparts in Japan , or their Tamil Tiger counterparts in Sri Lanka , these human bombs had no expectation that their bereaved families would be lionized , looked after or supported on martyrs ' pensions .
On the contrary , their relatives in some cases had to go into hiding .
One of the men wantonly widowed his pregnant wife and orphaned his toddler .
The action of these four young men has been nothing short of a disaster not just for themselves and their victims , but for their families and for the whole Muslim community in Britain , which now faces a backlash .
Only religious faith is a strong enough force to motivate such utter madness in otherwise sane and decent people .
Once again , Sam Harris put the point with percipient bluntness , taking the example of the Al - Qaida leader Osama bin Laden ( who had nothing to do with the London bombings , by the way ) .
Why would anyone want to destroy the World Trade Center and everybody in it ?
To call bin Laden ' evil ' is to evade our responsibility to give a proper answer to such an important question .
The answer to this question is obvious - if only because it has been patiently articulated ad nauseam by bin Laden himself .
The answer is that men like bin Laden actually believe what they say they believe .
They believe in the literal truth of the Koran .
Why did nineteen well - educated middle - class men trade their lives in this world for the privilege of killing thousands of our neighbors ?
Because they believed that they would go straight to paradise for doing so .
It is rare to find the behavior of humans so fully and satisfactorily explained .
Why have we been so reluctant to accept this explanation ? "
The respected journalist Muriel Gray , writing in the ( Glasgow ) Herald on 24 July 2005 , made a similar point , in this case with reference to the London bombings .
Everyone is being blamed , from the obvious villainous duo of George W. Bush and Tony Blair , to the inaction of Muslim ' communities ' .
But it has never been clearer that there is only one place to lay the blame and it has ever been thus .
The cause of all this misery , mayhem , violence , terror and ignorance is of course religion itself , and if it seems ludicrous to have to state such an obvious reality , the fact is that the government and the media are doing a pretty good job of pretending that it is n't so .
Our Western politicians avoid mentioning the R word ( religion ) , and instead characterize their battle as a war against ' terror ' , as though terror were a kind of spirit or force , with a will and a mind of its own .
Or they characterize terrorists as motivated by pure ' evil ' .
But they are not motivated by evil .
However misguided we may think them , they are motivated , like the Christian murderers of abortion doctors , by what they perceive to be righteousness , faithfully pursuing what their religion tells them .
They are not psychotic ; they are religious idealists who , by their own lights , are rational .
They perceive their acts to be good , not because of some warped personal idiosyncrasy , and not because they have been possessed by Satan , but because they have been brought up , from the cradle , to have total and unquestioning faith .

It 's amazing how every state that has switched to these machines end up having problems , which magically end up getting blamed on " human error " .
Lou is right on the money - the human error is the decision to use these machines .
Many states jumped on the decision to use these machines without fully investigating the security flaws they possess .
Now that investigation has been done for them by Princeton University , who has just released a full report along with a video demonstration of insecure these machines actually are .
Nate has all the details on this new study .
Last weekend in Portland , Matt Pascarella , chief elections researcher for Greg Palast , gave a presentation to the National Summit to Save Our Elections .
He presented his research to - date on the privatization of centralized voter registration databases under Section 303 of the Help America Vote Act.
Special thanks to Kat L'Estrange ( pictured to the right with Matt ) and Beth Hahn as well as all of the organizers who put together the conference .
The article below is a brief write - up from Scoop about his talk .
( Portland , OR ) Matthew Pascarella offered a clear reason for concern about the imminent privatization of state - wide centralized voter registration databases .
Section 303 of the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) requires all states to complete this process within the next three months .
These databases will be the gateway to voting and the fences that keep people from the polls .
Given the 2000 Presidential Election in Florida where over 90,000 voters were disenfranchised due to state computerization activities ; there is real cause for concern .
Pascarella is a researcher , writer , and producer for Greg Palast .
Palast and his team of investigators broke the major story on the erroneous 2000 Florida election “ felon purge ” list that disproportionately disenfranchised tens of thousands of African Americans .
Recently , state governments have sought out private vendors to design , manage , network , and maintain these centralized voter registration databases mandated by Section 303 of the Help America Vote Act .
Companies including Diebold , Quest , Unisys and Accenture are gaining major contracts and competing for more by promising individual states that their company will bring them into federal compliance .
Pascarella 's research has shown states are entering into no -bid contracts that often shed corporate liability .
Often , companies cannot be held responsible for delays , cost overruns , and failing to meet federal requirements .
Accenture currently has four contracts for centralized registration databases .
This is of real concern based on their performance for the state of Florida in 2004 .
Accenture received a $ 2 million contract to create a state - wide voter registration list that was to serve as the basis for a new purge of felons from Florida 's voting rolls .
Amid litigation from various media companies prior to the 2004 election , Pascarella and his team of researchers obtained the Accenture list from a source and began examining it .
They quickly noticed that less than 1/2 of one percent of the names were of Hispanic origin .
Given the substantial Hispanic population in Florida , this seemed both odd and perhaps intentional .
After all , Hispanics represent about 20 % of Florida 's population and they are very active in local , state and national politics .
They also tend to vote in large numbers .
The 2004 Accenture purge list for Florida also included numerous individuals wrongly purged on the 2000 purge list – individuals that were supposed to have their voter rights reinstated per court order following a lawsuit over the 2000 scrub list .
According to sources , despite these huge mistakes managing the 2004 purge list in Florida , Accenture continues to consult the state of Florida on the development of its centralized voter registration database .
Of greater concern is the fact that four additional states have contracts with Accenture .
These include Colorado , Wyoming , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin .
According to Pascarella , there have been major “ glitches ” and other problems in practically every state contracted by Accenture and many of the state 's databases will not make the HAVA deadline , potentially jeopardizing millions in federal funding and shifting the burden to tax payers in those states .

GOP Senator Burns : ' Faceless ' terrorists ' drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night '
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday August 31 , 2006
At a fundraiser on Wednesday featuring First Lady Laura Bush , Montana 's Republican Senator Conrad Burns said that " faceless " terrorists " drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night . "
Wednesday 's invitation - only reception was held at Arlin 's Aircraft Hangar at Gallatin Field in Belgrade , Montana , and was closed to the public .
" Burns talked about the war on terrorism , saying a ' faceless enemy ' of terrorists ' drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night , ' " the Associated Press reports .
In her speech , the first lady praised Burns for talking about terrorism with " civility and respect . "
" Ending our dependence on foreign oil , reforming our immigration system , rebuilding the Gulf Coast and keeping our country safe from terrorism are not easy tasks , but they 're absolutely vital goals , " said Bush .
" And to accomplish them , we must have serious national conversations conducted with civility and respect , " Bush said .
" And Conrad Burns is a positive and powerful part of that dialogue . "
" About 300 donors paid $ 250 each to attend the ice cream social in an aircraft hangar at the Gallatin Field airport in Belgrade , " the Associated Press reports .
" A $ 2,100 donation allowed donors to have pictures taken with Bush , the campaign said . "
Like Virginia 's Republican Senator George Allen who recently stirred up some controversy after referring to a Democratic campaign worker as " Macaca , " Burns has also made some provocative statements that some critics call racially - based .
" He has drawn criticism in recent weeks for calling his house painter a ' nice little Guatemalan man ' during a June speech , " Matt Gouras reports for the Associated Press .
" Burns , whose re-election campaign is pressing for tighter immigration controls , also suggested that the man might be an illegal immigrant . "
The latest poll conducted by Rasmussen shows Burns and Democratic challenger Jon Tester running neck and neck at 47 percent apiece .
To stay alive , we have to meet a deadline .
If man does not stop burning fossil fuels , by the year 3000 , rising oceans will drown many countries and cities , and temperatures will have risen by as much as 15 degree Centigrade .
Global warming could quadruple by 2100 .
Abrupt climate changes will become routine .
Ocean water will become less acidic , throwing the marine ecosystem out of gear and resulting in catastrophic results for the earth .
These are the findings of a study called Climate Change on the Millenial Timescale by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research for the United Kingdom 's Environment Agency .
And it 's not just the British study - which is the first to examine the impacts of global warming beyond the end of this century -- that urges mankind to save itself right now .
Jim Hansen , a climate change scientist with America 's National Aeronautics and Space Administration told the British newspaper The Independent : ' I think sea - level rise is going to be the big issue soon , more even than warming itself . '
The Tyndall Centre study says by 3000 oceans will rise by more than 11 metres if mankind ignore the peril the earth is in .
Hansen , director , NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York -- who is American President George W Bush 's top climate modeller -- said the Bush administration tried to gag him when he wanted to speak to the media about new satellite data of the Greenland ice cap .
' They ( the satellite data ) show that Greenland seems to be losing at least 200 cubic kilometres of ice a year , ' Hansen wrote in the as - told - to article in The Independent , adding that even two years ago , the ice cap was deemed to be stable .
The earth seems to be on the edge of a tipping point beyond which the melting ice would see huge armadas of icebergs floating in the ocean and drowning much of the earth , he wrote .
Both the British study and Hansen say the only way out is drastically cutting down carbon - based fuels and focusing on alternative energy sources .
Now .
In fact , the British study says mankind must stop all greenhouse gas emissions - caused by burning fossil fuel -- by 2200 .
And if we do n't take action now , both Hansen and the study emphasise , the earth may set in motion disastrous consequences that we would not be able to reverse later , even if we tried .

Mumbai to Katrina , blame it on yourself ?
Two days ago my post was submitted to Digg and Reddit , and although did n’t get on the homepage of either one , it still garnered some traffic .
Everyone always talks about the digg effect and what it does to their clicks and how their site can’t handle the additional traffic and even how to avoid it if were to ever happen to you .
But not everyone can get on the home page of these sites , it becomes the carrot that every webmaster / blogger / techie wants to achieve .
But just because you do n’t get on the homepage does n’t mean you still ca n’t experience some of the same joys .
But nobody speaks about this phenomenon .
Nobody speaks about the “ non-effect . ”
What is the “ non-effect ? ”
Well basically it ’s what I ’ve experienced , I would describe it as the shrapnel from the actual effect ..
After hitting Digg and Reddit my site experience a pretty major jump in traffic .
Not major jump is all relative I suppose .
The amount of traffic I was receiving previous was anywhere from 5 to 10 hits a day , once it hit this is the spike I saw .
Now all of this traffic was n’t from just Digg and Reddit .
As a consequence of the non-effect I also got picked up in a news.com blog article which generated some hits as well as being number 10 in the Hot Blogs of the Day .
Here ’s a break down of the amount of hits I got from each across the three days .
As you can see Digg took the crown here , but not by much .
Now remember , this is the non-effect so that means I got links from people surfing around on the particular sites and then clicking over to me .
Which brings me to my next point .
Although I got the most hits from Digg , Reddit actually provided more referral paths than Digg .
Based solely off of these findings it seems that the reddit users do more browsing of the site and will likely find your link buried somewhere deep , as apposed to Digg users who will typically only go one or two pages in .
Hopefully you find these stats interesting , it ’s always fun to watch your content being linked to and discussed .
I thought that these findings were interesting enough to share with the rest of the folks who will be stuck with the non-effect of these sites .
McCain Gets Boost From Bush 's Troubles / Senator greeted warmly at Commonwealth Club

Republican presidential hopeful Senator John McCain found himself the object of some new interest yesterday -- in part because of the current troubles of front - runner George W. Bush , now being dogged by questions about whether he used cocaine in the past .
McCain was met by a standing ovation in a speech before 800 Commonwealth Club of California members at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San Francisco , where he unveiled to the tech - savvy audience a proposal to boost the number of visas for skilled foreign high - tech workers .
He appeared on a radio talk show and also addressed The Chronicle 's editorial board .
But in a campaign day which keenly illustrated the ripple effects of the Bush controversy , McCain was repeatedly pressed at each appearance about the Texas governor 's handling of questions about possible past drug use .
Bush told reporters yesterday that he could have passed drug tests when his father , George Bush , became president in 1989 .
Later , his campaign expanded on that statement , effectively ruling out Bush 's use of illegal drugs since 1974 , when he was 28 .
That left other presidential hopefuls like McCain , campaigning a coast away , fielding questions ranging from whether the commander in chief should be held to the same standards as his subordinates ( yes ) , to whether Bush should answer the question ( it depends ) .
The growing discussion of Bush 's past was reflected in the views of some voters who came to hear McCain , citing the controversy as a factor in their changing views of the front - runner .
Republican loyalist Virginia Stafford of Moraga said she traveled to hear McCain 's Commonwealth Club speech yesterday in part because " Bush 's demeanor is beginning to bug me . "
In his handling of the drug question , " he seems short - tempered , and I do n't think he 's going to handle the tough problems with what 's required , " she said .
" I think McCain 's terrific . "
" Bush is trying too hard to be Mr. Personality , " said Joan Herron of Pacific Heights , who also came to hear the Arizona senator .
" I want to hear the issues debated .
. . .
It irritates me that ( Bush is ) being carried in by way of money . "
Indeed , as the national discussion about Bush revved up , some political insiders in rival camps were all but licking their chops .
" Seven years , 15 years , 25 years , " said one GOP strategist .
" I guess the stuff really does affect your memory . "
" He cannot continue to take the Fifth ( Amendment ) and get away with it , " said Democratic Party campaign adviser Bob Mulholland .
" He 's probably trying to remember what happened . "
For his part , McCain admitted to being " very uncomfortable " with the continual questions of Bush .
" The media and the American people have the right to make a judgment about him . . . ( but ) the governor is entitled to privacy . "
" I 've done things in my life I 'm not proud of .
. . .
I 'm a believer in redemption , and my life has been less than exemplary in many respects , " he said .
" I 'm responsible for the breakup of my first marriage . . . but I do n't want to go into the details , " he told KGO 's Ronn Owens .
But asked at The Chronicle editorial board meeting if the cocaine question was a fair one for a presidential candidate , McCain , 63 , said he had never used cocaine .
But " in my case , ( it ) was a no - brainer .
I grew up in the military .
I was in prison when most of this stuff was going on , " said McCain , referring to the 5 1/2 years he spent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam .
" So it 's almost unfair . . . .
I was never tempted .
In all candor , if everybody around me were using cocaine , I hope to God I would n't have used it . . . but I was n't subject to that temptation . "
But McCain said , " The American people and the media will somehow sort this whole thing out -- what is private , what is public , and what determines the qualifications of the president of the United States . "
JOHN McCAIN : IN HIS OWN WORDS
-- On abortion : " I 'd love to see a point where ( Roe vs. Wade ) is irrelevant , and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary .
But certainly in the short term , or even the long term , I would not support repeal of Roe vs .
Wade , which would then force X number of women in America to ( undergo ) illegal and dangerous operations . "
McCain said he would support legislation banning abortions in the third trimester .
--
On comments by presidential hopeful Orrin Hatch that the GOP should be proud " we do n't have the gays and lesbians with us " : " That , in no way , reflects the view of the Republicans whose support I seek .
I believe we , as the Republican Party , should be the party of Abraham Lincoln . "
He said he would " absolutely " support gays and lesbian appointments in his Cabinet and would not discriminate on the basis of race , religious beliefs or sexual orientation .
--
On his proposal to expand H - 1B visas for high - tech workers : " I am calling for a large - scale expansion of the H - 1B program , to make sure that qualified individuals from around the world can come to this country and achieve their own American dream . "
McCain added he has heard concerns that Silicon Valley companies are simply refusing to pay sufficient wages to skilled American workers , saying " that ought to be looked at . . . ( to see ) if this is some kind of high - level sweatshop operation . "
--
On his possible withdrawal from the Iowa Caucuses : " The reason why I 'm considering not going is because New Hampshire is the first secret ballot .
Iowa is a caucus , where people go down and listen to speeches for hours , and then raise their hands . . . so you can argue that . . . it 's not totally representative of Republicans .
I have a certain amount of time and assets to devote .
And we 're going to have to make a decision very soon as to whether we 'll go or not . "
-- Asked if he was beginning to " smell blood in the water " with regard to the media 's attitude toward George W. Bush : " I smelled some blood in the speeches he gave in Iowa .
. . .
You 've got to be a lot more specific ( on policy ) .
. . .
I 've decided to be as specific as I can as a candidate . "
We are living in Brazil .
The future as foretold by Terry Gilliam 's 1985 rich and multi-layered film masterpiece Brazil is upon us .
First released fifteen years ago , Terry Gilliam 's Brazil was astonishingly accurate in forecasting political trends .
In a previous essay , I examined the film as a critique of socialist central planning .
In this piece , I will discuss how Brazil portends Bush 's War on Terror .
The world of Brazil shows a totalitarian society in which freedom has been forfeited for a false promise of protection from terrorist attacks .
Gilliam shows how the threat of terrorism is manipulated by the state as a means of political control over the population .
The threat of terror is created by the internal security police in order to generate public acceptance of totalitarian police powers .
Gilliam 's exposition raises some important questions :
Is the terror created by the power of the state in the alleged pursuit of terrorism worse than the terrorism itself ?
And are they really any different ?
The ministers of state in Brazil have succeeded in creating a society organized around a continuous response to the threat of terrorism .
Random bombings occur regularly .
The protagonist Sam and his mother must go through a security check in order to enter a restaurant .
And then during their meal a large explosion blows out the back of the dining room ; they continue eating while bodies are dragged away .
As in modern America , there is some doubt about whether Brazil 's " War on Terrorism " is really working .
At the opening of the film Minister Helpmann , the Deputy Minister of information ( the internal security agency ) , appears on TV immediately after a bombing takes place :
INTERVIEWER :
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists ?
HELPMANN : Oh yes .
Our morale is much higher than theirs , we ’re fielding all their strokes , running a lot of them out , and pretty consistently knocking them for six .
I ’d say they ’re nearly out of the game .
INTERVIEWER :
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year .
HELPMANN : Beginner ’s luck .
Now in the US , we are told by the Bush administration that the war on terrorism will become a more or less permanent state of affairs .
U.S. war may last decades Military pushed to think broadly By KAREN MASTERSON
WASHINGTON  The U.S. war on terrorism may rage for decades and has forced Pentagon strategists to think more broadly than they ’ve had to since World War II , a top military official said Sunday .
“ The fact that it could last several years , or many years , or maybe our lifetimes would not surprise me , ” Gen. Richard B. Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Sunday on ABC’s This Week .
The film has been reissued on DVD with commentary by the director in which he states that it was his intention to convey that there were so many government plants , double agents , agents provocateurs , moles , infiltrators , etc. that at some point even the government did not know for sure whether there were any real terrorists or whether all of the terror was fabricated by the police as part of their anti-terror campaign .
In a conversation between Sam and Ministry of Information office Jack Lint , Lint reveals how he — as a key member of the internal security department  understands the events that are taking place :
SAM : You do n’t really think Tuttle and the girl are in league ?
JACK : I do .
Goodbye .
SAM : It could all be coincidental .
JACK : There are no coincidences , Sam .
Everything ’s connected , all along the line .
Cause and effect .
That ’s the beauty of it .
Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them .
This whole Buttle / Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside .
As the audience of the film , we know that the Tuttle / Buttle confusion was caused by a computer error within the department , and that " the girl " ( Jill Layton ) became involved as a concerned citizen trying to investigate a wrongful arrest .
The irony here is that a random chain of events kicked off by the Ministry 's own error is seen from inside ministry as further evidence of a terrorist conspiracy .
Revisionist historians have suggested that many wars and other events are staged or at least allowed to happen and then used by the government to manipulate public opinion in the direction that they want it to go .
Michael Ruppert has provided voluminous research suggesting that the US intelligence agencies had foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks and chose to allow them to occur , much the way that Roosevelt knew about Pearl Harbor and did not prevent it .
And there is the tradition of US enemies having once been funded by US intelligence agencies .
Bin Laden comes home to roost
His CIA ties are only the beginning of a woeful story By Michael Moran MSNBC
NEW YORK , Aug. 24 , 1998 
At the CIA , it happens often enough to have a code name : Blowback .
Simply defined , this is the term that describes an agent , an operative or an operation that has turned on its creators .
Osama bin Laden , our new public enemy Number 1 , is the personification of blowback .
And the fact that he is viewed as a hero by millions in the Islamic world proves again the old adage : Reap what you sow .
[…]
What the CIA bio conveniently fails to specify ( in its unclassified form , at least ) is that the MAK was nurtured by Pakistan 's state security services , the Inter - Services Intelligence agency , or ISI , the CIA 's primary conduit for conducting the covert war against Moscow 's occupation .
[…]
Yet the CIA , concerned about the factionalism of Afghanistan made famous by Rudyard Kipling , found that Arab zealots who flocked to aid the Afghans were easier to " read " than the rivalry - ridden natives .
While the Arab volunteers might well prove troublesome later , the agency reasoned , they at least were one - dimensionally anti-Soviet for now .
So bin Laden , along with a small group of Islamic militants from Egypt , Pakistan , Lebanon , Syria and Palestinian refugee camps all over the Middle East , became the " reliable " partners of the CIA in its war against Moscow .
Brazil shows a world of meek and helpless people , devoid of any artistic or aesthetic pleasure .
There are two heroes in the film :
Tuttle , the renegade heating repair engineer , and Jill Layton , a woman who takes it upon herself to fight the wrongful arrest of her neighbor 's husband .
The protagonist , Sam , is a happy cog in the great machine , content to waste away his life shuffling papers within a vast bureaucracy .
Social life is dominated by suspicion and fear .
And who is behind this ?
INTERVIEWER : Deputy minister , what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings ?
HELPMANN : Bad sportsmanship .
A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues .
They just ca n’t stand seeing the other fellow win .
If these people would just play the game , they 'd get a lot more out of life .
Compare this to President Bush ’s Address on Terrorism to Congress :
Americans are asking , ” Why do they hate us ? ”
They hate what they see right here in this chamber , a democratically elected government .
Their leaders are self - appointed .
They hate our freedoms , our freedom of religion , our freedom of speech , our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other .
The utter irony of this is that Bush and Helpmann depict terrorism as primarily a sort of arrested emotional development by those who did not learn in grade school to be good losers .
The little boy who took his ball and went home became a terrorist when he grew up .
This rhetorical tactic forestalls any inquiry into the religious or political movements that the terrorists might be seeking to advance or whether they have any real case against the American foreign policy .
An irony here is that the moral virtue claimed by both Bush and Helpmann is undermined by their own terror game .
The use of propaganda is another tactic used by totalitarian regimes to generate support for their program .
In Brazil as in Orwell 's 1984 , this takes the form of euphemisms .
KURTZMAN : I ’ve tried that !
Population Census have got him down as dormanted , the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted , and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative , Security has him down as excised , Admin have him down as completed .
SAM : Hang on …he's dead .
KURTZMANN : Dead ?
Besides being used to hide unpleasant meanings , euphemisms are also used to portray falsehood as truth .
The sinister internal security division is darkly named the Ministry of Information Retrieval .
They " retrieve " information from citizens by torture .
In a visual motif reminiscent of Soviet era propaganda , posters with banal slogans appear on buildings and in offices .
In case you can't read them all as they go by during the film , I have copied them from the excellent Brazil FAQ :
“ Be Safe : Be Suspicious ”
“ Suspicion Breeds Confidence ”
“ Trust in haste , Regret at leisure ”
“ Do n’t suspect a friend , report him ”
“ Who can you trust ? ”
This is not so different from modern America .
In case some American suspects a friend of theirs , Bush will make it possible for you to report him :
Operation TIPS Trips Up ? August 8 , 2002
( CBS ) In the aftermath of Sept. 11 , President Bush laid groundwork for “ Operation TIPS , " a program which would organize a volunteer army of citizen lookouts to report “ suspicious ” activities to the federal government .
Under “ Operation TIPS , " transportation workers , utility crews and letter carriers could sign up to snoop on members of their communities .
Attorney General Ashcroft argued such vigilance could thwart terrorists , CBS News Correspondent Bob Orr reports .
“ You have the ability of people who have a regular perception , who understand what ’s out of order here , what ’s different here , and maybe something needs to be looked into , ” Ashcroft said .
The plot of Brazil is driven by a series of accounting errors that are initiated when the Ministry of Information arrests and tortures the wrong man .
The arrest scene is a terrifying exhibition of police state tactics : several black - garbed troopers simultaneously burst through the walls and doors of the Buttle 's apartment .
They are followed a paper - pushing official who reads the banal statement of arrest to Mr. Buttle as he is about to be dragged off in a canvas sack and tortured to death :
OFFICIAL : I hereby inform you under powers entrusted to me under Section 47 , Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number 438476 , that Mr Buttle , Archibald , residing at 412 North Tower , Shangri La Towers , has been invited to assist the Ministry of Information with certain enquiries …
The accounting problems stem from the wrongful arrest of Mr. Buttle because they charge torture victims for the cost of their own torture .
These charges are necessary for efficiency , according to the Deputy Minister .
1
INTERVIEWER :
And the cost of it [ i.e. the Ministry 's campaign ] all , Deputy Minister ?
Seven percent of the gross national product …
HELPMANN : I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayers .
People want value for money .
And that 's why we always insist on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges .
It ’s absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention and the Information Retrieval Procedures used in their interrogation .
Later , when the Sam is arrested for a long list of crimes and brought back to Information Retrieval for processing , the Ministry even offers him a consumer financing plan to that they provide to help torture victims bear the cost :
OFFICIAL C : Now , either you plead guilty to say , seven or eight of these charges , which ’ll bring the costs down to within your reach , or you can borrow a sum to be negotiated , from us , at very competitive rates .
OFFICIAL D : We can offer you something at say , eleven and a half per cent , over thirty years .
But you will have to buy insurance to qualify for his scheme .
This type of plan brings to mind Paul Craig Roberts ' critique of current US judicial proceedings in which people are charged with a long list of related offences for a single crime then encouraged to plea bargain by pleading guilty to only one of them .
Also , compare Sam 's travails to a trial balloon that was floated by the Bush administration :
Officials consider tapping Iraqi oil to pay war costs
Some in Bush administration consider oil funds to be ‘ spoils of war ’
WASHINGTON  Bush administration officials are seriously considering proposals that the United States tap Iraq ’s oil to help pay the cost of a military occupation , a move that likely would prove highly inflammatory in an Arab world already suspicious of U.S. motives .
In another amazing parallel , the interior spaces of the rooms in Brazil are overrun with ugly meandering heating ducts .
And as US citizens we are told to stock up on duct tape .
How could a film produced fifteen years ago have foreseen these developments in such remarkable detail ?
Perhaps because they are not new : they are recurring patterns in the way that states use and manufacture the threat of warfare in order to control their own citizens .
State power tends to grow during wars because citizens become more willing to trade liberty for the security that states are willing to promise them .
But when a war ends , the pendulum swings back at least partially .
So why not manufacture a permanent state of war during which freedoms can be indefinitely suspended ?
Gilliam was writing history as well as foretelling the future .
By creatively retelling the past as a work of fiction about the future , he exposes the totalitarian impulse .
Note :
My own thoughts on this were augmented by points made in the FAQ , part 9 .

Psssst !
Wanna know a secret ?
How about a whole bunch of them ?
Sadly , the Colonel 's Secret Recipe and Dick Cheney 's Secure Undisclosed Location remain shrouded in mystery , but I 'm going to spill the beans about a bunch of things that technology companies would rather you did n't know .
These insider tips will help you cut through hype when you shop , save money when you buy , and get the most out of products you already own .
Your CPU May Be Much Faster Than You Think
Photograph : Rick Rizner
Here 's a CPU manufacturing secret : Most CPUs can be overclocked to run at least a bit faster than usual , giving your PC a free speed boost .
And on some rare occasions , low - end chips are capable of running just as fast as much more highly priced CPUs .
But while overclocking can speed up your system , note that you must take care to properly cool your PC , or you might damage the CPU -- and most system warranties wo n't cover that damage .
The big speed jumps usually come along when Intel or AMD has transitioned to a new manufacturing process and is getting great yields on even its high - end chips .
When that happens , slower CPUs that use the same technology are ripe for overclocking .
The classic example : Intel 's Celeron 300A chip , a 300 - MHz CPU that overclockers routinely ran at 450 MHz .
Check in periodically with enthusiast sites like Anandtech ( and HardOCP -- they go wild when those situations arise .
To overclock most of today 's CPUs , you bump up your computer 's bus speed , either through the system 's PC Setup ( or BIOS ) program or via a Windows - based utility such as NVidia 's NTune .
( See " Secret Tweaks " in our March 2005 issue . )
Each time you increase the speed , you should use a utility like Motherboard Monitor to check the CPU 's temperature while you stress the system by encoding video or playing a 3D game .
If the core temperature rises above 60 degrees centigrade , or if you experience any system instability ( crashes , corrupt graphics , etc. ) , roll back to the next - lowest setting and stay there .

Bill Gates may be the world 's richest man , but the technology he uses to do his job is probably not much different from yours ; perhaps you could n't afford his house , but you probably could afford his computers .
He uses a Dell PC running Windows XP Pro , with the standard Bliss ( rolling hills ) background , he answers his email in Outlook , and drinks Coke from the can .
What 's more , Gates 's office furniture looks like standard issue stuff for Microsoft programmers .
This is functional , but well below the levels of plushness enjoyed by senior executives even in much smaller companies .
Microsoft has always been utilitarian and egalitarian , having started next door to a launderette in Albuquerque .
Still , the sight of Bill 's workspace must have had jaws dropping all over corporate America .
The insight into Gates 's daily life came via a simple , self - penned piece , How I Work , in Fortune magazine ( www.tinyurl.com/qtpxs)
This revealed that Microsoft 's president and chief software architect uses a Dell with three 21in LCD screens , plus a few Motion Tablet PCs and a Logitech webcam .
If he could add something , it would be a digital whiteboard .
" I do n't have that right now , but probably I 'll get a digital whiteboard in the next year , " he writes .
Perhaps he 's saving up .
Having two or three LCDs is apparently common inside Microsoft , and Microsoft Research 's Mary Czerwinski studied the idea .
She found that having more screen area makes people more productive with windows - based operating systems - typically by 10 % , but it can be up to 44 % .
( Czerwinski 's results were based on comparing 15in and 42in screens . )
This could be an argument for buying a huge but expensive cinema - style display .
However , a few 19in or 21in LCDs provide more space for a lot less cost .
The main problem with expanding from two to three screens is often fitting them on an office desk .
As for Tablet PCs , Gates is one of the format 's biggest supporters .
The Tablet PC is synchronised with the desktop machine so Gates can take it to meetings , where writing on the screen is socially more acceptable than typing .
It also means his meeting notes - taken using OneNote software - are digital .
When it comes to software , it 's no surprise that Gates uses Microsoft products such as Outlook , OneNote , MSN Desktop Search , Live Communications Server ( which provides instant messaging , and works with the Microsoft , AOL and Yahoo public IM systems ) , and SharePoint .
The last two are part of the back - end support for Microsoft Office .
Rarely used in homes and small businesses , they are common enough in large businesses that use Microsoft 's server software .
SharePoint Services - a free download for Windows Server - is a collaboration system that has been described as a " wiki on steroids " .
The basic idea , says Microsoft , is to provide an intranet platform that enables teams to " work together on documents , tasks , contacts , events , and other information " .

Like most of us , Gates is at risk of " email overload " .
He writes : " I get about 100 emails a day .
We apply filtering to keep it to that level - email comes straight to me from anyone I 've ever corresponded with . "
The rest of the mail - probably thousands of messages a day - is sorted and summarised by assistants .
As Gates says : " We 're at the point now where the challenge is n't how to communicate effectively with email , it 's ensuring that you spend your time on the email that matters most . "
That 's a problem we all face , and today 's hardware and software can't do much about it .
I can imagine a mailrank algorithm that could do something like Google 's PageRank , and prioritise important mail .
Microsoft researchers are working on Snarf ( Social Network and Relationship Finder ) software to help with that .
Whether Google can get there first may be one thing Gates needs to think about .

A biologist studying wild songbirds in New York State has found that all 178 woodland birds he tested last year had unusually high levels of mercury in their blood and feathers , a sign that the toxic chemical has spread farther in the environment than previously thought .
The biologist , David C. Evers , who is also executive director of the Biodiversity Research Institute , a nonprofit ecological organization in Gorham , Me. , said that his preliminary findings challenged existing perceptions about how far mercury travels , how it interacts with the environment and how it affects various forms of wildlife — all with worrisome implications for people .
While mercury has often been found in lakes and streams and in fish , Dr. Evers ’s work documents the unexpected presence of the chemical in birds that do not live on water and never eat fish .
“ Impacts on biological diversity usually show impacts on human health , ” Dr. Evers said in a telephone interview .
“ If these birds are having trouble , that should be a very good indicator of a risk to our own well - being and health as well . ”
Mirror Your Web Site With rsync
This tutorial shows how you can mirror your web site from your main web server to a backup server that can take over if the main server fails .
We use the tool rsync for this , and we make it run through a cron job that checks every x minutes if there is something to update on the mirror .
Thus your backup server should usually be up to date if it has to take over .
rsync updates only files that have changed , so you do not need to transfer 5 GB of data whenever you run rsync .
It only mirrors new / changed files , and it can also delete files from the mirror that have been deleted on the main server .
In addition to that it can preserve permissions and ownerships of mirrored files and directories ; to preserve the ownerships , we need to run rsync as root which is what we do here .
If permissions and / or ownerships change on the main server , rsync will also change them on the backup server .
In this tutorial we will tunnel rsync through SSH which is more secure ; it also means you do not have to open another port in your firewall for rsync - it is enough if port 22 ( SSH ) is open .
The problem is that SSH requires a password for logging in which is not good if you want to run rsync as a cron job .
The need for a password requires human interaction which is not what we want .
But fortunately there is a solution : the use of public keys .
We create a pair of keys ( on our backup server mirror.example.com ) , one of which is saved in a file on the remote system ( server1.example.com ) .
Afterwards we will not be prompted for a password anymore when we run rsync .
This also includes cron jobs which is exactly what we want .
As you might have guessed already from what I have written so far , the concept is that we initiate the mirroring of server1.example.com directly from mirror.example.com ; server1.example.com does not have to do anything to get mirrored .
I will use the following setup here :
Main server : server1.example.com ( server1 ) - IP address : 192.168.0.100
( ) - IP address : Mirror / backup server : mirror.example.com ( mirror ) - IP address : 192.168.0.175
( ) - IP address :
The web site that is to be mirrored is in / var / www on server1.example.com .
rsync is for mirroring files and directories only ; if you want to mirror your MySQL database , then use MySQL mirroring / replication instead .
I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
1 Install rsync
First , we have to install rsync on both server1.example.com and mirror.example.com .
For Debian and Ubuntu systems , this looks like this :
server1 / mirror :
( We do this as root ! )
apt - get install rsync
On other Linux distributions , you would use yum ( Fedora / CentOS ) or yast ( SuSE ) to install rsync .
2 Create An Unprivileged User On server1.example.com
Now we create an unprivileged user called someuser on server1.example.com that will be used by rsync on mirror.example.com to mirror the directory / var / www ( of course , someuser must have read permissions on / var / www on server1.example.com ) .
server1 :
( We do this as root ! )
useradd -d / home / someuser -m -s / bin / bash someuser
This will create the user someuser with the home directory / home / someuser and the login shell / bin / bash ( it is important that someuser has a valid login shell - something like / bin / false does not work ! ) .
Now give someuser a password :
passwd someuser
3 Test rsync
Next , we test rsync on mirror.example.com .
As root we do this :
mirror :
You should see something like this .
Answer with yes :
The authenticity of host ' server1.example.com ( 192.168.0.100 ) ' can't be established .
RSA key fingerprint is 32:e5:79:8e:5f:5a:25:a9 :f1:0d:ef:be:5b:a6:a6:23 .
Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes / no ) ?
<-- yes
Then enter someuser 's password , and you should see that server1.example.com 's / var / www directory is mirrored to /var / www on mirror.example.com .
Advertisement
You can check that like this on both servers :
server1 / mirror :
ls - la / var / www
You should see that all files and directories have been mirrored to mirror .
example.com , and the files and directories should have the same permissions / ownerships as on server1.example.com .
4 Create The Keys On mirror.example.com
Now we create the private / public key pair on mirror.example.com :
mirror : Advertisement
( We do this as root ! )
mkdir /root / rsync
ssh - keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -f /root / rsync/mirror- rsync-key
You will see something like this :
Generating public / private dsa key pair .
Enter passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : [ press enter here ]
Enter same passphrase again : [ press enter here ]
Your identification has been saved in / root / cron / mirror - rsync -key .
Your public key has been saved in /root / cron/mirror - rsync - key.pub .
The key fingerprint is :
68:95:35:44:91:f1:45:a4:af:3f:69:2a:ea:c5:4e:d7 [ email protected ]
It is important that you do not enter a passphrase otherwise the mirroring will not work without human interaction so simply hit enter !
Next , we copy our public key to server1.example.com :
mirror :
( Still , we do this as root . )
The public key mirror - rsync - key .pub should now be available in /home / someuser on server1.example.com .
5 Configure server1.example.com
Now log in through SSH on server1.example.com as someuser ( not root ! ) and do this :
server1 :
( Please do this as someuser ! )
Advertisement
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
mv ~/mirror-rsync-key.pub ~/.ssh /
cd ~/.ssh
touch authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
cat mirror-rsync-key.pub >> authorized_keys
By doing this , we have appended the contents of mirror - rsync - key.pub to the file / home / someuser/.ssh/authorized_keys .
/home/someuser/.ssh/authorized_keys should look similar to this :
server1 :
( Still as someuser ! )
vi /home / someuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
Now we want to allow connections only from mirror .
example.com , and the connecting user should be allowed to use only rsync , so we add
command= " /home/someuser/rsync/checkrsync " , from=" mirror.example.com " , no - port - forwarding , no - X11 - forwarding , no - pty
right at the beginning of /home / someuser/.ssh/authorized_keys :
server1 :
( Still as someuser ! )
vi /home / someuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
It is important that you use a FQDN like mirror .
example.com instead of an IP address after from= , otherwise the automated mirroring will not work !
Now we create the script / home / someuser / rsync / checkrsync that rejects all commands except rsync .
server1 :
( We still do this as someuser ! )
mkdir ~/rsync
vi ~/rsync / checkrsync
#!/bin/sh
case " $ SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND " in
*\&*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
*\(*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
*\{*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
*\;*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
*\<*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
*\`*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
rsync\ -- server *)
$ SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
; ;
*)
echo " Rejected "
; ;
esac
chmod 700 ~/rsync/checkrsync
6 Test rsync On mirror.example.com
Now we must test on mirror.example.com if we can mirror server1.example.com without being prompted for someuser 's password .
We do this :
mirror :
( We do this as root ! )
( The -- delete option means that files that have been deleted on server1.example.com should also be deleted on mirror.example.com .
The -- exclude option means that these files / directories should not be mirrored ; e.g. -- exclude= **/ error means " do not mirror / var / www / error " .
You can use multiple -- exclude options .
I have listed these options as examples ; you can adjust the command to your needs .
Have a look at
man rsync
for more information . )
You should now see that the mirroring takes place :
receiving file list ... done
sent 71 bytes received 643 bytes 476.00 bytes/sec
total size is 64657 speedup is 90.56
without being prompted for a password !
This is what we wanted .
7 Create A Cron Job
We want to automate the mirroring , that is why we create a cron job for it on mirror.example.com .
Run crontab -e as root :
mirror :
( We do this as root ! )
crontab -e
and create a cron job like this : Advertisement
This would run rsync every 5 minutes ; adjust it to your needs ( see
man 5 crontab
) .
I use the full path to rsync here ( /usr/ bin/rsync ) just to go sure that cron knows where to find rsync .
Your rsync location might differ .
Run
mirror :
( We do this as root ! )
which rsync
to find out where yours is .
The " digital divide " refers to the fact that certain parts of the population have substantially better opportunities to benefit from the new economy than other parts of the population .
Most commentators view this in purely economic terms .
However , two other types of divide will have much greater impact in the years to come .
Stage 1 : Economic Divide
In its simplest form , the digital divide is manifested in the fact that some people can't afford to buy a computer .
Although politicians always talk about this point , it 's growing more irrelevant with each passing day — at least in the industrialized world .
We should recognize that for truly poor developing countries , computers will remain out of the average citizen 's reach for 20 years or more .
In areas like North America , Europe , Australia , and Asia 's advanced countries , computer cost is no longer an issue .
Dell 's cheapest computer costs $ 379 ( with a monitor ) and is about 500 times as powerful as the Macintosh Plus I used to write my Ph.D. thesis .
While it 's true that a few people can't even afford $ 379 , in another five years , computers will be one - fourth their current price .
Would that all social problems would go away if we simply waited five years .
Stage 2 : Usability Divide
Far worse than the economic divide is the fact that technology remains so complicated that many people could n't use a computer even if they got one for free .
Many others can use computers , but do n't achieve the modern world 's full benefits because most of the available services are too difficult for them to understand .
Almost 40 % of the population has lower literacy skills , and yet few websites follow the guidelines for writing for low - literacy users .
Even government sites that target poorer citizens are usually written at a level that requires a university degree to comprehend .
The British government has done some good work on simplifying much of its direct .
gov.uk site information , but even it requires at least a high school education to easily read .
Lower literacy is the Web 's biggest accessibility problem , but nobody cares about this massive user group .
Senior citizens face the second - biggest accessibility problem , but again there is little interest in the guidelines for making websites easier for older users .
Companies do n't even have the excuse that it does n't pay to cater to this audience , because retirees are rich these days .
Even though seniors are the main remaining source of growth in Internet use , companies are still endlessly fascinated by young users and ignore older , richer users who would be much more loyal customers -- if only someone bothered to sell to them .
Whereas the economic divide is closing rapidly , I see little progress on the usability divide .
Usability is improving for higher - end users .
For this group , websites get easier every year , generating vast profits for site owners .
Because they now follow more e-commerce user experience guidelines , companies that sell online typically have conversion rates of around 2 % , which is twice the conversion rate of the bubble years .
That 's all great news for high - end users , but the less - skilled 40 % of users have seen little in the way of usability improvement .
We know how to help these users — we 're simply not doing it .
Stage 3 : Empowerment Divide
We have the knowledge needed to close the usability divide , and I remain hopeful that we 'll get the job done .
The empowerment divide , however , is the hard one : even if computers and the Internet were extraordinarily easy to use , not everybody would make full use of the opportunities that such technology affords .
Participation inequality is one exponent of the empowerment divide that has held constant throughout all the years of Internet growth : in social networks and community systems , about 90 % of users do n't contribute , 9 % contribute sporadically , and a tiny minority of 1 % accounts for most contributions .
In researching how people use search engines for my seminar on Top Web UX Design Guidelines , we 've found that many users do n't know how to use search to truly master the Web .
People do n't understand advanced search features , they rarely employ query reformulation , and many uncritically select the first search results .
Also , many users do n't understand how search engines prioritize their listings , and some users do n't even know that the euphemistic label " sponsored links " refers to paid advertisements .
( For more info , see Consumer Reports ' study of what users know about search ads . )
Because they lack the initiative and skill to take matters into their own hands , some users remain at the mercy of other people 's decisions .
For example , people sometimes accept the default home page chosen by their computer vendor or ISP rather than select one that 's better suited to their needs .
Again , this means that the user 's attention can be sold off like a sheep to slaughter , as indicated by deals where search engines pay computer vendors millions of dollars to be the default setting on shipping PCs .
Similarly , some users limit themselves to " free " Web applications that display ads .
What such users do n't realize is that better applications ( more appropriate , powerful , and liberating ones ) are available at a cost that 's far less than the value of the time they waste trying not to look at the ads .
Prospects for Bridge Building
The Internet can be an empowering tool that lets people find good deals , manage vendors , and control their finances and investments .
But it can just as easily be an alienating environment where people are cheated .
Members of the Internet elite do n't realize the extent to which less - skilled users are left out of many of the advancements they cheer and enjoy .
Ultimately , I 'm extremely optimistic about the economic divide , which is vanishing rapidly in industrialized countries .
The usability divide will take longer to close , but at least we know how to handle it — it 's simply a matter of deciding to do so .
I 'm very pessimistic about the empowerment divide , however , which I expect will only grow more severe in the future .
Gonzales ' sacking of US Attorneys like a ' coup d'etat ' Michael Roston
Published : Friday February 9 , 2007 Print This Email This A columnist at Salon has described Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' sacking of United States Attorneys involved in controversial prosecutions as an act that amounts to a " coup d'etat . "
Joe Conason highlights the removal from office of Carol Lam , Bud Cummings , and John McKay , U.S. Attorneys in San Diego , Little Rock , and Seattle respectively , whose prosecutions ran against the partisan interests of the Bush White House .
These acts , Conason writes , suggest that " the White House and the Justice Department have been exposed in a secretive attempt to expand executive power for partisan purposes . "
The ability of the White House to swap out U.S. Attorneys with partisan appointees resulted when the staff of Senator Arlen Specter inserted a measure in the renewal of the USA Patriot Act that " permitted the White House to place its own appointees in vacant U.S. attorney positions permanently and without Senate confirmation . "
According to Conason , Specter says he was not aware of the action by a member of his staff .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is working to restore the US Attorney appointment system to its earlier nonpartisan status .
Conason hopes that they will go further in their response .
" The Senate Democrats should continue to probe the attorney general 's little coup d'état and all of the resulting appointments .
That is the best way to discourage future usurpations -- and to frustrate whatever skulduggery was afoot this time , " he writes .
The full column can be read by watching an advertisement at Salon 's website .
My recent video , which tweaked Microsoft for crowing about its “ innovation ” in Windows Vista ( without acknowledging its huge debt to Mac OS X ) , triggered plenty of reaction .
It probably comes as no surprise that your comments quickly devolved into “ which is better ” bickering , which will proably never end .
Some of you claim , with much anger and swearing , that Apple steals from Microsoft just as much as the other way .
My response to one such response : “ You ’re right–very few things were actually invented wholesale by Apple .
The mouse , menus , overlapping windows , the CD drive , Wi-Fi wireless , and so on–all of these things were developed elsewhere .
“ But Apple * standardized * them .
Chose them , recognized their potential , perfected them , made them over in its own way , and brought them to the masses .
“ In Vista , on the other hand , Microsoft did not select unrecognized features , did not have any particular vision in knowing what would work and what would n’t , did not put its own stamp on anything .
It simply waited for Apple to recognize and perfect good technologies , then duplicated them bit for bit .
Oh , and then claim to be a leader in innovation .
That ’s quite a difference ! ”
Then this e-mail message , which arrived today from a guy who says he worked as a Microsoft temp employee from 2003 to 2004 .
I ’ve agreed not to publish his name .
“ Dear David :
In your article on December 14 , 2006 , you stated : ‘ You get the feeling that Microsoft ’s managers put Mac OS X on an easel and told the programmers , ‘ Copy that . ’
“ [ When I worked at Microsoft , ] I was given a badge that allowed me entry to all but a few of the Microsoft buildings .
One of the things that caught my eye was a large grid on the wall of a hallway in the building that housed the engineers that worked on Windows Media Player — building 50 , on the 2nd or 3rd floor .
“ The grid was labeled across the top with A , B , C , etc. , and down the left with 1,2,3 , like a game of Battleship .
The grid was made of 8.5×11 - inch pages , landscape orientation , showing color screenshots from Apple ’s iTunes software .
Each sheet was a different screen of the application : each tab of a preference panel , each info window , everything .
“ Around the corner was another grid , showing the RealPlayer application .
This grid was the same : grid A1 was the front user view of the application , mirroring what was on the iTunes wall / grid .
“ Around the next corner was * another * grid , this one showing Windows Media Player version 9 !!
This one was missing a few tiles in the grid , but you could actually see the progress as each feature [ of iTunes and RealPlayer ] was copied , square for square .
“ Amazing .
New software is put out , a manager sees it and decides that the creative part of their day is making color screen captures of the software and presenting it to the copying —er , engineering team . ”
I doubt you ’ll have any reactions to THIS ( evil grin ) , but thought I ’d share it with you just the same .
Could it be legit ?
Or are we being put on by yet another fanner of the flames ?

( CNN ) -- Forget big metal birds of steel , the aircraft of the future will be constructed out of non-metal materials .
That is according to American plane - maker Boeing which says new technology will soon enable us to take flights in carriers largely constructed from materials called composites .
Alan Mulally , president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes , said the company was looking to replace existing 737 models with the new materials .
A composite is formed when two or more materials with very different properties are combined together .
They are already used in items such as tennis rackets and bicycle spokes .
Boeing 's new 787 - Dreamliner is built from composites and will set a precedent for future Boeing models , Britain 's Press Association reported ahead of the Farnborough Air Show , held in England this week and one of the biggest events on the aviation calendar .
The 787 is expected to make its first flight in mid-2007 and deliver the first models to customers in 2008 .
The aircraft is made from a combination of non-metal carbon fiber composite materials , which is lighter than the aluminum normally used .
This reduces the weight of the aircraft and leads to better fuel efficiency .
Boeing predicts the 787s will be 20 percent more efficient than its 767 planes .
" All future planes will be made out of composites because it does n't fatigue and it does n't corrode , " Mulally said .
He said composite material would be used to build up to 50 percent of each aircraft and would significantly reduce the cost of building and maintaining them .
Mulally predicted that the technology needed to build the new Boeing 737s would not be ready until the middle of the next decade .
" What 's absolutely key is getting our technology to a position where it 's right to do this , " he said .
Mulally also said that , like rival Airbus , the company was experiencing supply problems and the weight of the 787 had exceeded its target , although he would n't elaborate on how much .
" We 're a little over where we want to be at this time on weight , but ahead of where we were on previous programs , so we 're really focused on weight - efficient structure right now , " he told Associated Press .
Boeing has had 360 firm orders for the new 787 .
Airbus was expected to make an announcement on Monday about revamping the design of its middle - weight plane , the A350 , at the Farnborough Airshow .

Haiku and Senryu
Below is an informative guide to writing Haiku and Senryu by Kathy Lippard Cobb including : Definition of Haiku , Helpful Hints , Juxtaposition in Haiku , Definition of Senryu , The Difference Between Haiku and Senryu , and also featured is a section on Tanka ( above ) by Kathy as well with informative links .
Definition of Haiku
1 ) An unrhymed Japanese poem recording the essence of a moment .
Nature is combined with human nature .
It usually consists of three lines of 5/7/5 ( 5 kana in the first line , 7 kana in the second line , and 5 kana in the third line ) totaling seventeen kana .
2 ) A foreign adaptation of 1 , usually written in three lines totaling 17 syllables or LESS .
As you will notice , there are two definitions .
Definition # 1 is where many get confused .
People tend to confuse kana or a single unit in the Japanese language with the English syllable .
This is like comparing apples to oranges .
Kana can not be compared to syllables .
Unless you are Japanese , have been writing Japanese , or speak fluent Japanese , you will be writing definition # 2 .
The difference between the two is that in definition # 2 , you will be writing three lines of poetry , 17 syllables or LESS .
This means you do not have to write three lines of 5/7/5 ( 5 syllables in the first line , 7 syllables in the second line , and 5 syllables in the third line ) .
You may do so , if you can do it well without fluff words ( many can 't ) .
If you write 5 / 7/5 , that does not make your poem more of a haiku than someone who does not write 5/7/5 .
An ideal haiku should be short / long / short - but that depends on the haiku itself .
There is nothing wrong with 5 /7/5 , if that is what you want to write .
However , the majority of modern haiku in most of the journals are not 5 /7/ 5 .
That does n't mean that it does n't have its place .
However , it is all " haiku , " not " haiku " and " other . "
It 's just haiku .
If you like , you can refer to 5/7/5 as " traditional " -- but even that is not entirely accurate , as it is quickly becoming more traditional to veer away from 5 / 7/ 5 .
The plural of haiku is also haiku , NOT haikus .
After you have been writing and studying haiku for a while , you may be ready to break a rule .
This is fine , if it is needed to improve the quality of an individual haiku .
However , before breaking any haiku rule , you must learn and practice the rules .
Then after you are more experienced , you can determine which rule , if any , you want to break on occasion .
Break rules out of experience , not inexperience .

Helpful Hints
1 ) Haiku is generally not written in one long run on sentence .
It is generally written in two parts .
You have a fragment on the first or the last line , then you have the body of the haiku .
Example :
winter sun --
a cyclist pedals
against the wind
Copyright © 2000 Kathy Lippard Cobb , April 2001 Heron's Nest
or like this :
a cyclist pedals
against the wind --
winter sun
A good structure for beginning haiku poets is :
setting
subject and action ( on two lines )
2 ) Haiku is not written in the past , nor does it cover a long period of time .
It is in the moment .
It is about taking ordinary moments , and making them extraordinary .
3 ) Haiku usually contains a season word ( called kigo ) .
It is not a requirement , but season words are a big part of haiku .
However , it 's best to avoid dual or conflicting kigo .
Do not fill your haiku with them .
Haiku is a short poem , and must contain some substance .
It should not be just a weather report .
There are occasions once you are more experienced , that you may have two kigo in one haiku , however , one should clearly be the main kigo and not be redundant .
You only have dual kigo , if they enhance the haiku .
Example of dual kigo that are redundant :
Christmas Eve--
my daughter 's note for Santa
under the cookies
Anyone knows that if the daughter left a note or cookies for Santa , that it must be Christmas Eve .
So it would be better to use something else for line 1 - Christmas Eve is not needed .
You can find kigo lists online or buy books that contain them .
Please see the links section for a free kigo list .
4 ) Haiku is usually not written in three sentence fragments .
There is usually one fragment and a phrase on the other two lines .
5 ) Haiku does not use metaphor , personification , simile , or many other poetic devices so popular in other forms of poetry .
It is about the essence of a moment , stated simply .
6 ) The majority of haiku do not use capitalization and use minimal punctuation ( though you may see a few who do this ) .
Periods are not used , and the only thing capitalized are months or holidays .
However , many do not capitalize anything .
Periods close in the haiku , so are to be avoided .
Haiku should left open ended , almost unfinished .
7 ) Avoid " so what " moments .
These are haiku that are stated so simply that they 're boring .
I call this grocery list haiku .
Example :
winter afternoon --
I walk to the store
and back again
There is such a thing as stating things too simply .
However , the poetics in haiku is not due to flowery language , it 's using juxtaposition between the two parts to create resonance .
However , if not using juxtaposition , the haiku must contain something to capture the reader 's interest , let the reader see what the author was seeing at the time , but through the reader 's own eyes .
Yes , you can do this .
Things simply stated can still be interesting .
8 ) Avoid photo haiku -- haiku that are nothing more than snapshots , do not focus on a specific moment or image , and have no real resonance or action .
Example :
crowded pub --
cocktail glasses line
the corner of the bar
It 's not only boring , but it 's too common of an image .
It is not focusing on one specific moment .
This is just an overall picture in a bar , it does n't really say anything .
It 's just a " so what " moment that occurs in every bar in the world .
You can make this more interesting , by focusing on something specific or a specific person .
Example :
happy hour --
a redhead scrawls her name
in the window frost
Here I even worked in a season word , " frost . "
I focused on one person , not the entire bar .
9 ) Avoid cause and effect in haiku -- where something in one part of the haiku causes action in the second part .
Example :
heavy rain --
my shirt clings
to my body
It 's not only boring , it 's too obvious .
You can have cause and effect , IF it 's contained in one part of the haiku .
Example :
a leaf spirals
in the summer wind --
his good - bye letter
This kind of cause and effect is o.k. , as it 's contained in one part of the haiku .
Then , you can add something else for the third line , such as I did here .
I used a good - bye letter to juxtapose with the leaf .
These are two very lonely images .
You can add whatever you like in the third line .
Do n't tell the reader they should feel lonely , show it .
There ARE haiku that have cause and effect , where something in the first part of the haiku , causes action in the second half .
However , usually , there is another level of meaning present .
It 's not just simple cause and effect , as in my " heavy rain " example .
10 ) Show do n't tell .
This is confusing to many writers .
It certainly was to me .
We all know that the English language , or ANY language , TELLS .
I have never heard of a " story shower . "
However , what it means to show do n't tell , is that instead of saying that you are sad , lonely , or that you love someone , try to show it .
Instead of telling your emotions , show it by using concrete imagery .
Example of telling :
the funeral over --
the house is so lonely
without him
Example of showing :
the funeral over --
his aftershave lingers
in our bedroom
This shows loneliness .
However , the phrase " I 'm lonely " is nowhere in this poem .
This is just one of many examples of show do n't tell .

Juxtaposition in Haiku
One of the other tools that help to write effective haiku is juxtaposition .
This may be a new term for some of you .
For those who are familiar with this term , you are a step ahead of the game .
Juxtaposition is the act of placing two images side by side .
They can be very different images for a contrast , or they can seemingly have nothing in common , but upon closer reflection , have things in common .
If you effectively juxtapose two images , the poem resonates .
However , if you do n't get the juxtaposition in many haiku at first , that is o.k .
The best method to gain understanding of juxtaposition , is to read a lot of haiku .
Sooner or later , haiku that you did n't understand in the beginning , will be easily understandable later .
Example of juxtaposition :
rain fills
the deflated basketball --
our last good - bye
Copyright © 2001 Kathy Lippard Cobb , Starfish Summer 2001
Upon looking at this , you may think that a basketball and two lovers saying good - bye may have nothing in common .
However , rain filling something that was once full , round , and used for entertainment , is a very lonely image .
Now the basketball is a sad , deflated version of what it used to be .
Just as two lovers who are saying good - bye for the last time , imply that there was a time when things were romantic and magical .
Now they are saying good - bye , which could only mean that the magic is gone .
Haiku takes awhile to learn .
It is not easy , it takes patience .
Once you get more experience , you will learn to read between the two juxtaposed parts .
Whether you always get the juxtaposition or not , you can still enjoy the haiku as a whole .
It can still stand alone .
However , once you are experienced , you will be able to read between the two parts of the haiku for an added bonus .
A good analogy is Cracker Jacks .
You like them , because they taste good .
However , when you find the prize at the bottom of the box , it 's an added pleasure .
However , not all haiku have juxtaposed images .
These are called " sketch of life , " and are a perfectly respectable form of haiku .
Juxtaposition is one of many tools at your disposal , a POWERFUL one , but only one .
Haiku is not just poetry , it 's a way of life .
You will find yourself focusing on specific moments , and writing down phrases to remember later .
It makes you appreciate the small things .
You may want to join a list , there are some good ones on the links page .
Shiki workshop , shiki-temp , and WHC Beginners are all good lists for budding haiku poets .
There are many veteran haiku poets , that will be more than happy to give you all of the help you need .
There is also a link to an exercise to learn how to write haiku .
I used it , and it really helped me understand a lot about this form .

Definition of Senryu
1 ) A Japanese poem similar in structure to haiku , but more concerned with human nature , and is often humorous or satiric -- usually in three lines of seventeen kana .
2 ) A foreign adaptation of 1 , usually written in three lines of 17 syllables or LESS .
Again , unless you are Japanese , have been writing Japanese , or speak fluent Japanese , you will be writing definition # 2 .
A good structure for beginning senryu poets is :
setting
subject and action ( on two lines )

The Difference Between Haiku and Senryu
The primary difference between haiku and senryu is the tone .
Senryu is much more concerned with human nature , political issues , and satiric humor ( making fun of things ) .
There is a big debate over what is or is not senryu .
You will see many haiku in the senryu section of many journals or vice versa .
Many poets just submit their haiku / senryu , and let the editor decide where it needs to be placed in their magazine , the haiku section or the senryu section .
There are views that all nature is haiku and all human nature is senryu .
Many journals consider some all human nature poems " haiku . "
However , the majority of haiku combine both human nature and nature .
The major difference between haiku and senryu is the tone .
They are similar in construction .
This is senryu :
men o pause . . .
the men suck in their guts
as a blonde walks by
Copyright © 2001 Kathy Lippard Cobb
This poem is all human nature , and is making fun of a group of people
The men o pause is a play on the word " menopause . "
Basically , men pause when the blonde walks by .
Menopause is about the hormonal changes women go through .
However , this shows how men behave during their own mid-life crisis .

Introduction
MacBook
Manufacturer : Apple ( product page )
Quick specs : Intel Core Duo T2500 CPU , 512MB RAM , 60 GB hard drive , Intel GMA950 graphics
Price as configured : US $ 1,299 ( shop for this item )
We all knew it was coming and we had a pretty good idea about what form it would be arriving in .
The announcement was supposedly delayed for a week , and the tension building up to its actual release was thick despite the overwhelming amount of information readily available , albeit rumored , on certain websites .
Once the MacBook was announced , Apple shut the door on PowerPC portable computers , completing a chapter of the transition to its Intel - powered future .
On May 16 , the MacBook replaced the nearly seven - year - old iBook and brought with it a new era of consumer - grade portables from Apple .
For the first time since the clam - shell style iBooks were discontinued at the beginning of 2001 is an Apple portable available in more than one color .
Apple has been toying with the idea of offering both black and white devices since the iPod nano and subsequently the video - capable iPod , and now they 've begun offering their consumer - grade portable laptop , the predictably named MacBook , in similar glossy black and white models .
As configured by Apple , there are three models of MacBook to choose from .
The cheapest , and least powerful model is nearly as capable as the original MacBook Pros ( they received their own incremental upgrades this week as well ) .
An Intel Core Duo T2400 processor ( 1.83GHz ) powers this base model , and a 2.0 GHz T2500 processor sits inside the other two .
Unfortunately for lovers of glossy black Apple stuff , only the most powerful and expensive MacBook model is available in ebony .
The specifications of the three base models can be seen below :
White 1.8 White 2.0 Black 2.0 Processor Intel Core Duo T2400 ( 1.83GHz ) Intel Core Duo T2500 ( 2.0GHz ) Memory 512MB PC2-5300 DDR2
Hard drive 60 GB SATA @ 5400rpm 80 GB SATA @ 5400rpm Front - side bus 667MHz Graphics Intel GMA950 , 64MB Optical drive Combo Drive ( CD- RW/DVD- ROM ) SuperDrive ( DVD±RW/CD-RW )
Looking down at the MacBook from on high Looking down at the MacBook from on high
As our astute readers have probably already realized , there is scant difference between the low - and high - end models of MacBook .
Actually , the only differences are very slight variations in CPU , optical drive , and hard disk space .
This has caused several questions to be raised about the pricing of the models , which are US $ 1,099 , US $ 1,299 , and $ 1,499 in respect to the figure above .
An oft - bandied - about factoid is that if you were to configure the midlevel model to ship with an 80 GB hard disk to match the high - end model , you 'd still notice that it 's approximately US $ 150 cheaper .
The only difference is the color and finish of the shell , of course ( white is glossy and the black has a matte finish ) .
This is undoubtedly done on purpose and is the direct result of Apple 's experience selling iPod and iPod nanos in two color options .
It did n't take long for Apple , and casual observers of Apple 's operations to notice that the black models were selling out faster .
A lot faster .
Obviously the demand for black Apple products is much higher than the white products , and Apple is simply responding as most companies would when faced by high demand for a product .
People who are set on getting that black MacBook are going to have to wrestle with the US $ 150 mark - up .
Apple is banking that most people will willingly hand over even more cash to get a unique item .
It sucks for people without the extra moolah to blow , but it does n't take long to come to the realization that it 's just a different color and that you 're going to be saving a nice chunk of change by going with white .
It 's up to you to decide whether black is worth US $ 150 .

ごぶさたしてました。なんとか、復帰しました。休日をすべてベッドの中で過ごしました（なんかもったいない気分）。しか〜し、もう迷わない、止まらない。走る〜、走る〜、俺たち〜、わっしょい。
というわけで、今日は、いきなりウィンドウ移動の高速化をやった。実は、前々から、コンソールウィンドウを移動させるときに「やけに遅いなぁ」とは思っていたのだが、ここにきて、これを修正するのか…。お…、俺の心を読んだのか…、なかなかやるな川合氏。というわけで、さっそく試してみる。ちなみに、基本的に俺は動作確認をQEMU上でしか試さないため（しかもロースペックなＰＣなため）、かなりウィンドウ移動が遅くなっていた。が、sheet_refreshmap関数の改良と、sheet_refreshsub関数の改良はかなりナイスだ！
ただ、１バイト単位でコピーしていたものを４バイト単位にしただけでこれほどまでに違いが現れるとは…。この辺はいろんな意味で、「アルゴリズムって大事だなー」と思わせるヒトトキだった。
次に複数のコンソールを出したり、また、コンソール自体を消したりする処理などを追加したのだが、個人的にはこれはもっと早くに扱って欲しかった内容だった。だって、たくさんの真っ黒い画面があって、それらに読みきれないほどの文字が、だーーーーって流れているのが、なんかハッカーって感じでカッコイイ。俺の中では「真っ黒い画面＝ハッカー」だから、もう真っ黒い画面がいっぱいあったらスーパーハッカー。dirばっかり入力しててもスーパーハッカー。そもそもハッカーって悪い人って意味じゃないみたいだけど、そんなんどうでもよくて、真っ黒い画面はスーパーハッカー（って、技術者のかざかみにも置けんヤツだなぁ）。何はともあれたくさんの真っ黒い画面が俺は欲しいんだ。それで、たくさんの真っ黒い画面を出すんなら、当然消すこともできたい。だからそれらも実装！
この辺りになってくると、もう完全にＯＳとしての機能を強化することに集中している感じだ。もうCPUだのPICだの16ビットだの32ビットだのというワケワカラン世界とは別世界だ。ある意味、普通にプログラミングを楽しむことができる期間だといえる。
ゴールまであと４ 日 乞うご期待。
Noiseless and tailless bat - looking passenger liner designed
A team of 40 engineers from the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has unveiled a design for the concept plane SAX - 40 , a “ silent aircraft . ”
The design is the result of three years ’ work .
The aircraft ’s key design features look stunning , particularly to those who are completely unaware of any mysteries relating to aerodynamics .
The concept is what is known as a Blended Wing Body design .
The aircraft ’s flattened and tailless body resembles the shape of a bat .
The noise produced by the craft while cruising would stay within the range of noise caused by a washing machine , Reuter ’s reports .
Noiseless and tailless bat - looking passenger liner designed
“ The radical design of a new passenger aircraft has been unveiled .
The aircraft ’s technical characteristics are unlikely to look impressive to you if you ’re not an aviation buff , ” said Academician Valentin Belokon , an expert in aerodynamics with Tsiolkovsky Academy of Cosmonautics .
“ The aircraft weighs 150 tons ; it takes off at about 900 km/h carrying 215 passengers .
Well , there ’s nothing special about the above features .
The flight range is around 9,500 km , this one looks pretty extensive , ” added Belokon .
So what is so radical about the design of the new plane ?
First and foremost , the SAX - 40 can improve fuel economy by 35 % compared with the most fuel - efficient contemporary airliner .
The new aircraft seems to have good prospects for becoming a savior of the civil aviation , especially if airlines should pay the “ green tax ” on emissions of their planes .
“ This outstanding fuel efficiency is undoubtedly the result of a most original approach in terms of design , ” said Belokon .
“ The SAX - 40 is the first passenger aircraft of a hybrid design that uses the wings of a conventional plane smoothly blended into a wide tailless body .
As a rule , it takes a lot of effort to come up with this sort of concept design features .
No doubts about it , the huge progress in the use of supercomputers helped the designers to complete the job faster than expected .
The design of a plane is not based on prefab formulas , in this case it ’s mostly a matter of art coupled with the power of computer experimentation , ” said Belokon .
The joint British - American team took just three years to design an aircraft with the unusually high fuel - efficiency characteristics , which by 30 % exceed those of the Boeing 787 , the most economical airliner to date though it is still in the works .
It took about 7 years to develop the supersonic Concord .
The design of the giant double - decker Airbus A380 took 13 years to complete .
“ We do have an intrigue in this case , ” said Belokon .
“ The new craft is a symbiosis of two ideologies , namely the sickle - like wing concept designed by the German company ARADO back in 1944 , and design features used in our fighters Su - 27 through Su - 34 , which marked an important step in the blending of wings into a fuselage ( the above aircraft developed from 1969 to 1981 ) .
The SAX - 40 is askillful adaptation of these ideas .
Therefore , it ’s a lot clearer now to imagine how a relatively small team 40 strong managed to come up with such a radical aircraft design , ” said Belokon .
According to our expert , the sophisticated integration of wings into a fuselage enabled the designers to achieve an exceptionally high lift - to - drag ( L/D ratio ) of the airplane .
The lift - to - drag of both Concord and Tu-144 is 7.5 ; while L/D of the Boeing 747 - 787 is in the neighborhood of 20 .
The SAX - 40 ’s L/D is reported to be in the range from 25 to 27 .
So far there ’s been only one series - produced aircraft that had a lift - to - drag similar to that of the SAX - 40 .
I ’m talking about the M - 55 , a Russian - built reconnaissance plane that had the L/D of about 25 , ” said Belokon .
Because the design of the SAX - 40 does not need a tail , used to provide additional lift and stability on conventional craft , it also cuts down on turbulent airflow and noise from the back of the plane .
The wingspan of the SAX - 40 measures 67.5 meters .
The distance seems somewhat excessive for a relatively light plane , compared to a 68.5 - meter wingspan of the Boeing 747 whose weight is 400 tons .
However , a broader wingspan means a larger wing area .
The three engines of the SAX - 40 are embedded within the blended wing design with the air intakes on top .
Besides , the output of the engines is channeled through what is known as a “ variable area exhaust nozzle . ”
The design has a number of other novelty features .
For example , the landing gear of the SAX - 40 would deploy at landing in a usual way yet the craft ’s landing gear is designed to minimize both drag and noise .
It would have fairings to cover the wheels and braking systems , creating as smooth a flow of air as possible .
The craft would hold its nose up while approaching the ground at a speed of 350-400 km /h .
The wings of a conventional aircraft have flaps to significantly improve the lift .
The SAX - 40 is flapless yet the leading edge of its wings is slightly dropped .
The drooped design helps improve the lift of the aircraft and reduce its speed without using flaps .
It is obvious that taking one ’s breath away was not the principal goal of the researchers and designers involved in the concept aircraft project .
“ The shape of the aircraft is a remarkable achievement in terms of aerodynamics .
The two most important purposes of shaping the plane like this definitely have to do with significant fuel savings while cruising , and a smooth and safe landing , ” said Belokon .
The designers of the new aircraft stress the point that the first passengers will be able to come aboard the SAX - 40 in the year 2030 at best provided that the design is approved by manufacturers .
It takes lots of funds and risks to get serial production of a new plane off the ground .
Besides , new industrial facilities will have to be built for the purpose .

70 Ways to Increase Your Brain Power By Steve Gillman ,
Author of Secrets of Lucky People You Want More Brainpower - Not Higher IQ Scores !
Okay , maybe you want higher IQ scores too .
The American Heritage Dictionary defines Intelligence Quotient as " The ratio of tested mental age to chronological age , usually expressed as a quotient multiplied by 100 . "
Basically , it 's a test of intelligence , with 100 as the average score .
There are some problems with IQ tests however .
A recent IQ test asked which of four fruits was different .
It was the one with more than one seed ; but what if you were not familiar with these fruits ?
Obviously this test is culturally biased .
You are assumed to have certain knowledge , yet you are being tested for intelligence , not knowledge .
Now look at these letters : " ANLDEGN . "
Rearrange them and you 'll have the name of a ( n ) : Ocean , Country , State , City or Animal .
This is from an IQ test I took .
Hmm ...
There are very few oceans , so I could eliminate those - but wait a second !
That 's a test taking technique .
An intelligence test should n't be testing your test - taking ability .
I 'm bound to score higher than a person of equal intelligence who has n't learned simple techniques for scoring higher on multiple - choice tests .
Real Life Results Versus Scores
Now let me ask you a question .
What was Henry Fords IQ ?
Who cares !
The man was one of the most innovative people of the last century , and he did what he did by surrounding himself with intelligent people .
That practice alone has to be worth more than 20 IQ points in terms of real life results .
Real life results are what you want , right ?
So if you want to be more creative , learn to use creative problem solving techniques .
If you want to concentrate better , there are techniques for that .
Learn to speed - read and you 'll have double the knowledge in the same time .
After you paint your first Mona Lisa , build your first skyscraper or make your first million , what will your IQ score be ?
Who cares !?
Okay , an imperfect test is better than no test at all , and it is entertaining .
I just took an IQ test , and although I do n't think my IQ is really the 138 it showed , it was fun .
If you really want to , you can try a free IQ test on my website http://www.IncreaseBrainPower.com.
Of course you 'll score higher on a good day than a bad day , so try these tips to make it a good IQ test day :
70 Ways to Better Brainpower
( In no particular order . )
1. Breath deep .
More air in means more oxygen in the blood and therefore in the brain .
Breath through your nose and you 'll notice that you use your diaphragm more , drawing air deeper into your lungs .
Several deep breaths can also help to relax you , which is conducive to clearer thinking .
2. Meditate .
A simple meditation you can do right now is just closing your eyes and paying attention to your breath .
Tensing up your muscles and then relaxing them to start may help .
When your mind wanders , just bring your attention back to your breath .
Five or ten minutes of this will usually relax you , clear your mind , and leave you more ready for any mental task .
3 . Sit up straight .
Posture affects your thinking process .
Prove it to yourself by doing math in your head while slouching , looking at the floor and letting your mouth hang open .
Then do the mental math while sitting up straight , keeping your mouth closed and looking forward or slightly upwards .
You 'll notice that it 's easier to think with the latter posture .
4. Phosphotidyl Serine ( PS ) .
This supplement has been shown in clinical studies to increase lucidity and rate of learning .
It activates cell - to - cell communication , helps regulate cell growth , improves the functioning of the special receptors found on cells , and prepares cells for activity .
In other words , it can help your brain power .
It 's also thought to reverse memory decline .
Phosphatidylserine has no known adverse side effects .
5.Vinpocetine .
This extract , derived from an alkaloid found in the Periwinkle plant , is used as a cerebral vasodilator .
It increases blood flow to the brain , which improves its oxygenation and thereby increases mental alertness and acuity .
Research suggests it may also be the most powerful memory enhancer available to date .
6. Gingko Biloba .
The leaves of this tree have been proven to increase blood flow to the brain .
The trees are often planted in parks .
My friends and I used to eat a few leaves when we wanted a brain boost .
It is also inexpensive , if you buy the capsules or tea at any health food store .
7. Saint John 's Wort .
This is a common weed that may be growing in your yard .
Although it 's brain enhancing qualities are less documented ( studies do show it 's usefulness for treating long - term depression ) , many people swear by it 's temporary mood - elevating effect , and our brains tend to function better when we are happy .
It is inexpensive , but I used to just collect it in the yard and make tea of it .
( Hyperacum Perforatum , if you want to look it up by it 's botanical name . )
8 . Good thinking habits .
Just use a problem solving technique for several weeks and it will become a habit .
Redesign everything you see for a while , and that will become a habit .
You can develop many good thinking habits with some effort , and then be more resourceful effortlessly from that point on .
Use the power of habit .
9 . Use dead time .
This is time that is otherwise wasted or just under-utilized .
Driving time , time spent in waiting rooms , or even time spent raking your yard can be included in this .
With a tape player and a trip to a public library , you can start to use this time to listen to books - on - tape .
You may spend 200 hours a year in your car .
What could you learn in that time ?
10 . Learn a language .
Learning a new language has been shown to halt the age - related decline in brain function .
It also introduces your mind to new concepts and new ways of looking at things ( in English we are afraid , whereas in Spanish we have fear ) .
It is one of the best brain exercises .
11 . Rosemary .
This common herb may have an effect on the brain when the scent is inhaled .
We are waiting for the research , but some people swear that just sniffing rosemary wakes up their brain .
It seems safe , so if you have rosemary in your spice rack , give it a try .
12 . Mindfulness exercises .
Concentration and clear thinking are more or less automatic once you remove distractions .
Learn to stop and watch your busy mind .
As you notice things that are subtly bothering you , deal with them .
This might mean making a phone call you need to make , or putting things on a list so you can forget them for now .
With practice , this becomes easier , and your thinking becomes more powerful .
13 . Write .
Writing is good for your mind in a number of ways .
It is a way to tell your memory what is important , so you 'll recall things more easily in the future .
It is a way to clarify your thinking .
It is a way to exercise your creativity and analytical ability .
Diaries , idea - journals , poetry , note - taking and story - writing are all ways to use writing to boost your brain power .
14 . Listen to Mozart .
In a study at the University of California , researchers found that children who studied piano and sang daily in chorus , were much better at solving puzzles , and when tested , scored 80 % higher in spatial intelligence than the non-musical group .
In another study , 36 students were given three spatial reasoning tests on a standard IQ test .
Just before the first test , they listened to Mozart 's sonata for Two Pianos in D Major , K. 448 for ten minutes .
Before the second test , they listened to a relaxation tape .
Before the third , they sat in silence .
The average scores for all 36 students : 1st test : 119 . 2nd test : 111. 3rd test : 110 . A nine - point boost from Mozart !
15 . Develop your intuition .
Intuition can be an important part of brainpower .
Einstein and others have relied heavily on their intuitive hunches .
16 . Avoid foods that cause subtle allergies .
These can include wheat , corn , peanuts and dairy products .
Watch yourself to see if you have a problem with any of these .
They cause digestive problems and brain fog in some people .
17 . Sleep better .
As long as you get a certain amount of sleep - probably a minimum of five hours - the quality seems to be more important than the quantity .
Also , short naps in the afternoon seem to work well to recharge the brain for some people .
18 . Caffeine .
The research shows higher test scores for students who drink coffee before major exams .
My chess game gets better .
In other studies , it has been shown that too much caffeine leads to poorer quality decisions .
Caffeine affects individuals differently , and has some nasty long - term side effects for some of us , but short - term - it works !
19 . Avoid sugar .
Any simple carbohydrates can give you " brain fog . "
Sometimes called the " sugar blues " as well , this sluggish feeling makes it hard to think clearly .
It results from the insulin rushing into the bloodstream to counteract the sugar rush .
Avoid pasta , sugars , white bread and potato chips before any important mental tasks .
> 20 . Hypnosis audios .
The power of suggestion is real , and one way to use it is with hypnosis tapes , CD 's or downloads .
This type of brain " programing " has more evidence for it than subliminals .
21 . Speed reading .
Contrary to what many believe , your comprehension of material often goes up when you learn to speed - read .
You get to learn a lot more in less time , and it is definitely a good brain exercise .
22 . Exercise .
Long term exercise can boost brainpower , which is n't surprising .
Anything that affects physical health in a positive way probably helps the brain too .
Recent research , though , shows that cognitive function is improved immediately after just ten minutes of aerobic exercise .
If you need a brain recharge , you might want to walk up and down the stairs a few times .
23 . Imaginary friends .
Talking to and getting advice from characters in your mind can be a great way to access the information in your subconscious mind .
Imagine a conversation with a person who has a lot of knowledge in the area you want advice in .
24 . Develop your creativity .
Creativity gives power to your thinking .
Raw computation can be done by computers now , but humans provide the creative thought that shapes our world .
25 . Learn more efficiently .
When you decide to learn something , take notes from the start .
Leave each " learning session " with a question or two in mind , to create anticipation and curiosity .
Take short breaks , so there will be more beginnings and endings to your studies ( Things learned at the beginning or ending of a class or session are remembered better ) .
26 . Use techniques for clear thinking .
Cluttered rooms and offices can contribute to cluttered thinking .
Organize a space for mental work .
Sigh , stretch , and take a deep breath before you start on a tough mental job .
Plan some distraction - free time for brainstorming .
27 . Brain wave entrainment .
The newest brain wave entrainment products are powerful tools for altering your brain function .
Some will almost immediately relax you , while others will put your brain waves in a pattern that is most conducive to analytical thinking .
28 . Creatine .
This is a compound found in meat , used by athletes to help build muscle .
Now the evidence is here to show that it helps your brain as well .
Proceedings B , a journal published by the Royal Society reports that the research showed improvement in working memory and general intelligence resulting from creatine supplementation .
The dose used in the study was 5 grams per day .
This is about the level used to boost sports performance , and is as much as you 'd normally get in four pounds of meat , according to lead researcher Dr. Caroline Rae .
29 . Talk .
Talking is only good for the brain if you are actually exercising it , of course .
Try explaining something that you do n't understand very well to a friend , though , and you 'll notice that the process of explaining will help you clarify your understanding .
30 .
Do something you enjoy .
This is a way to both lower stress and rev up your brain .
The key is to do something active .
Watching TV does n't count .
Whether it is playing Scrabble or building birdhouses , when you are actively engaged in an activity that you enjoy , you worry less about things and you start to think better .
31 . Adjust your beliefs .
Believe you are smarter , and you 'll become smarter .
For this , affirmations may work , but even better is evidence .
Make a note of your successes .
Tell yourself , " Hey , that was really creative , " when you do something creative .
When you have a good idea , make a note of it .
Gather the evidence for your own intelligence and you 'll start to experience more of it .
32 . Brain exercises .
Do math in your mind while driving .
Think of a new use for everything you see .
Regular use of the brain has been shown to generate new neuronal growth , and even halt the decline of mental function that often comes with age .
33 . Learn new things .
This is another way to exercise the brain .
It can also be done with little time investment if you use books - on - tapes while driving .
34 . Walk .
Exercise has been shown to benefit the brain , and walking is one of the best exercises for many .
It is low impact , and the rhythmic nature of it seems to put you in a state that is very conducive to clear thinking .
In fact , carry a tape recorder with you to take notes , and a twenty minute walk can be a great way to solve problems .
35 . Model others .
Find others that are creative , intelligent , or very productive .
Do what they do , and think what they think .
This is a key principle of neuro - linguistic programming .
Be careful about taking their advice , though .
Successful people often do n't really understand why they are successful .
Do what they do , not what they say .
36 . Eat fish .
Eating fish actually speeds up brain waves , and improves concentration .
Researchers have also found an almost perfect correlation between intake of fish and lowered levels of depression in the various countries of the world .
The U.S. has 24 times the incidence of depression as Japan , for example , where fish intake is much higher .
37 . Avoid unnecessary arguments .
When you defend a position too vigorously , especially when it is just to " win " the argument , you invest our ego into it .
This is not conducive to the easy acceptance and use of new information .
In other words , you put your mind in a rut , and you dig it deeper with each argument .
Debate can be a valuable thing , but when the ego takes over , the mind closes a little .
This is not a recipe for better thinking .
38 . Laugh .
The release of endorphins caused by laughter lowers stress levels , which is good for long term brain health .
Laughter also tends to leave you more open to new ideas and thoughts .
39 . Play .
Stimulating the brain causes measurable changes in the structure of the brain .
New connections are made and new brain cells are grown .
Intellectual play , as well as any playing that involves hand - eye coordination stimulates the brain .
40 .
Do puzzles .
Crossword puzzles , lateral thinking puzzles , and even good riddles are a great way to get brain exercise .
You can work on them while waiting for a dentist appointment , or on the bus , if you are short on time .
41 . Sing .
When you are alone in your car , try singing about something you are working on .
This taps into and exercises your right brain .
Have you ever noticed how it is easier to rhyme when you sing than when you just speak or write ?
This is because the right brain is better at pattern recognition .
By doing this brain exercise regularly you can train yourself to tap into the power of the right brain .
This will make you a more effective problem - solver .
If you doubt the distinction between the hemispheres of the brain , look at how stutterers can stop stuttering as soon as they start singing .
Try it .
42 . Nuts .
University students in Brazil and other South American countries often eat several Brazil nuts before an exam , believing they are good for their mental power .
The evidence is starting to confirm this .
Other nuts that have minerals and amino acids that are beneficial to the brain include almonds and walnuts .
43 . Olive oil .
High in mono- unsaturated fat , olive oil has been shown to improve memory .
A cheaper alternative is canola oil , but this has n't been studied much yet .
44 . Vitamin supplements .
In studies , children scored higher on tests when on a regimen of daily vitamin supplements .
" Experts " will tell you that if you eat a balanced diet , you do n't need supplements , which , given the culture here , is really just a sales pitch for vitamins , is n't it ?
Who eats a perfectly balanced diet ?
45 . Fiber .
It is n't just what goes in , but what comes out that is important to brain function .
Toxic build - up in the body and brain can cause " brain fog . "
People often report clearer thinking as one of the benefits of curing their constipation .
46 . Self awareness .
This may not seem important to brain power , but it is .
When you know yourself better , you can avoid the usual effects of ego and emotion in your seemingly " rational " thinking .
Or you can at least take it into account .
Watch yourself , especially as you explain things or argue .
47 . Motivate yourself .
Motivation is as important to mental tasks as it is to any other .
Learn a few simple techniques for self motivation .
48 . Avoid too much stress .
Neuropsychiastrist Richard Restak , M.D. , form the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Services , sums up the research thus : " Stress causes brain damage . "
Long term stress has repeated been shown to hurt the brain , not to mention the rest of the body .
Learn a few stress reduction techniques if you get stressed out often .
49 .
Get educated .
Scientists have known for a while that the less educated get alzheimer 's more frequently .
Education in any area seems to make the brain stronger .
50 .
Avoid too much fat .
In laboratory studies , animals consistently learn slower when they are on a diet high in fat .
Type of fat may make a difference , so you may want to stick to using olive oil and other non-saturated fats .
Saturated fats have been shown to actually stunt the growth of brain cells .
51 . Eat less .
Overeating has the immediate effect of redirecting more blood to the digestive process , leaving less for the brain .
Long term , it can cause arterial obstructions that reduce blood flow to the brain permanently .
In at least one study , rats on a restricted - calorie diet had more brainpower .
52 . Avoid suspect foods .
There is evidence that the following foods can be bad for your brain : Artificial food colorings , artificial sweeteners , colas , corn syrup , frostings , high - sugar drinks , hydrogenated fats , sugars , white bread , and any white - flour products .
53 . Eat breakfast .
When kids who did n't eat breakfast started to eat it , researchers found that their math scores went up a whole grade on average .
54 . Avoid diabetes .
The development of diabetes coincides with a dropping of IQ scores .
In other words , if you want to maintain your brain power , follow your doctors dietary recommendations for preventing or treating diabetes .
55 .
Eat foods high in antioxidants .
Antioxidants protect all your cells , including brain cells .
Some of the foods highest in antioxidants include : prunes , raisins , blueberries , blackberries , garlic , kale , cranberries , strawberries , spinach , and raspberries .
In one test , rats had age - related mental decline reversed by eating the equivalent of a 1 /2 cup of blueberries per day .
56 . Drink wine .
In moderation , red wine can be good for the brain , it seems .
It is rich in antioxidants , which protect brain cells .
One glass per day for women and two for men is usually considered a safe and moderate amount .
57 .
Use alcohol in moderation .
In a study at the University of Indiana School of Medicine , elderly light drinkers ( fewer than 4 drinks per week ) scored higher on tests of thinking abilities than non-drinkers .
Those who drank 10 or more drinks per week scored lower .
It is known that alcohol can kill brain cells , so moderation seems to be the key .
58 . Folic acid .
According to one study , 200 micrograms of folic acid , the amount found in 3/4 cup of cooked spinach , alleviates depression and reverses memory loss .
59 . Potential brain foods .
Other foods that may be good for your brain include : Avocados , bananas , lean beef , brewer 's yeast .
broccoli , brown rice , brussel sprouts , cantaloupe , cheese , chicken , collard greens , eggs , flaxseed oil , legumes , oatmeal , oranges , peanut butter , peas , potatoes , romaine lettuce , salmon , soybeans , spinach , tuna , turkey , wheat germ , and yogurt .
60 . Vitamin E. Jean Carper , in researching her book , " Your Miracle Brain , " found that many brain researchers are taking 400 I.U.s of vitamin E daily .
It is an antioxidant , and reduces the clogging of blood vessels , including those going in the brain .
61 . Vitamin C. Taken in the form of orange juice in a study at the Texas Women 's University , vitamin C increased the IQ scores of children .
62 . Selenium .
100 micrograms of selenium has been shown to be a mood - elevator .
Your brain almost certainly functions better when you are in a better mood .
Foods rich in selenium include Brazil nuts and garlic .
63 . Alpha-lipoic acid .
Alpha-lipoic acid ( 10 to 50 milligrams daily ) improves memory and protects nerve cells .
64 . Inositol .
This is a safe and natural substance that is often grouped with the B-vitamins .
It reduces stress and promotes clear thinking .
It contributes to energy production , and so can " wake you up . "
Animal studies show a measurable increase in physical activity for up to five hours after taking it .
65 . Huperzine A . This is a compound extracted from the Chinese club moss .
Researchers both in Israel and the U.S. have used it to treat alzheimer's .
It improves memory and learning an seems to be very safe .
66 . Ask questions .
This is a great way to keep your brain in shape .
Just get in the habit of asking questions often , even if it is only in your own mind .
Why are taller buildings better ?
what is the purpose of curbs ?
Ask anything that comes to mind , and ponder the possible answers .
67 . Sniff basil .
This another of the herbs that may be good for your brain .
No studies yet , but many report a brain boost from smelling basil .
68 . Temperature .
Many people have noted that they think better at certain temperatures .
In general , it seems that being slightly cool , but not uncomfortable , is most conducive to good thinking .
Try experimenting on yourself to see what temperature works best for you .
69 .
Use systems .
From the time I was ten years old , 12 x 49 was always ( 12 x 50 ) - 12 .
It 's easier to figure in your head this way ( 588 , by the way ) .
I did n't get any credit for my personal algorithms then , but they are selling these shortcuts on late - night TV now , because they work .
You can find your own easier ways to do mental math or other mental tasks , or read a good book on them .
70 .
Make a brainpower plan .
It takes about twenty to thirty days of repetition to establish new habits , many psychologists will tell you .
This means that when you create your plan for better brainpower , be sure you plan to use that new problem solving technique , or eat those new brain foods for at least three weeks .
You can use many of the brain boosters here and get immediate results , but it is creating new habits that will give you the most brainpower .

History is littered with visions of the 21st Century that never came true .
But big companies still employ futurologists to make radical predictions about the next few years .
Spencer Kelly investigates how they come up with their visions of the future .
One minute it is giant leaps to the stars , the next it is a journey through inner space .
From contacting life on other worlds to creating artificial life down here on Earth , any future is , in theory , possible .
It is the futurologist 's job to map out a path for their employers , spotting business opportunities and risks , identifying social changes , and steering their company towards the best profits .
Futurologist for BT , Ian Pearson says : " I 've got a lot of experience of working in different aspects of engineering , so I 've got a good feel of how fast the different areas are going .
" So if I 'm tracking what people are starting to do research and development on today , by going to conferences and reading technical magazines and stuff , I 've got a fair idea of what 's likely to be around , and I can guess fairly accurately how long it 's going to take before it comes .
INVENTIONS THAT NEVER WERE
Click here to see what the futurologists got wrong
" The idea of incorporating a computer , which has got a lifetime of about a year , into a fridge which has to last 10 years just does n't make any sense , so you can say there 's probably no real mass market for internet fridges . "
In fact , the intelligent fridge is just one of many inventions we were promised , which failed to take the world by storm .
Of course it is much easier to explain why something did not work , than trying to predict what will work in the future .
Radical visions
Flying cars were another idea that still has not quite taken off yet .
But even while laughing off the internet fridge and the flying car , today 's futurists continue to make outlandish predictions .
The future is about emotion .
It 's about how people feel about technology
Trends analyst Dr Patrick Dixon
" The problem is that if you 're a futurologist there 's no point in playing it safe .
You have to be revolutionary and radical , you have to sell a big idea , or else what 's the point of you ?
The problem is revolutionary , radical , big ideas very rarely come true . "
Emotional connection
A gadget can become popular if people can bond with it
But even the relatively small steps of predicting the next big thing are easy to get wrong .
Trends analyst Dr Patrick Dixon says : " The past is full of graveyards of bit and pieces of gadgets which form no particularly useful function , or even if the did , they did n't connect with the passions and emotions that people had and they rejected it .
" You can get really focused on technology and the latest innovation , but the fact is the future is about emotion .
" It 's about how people feel about technology , it 's about how people actually want to live , and that 's what really makes the difference . "
Emotion is definitely the driving force behind one device we saw as part of a recent innovations showcase .
A picture in the frame remains still until you look directly at it , at which point the photograph comes to life .
We also saw pocket - sized pebbles that can receive signals across the mobile phone network , and will vibrate or heat up accordingly .
So you really can send your loved one a warm glow , or literally give them a buzz .
The futurologists are not trying to make them happen , they are just considering the implications of them happening
Perhaps you prefer a media centre which reacts differently depending which object you place on the scanner .
A wedding ring might call up a photo album , while a child 's toy might load their personal webmail .
Long - term vision
The latest technology timeline released by BT suggests hundreds of different inventions for the next few decades including :
2012 : personal ' black boxes ' record everything you do every day
2015 : images beamed directly into your eyeballs
2017 : first hotel in orbit
2020 : artificial intelligence elected to parliament
2040 : robots become mentally and physically superior to humans
2075 ( at the earliest ) : time travel invented
These predictions may sound far - fetched , but we have to bear in mind that they are really only suggestions .
The futurologists are not trying to make them happen , they are just considering the implications of them happening .
Will the futurologists be proved right when it comes to robots ?
If ever there was a symbol of the third millennium , surely it is technology in human form .
After years of development , this possibility is finally coming true .
Yes , the path of technological development is by no means guaranteed , but you never know , the future may just happen after all .
Okay , since I 'm apparently in " 2006 doom and gloom " mode here 's another observation that I can re-brand as a 2006 prediction .
2006 will the year in which the once great Slashdot dies .
Unlike the death of Feedster , Slashdot will likely take years to really die .
It has a loyal following and momentum .
But this is this year in which the services that ultimately replace Slashdot break out and become unstoppable ( for a while ) .
There 's little question that Digg is one of the most likely candidates to take the lead from Slashdot .
The numbers seem to bear that out .
But what 's more interesting to me is why Slashdot is on its way out .
Community Participation and Judgment
There 's always been a sense of frustration among those who submit news to Slashdot .
Sometimes your story is picked and sometimes it is n't .
After a while , you start to wonder why Slashdot 's small group of dictators ( err , I mean " editors " ) are qualified to decide what 's interesting news .
Have n't we figured out that the crowd is generally smarter than any one individual in the crowd ?
Sites like Digg and Reddit understand that .
Even the popular page on del.icio.us provides a more useful insight into the collective mind of a small but active piece of the web .
The only difference is that del.icio.us does n't facilitate discussion .
Both Digg and Reddit allow users to comment on any URL that 's been posted .
For whatever reason , some people still think that Slashdot is a blog .
I think of it as a message board in which only a small group of the members have the privileges required to create new posts .
It 's interesting to note that Kuro5hin opened the editorial queue to their users for voting and comments but it never quite took off in the same way .
I drifted away from the site a couple years ago , but suspect that it 's a matter of focus .
K5 has always placed more of an emphasis on writing , personal stories , and politics rather than what 's hot now , spreading links or memes , and Google worship .
The Generation Gap
Let 's face it .
The Slashdot guys are getting old ( just as I am ! ) .
But the core audience that fuels Slashdot has always been a fairly young crowd .
Reading the comments now and then provides a window into who the regular contributors are :
male
geeks
high school or college students or recent graduates
I know that 's quite a generalization , but it's hard to deny that Slashdot would be anything without the core group of young geeks with more time than money .
Every year that goes by is another year in the age gap between that group and the Slashdot editors .
Chad and I were discussing generation gaps in the Internet technologies world recently and decided that generations are roughly 7 years .
We both agreed that it 's going to be increasingly hard for Slashdot to stay relevant in the face of younger , more open services like Digg and Reddit .
Sure , they can find and promote some young new editors to introduce " new blood " into the process .
But that 's not the same .
It 's still Slashdot .
The site has a voice , the community has a reputation , and the entire code base was written to support them .
That stuff is hard to change .

The Tritone Effect
Your browser does not appear to be capable of running Java applets .
The following discussion assumes familiarity with the Shepard 's Tones illusion , so if you have n't yet explored it you should do so now .
Although pitch discrimination cues have been carefully removed from Shepard 's Tones , proximity information remains .
Two consecutive tones are always separated by a single semitone .
So although you can't really determine which is higher based on the tones alone , your choice is that the second tone is either one semitone higher or eleven semitones lower in pitch than the first .
It is natural for the smaller distance to be automatically selected .
This can be thought of as an auditory counterpart of the apparent motion generated by the colour bar illusion .
In that illusion , the cue used to determine the direction of motion can be eliminated , resulting in a pattern which does n't appear to move at all .
In the case of Shepard 's Tones , what would happen if the proximity cue was removed ?
In other words , what would you hear if the second tone played was either half an octave higher or half an octave lower than the first ?
( The midpoint of the octave is called the tritone , hence the name of the current illusion . )
In 1987 , the psychologist Diana Deutsch published a paper entitled The tritone paradox : Effects of spectral variables [ Deutsch - 87 ] that explored exactly this question .
Her findings were surprising in a number of respects .
The applet window contains several different controls that can be used to explore the tritone paradox .
The basic demonstration , however , requires only the Start button .
When pressed , this button will cause two of Shepard 's Tones , separated by half an octave , to be played alternately and repeatedly .
You should attempt to judge which one is higher in pitch .
Once you have made this decision , you should also spend a few moments to determine whether you can force yourself to hear the other as higher ( in much the same way that you may have been able to switch at will between the two possible orientations of Necker 's cube ) .
Next , select the Display switch .
This will display the currently sounding tone using the same format as for Shepard 's Tones .
You can use the label at the top of the vertical axis to name the tone which sounds higher .
Make note of the label of the higher sounding tone , then switch the Base frequency selection from 110 Hz to 160 Hz .
Which tone sounds higher in pitch now ?
It is often quite interesting to show this demonstration to a large audience .
At a base frequency of 110 Hz , most people will perceive Tone 1 as being higher than Tone 2 .
But a small percentage of people will hear the opposite order ( and they may be reluctant to oppose the apparent consensus of the group , so you may need to do some gentle coaxing to identify them ) .
When the base frequency is switched , most people will perceive the opposite ordering .
In actual fact , Tone 2 is higher than Tone 1 at both base frequencies ( higher in the sense that each component of Tone 2 is half an octave higher than the corresponding component of Tone 1 ) .
Nevertheless , most people hear Tone 1 as higher in at least on of the conditions .
There are at least two mysterious aspects of this illusion .
First , the direction in which the ambiguity is resolved does not appear to be random but depends instead on the absolute frequencies involved .
If you heard the first tone as higher at a base frequency of 110 Hz , you can be confident that if you try return to this illusion next week or next year you will hear it the same way .
This is surprising because perfect pitch ( the ability to identify the absolute pitch of a tone ) is rare , but it appears to be the absolute pitch which determines how the ambiguity is resolved .
As Deutsch points out in a separate article [ Deutsch - 92 ] , this is analogous to having the perception of an image ( in isolation ) reliably change as it is shifted in space .
Clearly this is a unique aspect of audition .
Perhaps more unusual still is the result of a study , reported by Deutsch in her second article , which found that British subjects reliably resolved the ambiguity in one direction while Californian subjects reliably resolved it in the other !

It was the only way Walter Butler could let his fiancee know he was still alive .
But the hastily signed field service card he sent from the Flanders trenches never made it to Amy Hicks .
Ninety years later , it was the couple 's daughter Joyce Hulbert , an 86 - year - old grandmother , who finally took delivery .
Royal Mail officials admitted they were at a loss to explain why the post was nine decades late .

• Postie sorts postcard addressed to ' Yellow Door '
scroll down for more
The 21 - year - old soldier had addressed the card to his sweetheart 's family home in Colerne , near Chippenham , Wiltshire .
The couple went on to marry after his return from the war .
They moved to London and their daughter Joyce arrived .
Sadly , they later divorced .
When the Second World War broke out , Mrs Butler brought her daughter back to her mother 's house in Colerne to escape the Blitz .
Joyce , now Mrs Hulbert , still lives there with her husband Arthur , 82 , a retired civil servant .
The card was found at their local Royal Mail sorting office .
' This card was Dad 's only way of getting word home to my mother that he was still alive , but it is obviously one that she never got , ' Mrs Hulbert said .
' I am very surprised that it turned up , I would love to know where it has been all this time so I can thank whoever kept it in such good condition .
' The soldiers were issued field service cards which carried just a few lines of pre-printed information .
' They had to delete the bits that were not appropriate but were not allowed to write anything else on the cards except their names and the date . '
Her father 's card contained the printed message : ' I am quite well .
Letter follows at first opportunity .
I have received no letter from you for a long time . '
Mr Butler , who served in the Dorset Regiment , added his name and the date - November 5 , 1917 .
Mrs Hulbert said her father , who was 18 when he was sent to the trenches , rarely spoke about the war on his return .
She had no idea exactly where he had fought .
' My father always told me that he survived the war because he could run fast and hit hard , ' she said .
The card bears only a general ' Field Post Office ' stamp .
However , this mark is mysteriously dated July 28 , 1915 - more than two years earlier than the 1917 date Mr Butler indicated .
It was found at Chippenham Sorting Office last week , after arriving in a batch of mail from Swindon .
Postman Martin Kay called in friends Adrian and Margaret Wood from the village history society in the hope of tracking down any relatives .
Mrs Wood , a friend of Mrs Hulbert , remembered her maiden name was Butler and put the postman in touch with her .
Mr Kay said staff at the sorting office were baffled as to the card 's whereabouts all these years .
' We can only imagine that it may have been lost in an Army barracks somewhere or it has been hidden behind a fitting in a building , ' he said .
' We thought it might have been a joke at first because we could n't believe it . '
Mrs Hulbert 's mother Amy remained in Colerne until she died in 1974 aged 81 .
She never remarried .
Her father , who went on to work as a builder and decorator after his wartime service , did marry again .
He died in 1978 aged 82 .
Could you imagine driving a car where the steering wheel was n't very responsive ?
How good of a driver would you be if you had to make your steering adjustments 30 seconds in advance ?
Driving on a highway would be nearly impossible , as you and everyone else around you would have to plan for the actions and reactions of everyone for the next half minute .
You would have all the finnese of a 7 year old kid at Disney 's Tomorrowland Raceway .
More to the point - what if you had a simple programming assignment .
Your job : Modify a hundreds files that are stored on a remote server using your favorite editor .
The only limitation is that you can't transfer the files to your local computer .
Edit them remotely you will .
Put on the noise cancellation head phones , spin up your favorite playlists and you 're on your way .
But what if I gave you a connectivity choice ?
You can go with the fancy pants T1 or an old school 56 k modem .
Which one would you choose ?
Well , duh , everyone is going to choose the T1 .
How could you not choose a T1 ?
I mean , come on , a T1 vs. a modem ?
That 's not even a fair contest .
But what if the latency of the T1 was 250 ms ?
I do n't know about you but I * have * to go with the modem .
When I type I can see that I 'm doing the right thing , so I keep going .
If I 'm doing well and the typing is smooth , I 'll type faster - rising to the challenge of keeping up .
The clicks of my keyboard can match the clicks of the crisp monospaced characters that I see on the screen .
The synergy from the interaction of keyboard to screen is wonderous .
It 's The Flow , the zone , that moment of productivity when there are no roadblocks , only typing .
The only " thing " discernible is that of forward motion .
Zip zip along .
No interuptions .
Just you and the machine .
No discrete steps .
Just motion .
My fingers slip every so often , but that 's ok , because the feedback is instant .
I know I 've typed the wrong thing .
I back up , edit it , and keep going .
I compensate .
If the code is tricky , I slow down .
It 's the instant feedback that allows me to adjust .
The speed of the response is what enables me to move ahead as quickly as possible .
When the latency gets worse , my personal productivity bandwidth goes down .
My typing deteriorates significantly as my keyboarding no longer feels interactive .
I start to stumble as my typing runs ahead of the clock of reality .
I fall off the tracks and my typing runs amuck .
I 'm off in the weeds .
My thoughts jumble together .
I get lost .
We live in a world where we are inundated with the idea that more is always better .
Clock cycles go up ( at least they used to ) .
Hard drives , monitors , camera megapixels , version numbers of our favorite programs ... more more more up up up .
Not that there 's anything wrong with that .
But
we 're so conditioned to living this way that we short sell the kind of numbers that should go down .
I think we 're so used to thinking about " bandwidth " that we overlook " latency " in all of its forms .
For example , Paul Graham and the lispnicks derive some of their smug superiority [ 1 ] from their beloved REPL because it removes the latencies inherent in the edit , compile , link , run , debug cycle .
If the cycle takes too long ( ie : if the latencies get too high ) , you stumble and lose momentum .
Or better , you alt - tab away and spend time in bloglines .
Joel makes a solid case for a daily build - which lowers the latency for a developer to see their changes .
Code goes in and hours later - binaries pour out .
The faster it comes back at you , the faster you can put it in again .
You can make adjustments in real time or close to it .
Those automated mechanisms reduce the roundtrip time of thought in and product out .
And that 's what software development is really about .
Right ?
Thoughts go in which are translated into code and then " product " comes out the other side .
So simple .
This happens at all levels of development whether its an inhouse class framework , a project on sourceforge , or a million dollar product with 50 cooks in the kitchen .
Thoughts in .
Product out .
Software development is a conversation .
Which leads to a curious trait about latencies - latencies change the sturcture of a conversation .
What you say , and how you say it changes based on the mode of communication .
How you structure a written letter , or even a lengthy email is fundamentally different from an instant message conversation .
You can express the same ideas in all mediums - but how you do it , and how quickly you can get to your end goal is heavily influenced by the latencies involved .
You can see this effect even when making a phone call to a far away place .
There 's just enough latency in the conversation to break up the flow - both parties move ahead with the graceful walk of a potato sack race .
For the developer working alone , it 's just you and the machine .
But if you working as part of a group , you 'll have a set of folks surrounding all of those coders .
Those folks sit at one end of the idea factory and the compiler sits at the other end .
What happens in the middle is a lot of talking ,
frequently too much of it in hushed mumbles .
The talking becomes more focused when it can be feedback in near real time .
I think all of the hullaballo about extreme programming and its less rigid extended family - agile practices - was about lowering the latencies in the development cycle .
Most of their good practices focus on just that .
That 's when the structure of the development conversation changes - it becomes real time and it becomes interactive .
And do n't forget that long latencies are a great way to drive engineers out of an organization .
I think that 's another way of looking at what was bugging Marc Lucovsky at Microsoft .
Engineers puts code in .
Long pause .
Long pause .
Long undramatic pause .
And then stuff goes out to the users .
How completely unrewarding .
What 's the point ?
There 's no payoff .
Software developers may seem like an introverted crowd with a disposition towards anti-social grooming practices , but like everyone else , they want feedback .
They want a sense of impact on the world .
Software is such an abstract craft that getting a real tangible payoff can be elusive .
Latencies only add to that ephemeral nature .
One great way to improve software development is to squeeze the longest latencies out of your development conversation .
It 's the best way to keep you zipping along the great competitive highway and avoid those nasty concrete dividers .
[ 1 ]
Well , lispnicks have lots to be smug about .
Market share is n't one of them though .
Update :
Originally submitted for Joel 's second book of essays , but since that 's been shelved - I 'm curious to see how the reddit.com crowd rates it .
Nicht sicher
Der Internet Explorer ist auf den meisten Computern das Programm mit den größten Sicherheitsrisiken .
Der Großteil der Spyware ( Spionage - Software ) und Adware ( ungewollte Werbung ) auf den Computern kommt durch die Sicherheitslöcher des Internet Explorers .
Eine Studie ( englisch ) im Oktober 2004 fand heraus , dass 80 % von Heimcomputern mit Spyware oder Adware infiziert waren , obwohl 85 % Antiviren - Programme installiert hatten .
Studien haben ergeben , dass diese Prozentangaben von infizierten Computern bei Benutzern des Internet Explorers höher lagen als Nutzer anderer Browser .
Das kommt daher , weil der Internet Explorer dafür konzipiert wurde , Webseiten Zugriff auf den Computer des Benutzers zu gewähren .
Bösartige Webseiten können diesen Zustand für ihre Zwecke missbrauchen und , ohne dass der Nutzer es bemerkt , automatisch Programme installieren und einen Virus einschleusen .
Microsoft meint dazu , die einzige Lösung sei , das ganze Betriebssystem neu aufzusetzen ( englisch ) .
Diese Sicherheitslöcher gibt es wegen eines grundlegenden Fehlers am Konzept des Internet Explorers und wegen Microsofts langsamem und uneffizientem Reaktionsverhalten gegenüber diese Sicherheitslöcher .
Der leitende technische Angestellte von Microsoft , Craig Mundie , meinte : „ Viele Programme , die wir in der Vergangenheit geschrieben haben , sind weniger sicher als sie sein könnten , weil wir unser Hauptaugenmerk auf Funktionen / Features setzen und nicht auf Sicherheit [… ] .
Wir verkauften neue Anwendungsprogramme aufgrund neuer Funktionen , welche die Mehrheit der Benutzer dann nicht verwendete . “
Trotz monatlicher Sicherheitsupdates von Microsoft , steigt die Zahl der Sicherheitslücken weiterhin stärker als sie behoben werden .
Laut einer Studie zu Sicherheitslücken in Browsern wurde ein vollständig aktualisierter Internet Explorer für 78 % des Jahres 2006 als " unsicher " ( ungeschützt wegen gravierender , bekannter Schwachstellen ) befunden .
Dagegen war der Konkurrent Mozilla Firefox nur für 2 % des Jahres " unsicher " .
Der Internet Explorer bleibt ein ungeheuer großes Sicherheitsrisiko auf Ihrem Computer .
Sogar das U.S. Department of Homeland Security empfiehlt bereits einen Umstieg ( englisch ) auf einen anderen Browser .
Im Mai 2006 kürte PC World den Internet Explorer zum achtschlechtesten technischen Produkt aller Zeiten und nannte es die " möglicherweise unsicherste Software des Planeten " .
Nachstehend folgt eine kurze Übersicht der Sicherheitsniveaus der drei meistbenutzten Browser für Windows .
Die Daten wurden von Secunia zusammengetragen , einer führenden Firma im Bereich Überwachung der Sicherheit von Computersoftware .
Die Statistik umfasst alle bekannten Schwachstellen des Internet Explorers , von Firefox und Opera unter einem aktuell gehaltenen MS Windows vom 9 .
Februar 2004 bis heute .
( Das ist ungefähr die halbe Zeitspanne seit dem ersten Bekanntwerden einer Sicherheitslücke im jüngsten der 3 Browser , Firefox . )
Das relative Gefahrenniveau wurde errechnet aus der Summe der quadrierten Gefährlichkeitsstufen der einzelnen Schwachstellen ( nicht gefährlich = 1 , höchst gefährlich = 5 ) .
„ Schwerwiegende Sicherheitslücken ” sind all jene , die als " hoch gefährlich " und " höchst gefährlich " eingestuft werden .
Eine Schwachstelle wurde als unsicher erachtet , wenn sie vom Browserhersteller bis jetzt nicht vollständig geschlossen werden konnte .

One of the commissioners on the board of the Federal Communications Commission is taking shots at the state of broadband in the US .
In an op - ed piece in yesterday 's Washington Post , Democrat commissioner Michael J. Copps criticized the state of broadband in the US and called for changes in how the FCC handles broadband .
The problem
Part of the problem comes from how the FCC defines broadband penetration .
Under the Commission 's guidelines , a zip code is said to be served by broadband if there is a single person within its boundaries with a 200 kbps connection .
Not only is that a metric that sets the broadband bar incredibly lowless than four times faster than dial - up  but it does nothing to assess how deeply broadband service has penetrated into a given area .
Copps also cites a sad litany of metrics .
According to the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , the US sits in 15th place worldwide when it comes to broadband penetration .
The US does even worse with another ITU metric , the Digital Opportunity Index ( DOI ) .
The DOI measures 11 different variables , including Internet access price , proportion of users online , and proportion of homes with Internet access , and it slots the US in at the number 21 position , right between Estonia and Slovenia ( South Korea , Japan , and Denmark top the DOI ) .
Most US residents stuck with a subpar broadband connections will agree that the biggest problem is competition .
We have talked about the cable / DSL duopoly before on Ars , and as Copps points out , duopolies are best - case scenarios at the moment .
Many broadband users are stuck with only one option when it comes to broadband .
The solution
According to Copps , " the FCC needs to start working to lower prices and introduce competition . "
Unfortunately , Copps ' vision of competition does n't appear to address what is arguably the biggest problem of all : the FCC 's policy of classifying broadband as an information service , deregulating it , and counting upon competition between modes of delivery ( e.g. , cable vs. DSL ) to save the day .
Copps ignores that issue altogether , calling on to FCC to speed up the process of making unlicensed spectrum available and encourage " third pipe " broadband technologies such as BPL ( broadband over power lines ) and wireless .
Those proposals are a start , but by themselves are not enough to effect significant change in the near term .
BPL , despite the periodic attention it gets , has less than 6,000 customers in the US .
By and large , utilities have not shown themselves to be interested in getting into the ISP business .
Opening up spectrum is no panacea , either .
WiMAX deployments are just beginning and will not come cheaply .
Here are a couple of other suggestions .
First , cities and towns should be allowed if not encouraged to build and deploy broadband networks .
This goes beyond rolling out city - wide WiFi networks and into the area of fiber optics .
Currently , a handful of states bar municipal governments from rolling their own fiber optic networks .
The massive rewrite of telecom legislation that emerged from the Senate Commerce Committee last summer would override such state - level restrictions , allowing any city to get into the game .
That bill has been stalled , however , and is unlikely to see the light of day in light of the election results this week .
Another option the FCC should seriously consider is turning back the clock on deregulation .
Up until the FCC classified DSL as an information service , ILECs ( incumbent local exchange carriers phone companies ) were required to lease their lines to DSL providers at competitive rates .
That left consumers with a number of choices for DSL : your local phone company , EarthLink , and Speakeasy to name three .
In the wake of deregulation , that is no longer the case .
Sure , the ILEC will still lease its lines to other companies , but it will cost them .
Cole Reinward , EarthLink 's VP for municipal product strategy and marketing , told Ars Technica earlier this week that the DSL wholesale rates offered to EarthLink by ILECs " were n't particularly attractive and close to what they are offering retail to subscribers , making it difficult to compete on price . "
Copps calls for the kind of " public - private initiatives like those that built the railroad , highway , and telephone systems . "
That 's an excellent start just look at the increasing number of municipal WiFi networks being developed via city - company partnerships .
But when the private sector drops the ball , the public sector needs to have free rein to step in .
Witness Qwest in Seattle : the telecom has refused to deploy fiber in Seattle while at the same time lobbying against the city 's developing its own network .
Let 's also get our metrics straight .
Although 200 kbps might look good to someone whose only alternative is dial - up , it 's a joke when it comes to broadband .
Revise it to something realistic , like 768 kbps , which has become the lowest - tiered DSL offering available in most geographies and arguably marks the lower limit of " true " broadband .
And make sure we rely on a representative sampling of an area to determine broadband penetration instead of the current single - person - in - a - zip - code model .
It seems like everybody agrees on an essential point : access to " quality , " reasonably priced broadband is crucial in this day and age .
Unfortunately , we 're not even close in the US .
Yes , the nation 's two largest telecoms are at this moment rolling out new fiber optic networks .
Better yet , consumers in areas served by Verizon 's new FiOS network are seeing the benefits of increased competition : some cable providers in those areas are bumping speeds up to 15 M bps / 1.5 Mbps .
However , fiber deployments are slow and selective , leaving most Americans out in the cold .
We may be looking at a radically different landscape in five years , with WiMAX , BPL , cable , DSL , and municipal WiFi networks offering consumers a host of equally - good choices .
That rosy outcome is by no means guaranteed there 's much that has to be done in the interim to make it a reality .
Further reading :
Opinion 2005 proved one thing .
The music industry really is as dumb as you think .
US CD sales in 2005 fell 3.5 per cent year - over - year , according to Nielsen Soundscan .
That 's quite a blow given that CD sales actually rose by 2.3 per cent in 2004 .
A sane person might suggest that higher energy costs throughout 2005 ate up a few of those sales or that pricey iPods left less cash to spend on albums .
This logic escapes the Recording Industry Association of American ( RIAA ) , which again attributes the fall in sales to piracy and which last year attributed the rise in sales to better anti-piracy measures .
So which is it ?
Are the RIAA 's anti-piracy measures affecting sales or not ?
Well , in 2005 , the RIAA filed 7,000 more lawsuits against consumers - bringing the all - time total to more than 16,000 .
Along with the movie crew , it also managed to shutdown many of the most popular BitTorrent hubs .
In addition , the US Supreme Court handed the RIAA a convenient decision against Grokster that holds P2P sites liable for their users ' actions .
Last but not least , the Down Under version of the RIAA convinced a court to clamp down on Kazaa .
All in all , 2005 marked a banner year for quashing CD piracy in the courts and on the internet .
You'd think sales would have gone up once again , if you buy into the RIAA 's way of thinking .
While P2P networks still thrive , they 're mostly full of porn and mangled media .
No one in their right mind or at least with a day job would sit there trying to pull down these tunes when they can buy a perfect album at the store .
Similarly , movies take forever to download and come out looking pretty shite for the most part .
The P2P networks - not that they were ever that great - are n't what they used to be , if hunting for music is your main goal .
Given all this , it would seem like the RIAA has the piracy fiends by their song - swapping balls .
If they do n't , then what 's the next course of action ?
Well , there are n't many sites left to shut down .
In fact , without major media hubs to go after , the music publishers are now reaching to examine sites that post lyrics to songs .
( We 've bought many a song after lyric hunting , but that 's surely because we 're odd , totally unique , not mainstream creatures . )
Along with the evil lyric mongers , consumers will likely be targeted by another 10,000 or so lawsuits in 2006 .
Then the RIAA can wait for the year - end data and say either that its war on piracy really boosted sales or that piracy continues to undermine the very fabric of the creative process , and this pattern will continue until the music industry enjoys a protracted boom .
Sadly , the RIAA 's current line of thinking and method of operation prohibits such a boom .
Without question , the lawsuits against children , parents and grandparents do n't help the music industry 's public relations campaign .
Nor do advertisements portraying download - happy consumers as criminals .
It is wrong to grab this music without compensating artists .
That 's clear .
What is n't clear is if suing thousands of people a year to prove a point is a punishment that fits the crime or a strategy worth pursuing .
Lord knows ,
Bono put food on his table this Christmas , Britney Spears can still throw away her panties after a single use and Sheryl Crow can afford not to eat .
It 's a bit hard to feel sorry for these millionaires when a 12 - year - old faces public scorn and thousands of dollars in fines for firing up this thing called Limewire .
In addition , the RIAA has not encouraged a diverse , healthy online music buying environment as some suggest .
Looking back over my NSA post and discussing it with some non-techie friends of mine , I can see that folks who are n't regular
Ars readers may mistake the post for some sort of defense of the administration 's spying activities .
For the record , I 'm one of those " privacy nazis " ( we used to be called " conservatives " ) that people like Michelle Malkin love to hate , and I view any kind of domestic spying automated or not with hostility .
But aside from my general knee - jerk anti-government reactions against this program , there 's an even deeper criticism that can be leveled against casting such a wide , computer - automated net .
The problem is not that such large - scale industrial fishing invariably catches a few dolphins along with the tuna , but that between 99.999 and 100 percent of what you 're going to get is dolphin .
Just imagine , for a moment , that 0.1 % of all the calls that go through this system score hits .
Now let 's suppose the system processes 2 million calls a day .
That 's still 2,000 calls a day that the feds will want to eavesdrop on a very high number , and still much higher than any courts could possibly oversee .
Furthermore , only a miniscule fraction of the overall total of 2 million calls per day on only a few days of each month will contain any information of genuine interest to the feds , and the odds that some of those calls will be among those that catch the governments interest are passing slim .
How slim , you ask ?
Here 's where the real problem with this scheme lies : the odds that a particular terrorist 's phone call will rate enough hits to sound an alarm are not primarily dependent on factors that we have control over , like the amount of processing power and brain power that we throw at the task , but on factors that we have no control over , like how good that terrorist is at hiding the content of his communication from the feds .
And when it comes to the human ability to speak in " code " so that one audience hears one thing while another audience hears another , we 're fighting millions of years of evolution .
As the TSA , with its strip - searching of people 's elderly grandparents , abundantly proves every holiday season , blunt instruments and scorched earth tactics are of dubious value in catching genuine bad actors .
In fact , blunt instruments and wide nets are the easiest for professional bad guys to evade .
All you need to beat such surveillance tools is patience and know - how .
This is true for face recognition , it 's true for biometrics , it 's true for RFID , and it 's true for every other high - volume automated technique for catching bad guys .
So what are we as a nation to do ?
Proponents of mass surveillance tactics will argue that innocent people should have nothing to hide , and that if eavesdropping on millions of innocent peoples ' phone calls prevents another 9/11 ( or worse , a nuclear attack ) then the intrusions were well worth it .
When asked just how far they 're willing to go to catch the next Mohammed Atta , they 'll answer " all the way . "
When asked how many innocent people they 're willing to see flagged by the system in order to catch that one bad guy , they 'll answer " as many as it takes . "
And thus the debate devolves into some nightmarish either - or scenario , where America has a choice between either the end of privacy or the loss of a major city to a catastrophic terrorist attack .
But it does n't have to be that way .
Targeted human intelligence has always been and will always be the best way to sort the sharks from the guppies ( to change fish metaphors ) .
Government money invested in much less intrusive and much less defense contractor - friendly programs like training more Arabists and developing more " human assets " in the field will be orders of magnitude more effective than mass surveillance could ever be .
Blunt instruments like airport facial recognition software and random subway bag searches produce much more noise than they do signal , and any engineer or computer scientist worth his or her salt will tell you that an intelligent , targeted , low - tech approach beats a brute - force high - tech approach every time .
There is no high - tech substitute for human intelligence gathering .
In fact , anyone who 's read Malcolm Gladwell 's Blink will know that an overload of crudely processed information is actually more likely to lead an analyst astray than it is to produce any useful insight .
Limited amounts of high - quality information combined with old - fashioned expertise always has been and still is the only way to sort the real from the fake , whether you 're talking about Greek statues or Al Qaeda communications .
In the end , brute force security techniques are not only corrosive to democratic values but they 're also bad for national security .
They waste massive resources that could be spent more effectively elsewhere , and they give governments and countries a false sense of security that a savvy enemy can exploit to devastating effect .
I 'll wrap this post up with a story that shows just how old , and just how ineffective , brute force " search and seizure " tactics are , even when the field has been narrowed using intelligently selected criteria .
A Greek religious text from antiquity tells of a king who got word that a potential usurper to his throne had been born somewhere in his kingdom .
He wanted to find this baby and kill it , but the unwitting human assets that he was using to lead him to the child 's location got wind of his intentions and managed to slip away .
So all the king knew was the sex of the child ( male ) , the city where the child was born , and a rough estimate of the child 's birth date .
Targeted human intelligence having failed him , he decided to try the brute force approach .
He had all the male children in that city that were two years of age or under killed .
After the slaughter of all of those infants , the king sat back in relief .
The child could never have escaped that massacre !
His kingdom was safe .
But unbeknownst to the king , his plan had n't worked .
In spite of the fact that the king had narrowed his search using perfectly sound criteria , the boy and his parents still managed to escape to Egypt , and all of those other children died for nothing .
And to top it all off , the boy Jesus was n't even a real threat to Herod 's throne .
It was a false alarm !
Herod , in his paranoia , had misinterpreted the original intelligence data as pointing to a threat , but in reality it signified no such thing ... which brings me to my final point : it 's not just enough to have sound intelligence ; you also need political leaders who have the wisdom to use that intelligence appropriately .

Major investment bank issues warning on strike against Iran
Michael Roston
Published : Monday January 15 , 2007 Print This Email This Bank sees February or March timeline if Israel strikes Warning that investors might be " in for a shock , " a major investment bank has told the financial community that a preemptive strike by Israel with American backing could hit Iran 's nuclear program , RAW STORY has learned .
The banking division of ING Group released a memo on Jan. 9 entitled " Attacking Iran :
The market impact of a surprise Israeli strike on its nuclear facilities . "
ING is a global financial services company of Dutch origin that includes banking , insurance , and other divisions .
The report was authored by Charles Robertson , the Chief Economist for Emerging Europe , Middle East , and Africa .
He also authored an update in ING 's daily update , Prophet , that further underscored the bank 's perception of the risks of an attack .
ING 's Robertson admitted that an attack on Iran was " high impact , if low probability , " but explained some of the reasons why a strike might go forward .
The Jan. 9 dispatch , describes Israel as " not prepared to accept the same doctrine of mutually assured destruction that kept the peace during the Cold War .
Israel is adamant that this is not an option for such a geographically small country .... So if Israel is convinced Iran is aiming to develop a nuclear weapon , it must presumably act at some point . "
Sketching out the time line for an attack , Robertson says that " we can be fairly sure that if Israel is going to act , it will be keen to do so while Bush and Cheney are in the White House . "
Robertson suggests a February - March 2007 timeframe for several reasons .
First , there is a comparable situation to Israel 's strike on Iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 , including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's political troubles within Israel .
Second , late February will see Iran 's deadline to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1737 , and Israel could use a failure of Iran and the UN to follow through as justification for a strike .
Finally , greater US military presence in the region at that time could be seen by Israel as the protection from retaliation that it needs .
In his Jan. 15 update , Robertson points to a political reason that could make the assault more likely  personnel changes in the Bush administration may have sidelined opponents of attacking Iran .
Preisdent Bush recently removed General John Abizaid as commander of US forces in the Middle East and John Negroponte as Director of National Intelligence , both of whom have said attacking Iran is not a priority or the right move at this time .
The deployment of Patriot missile batteries , highlighted in President Bush 's recent White House speech on America 's Iraq policy , also pointed to a need to defend against Iranian missiles .
The ING memo was first sent to RAW STORY as an anonymous tip and confirmed Monday by staff in the bank 's emerging markets office , who passed along the Jan. 15 update .
The full PDF documents can be downloaded at this link for the Jan. 9 report , and this link for the Jan. 15 update .
A screenshot of the first page is provided below .
On Monday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told Al - Arabiya that while his country would hold talks with the United States " under appropriate conditions , " the Jerusalem Post reported , but that it " would never conduct similar discussions with Israel , since it did n't recognize the Jewish state 's existence .

Verizon stock takes hit on $ 50 billion lawsuit
Lawsuit asks Verizon and government to end phone snooping and seeks $ 1,000 for each of phone company 's 50 million customers .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) - A lawsuit is asking a federal court to order President Bush , the National Security Agency and Verizon to end a secret snooping program , and Verizon 's stock took a hit on the news Monday .
Verizon ( down $ 0.36 to $ 31.43 , Research ) stock fell more than 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange early Monday .
The suit , filed Friday by two New Jersey lawyers on behalf of all Verizon subscribers , contends the phone records collection - first reported by USA Today on Thursday - violates the Constitutional right to privacy and federal law .
As a part of the snooping program , the government reportedly collects information every time a call is made on a Verizon phone line .
" The Telecommunications Act of 1934 is as clear as clear can be , " plaintiff Carl Mayer said .
" You can't turn over the records of your customers and if you do so it 's $ 1,000 per violation .
The Constitution is very clear .
The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Fourth Amendment prevents unlawful searches and seizures which we believe this to be . "
At $ 1,000 for each of Verizon 's 50 million customers , the company and government could be made to pay $ 50 billion dollars in a class action suit , Mayer said .
Verizon Communications said Friday that it could not confirm or deny whether it has provided phone records to the National Security Agency , but the company insisted it protects customer privacy and would never participate in a government " fishing expedition . "
Thursday , USA Today reported that Verizon , AT&T ( Research ) and BellSouth ( Research ) have provided the NSA with records of billions of domestic phone calls since shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
According to newspaper , the NSA does n't record or listen in on the conversations , but uses data about the calls - numbers , times and locations - to look for patterns that might suggest terrorist activity .
Mayer said the phone records database could easily be cross-checked with other databases to give the government an inside look at a citizen 's private life .
" Who amongst us wants the government snooping into who we call , whether it's a psychiatrist , your lawyer , your doctor , your clergy person , Alcoholics Anonymous , whatever , " Mayer said .
" Americans do not want this vast intrusion , this unprecedented government intrusion into their private lives . "
Mayer said the information , only collected from landline subscribers , would not provide the government any information to help national security .
" The terrorists are on the pay phones or using the prepaid phones , " he said .
" They are not on landlines so this entire exercise is another one of the administration arguments that we have to protect national security by doing something which does n't have any protection for national security . "
The lawyers will attempt to get information about the secret program through subpoenas , Mayer 's said .
" We want answers to these questions and we intend to get them , because , frankly , neither party has been aggressive enough , " he said .
" The Democrats are not being aggressive enough in standing up to this unprecedented intrusion into the private lives of Americans . "
The lawsuit said that another phone company , Qwest ( Research ) , refused the government 's request for access to the phone call data unless the NSA provided warrants issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act or a written opinion by the Attorney General that the program was lawful .
" If the CEO of Qwest Communications understands that this whole thing is illegal why do n't the CEO's of AT&T , Verizon , and the other phone companies understand that it 's illegal to be giving over private records to the government , to the National Security Agency , " Mayer said .
AT&T also released a statement saying that while it has an " obligation " to assist government agencies " responsible for protecting the public welfare , " it does so " strictly within the law and under the most stringent conditions " in order to protect customer privacy .
" Beyond that , we do n't comment on matters of national security , " AT&T said in a statement .

Stocks were decidedly mixed on Wall Street Monday .

Mr. Cheney and some of his aides have spearheaded the administration 's opposition to Senator McCain 's amendment ; they were also quick to oppose a draft of the detention directive , which began to circulate in the Pentagon in mid-September , officials said .
A central player in the fight over the directive is David S. Addington , who was the vice president 's counsel until he was named on Monday to succeed I. Lewis Libby Jr. as Mr. Cheney 's chief of staff .
According to several officials , Mr. Addington verbally assailed a Pentagon aide who was called to brief him and Mr. Libby on the draft , objecting to its use of language drawn from Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
" He left bruised and bloody , " one Defense Department official said of the Pentagon aide , Matthew C. Waxman , Mr. Rumsfeld 's chief adviser on detainee issues .
" He tried to champion Article 3 , and Addington just ate him for lunch . "
Despite his vehemence , Mr. Addington did not necessarily win the argument , officials said .
They predicted that it would be settled by Mr. Rumsfeld after consultation with other agencies .
But while advocates of change within the administration have prevailed in a few skirmishes , some of those officials acknowledged privately that proponents of the status quo still dominate the issue -- partly because of the bureaucratic difficulty of overturning policies that have been in place for several years and , in some cases , were either approved by Justice Department lawyers or upheld by the federal courts .
" A lot of the decisions that have been made are now difficult to get out of , " one senior administration official said .
A spokesman for the vice president , Stephen E. Schmidt , said Mr. Addington would have no comment on his reported role in the policy debates .
A Defense Department spokesman , Bryan Whitman , also would not discuss Mr. Waxman 's role except to say it was " certainly an exaggeration " to characterize him as having been bloodied by Mr. Addington .
Tiny formless particles in water solution take on a well - ordered and functional structure as soon as they come into contact with nanoparticles of silica .
A unique breakthrough by researchers at Linkoping University in Sweden creates new potential in medicine and biochemistry and at the same time provides a new piece of the puzzle in theories about the origins of life .
Normally , inorganic materials like silica are unwelcome in biological systems , since they disrupt the form and function of proteins .
“ We wanted to reverse the thinking and try to design proteins that take on their function only after encountering an inorganic surface , ” says Bengt - Harald Jonsson , professor of molecular biotechnology .
He directs the research team that is now presenting its findings in Angewandte Chemie .
The team designed a peptide ( a short protein ) with a specific distribution of positive charges .
The peptide was mixed into a solution of spherical silica particles , about 9 nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) across .
When the peptide was free in the solution it had no structure whatsoever , but when it connected with the negatively charged silica ball it assumed the form of a helix .
The result was a complex of a silica particle and a functional protein .
When the researchers added amino acids to their peptide , the complex took on the properties of a catalyst , a function similar to that of enzymes in living cells .
The method has several possible fields of application :
-- recognition of organic molecules
-- catalyzing of chemical reactions with precise control
-- target - seeking particles for medical uses
But the Linköping University scientists ’ successful experiment may also shed light on the eternal question of the origin of life .
Particles of clay containing silica in the ‘ primeval soup ’ may have attracted unstructured peptides with amino acids attached and given rise to the first functional proteins .
“ We know that RNA ( which plays a decisive role in the transfer of information in cells ) can bind with clay particles whose surfaces have negative charges .
The probability of peptides with amino acids having formed well - defined structures with the clay at an early stage of development is considerably greater , since they are more diversified than RNA is , ” says Bengt - Harald Jonsson .

The Ranger ’s correspondent Dave Larkin writes again , with even more remarkable imagery .
This time , instead of salted pigeons , Slovenian bees are the object of his attention .
He writes :
On the continuing breadcrumb trail the woodcut reminded me of a bee board ( front to a bee hive decorated with folk scenes ) I saw in Slovenia showing a young man fishing in a river of bathing women with a pair of trousers ( on the basis that the women want to wear the trousers ) .
Unfortunately I did n’t get a photo of this , but did find a very nice bee house in Solčavsko .
A bee house ?
Whatever is that ?
The Ranger did a bit of bee - keeping whilst at college , but never learnt of this distinctively Slovenian tradition .
Slovenia has a very long - standing bee - keeping heritage , and even its own strain of bee .
Franc Šivic , vice - president of the Bee- keepers ’ Association of Slovenia explains about the houses :
Slovenian bee - houses are unique phenomenon with their high roofs and special forms , which express a particular care and liking for the bees of our beekeepers … … the reasons [ for using these houses ] were extremely demanding and quickly changeable climate conditions , short , although sometimes abundant pastures , relief features , small space , tradition , necessity of transports to pastures and other reasons .
So these are mobile huts which are used to move bee colonies from pasture to pasture – an important ability when the season could be quite short , as is often the case on upland pastures .
Other beekeepers , too , often move hives around – but rarely in such delightful style .
Perhaps the most charming feature of these very practical constructions is the decoration – the Ranger notes that Franc Šivic does not try to explain those in terms of necessity , although actually , he could have .
See this detail that Dave provides :
On the left of the pictures can be seen a stack of four hives – each little board has a long hole above it where the bees will enter .
Each hive is a separate colony , and if you look carefully , you ’ll see that each of the charming painted pictures is also a separate hive – six of them in that stack .
Presumably the pictures also serve a very practical purpose .
One of the problems with moving hives around is that the bees need to be able to find their home again when the hive is relocated .
Bees do this by imprinting on their home visually , before they begin their flight .
You can see them do this when they first emerge – they buzz around and look at the hive .
Each hive has its own colour and illustration .
So it will be very helpful for the bees to have very distinctive colours near their own hive , preferably bright , contrasting colours … and lo and behold , this is what the traditional Slovenian bee house provides .
You looked at the picture and thought it was a cute bit of antiquated nonsense , did n’t you ?
Think again .
The Ranger wonders if anyone can provide a similar rational explanation for the gothic woodwork ..?

Roman amphora pieces abound in Pattanam
For many years , people have been in search of the almost mythical port , known as Vanchi to locals .
Much - recorded in Roman times , Muziris was a major centre for trade between Rome and southern India - but appeared to have simply disappeared .
Now , however , an investigation by two archaeologists - KP Shajan and V Selvakumar - has placed the ancient port as having existed where the small town of Pattanam now stands , on India 's south - west Malabar coast .
" It is the first time these remains have been found on this coast , " Dr Sharjan told BBC World Service 's Discovery programme .
" We believe it could be Muziris . "
Key evidence
Pattanam is the only site in the region to produce architectural features and material contemporary to the period .
" No other site in India has yielded this much archaeological evidence , " said Dr Roberta Tomber , of the British Museum .
" We knew it was very important , and we knew if we could find it , there should be Roman and other Western artefacts there - but we had n't been able to locate it on the ground . "
Muziris is located on a river , distant from Tindis - by river and sea , 500 stadia ; and by river from the shore , 20 stadia
Roman description of the location of Muziris
Drs Shajan and Selvakumar now meet locals on a regular basis as they continue their work , with some older people in particular remembering picking up glass beads and pottery after heavy rains .
Undoubtedly , they told Discovery , the many pieces of amphora are from the Mediterranean - a key to establishing Pattanam as the place where Muziris once stood .
" These amphora are so common , " Dr Shajan said .
" We have hundreds of shards of Mediterranean pottery . "
Mystery disappearance
Muziris became important because of the Romans ' interest in trading , and their desire to have contact with regions beyond the reach of conquest and set up trading routes with these places .
" India had a long fascination for the Romans , going back to Alexander the Great , " Dr Tomber said .
Glass and precious stones are key finds in the site area
What is known , from a 1st Century document , is that the harbour was " exceptionally important for trade . "
Clues to its location are provided in ancient Indian texts .
Professor Rajan Gerta , from Mahatma Gandhi University in Kerala , said that there are many references to " ships coming with gold , and going back with ' black gold ' " - pepper .
" These ships went back with a whole lot of pepper and various aromatic spices , collected from the forests , " he added .
Merchants from a number of different cultures are believed to have operated in the port , and there are numerous Indian finds from the time as well as Roman ones .
In 1983 , a large hoard of Roman coins was found at a site around six miles from Pattanam .
However , even if Muziris has been found , one mystery remains - how it disappeared so completely in the first place .
Dr Tomber said that it has always been presumed that the flow of the trade between Rome and India lasted between the 1st Century BC through to the end of the 1st Century AD , but that there is growing evidence that this trade continued much longer , into the 6th and early 7th Century - although not necessarily continually .
" We 're not quite clear how long it went on in Muziris , and the more evidence we can gather from the artefacts , the clearer the picture that will build up , " she added .
" What is interesting is that in the 6th Century , a Greek writer , writing about the Indian Ocean , wrote that the Malabar coast was still a thriving centre for the export of pepper - but he does n't mention Muziris . "

Japan ’s obsession with conservation stems from an acute sense of insecurity in a resource - poor nation that imports most its energy from the volatile Middle East , a fact driven home here by the 1970s shocks .
The guiding hand of government has also played a role , forcing households and companies to conserve by raising the cost of gasoline and electricity far above global levels .
Taxes and price controls make a gallon of gasoline in Japan currently cost about $ 5.20 , twice America ’s more market - based prices .
The government in turn has used these tax revenues to help Japan seize the lead in renewable energies like solar power , and more recently home fuel cells .
One way has been a subsidy of about $ 51,000 for each home fuel cell .
This allowed Mr. Kimura to buy his cell last year for about $ 9,000 , far below production cost .
His cell , which generates one kilowatt - hour of energy per hour , provides just under half of his household ’s electricity , and has cut his electricity bill by the same amount , he said .
The device works by converting natural gas into hydrogen , which the fuel cell then uses to generate electricity .
Heat released by the process is used to warm water .
The first two fuel cells were installed in the prime minister ’s residence in April 2005 .
Since then , some 1,300 have been sold , according to the trade ministry .
The ministry forecasts that as sales pick up , production cost will fall to about $ 5,000 by decade ’s end .
Experts say that Japan is far more willing to embrace new technologies than the United States , where opposition to hydrogen storage tanks in Tarrytown , N.Y. , forced General Motors to scrap an experimental filling station for fuel - cell cars last year .
Image Kiminobu Kimura of Tokyo uses a home fuel cell , a machine that resembles a filing cabinet and sits in front of his house .

Higher energy prices have also created strong domestic demand in Japan for more conventional and new energy - saving products of all sorts .
That has spurred the invention and development of things like low - energy washing machines and televisions and high - mileage cars and hybrid vehicles , experts say .
Japanese factories also learned how to cut energy use and become among the most efficient in the world .
Companies like Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries are now reaping the benefits in booming overseas sales of their highly efficient electric turbines , steel blast furnaces and other industrial machinery , particularly in the United States .
The environment ministry forecasts that exports will help turn energy conservation into a $ 7.9 billion industry in Japan by 2020 , about 10 times its size in 2000 .
Landlord Alan Dreja pictured at the site of a missing urinal
The man is thought to have spent 40 minutes removing the white toilet bowl after ordering half a pint at the Royal Oak pub in Southampton .
He then stuffed the urinal in a rucksack and left the pub making sure he wiped his fingerprints off the door as he went .
But his exploits were caught on CCTV and after reviewing the tape landlord Alan Dreja handed it over to police .
" It 's unbelievable , " said Mr Dreja , 46 , who has been landlord at the Royal Oak in Houndwell Place for two years .
' Professional job '
His wife Suzie Dreja added : " We were stunned as he did it at about 5 pm .
" He had wandered in and ordered half a pint of Fosters , took a few sips and went into the toilet a few times .
The suspect was captured on CCTV with a bulging rucksack
" He did a very professional job .
He turned off the stop cock and capped off the pipe .
" Our staff had thought we had taken it off for repair and it was not until the evening we noticed .
" After we realised , we looked at the CCTV and saw him go in with a flat rucksack and come out with it bulging .
He actually wiped his fingerprints off the door as he left . "
A spokesman for Hampshire police said : " It is a very unusual theft and we would like to speak to the man captured on the CCTV .
" It was clearly a very professional job , " he added .

This article is marked as ' retired ' .
The information here may be out of date and / or incomplete .
In a recent Damn Interesting Article , the villian of the Bath , Michigan Massacre left a sign stating “ Criminals are made , not born . ”
The same could possibly be said of the worst that man kind has to offer .
What makes a man ( and to be p.c. , a woman ) who his is ?
There are many deciding factors in life that influence the path chosen .
Well , these are the stories of three men who might - not - have - been .
Hitler the Artist
Before he decided to become a mass murder and generally well - hated throughout the globe ( except by strange people with a strong affinity for razors and leather ) , Hitler ’s true love was painting .
After the death of his father , he lived off of an orphan ’s pension , mom ’s help , and the paintings he sold , mostly copying scenes from postcards and selling them to merchants and tourists .
Unfortunately , he was twice denied entry into the Academy of Arts for “ lack of talent ” .
When his mother died , he gave his pension to his sister and was unable to support himself .
He ended up in homeless shelters and poor houses .
His antisemitism was born around that time and he eventually joined the army at the beginning of WWI .
The rest is history .
So what would have the world been like , had he been admitted to the prestigious school ?
I bet those snobby nose - in - the - air art directors felt bad after he was responsible for several million deaths .
Of course , who knows …even the struggling artist may have developed anti-Semitic views and joined the war in 1914 and ended up in exactly the same place .
One of the admirers of his work is the infamous Dr. “ Death ” Kavorkian which just goes to show there is no accounting for taste .
Lenin the Gymnast
Before he took part in massively bloody revolutions , became one of the founders of a major world power , and signed the death order for the disposed monarch , Nicholai II and his family , Vladimir Ilich Lenin was a student and a gymnast .
In fact he was an excellent student .
His father was a teacher and was quite liberal in his thinking ; promoting democracy and universal education .
Things came crashing down on poor Vova ’s head when his father died and the next year , his older brother ( also a superb student and also a gymnast , though they were not particularly close ) .
was executed for participation in a plot to kill Alexander III .
The family was shamed .
Vova the gymnist was no more .
Vladimir Ilich was born .
His brother ’s crime shadowed him later when he was arrested and expelled from the Kazan University for participation in student protests .
Although he and his mother wrote various authorities and royalty pleading to be let in , he was denied the second chance because of his brother .
Allegedly when after his brother ’s death , he told his sister that , “ We will not take that path . ”
Indeed he did n’t .
His fate as a revolutionary lay in the directing and slaughter of the masses .
What would have been the fate of this smart , atheletic young boy had his destiny not led him down this path .
Had his brother not been mixed up in terrorism , had he kept a low profile and not been booted out of school , what would he have been ?
Would he have been one of the aristocracy rounded up and shot by the revolution that would have happened at one point or another anyway ?
Would the communist Russia have lived so long ?
Would it have survived longer with Trotsky as the founder ?
Without Lenin , there would have never been a Stalin .
Or would he have taken the same path eventually , on his own ?
Stalin the Priest
Joseph ( Soso ) Stalin was born in Georgia to poor parents .
His mother was 16 when she was married .
She was the daughter of a serf and deeply religious .
His father was a boot maker and worked in a factory making military boots .
He was also a mean drunk .
Once when Stalin was a baby , he threw young Soso to the floor with such force that he urinated blood for several days .
Soso ’s mother finally got wise and drove her husband away .
Soso was her third child , the first two dying in infancy .
From his birth , Soso ’s mother had decided he was to become priest .
She worked long , hard hours doing anything possible to pay for books and studies .
Soso finished a spiritual college and entered into the seminary .
It was there he was caught up in the revolutionary wave , left the seminary and became eventually Stalin .
What if Stalin had learned the trade of his father ?
What if his father had not been a nasty mean drunk ?
What if he had stayed the course and become a priest like his mother wished ?
What if he had fallen out of favor with Lenin before he was powerful enough to become the “ Chief ” ?
I would make the supposition that Russia would have had a drastically different history .
There would have been more scientists , philosophers , and other of the intelligentsiya .
The red scare would not have happened .
30 million people would not have died by his orders .
The outcome of WWII could have been changed .
It ’s mind boggling to think of all that might or might not have been had any one of these men , or countless others , taken a different path in life .
For good or for evil .
Would the world we know be extremely altered , or would someone else have stood in their place , a marionette of Fate ?
Who knows .
The world is hard enought to understand without breaking my brain on this kind of jazz .

From over 220 entries in the Celebrity Mii Contest , the judges have selected their favorite celebrity avatar created with the Nintendo Wii .
And the winner is Dave Curry with his Zach Braff Mii :
Judge Spencer Sloan of Goldenfiddle said of this entry : “ What ’s beautiful about this one is the truth in this piece .
Yes , Braff , you ’re a nose and some lip .
Bravo to the artist for taking a risk . ”
Judge Jen Bekman of the Jen Bekman gallery said of the Braff : “ There is this eerily human quality - I mean it really looks like him , as a person , in a weird way . ”
The Braff Mii was not the most faithfully rendered celebrity Mii but with a few broad strokes , Curry created something more than the sum of its parts and ventured close to art .
Well done .
As the winner , Dave will receive the Wii game of his choice and a 3 - D statuette of the Zach Braff Mii provided by Fabjectory .
Here are some other entries the judges felt strongly about ( i.e. the runners - up ) with commentary :
Jack Black by both Brandon Erickson and Shane Walsh
Jen : “ Faithfully rendered . ”
Spencer : “ The artist really captured Black ’s unsettling feline qualities with confidence and skill , and for that he / she must be congratulated . ”
Condoleezza Rice by Alex Chang
Jen : “ The Condi one looks like her and also is a caricature at the same time , embodying the devil - essence that surely corrupts her soul . ”
Ruth Bader Ginsburg by Stephanie Goins
Spencer : “ This one is like the Mona Lisa .
I cannot escape her glazy stare , try as I may .
She ’s perfect in every way . ”
Woody Allen by Adam Preble
Jen : “ Great , immediately recognizable , somewhat of an easy target though . ”
Frida Kahlo by Adriana Tatum
Vito Corleone by Benjamin Lim
Jen : “ Don Corleone came close to being my top pick before I decided that he too , was a bit too easy . ”
Steve Zissou by Mark Husson
Spencer : “ Nice work on the hat , I guess , but the moustache is weird .
Plus , no pock marks .
And Stevie definitely needs him a frown . ”
Admiral Ackbar by Eric Eberhardt and Mike Boccieri
Spencer : “ Admiral Ackbar is fantastic , obviously , because I immediately knew who he was , and maybe you did n’t .
I ’m interested to find out whether the artist went in with Ackbar in mind or saw him in some of the available features .
Very well done , indeed . ”
Klaus Nomi by D.J. Ross ’ girlfriend
Spencer : “ The Klaus Nomi is a strong work but possesses little confidence .
This Klaus is all fear .
More timid mime than weirdo alien swagger . ”
And here are the rest of the finalists that the judges had to choose from .
You may notice a few excellent cartoon entries … the judges felt that while they were worthy finalists , they did not merit the top spots because of a lower degree of difficulty involved in their construction ( i.e. making a cartoon character with what is essentially a cartoon editor ) .
From top to bottom , left to right : Velma from Scooby Doo , Hannibal Lecter , Jack Skellington from A Nightmare Before Christmas , Dick Cheney , Tom Cruise , Hulk Hogan , Jennifer Wilbanks ( aka The Runaway Bride ) , George Costanza , Charlie Brown , and V from V for Vendetta .
Missing from the finalists are the multiple Michael Jacksons , Hitlers , Satans , Walter Sobchaks , Beatles , and Kim Jong Ils .
So many Mii versions of all these people exist online that it did n’t feel right including them in the final round because they were both too easy and too easily copied from elsewhere .
Finally , a personal favorite that did n’t make it into the final round :
David Foster Wallace by Nick Maniatis
I get the feeling that in the Maniatis household , there are a lot of Wii Tennis matches pitting Wallace and Hal Incandenza against Tracy Austin and Michael Joyce .
Awesome .
Thanks to everyone who entered and to the judges for deciding amongst such a strong field of entrants .

Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully in Ten Minutes
by Mike Shea on 8 May 2006
The following is an excerpt of an excellent article by Stephen King .
You can learn much more about Stephen King 's writing style in his book On Writing , a Memoir of the Craft .
" THAT'S RIGHT .
I know it sounds like an ad for some sleazy writers ' school , but I really am going to tell you everything you need to pursue a successful and financially rewarding career writing fiction , and I really am going to do it in ten minutes , which is exactly how long it took me to learn .
It will actually take you twenty minutes or so to read this essay , however , because I have to tell you a story , and then I have to write a second introduction .
But these , I argue , should not count in the ten minutes . "

This seminar course will study advanced techniques in functional programming and has three major goals :
To learn the best techniques used by functional programmers , so you can use them in your own work .
To learn how to read , summarize , and criticize papers so you can write better papers yourself .
To get a feel for research questions in functional programming .
Topics
There is no fixed set of topics and participants can actually suggest papers , but here is a list of possible topics :
The basics of Haskell , a pure , lazy language
Monads
Haskell type classes vs. ML functors
Functional Pearls : clever algorithms and data structures
Debugging functional programs ( tools and techniques )
Generic Programming
Type Systems
Implementation of functional languages
Advanced Talks on Wednesday , March 22
All talks in this seminar will be given on Wednesday , March 22 , in a conference - like setting .
The location is Room 528/ 45 .
If you are interested in the talks but not a member of this seminar , please send us an email ( see below ) .
Each talk will be 25 minutes long , followed by a discussion .
Below is our tentative schedule .
Final Papers
Each talk was accompanied by a short written presentation .
These are available as a single PDF ( 1 MB ) file :
What to expect
Most seminars hand students a bunch of papers and ask them to prepare a presentation towards the end of the semester .
This seminar is different : we will read , discuss , and criticize papers together .
The seminar is organized in two phases .
During the first phase we will read papers , typically one or two per week .
This includes writing assignments and some programming exercises when appropriate .
At each meeting we are discussing the papers we have read ; this may include group work where we try to answer specific questions about a paper .
In the second phase each participant prepares a presentation for one or two papers that we have n't read collectively but that are related to papers that we have read .
This is accompanied by a short written presentation .
The overall experience of the seminar will be a bit like a class in school with exercises , discussion , and group work , albeit on a different level .
Expect to work for the seminar one full day per week .
Organization
During the semester , we meet every Tuesday at 4:00 - 5:30 pm in room 528/45 .
You will receive 8 or 9 credit points for successful participation , depening on your Prüfungsordnung .
Amount of work : about 10 hours per week ( for 12 weeks ) .
Evaluation ( with results ! )
How are we doing ?
We really want to know and have prepared some questions .
Your answers are anonymous but you can fill out the form only once .
For this you need a token that we hand out in the course .
Besides your answers to specific questions your general comments about this course are most valuable to us .
Thanks everybody for participating !

Adam and Eve said , " Lord , when we were in the garden , you walked with us every day .
Now we do not see you any more .
We are lonesome here , and it is difficult for us to remember how much you love us .
" And God said , " No problem !
I will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you , so that you will love me even when you can not see me .
Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be , this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do , in spite of yourselves .
" And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve .
And it was a good animal .
And God was pleased .
And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his tail .
And Adam said , " Lord , I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal .
" And God said , " No problem .
Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you , his name will be a reflection of my own name , and you will call him DOG .
" And dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and loved them .
And they were comforted .
And God was pleased .
And dog was content and wagged his tail .
After a while , it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said , " Lord , Adam and Eve have become filled with pride .
They strut and preen like peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration .
Dog has indeed taught them that they are loved , but perhaps too well .
" And God said , " No problem !
I will create for them a companion who will be with them forever and who will see them as they are .
The companion will remind them of their limitations , so they will know that they are not always worthy of adoration .
" And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve .
And cat would not obey them .
And when Adam and Eve gazed into cat 's eyes , they were reminded that they were not the supreme beings .
And Adam and Eve learned humility .
And they were greatly improved .
And God was pleased .
And Dog was happy .
And Cat did n't give a shit one way or the other .
There has been a raging debate ( just watch Reddit ! ) on static vs dynamic typing and programming language choice these days .
Most participants seem honest enough to point out the advantages and disadvantages of each typing scheme — dynamic typing requires less grunt “ typing ” work but is significantly less “ safe ” than static typing — but do n’t account for the flexibility of typing usage available to each language .
While from a strict definitional viewpoint static and dynamic typing are quite disjoint — type checking is either done at compile - time or left for runtime — there are quite a few intermediate schemes .
Some languages ( Visual Basic , IIRC ) allow for Variant data types , for example ; Haskell ’s own take at this seems to be Data .
Dynamic , but I do n’t really know for sure .
There is , moreover , even in a language disallowing variant data types , a spectrum of typing strategies that runs from no-pasaran typeful programming to just exploiting cartesian products and sums from machine types .
Say you want to represent pixels in an infinite - sized 2D display ; let us explore some ways of specifying that .
Military typing : Horizontal coordinates and vertical coordinates are really quite different types of information and should not ever be used in one single calculation .
Therefore , we first have to define these coordinate types .
data XPos = XP Int
data YPos = YP Int
Now we can define a pixel as the cartesian product of these types : data Pixel = Pixel XPos YPos
Writing functions for this rather indirect type will require somewhat messy pattern matching : up ( Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y ) ) = Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y+1 )
down ( Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y ) ) = Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y - 1 )
addpos ( Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y ) ) ( Pixel ( XP x ' ) ( YP y ' ) ) = Pixel ( XP ( x+x ' ) ) ( YP ( y+y ' ) )
etc .
If you wanted to do something strange like adding x and y coordinates , you ’d have to go out of your way to define wacky ( XP x ) ( YP y ) = ( XP x+y )
You ca n’t even overload (+ ) , since its type is (+ ) :: ( Num a ) => a -> a -> a and therefore we ca n’t add values of different data types even if we attempt to declare XP and YP as instances of Num .
This is both a gift and a curse .
What strong typing brings in to the table is that you ca n’t mess with the intuitive semantics of (+ ) — you ca n’t beat the proverbial wisdom to the effect that you ca n’t add apples and oranges .
On the other hand , it ’d sure be nice to have a general “ lift ” combinator that took functions from Ints and turned them on functions on XP or YP , etc — which you can’t , because such a function would n’t be typeable short of defining a WrappedInt class and doing away with the whole benefit of military typing .
Instead , you have to live with liftX f ( XP n ) = XP ( f n )
liftX2 f ( XP n ) ( XP n') = XP ( f n n ' )
liftX3 f ( XP n ) ( XP n ') ( XP n'' ) = XP ( f n n' n'' )
liftY f ( YP n ) = YP ( f n )
liftY2 f ( YP n ) ( YP n ' ) = YP ( f n n' )
liftY3 f ( YP n ) ( YP n ' ) ( YP n'' ) = YP ( f n n' n'' )
addpos ' ( Pixel x y ) ( Pixel x ' y ') = Pixel ( liftX2 (+ ) x x ' ) ( liftY2 (+ ) y y ') liftXY f ( Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y ) ) = Pixel ( liftX f x ) ( liftY f y )
liftXY2 f ( Pixel ( XP x ) ( YP y ) ) ( Pixel ( XP x ' ) ( YP y ' ) ) =
Pixel ( liftX f x x ' ) ( liftY f y y')
-- ... not to mention the combinatorially explosive number
-- of ways functions can be lifted to two coordinates
-- ( only to X , only to Y , one function to X another to Y... ) ...
addpos '' = liftXY2 (+ ) which is more general , but also requires more documentation .
Binder typing : Military typing requires a Big Design Up Front .
It also requires an army of programmers writing functions on coordinates and pixels .
It helps enforce security , but is a major headache as well ; if you ’re not going to war , you might want to go with something weaker .
A first “ weakening ” of the pixel specification is data Pixel = Pixel Int Int
Pattern - matching for this type becomes cleaner : up ( Pixel x y ) = Pixel x y+1
down ( Pixel x y ) = Pixel x y-
1
addpos ( Pixel x y ) ( Pixel x ' y ') = Pixel ( x+x ' ) ( y+y ' )
The endless cascade of “ lift ” functions becomes quieter as well : liftXY f ( Pixel x y ) = Pixel ( f x ) ( f y )
liftXY2 f ( Pixel x y ) ( Pixel x ' y ') = Pixel ( f x x ' ) ( f y y')
addpos ' = liftXY2 (+)
What is lost here is that the compiler no longer knows that X - coordinates and Y - coordinates are different things .
New , wide avenues for human error are opened , but we may often consider that the price tag of military typing is not worth the benefits — we want to trust our programmers and end - users at least a little bit .
Binder typing with tabs :
An interesting syntactic variation of binder typing is obtained through the use of a record .
A record type is identical in functionality to the cartesian product type defined above ( you can even use the same functions , without any rewriting ) , except in that it creates “ destructor ” functions automatically by act of declaration : data Pixel = Pixel { hor :: Int , ver :: Int }
This allows us to rewrite the functions above ( which , again , still work with this record type ) in a different , possibly less messy fashion : up p = Pixel ( hor p ) ( ( ver p ) +1 )
addpos p p' = Pixel ( ( hor p ) + ( hor p ' ) ) ( ( ver p ) + ( ver p ' ) )
What has happened in effect is that the data declaration creates new functions hor :: Pixel ->
Int and ver :: Pixel ->
Int which can be used to break down the product type .
In some cases , this makes the semantics of functions more transparent .
liftXY f p = Pixel ( ( f . hor ) p ) ( ( f . ver ) p )
liftXY2 f p p' = Pixel ( ( f. hor ) p p ' ) ( ( f . ver ) p p ' )
If we define a constructor function we might be able to bypass pattern - matching altogether : point x y = Pixel x y
liftXY f = lift M2 point ( f . hor ) ( f . ver )
All this , of course , is unnecessary if one ’s willing to muck about with pattern - matching , and is only mentioned for the sake of ooh ahh .
U.S. astronomers have discovered a planet unlike any other known in the universe .
Smithsonian scientists say the new planet was discovered using a network of small automated telescopes known as HATl .
The planet -- designated HAT - P - 1 -- orbits one member of a pair of distant stars 450 light - years away in the constellation Lacerta .
" We could be looking at an entirely new class of planets , " said Gaspar Bakos , a Hubble fellow at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
With a radius about 1.38 times that of Jupiter , HAT - P - 1 is the largest known planet .
But , in spite of its huge size , its mass is only half that of Jupiter .
" This planet is about one - quarter the density of water , " Bakos said .
" In other words , it 's lighter than a giant ball of cork !
Just like Saturn , it would float in a bathtub if you could find a tub big enough to hold it . "
Astronomer Robert Boyes , co-discoverer of the planet , said , " This new discovery suggests something could be missing in our theories of how planets form . "
Bakos is lead author of a paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal describing the discovery .

Comment
It 's hard to imagine now , but there was a time when the mainstream press was barely acquainted with the genius and foresight of today 's technology leaders .
Fifteen years ago Bill Gates appeared on the BBC's Wogan show - which the Beeb thought of as a nightly Johnny Carson , but which was really like watching Regis Philbin on cough syrup - to show off his WinPad PC .
The wooden Gates made a joke about making his money disappear , with only a couple of clicks , using only a stylus .
As Gates blinked , a nation which had never heard of Microsoft , and could n't quite figure out why the guy in glasses was n't singing or dancing , looked on in sympathetic embarrassment .
But Gates 's prime time TV appearance underscored one point , popular in the public prints at the time , which was that a nerdish , upstart technology was changing the very foundations of the world as we know it .
Microsoft was simply smarter , more agile , more cunning , and far more darkly mysterious than the fusty incumbents , like IBM , could ever realize .
To stand in the way of Microsoft was to stand in the way of youth , innovation and progress itself .
Now , it may puzzle you as much as it puzzles us that this idea ever gained popular currency - let 's save that discussion for another day .
But it can't have escaped your notice that this mythical struggle has been reprised by the inkies several times - in the mid-1990s with Netscape - and today with the phoney war between Microsoft and Google .
If you 're of the view that history repeats itself the second time round as farce , then the parallels are even more uncomfortable .
Today , Microsoft is a software monopoly that equally , is barely acquainted with its own methods of production .
The last Microsoft engineer who worked on the original incarnations of Windows left an engineering capacity at the company a long , long time ago and , as a consequence , a company that once could turn on a sixpence and drop off an OS refresh that seriously screwed a competitor now takes seven years to eke out an update .
Insulated by the comfortable monopoly position it enjoys , Microsoft today is n't even in control of Microsoft .
But then again , why does it have to worry ?
Now fast forward to 2006 , where Google , if we 're to believe the popular prints , is simply smarter , more agile , more cunning , and far more darkly mysterious than its incumbents can fathom .
Or , er , is it ?
When Google unleashed PageRank™ on the world , it really created a monster .
Google was so proud of its algorithm that it liked to boast that it mirrored the " inherent democracy " of the internet , a phrase which coyly and insidiously , flatters us all .
PageRank™ was a truer representation of life than we ever realized , Google said , if only we cared to look .
The trouble is , PageRank only worked within a small dataset of peer reviewed academic journals .
To extrapolate this into a way of life , as Google 's dreamy maths - obsessed boy wonders tried to do , was an essentially utopian gesture , which supposed that no one would try and game the system to their own nefarious ends .
Only the inevitable happened , and as Google got more popular , and as the value of appearing in those top spots increased , Google gradually lost control of the algorithm which was once its muse .
At the time , we remember , we gained very few plaudits for documenting this weary process - as Google was gradually gamed by desperate trinket salesmen , who built link farms to tout their wares - and by technology evangelists , who mistook overnight popularity for a validation of a lifetimes 's achievement .
All were to fall to earth eventually , as technology offers no short cuts or backdoors when the calculations are finally made .

Over the last year , I 've often been asked my thoughts on the re-emergence of the barter / swap business model .
I thought it might be useful to share my perspective here .
Back in the Web 1.0 days , we saw the rise and fall of the barter / swap business model with companies such as WebSwap , Switchouse , Swap.com , SwapVillage , Mr. Swap , etc ) .
These sites received tens of millions of dollars from well known VCs but none of them were able to gain traction or survive the fallout .
It might be my false pride , but I believe that consumers were more attracted to person - to - person fixed price sites ( such as Half.com and Amazon Marketplace ) where they could swap their CDs / DVDs / Books for cash .
As Forbes magazine wrote in 2000 : “ It took humans thousands of years to emerge from the barter system .
Does bringing it back online make sense ? ”
It seems that with the emergence of Web 2.0 we now have a rush of companies looking to take up where the others left off .
Over the last few months we ’ve seen the emergence of Lala , Zunafish , Barterbee along with Peerflix.com .
Further support for Om 's argument that Web 2.0 is Web 1.0 all over again .
In fact , last week ’s New York Times article on Zunafish looks remarkably similar to the one they ran almost six years earlier .
All of these new sites are looking to build a barter / swap - based business model .
However , the Web 2.0 barter sites represent a meaningful advance from the Web 1.0 barter sites .
Rather than force users to conduct a two - way swap ( ie , User A has something that User B wants AND user B has something that User A wants ) they ’ve introduced a point system ( or alternate form of currency ) to allow users to conduct one - way swaps ( ie , User A gives something to User B for 4 points – and User B can get something from user C for those points ) .
Users pay a standard fee ( typically $ 1 ) to make a trade .
The currency / point model is a significant improvement .
Users can now get something without having to find someone who wants something from them .
Recent blog posts have compared the efficacy of this new model to the cost of buying / selling used goods .
However , I ’m still not convinced that a swap / barter marketplace is as effective as a cash marketplace .
I spent some time tonight looking at the currency value of DVD ’s on Peerflix .
Specifically , I compared the used price of several DVDs on Half.com to their Peerbux price – and found the values to be highly disproportional .
( I chose Half.com since it is a liquid marketplace that places a dollar value on used DVD ’s – and since I founded it – but the analysis holds in Amazon Marketplace as well )
For example , you can get both the Fourth and Fifth Season of the Sopranos on Peerflix for 10 Peerbux each .
However , on Half.com you can currently buy the Fourth Season for $ 29.99 and the Fifth Season for $ 38.00 .
That means that there is an eight dollar price difference between two DVDs worth the same number of Peerbux .
So a user who gives away their Fifth Season Sopranos for 10 Peerbux is not just paying a $ 1 swap fee – they are leaving another $ 8 on the table .
Moreover , Peerflix users can buy Peerbux for $ 5 each .
So , if you wanted to get the Fourth Season of the Sopranos on Peerflix by purchasing Peerbux , you ’d be paying $ 50 – or $ 20 over market value .
Badda bing !
I selected a total a ten DVDs and then computed the implied cash value of a Peerbuck ( by dividing the price on Half.com by the price in Peerbux ) .
I was surprised to see that the price of 1 Peerbuck ranged from $ 0.95 all the way to $ 9.30 .
This has two consequences .
First , it creates a “ winner ” and a “ loser ” in every trade .
In a true marketplace , both sides of the transaction get a fair deal .
However , if you “ sold ” your copy of 24 ( Season Two ) or Murder by Death on Peerflix you did not get as good as deal as someone who “ sold ” their Lord of the Rings or Bad News Bears .
By using a point system instead of real dollars , these marketplaces hide the true cost of the trade -- and are always putting 50 % of their users at a financial disadvantage .
Second , people will want to keep the good DVDs they have , while they 're willing to trade the bad ones ( via Techdirt ) .
This creates a real arbitrage opportunity .
I went on Peerflix and listed several of the low value items for trade ( Lord of the Rings , The Terminal , Sopranos Fourth Season , Bad News Bears ) .
If I get an order , I ’ll go to Half.com and have the DVD ’s shipped to the Peerflix customer … then I ’ll use my new Peerbux to buy Murder by Death or 24 ( Second Season ) – and then sell those on Half.com .
It should be an interesting experiment – I ’ll keep you informed …
Starry Night LEGO Mosaic
Spring 2001
In the Spring of 2001 , I created a large mosaic of one of my favorite paintings , Van Gogh 's Starry Night .
The mosaic is made completely out of LEGO bricks and measures 45 " ( 144 studs ) wide by 36 " ( 116 studs ) tall .
It took several months and approximately ten thousand bricks to complete .
This is what the mosaic looked like immediately before I hung it up on my wall .
Most of the mosaic is on six 15 " square base plates , with three smaller 6 " × 15 " plates along the bottom .
You can see several of my Blue Tubs as well , filled with sorted bricks waiting for my next project ; whatever that may be .
I started this project with only four Blue Tubs , each of which comes with 1,200 pieces , and quickly needed to buy four more .
These are the first two 15 " × 15 " panels hung up on the wall .
I started with the center panel and worked my way across to complete the top row , then worked my way down row by row .
A Technic plate at the center of each baseplate in the top row supports that plate and the others below it .
Three panels -- the entire top row of the mosaic -- are now hung and the whole thing has n't come crashing down yet .
Oh , did I mention that no glue whatsoever was used on this project ?
Only the connectivity of LEGO bricks , and three screws , keeps this mosaic together and in place on my wall .
Here 's the completed image , together for the first time .
The whole mosaic weighs about fifteen to twenty pounds , but I 'm guessing at that number .
A tighter shot , and you can clearly see the many individual bricks that make up the image .
I only used the standard red , blue , yellow , white , black and green colored bricks when putting this together .
A still tighter shot .
I 'd guess that about half of the bricks I used for this project were 1×1 bricks .
Although the Blue Tubs provided most of the bricks I needed , I quickly ran out of both green and black 1×1s -- there are only twelve green 1×1s per Blue Tub and I needed hundreds .
Then I discovered the joys of ordering parts on BrickLink .
There 's no way I would have been able to finish this project without BrickLink .
Borrowing a technique from Eric Harshbarger , I used plates to raise up some of the bricks along the bottom of the image to spell out " Van Gogh 1889 / Hall 2001 " .
It 's difficult to see the lettering in this photo though , but trust me , the words really are there . =)
Finally , here 's a shot of the guide I used when putting this all together .
I got a clear , non-clipped image of the painting and tweaked it in Photoshop until I had the dithered image I needed .
Then it was simply ( ! ) a matter of putting the right bricks in the right places .
Now all I have to do is figure out what my next mosaic is going to be ... =)

Exclusive titles like Gears of War have helped Xbox 360 sales
The report by media analysts Screen Digest said that the complexity of next generation games made it hard for publishers to cover production costs .
Long development times and large production teams also affected profitability , the report found .
Sequels to popular games or those based on films are now the focus , it added .
The report models sales forecasts for next generation games until 2010 .
Its author Ed Barton told the BBC News website that many games publishers were choosing to release the same game across as many different hardware platforms as possible to access the widest possible user base .
Exclusive deal
But while some publishers seek to spread their games appeal across many platforms , at least one hardware manufacturer is basing its strategy on exclusivity .
Sony has scaled up its own internal development resource , basically becoming one of the largest makers of gaming content on the planet
Ed Barton , Screen Digest
Microsoft has adopted a policy of forging relationships with third party publishers to produce games exclusively for the Xbox 360 , a strategy which may involve making financial assurances to publishers .
" It 's hard to see how anyone would commercially agree to that without a relatively substantial payment to mitigate the risk of that game being only on a single platform , " said Mr Barton .
However , it seems the strategy is beginning to pay off with the success of exclusive titles like Epic 's Gears of War for Xbox 360 .
Sony 's strategy is based on the belief that sales of consoles are based on the number and quality games available for the hardware .
" Sony has scaled up its own internal development resource , basically becoming one of the largest makers of gaming content on the planet , " said Mr Barton .
Sony now employs more than 2,000 development staff across 14 studios worldwide .
With the Wii Nintendo is focusing on game play innovation to attract a wider range of consumers , a strategy which has proved very successful for the company 's handheld DS platform , said Mr Barton .
Some industry figures believe that despite mounting costs , games publishers who can adapt to changes in the market will not only survive , but flourish .
Paul Jackson , the head of the UK's Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association ( Elspa ) , said games publishers are under threat " only if they are not ready to move up a gear " .
" The UK is a very successful place to be a games producer , " said Mr Jackson .
" We have come out of every technology change stronger and I do n't anticipate this transition to be any different . "
A new UK survey shows a dramatic increase in the use of picture messaging with WAP also growing in popularity .
The results of a survey conducted by mobile media company Enpocket and Harris Interactive for Q4 2005 show that 36 % of mobile owners now use their phones to send and receive picture messages , up from 21 % at the same period last year .
MMS usage levels have soared over the last year amongst the tech - savvy 18 - 34 age group , and doubled in all age groups above 34 years old .
With easy headlines in mind , these studies always like to break the figures down by sex , so we can tell you that women are more keen on using MMS , with 40 % using the medium compared to just 33 % of blokes .
When it comes to seeking mobile information online , it ’s the geezers who are keenest to get their keypads rattling , with 38 % accessing mobile Internet ( WAP ) sites compared to 26 % of ladies .
Overall , a third of all mobile users are ready and willing to get WAP’ing , with the technology becoming mainstream amongst 18 - 24 year olds ( 61 % saying they had recently used the mobile internet ) and increasingly popular with 25 - 34 year olds ( 50 % ) .
“ Mobile as a communications medium is getting richer and a lot more exciting , ” said Mike Baker , President and CEO , Enpocket , before going on to plug his company with gusto ( we ignored that bit ) .
Elsewhere , the Mobile Data Association have calculated that WAP page impressions are now approaching the 2 billion per month mark , with the Mobile Media Monitor revealing the most popular types of site on the mobile internet .
Not surprisingly , those infernal ringtone sites are the most popular with 48 % of WAP surfers visiting one or more in the last three months , followed by news sites ( 41 % ) , games sites ( 36 % ) , sports sites ( 33 % ) , entertainment sites ( 31 % ) and weather sites ( 28 % ) with just 6 % seeking small screen titillation from adult sites .

A man who was fed up with paying massive bank charges decided to give one of the high street
giants a taste of its own medicine .
When Royal Bank of Scotland refused to refund £ 3,400 charges that Declan Purcell believed he was owed , he sent in the bailiffs .

The end of free banking ?
Daily Mail 's Fair Play on Charges
How to reclaim bank charges
Stunned customers at his branch of RBS watched as debt collectors seized four computers , two fax machines and a till filled with cash .
The branch manager was told that the items would be sold unless RBS came up with the money owed to Mr Purcell .
Only when the manager gave an undertaking that the debt would be paid did the bailiffs leave .
Mr Purcell said : " I think the bank was
pretty shocked when the bailiffs went in .
But my view is that this is exactly what
they would have done to me . "
The move , which will raise a cheer from
millions of other bank customers , is part of a consumer fightback against bank charges , which net an estimated £ 4.5 billion every year .
Every time a current account customer goes overdrawn by as little as £ 1 most banks will charge around £ 28 , even though the administration cost is only about £ 4.50 .
Then every cheque , direct debit , or card transaction that goes through or is bounced incurs another charge of up to £ 38 .
The Office of Fair Trading is investigating
whether banks have implemented these charges unlawfully .
The Daily Mail 's Fair Play on Charges campaign and that run by the Consumer Action Group have helped thousands reclaim charges in the past year .
Like other customers Mr Purcell , 48 , from East London , had warned his bank that he was prepared to go to court to claim back charges he believes were imposed unlawfully .
In June last year he demanded the refund of £ 3,400 charges he accrued during the previous six years while running a motorcycle dealership .
RBS ignored the claim so in October Mr Purcell filed an online application to get the money back through the county court .
After 30 days the bank had not responded and so on December 10 the court ruled in Mr Purcell 's favour .
It ordered RBS to pay the charges and £ 120
court costs .
When RBS again failed to respond Mr Purcell got the court to give him a warrant of execution , allowing him to order debt collectors to reclaim items from the bank equal in value to the amount he was owed .
Finally on Monday , January 8 , a team of debt collectors walked into the busy Camden Town branch in North London , demanded to see the manager , showed their court order and announced that they were repossessing items .
Mr Purcell , who now works for London Underground , said : " I was dismayed by the bank's
reaction when I made my claim for a refund – it was so rude and arrogant .
" They thought they were above the law , so it is great to know that customers can use the law in the same way the bank does to get money they
are owed . "
A spokesman for RBS said : " We are looking into this as a matter of urgency , but early
indications suggest that unfortunately due to an
administrative error , the bank failed to defend the claim leading to a default judgment being obtained on the branch and a resulting
warrant .
" The confusion was cleared up at the branch . "
Marc Gander , who set up campaign website Consumer Action Group , which helps consumers get refunds from their banks , said : " I am quite sure that Mr Purcell will not be the last person to send bailiffs in to his bank .
" The continued operation by UK high street banks of their unlawful charges regimes will see to that .
" The heavy - handed debt collecting approach is something that the banks have been handing out to their customers for years .
Mr Purcell simply gave them a bit of their own back . "

What is Cog­ni­tive Reserve ?
The con­cept of a cog­ni­tive reserve has been around since 1998 when a post mortem analy­sis of 137 peo­ple with Alzheimer ’s Dis­ease showed that the patients exhib­it­ed few­er clin­i­cal symp­toms than their actu­al pathol­o­gy sug­gest­ed .
( Katz­man et al. 1988 ) They also showed high­er brain weights and greater num­ber of neu­rons when com­pared to age - matched con­trols .
The inves­ti­ga­tors hypoth­e­sized that the patients had a larg­er “ reserve ” of neu­rons and abil­i­ties that off­set the loss­es caused by Alzheimer ’s .
Since then the con­cept of cog­ni­tive reserve has been defined as the abil­i­ty of an indi­vid­ual to tol­er­ate pro­gres­sive brain pathol­o­gy with­out demon­strat­ing clin­i­cal cog­ni­tive symp­toms .
Despite many stud­ies that demon­strate an asso­ci­a­tion between high­er par­tic­i­pa­tion in more intel­lec­tu­al , social and phys­i­cal activ­i­ties and more reserve , most of these stud­ies were not done over a long enough time peri­od to rule out whether the stim­u­lat­ing activ­i­ties were pro­mot­ing high­er cog­ni­tive per­for­mance or high­er per­form­ers were more like­ly to engage in stim­u­lat­ing activ­i­ties .
The lon­gi­tu­di­nal stud­ies show a mutu­al­ly rein­forc­ing cycle between an ini­tial­ly high intel­lec­tu­al func­tion­ing per­son , an engaged lifestyle , and more cog­ni­tive reserve , but also a main­te­nance of intel­lec­tu­al per­for­mance .
( Arbuck­le et al .
1992 , Gold et al .
1995 , Hultsch et al 1999 , Schaie 1984 , Schaie 1996 , School­er and Mulatu 2001 )
In one study of 1772 non­de­ment­ed indi­vid­u­als over sev­en years that con­trolled for fac­tors like eth­nic group , edu­ca­tion , and occu­pa­tion , par­tic­i­pants with high leisure activ­i­ty had 38 % less risk of devel­op­ing demen­tia , and that risk was reduced by approx­i­mate­ly 12 % for each addi­tion­al leisure activ­i­ty adopt­ed .
( Scarmeas , Levy , et al . 2001 ) Lat­er stud­ies , includ­ing imag­ing stud­ies of cere­bral blood flow , con­tin­ue to build up data show­ing fre­quent par­tic­i­pa­tion in cog­ni­tive­ly stim­u­lat­ing activ­i­ties reduces risk for Alzheimer ’s and slows the rate of cog­ni­tive decline .
Inter­est­ing­ly , phys­i­cal , social , and intel­lec­tu­al activ­i­ties all help , although intel­lec­tu­al activ­i­ties were asso­ci­at­ed with the low­est risk of inci­dent demen­tia .
Fur­ther­more , it has been shown that peo­ple with high cog­ni­tive reserve decline more rapid­ly , sup­port­ing the idea that the pathol­o­gy is more advanced by the time it is clin­i­cal­ly appar­ent .
( Stern , Tang , et al. 1995 )
Causal­i­ty
The asso­ci­a­tion between engaged lifestyle and demen­tia risk could be either medi­at­ed or con­found­ed by abil­i­ties like IQ or edu­ca­tion .
If this is the case then it could be that either IQ or edu­ca­tion rep­re­sent the true causal links with demen­tia or that sub­jects with high­er IQ or edu­ca­tion tend to adopt lifestyles which them­selves causal­ly reduce the risk of demen­tia ( such as exer­cise , diet , etc. ) .
Nev­er­the­less , in stud­ies where edu­ca­tion and occu­pa­tion ( Scarmeas et al. 2001 ) or edu­ca­tion and IQ ( Scarmeas et al. 2003 ) were con­trolled for , the asso­ci­a­tion between leisure activ­i­ties and demen­tia risk was still there .
Oth­er pos­si­bil­i­ties are that high func­tion­ing and engaged lifestyle are results of an innate capac­i­ty .
Or per­haps bor­der­line demen­tia patients are less active as a result of the pathol­o­gy .
Or per­haps the con­nec­tion has yet to be found .
How Does it Work ?
If it is a causal rela­tion­ship , there are four pos­si­ble expla­na­tions of how it might work :
Par­tic­i­pa­tion in stim­u­lat­ing activ­i­ties spurs neu­ronal growth and a larg­er num­ber of neu­rons to com­pen­sate for the pathol­o­gy High activ­i­ty peo­ple use the same num­ber of neur­al net­works more effi­cient­ly High activ­i­ty peo­ple use alter­nate neur­al net­works more effi­cient­ly to com­pen­sate for the pathol­o­gy
The fac­tors that affect cog­ni­tive reserve dis­rupt the devel­op­ment of the dis­ease pathol­o­gy by decreas­ing neu­rode­gen­er­a­tion

Research
Why men are attracted to subordinate women
Men are more likely to want to marry women who are their assistants at work rather than their colleagues or bosses , a study finds .
The study , published in the current issue of Evolution and Human Behavior , highlights the importance of relational dominance in mate selection and discusses the evolutionary utility of male concerns about mating with dominant females .
" These findings provide empirical support for the widespread belief that powerful women are at a disadvantage in the marriage market because men may prefer to marry less accomplished women , " says Stephanie Brown , lead author of the study and a social psychologist at the Institute for Social Research ( ISR ) .
For the study , supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health , Brown and co-author Brian Lewis from the University of California , Los Angeles tested 120 male and 208 female undergraduates by asking them to rate their attraction and desire to affiliate with a man and a woman they were said to know from work .
" Imagine that you have just taken a job and that Jennifer ( or John ) is your immediate supervisor ( or your peer , or your assistant ) , " study participants were told as they were shown a photo of a male or a female .
After seeing the photo and hearing the description of the person 's role at work in relation to their own , participants were asked to use a 9 - point Likert scale ( 1 is not at all , 9 is very much ) to rate the extent to which they would enjoy going to a party with Jennifer or John , exercising with the person , dating the person and marrying the person .
Brown and Lewis found that males , but not females , were most strongly attracted to subordinate partners for high - investment activities such as marriage and dating .
" Our results demonstrate that male preference for subordinate women increases as the investment in the relationship increases , " Brown says .
" This pattern is consistent with the possibility that there were reproductive advantages for males who preferred to form long - term relationships with relatively subordinate partners .
" Given that female infidelity is a severe reproductive threat to males only when investment is high , a preference for subordinate partners may provide adaptive benefits to males in the context of only long - term , investing relationships not one - night stands . "
Brown , who is affiliated with the ISR Evolution and Human Adaptation Program , says the current findings are consistent with earlier research showing that expressions of vulnerability enhance female attractiveness .
" Our results also provide further explanation for why males might attend to dominance - linked characteristics of women such as relative age or income , and why adult males typically prefer partners who are younger and make less money . "

Story Highlights • Detainees seen " chained hand and foot ... with no chair / food / water "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI on Tuesday released documents showing at least 26 of the agency 's employees witnessed aggressive mistreatment and harsh interrogation techniques of prisoners by other government agencies or outside contractors at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
" On several occasions witnesses saw detainees in interrogation rooms chained hand and foot in fetal position to floor with no chair / food / water ; most urinated or defecated on selves and were left there 18 , 24 hours or more , " according to one FBI account made public .
One FBI witness saw a detainee " shaking with cold , " while another noted a detainee in a sweltering unventilated room was " almost unconscious on a floor with a pile of hair next to him ( he had apparently been pulling it out through the night ) . "
Another witness saw a detainee " with a full beard whose head was wrapped in duct tape . "
One FBI statement said that an interrogator squatted over the Quran and that a German shepherd dog was ordered to " growl , bark and show his teeth to the prisoner . "
Another detainee was draped in an Israeli flag .
The FBI surveyed all 493 FBI personnel who had been assigned to the military prison facility in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and determined no FBI agent or support personnel had participated in any of the controversial practices .
" This thorough internal assessment shows the FBI was not involved in these activities in any way , " said chief FBI spokesman Richard Kolko .
The FBI Office of General Counsel in September 2004 ordered the " special inquiry " into any FBI participation or observations of a series of alleged incidents at the prison camp for suspected terrorists and al Qaeda sympathizers , but the results were not made public .
The FBI released the documents in response to a Freedom of Information request by the American Civil Liberties Union , but stressed that most of the findings had already been reported elsewhere .
" Note these documents have been vetted by both DoD [ Department of Defense ] and FBI , and that FBI believes this or substantially similar information has already been released in this litigation , " the FBI said .
Results of the 26 " positive responses " and several more " not purely negative responses " reported by FBI personnel in the internal inquiry were made available Tuesday on the Web site at www.FBI.gov.
( Read the report )
Other actions FBI personnel reported either witnessing or being told about included :
Placing a detainee in a darkened cell with the intent of interrogating him for 24 hours straight ; the witness reported being told that then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had approved this technique .
Keeping detainees awake for days on end with strobe lights and loud music .
Dressing as a priest and " baptizing " a detainee .
Subjecting a detainee to a lap dance by a topless female guard .
Interrupting detainees ' attempts to pray by putting fluid on their faces and telling them it was menstrual blood .
Beating a detainee who said he had recently undergone abdominal surgery .
First , can I draw your attention to the title .
It says " Things to consider " .
Not " How to " or " What not to do " or " ... for Dummies " .
I 'm not trying to be pushy here , I 'm not about to tell you which name to choose for your kids , or that you absolutely CANNOT choose certain names .
That would be stupid .
I 'm simply going to draw your attention to some aspects of name - choosing that might sway your decision ; aspects which , if overlooked , could lead to a decision you ( or , more importantly , your child ) might regret .
Discard the advice if you wish , but at least consider it .
I have the horrible feeling that despite this disclaimer , I will still end up offending or at least inadvertently insulting a lot of people .
Apologies to anybody who finds this personally offensive - I would never make fun of anybody 's name .
Others , however , would .
That 's the point .
Check all the obvious abbreviations .
Do the initials spell a word out ?
A friend of a friend was going to call her child Claire Oona Willis , until she thought better of it .
I also know a JIM .
We call him Jim .
Jim does n't seem to mind this , but a different person might take offence at it .
Then there 's Catherine Penn : " Cat Pee " .
Check the pronunciation .
Timothy Muggli abbreviates nicely to " Tim Muggli " i.e. " Tim Ugly " .
Are there people in your family with the same initials ?
Two people in a friend 's household had the initials ABM .
They were forever opening each other 's mail .
This is particularly tricky if two children have the same initials .
( In an adult - child situation , it 's easier , of course .
Only one of the two is likely to receive bank statements , for example . )
Remember that you will have to shout this name in public .
When your kid misbehaves , or runs off , you 're gonna have to run after him and shout his name .
Can you imagine doing this with a child whose first name is Phoenix ?
Or Galadriel ?
Look it up .
Some names may sound very pretty and feminine or masculine , but when you find the nearest word to Morticia in the dictionary I daresay you may think otherwise .
A friend of a friend was considering the name " Placenta " .
Check the gender .
Seriously .
Check the spelling .
Can you imagine going through life constantly correcting other peoples spelling of your name , because they got it right and your parents did n't ?
Another friend teaches a girl named Tarnya .
Not the more correct " Tanya " with a long " aa " .
Tarnya .
Check the pronunciation .
Another friend of a friend wanted to call her child " Wye - vonnie " .
The name she actually wanted was " Yvonne " , pronounced " ih - VONN " .
These last four apply even if you 're absolutely certain .
You may be surprised to find that a name you thought was commonplace is actually totally fictional .
Consider diminutive forms .
Billy is okay for a child , but would it be appropriate to call an adult man " Billy " ?
A pensioner ?
If you call your child Richard , he will be called " Dick " at some point in his life , whatever you do .
This is n't grounds for ruling out the name , but is definitely worth considering .
If you name your child after somebody else who lives in the same house , confusion will reign .
" Hi , can I speak to Frank , please ? " or maybe " Frank !
Come to the kitchen ! " are just two of the many possible situations in which you might regret naming your son Frank after Frank .
Making
Frank the kid 's middle name might be a better possibility .
The longer the name is , the fewer standardised forms you can fit it on .
There are a whole lot of forms you and your child will end up filling in over the course of your lives , and many of them will only provide space for a limited number of characters .
Having to use an extra sheet for your name - or to include all three middle names - can be demoralising .
Some names have been changed .
Puneet Nanda StoryPuneet Nanda was like many parents :
He could n't get his five - year - old daughter to brush her teeth properly .
But unlike most parents , Nanda is a toothbrush manufacturer with an irrepressible entrepreneurial drive .
Knowing that his daughter was fascinated by her sneakers with flashing lights , he ripped the lights out of her shoes and put them on a toothbrush .
That did n't work , so " I went to Disneyland that evening and bought everything that lit up , " says Nanda , now 38 .
The second prototype was more successful .
His daughter brushed for a good two minutes before asking : " Dad , will this ever stop , or should I brush my teeth off ?
" Bingo .
Nanda added a timer so the light would blink for exactly a minute , and the Fire Fly toothbrush was born .
The brightly colored Fire Fly -- the newest version sports a see - through handle showing off a tiny toy and a bunch of floating glitter -- is making a name for Dr. Fresh , Nanda 's Buena Park ( Calif . ) company and his medical school nickname .
In 2004 , Nanda got the original Fire Fly into Target , and by 2005 it was bringing in 20 % of the 50 - employee company 's $ 25 million revenues .
Nanda , who holds 58 patents , is seizing on the success of the Fire Fly to create other dental products with flashing lights .
" I 'm building brand equity , " says Nanda .
" If I have to do something I have to do it the best . "
He already has a foothold with more conventional wares , such as private - label dental floss sold nationally in Walgreens and Target stores .
Nanda 's path to dental success has n't been easy .
The New Delhi native left medical school to join the family toothbrush business in 1989 , after his father had a heart attack .
Two years later he began hawking toothbrushes to Russians who'd come to India looking for products to sell back home .
Nanda moved to Russia in 1993 , leaving his wife and son in India and selling toothbrushes out of a warehouse .
He soon felt unsafe doing a cash business in Russia and returned to India for 18 months before heading to New York .
Having little luck in New York , he tried Los Angeles , where he landed a $ 180,000 contract with a 99 cents store .
" I 'd never seen that big of a deal , " says Nanda , who then moved his family to L.A. Nanda knew he needed something clever to grow in an industry dominated by heavyweights such as Colgate - Palmolive and Procter & Gamble .
The Fire Fly may do the trick .
It initially flopped at Walgreens , so Nanda began selling it directly to dentists he met at conferences .
" The flashing light encourages kids to brush a little longer , " says San Francisco pediatric dentist Bergen James , who gives it to her patients .
" It gets children to brush , and it gets them excited about it .
" The positive feedback from dentists encouraged Nanda to recommit to direct sales .
He hired 40 women in India to call dental offices in the U.S. and pitch the Fire Fly .
And he kept knocking at Target 's door , a company he'd been pitching since 2001 .
Once Target took it , Walgreens was willing to give the Fire Fly another try .
Nanda now spends more than half his time ginning up new ideas .
Next up : mouthwash and toothpaste with kid-friendly add - ons .
If all goes well , that may turn Dr. Fresh into a big company with a lot of flash .

I have a love - hate relationship with innerHTML .
On the one hand , it ’s proprietary .
It ’s certainly not part of the W3C DOM .
It ’s also not very subtle .
It takes a single argument — a string — and bungs it into an element , regardless of whether the string contains valid or even well - formed markup .
It ’s a lot safer ( although more time - consuming ) to use DOM methods like createElement , createTextNode and appendChild .
On the other hand , innerHTML is very well - supported .
In fact , it enjoys better cross - browser support than some official DOM methods and properties .
Does this make it a de-facto standard ?
Possibly .
People are already paving the cowpaths with innerHTML when it comes to Ajax .
See the AHAH microformat , for instance .
It ’s a super - simple way of taking the responseText property of the XMLHttpRequest object and slapping it into a specified part of a page .
It ’s the very essence of Ajax : updating a portion of a page instead of refreshing the whole page .
That ’s pretty similar to the way I ’ve built most of my Ajax apps so far .
Using a proprietary property like innerHTML does make me feel slightly dirty .
I justify its use by telling myself that XMLHttpRequest is also proprietary , which is true .
There ’s no way to make Ajax work without making some sort of Faustian pact with non-standard technologies … non-standard in the strictest sense , anyway .
But there ’s a specific situation where innerHTML can let you down .
If you serve up your XHTML with an XML mime - type , you ca n’t use innerHTML .
If you want your documents to be treated as XML , you ’ll have to forego the convenience of HTML - specific properties like innerHTML .
Or at least that was the case .
Firefox 1.5 has just been released .
Among the many changes made to the browser , it now supports the use of innerHTML even on XHTML documents .
Maybe it ’s time I worked out my “ issues ” with innerHTML .
It looks like it ’s here to stay .
I just hope it does n’t lead me down a slippery slope to document .

In the beautiful - irony department , I have just learned that my name
and copyright now appears in the EULA ( End- User License Agreement ) of
a Microsoft product .
A vector - graphics editor called “ Microsoft
Expressions ” , apparently — thanks to Martin Dawson for the
tip .
The history behind this is that GIFLIB is open - source software for
hacking GIF images — the direct ancestor of libungif , which is
the name under which the codebase is more widely known these days .
The original software was by Gershon Elber for DOS ; around 1987 I
ported it to Unix , cleaned up the architecture , added numerous new
features , and wrote documentation .
When Unisys started to jump salty
about the GIF patents in the mid-1990s , I handed the project off to a
maintainer outside U.S. jurisdiction , Toshio Kuratomi .
I have no idea why the copyright on this EULA is dated 1997 , I
think that is a couple of years after I passed the baton to Toshio
Kuratomi .
Subsequently I did a lot of work on libpng , implementing 6 of the
14 chunk types in the PNG standard and designing a new more
object - oriented interface for that library .
So if you use open - source
software that handles either of the two most popular raster - image
formats , it is rather likely that you rely on my code every day .
Yes ,
that includes all you Firefox and Netscape and Konq and Safari users
out there .
And now , my code is in a Microsoft product .
This may not be the
first time ; in fact , thinking about all the other places it would
have been silly for Microsoft to pass up using libpng and giflib ,
it probably is n’t even the dozenth time .
I ’m OK with this , actually .
I write my code for anyone to use , and
‘ anyone ’ includes evil megacorporate monopolists pretty much by
definition .
I would n’t change those terms retroactively if I could ,
because I think empowering everyone is a far more powerful
statement than empowering only those I agree with .
By doing so , I
express my confidence that my ideas will win even when my opponents
get the benefit of my code .
Besides…now , when Microsoft claims open source is inferior or not
innovative enough or dangerous to incorporate in your products or
whatever the FUD is this week , I get to laugh and point .
Hypocrites .
Losers .
You have refuted yourselves .
DNA by design ?
Officially the teaching packs are frowned on
Chemistry teacher at Liverpool 's Blue Coat School , Nick Cowan , says the packs promoting intelligent design are useful in debating Darwinist evolution .
Education officials insist intelligent design is not recognised as science .
It argues that evolution cannot explain everything so the Universe must have had an intelligent creator .
The packs were sent out to 5,000 secondary schools by a group of academics and clerics known as Truth in Science .
The Department for Education and Skills said they were inappropriate and not supportive of the science curriculum .
There 's a sense that if you criticise Darwin you must be some kind of religious nut case
Nick Cowan
Former head of chemistry at Blue Coat School , Liverpool
Reacting to Mr Cowan 's letter , a DfES spokesman said : " Neither creationism nor intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools , and are not specified in the science curriculum .
" The National Curriculum for science clearly sets down that pupils should be taught that the fossil record is evidence for evolution , and how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction . "
The call from Mr Cowan - former head of the school 's chemistry department - comes as the Guardian reported that the Truth in Science materials were being used in 59 schools .
' Sacred cow '
Mr Cowan says they are " very scholarly " and could be extremely useful in helping children understand the importance of scientific debate
He told the BBC : " Darwin has for many people become a sacred cow .
" There 's a sense that if you criticise Darwin you must be some kind of religious nut case .
" We might as well have said Einstein should n't have said what he did because it criticised Newton . "
He argues that science only moves forward by reviewing and reworking previous theories and that these materials foster an understanding of this .
' Controversy '
He also points out that the Truth in Science materials , which he describes as outstanding , do not mention creationism or even God .
This is quite frankly a distraction that science teachers can well do without
Phil Willis , Commons science and technology committee
" The government wants children to be exposed to scientific debate at the age of 14 or 15 .
" All the Truth in Science stuff does is put forward stuff that says here 's a controversy .
" This is exactly the kind of thing that young people should be exposed to , " Mr Cowan added .
' Poorly served '
The chairman of the parliamentary science and technology committee , Phil Willis , said using the packs in science classes " elevated creationism " to the same level of debate as Darwinism and that there was no justification for that .
He added : " There 's little enough time with the school curriculum to deal with real science like climate change , energy and the weather .
" This is quite frankly a distraction that science teachers can well do without . "
Dr Evan Harris , honorary associate of the National Secular Society and Liberal Democrat science spokesman , said it was worrying that some schools were giving " this nonsense " any credence .
Many leading scientists argue that ideas about intelligent design should not be allowed in school because they are simply not scientific .
Back in April , the Royal Society warned against allowing creationism in school saying that pupils must understand that science backs Darwin 's theory of evolution .
The society 's statement said : " Young people are poorly served by deliberate attempts to withhold , distort or misrepresent scientific knowledge and understanding in order to promote particular religious beliefs . "
Recently , the British Humanist Association asked Mr Johnson for greater clarity on the teaching of creationism in schools .
Three Rules for Foreign Tourists at Three Gorge Dam
( The Mac Weekly )
An afternoon in a Chinese cop shop : Wang and Von Geldern recount story of arrest .
By Angela Whited .
November 3 , 2006 .
According to Wang and Von Geldern , the officials attempted to make them confess to a crime they had not committed while the professors insisted they were only tourists .
They spent most of their time negotiating about words .
“ One of them put together protocol of an interrogation that never took place to exonerate us , ” Von Geldern said .
“ He wrote it out , we signed it , and they let us go .
The whole thing took two to three hours . ”
Needing to pass the time , Wang made conversation with the policeman .
“ Ping ’s a very gifted interviewer , ” Von Geldern said .
“ She so completely charmed this policeman , I do n’t think he knew what was going on . ”
She learned that the arresting officer had grown up on the Russian border with his parents who were from the Three Gorges area .
He ’d moved back to the area to become a cop when his parents retired .
“ He [ the policeman ] knew some Russian poems and started reciting , ” Wang said .
Since Von Geldern was a foreigner — Wang is a Chinese national — they had to wait for the customs officials to arrive before proceedings could begin .
The afternoon dragged on and the professors were growing tired and had n’t eaten .
“ Jim ’s hand was shaking and trembling , ” Wang said .
“ I think the cop was worried something bad would happen [ to Jim ] and he would get in trouble . ”
“ The guy goes out and orders noodles and serves us tea while we wait , ” Von Geldern said .
Wang said she thought the policeman who arrested them was just following orders .
“ At the beginning he was very serious , but he lightened up after a while , ” she said .
“ He said we were being arrested for violating the law that forbade us from talking to migrants , ” Von Geldern said .
“ I asked what that law was , and he did n’t know . ”
“ Both of us have spent a lot of time in socialist countries and have been arrested times before , ” Von Geldern said .
“ Ping knew exactly what we needed to do . ”
“ I hid my notebook and memory cards under the taxi driver ’s seat , ” Wang said .
“ When we got out I took a few shots at random .
The cop made me erase the card . ”
“ I knew immediately they were going to take my camera , ” Wang said .
Unwilling to forfeit so significant a portion of her research on the trip , Wang and Von Geldern switched the memory card in the camera to a blank one while driving to the police station .
Finishing their business around 1 p.m. , the professors climbed into their rented car and started the slow trek up the side of the valley .
They were almost out when the police cruiser roared past and cut them off .
“ Our driver , for some reason , in this little putt - putt car , was trying to outrun them , ” Von Geldern said .
Wang ’s ongoing research project deals with the changing face of the Chinese countryside and the farmers who live there .
She has told and continues to tell their stories through her writing and photographs .
Naturally , she took pictures of the villagers that day .
“ It was probably the photos that got us in trouble , ” Von Geldern said .
Rumors of human rights violations in the relocation process of about one million people necessary for the completion of the dam project had brought the Macalester professors to the Three Gorges area of China .
Wang , an English professor , and Von Geldern , a Russian professor , were speaking to one man , already three days past his eviction date , who refused to leave the house his grandfather built , when they drew a small crowd of unhappy people .
Just a week before China ’s Three Gorges Dam became operational on June 6 , Seminar Coordinator Mike Monahan and International Studies Dean Ahmed Samatar received a phone call in Shanghai from Professors Jim Von Geldern and Wang Ping : “ We ’re being arrested .
Do n’t worry .
We ’ll check in every half hour .
If we do n’t , something ’s wrong . ”
( ObserveChina ) Foreign Tourists Must Observe Three Rules While Traveling in Three Gorge .
By Wang Weiluo ( 王维洛 ) .
November 23 , 2006 .
[ in translation ]
I remember Mr. Yu Qiuyu once wrote an essay in which he recommended that the most worthwhile place for foreign tourists to see in China is Three Gorges .
Ever since the Chinese government approved the Three Gorge Dam construction project , the travel agencies in China began to promote the " Farewell to Three Gorge tour " all over the world .
The number of foreign tourists visiting the Three Gorge area increased to new historical heights .
But ever since the Three Gorge Reservoir began to store water since June 2003 , tourism has gone down even as the water level in the reservoir has gone up .
The newly ordered luxury cruise boats are parked at the docks due to lack of tourists .
Many upscale luxury hotels are idle and many Three Gorge travel agencies in Chongqing city have gone out of business .
In order to reverse the downturn in Three Gorge Dam tourism , the Chinese travel industry has offered many attractively priced Three Gorge tours on the international market .
Due to the good prices , some foreign tourists have come .
But for foreign travel agencies , there is the important issue of traveler safety that is more than just about prices .
A while ago , the cruise ship Galaxy 2 carrying 85 German and Swiss tourists went aground on the way from Yichang to Chongqing .
The cruise ship hit a reef and began to take in water .
Although all the tourists were safe , the incident generated bad publicity .
In addition , foreign tourists have to be reminded about the special laws in the Three Gorge Dam area -- they have to observe the three regulations .
You must not talk to migrants displaced by the Three Gorge project
You must not mention anything related to the relocation of these migrants
You must not take any photographs related to the relocation of the migrants .
If foreign reporters want to enter the Three Gorge Dam area , they must first obtain special permission from the Hubei provincial or Chongqing municipal government foreign affairs departments .
The purpose is to prevent foreign reporters from interviewing migrants from the Three Gorge Dam area " privately " without the permission of the Chinese national , Hubei provincial and Chongqing municipal governments and without the escort of government officials .
But when foreign tourists go to the Three Gorge Dam area , they do not need special permission from the Hubei provincial or Chongqing municipal government foreign affair departments .
In a sense , they were attracted to come here because China gave them an attractive offer .
But when one goes to tour a place , the scenery is only part of the trip .
More important is the understanding of the people , their customs and culture .
This means coming into contact with the local residents and asking them about their lives .
For western tourists , the relocation of the migrants displaced by the Three Gorge Dam project is an interesting subject .
In their minds , they already know about the relocation problems for the migrants displaced at places such as Egypt 's Aswan Dam .
They really want to know how the Chinese government relocated so many residents while improving their living conditions .
But the Chinese national , Hubei provincial and Chongqing municipal government only want these foreign tourists to come to Three Gorge and leave their money behind for this smokeless industrial development .
They do not want the foreign tourists to get involved in matters " unrelated to tourism , " such as understanding the issues about the relocation of people .
They want the foreign tourists to observe the " three regulations " carefully -- do n't talk to migrants displaced by the project , do n't talk about any issues related to relocation and do n't take any photographs related to the relocation .
But it is difficult to make the " free and undisciplined " foreign tourists observe the regulations , and this is therefore causing problems for the travel agencies .
A short while ago , two professors at Macalester College ( Minnesota , USA ) Jim von Geldern and Wang Ping traveled to Three Gorge and they conversed with migrants displaced by the dam project .
They also took some photographs .
As a result , they were detained by the local public security bureau .
They were told that they had violated the law forbidding conversation with relocated migrants and that was why they were detained .
The two American professors were forced to wipe out the photographs on the memory cards in their cameras .
The public security bureau staff interrogated them and made them sign a statement .
Then the two were released .
Jim von Geldern and Wang Ping wrote in the statement : " We are tourists .
We promise to remain tourists and ask no questions . "
On November 3 , 2006 , the MacWeekly published at Macalester College published an article titled " An afternoon in a Chinese cop shop : Wang and von Geldern recount story of arrest . "
The article recounted the experience of the two teachers while under detention .
The Chinese government showcased the Three Gorge project as one that demonstrates the " superiority of socialism . "
An important research topic at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences is the relationship between the Three Gorge Dam residents and human rights in China .
" We are tourists .
We promise to remain tourists and ask no questions . "
These two short sentences constitute the biggest satire about the Three Gorge Dam that is supposed to showcase the superiority of socialism as well as the situation of human rights in China .
Tourists tour because they have curiosity .
Without this sort of curiosity , there is no motive to go on a tour .
When tour guides finish the description of a place , they usually ask : " Do you have any questions ? "
How can a tourist be a proper tourist without asking questions ?
What is human rights ?
The right to speak and ask questions should be the most basic human right !
Can a country in which questions are now allowed possibly be called a country with human rights guaranteed by democratic rule of law ?
I wish that the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences would include in their Three Gorge migrant / human rights research an analysis about how the law " forbidding foreigners from talking to Three Gorge migrants " is an example of human rights with unique Chinese characteristics .
After the research report is completed , the two American professors should be invited to provide the concluding opinion .
When the Three Gorge Dam began to take over control of the water flow in the Changjiang river on November 8 , 1997 , Jiang Zemin told the whole world : " From ancient times , the Chinese people have engaged in grand projects to conquer , develop and utilize nature .
The stories of Jingwei filling the sea with pebbles , Yugong leveling the mountain and Dayu stopping the floods by regulating the flow of water illustrate how the ancient Chinese believed in the ability of humans to fight and win against nature .
Water control projects such as Dujiangyan and the Sui-dynasty canal were constructed more than 2,000 years ago and had great impact on economic and social development in that era .
Today , we are building a water and electricity engineering project that is the world 's largest in terms of size and total combined benefits .
This will have a tremendous stimulating effect on the economic development of our people .
This is a project that will benefit us and our descendants for ages .
It shows the enterprise spirit of the Chinese people and their great desire to continuously improve their lot .
It shows the magnificent will to change our world during the reform process . "
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the Three Gorge project once again showed the superiority of socialism in being able to amass the forces necessary for grand projects .
In the case of Three Gorge , the superiority of socialism is being shown in the ability to relocate more than 1 million people to make way for the dam .
In a capitalist society , this is indeed impossible .
Someone has calculated that 1.13 million persons were displaced for the Three Gorge dam .
This number is larger than the population in many European countries .
You must agree that this is a major achievement .
Apart from China , what other country in the world would dare to undertake such a project ?
But something that a capitalist society cannot do and only a socialist system can do is not necessarily a good thing .
That such a dam is not possible under the capitalist system shows that there are reasons for not being able to do so , and not because the system is either capitalist or socialist .
In the letter from Huang Wanli to Jiang Zemin , none of the reasons why Three Gorge Dam should not be built is connected to the socialist system .
There is a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer in Asia where people smoke heavily , which may be accounted for by high consumption of tea , particularly green tea , according to a review article published by a Yale School of Medicine researcher .
" We do not yet have a full explanation for the ' Asian paradox , ' which refers to the very low incidence of both heart disease and cancer in Asia , even though consumption of cigarettes is greater than in most other countries , " said Bauer Sumpio , M.D. , professor and Chief of Vascular Surgery in the Department of Surgery .
" But we now have some theories . "
Sumpio , the lead author of the review in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons , said he and his colleagues reviewed more than 100 experimental and clinical studies about green tea in writing the article .
He said one theory is that the average 1.2 liters of green tea consumed daily by many people in Asia offers the anti-oxidant protective effects of the polyphenolic EGCG .
EGCG may prevent LDL oxidation , which has been shown to play a key role in the pathophysiology of arteriosclerosis .
EGCG also reduces the amount of platelet aggregation , regulates lipids , and promotes proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells , which are all factors in reducing cardiovascular disease , he said .
Sumpio said other reports show that EGCG prevents growth of certain tumors .
Tea , according to studies , also can improve gastrointestinal function , alcohol metabolism , kidney , liver and pancreatic function , protect skin and eyes and alleviate arthritis .
Tea has been used in managing and preventing allergies , diabetes , bacterial and viral infections , cavities , reduce or cure diseases with an inflammatory component and improve neurologic and psychological health .
" More studies are necessary to fully elucidate and better understand green tea's method of action , particularly at the cellular level , " Sumpio said .
" The evidence is strong that green tea consumption is a useful dietary habit to lower the risk for , as well as treat , a number of chronic diseases .
Certainly , however , smoking cessation is the best way to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer . "

Oral Sex in Accordance with God's Will
Since the publication of our original article on anal sex and God ’s will , we have received several inquiries asking to clarify God ’s position concerning oral sex .
We are gratified that so many Christians are hungry for the word of the Lord and are actively seeking the Truth so that they may fulfill His plan in all areas of their lives .
The Good News About Oral Sex
Like anal sex , oral sex is the subject of much confusion and disagreement among the faithful .
There are those who say that oral sex is unnatural because God did not intend our mouths to be used in such a manner .
Others associate oral - genital contact with the sexual depravities of Sodom and Gomorrah .
As you will see in the Scripture , neither one of these views is supported .
Not only that , but oral sex has benefits that are of particular importance to Christians : oral sex allows the natural prevention of unwanted pregnancy and is an alternative to premarital intercourse for those committed to preserving their chastity before marriage .
There is nothing in the Bible that forbids engaging in acts of oral - genital contact .
Oral sex has wrongly been grouped in with “ sodomy ” and the sexual sins of Sodom and Gomorrah .
As we have seen with anal sex , this argument does not hold water , because the sins of the Sodomites were specifically homosexual and / or nonconsensual in nature .
There is no way this could be extrapolated to argue against a heterosexual act of oral sex for mutual pleasure .
On the other hand , the Bible does contain some favorable references to oral sex , some in poetic language and some more explicit .
“ His Fruit Was Sweet to My Taste ”
In Christian discussions concerning oral sex , the Song of Solomon is most frequently cited as an example of scriptural allusion to the act :
Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest , so is my beloved among the young men .
In his shade I took great delight and sat down , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
( Song of Solomon 2:3 )
While the previous passage refers to fellatio , the following can be read as a metaphor for cunnilingus :
Awake , O north wind , and come , wind of the south ; make my garden breathe out fragrance , let its spices be wafted abroad .
May my beloved come into his garden and eat its choice fruits !
( Song of Solomon 4:16 )
And again , the Song of Solomon urges lovers to eat and drink freely of one another ’s bodies : I am come into my garden , my sister , my spouse : I have gathered my myrrh with my spice ; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey ; I have drunk my wine with my milk : eat , O friends ; drink , yea , drink abundantly , O beloved .
( Song of Solomon 5:1 )
This reading of the scriptures portrays the act of oral sex as both natural , like eating , and a joyful expression of love , passion , and sexual sharing between a man and woman .
In the New Testament , this passage directs partners to render “ benevolence ” to one another , which can be extended to performing oral sex on each other as part of their duty to the Lord and one another :
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
( Corinthians 7:33 )
Not only does this passage imply that oral sex between a man and woman is acceptable and desirable , but as we shall see , the Bible also provides more specific edicts concerning the completion of the oral sex act , namely swallowing the male emission .
The Necessity of Swallowing - The Sin of Spilling Seed
Most of us are familiar with the Biblical story of Onan , whose sin against God was that of spilling his seed on the ground :
And Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD : wherefore he slew him also .
( Genesis 38:9 )
This scriptural passage has traditionally been used as an injunction against masturbation .
However , upon closer reading , it becomes apparent that this scenario has nothing to do with masturbation at all .
Onan was not masturbating ; he was copulating with his brother ’s wife ( and there was a good reason for that , in God ’s plan ) .
His sin was pulling out ( coitus interruptus ) and ejaculating on the ground rather than into the woman .
He did so in order to avoid impregnating her .
However , he could have easily avoided God ’s wrath ( and the penalty of death ) , by simply having the woman fellate him and then swallow his semen .
This would have kept him from impregnating her , as well as completely prevented the spilling of seed that was an offense in God ’s eyes .
The extreme case of Onan aside , how bad is it in general to spill semen ?
The Old Testament ranks it with other acts of uncleanliness that meet with God ’s disapproval :
And if any man 's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
17 And every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
( Leviticus 15:16 - 17 )
Getting ejaculate on oneself or one ’s clothing results in uncleanness that requires extensive reparations and atonement .
Obviously one simple way to prevent the spillage of semen is to have your partner perform fellatio and swallow the emission .
In fact , in light of these scriptures , performing fellatio to completion and then spitting out the resulting emission seems almost unthinkable .
The Benefits of Swallowing - Drink of the Living Water
Aside from swallowing semen as a measure to prevent the waste and spillage of seed , ingesting ejaculate can have spiritual benefits , as we will see .
Although the Old Testament makes reference to the bitterness of semen ( And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water .
[ Numbers 5:24 ] ) , the New Testament casts the act of consuming ejaculate in a much more affirming light , as in the following passage , where Jesus speaks to the woman of Samaria about the gift of “ living water ” :
Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God , and who it is that is saying to you , " Give me a drink , ' you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . "
11 The woman said to him , " Sir , you have no bucket , and the well is deep .
Where do you get that living water ?... 15 The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water . "
16 Jesus said to her , " Go , call your husband , and come back . " ( John 4:10 - 16 )
“ Living water ” in this context refers to semen , which literally is the liquid of life .
As Christ indicates , drinking of the “ living water ” provides a spiritual replenishment for the soul .
When the woman asks Jesus where she can get this “ water ” , he tells her to fetch her husband , clearly with the intention of instructing her on how to fellate him and swallow his semen .
Oral Sex in Christ
In summary , we can say that the Scripture supports and even encourages the act of oral sex between loving heterosexual partners .
Moreover , the Bible specifically encourages fellatio to completion ( orgasm ) with the female partner consuming or swallowing the ejaculate .
This prevents spilling seed , which is an affront to the Lord , and also provides spiritual benefit to the receiving partner .
Oral sex has the added benefits of preventing unwanted pregnancies and helping couples satisfy their sexual urges while preserving their chastity until marriage .
For these reasons , all Christian men and women should feel confident and comfortable including oral sex as part of their sexual life in accordance with God ’s will .

Reporting for Newsnight
The Bush administration made plans for war and for Iraq 's oil before the 9/11 attacks , sparking a policy battle between neo-cons and Big Oil , BBC's Newsnight has revealed .
Iraqi-born Falah Aljibury says US Neo-Conservatives planned to force a coup d'etat in Iraq
In fact there were two conflicting plans , setting off a hidden policy war between neo-conservatives at the Pentagon , on one side , versus a combination of " Big Oil " executives and US State Department " pragmatists " .
" Big Oil " appears to have won .
The latest plan , obtained by Newsnight from the US State Department was , we learned , drafted with the help of American oil industry consultants .
Insiders told Newsnight that planning began " within weeks " of Bush 's first taking office in 2001 , long before the September 11th attack on the US .
We saw an increase in the bombing of oil facilities and pipelines [ in Iraq ] built on the premise that privatisation is coming
Mr Falah Aljibury
Mr Aljibury himself told Newsnight that he interviewed potential successors to Saddam Hussein on behalf of the Bush administration .
Secret sell - off plan
The industry - favoured plan was pushed aside by a secret plan , drafted just before the invasion in 2003 , which called for the sell - off of all of Iraq 's oil fields .
The new plan was crafted by neo -conservatives intent on using Iraq 's oil to destroy the Opec cartel through massive increases in production above Opec quotas .
Former Shell Oil USA chief stalled plans to privatise Iraq 's oil industry
Mr Ebel , a former Energy and CIA oil analyst , now a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , told Newsnight he flew to the London meeting at the request of the State Department .
Mr Aljibury , once Ronald Reagan's " back - channel " to Saddam , claims that plans to sell off Iraq 's oil , pushed by the US - installed Governing Council in 2003 , helped instigate the insurgency and attacks on US and British occupying forces .
" Insurgents used this , saying , ' Look , you 're losing your country , you 're losing your resources to a bunch of wealthy billionaires who want to take you over and make your life miserable , ' " said Mr Aljibury from his home near San Francisco .
" We saw an increase in the bombing of oil facilities , pipelines , built on the premise that privatisation is coming . "
Privatisation blocked by industry
Philip Carroll , the former CEO of Shell Oil USA who took control of Iraq 's oil production for the US Government a month after the invasion , stalled the sell - off scheme .
Mr Carroll told us he made it clear to Paul Bremer , the US occupation chief who arrived in Iraq in May 2003 , that : " There was to be no privatisation of Iraqi oil resources or facilities while I was involved . "
Amy Jaffee says oil companies fear a privatisation would exclude foreign firms
He advocated the plan as a means to help the US defeat Opec , and said America should have gone ahead with what he called a " no- brainer " decision .
Mr Carroll hit back , telling Newsnight , " I would agree with that statement .
To privatize would be a no - brainer .
It would only be thought about by someone with no brain . "
New plans , obtained from the State Department by Newsnight and Harper 's Magazine under the US Freedom of Information Act , called for creation of a state - owned oil company favoured by the US oil industry .
It was completed in January 2004 under the guidance of Amy Jaffe of the James Baker Institute in Texas .
Formerly US Secretary of State , Baker is now an attorney representing Exxon - Mobil and the Saudi Arabian government .
View segments of Iraq oil plans at www.GregPalast.com
Questioned by Newsnight , Ms Jaffe said the oil industry prefers state control of Iraq 's oil over a sell - off because it fears a repeat of Russia 's energy privatisation .
In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union , US oil companies were barred from bidding for the reserves .
Ms Jaffe says US oil companies are not warm to any plan that would undermine Opec and the current high oil price : " I 'm not sure that if I 'm the chair of an American company , and you put me on a lie detector test , I would say high oil prices are bad for me or my company . "
The former Shell oil boss agrees .
In Houston , he told Newsnight : " Many neo conservatives are people who have certain ideological beliefs about markets , about democracy , about this , that and the other .
International oil companies , without exception , are very pragmatic commercial organizations .
They do n't have a theology . "
A State Department spokesman told Newsnight they intended " to provide all possibilities to the Oil Ministry of Iraq and advocate none " .
Greg Palast 's film - the result of a joint investigation by Newsnight and Harper 's Magazine - will be broadcast on Thursday , 17 March , 2005 .
Newsnight is broadcast every weekday at 10.30 pm on BBC Two in the UK .

Preface
Most of the GNU Emacs integrated environment is written in the programming language called Emacs Lisp .
The code written in this programming language is the software — the sets of instructions — that tell the computer what to do when you give it commands .
Emacs is designed so that you can write new code in Emacs Lisp and easily install it as an extension to the editor .
( GNU Emacs is sometimes called an “ extensible editor ” , but it does much more than provide editing capabilities .
It is better to refer to Emacs as an “ extensible computing environment ” .
However , that phrase is quite a mouthful .
It is easier to refer to Emacs simply as an editor .
Moreover , everything you do in Emacs — find the Mayan date and phases of the moon , simplify polynomials , debug code , manage files , read letters , write books — all these activities are kinds of editing in the most general sense of the word . )
Why Study Emacs Lisp ?
Although Emacs Lisp is usually thought of in association only with Emacs , it is a full computer programming language .
You can use Emacs Lisp as you would any other programming language .
Perhaps you want to understand programming ; perhaps you want to extend Emacs ; or perhaps you want to become a programmer .
This introduction to Emacs Lisp is designed to get you started : to guide you in learning the fundamentals of programming , and more importantly , to show you how you can teach yourself to go further .
On Reading this Text
All through this document , you will see little sample programs you can run inside of Emacs .
If you read this document in Info inside of GNU Emacs , you can run the programs as they appear .
( This is easy to do and is explained when the examples are presented . )
Alternatively , you can read this introduction as a printed book while sitting beside a computer running Emacs .
( This is what I like to do ; I like printed books . )
If you do n’t have a running Emacs beside you , you can still read this book , but in this case , it is best to treat it as a novel or as a travel guide to a country not yet visited : interesting , but not the same as being there .
Much of this introduction is dedicated to walkthroughs or guided tours of code used in GNU Emacs .
These tours are designed for two purposes : first , to give you familiarity with real , working code ( code you use every day ) ; and , second , to give you familiarity with the way Emacs works .
It is interesting to see how a working environment is implemented .
Also , I hope that you will pick up the habit of browsing through source code .
You can learn from it and mine it for ideas .
Having GNU
Emacs is like having a dragon ’s cave of treasures .
In addition to learning about Emacs as an editor and Emacs Lisp as a programming language , the examples and guided tours will give you an opportunity to get acquainted with Emacs as a Lisp programming environment .
GNU Emacs supports programming and provides tools that you will want to become comfortable using , such as M-. ( the key which invokes the xref - find - definitions command ) .
You will also learn about buffers and other objects that are part of the environment .
Learning about these features of Emacs is like learning new routes around your home town .
Finally , I hope to convey some of the skills for using Emacs to learn aspects of programming that you do n’t know .
You can often use Emacs to help you understand what puzzles you or to find out how to do something new .
This self - reliance is not only a pleasure , but an advantage .
For Whom
This is Written
This text is written as an elementary introduction for people who are not programmers .
If you are a programmer , you may not be satisfied with this primer .
The reason is that you may have become expert at reading reference manuals and be put off by the way this text is organized .
An expert programmer who reviewed this text said to me :
I prefer to learn from reference manuals .
I “ dive into ” each paragraph , and “ come up for air ” between paragraphs .
When I get to the end of a paragraph , I assume that subject is done , finished , that I know everything I need ( with the possible exception of the case when the next paragraph starts talking about it in more detail ) .
I expect that a well written reference manual will not have a lot of redundancy , and that it will have excellent pointers to the ( one ) place where the information I want is .
This introduction is not written for this person !
Firstly , I try to say everything at least three times : first , to introduce it ; second , to show it in context ; and third , to show it in a different context , or to review it .
Secondly , I hardly ever put all the information about a subject in one place , much less in one paragraph .
To my way of thinking , that imposes too heavy a burden on the reader .
Instead I try to explain only what you need to know at the time .
( Sometimes I include a little extra information so you wo n’t be surprised later when the additional information is formally introduced . )
When you read this text , you are not expected to learn everything the first time .
Frequently , you need make only a nodding acquaintance with some of the items mentioned .
My hope is that I have structured the text and given you enough hints that you will be alert to what is important , and concentrate on it .
You will need to dive into some paragraphs ; there is no other way to read them .
But I have tried to keep down the number of such paragraphs .
This book is intended as an approachable hill , rather than as a daunting mountain .
This book , An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp , has a companion document , The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual in The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual .
The reference manual has more detail than this introduction .
In the reference manual , all the information about one topic is concentrated in one place .
You should turn to it if you are like the programmer quoted above .
And , of course , after you have read this Introduction , you will find the Reference Manual useful when you are writing your own programs .
Lisp History
Lisp was first developed in the late 1950s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for research in artificial intelligence .
The great power of the Lisp language makes it superior for other purposes as well , such as writing editor commands and integrated environments .
GNU Emacs Lisp is largely inspired by Maclisp , which was written at MIT in the 1960s .
It is somewhat inspired by Common Lisp , which became a standard in the 1980s .
However , Emacs Lisp is much simpler than Common Lisp .
( The standard Emacs distribution contains an optional extensions file , cl.el , that adds many Common Lisp features to Emacs Lisp . )
A Note for Novices
If you do n’t know GNU Emacs , you can still read this document profitably .
However , I recommend you learn Emacs , if only to learn to move around your computer screen .
You can teach yourself how to use Emacs with the built - in tutorial .
To use it , type C-h t .
( This means you press and release the CTRL key and the h at the same time , and then press and release t . )
Also , I often refer to one of Emacs ’s standard commands by listing the keys which you press to invoke the command and then giving the name of the command in parentheses , like this : M - C-\ ( indent - region ) .
What this means is that the indent - region command is customarily invoked by typing M - C - \ .
( You can , if you wish , change the keys that are typed to invoke the command ; this is called rebinding .
See Keymaps . )
The abbreviation M - C - \ means that you type your META key , CTRL key and \ key all at the same time .
( On many modern keyboards the META key is labeled ALT .)
Sometimes a combination like this is called a keychord , since it is similar to the way you play a chord on a piano .
If your keyboard does not have a META key , the ESC key prefix is used in place of it .
In this case , M - C - \ means that you press and release your ESC key and then type the CTRL key and the \ key at the same time .
But usually M - C -\ means press the CTRL key along with the key that is labeled ALT and , at the same time , press the \ key .
In addition to typing a lone keychord , you can prefix what you type with C-u , which is called the universal argument .
The C-u keychord passes an argument to the subsequent command .
Thus , to indent a region of plain text by 6 spaces , mark the region , and then type C-u 6 M - C - \ .
( If you do not specify a number , Emacs either passes the number 4 to the command or otherwise runs the command differently than it would otherwise . )
See Numeric Arguments in The GNU Emacs Manual .
If you are reading this in Info using GNU Emacs , you can read through this whole document just by pressing the space bar , SPC .
( To learn about Info , type C-h i and then select Info . )
A note on terminology : when I use the word Lisp alone , I often am referring to the various dialects of Lisp in general , but when I speak of Emacs Lisp , I am referring to GNU Emacs Lisp in particular .

1 List Processing
To the untutored eye , Lisp is a strange programming language .
In Lisp code there are parentheses everywhere .
Some people even claim that the name stands for “ Lots of Isolated Silly Parentheses ” .
But the claim is unwarranted .
Lisp stands for LISt Processing , and the programming language handles lists ( and lists of lists ) by putting them between parentheses .
The parentheses mark the boundaries of the list .
Sometimes a list is preceded by an apostrophe ‘ ' ’ , called a single - quote in Lisp . 1 Lists are the basis of Lisp .
1.1 Lisp Lists
In Lisp , a list looks like this : ' ( rose violet daisy buttercup ) .
This list is preceded by a single apostrophe .
It could just as well be written as follows , which looks more like the kind of list you are likely to be familiar with :
' ( rose violet daisy buttercup )
The elements of this list are the names of the four different flowers , separated from each other by whitespace and surrounded by parentheses , like flowers in a field with a stone wall around them .
Numbers , Lists inside of Lists
Lists can also have numbers in them , as in this list : (+ 2 2 ) .
This list has a plus - sign , ‘ + ’ , followed by two ‘ 2 ’s , each separated by whitespace .
In Lisp , both data and programs are represented the same way ; that is , they are both lists of words , numbers , or other lists , separated by whitespace and surrounded by parentheses .
( Since a program looks like data , one program may easily serve as data for another ; this is a very powerful feature of Lisp . )
( Incidentally , these two parenthetical remarks are not Lisp lists , because they contain ‘ ; ’ and ‘ . ’ as punctuation marks . )
Here is another list , this time with a list inside of it :
'( this list has ( a list inside of it ) )
The components of this list are the words ‘ this ’ , ‘ list ’ , ‘ has ’ , and the list ‘ ( a list inside of it ) ’.
The interior list is made up of the words ‘ a ’ , ‘ list ’ , ‘ inside ’ , ‘ of ’ , ‘ it ’.
1.1.1 Lisp Atoms
In Lisp , what we have been calling words are called atoms .
This term comes from the historical meaning of the word atom , which means “ indivisible ” .
As far as Lisp is concerned , the words we have been using in the lists cannot be divided into any smaller parts and still mean the same thing as part of a program ; likewise with numbers and single character symbols like ‘ + ’.
On the other hand , unlike an ancient atom , a list can be split into parts .
( See car cdr & cons Fundamental Functions . )
In a list , atoms are separated from each other by whitespace .
They can be right next to a parenthesis .
Technically speaking , a list in Lisp consists of parentheses surrounding atoms separated by whitespace or surrounding other lists or surrounding both atoms and other lists .
A list can have just one atom in it or have nothing in it at all .
A list with nothing in it looks like this : ( ) , and is called the empty list .
Unlike anything else , an empty list is considered both an atom and a list at the same time .
The printed representation of both atoms and lists are called symbolic expressions or , more concisely , s-expressions .
The word expression by itself can refer to either the printed representation , or to the atom or list as it is held internally in the computer .
Often , people use the term expression indiscriminately .
( Also , in many texts , the word form is used as a synonym for expression . )
Incidentally , the atoms that make up our universe were named such when they were thought to be indivisible ; but it has been found that physical atoms are not indivisible .
Parts can split off an atom or it can fission into two parts of roughly equal size .
Physical atoms were named prematurely , before their truer nature was found .
In Lisp , certain kinds of atom , such as an array , can be separated into parts ; but the mechanism for doing this is different from the mechanism for splitting a list .
As far as list operations are concerned , the atoms of a list are unsplittable .
As in English , the meanings of the component letters of a Lisp atom are different from the meaning the letters make as a word .
For example , the word for the South American sloth , the ‘ ai ’ , is completely different from the two words , ‘ a ’ , and ‘ i ’ .
There are many kinds of atom in nature but only a few in Lisp : for example , numbers , such as 37 , 511 , or 1729 , and symbols , such as ‘ + ’ , ‘ foo ’ , or ‘ forward - line ’.
The words we have listed in the examples above are all symbols .
In everyday Lisp conversation , the word “ atom ” is not often used , because programmers usually try to be more specific about what kind of atom they are dealing with .
Lisp programming is mostly about symbols ( and sometimes numbers ) within lists .
( Incidentally , the preceding three word parenthetical remark is a proper list in Lisp , since it consists of atoms , which in this case are symbols , separated by whitespace and enclosed by parentheses , without any non-Lisp punctuation . )
Text between double quotation marks — even sentences or paragraphs — is also an atom .
Here is an example :
'( this list includes " text between quotation marks . " )
In Lisp , all of the quoted text including the punctuation mark and the blank spaces is a single atom .
This kind of atom is called a string ( for “ string of characters ” ) and is the sort of thing that is used for messages that a computer can print for a human to read .
Strings are a different kind of atom than numbers or symbols and are used differently .
1.1.2 Whitespace in Lists
The amount of whitespace in a list does not matter .
From the point of view of the Lisp language ,
'( this list looks like this )
is exactly the same as this :
'( this list looks like this )
Both examples show what to Lisp is the same list , the list made up of the symbols ‘ this ’ , ‘ list ’ , ‘ looks ’ , ‘ like ’ , and ‘ this ’ in that order .
Extra whitespace and newlines are designed to make a list more readable by humans .
When Lisp reads the expression , it gets rid of all the extra whitespace ( but it needs to have at least one space between atoms in order to tell them apart . )
Odd as it seems , the examples we have seen cover almost all of what Lisp lists look like !
Every other list in Lisp looks more or less like one of these examples , except that the list may be longer and more complex .
In brief , a list is between parentheses , a string is between quotation marks , a symbol looks like a word , and a number looks like a number .
( For certain situations , square brackets , dots and a few other special characters may be used ; however , we will go quite far without them . )
1.1.3 GNU Emacs Helps You Type Lists
When you type a Lisp expression in GNU Emacs using either Lisp Interaction mode or Emacs Lisp mode , you have available to you several commands to format the Lisp expression so it is easy to read .
For example , pressing the TAB key automatically indents the line the cursor is on by the right amount .
A command to properly indent the code in a region is customarily bound to M - C - \ .
Indentation is designed so that you can see which elements of a list belong to which list — elements of a sub- list are indented more than the elements of the enclosing list .
In addition , when you type a closing parenthesis , Emacs momentarily jumps the cursor back to the matching opening parenthesis , so you can see which one it is .
This is very useful , since every list you type in Lisp must have its closing parenthesis match its opening parenthesis .
( See Major Modes in The GNU Emacs Manual , for more information about Emacs ’s modes . )
1.2 Run a Program
A list in Lisp — any list — is a program ready to run .
If you run it ( for which the Lisp jargon is evaluate ) , the computer will do one of three things : do nothing except return to you the list itself ; send you an error message ; or , treat the first symbol in the list as a command to do something .
( Usually , of course , it is the last of these three things that you really want ! )
The single apostrophe , ' , that I put in front of some of the example lists in preceding sections is called a quote ; when it precedes a list , it tells Lisp to do nothing with the list , other than take it as it is written .
But if there is no quote preceding a list , the first item of the list is special : it is a command for the computer to obey .
( In Lisp , these commands are called functions . )
The list (+ 2 2 ) shown above did not have a quote in front of it , so Lisp understands that the + is an instruction to do something with the rest of the list : add the numbers that follow .
If you are reading this inside of GNU Emacs in Info , here is how you can evaluate such a list : place your cursor immediately after the right hand parenthesis of the following list and then type C-x C-e :
(+ 2 2 )
You will see the number 4 appear in the echo are a2 .
( What you have just done is evaluate the list .
The echo area is the line at the bottom of the screen that displays or echoes text . )
Now try the same thing with a quoted list : place the cursor right after the following list and type C-x C-e :
'( this is a quoted list )
You will see ( this is a quoted list ) appear in the echo area .
In both cases , what you are doing is giving a command to the program inside of GNU Emacs called the Lisp interpreter — giving the interpreter a command to evaluate the expression .
The name of the Lisp interpreter comes from the word for the task done by a human who comes up with the meaning of an expression — who interprets it .
You can also evaluate an atom that is not part of a list — one that is not surrounded by parentheses ; again , the Lisp interpreter translates from the humanly readable expression to the language of the computer .
But before discussing this ( see Variables ) , we will discuss what the Lisp interpreter does when you make an error .
1.3 Generate an Error Message
Partly so you wo n’t worry if you do it accidentally , we will now give a command to the Lisp interpreter that generates an error message .
This is a harmless activity ; and indeed , we will often try to generate error messages intentionally .
Once you understand the jargon , error messages can be informative .
Instead of being called “ error ” messages , they should be called “ help ” messages .
They are like signposts to a traveler in a strange country ; deciphering them can be hard , but once understood , they can point the way .
The error message is generated by a built - in GNU Emacs debugger .
We will enter the debugger .
You get out of the debugger by typing q .
What we will do is evaluate a list that is not quoted and does not have a meaningful command as its first element .
Here is a list almost exactly the same as the one we just used , but without the single - quote in front of it .
Position the cursor right after it and type C-x C-e :
( this is an unquoted list )
A * Backtrace * window will open up and you should see the following in it :
----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
Debugger entered -- Lisp error : ( void- function this ) ( this is an unquoted list ) eval ( ( this is an unquoted list ) nil ) elisp - - eval - last - sexp ( nil ) eval - last - sexp ( nil ) funcall - interactively ( eval - last - sexp nil ) call - interactively ( eval - last - sexp nil nil ) command - execute ( eval - last - sexp ) ----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
Your cursor will be in this window ( you may have to wait a few seconds before it becomes visible ) .
To quit the debugger and make the debugger window go away , type :
q
Please type q right now , so you become confident that you can get out of the debugger .
Then , type C-x C-e again to re-enter it .
Based on what we already know , we can almost read this error message .
You read the * Backtrace * buffer from the bottom up ; it tells you what Emacs did .
When you typed C-x C-e , you made an interactive call to the command eval - last - sexp .
eval is an abbreviation for “ evaluate ” and sexp is an abbreviation for “ symbolic expression ” .
The command means “ evaluate last symbolic expression ” , which is the expression just before your cursor .
Each line above tells you what the Lisp interpreter evaluated next .
The most recent action is at the top .
The buffer is called the * Backtrace * buffer because it enables you to track Emacs backwards .
At the top of the * Backtrace * buffer , you see the line :
Debugger entered -- Lisp error : ( void- function this )
The Lisp interpreter tried to evaluate the first atom of the list , the word ‘ this ’.
It is this action that generated the error message ‘ void - function this ’.
The message contains the words ‘ void - function ’ and ‘ this ’.
The word ‘ function ’ was mentioned once before .
It is a very important word .
For our purposes , we can define it by saying that a function is a set of instructions to the computer that tell the computer to do something .
Now we can begin to understand the error message : ‘ void - function this ’ .
The function ( that is , the word ‘ this ’) does not have a definition of any set of instructions for the computer to carry out .
The slightly odd word , ‘ void- function ’ , is designed to cover the way Emacs Lisp is implemented , which is that when a symbol does not have a function definition attached to it , the place that should contain the instructions is void .
On the other hand , since we were able to add 2 plus 2 successfully , by evaluating (+ 2 2 ) , we can infer that the symbol + must have a set of instructions for the computer to obey and those instructions must be to add the numbers that follow the + .
It is possible to prevent Emacs entering the debugger in cases like this .
We do not explain how to do that here , but we will mention what the result looks like , because you may encounter a similar situation if there is a bug in some Emacs code that you are using .
In such cases , you will see only one line of error message ; it will appear in the echo area and look like this :
Symbol 's function definition is void : this
The message goes away as soon as you type a key , even just to move the cursor .
We know the meaning of the word ‘ Symbol ’.
It refers to the first atom of the list , the word ‘ this ’.
The word ‘ function ’ refers to the instructions that tell the computer what to do .
( Technically , the symbol tells the computer where to find the instructions , but this is a complication we can ignore for the moment . )
The error message can be understood : ‘ Symbol 's function definition is void : this ’ .
The symbol ( that is , the word ‘ this ’) lacks instructions for the computer to carry out .
1.4 Symbol Names and Function Definitions
We can articulate another characteristic of Lisp based on what we have discussed so far — an important characteristic : a symbol , like + , is not itself the set of instructions for the computer to carry out .
Instead , the symbol is used , perhaps temporarily , as a way of locating the definition or set of instructions .
What we see is the name through which the instructions can be found .
Names of people work the same way .
I can be referred to as ‘ Bob ’; however , I am not the letters ‘ B ’ , ‘ o ’ , ‘ b ’ but am , or was , the consciousness consistently associated with a particular life - form .
The name is not me , but it can be used to refer to me .
In Lisp , one set of instructions can be attached to several names .
For example , the computer instructions for adding numbers can be linked to the symbol plus as well as to the symbol + ( and are in some dialects of Lisp ) .
Among humans , I can be referred to as ‘ Robert ’ as well as ‘ Bob ’ and by other words as well .
On the other hand , a symbol can have only one function definition attached to it at a time .
Otherwise , the computer would be confused as to which definition to use .
If this were the case among people , only one person in the world could be named ‘ Bob ’.
However , the function definition to which the name refers can be changed readily .
( See Install a Function Definition . )
Since Emacs
Lisp is large , it is customary to name symbols in a way that identifies the part of Emacs to which the function belongs .
Thus , all the names for functions that deal with Texinfo start with ‘ texinfo- ’ and those for functions that deal with reading mail start with ‘ rmail - ’.
1.5 The Lisp Interpreter
Based on what we have seen , we can now start to figure out what the Lisp interpreter does when we command it to evaluate a list .
First , it looks to see whether there is a quote before the list ; if there is , the interpreter just gives us the list .
On the other hand , if there is no quote , the interpreter looks at the first element in the list and sees whether it has a function definition .
If it does , the interpreter carries out the instructions in the function definition .
Otherwise , the interpreter prints an error message .
This is how Lisp works .
Simple .
There are added complications which we will get to in a minute , but these are the fundamentals .
Of course , to write Lisp programs , you need to know how to write function definitions and attach them to names , and how to do this without confusing either yourself or the computer .
• Complications : Variables , Special forms , Lists within .
• Byte Compiling : Specially processing code for speed .
Complications
Now , for the first complication .
In addition to lists , the Lisp interpreter can evaluate a symbol that is not quoted and does not have parentheses around it .
The Lisp interpreter will attempt to determine the symbol ’s value as a variable .
This situation is described in the section on variables .
( See Variables . )
The second complication occurs because some functions are unusual and do not work in the usual manner .
Those that do n’t are called special forms .
They are used for special jobs , like defining a function , and there are not many of them .
In the next few chapters , you will be introduced to several of the more important special forms .
As well as special forms , there are also macros .
A macro is a construct defined in Lisp , which differs from a function in that it translates a Lisp expression into another expression that is to be evaluated in place of the original expression .
( See Lisp macro . )
For the purposes of this introduction , you do not need to worry too much about whether something is a special form , macro , or ordinary function .
For example , if is a special form ( see if ) , but when is a macro ( see Lisp macro ) .
In earlier versions of Emacs , defun was a special form , but now it is a macro ( see defun ) .
It still behaves in the same way .
The final complication is this : if the function that the Lisp interpreter is looking at is not a special form , and if it is part of a list , the Lisp interpreter looks to see whether the list has a list inside of it .
If there is an inner list , the Lisp interpreter first figures out what it should do with the inside list , and then it works on the outside list .
If there is yet another list embedded inside the inner list , it works on that one first , and so on .
It always works on the innermost list first .
The interpreter works on the innermost list first , to evaluate the result of that list .
The result may be used by the enclosing expression .
Otherwise , the interpreter works left to right , from one expression to the next .
1.5.1 Byte Compiling
One other aspect of interpreting : the Lisp interpreter is able to interpret two kinds of entity : humanly readable code , on which we will focus exclusively , and specially processed code , called byte compiled code , which is not humanly readable .
Byte compiled code runs faster than humanly readable code .
You can transform humanly readable code into byte compiled code by running one of the compile commands such as byte - compile - file .
Byte compiled code is usually stored in a file that ends with a .elc extension rather than a .el extension .
You will see both kinds of file in the emacs / lisp directory ; the files to read are those with .el extensions .
As a practical matter , for most things you might do to customize or extend Emacs , you do not need to byte compile ; and I will not discuss the topic here .
See Byte Compilation in The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual , for a full description of byte compilation .
1.6 Evaluation
When the Lisp interpreter works on an expression , the term for the activity is called evaluation .
We say that the interpreter “ evaluates the expression ” .
I ’ve used this term several times before .
The word comes from its use in everyday language , “ to ascertain the value or amount of ; to appraise ” , according to Webster ’s New Collegiate Dictionary .
How the Lisp Interpreter Acts
After evaluating an expression , the Lisp interpreter will most likely return the value that the computer produces by carrying out the instructions it found in the function definition , or perhaps it will give up on that function and produce an error message .
( The interpreter may also find itself tossed , so to speak , to a different function or it may attempt to repeat continually what it is doing for ever and ever in an infinite loop .
These actions are less common ; and we can ignore them . )
Most frequently , the interpreter returns a value .
At the same time the interpreter returns a value , it may do something else as well , such as move a cursor or copy a file ; this other kind of action is called a side effect .
Actions that we humans think are important , such as printing results , are often side effects to the Lisp interpreter .
It is fairly easy to learn to use side effects .
In summary , evaluating a symbolic expression most commonly causes the Lisp interpreter to return a value and perhaps carry out a side effect ; or else produce an error .
1.6.1 Evaluating Inner Lists
If evaluation applies to a list that is inside another list , the outer list may use the value returned by the first evaluation as information when the outer list is evaluated .
This explains why inner expressions are evaluated first : the values they return are used by the outer expressions .
We can investigate this process by evaluating another addition example .
Place your cursor after the following expression and type C-x C-e :
(+ 2 (+ 3 3 ) )
The number 8 will appear in the echo area .
What happens is that the Lisp interpreter first evaluates the inner expression , (+ 3 3 ) , for which the value 6 is returned ; then it evaluates the outer expression as if it were written (+ 2 6 ) , which returns the value 8 .
Since there are no more enclosing expressions to evaluate , the interpreter prints that value in the echo area .
Now it is easy to understand the name of the command invoked by the keystrokes C-x C-e : the name is eval - last - sexp .
The letters sexp are an abbreviation for “ symbolic expression ” , and eval is an abbreviation for “ evaluate ” .
The command evaluates the last symbolic expression .
As an experiment , you can try evaluating the expression by putting the cursor at the beginning of the next line immediately following the expression , or inside the expression .
Here is another copy of the expression :
(+ 2 (+ 3 3 ) )
If you place the cursor at the beginning of the blank line that immediately follows the expression and type C-x C-e , you will still get the value 8 printed in the echo area .
Now try putting the cursor inside the expression .
If you put it right after the next to last parenthesis ( so it appears to sit on top of the last parenthesis ) , you will get a 6 printed in the echo area !
This is because the command evaluates the expression (+ 3 3 ) .
Now put the cursor immediately after a number .
Type C-x C-e and you will get the number itself .
In Lisp , if you evaluate a number , you get the number itself — this is how numbers differ from symbols .
If you evaluate a list starting with a symbol like + , you will get a value returned that is the result of the computer carrying out the instructions in the function definition attached to that name .
If a symbol by itself is evaluated , something different happens , as we will see in the next section .
1.7 Variables
In Emacs Lisp , a symbol can have a value attached to it just as it can have a function definition attached to it .
The two are different .
The function definition is a set of instructions that a computer will obey .
A value , on the other hand , is something , such as number or a name , that can vary ( which is why such a symbol is called a variable ) .
The value of a symbol can be any expression in Lisp , such as a symbol , number , list , or string .
A symbol that has a value is often called a variable .
A symbol can have both a function definition and a value attached to it at the same time .
Or it can have just one or the other .
The two are separate .
This is somewhat similar to the way the name Cambridge can refer to the city in Massachusetts and have some information attached to the name as well , such as “ great programming center ” .
Another way to think about this is to imagine a symbol as being a chest of drawers .
The function definition is put in one drawer , the value in another , and so on .
What is put in the drawer holding the value can be changed without affecting the contents of the drawer holding the function definition , and vice versa .
• fill - column Example : • Void Function :
The error message for a symbol without a function .
• Void Variable :
The error message for a symbol without a value .
fill - column , an Example Variable
The variable fill - column illustrates a symbol with a value attached to it : in every GNU Emacs buffer , this symbol is set to some value , usually 72 or 70 , but sometimes to some other value .
To find the value of this symbol , evaluate it by itself .
If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs , you can do this by putting the cursor after the symbol and typing C-x C-e :
fill - column
After I typed C-x C-e , Emacs printed the number 72 in my echo area .
This is the value for which fill - column is set for me as I write this .
It may be different for you in your Info buffer .
Notice that the value returned as a variable is printed in exactly the same way as the value returned by a function carrying out its instructions .
From the point of view of the Lisp interpreter , a value returned is a value returned .
What kind of expression it came from ceases to matter once the value is known .
A symbol can have any value attached to it or , to use the jargon , we can bind the variable to a value : to a number , such as 72 ; to a string , " such as this " ; to a list , such as ( spruce pine oak ) ; we can even bind a variable to a function definition .
A symbol can be bound to a value in several ways .
See Setting the Value of a Variable , for information about one way to do this .
1.7.1 Error Message for a Symbol Without a Function
When we evaluated fill - column to find its value as a variable , we did not place parentheses around the word .
This is because we did not intend to use it as a function name .
If fill - column were the first or only element of a list , the Lisp interpreter would attempt to find the function definition attached to it .
But fill - column has no function definition .
Try evaluating this :
( fill - column )
You will create a * Backtrace * buffer that says :
----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
Debugger entered -- Lisp error : ( void- function fill - column ) ( fill - column ) eval ( ( fill - column ) nil ) elisp - - eval - last - sexp ( nil ) eval - last - sexp ( nil ) funcall - interactively ( eval - last - sexp nil ) call - interactively ( eval - last - sexp nil nil ) command - execute ( eval - last - sexp ) ----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
( Remember , to quit the debugger and make the debugger window go away , type q in the * Backtrace * buffer . )
1.7.2 Error Message for a Symbol Without a Value
If you attempt to evaluate a symbol that does not have a value bound to it , you will receive an error message .
You can see this by experimenting with our 2 plus 2 addition .
In the following expression , put your cursor right after the + , before the first number 2 , type C-x C-e :
(+ 2 2 )
In GNU Emacs 22 , you will create a * Backtrace * buffer that says :
----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
Debugger entered -- Lisp error : ( void - variable +) eval (+ ) elisp - - eval - last - sexp ( nil ) eval - last - sexp ( nil ) funcall - interactively ( eval - last - sexp nil ) call - interactively ( eval - last - sexp nil nil ) command - execute ( eval - last - sexp ) ----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
( Again , you can quit the debugger by typing q in the * Backtrace * buffer . )
This backtrace is different from the very first error message we saw , which said , ‘ Debugger entered -- Lisp error : ( void- function this ) ’.
In this case , the function does not have a value as a variable ; while in the other error message , the function ( the word ‘ this ’) did not have a definition .
In this experiment with the + , what we did was cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate the + and look for the value of the variable instead of the function definition .
We did this by placing the cursor right after the symbol rather than after the parenthesis of the enclosing list as we did before .
As a consequence , the Lisp interpreter evaluated the preceding s-expression , which in this case was + by itself .
Since + does not have a value bound to it , just the function definition , the error message reported that the symbol ’s value as a variable was void .
1.8 Arguments
To see how information is passed to functions , let ’s look again at our old standby , the addition of two plus two .
In Lisp , this is written as follows :
(+ 2 2 )
If you evaluate this expression , the number 4 will appear in your echo area .
What the Lisp interpreter does is add the numbers that follow the + .
The numbers added by + are called the arguments of the function + .
These numbers are the information that is given to or passed to the function .
The word “ argument ” comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not refer to a disputation between two people ; instead it refers to the information presented to the function , in this case , to the + .
In Lisp , the arguments to a function are the atoms or lists that follow the function .
The values returned by the evaluation of these atoms or lists are passed to the function .
Different functions require different numbers of arguments ; some functions require none at all .
3
1.8.1 Arguments ’ Data Types
The type of data that should be passed to a function depends on what kind of information it uses .
The arguments to a function such as + must have values that are numbers , since + adds numbers .
Other functions use different kinds of data for their arguments .
For example , the concat function links together or unites two or more strings of text to produce a string .
The arguments are strings .
Concatenating the two character strings abc , def produces the single string abcdef .
This can be seen by evaluating the following :
( concat " abc " " def " )
The value produced by evaluating this expression is " abcdef " .
A function such as substring uses both a string and numbers as arguments .
The function returns a part of the string , a substring of the first argument .
This function takes three arguments .
Its first argument is the string of characters , the second and third arguments are numbers that indicate the beginning ( inclusive ) and end ( exclusive ) of the substring .
The numbers are a count of the number of characters ( including spaces and punctuation ) from the beginning of the string .
Note that the characters in a string are numbered from zero , not one .
For example , if you evaluate the following :
( substring " The quick brown fox jumped . " 16 19 )
you will see " fox " appear in the echo area .
The arguments are the string and the two numbers .
Note that the string passed to substring is a single atom even though it is made up of several words separated by spaces .
Lisp counts everything between the two quotation marks as part of the string , including the spaces .
You can think of the substring function as a kind of atom smasher since it takes an otherwise indivisible atom and extracts a part .
However , substring is only able to extract a substring from an argument that is a string , not from another type of atom such as a number or symbol .
1.8.2 An Argument as the Value of a Variable or List
An argument can be a symbol that returns a value when it is evaluated .
For example , when the symbol fill - column by itself is evaluated , it returns a number .
This number can be used in an addition .
Position the cursor after the following expression and type C-x C-e :
(+ 2 fill - column )
The value will be a number two more than what you get by evaluating fill - column alone .
For me , this is 74 , because my value of fill - column is 72 .
As we have just seen , an argument can be a symbol that returns a value when evaluated .
In addition , an argument can be a list that returns a value when it is evaluated .
For example , in the following expression , the arguments to the function concat are the strings " The " and " red foxes . " and the list ( number - to - string (+ 2 fill - column ) ) .
( concat " The " ( number - to - string (+ 2 fill - column ) ) " red foxes . " )
If you evaluate this expression — and if , as with my Emacs , fill - column evaluates to 72 — " The 74 red foxes . " will appear in the echo area .
( Note that you must put spaces after the word ‘ The ’ and before the word ‘ red ’ so they will appear in the final string .
The function number - to - string converts the integer that the addition function returns to a string .
number - to - string is also known as int - to - string . )
1.8.3 Variable Number of Arguments
Some functions , such as concat , + or * , take any number of arguments .
( The * is the symbol for multiplication . )
This can be seen by evaluating each of the following expressions in the usual way .
What you will see in the echo area is printed in this text after ‘ ⇒ ’ , which you may read as “ evaluates to ” .
In the first set , the functions have no arguments :
(+) ⇒ 0 (* ) ⇒ 1
In this set , the functions have one argument each :
(+ 3 ) ⇒ 3 (* 3 ) ⇒ 3
In this set , the functions have three arguments each :
(+ 3 4 5 ) ⇒ 12 (* 3 4 5 ) ⇒ 60
1.8.4 Using the Wrong Type Object as an Argument
When a function is passed an argument of the wrong type , the Lisp interpreter produces an error message .
For example , the + function expects the values of its arguments to be numbers .
As an experiment we can pass it the quoted symbol hello instead of a number .
Position the cursor after the following expression and type C-x C-e :
(+ 2 ' hello )
When you do this you will generate an error message .
What has happened is that + has tried to add the 2 to the value returned by ' hello , but the value returned by ' hello is the symbol hello , not a number .
Only numbers can be added .
So + could not carry out its addition .
You will create and enter a * Backtrace * buffer that says :
----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
Debugger entered -- Lisp error : ( wrong - type - argument number - or - marker - p hello ) +( 2 hello ) eval ( (+ 2 ' hello ) nil ) elisp - - eval - last - sexp ( t ) eval - last - sexp ( nil ) funcall - interactively ( eval - print - last - sexp nil ) call - interactively ( eval - print - last - sexp nil nil ) command - execute ( eval - print - last - sexp ) ----------
Buffer : * Backtrace *
----------
As usual , the error message tries to be helpful and makes sense after you learn how to read it .
4
The first part of the error message is straightforward ; it says ‘ wrong type argument ’.
Next comes the mysterious jargon word ‘ number - or - marker - p ’ .
This word is trying to tell you what kind of argument the + expected .
The symbol number - or - marker - p says that the Lisp interpreter is trying to determine whether the information presented it ( the value of the argument ) is a number or a marker ( a special object representing a buffer position ) .
What it does is test to see whether the + is being given numbers to add .
It also tests to see whether the argument is something called a marker , which is a specific feature of Emacs Lisp .
( In Emacs , locations in a buffer are recorded as markers .
When the mark is set with the C-@ or C - SPC command , its position is kept as a marker .
The mark can be considered a number — the number of characters the location is from the beginning of the buffer . )
In Emacs Lisp , + can be used to add the numeric value of marker positions as numbers .
The ‘ p ’ of number - or - marker - p is the embodiment of a practice started in the early days of Lisp programming .
The ‘ p ’ stands for “ predicate ” .
In the jargon used by the early Lisp researchers , a predicate refers to a function to determine whether some property is true or false .
So the ‘ p ’ tells us that number - or - marker - p is the name of a function that determines whether it is true or false that the argument supplied is a number or a marker .
Other Lisp symbols that end in ‘ p ’ include zerop , a function that tests whether its argument has the value of zero , and listp , a function that tests whether its argument is a list .
Finally , the last part of the error message is the symbol hello .
This is the value of the argument that was passed to + .
If the addition had been passed the correct type of object , the value passed would have been a number , such as 37 , rather than a symbol like hello .
But then you would not have got the error message .
1.8.5 The message Function
Like + , the message function takes a variable number of arguments .
It is used to send messages to the user and is so useful that we will describe it here .
A message is printed in the echo area .
For example , you can print a message in your echo area by evaluating the following list :
( message " This message appears in the echo area ! " )
The whole string between double quotation marks is a single argument and is printed in toto .
( Note that in this example , the message itself will appear in the echo area within double quotes ; that is because you see the value returned by the message function .
In most uses of message in programs that you write , the text will be printed in the echo area as a side - effect , without the quotes .
See multiply - by - seven in detail , for an example of this . )
However , if there is a ‘ %s ’ in the quoted string of characters , the message function does not print the ‘ %s ’ as such , but looks to the argument that follows the string .
It evaluates the second argument and prints the value at the location in the string where the ‘ %s ’ is .
You can see this by positioning the cursor after the following expression and typing C-x C-e :
( message " The name of this buffer is : %s. " ( buffer - name ) )
In Info , " The name of this buffer is : * info * . " will appear in the echo area .
The function buffer - name returns the name of the buffer as a string , which the message function inserts in place of %s .
To print a value as an integer , use ‘ %d ’ in the same way as ‘ %s ’.
For example , to print a message in the echo area that states the value of the fill - column , evaluate the following :
( message " The value of fill - column is % d. " fill - column )
On my system , when I evaluate this list , " The value of fill - column is 72 . " appears in my echo area5 .
If there is more than one ‘ %s ’ in the quoted string , the value of the first argument following the quoted string is printed at the location of the first ‘ %s ’ and the value of the second argument is printed at the location of the second ‘ %s ’ , and so on .
For example , if you evaluate the following ,
( message " There are %d %s in the office ! " ( - fill - column 14 ) " pink elephants " )
a rather whimsical message will appear in your echo area .
On my system it says , " There are 58 pink elephants in the office ! " .
The expression ( - fill - column 14 ) is evaluated and the resulting number is inserted in place of the ‘ %d ’; and the string in double quotes , " pink elephants " , is treated as a single argument and inserted in place of the ‘ %s ’.
( That is to say , a string between double quotes evaluates to itself , like a number . )
Finally , here is a somewhat complex example that not only illustrates the computation of a number , but also shows how you can use an expression within an expression to generate the text that is substituted for ‘ %s ’:
( message " He saw %d %s " ( - fill - column 32 ) ( concat " red " ( substring " The quick brown foxes jumped . " 16 21 ) " leaping . " ) )
In this example , message has three arguments : the string , " He saw %d %s " , the expression , ( - fill - column 32 ) , and the expression beginning with the function concat .
The value resulting from the evaluation of ( - fill - column 32 ) is inserted in place of the ‘ %d ’; and the value returned by the expression beginning with concat is inserted in place of the ‘ %s ’.
When your fill column is 70 and you evaluate the expression , the message " He saw 38 red foxes leaping . " appears in your echo area .
1.9 Setting the Value of a Variable
There are several ways by which a variable can be given a value .
One of the ways is to use either the function set or the special form setq .
Another way is to use let ( see let ) .
( The jargon for this process is to bind a variable to a value . )
The following sections not only describe how set and setq work but also illustrate how arguments are passed .
• Using set : Setting values .
• Using setq : Setting a quoted value .
• Counting : Using setq to count .
1.9.1 Using set
To set the value of the symbol flowers to the list ' ( rose violet daisy buttercup ) , evaluate the following expression by positioning the cursor after the expression and typing C-x C-e .
( set ' flowers '( rose violet daisy buttercup ) )
The list ( rose violet daisy buttercup ) will appear in the echo area .
This is what is returned by the set function .
As a side effect , the symbol flowers is bound to the list ; that is , the symbol flowers , which can be viewed as a variable , is given the list as its value .
( This process , by the way , illustrates how a side effect to the Lisp interpreter , setting the value , can be the primary effect that we humans are interested in .
This is because every Lisp function must return a value if it does not get an error , but it will only have a side effect if it is designed to have one . )
After evaluating the set expression , you can evaluate the symbol flowers and it will return the value you just set .
Here is the symbol .
Place your cursor after it and type C-x C-e .
flowers
When you evaluate flowers , the list ( rose violet daisy buttercup ) appears in the echo area .
Incidentally , if you evaluate ' flowers , the variable with a quote in front of it , what you will see in the echo area is the symbol itself , flowers .
Here is the quoted symbol , so you can try this :
' flowers
Note also , that when you use set , you need to quote both arguments to set , unless you want them evaluated .
Since we do not want either argument evaluated , neither the variable flowers nor the list ( rose violet daisy buttercup ) , both are quoted .
( When you use set without quoting its first argument , the first argument is evaluated before anything else is done .
If you did this and flowers did not have a value already , you would get an error message that the ‘ Symbol 's value as variable is void ’; on the other hand , if flowers did return a value after it was evaluated , the set would attempt to set the value that was returned .
There are situations where this is the right thing for the function to do ; but such situations are rare . )
1.9.2 Using setq
As a practical matter , you almost always quote the first argument to set .
The combination of set and a quoted first argument is so common that it has its own name : the special form setq .
This special form is just like set except that the first argument is quoted automatically , so you do n’t need to type the quote mark yourself .
Also , as an added convenience , setq permits you to set several different variables to different values , all in one expression .
To set the value of the variable carnivores to the list ' ( lion tiger leopard ) using setq , the following expression is used :
( setq carnivores ' ( lion tiger leopard ) )
This is exactly the same as using set except the first argument is automatically quoted by setq .
( The ‘ q ’ in setq means quote . )
With set , the expression would look like this :
( set ' carnivores '( lion tiger leopard ) )
Also , setq can be used to assign different values to different variables .
The first argument is bound to the value of the second argument , the third argument is bound to the value of the fourth argument , and so on .
For example , you could use the following to assign a list of trees to the symbol trees and a list of herbivores to the symbol herbivores :
( setq trees '( pine fir oak maple ) herbivores ' ( gazelle antelope zebra ) )
( The expression could just as well have been on one line , but it might not have fit on a page ; and humans find it easier to read nicely formatted lists . )
Although I have been using the term “ assign ” , there is another way of thinking about the workings of set and setq ; and that is to say that set and setq make the symbol point to the list .
This latter way of thinking is very common and in forthcoming chapters we shall come upon at least one symbol that has “ pointer ” as part of its name .
The name is chosen because the symbol has a value , specifically a list , attached to it ; or , expressed another way , the symbol is set to point to the list .
1.9.3 Counting
Here is an example that shows how to use setq in a counter .
You might use this to count how many times a part of your program repeats itself .
First set a variable to zero ; then add one to the number each time the program repeats itself .
To do this , you need a variable that serves as a counter , and two expressions : an initial setq expression that sets the counter variable to zero ; and a second setq expression that increments the counter each time it is evaluated .
( setq counter 0 ) ; Let ’s call this the initializer .
( setq counter (+ counter 1 ) ) ;
This is the incrementer .
counter ;
This is the counter .
( The text following the ‘ ; ’ are comments .
See Change a Function Definition . )
If you evaluate the first of these expressions , the initializer , ( setq counter 0 ) , and then evaluate the third expression , counter , the number 0 will appear in the echo area .
If you then evaluate the second expression , the incrementer , ( setq counter (+ counter 1 ) ) , the counter will get the value 1 .
So if you again evaluate counter , the number 1 will appear in the echo area .
Each time you evaluate the second expression , the value of the counter will be incremented .
When you evaluate the incrementer , ( setq counter (+ counter 1 ) ) , the Lisp interpreter first evaluates the innermost list ; this is the addition .
In order to evaluate this list , it must evaluate the variable counter and the number 1 .
When it evaluates the variable counter , it receives its current value .
It passes this value and the number 1 to the + which adds them together .
The sum is then returned as the value of the inner list and passed to the setq which sets the variable counter to this new value .
Thus , the value of the variable , counter , is changed .
1.10 Summary
Learning Lisp is like climbing a hill in which the first part is the steepest .
You have now climbed the most difficult part ; what remains becomes easier as you progress onwards .
In summary ,
Lisp programs are made up of expressions , which are lists or single atoms .
Lists are made up of zero or more atoms or inner lists , separated by whitespace and surrounded by parentheses .
A list can be empty .
Atoms are multi-character symbols , like forward - paragraph , single character symbols like + , strings of characters between double quotation marks , or numbers .
, single character symbols like , strings of characters between double quotation marks , or numbers .
A number evaluates to itself .
A string between double quotes also evaluates to itself .
When you evaluate a symbol by itself , its value is returned .
When you evaluate a list , the Lisp interpreter looks at the first symbol in the list and then at the function definition bound to that symbol .
Then the instructions in the function definition are carried out .
A single - quote ‘ ' ’ tells the Lisp interpreter that it should return the following expression as written , and not evaluate it as it would if the quote were not there .
’ tells the Lisp interpreter that it should return the following expression as written , and not evaluate it as it would if the quote were not there .
Arguments are the information passed to a function .
The arguments to a function are computed by evaluating the rest of the elements of the list of which the function is the first element .
A function always returns a value when it is evaluated ( unless it gets an error ) ; in addition , it may also carry out some action that is a side effect .
In many cases , a function ’s primary purpose is to create a side effect .
1.11 Exercises
A few simple exercises :
Generate an error message by evaluating an appropriate symbol that is not within parentheses .
Generate an error message by evaluating an appropriate symbol that is between parentheses .
Create a counter that increments by two rather than one .
Write an expression that prints a message in the echo area when evaluated .
2 Practicing Evaluation
Before learning how to write a function definition in Emacs Lisp , it is useful to spend a little time evaluating various expressions that have already been written .
These expressions will be lists with the functions as their first ( and often only ) element .
Since some of the functions associated with buffers are both simple and interesting , we will start with those .
In this section , we will evaluate a few of these .
In another section , we will study the code of several other buffer - related functions , to see how they were written .
How to Evaluate
Whenever you give an editing command to Emacs Lisp , such as the command to move the cursor or to scroll the screen , you are evaluating an expression , the first element of which is a function .
This is how Emacs works .
When you type keys , you cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate an expression and that is how you get your results .
Even typing plain text involves evaluating an Emacs Lisp function , in this case , one that uses self - insert - command , which simply inserts the character you typed .
The functions you evaluate by typing keystrokes are called interactive functions , or commands ; how you make a function interactive will be illustrated in the chapter on how to write function definitions .
See Making a Function Interactive .
In addition to typing keyboard commands , we have seen a second way to evaluate an expression : by positioning the cursor after a list and typing C-x C-e .
This is what we will do in the rest of this section .
There are other ways to evaluate an expression as well ; these will be described as we come to them .
Besides being used for practicing evaluation , the functions shown in the next few sections are important in their own right .
A study of these functions makes clear the distinction between buffers and files , how to switch to a buffer , and how to determine a location within it .
2.1 Buffer Names
The two functions , buffer - name and buffer - file - name , show the difference between a file and a buffer .
When you evaluate the following expression , ( buffer - name ) , the name of the buffer appears in the echo area .
When you evaluate ( buffer - file - name ) , the name of the file to which the buffer refers appears in the echo area .
Usually , the name returned by ( buffer - name ) is the same as the name of the file to which it refers , and the name returned by ( buffer - file - name ) is the full path - name of the file .
A file and a buffer are two different entities .
A file is information recorded permanently in the computer ( unless you delete it ) .
A buffer , on the other hand , is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at the end of the editing session ( or when you kill the buffer ) .
Usually , a buffer contains information that you have copied from a file ; we say the buffer is visiting that file .
This copy is what you work on and modify .
Changes to the buffer do not change the file , until you save the buffer .
When you save the buffer , the buffer is copied to the file and is thus saved permanently .
If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs , you can evaluate each of the following expressions by positioning the cursor after it and typing C-x C-e .
( buffer - name ) ( buffer - file - name )
When I do this in Info , the value returned by evaluating ( buffer - name ) is " * info* " , and the value returned by evaluating ( buffer - file - name ) is nil .
On the other hand , while I am writing this document , the value returned by evaluating ( buffer - name ) is " introduction.texinfo " , and the value returned by evaluating ( buffer- file - name ) is " /gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo " .
The former is the name of the buffer and the latter is the name of the file .
In Info , the buffer name is " * info * " .
Info does not point to any file , so the result of evaluating ( buffer - file - name ) is nil .
The symbol nil is from the Latin word for “ nothing ” ; in this case , it means that the buffer is not associated with any file .
( In Lisp , nil is also used to mean “ false ” and is a synonym for the empty list , ( ) . )
When I am writing , the name of my buffer is " introduction.texinfo " .
The name of the file to which it points is " /gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo " .
( In the expressions , the parentheses tell the Lisp interpreter to treat buffer - name and buffer - file - name as functions ; without the parentheses , the interpreter would attempt to evaluate the symbols as variables .
See Variables . )
In spite of the distinction between files and buffers , you will often find that people refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice versa .
Indeed , most people say , “ I am editing a file , ” rather than saying , “ I am editing a buffer which I will soon save to a file . ”
It is almost always clear from context what people mean .
When dealing with computer programs , however , it is important to keep the distinction in mind , since the computer is not as smart as a person .
The word “ buffer ” , by the way , comes from the meaning of the word as a cushion that deadens the force of a collision .
In early computers , a buffer cushioned the interaction between files and the computer ’s central processing unit .
The drums or tapes that held a file and the central processing unit were pieces of equipment that were very different from each other , working at their own speeds , in spurts .
The buffer made it possible for them to work together effectively .
Eventually , the buffer grew from being an intermediary , a temporary holding place , to being the place where work is done .
This transformation is rather like that of a small seaport that grew into a great city : once it was merely the place where cargo was warehoused temporarily before being loaded onto ships ; then it became a business and cultural center in its own right .
Not all buffers are associated with files .
For example , a * scratch * buffer does not visit any file .
Similarly , a * Help * buffer is not associated with any file .
In the old days , when you lacked a ~/.emacs file and started an Emacs session by typing the command emacs alone , without naming any files , Emacs started with the * scratch * buffer visible .
Nowadays , you will see a splash screen .
You can follow one of the commands suggested on the splash screen , visit a file , or press q to quit the splash screen and reach the * scratch * buffer .
If you switch to the * scratch * buffer , type ( buffer - name ) , position the cursor after it , and then type C-x C-e to evaluate the expression .
The name " * scratch * " will be returned and will appear in the echo area .
" * scratch * " is the name of the buffer .
When you type ( buffer - file - name ) in the * scratch * buffer and evaluate that , nil will appear in the echo area , just as it does when you evaluate ( buffer - file - name ) in Info .
Incidentally , if you are in the * scratch * buffer and want the value returned by an expression to appear in the * scratch * buffer itself rather than in the echo area , type C-u C-x C-e instead of C-x C-e .
This causes the value returned to appear after the expression .
The buffer will look like this :
( buffer - name ) " * scratch * "
You cannot do this in Info since Info is read - only and it will not allow you to change the contents of the buffer .
But you can do this in any buffer you can edit ; and when you write code or documentation ( such as this book ) , this feature is very useful .
2.2 Getting Buffers
The buffer - name function returns the name of the buffer ; to get the buffer itself , a different function is needed : the current - buffer function .
If you use this function in code , what you get is the buffer itself .
A name and the object or entity to which the name refers are different from each other .
You are not your name .
You are a person to whom others refer by name .
If you ask to speak to George and someone hands you a card with the letters ‘ G ’ , ‘ e ’ , ‘ o ’ , ‘ r ’ , ‘ g ’ , and ‘ e ’ written on it , you might be amused , but you would not be satisfied .
You do not want to speak to the name , but to the person to whom the name refers .
A buffer is similar : the name of the scratch buffer is * scratch * , but the name is not the buffer .
To get a buffer itself , you need to use a function such as current - buffer .
However , there is a slight complication : if you evaluate current - buffer in an expression on its own , as we will do here , what you see is a printed representation of the name of the buffer without the contents of the buffer .
Emacs works this way for two reasons : the buffer may be thousands of lines long — too long to be conveniently displayed ; and , another buffer may have the same contents but a different name , and it is important to distinguish between them .
Here is an expression containing the function :
( current - buffer )
If you evaluate this expression in Info in Emacs in the usual way , # < buffer * info * > will appear in the echo area .
The special format indicates that the buffer itself is being returned , rather than just its name .
Incidentally , while you can type a number or symbol into a program , you cannot do that with the printed representation of a buffer : the only way to get a buffer itself is with a function such as current - buffer .
A related function is other - buffer .
This returns the most recently selected buffer other than the one you are in currently , not a printed representation of its name .
If you have recently switched back and forth from the * scratch * buffer , other - buffer will return that buffer .
You can see this by evaluating the expression :
( other - buffer )
You should see #< buffer * scratch * > appear in the echo area , or the name of whatever other buffer you switched back from most recently6 .
2.3 Switching Buffers
The other - buffer function actually provides a buffer when it is used as an argument to a function that requires one .
We can see this by using other - buffer and switch - to - buffer to switch to a different buffer .
But first , a brief introduction to the switch - to - buffer function .
When you switched back and forth from Info to the * scratch * buffer to evaluate ( buffer - name ) , you most likely typed C-x b and then typed * scratch * 7 when prompted in the minibuffer for the name of the buffer to which you wanted to switch .
The keystrokes , C-x b , cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate the interactive function switch - to - buffer .
As we said before , this is how Emacs works : different keystrokes call or run different functions .
For example , C - f calls forward - char , M-e calls forward - sentence , and so on .
By writing switch - to - buffer in an expression , and giving it a buffer to switch to , we can switch buffers just the way C-x b does :
( switch - to - buffer ( other - buffer ) )
The symbol switch - to - buffer is the first element of the list , so the Lisp interpreter will treat it as a function and carry out the instructions that are attached to it .
But before doing that , the interpreter will note that other - buffer is inside parentheses and work on that symbol first .
other - buffer is the first ( and in this case , the only ) element of this list , so the Lisp interpreter calls or runs the function .
It returns another buffer .
Next , the interpreter runs switch - to - buffer , passing to it , as an argument , the other buffer , which is what Emacs will switch to .
If you are reading this in Info , try this now .
Evaluate the expression .
( To get back , type C-x b RET . )
8
In the programming examples in later sections of this document , you will see the function set - buffer more often than switch - to - buffer .
This is because of a difference between computer programs and humans : humans have eyes and expect to see the buffer on which they are working on their computer terminals .
This is so obvious , it almost goes without saying .
However , programs do not have eyes .
When a computer program works on a buffer , that buffer does not need to be visible on the screen .
switch - to - buffer is designed for humans and does two different things : it switches the buffer to which Emacs ’s attention is directed ; and it switches the buffer displayed in the window to the new buffer .
set - buffer , on the other hand , does only one thing : it switches the attention of the computer program to a different buffer .
The buffer on the screen remains unchanged ( of course , normally nothing happens there until the command finishes running ) .
Also , we have just introduced another jargon term , the word call .
When you evaluate a list in which the first symbol is a function , you are calling that function .
The use of the term comes from the notion of the function as an entity that can do something for you if you call it — just as a plumber is an entity who can fix a leak if you call him or her .
2.4 Buffer Size and the Location of Point
Finally , let ’s look at several rather simple functions , buffer - size , point , point - min , and point - max .
These give information about the size of a buffer and the location of point within it .
The function buffer - size tells you the size of the current buffer ; that is , the function returns a count of the number of characters in the buffer .
( buffer - size )
You can evaluate this in the usual way , by positioning the cursor after the expression and typing C-x C-e .
In Emacs , the current position of the cursor is called point .
The expression ( point ) returns a number that tells you where the cursor is located as a count of the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer up to point .
You can see the character count for point in this buffer by evaluating the following expression in the usual way :
( point )
As I write this , the value of point is 65724 .
The point function is frequently used in some of the examples later in this book .
The value of point depends , of course , on its location within the buffer .
If you evaluate point in this spot , the number will be larger :
( point )
For me , the value of point in this location is 66043 , which means that there are 319 characters ( including spaces ) between the two expressions .
( Doubtless , you will see different numbers , since I will have edited this since I first evaluated point . )
The function point - min is somewhat similar to point , but it returns the value of the minimum permissible value of point in the current buffer .
This is the number 1 unless narrowing is in effect .
( Narrowing is a mechanism whereby you can restrict yourself , or a program , to operations on just a part of a buffer .
See Narrowing and Widening . )
Likewise , the function point - max returns the value of the maximum permissible value of point in the current buffer .
2.5 Exercise
Find a file with which you are working and move towards its middle .
Find its buffer name , file name , length , and your position in the file .
3 How To Write Function Definitions
When the Lisp interpreter evaluates a list , it looks to see whether the first symbol on the list has a function definition attached to it ; or , put another way , whether the symbol points to a function definition .
If it does , the computer carries out the instructions in the definition .
A symbol that has a function definition is called , simply , a function ( although , properly speaking , the definition is the function and the symbol refers to it . )
An Aside about Primitive Functions
All functions are defined in terms of other functions , except for a few primitive functions that are written in the C programming language .
When you write functions ’ definitions , you will write them in Emacs Lisp and use other functions as your building blocks .
Some of the functions you will use will themselves be written in Emacs Lisp ( perhaps by you ) and some will be primitives written in C .
The primitive functions are used exactly like those written in Emacs Lisp and behave like them .
They are written in C so we can easily run GNU Emacs on any computer that has sufficient power and can run C .
Let me re-emphasize this : when you write code in Emacs Lisp , you do not distinguish between the use of functions written in C and the use of functions written in Emacs Lisp .
The difference is irrelevant .
I mention the distinction only because it is interesting to know .
Indeed , unless you investigate , you wo n’t know whether an already - written function is written in Emacs Lisp or C .
3.1 The defun Macro
In Lisp , a symbol such as mark - whole - buffer has code attached to it that tells the computer what to do when the function is called .
This code is called the function definition and is created by evaluating a Lisp expression that starts with the symbol defun ( which is an abbreviation for define function ) .
In subsequent sections , we will look at function definitions from the Emacs source code , such as mark - whole - buffer .
In this section , we will describe a simple function definition so you can see how it looks .
This function definition uses arithmetic because it makes for a simple example .
Some people dislike examples using arithmetic ; however , if you are such a person , do not despair .
Hardly any of the code we will study in the remainder of this introduction involves arithmetic or mathematics .
The examples mostly involve text in one way or another .
A function definition has up to five parts following the word defun :
The name of the symbol to which the function definition should be attached .
A list of the arguments that will be passed to the function .
If no arguments will be passed to the function , this is an empty list , ( ) .
Documentation describing the function .
( Technically optional , but strongly recommended . )
Optionally , an expression to make the function interactive so you can use it by typing M-x and then the name of the function ; or by typing an appropriate key or keychord .
The code that instructs the computer what to do : the body of the function definition .
It is helpful to think of the five parts of a function definition as being organized in a template , with slots for each part :
( defun function - name ( arguments … ) " optional - documentation … " ( interactive argument - passing - info ) ; optional body …)
As an example , here is the code for a function that multiplies its argument by 7 .
( This example is not interactive .
See Making a Function Interactive , for that information . )
( defun multiply - by - seven ( number ) " Multiply NUMBER by seven . " (* 7 number ) )
This definition begins with a parenthesis and the symbol defun , followed by the name of the function .
The name of the function is followed by a list that contains the arguments that will be passed to the function .
This list is called the argument list .
In this example , the list has only one element , the symbol , number .
When the function is used , the symbol will be bound to the value that is used as the argument to the function .
Instead of choosing the word number for the name of the argument , I could have picked any other name .
For example , I could have chosen the word multiplicand .
I picked the word “ number ” because it tells what kind of value is intended for this slot ; but I could just as well have chosen the word “ multiplicand ” to indicate the role that the value placed in this slot will play in the workings of the function .
I could have called it foogle , but that would have been a bad choice because it would not tell humans what it means .
The choice of name is up to the programmer and should be chosen to make the meaning of the function clear .
Indeed , you can choose any name you wish for a symbol in an argument list , even the name of a symbol used in some other function : the name you use in an argument list is private to that particular definition .
In that definition , the name refers to a different entity than any use of the same name outside the function definition .
Suppose you have a nick - name “ Shorty ” in your family ; when your family members refer to “ Shorty ” , they mean you .
But outside your family , in a movie , for example , the name “ Shorty ” refers to someone else .
Because a name in an argument list is private to the function definition , you can change the value of such a symbol inside the body of a function without changing its value outside the function .
The effect is similar to that produced by a let expression .
( See let . )
The argument list is followed by the documentation string that describes the function .
This is what you see when you type C-h f and the name of a function .
Incidentally , when you write a documentation string like this , you should make the first line a complete sentence since some commands , such as apropos , print only the first line of a multi-line documentation string .
Also , you should not indent the second line of a documentation string , if you have one , because that looks odd when you use C-h f ( describe - function ) .
The documentation string is optional , but it is so useful , it should be included in almost every function you write .
The third line of the example consists of the body of the function definition .
( Most functions ’ definitions , of course , are longer than this . )
In this function , the body is the list , (* 7 number ) , which says to multiply the value of number by 7 .
( In Emacs Lisp , * is the function for multiplication , just as + is the function for addition . )
When you use the multiply - by - seven function , the argument number evaluates to the actual number you want used .
Here is an example that shows how multiply - by - seven is used ; but do n’t try to evaluate this yet !
( multiply - by - seven 3 )
The symbol number , specified in the function definition in the next section , is bound to the value 3 in the actual use of the function .
Note that although number was inside parentheses in the function definition , the argument passed to the multiply - by - seven function is not in parentheses .
The parentheses are written in the function definition so the computer can figure out where the argument list ends and the rest of the function definition begins .
If you evaluate this example , you are likely to get an error message .
( Go ahead , try it ! )
This is because we have written the function definition , but not yet told the computer about the definition — we have not yet loaded the function definition in Emacs .
Installing a function is the process that tells the Lisp interpreter the definition of the function .
Installation is described in the next section .
3.2 Install a Function Definition
If you are reading this inside of Info in Emacs , you can try out the multiply - by - seven function by first evaluating the function definition and then evaluating ( multiply - by - seven 3 ) .
A copy of the function definition follows .
Place the cursor after the last parenthesis of the function definition and type C-x C-e .
When you do this , multiply - by - seven will appear in the echo area .
( What this means is that when a function definition is evaluated , the value it returns is the name of the defined function . )
At the same time , this action installs the function definition .
( defun multiply - by - seven ( number ) " Multiply NUMBER by seven . " (* 7 number ) )
By evaluating this defun , you have just installed multiply - by - seven in Emacs .
The function is now just as much a part of Emacs as forward - word or any other editing function you use .
( multiply - by - seven will stay installed until you quit Emacs .

The effect of installation
You can see the effect of installing multiply - by - seven by evaluating the following sample .
Place the cursor after the following expression and type C-x C-e .
The number 21 will appear in the echo area .
( multiply - by - seven 3 )
If you wish , you can read the documentation for the function by typing C-h f ( describe - function ) and then the name of the function , multiply - by - seven .
When you do this , a * Help * window will appear on your screen that says :
multiply - by - seven is a Lisp function .
( multiply - by - seven NUMBER ) Multiply NUMBER by seven .
( To return to a single window on your screen , type C-x 1 . )
3.2.1 Change a Function Definition
If you want to change the code in multiply - by - seven , just rewrite it .
To install the new version in place of the old one , evaluate the function definition again .
This is how you modify code in Emacs .
It is very simple .
As an example , you can change the multiply - by - seven function to add the number to itself seven times instead of multiplying the number by seven .
It produces the same answer , but by a different path .
At the same time , we will add a comment to the code ; a comment is text that the Lisp interpreter ignores , but that a human reader may find useful or enlightening .
The comment is that this is the second version .
( defun multiply - by - seven ( number ) ; Second version .
" Multiply NUMBER by seven . " (+ number number number number number number number ) )
The comment follows a semicolon , ‘ ; ’.
In Lisp , everything on a line that follows a semicolon is a comment .
The end of the line is the end of the comment .
To stretch a comment over two or more lines , begin each line with a semicolon .
See Beginning a .emacs File , and Comments in The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual , for more about comments .
You can install this version of the multiply - by - seven function by evaluating it in the same way you evaluated the first function : place the cursor after the last parenthesis and type C-x C-e .
In summary , this is how you write code in Emacs Lisp : you write a function ; install it ; test it ; and then make fixes or enhancements and install it again .
3.3 Make a Function Interactive
You make a function interactive by placing a list that begins with the special form interactive immediately after the documentation .
A user can invoke an interactive function by typing M-x and then the name of the function ; or by typing the keys to which it is bound , for example , by typing C - n for next - line or C- x h for mark - whole - buffer .
Interestingly , when you call an interactive function interactively , the value returned is not automatically displayed in the echo area .
This is because you often call an interactive function for its side effects , such as moving forward by a word or line , and not for the value returned .
If the returned value were displayed in the echo area each time you typed a key , it would be very distracting .
An Interactive multiply - by - seven , An Overview
Both the use of the special form interactive and one way to display a value in the echo area can be illustrated by creating an interactive version of multiply - by - seven .
Here is the code :
( defun multiply - by - seven ( number ) ; Interactive version .
" Multiply NUMBER by seven . " ( interactive " p " ) ( message " The result is % d " (* 7 number ) ) )
You can install this code by placing your cursor after it and typing C-x C-e .
The name of the function will appear in your echo area .
Then , you can use this code by typing C-u and a number and then typing M-x multiply - by - seven and pressing RET .
The phrase ‘
The result is … ’ followed by the product will appear in the echo area .
Speaking more generally , you invoke a function like this in either of two ways :
By typing a prefix argument that contains the number to be passed , and then typing M-x and the name of the function , as with C-u 3 M-x forward - sentence ; or , By typing whatever key or keychord the function is bound to , as with C-u 3 M-e .
Both the examples just mentioned work identically to move point forward three sentences .
( Since multiply - by - seven is not bound to a key , it could not be used as an example of key binding . )
( See Some Keybindings , to learn how to bind a command to a key . )
A prefix argument is passed to an interactive function by typing the META key followed by a number , for example , M - 3 M-e , or by typing C-u and then a number , for example , C- u 3 M-e ( if you type C-u without a number , it defaults to 4 ) .
3.3.1 An Interactive multiply - by - seven
Let ’s look at the use of the special form interactive and then at the function message in the interactive version of multiply - by - seven .
You will recall that the function definition looks like this :
( defun multiply - by - seven ( number ) ; Interactive version .
" Multiply NUMBER by seven . " ( interactive " p " ) ( message " The result is % d " (* 7 number ) ) )
In this function , the expression , ( interactive " p " ) , is a list of two elements .
The " p " tells Emacs to pass the prefix argument to the function and use its value for the argument of the function .
The argument will be a number .
This means that the symbol number will be bound to a number in the line :
( message " The result is % d " (* 7 number ) )
For example , if your prefix argument is 5 , the Lisp interpreter will evaluate the line as if it were :
( message " The result is % d " (* 7 5 ) )
( If you are reading this in GNU Emacs , you can evaluate this expression yourself . )
First , the interpreter will evaluate the inner list , which is (* 7 5 ) .
This returns a value of 35 .
Next , it will evaluate the outer list , passing the values of the second and subsequent elements of the list to the function message .
As we have seen , message is an Emacs Lisp function especially designed for sending a one line message to a user .
( See The message function . )
In summary , the message function prints its first argument in the echo area as is , except for occurrences of ‘ %d ’ or ‘ %s ’ ( and various other % - sequences which we have not mentioned ) .
When it sees a control sequence , the function looks to the second or subsequent arguments and prints the value of the argument in the location in the string where the control sequence is located .
In the interactive multiply - by - seven function , the control string is ‘ %d ’ , which requires a number , and the value returned by evaluating (* 7 5 ) is the number 35 .
Consequently , the number 35 is printed in place of the ‘ %d ’ and the message is ‘ The result is 35 ’.
( Note that when you call the function multiply - by - seven , the message is printed without quotes , but when you call message , the text is printed in double quotes .
This is because the value returned by message is what appears in the echo area when you evaluate an expression whose first element is message ; but when embedded in a function , message prints the text as a side effect without quotes . )
3.4 Different Options for interactive
In the example , multiply - by - seven used " p " as the argument to interactive .
This argument told Emacs to interpret your typing either C-u followed by a number or META followed by a number as a command to pass that number to the function as its argument .
Emacs has more than twenty characters predefined for use with interactive .
In almost every case , one of these options will enable you to pass the right information interactively to a function .
( See Code Characters for interactive in The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual . )
Consider the function zap - to - char .
Its interactive expression is
( interactive " p
cZap to char : " )
The first part of the argument to interactive is ‘ p ’ , with which you are already familiar .
This argument tells Emacs to interpret a prefix , as a number to be passed to the function .
You can specify a prefix either by typing C-u followed by a number or by typing META followed by a number .
The prefix is the number of specified characters .
Thus , if your prefix is three and the specified character is ‘ x ’ , then you will delete all the text up to and including the third next ‘ x ’.
If you do not set a prefix , then you delete all the text up to and including the specified character , but no more .
The ‘ c ’ tells the function the name of the character to which to delete .
More formally , a function with two or more arguments can have information passed to each argument by adding parts to the string that follows interactive .
When you do this , the information is passed to each argument in the same order it is specified in the interactive list .
In the string , each part is separated from the next part by a ‘
’ , which is a newline .
For example , you can follow ‘ p ’ with a ‘
’ and an ‘ cZap to char : ’.
This causes Emacs to pass the value of the prefix argument ( if there is one ) and the character .
In this case , the function definition looks like the following , where arg and char are the symbols to which interactive binds the prefix argument and the specified character :
( defun name - of - function ( arg char ) " documentation … " ( interactive " p
cZap to char : " ) body - of - function … )
( The space after the colon in the prompt makes it look better when you are prompted .
See The Definition of copy - to - buffer , for an example . )
When a function does not take arguments , interactive does not require any .
Such a function contains the simple expression ( interactive ) .
The mark - whole - buffer function is like this .
Alternatively , if the special letter - codes are not right for your application , you can pass your own arguments to interactive as a list .
See The Definition of append - to - buffer , for an example .
See Using Interactive in The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual , for a more complete explanation about this technique .
3.5 Install Code Permanently
When you install a function definition by evaluating it , it will stay installed until you quit Emacs .
The next time you start a new session of Emacs , the function will not be installed unless you evaluate the function definition again .
At some point , you may want to have code installed automatically whenever you start a new session of Emacs .
There are several ways of doing this :
If you have code that is just for yourself , you can put the code for the function definition in your .emacs initialization file .
When you start Emacs , your .emacs file is automatically evaluated and all the function definitions within it are installed .
See Your .emacs File .
initialization file .
When you start Emacs , your file is automatically evaluated and all the function definitions within it are installed .
See Your File .
Alternatively , you can put the function definitions that you want installed in one or more files of their own and use the load function to cause Emacs to evaluate and thereby install each of the functions in the files .
See Loading Files .
function to cause Emacs to evaluate and thereby install each of the functions in the files .
See Loading Files .
Thirdly , if you have code that your whole site will use , it is usual to put it in a file called site - init.el that is loaded when Emacs is built .
This makes the code available to everyone who uses your machine .
( See the INSTALL file that is part of the Emacs distribution . )
Finally , if you have code that everyone who uses Emacs may want , you can post it on a computer network or send a copy to the Free Software Foundation .
( When you do this , please license the code and its documentation under a license that permits other people to run , copy , study , modify , and redistribute the code and which protects you from having your work taken from you . )
If you send a copy of your code to the Free Software Foundation , and properly protect yourself and others , it may be included in the next release of Emacs .
In large part , this is how Emacs has grown over the past years , by donations .
3.6 let
The let expression is a special form in Lisp that you will need to use in most function definitions .
let is used to attach or bind a symbol to a value in such a way that the Lisp interpreter will not confuse the variable with a variable of the same name that is not part of the function .
To understand why the let special form is necessary , consider the situation in which you own a home that you generally refer to as “ the house ” , as in the sentence , “ The house needs painting . ”
If you are visiting a friend and your host refers to “ the house ” , he is likely to be referring to his house , not yours , that is , to a different house .
If your friend is referring to his house and you think he is referring to your house , you may be in for some confusion .
The same thing could happen in Lisp if a variable that is used inside of one function has the same name as a variable that is used inside of another function , and the two are not intended to refer to the same value .
The let special form prevents this kind of confusion .
let Prevents Confusion
The let special form prevents confusion .
let creates a name for a local variable that overshadows any use of the same name outside the let expression .
This is like understanding that whenever your host refers to “ the house ” , he means his house , not yours .
( Symbols used in argument lists work the same way .
See The defun Macro . )
Local variables created by a let expression retain their value only within the let expression itself ( and within expressions called within the let expression ) ; the local variables have no effect outside the let expression .
Another way to think about let is that it is like a setq that is temporary and local .
The values set by let are automatically undone when the let is finished .
The setting only affects expressions that are inside the bounds of the let expression .
In computer science jargon , we would say the binding of a symbol is visible only in functions called in the let form ; in Emacs Lisp , the default scoping is dynamic , not lexical .
( The non - default lexical binding is not discussed in this manual . )
let can create more than one variable at once .
Also , let gives each variable it creates an initial value , either a value specified by you , or nil .
( In the jargon , this is binding the variable to the value . )
After let has created and bound the variables , it executes the code in the body of the let , and returns the value of the last expression in the body , as the value of the whole let expression .
( “ Execute ” is a jargon term that means to evaluate a list ; it comes from the use of the word meaning “ to give practical effect to ” ( Oxford English Dictionary ) .
Since you evaluate an expression to perform an action , “ execute ” has evolved as a synonym to “ evaluate ” . )
3.6.1 The Parts of a let Expression
A let expression is a list of three parts .
The first part is the symbol let .
The second part is a list , called a varlist , each element of which is either a symbol by itself or a two - element list , the first element of which is a symbol .
The third part of the let expression is the body of the let .
The body usually consists of one or more lists .
A template for a let expression looks like this :
( let varlist body …)
The symbols in the varlist are the variables that are given initial values by the let special form .
Symbols by themselves are given the initial value of nil ; and each symbol that is the first element of a two - element list is bound to the value that is returned when the Lisp interpreter evaluates the second element .
Thus , a varlist might look like this : ( thread ( needles 3 ) ) .
In this case , in a let expression , Emacs binds the symbol thread to an initial value of nil , and binds the symbol needles to an initial value of 3 .
When you write a let expression , what you do is put the appropriate expressions in the slots of the let expression template .
If the varlist is composed of two - element lists , as is often the case , the template for the let expression looks like this :
( let ( ( variable value ) ( variable value ) … ) body …)
3.6.2 Sample let Expression
The following expression creates and gives initial values to the two variables zebra and tiger .
The body of the let expression is a list which calls the message function .
( let ( ( zebra " stripes " ) ( tiger " fierce " ) ) ( message " One kind of animal has %s and another is % s. " zebra tiger ) )
Here , the varlist is ( ( zebra " stripes " ) ( tiger " fierce " ) ) .
The two variables are zebra and tiger .
Each variable is the first element of a two - element list and each value is the second element of its two - element list .
In the varlist , Emacs binds the variable zebra to the value " stripes " 9 , and binds the variable tiger to the value " fierce " .
In this example , both values are strings .
The values could just as well have been another list or a symbol .
The body of the let follows after the list holding the variables .
In this example , the body is a list that uses the message function to print a string in the echo area .
You may evaluate the example in the usual fashion , by placing the cursor after the last parenthesis and typing C-x C-e .
When you do this , the following will appear in the echo area :
" One kind of animal has stripes and another is fierce . "
As we have seen before , the message function prints its first argument , except for ‘ %s ’.
In this example , the value of the variable zebra is printed at the location of the first ‘ %s ’ and the value of the variable tiger is printed at the location of the second ‘ %s ’.
3.6.3 Uninitialized Variables in a let Statement
If you do not bind the variables in a let statement to specific initial values , they will automatically be bound to an initial value of nil , as in the following expression :
( let ( ( birch 3 ) pine fir ( oak ' some ) ) ( message " Here are %d variables with %s , %s , and %s value . " birch pine fir oak ) )
Here , the varlist is ( ( birch 3 ) pine fir ( oak ' some ) ) .
If you evaluate this exp

IT IS not difficult to be pessimistic about the future of European business .
Compared with the awesome strength of America and the raw power of emerging Asia , Europe is sometimes portrayed as a has - been , excelling in luxury goods , fine food , wines and fashion but weighed down by too many old industries and old ideas .
From microchips to microbes , poor old Europe seems to trail in America 's and Asia 's wake .
America enjoys awesome advantages over Europe .
It is a huge , truly single market with a relatively youthful , growing population .
It is the world 's economic superpower , with much higher productivity than its competitors ( though productivity growth has recently been disappointing , and last year was slightly below Europe's ) .
It has world - class universities that work hand in glove with business .
Americans have not only won more Nobel prizes , they have turned more scientific advances into profitable businesses than anyone else .
Many of these firms have gone on to become the giants of modern business .
It may have been a British scientist , Sir Tim Berners - Lee , working at a laboratory in Switzerland , who invented the world wide web , but America is the home of the internet and all the business sectors it has spawned .
And even where Europe is holding its own against America , it seems unable to retain its advantage .
Boeing drifted badly in the 1990s as Europe 's Airbus made strides , but having merged with McDonnell Douglas the American giant bounced back .
It is now taking market share from the Europeans .
America 's economic growth , averaging 2.5 % a year since 2001 , has reflected this dynamic business culture , whereas Europe has managed an average growth rate of barely 1.5 % over the same period , though the pace has picked up in the past year .
Europe 's sluggish performance is often put down to the poor business climate .
Rigid labour laws and strong unions make it difficult for firms to fire redundant workers and unattractive to hire new ones .
Product markets are not as competitive as America's , and the single European market has yet to become a reality in areas such as banking and services .
Corporate governance too is variable : transparent and world - class in Britain , but often inadequate in continental Europe .
In Germany workers sit on boards , and in France even small firms have to have an employees ' committee that can make life difficult for management .
Minority shareholders do not always get enough say .
Moreover , European governments like to meddle .
France has drawn up a list of strategic industries , including casinos , that it thinks need special protection from foreign takeovers .
Even Spain , with its new Anglo - Saxon business culture , tried to stop a German utility from taking over a Spanish power company .
Telecom Italia 's attempts to hive off its mobile - phone business became highly politicised .
Many European politicians are fearful about the effects of globalisation and the rise of China and India .
France 's vote against the European constitution in 2005 was partly a protest against globalisation , which is blamed for persistently high unemployment there .
Certainly Asia has been making itself more strongly felt in Europe in recent years .
Japan now has car factories in France and the Czech Republic as well as in Britain , and imports from South Korea 's resurgent car industry have been causing difficulties at Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën .
India 's Tata Group too is planning to export cars to some southern and eastern European markets where they will provide more competition for the traditional west European manufacturers .
Europe 's pride
Yet even though European business has to operate in a difficult political , social and economic environment , it has produced an impressive crop of world - class companies .
An analysis by McKinsey , a management consultancy , shows that Europe has 29 % of the world 's leading 2,000 or so companies , broadly in line with its 30 % share of world GDP .
It punches its weight in most global industries except IT , where America is leagues ahead ( see chart 1 ) .
British companies were pioneers of globalisation , perhaps because of Britain 's open Anglo - Saxon business culture and financial system .
More recently Britain's BP bought several American oil companies , triggering a wave of oil mergers in America and Europe .
But then Britain is closer than its European cousins to the freewheeling American business model , which is why this special report will concentrate mainly on continental Europe .
Over the past few years those continental European countries have been gradually shedding their old corporatism and learning new tricks from the Anglo - Saxons .
Jeff Immelt , who succeeded Jack Welch at the helm of GE five years ago , is struck by the vast improvement in European top management in recent years .
As he points out , most big European businesses are now successfully global .
The figures bear out Mr Immelt 's impressions .
Kevin Gardiner , head of global equity strategy at HSBC , an investment bank , who first spotted the Celtic Tiger miracle of the Irish economy a decade ago , has recently made another remarkable discovery : European businesses are making better profits than their American counterparts ( see chart 2 ) .
He notes that “ currently European companies seem to be slightly more profitable even than their American peers . ”
This has been achieved even though revenues have been growing more slowly than in America , which underscores Europe 's growing success in restructuring and consolidation .
Corporate America and corporate Europe are now neck and neck in the globalisation stakes .
Dominic Casserley at McKinsey 's London office also takes a bullish view .
“ Write off Europe at your peril , ” he says .
“ In many sectors European companies are clearly in the premier league .
We see a generation of strong European management teams emerging who are aggressive , hungry and eager to expand . ”
Some of this revitalisation of European business is due to the impetus from a more open trading system in a global economy .
European companies , small as well as large , have quietly got on with moving many of their operations abroad where it makes economic sense to do so .
But two other powerful forces are also at work .
One is the structural change now taking place in Germany .
After years of languishing , Europe 's biggest economy is beginning to feel the benefit of reforms , particularly to its financial system .
The other force is a gush of private - equity finance , much of it originating in America and landing in Europe .
This started only a few years ago , but already private - equity and venture capital invested in Europe totals € 173 billion ( $ 225 billion ) and is growing by leaps and bounds .
Donald Gogel , the boss of Clayton , Dubilier & Rice , an American private - equity firm , sums up the benefits : better governance ; a more stable shareholder base ; upgraded management talent ; higher expectations ; and a sense of urgency .
Private equity gives the owners of the business direct control over its performance .
If managers succeed , they earn a lot of money .
If they fail to perform , they are replaced .
Americans have known all this for a while , but Europeans are learning it fast .
This special report will ask how European companies , large and small , are coping with global competition .
It will examine the boom in cross - border mergers and takeovers in Europe and look at the fundamental changes in German business .
And it will argue that European business is better than its reputation .

SUMMARY
Ontologies are enabling technology for the Semantic Web .
They are a means for people to state what they mean by the terms used in data that they might generate , share , or consume .
Folksonomies are an emergent phenomenon of the Social Web .
They arise from data about how people associate terms with content that they generate , share , or consume .
Recently the two ideas have been put into opposition , as if they were right and left poles of a political spectrum .
This is a false dichotomy ; they are more like apples and oranges .
In fact , as the Semantic Web matures and the Social Web grows , there is increasing value in applying Semantic Web technologies to the data of the Social Web .
This article is an attempt to clarify the distinct roles for ontologies and folksonomies , and previews some new work that applies the two ideas together – an ontology of folksonomy .
ONTOLOGY AS ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR SHARING INFORMATION
A while ago , the Artificial Intelligence research community got together to find a way to “ enable knowledge sharing ” ( Neches et al. , 1991 ) .
They were n’t talking about writing papers or going to conferences ; they wanted their computer programs to be able to interact with and build on the information from other computer programs .
They proposed an infrastructure stack that could enable this level of information exchange , and began work on the very difficult problems that arise .
Ten years later , Tim Berners - Lee articulated a wonderful vision of how this might all work on the Web – the Semantic Web ( Berners - Lee , 2001 ) .
Today the idea that web - resident programs can interoperate with and build on each other ’s data is widely accepted .
In the context of the Semantic Web , “ ontology ” is an enabling technology — a layer of the enabling infrastructure — for information sharing and manipulation .
The approach is simple : parties who have software / data / services to offer identify some common conceptualization of the data ; they specify that conceptualization as clearly they can ; they build systems that interoperate on those specifications .
This is standard - issue information technology , with the twist that ontologies are specifications of the conceptualizations at a semantic level ( Gruber , 1993 ) .
Other layers of the stack ( other ways of enabling information sharing ) include standard data formats , APIs , and sharing reference implementations of code that define the semantics of the APIs and data operationally .
FOLKSONOMY AS DATA THAT IS EMERGENT FROM SHARED INFORMATION
Not so long ago , keen observers of the Internet ( Vander Wal , 2004 ) , ( Sterling , 2005 ) , ( Mieszkowski , 2005 ) and inventors of social software ( Shachter , 2003 ) , ( Fake and Butterfield , 2003 ) began to notice that people who do n’t write computer programs were happily “ tagging ” with keywords the content they created or encountered .
Of course , keyword tagging is nothing new ; the interesting observation is that when these folks do their tagging in a public space , the collection of their keyword / value associations becomes a useful source of data in the aggregate .
Hence the term “ folksonomy ” – the emergent labeling of lots of things by people in a social context .
Thomas Vander Wal , who is credited with the term , emphasizes that the resulting folksonomy is not a taxonomy or even a collaborative categorization ( Vander Wal , 2004 ) .
At least that was the original observation and intent for the term .
Today , tagging is a widespread phenomenon popularized by applications such as social bookmarking ( Del.icio.us ) and social photo sharing ( Flickr ) .
In these applications , the emergent data from the actions of millions of ordinary , untrained folk doing things for their own local interests is rather useful .
For bookmarking , tagging helps to counter the spam - induced noise in search engines , and for photo sharing , tagging gives those text - based search engines a fighting chance .
COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
Like all vague but evocative terms , both of the words ontology and folksonomy have taken on many senses .
Given the frustration with how hard it is to share data at a semantic level and the delightful observation about how much value can come “ for free ” from bottom up tagging , it was inevitable that the terms would be compared as alternatives .
In a widely - read blog post , Clay Shirky ( 2005 ) makes the argument that “ ontology is overrated ” and tags are “ a radical break with previous categorization strategies … much more organic ways of organizing information than our current categorization schemes allow . ”
Equating ontology with information organization , he illustrates how hierarchical , centrally controlled taxonomic categorization schemes are limited , and how free - form , massively distributed tagging is resilient against several of these limitations .
I think he ’s right on both counts .
Yes , folksonomies are interesting in contrast to taxonomies .
Taxonomies limit the dimensions along which one can make distinctions , and local choices at the leaves are constrained by global categorizations in the branches .
It is therefore inherently difficult to put things in their hierarchical places , and the categories are often forced .
Folksonomies are massively dimensional ( one dimension per potential term , as in full - text indexing ) , and there is no global consistency imposed by current practice .
Things are easy to tag — there is no wrong answer — and the emergent patterns give insight into collective attention .
The only problem with the anti-ontology blog , is , as my friend put it : “ He misses the point … so beautifully . ”
The problem is that the blog , like much of the popular writing on ontology , confuses ontology - as - specified - conceptualization with a very narrow form of specification ( the taxonomic classification ) and a very specific methodology for agreeing on a conceptualization ( centrally controlled categorization ) .
One of the examples of taxonomy cited is the Dewey Decimal System .
Of course , it is difficult to categorize everything in the world according to the Dewey Decimal System .
As Shirky points out , it was designed to manage book shelves in the eighteenth century .
( Notice the word design ; the DDS is an organizational system , not a model of the world ’s knowledge . )
You could try to build an ontology of all the world ’s knowledge , and some people still do , but not for locating books .
Today ’s scholarly researchers use search engines ( where every word is a tag ) and index reference materials ( with domain specific , controlled vocabularies , organized non-hierarchically ) to find works on a subject .
And today ’s curators of books and other cultural artifacts are designing ontologies - as - conceptual - specifications that enable multiple , independently developed databases of carefully categorized artifacts to interoperate , and for agents to reason about the differences among the vocabulary used in each of those independent databases ( International Council of Museums , 2006 ) .
The attack on “ ontology ” is really an attack on top down categorization as a way of finding and organizing information , and the praise for folksonomy is really the observation that we now have an entirely new source of data for finding and organizing information : user participation .
For the task of finding information , taxonomies are too rigid and purely text - based search is too weak .
Tags introduce distributed human intelligence into the system .
As others have pointed out , Google ’s revolution in search quality began when it incorporated a measure of “ popular ” acclaim — the hyperlink — as evidence that a page ought to be associated with a query .
When the early webmasters were manually creating directories of interesting sites relevant to their interests , they were implicitly “ voting with their links . ”
Today , as the adopters of tagging systems enthusiastically label their bookmarks and photos , they are implicitly voting with their tags .
This is , indeed , “ radical ” in the political sense , and clearly a source of power to exploit .
LET’S SHARE TAGS
Yes , we agree , tags are cool .
I am a big fan of collective intelligence , and have personally experienced the power of collaborative tagging .
With my collaborators at RealTravel , we have built a “ Web 2.0 ” product that has user contributed content , social networking , and tagging .
I would like to join forces with my colleagues in the tagging community ( TagCamp , 2005 ) to help build the infrastructure that will enable systems like RealTravel to interoperate in an ecosystem of data sources , services , agents , and tools that combine and add value to the tagging done by all these users .
How do we do this ?
You guessed : create an ontology for folksonomy .
Let ’s start by clarifying our purposes .
After all , this is an engineering design effort — not an exercise in categorizing the world ’s content .
Consider two use cases .
Use Case 1 : Collaborative Tagging Across Multiple Applications
Today we can tag our photos on Flickr and use tags for bookmarking in Del.icio.us .
We can look up blogs on Technorati by tags .
I want to tag the content I find on any application , and I want the benefit of others ’ tags across these applications .
This means that there must be some way of reasoning about the equivalence or relationship among tagging data across applications .
For example , let ’s say I write a blog about my trip to Bali on my favorite travel site .
I tag it with the labels that categorize my trip for travel ( “ adventure ” “ culture ” “ diving ” etc. ) and the travel site can tag it automatically with things like the places I visited ( “ Bali ” “ Ubud ” etc. ) and my screen name .
If I use Flickr photos in that travel blog , I want to display existing Flickr tags when those photos are shown in the context of the travel blog ( “ lotusflower ” “ beach ” etc. ) .
I want to put the travel - related tags onto the Flickr photos , so the Flickr audience can automatically know that the lotus flower was in Ubud , and vice versa , so the travel site audience can find pictures of beaches in Bali .
When my blog is syndicated through the Net , I want it joining forces with other blogs in Technorati or Del.icio.us or other aggregators , where the whole world can get focused streams of fresh , authentic , user - contributed content about places they want to visit and things they want to do .
Tagging across various and varied applications , both existent and to be created , requires that we make it possible to exchange , compare , and reason about the tag data without any one application owning the “ tag space ” or folksonomy .
Use Case 2 : Collaborative Filtering Based on Tagging
Google is great , but it takes work sorting through all the noise .
Why should I have to repeat the effort if others have already gone through it ?
When I enter the term “ folksonomy ” into a search engine I want to be able to see results that lots of others have tagged with folksonomy .
I want to find Shirk ’s and Vander Wal ’s writing right away because other people have implicitly marked them as required reading .
If some spammer has attempted to hijack the popular tag , I want the masses to reject him with their tagging .
I want to be told , without knowing to ask , that the term “ folksonomy ” correlates with the term “ tagging ” , because people have tagged the same things with both tags .
I want to go to Rojo and see which blogs tagged with this word are most read , across all major blogging systems .
Ideally , I want to see what my colleagues around the world have tagged as such , using whatever tagging system they choose .
More generally , when I do knowledge work on the web , I want to take advantage of all the other work other people have done .
I want to discover other people doing the same work , perhaps to share or connect up .
This is the vision that launched the Web , and it drives the goal of accelerating human knowledge and understanding .
What does it take ?
Again , this use case requires that there be a common conceptualization of what tagging means and at least some way for a service to correlate or connect tag data from one application to another .
How to proceed ?
I doubt there will ever be a single , standardized way to collect , interpret , or use tag data .
But we can build the substrate for an ecosystem of tagging that will lets us innovate and work toward the vision of an open tagosphere .
I argue that ontology is core to this effect .
We identify a common conceptualization , and work out a specification at the semantic level .
We identify and build systems that commit to the specifications at various levels of commitment , and hook up the ecosystem .
In particular , we come up with a conceptualization of tagging that enables the power we want while allowing innovation in implementation , optimization , and extension .
We hash out those concepts that are clear , and try to make unambiguous definitions for terms .
We identify those concepts that are vague , and set out to clarify them .
And we lay out a conceptual framework for identifying those areas where systems will differ .
Ontologies are as much about reasoning about incompatibilities as about finding commonalities .
A TAG ONTOLOGY – SOME DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
With this vision and these sorts of use cases in mind , a group of people from the tagging community are beginning to work on a common ontology for tagging – the TagOntology ( Gruber , 2005 ) .
( Note : this is not about developing a common folksonomy – a common set of words to use when tagging .
For example , the ontology will not include terms for labeling documents under topics of science or business ; it will not be for modeling particular domains such as geography or photography . )
The TagOntology is about identifying and formalizing a conceptualization of the activity of tagging , and building technology that commits to the ontology at the semantic level .
The community is also working on enabling infrastructure at the levels of formats , data models , and APIs .
The larger approach is to create a coherent stack from conception to implementation that fosters innovation at all levels .
Let us focus on the ontology layer here .
If developing ontologies is like engineering design ( Gruber , 1995 ) , what are some of the design problems facing us ?
I will offer a flavor for the issues here , and offer some preliminary analysis .
The actual work to hammer out solutions is collaborative and ongoing .
The Core Concept : Tagging
To enable the use cases described above , the core idea of tagging must account for the full environment of social tagging .
From the user ’s point of view , tagging is an activity in which you label some content you create or experience with one or more labels , or tags .
So one might be tempted to formalize it as the two - place relation
Tagging ( object , tag )
This is fine if you live in a closed world .
But to enable collaborative filtering , you need some notion of tagger – the person or agent doing the tagging .
So we need to represent the tagger in our relation , as so :
Tagging ( object , tag , tagger )
Now we have to think about how these data might be shared .
You ca n’t leave this implicit at the inter-application level .
For example , if two applications modeled their tag data using the three - place relation , when they pooled or exchanged their data , it might look like this :
Tagging ( Object1 , tag1 , tagger1 ) // by system 1
Tagging ( Object1 , tag2 , tagger1 ) // by system 1
Tagging ( Object1 , tag1 , tagger2 ) // by system 1
Tagging ( Object1 , tag3 , tagger3 ) // by system 2
Tagging ( Object2 , tag1 , tagger4 ) // by system 2
where the first three facts are from the first system and the rest are from the other system .
If we are to compare data from different systems , we ca n’t assume that they all have exactly the same sets of objects , tags , and taggers .
Thus , we need to make explicit some notion of source , which you can think of as the scope of namespaces or universe of quantification for these objects .
( I am tempted to think of source in terms of community , but that is an application - specific interpretation . )
So now we have a four - place relation , with source as a formal term :
Tagging ( Object1 , tag1 , tagger1 , source1 )
Tagging ( Object1 , tag2 , tagger1 , source1 )
Tagging ( Object1 , tag1 , tagger2 , source1 )
Tagging ( Object1 , tag3 , tagger3 , source2 )
Tagging ( Object2 , tag1 , tagger4 , source2 )
This allows us to say something about a collection of tag data , independent of the specific applications they come from .
Constraints on “ tagging ”
To make any valid conclusions from the merged or exchanged data , we need an ontological commitment to the semantics of tagging and its three parties .
First , consider the criterion of internal coherence ( Gruber , 1995 ) for the relation itself .
First is the notion that a single tagger “ votes ” with its tag , and you can only vote once .
That is , if tag1 = tag2 , then there is no difference between the first and second assertions above ; they are logically redundant and you could go on asserting them forever without adding any information .
( You can state this various ways with inference rules or axioms , but they all amount to the single vote idea . )
This is an excellent example of why systems need to make ontological commitments at the semantic level , aside from any agreements on formats ( Gruber , 1993 ) .
If one system gave different meaning to repeated assertions of the tagging relation , then it would be logically inconsistent to combine their data .
A second notion intrinsic to tagging is that things - that - are - tagged play a role in the meaning of tagging that is different from the tag or the tagger .
One of the proposals on the table of the TagOntology discussion is whether one can tag a tag .
Of course , one can make a system to store these tuples , but the meaning is not clear on the tagging relation as it stands .
In particular , the Tagging relation is not symmetric : you ca n’t swap tagger and tagged roles and preserve the meaning of a tagging assertion .
So to clarify the meaning of tagging , we would design a different sort of relation or family for “ metatagging ” or whatever it might be called .
One system might use a tag - on - tag notion to mean “ this tag is a synonym of that tag ” and another system might have a notion of “ this tag represents a cluster of other tags ” .
There is no requirement that all systems share the same notions ; a successful knowledge sharing agreement only requires that they clearly identify the differences when they share data .
Negative Tagging
Now consider how to handle the collaborative filtering of “ bad ” tags from spammers .
How does a crowd “ out vote ” a spammer ?
It turns out this requires negative tagging – asserting that a tag should not apply to an object .
What is a minimal commitment for negative tagging ?
One could model the negative tagging assertion as literally a negation : “ it is not true that tagger1 tagged object2 with tag3 ” .
However , representing important facts as logical sentences rather than relations leads to all sorts of computational deep water .
It becomes rather difficult to prove , in general , whether a tagging has occurred .
It is also tempting to try to assign some kind of evidential weight to the statement , but this has similar problems in trying to reason about tagging .
If we can refrain from the temptation to do too much , it is perfectly reasonable to simply add another argument to the relation – a polarity argument .
This would bring us to a five - place relation :
Tagging ( object , tag , tagger , source , + or -)
To give this meaning , we can write the constraint that you only get one “ vote ” , either positive or negative .
Again , there are fancy ways to say this in logic but I think English does a pretty good job .
You can distinguish between what it would mean for someone to “ untag ” something as opposed to changing their polarity .
Similarly , you can write “ default logic ” inference rules .
For now , we are content with statements such as “ if you do n’t give a polarity , it defaults to positive ) .
Although informally specified , this is still an ontological commitment at the semantic level : you can reason about pools of facts of the form Tagging ( object , tag , tagger , source ) and Tagging ( object , tag , tagger , source , polarity ) .
If one system uses the four place version and another uses the five place relation , the five - place system can infer that the four places are equivalent to five place variants with “ + ” for value of polarity .
Because of a shared ontology , systems with negative tagging can share data with those that do not support the notion , and third party agents that can understand and reconcile the differences .
Tag Identity
Finally , the ontology needs formal definitions of identity for each of its core concepts : object , tag , tagger , and source .
In other words , when interpreting a set of tagging data , how do we know when two objects , tags , taggers , or sources are the same ?
The Semantic Web ( and RDF ) offers a convenient pattern for registering namespaces using URIs .
For example , it is not hard to imagine allowing anything with a URI to be the object of a tagging assertion .
However , what about tags ?
Is case sensitive in names ?
White space ?
Are these semantic level issues or just implementation details ?
It is clear that different tagging systems today handle the input , output , and matching of tag phrases differently .
However , we believe it is possible to formalize a conceptualization that factors out these differences clearly , so that third party agents can reason about the differences .
One technique is to represent a function from names to tags .
For example
f ( " san francisco " ) = tag1
f ( " San Francisco " ) = tag2
f ( " sanfrancisco " ) = tag3
Then one can write clear axioms that define how a particular system handles the name matching .
One might say that tag1 = tag2 , another that tag2 = tag3 , and so forth .
It is also possible to model the function the other way , that a given tag has a canonical name cname ( tag ) =” string ” .
Then differences among surface forms of tags are bounded within the application ( i.e. , do n’t care how tags are entered and displayed within the application , but insist that any export of the tag data to other systems only uses the canonical name ) .
Similar issues arise for the scope of identifiers for taggers – should they be relative to the source or be required to be universally scoped by something like a URI ?
If they are scoped by URI , do they also have surface string names ( “ screen names ” ) that can be matched by third party systems , and by what rules of identity ?
Does source represent a set of taggers or something else ?
Is there any portability of identity across applications , and if so , by what mechanism ( central registry , coincidental string match , FOAF ( Miller & Brickley , 2005 ) , etc. ) .
CONCLUSION
In this article I have tried to lay out some of the issues and challenges for designing a specification of tag concepts that might enable services for analyzing and reasoning over tag data across applications .
This article was originally written in November of 2005 , and the tag ontology introduced here remains work in progress .
The process for developing the ontology is open , with a working group operating under the name tagcommons.org .
If you are interested in contributing , please visit tagcommons.org and sign up .
That site contains links to ongoing work , proposals , and working group discussions .
What is more important than a specific ontology , however , is the more general notion that techniques of the Semantic Web , such as formal specification of structured data and reasoning across disparate data sources , can apply to the Social Web .
Tagging data offers an interesting window into the intersection of formal reasoning ( logical inference , database query processing , linguistic parsing ) and semistructured data with context - dependent semantics ( labels and groupings of content , people ’s online identities ) .
Tag assertions mean different things in different applications , yet they do not have to have a unified semantics to be comparable across sources .
The process of developing a tag data ontology forces us to identify the kinds of ontological assumptions made by various source of tag data , and to specify a vocabulary for stating those assumptions .
With a tag data ontology , or similar ontologies for other social data , we might enable technologies for searching , aggregating , and connecting the people and content they contribute throughout the Web .
At the same time , the rich data from millions of active , participating human beings might offer fuel for the development of systems that tap the power of collective intelligence ( Engelbart , 1963 ) .

The third edition in our collection of Obesity Paradoxes addresses the leading cause of death in the
United States
: heart disease .
The CDC reports we ’re most likely to die of heart disease than anything else .
But research just published in the American Heart Journal found you are 2 1 / 2 times less likely to die of acute heart failure if you are obese when you ’re hospitalized than if you are “ normal weight ! ”
UCLA researchers analyzed the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry and the more than 108,000 cases of acute heart failure that had been hospitalized in 263 hospitals across the country from October 2001 through December 2004 .
Despite adjusting for every contributing factor , age , gender , lab work and other health indice , they found that for every 5 unit increase in body mass index ( BMI ) the risk of dying dropped by 10 percent .
Actual mortality rates for the “ normal ” weight patients was 6.3 compared with 2.4 for the most “ obese . ”
This is not a fluke finding , as the researchers specifically note that “ prior studies on chronic heart failure have demonstrated that body mass index is inversely associated with mortality , the so - called obesity paradox . ”
Slug world divided
It is 50 million years from now , and slugs rule the Earth .
If this sounds funny , imagine how the dinosaurs laughed at the first puny furballs we call " mammals " .
Slugs are already everywhere and they 're probably already better organised than we think .
So then , about 1.6 petaseconds from now , slugs rule the Earth .
We come across them in a Golden Age of slug science , in which slugtech and slugmed hold great promise for eradicating poverty , hardship and illness throughout the world .
However the face of the Earth has changed : continents have twirled and glided in their tectonic dance and now form just two large landmasses , on opposite sides of the planet .
As slugs live longer , populations boom and space is scarce .
The societies of each continent eye the other 's land greedily .
Slug State A ( SSA ) has heard rumours that Slug State B ( SSB ) has developed a terrifying new weapon — the Inter - Continental Salty Missile , or ICSM for short — and it too begins a programme of rapid research and construction of ICSMs .
Each missile is capable of delivering a Pinch of Salt from one continent to the other and releasing it over a city , causing many thousands of slugs to shrivel and die .
What 's worse , slugtech is based on compounds which react in a similar way to slugs themselves : an ICSM strike will not only kill slugs , but wipe out buildings and ICSMs on the ground .
It is soon clear that both sides are accelerating the build - up of their arsenals , which leads some slugs to point out that were a Salty War ever to take place , practically every slug on Earth would die .
Moreover , in this Brave New World , war is n't declared in the old - fashioned way : SSB could launch a sneaky attack against SSA and wipe out all of its ICSMs before SSA had a chance to respond .
SSB 's victory would be total .
But SSB also fears a sneak attack from SSA , so how can each state ensure that enough ICSMs survive such an attack to inflict unacceptable damage on the attacker ?
Some slugs claim that introducing a weapon to neutralise incoming ICSMs — the so - called Spoonful of Sugar ( SoS ) — or carrying multiple Pinches of Salt in each missile ( MPSMs ) will prompt each state to increase their arsenal .
Is this true ?
What about protective coverings for ICSMs on the ground , the newly - invented CandyFloss ?
The right answer to such a question could save many slugs ; the wrong one could be disastrous .
Maths to the rescue
A definitive answer to such questions is difficult for us , never mind the slugs .
However , some simple graphical arguments can shed a lot of light on the problems involved .
Graphical methods can be useful for mathematicians to get to grips with a complex problem : they can provide strikingly simple ways of depicting complex behaviour , and are also capable of representing complex and copious data in a straightforward way .
Moreover , they call on the brain 's natural pattern - finding abilities .
One of the simplest patterns is a straight line , and it is possible to change the way data is represented to see if a straight line emerges , and then figure out what this means .
Graphical representation of data or behaviour allows for rapid assimilation of the " big picture " and enables one to employ geometric intuition which can lead to physical deductions .
There are obvious limitation to the use of graphical methods ( for example , they work best when there are only a few variables to consider , and drawing graphs in more than three dimensions can be awkward ) , but their widespread use in problems of physics , chemistry , biology , statistics , and more proves their utility .
We begin by letting x and y be the number of ICSMs possessed by SSA and SSB , respectively .
We 're going to cheat a little bit — all in a good cause — and treat x and y as if they were real numbers , rather than the integers they are .
Since we are dealing with large numbers , the percentage error associated with treating them as real numbers is quite small , as you can show for yourself .
Increasing and continuous functions A function h( t ) is continuous if there are no gaps or jumps in the graph of its values , in other words if you can draw the graph without taking your pen off the paper ( this is n't the formal definition , but it 's the essence of it ; see this Mathworld entry for a formal definition ) .
A function is increasing if whenever t2>t1 then h ( t2 ) > h ( t1 ) .
For example , the function h 1 ( t ) =t is both continuous and increasing for all values of t , h 2 ( t ) = t2 is continuous for all values of t but only increasing for positive values of t , and h 3 ( t ) =tan ( t ) =sin(t ) / cos(t ) has a discontinuity whenever cos(t ) = 0 .
The graphs of h 1 , h 2 and h 3 in red , green and yellow respectively .
To start with , we will assume that both states possess identical missiles which are equally unprotected .
Remember that each state feels " safe " if enough of their ICSMs survive a sneak attack by the other state , so that they can inflict heavy damage on the attacker .
If SSA has x weapons then for SSB to feel safe it has to have at least some minimum number g of weapons .
This number g depends on x , so we will write it as g(x ) .
As the number x gets bigger , the number g(x ) also increases .
In maths speak we say that g(x ) is an increasing function of x .
We also assume that g(x ) is continuous , in other words that there are no jumps or gaps in its graph .
( See the box on the right for more about increasing and continuous functions . )
Now SSB feels safe if its own number of weapons , y , is greater than g( x ) , i.e. if y> g(x ) .
In the same way , SSA feels safe if x>f(y ) for some increasing and continuous function f(y ) .
Formulated as a complete mathematical statement , what we have is :
" There must exist two continuous , increasing functions f and g such that SSA feels safe if and only if x>f (y ) and SSB feels safe if and only if y > g( x ) . "
The if and only if in this statements simply means that the implication works both ways : if SSA feels safe then we know immediately that x>f( y ) , and , conversely , if x>f ( y ) , we know immediately that SSA feels safe .
SSA feels safe precisely when x>f(y ) , and the corresponding statement is true for SSB .
This is an important point because not every statement involving an implication is reversible like this : just think of the true sentence if an animal is a dog , then it is a mammal .
In this case the reverse , if an animal is a mammal , then it is a dog , is false .
The functions f and g are plotted in figure 1 below .
To see what these graphs tell us , first think about the curve g(x ) .
If a point ( x p , y p ) lies above this curve , then y p > g( x p ) .
So the point represents a situation in which SSB feels safe .
Similarly , you can convince yourself that any point to the right of f(y ) represents a situation in which SSA feels safe .
The intersection of the region above g(x ) and to the right of f(y ) ( the shaded region ) represents all situations acceptable to slugs in both states , so the number of ICSMs need not increase .
It 's a stable region .
But is there always an intersection ?
What if the two curves do n't meet at all ?
Figure 1 : For every point ( x p , y p ) in the shaded region , x p > f(y p ) and y p > g( x p ) .
So the shaded region represents all the situations where slugs in both states feel safe .
Slugs hanging in balance
Well , it turns out that this cannot happen .
The main reason for this is that the graphs of the functions f(y ) and g(x ) each have to have a very particular shape , and this can be proved mathematically .
To begin with , let 's look at the starting point of each graph .
SSA wants to destroy as much of SSB as possible , and the slugs of SSA can work out the number of ICSMs , x 0 , required to do so .
If SSB has no missiles at all , then SSA only needs x 0 missiles .
The same is true for SSB : there is a number of missiles , y 0 , that SSB feels it needs to destroy " enough " of SSA .
The two points ( x 0 ,0 ) and ( 0 ,y 0 ) represent the start of the curves x=f (y ) and y=g(x ) , respectively .
A little thought shows that there are only three types of continuous increasing curves , which are drawn in figure 2 .
The green curve gets steeper and steeper as y increases , and so we can call it an acceleratingly increasing curve ( this is n't the formal term ) .
The steepness of the blue curve , on the other hand , decreases so we can call it a deceleratingly increasing curve .
The straight red line has constant slope : it increases steadily .
Of course , the lines could accelerate or decelerate their steepness at different rates , or the straight line be more steep or less so , but there are only these three basic types of continuous increasing curves to consider .
You can convince yourself that if f(y ) is acceleratingly increasing and g(x ) is deceleratingly increasing then the two curves definitely meet , and a stable region exists .
In fact , the two curves meet in exactly one point which we have labelled ( x m , y m ) in figure 1 , and which is called the minimum stable point .
So proving that there is a stable region in which neither state needs to increase its arsenal now reduces to proving that each of f(y ) and g(x ) has the required shape .
And this can be done using some reasonably basic mathematical techniques .
We have included the proof for those who are interested .
Amazingly , a bit of maths can show that there 's still hope for slug world !
Figure 2 : The green acceleratingly increasing curve gets steeper as y increases ,
while the steepness of the blue deceleratingly increasing curve decreases .
Defence tactics
We will now go on to look at how the graph is changed by the introduction of various forms of defence , but in each case the two curves are of the same shapes as drawn in figure 1 , and so there will be just one minimum stable point .
We 'll ask how the position of this unique point is influenced by the defence tactics of each state .
First we ask what happens should SSA defend its missiles with CandyFloss or Spoonsful of Sugar .
If each missile is better protected , then the probability of any particular missile belonging to SSA suriving an attack is increased .
The probability of a missile surviving an attack can be built into the mathematical analysis of the problem .
In fact , it appears in the proof that f(y ) is acceleratingly increasing and g(x ) deceleratingly increasing .
If you 've read that proof , you can quite easily see that raising this probability means that the curve f(y ) moves to the left with the point ( x 0 ,0 ) fixed ( here is a more detailed explanation ) .
We 've drawn the old situation in black in figure 3 , and this new curve in red .
The good news from this graph is that the minimum stable point has moved to the left and down : both states need fewer ICSMs for stability .
Protecting your missiles is a good thing for all concerned .
Figure 3 : If SSA protects its missiles , then f(y ) ( the red curve )
moves to the left and g( x ) ( the blue curve ) moves up .
Now we suppose that SSA protects its cities and their sluggy denizens by means of SoSs , CandyFloss , or some yet - to - be- invented piece of slugtech .
Then SSB needs to launch more ICSMs in a sneak attack in order to inflict unacceptable damage on SSA .
This means that the entire curve g(x ) moves upwards as is shown by the blue curve in figure 3 .
Look at the new minimum stable point : now both states require more missiles for stability .
Bad news for the Campaign for Salty Disarmament .
We can also ask what happens if the missiles are converted to MPSMs ( Multiple Pinches of Salt in each Missile ) .
The implications of this change are a bit more complicated to trace , so take a deep breath and sharpen your pencil .
If SSA fits its missiles with multiple pinches of salt , then fewer of them need survive SSB 's sneak attack .
In fact , if N pinches of salt are fitted in each missile , then only about x 0 /N missiles need survive .
This moves the entire curve x=f(y ) to the left , as we show in blue in figure 4 .
But if SSB simply launches the same number of single - pinch missiles at SSA , then it is suddenly faced with N times as many pinches of salt surviving its sneak attack .
This is like relabelling the tick marks on the x-axis with numbers increased by a factor of N ; in other words , the x-axis gets compressed by a factor of N .
If you give some thought to what this relabelling means , you 'll see that if we want to plot the new curve y=g(x ) on the axes we already have , the curve will simply look much steeper and compressed .
This is also shown in blue in figure 4 .
The conclusion is that SSB now requires more ICSMs , and SSA requires fewer .
Perhaps this is a good way for SSA to bankrupt SSB and win the war without a grain of salt being spilled .
However , the detailed shape of the curves could change this conclusion , and it is here that our graphical analysis begins to lose its power .
Figure 4 : The blue curves show the affect of SSA fitting its missiles with multiple pinches of salt .
If SSB also introduces MPSMs then the situation muddies even further .
Because the axes of our graphs measure the number of missiles , both countries introducing MPSMs moves ( x 0 ,0 ) and ( 0 ,y 0 ) towards the origin .
This tends to decrease the minimum stable point .
However , a contrasting effect is that — in the way we have just described — f(y ) becomes more horizontal and g(x ) becomes more vertical , thus tending to increase ( x m , y m ) .
Exactly how these two effects interact and change the position of the minimum stable point is beyond the methods we have talked about here , but rest assured that the finest slug minds in the world have pondered the implications .
Postscript : Many slugs and other intelligent life forms have questioned a lot of the assumptions we have used above .
You may like to think of such questions for yourself , and wonder what would happen if , for example , the missiles of SSA had shorter range than those of SSB .
There are many questions you could think of : slugs of the world will unite to thank you .
In a future article , we will use graphical methods to explore the societal and ecological changes which could follow a major salty conflict .
Author 's note :
The tone of this article is light - hearted , but the issues in it were obviously inspired by the very real Cold War between the two blocs formed by the USSR on the one hand and the USA and Western Europe on the other .
Both blocs possessed nuclear weapons of terrible power , and were quite ready to consider global warfare scenarios in which perhaps billions of human lives were lost and the planet 's ecosystem rendered incapable of supporting life in the way we know it for centuries , if not longer .
A series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ( an ironic acronym in the context of this article ) have reduced these nuclear arsenals but despite the end of the Cold War , two striking facts remain : there are tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in several states around the world , and the only country ever to have been attacked by nuclear weapons , Japan , is the world 's most determined advocate of disarmament .

With her sparkling green eyes and mischievous smile , the oxygen and feeding tube Erin Cottington wears constantly is the only outward clue of her uphill struggle for survival .
But the key to the 20 - month - old 's battle to beat the health problems she has suffered since she was born is rather unusual - regular doses of the sex drug Viagra .
Video ... the tiny baby who survived against all the odds

• Born at less than 22 weeks - and baby Amillia survived
The toddler was first given the treatment when she was just a few days old to help her overcome life - threatening circulatory problems , caused by her underdeveloped heart and lungs .
Now she has one of the small blue pills each day to help keep her blood pressure down and stay healthy .
Scroll down for more ...
Although this may surprise those who know it as a cure for impotence , Viagra was originally developed to improve blood flow to the heart in angina sufferers .
Last night Erin 's mother , Alison , 33 , said : " We can laugh about it now and find it amusing that Erin is being treated with Viagra , but it has helped save her life .
" At the time she was so terribly poorly , the doctors thought we could lose her at any time , but she has fought it all .
" The drug has been vital for helping swell her arteries and keep her blood pressure down .
She has a bit more than one pill a day , crushed up in water , but the doctors think that as she grows the dosage will get smaller and she could eventually grow out of it .
" We are just thankful to have her with us , her will to live has stunned everyone . "
Doctors at St Mary 's Hospital , Manchester , first realised Erin was not developing properly in the womb when married Mrs Cottington went for her 20 week scan .
But it was n't until she was born , one week premature , weighing just 5 lb 13oz , in June 2005 , that they were able to assess exactly what was wrong .
They diagnosed a diaphragmatic hernia - a rare condition which affects around 4,000 babies each year that is caused by a hole in the diaphragm .
In Erin 's case , she had virtually no diaphragm on the right - handside of her body which meant that her intestines and bowels had pushed into her chest cavity as she was growing in the womb , crushing her right lung and heart and stopping them from developing properly .
Immediately after she was born doctors rushed Erin to intensive care and put her on a life - support machine .
But they knew that without specialist treatment that she would n't make it through the night , so they decided to fly Erin by air ambulance to Yorkhill Hospital , Glasgow .
There , medics placed Erin on a heart and lung bypass machine to pump oxygen into her blood and help her breathe .
They also pumped artificial blood into her crushed right lung to help it increase its capacity .
Erin was given Viagra to open up her blood vessels and improve the blood flow around her body .
She also had eight operations , including three to repair her diaphragm and open heart surgery to stem bleeding between her heart and lungs , before she was three months old .
" The doctors basically told us that if Erin stayed in Manchester she would not make it , " Mrs Cottington , a full - time mother , from Blackley , Manchester , said .
" It was awful , they prepared us for the worst because they did n't think she would make the transfer in the helicopter , let alone cope with the treatment .
But she kept battling and we were thrilled when they said she could come home . "
After more than 10 months in hospital , Erin was finally allowed out of hospital in April last year and is now on the road to recovery .
She is still fed through a tube and requires oxygen at night , but doctors are pleased with her progress and say she is developing like any other normal child .
Dr Carl Davies , a consultant paediatric surgeon at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow , who treats around six children a year with similar conditions , said : " Erin was very sick when she arrived with us - she was the most intensively - treated child in the world at that time .
" We have been using Viagra for a very small number of children for a few years and believe it can be very useful for a few patients .
She will be tested to see its impact and will grow out of it .
Most children stop taking it by the time they are two or three . "
Last week , doctors in Newcastle revealed they had also used Viagra to help a premature baby boy to breathe .
Lewis Goodfellow , who was born 16 weeks premature , was given the drug to help open tiny blood vessels in his seriously underdeveloped lungs .
Tech CVs : the lies !

There ’s nothing more likely to get you thrown out of a job interview than it becoming obvious that you ’ve lied on your CV , coming a close second is coming across as completely incompetent in your area of expertise .
So you would hope that it would be common knowledge not to put things down on your CV which you do n’t know about .
I ca n’t imagine taxi firms get applicants who think having sat in a car qualifies them at drivers , or people claiming to be French translators due to having slept through 5 years of french lessons at school .
Yet IT seems somehow different … there seems to be an obsession with having magic words on yor CV .
As if having “ J2EE ” or “ XML ” will turn you from a Clark Kent candidate into a Superman candidate .
Sure having those keywords may get you that interview , but once they find out you ’ve lied there ’s a good chance you ’ll get blacklisted from that company forever .
And if you ’re applying through a recruiter say good - bye to all those juicy high - paying jobs sitting on her desk .
One of the most important part of a recruitment consultant ’s job is maintaining a good relationship with her clients ( the companies , not you , who do you think pays her ? ) – and if you ’re pissing her clients off she ’s not going to risk letting you interview with her best clients .
For some reason the worst offenders seem to be the newly graduated , i’ve had graduates claiming C experience not knowing what “ printf ” is , I ’ve had graduates with 3 years Java experience not knowing what a JVM is .
And to take the mick I ’ve had a candidate who put Python on their CV who when asked about it answered “ Oh I do n’t know Python – but I was planning to learn it when I wrote my CV ” .
I ’ve come to the conclusion that one of the main problems is that candidates especially junior ones might think that they know more than they do , simply because it ’s hard to tell how much you do n’t know unless you ’ve been in an enviroment surrounded with people who know a lot more than you .
So to help solve the problem I ’ve come up with a list of common tech skills and languages people put on their CV along with the minimum level of knowledge I ’d expect to associate with it :
Programming in general Understand the different types of programming languages and their advantages and disadvantages .
Understand variables , function calls and recursion .
Understand the difference between assignment by reference and value and passing by reference and value .
And how this applies to your favourite language .
Object - Orientation Understand the key concepts of OO – especially encapsulation , inheritence , polymorphism .
Know the advantages / disadvantages of inheritence versus composition .
Design Patterns
Know the easier design patterns iterators , singletons , etc .
Have knowledge of the gang of four book .
C Know standard I/O , know how to read parameters from the command line Understand pointers Understand dynamic memory allocation Understand the scope of variables Understand the difference between preprocessor , compiler and linker
C++
All of the C stuff Understand the virtual keyword Know what parts of a class a compiler will provide by default and what the default ones do .
Know what a constructor / destructor are and when they ’re called .
Java Know what the JVM is and what it does Understand roughly how garbage collection works
Python Understand the importance of indenting
Why some numbers are immutable Tuples , sets , dictionaries , etc .
XML
The advantages / disadvantages of using XML ( say versus a fixed - length encoding system )
The advantages / disadvantages of the SAX and DOM models
How to parse XML using your favourite languages / libraries Know what XSLT is
Unix Know how to use the console for day - to - day file handling Understand piping and redirection of inputs / outputs
I think that ’s enough brain - dumping for now ….
but I ’m sure I ’ll be back to add some more later on .
So if any of those had you thinking “ do I really know the stuff on my CV ” perhaps it ’s time to brush - up your word processing skills … .
NEAR SHIMA HOSPITAL The Hiroshima Panorama Project , Photography of October , 1945
Out of print since 1975 , through special arrangement with the original publisher in Japan , we have made available again the three photo - panoramas of the destroyed city of Hiroshima .
This is a not - for - profit project created for education about the effects of nuclear war .
The project has no official connection with the city of Hiroshima , nor with Shima Hospital there , but we believe both would support this effort .
Our project name is taken from the title given to one of the panoramas in 1973 .
All panoramas are on heavy chart paper and folded , each about 8 feet long .
1. NEAR SHIMA HOSPITAL ( Ground level from the hypocenter ) by U.S. Research Group .
Almost 360 degrees , Paper : 13.75 " X 91.5 " ; Photo : 10.25 " X 89.25 "
2. FROM THE ( roof top ) FORMER CHUGOKU SHIMBUN BLDG . by Shigeo Hayashi ; 360 degrees , Paper : 13.75 " X 106.6 " ; Photo : 10.25 " X 104.5 "
3. FROM THE ( roof top ) HIROSHIMA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BLDG . by Shigeo Hayashi ; 360 degrees , Paper : 13.75 " X 106.5 " ; Photo : 8.1 " X 102.4 "
The panoramas show the physical effects of a small ( 15 kiloton * ) nuclear weapon on a city of 400,000 .
Japanese and English text in the photo border indicates significant landmarks .
This is a remarkable photo - record of an extraordinary historical event .
Displayed , they should provoke serious thought from students and adults .
The photo on this page ( greatly reduced in size ) is a small section of panorama 3 .
It shows the " T - Bridge " ( Aioi Bridge ) , which was the aiming point , and in the distance beyond , the Honkawa and Kodo Elementary Schools .
All three of the charts photographically sweep over the entire 360 degree panorama of the destroyed city .
They are a devastating comment on the effects of a small nuclear weapon .

From here ( paid as usual ) :
Time Warner Inc. ’s AOL and Google Inc. have entered exclusive negotiations over a deal that would have the search giant pay $ 1 billion for a 5 % stake in AOL , deepening their advertising partnership , according to a person close to the situation .
The talks shut out Microsoft Corp. , which has been wooing AOL since January .
As part of the deal , AOL would be able to sell advertising among the search results provided by Google on AOL Web properties .
AOL ’s sales staff would also sell display ads across Google ’s network of Web publishers .
Fascinating : AOL selling display inventory across Google ’s network – in other words , AdSense . Hmmm. Hmmm . Hmmm …… … Now does Google have the right to let AOL sell my pages , if I am an AdSense publisher ?
Hmmmm .
I guess I ’d be OK with that if AOL reps know who I am , and what ads are endemic , and why my site works , and all that .
But …. will they ?
Or is this a land grab of sorts ?
Is this Google buying its way into having a real sales force ?
Interesting .

02:31 pm - The Fourteen Precepts of Engaged Buddhism
By Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh from the book ' Interbeing '
" 1 . Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine , theory , or ideology , even Buddhist ones .
Buddhist systems of thought are guiding means ; they are not absolute truth .
2 . Do not think the knowledge you presently possess is changeless , absolute truth .
Avoid being narrow minded and bound to present views .
Learn and practice nonattachment from views in order to be open to receive others ' viewpoints .
Truth is found in life and not merely in conceptual knowledge .
Be ready to learn throughout your entire life and to observe reality in yourself and in the world at all times .
3 . Do not force others , including children , by any means whatsoever , to adopt your views , whether by authority , threat , money , propaganda , or even education .
However , through compassionate dialogue , help others renounce fanaticism and narrow - mindedness .
4 . Do not avoid suffering or close your eyes before suffering .
Do not lose awareness of the existence of suffering in the life of the world .
Find ways to be with those who are suffering , including personal contact , visits , images and sounds .
By such means , awaken yourself and others to the reality of suffering in the world .
5 . Do not accumulate wealth while millions are hungry .
Do not take as the aim of your life fame , profit , wealth , or sensual pleasure .
Live simply and share time , energy , and material resources with those who are in need .
6 . Do not maintain anger or hatred .
Learn to penetrate and transform them when they are still seeds in your consciousness .
As soon as they arise , turn your attention to your breath in order to see and understand the nature of your hatred .
7 . Do not lose yourself in dispersion and in your surroundings .
Practice mindful breathing to come back to what is happening in the present moment .
Be in touch with what is wondrous , refreshing , and healing both inside and around you .
Plant seeds of joy , peace , and understanding in yourself in order to facilitate the work of transformation in the depths of your consciousness .
8 . Do not utter words that can create discord and cause the community to break .
Make every effort to reconcile and resolve all conflicts , however small .
9 . Do not say untruthful things for the sake of personal interest or to impress people .
Do not utter words that cause division and hatred .
Do not spread news that you do not know to be certain .
Do not criticize or condemn things of which you are not sure .
Always speak truthfully and constructively .
Have the courage to speak out about situations of injustice , even when doing so may threaten your own safety .
10 .
Do not use the Buddhist community for personal gain or profit , or transform your community into a political party .
A religious community , however , should take a clear stand against oppression and injustice and should strive to change the situation without engaging in partisan conflicts .
11 . Do not live with a vocation that is harmful to humans and nature .
Do not invest in companies that deprive others of their chance to live .
Select a vocation that helps realise your ideal of compassion .
12 . Do not kill .
Do not let others kill .
Find whatever means possible to protect life and prevent war .
13 . Possess nothing that should belong to others .
Respect the property of others , but prevent others from profiting from human suffering or the suffering of other species on Earth .
14 . Do not mistreat your body .
Learn to handle it with respect .
Do not look on your body as only an instrument .
Preserve vital energies ( sexual , breath , spirit ) for the realisation of the Way .
( For brothers and sisters who are not monks and nuns : )
Sexual expression should not take place without love and commitment .
In sexual relations , be aware of future suffering that may be caused .
To preserve the happiness of others , respect the rights and commitments of others .
Be fully aware of the responsibility of bringing new lives into the world .
Meditate on the world into which you are bringing new beings . "
From the book ' Interbeing ' : Fourteen Guidelines for Engaged Buddhism , revised edition : Oct. l993 by Thich Nhat Hanh , published by Parallax Press , Berkeley , California
" Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh is a Buddhist monk , poet , peace activist , and the author of Being Peace , The Miracle of Mindfulness , and many other books .
He lives in a monastic community in south - western France called Plum Village , where he teaches , writes , gardens , and works to help refugees world - wide .
He conducts retreats throughout the world on the art of mindful living , and has conducted special retreats for American Vietnam War veterans , psychotherapists , artists , environmental activists and children . "

I was raised an aethiest so am not very familiar with Christianity , but always felt what I knew of Jesus was that he was an acitivist steeped in compassion .

Does n't 3 , which I sort of like on first look , seem to contradict 10 , which scares me a little at first glance , and even seems to invite contradiction within itself ?
This sect of Zen still confuses me .
Reply ) ( Thread From : mindfulness Date : August 11th , 2004 09:58 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Compassionate dialogue and forced education seem quite different to me , but of course execution would require finesse .
Is this what seems contradictory ?
I am not sure how " take a clear stand " could contradict " force " ing others " to adopt your views " .
Also , what scares you about 10 ?
I am feeling very mentally blind today and do n't want to assume that I know what you mean .

I 'm not really sure ... I 've just found engaged Buddhism , if I understand the basic idea , not to be my thing , I guess .
I think it invites distractions which would terminally yank me out of actual practice .
Some people who like Thich Naht Hanh have seemed to me to be the same people who would venerate self - immolating monks , and this seems clearly off the tracks to me .
What it boils down to , I guess , is that I just want a Buddhism that focuses on zazen and guides practice to grow in the proper direction , keeps the refuge open , and trusts in the people it changes .
Anything beyond that just worries me , period . :)
I posted some of Juan Mascaro 's translation a while back , was that you ?
No worries , I just figured you did n't have anything to say . :)

I 'm gonna take a run at this again , because I 'm still thinking about it .
In order for the religious community to take a stand against anyone , the religious community must have a consensus , whether it's an actual consensus or one supplied from an authority , and in either case , members of the community ... or , more important to my mind , potential members of the community ... must conform , and be persuaded quite firmly to join the consensus in order for the religious community to take a stand against whatever it is they 're standing against , right or wrong .
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : mindfulness Date : August 12th , 2004 10:16 pm ( UTC ) ( Link )
Yes , I was discussing the differing translations with you .
I 've got some thoughts on the topic , but my difficulty with social interaction sometimes means I am neglectful .
I 'd like to get back to it .
As for the distractions of engaged Buddhism , I can see how that would be an issue , and I know social concerns have at times distracted me from mindfulness and growth .
I do find the idea of self immolation quite a distraction from mindfulness and growth .
As for community action and consensus - your concerns are true .
I 've seen very odd forms of ' consensus ' in action at times .
As for an ideal situation I 'd like to think that each time an issue arose different members of a community could come together on that issue if it concerned them , or not if it did n't .
I find the idea of anyone being forced to conform disturbing .
Diversity is strength to me as it implies flexibility in a chaotic world .
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : mai_neh Date : August 12th , 2004 08:20 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I do n't get any aspect of Zen that revolves around lists of forbidden fruit .
Nearly all of these 14 points start with " Do Not " .
They are like a list of Buddhist Commandments , handed down to the feeble faithful who know not how to think for themselves .
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : beginnermind Date : August 12th , 2004 03:44 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) I do n't mind some precepts ... whether it 's ten or five , they usually seem to make a kind of sense .
They should relate directly to the eightfold path , though , and help illuminate it around commonly wondered - about issues .
They 're like ... " Hmm ... right view ... what the hell does that mean ?
Let 's watch the Bodhisattva and see what she does in her natural environment .
Crikey , there 's your right action right there , see !
She 's not boffing that very buff but very confused disciple who wants to be her willing sex slave !
I guess that 'd be taking advantage , a misuse of sexuality somehow .
So , none of that , let 's write that down !
Let 's see what she does next ... "
Probably relates better to right action , but whatever , let 's not get dualistic now .* grin*
So , not commandments , just general cases that sound like good case studies of how to follow the eightfold path : " Things a Bodhisattva Wo n't Generally Do for 1000 , Alex . "
An interesting thing about the precepts , I find , is that part of keeping them is always also expressed as knowing when to break them .
I think they should be precepts you take upon yourself , though , not , like these , ones that encourage you to push action or inaction upon others , willing or not .
When I formally take any precepts , if I ever do , I do n't think I 'll be taking THESE precepts , though .
However popular they are , I just do n't like 'em .

Thanks for writing this - you put it better than I could , despite our different approach to these precepts .

Are you implying anyone who follows precepts are feeble ?
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : mai_neh Date : August 13th , 2004 02:51 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Yup .
That does n't mean they are feeble , but that 's an accurate interpretation of my text .
Negative precepts are another form of materialism , building sand castles out of words and defending them from the waves of reality .
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : mindfulness Date : August 13th , 2004 09:14 am ( UTC ) ( Link )
Now if they were reworded to be affirmative rather than negative , and this is possible , would you still be opposed to them on the same grounds ?
I could imagine so .
They would sound like ' should ' statements .
Also , although this is perhaps poor logic , " Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine , theory , or ideology , even Buddhist ones ... "
I think gives us both a lot of slack here .
And then there 's that whole ' finger pointing at the moon " metaphor .
Nonetheless , I did like your sandcastle metaphor .
I did n't post these precepts because I held them strongly , while they do reflect my ideals somewhat , but rather wanted to share them and explore the issues they raised with people .
I am interested in the realm between idealism and pragmatism .
Thanks for your words .
They 've made me aware of the attachment I feel .
( BTW I like your icon .
It 's very happy . )

Ah , yes , when Buddhists use the " should " word I shudder ;-)
For what its worth , I did read the precepts you posted , so they did spark some reflection , despite my negative reaction to their form .
I learn just as much from those with whom I disagree , as from those with whom I agree .
Maybe I even learn more from disagreement , because I try to take the other side 's point of view seriously .

Do not kill .
Do not let others kill .
Find whatever means possible to protect life and prevent war .
I find this one especially interesting .
I do n't think I would ever kill anyone .
I move bugs outside rather than kill them .
But how can you protect life and stop others from killing without entering some type of conflict with them .
Words may act too slowly and actions may merely breed further aversion in the minds of those you seek to stop .
I wonder where the happy medium may be .
If there is one .
Do you have any thoughts ?

Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : oboegoddess Date : August 12th , 2004 08:46 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I also liked these a lot .
The only one I strongly disagree with is number 14 .
I personally do n't see anything wrong with sexuality outside of " love and commitment " , at least the kind of love and commitment that it seemed to me was implied by that statement .
I feel that as long as you love yourself enough to take care of your body , and everyone involved consents to the sexual acts , there is nothing wrong with " casual " sex .
Reply ) ( Thread From : bhagwan Date : August 12th , 2004 11:17 am ( UTC ) ( Link )
We 're so used to sexual judgement in our culture , that I think its easy to overreact to prudish - sounding monks .
I think its a fair observation that the expression of sexuality can be dangerous -- not in the sense that it will cause harm , but in the sense that when things go wrong , the potential for harm is very great .
The degree of power in sexuality demands a proportionate degree of mindfullness .
Crude analogy : a " Russian Roulette " pistol causes no harm 5 times out of 6 .

I do remember one monk saying that even consensual acts can be damaging to the mind .
A person who has been abused for example , may love their abuser and seek to continue abusive relationships .
I know there are a lot more cogent arguments supporting the precept but I do n't feel up to presenting them .

In your new film , it 's obvious that you really like Iran .
You even describe it as Wonderland .
Is n't that pushing it ?
No , it was like tumbling down the rabbit hole , discovering Iran for the first time .
I think it is remarkable that here is an Islamic society ruled by a theocracy where drug addiction is openly discussed , there 's rehab , there 's HIV education .
You would n't find that in most pro-western " democratic " Arab regimes .
Here is an Islamic country that is being prodded and poked and held up to scrutiny by its own people .
What about the more troublesome parts of Iranian society ?
Yes , there is oppression , people being stoned and hanged and all that .
None of that is in the film .
No , because there surely is an argument and a need to present the other side of Iranian society , where changes are being made .
What do you think would happen if there was an attack on Iran ?
It would be the best thing for the most conservative forces within the clergy .
The Islamic revolution is 27 years old .
It is trying to make itself relevant for this generation , but is running out of steam .
An attack on Iran would destroy all the young voices .
Who is going to applaud an attack on their country ?
It would be a shot in the arm for the hardliners and that 's why you will find people like Shirin Ebadi , the Nobel peace laureate , and Akbar Ganji , the political prisoner , going around Washington urging anyone who will listen to prevent an attack .
Do you have regrets about your coverage of Iraq ?
Absolutely .
We ran around , we did pieces on weapons inspectors , Saddam , the regime , and almost nothing about Iraqi people .
Now everyone is saying , " How relevant is sectarianism in Iraq ? " , and if we had described the people more , what their fears were , maybe we'd have a few more ideas .
But we should n't make that mistake again and think the Iranian people are desperate to have a bombing campaign so the regime will fall , because it 's not as simple as that .
How 's it going at Al - Jazeera ?
Very well .
It 's a very professional product .
Now comes the test of showing how alternative a voice it is going to be - is it another mainstream channel , or is it really going to break the monopoly of western presentation ?
Do you miss the blanket coverage that you were getting ?
Me personally ?
No .
You were one of the highest - profile Muslims at the BBC .
Could n't you have had more influence by staying there ?
I do n't think so .
Many people from many backgrounds at the BBC have tried .
Why did you leave ?
I wanted to be an independent journalist who did projects for the people I wanted .
I wanted to be free .
You called the BBC a white man 's club .
Is that still the case ?
I suppose .
It 's the mentality .
I 'm in some ways guilty of this - I went to public school , I went to Oxford .
I speak at a lot of schools with Somali kids and they say , " How do I become a journalist ?
We may be from the same community , but I do n't have your accent . "
So it 's a class thing rather than about being white necessarily .
It 's much more subtle .
Are n't you preaching to the choir at Al - Jazeera ?
No , Al - Jazeera is absolutely there for a western audience .
Its ambition is not to be the in - house channel for Muslims - it wants to be watched and listened to in Downing Street and the White House .
I 'm trying to reverse the information flow .
Are people suspicious of you for having gone there ?
Definitely , and it still evokes , " No I do n't want to be interviewed on Al - Jazeera " , even in this country .
How do you feel about the " Scud Stud " business ?
People have asked , " If you were not black and if you did n't look the way you do , do you think anyone would have demeaned you in that way ? "
And there is an element of that .
The interesting thing is that the public hardly ever comes out with it now .
It 's only ever really used in the media .
Does it bother you ?
At times it does , but they could be saying much worse things .
At first I thought , it 's good way to burst one 's balloon - do n't take yourself too seriously .
But any time my name appears in any newspaper , it will be there : " Rageh Omaar , the BBC 's former Scud Stud in Iraq . "
That 's it - it 's red fleece , standing on a rooftop .
But you are wearing a red fleece .
Only to protect myself from my children 's snot .
And it 's kind of more burgundy this time .

Climbing out of Technical Debt © 2002 Johanna Rothman , www.jrothman.com
Have you ever had a conversation like this one ?
Vice President :
In the last release , you were able to bring the release date by over a month by cutting the testing .
Do that again , ok ?
Project Manager : Sorry , boss , we cant do that .
For the past three releases weve shortchanged the design work and the testing .
We cant cut any time from this project .
In fact , it s time to re-architect the system , redesign it , and do the testing weve put off .
Vice President : NO WAY !
Project Manager :
Hey , that s just the way it is .
We havent taken the time to finish this product yet , and our shortcuts have come home to roost .
Our technical debt is too high to work this release the way weve worked the others .
Technical debt , as defined by my colleague Dave Smith , is the debt a company owes to a product they persisted in shipping in an incomplete or unstable condition .
This is a situation referred to in Hunt and Thomass book The Pragmatic Programmer as software rot or by Gerald M. Weinberg in Quality Software Management , Volume 4 as design maintenance debt .
The software isnt necessarily rotten the product is incomplete .
As the technical debt increases , the load on the customer support staff becomes overwhelming , and the developers have trouble adding or changing system features .
When developers are stuck on new development and support is overloaded , you face difficult choices about what to do now : have developers support the current product ; ignore the current product and continue with development ; some combination of support and development ; or stop developing and fix what youve already got .
Project managers , development managers and test managers often can see this coming .
They know there is a window of opportunity to fix the product before the technical debt overwhelms the companys ability to do new product development .
Look for these signs of technical debt :
You ship a product and then have to put out a point release before its even left the CD duplication house .
Testing time increases disproportionately to the development time .
The developers tell you that part of the product needs to be re-architected , because the current architecture doesnt support the current requirements , never mind the additional requirements .
Developers refuse to touch a part of the product saying ,  No one but Fred can touch that .
I know Fred left three years ago , but no one else can work on it , because we dont understand it . 
Developers spend more time supporting current customers by solving customer problems , fixing defects , and answering customer questions , than they spend developing new product .
You hire more testers than you have developers , and you re still not sure youve tested the product .
Your developers threaten to leave because all they do is maintenance .
You ship the product not because its ready , but because the developers  families have abducted them to go on vacation , or the developers are too exhausted to continue the crunch mode youve been in .
You stop testing because you do n't want to find more defects .
Your cost to fix a defect continues to increase , from release to release .
( If youd like to see a picture of this dynamic , check out Weinbergs Quality Software Management , Volume 4 , reference below .
Recognize your technical debt , and start planning what to do .
Before you can plan , you need to know a little about how you came to have this technical debt problem .
These questions may help you understand how your product acquired its technical debt :
How do you staff projects ?
Do you assign enough people at the time they are needed , or are some positions never assigned or assigned late to a project ?
If you never assign enough testers , or you dont have an architect , you will incur technical debt .
Dont blindly accept people starting on your projects late , because you cant make up time in a project .
Have people start when they re supposed to start , or recalculate the project schedule .
How do you design your projects ?
Do you first architect the entire product for its entire lifetime ?
Do you iterate on the design for several projects ?
If you dont architect the product , and update the architecture as necessary , or if you dont do a high level design before starting to code , you will not have a congruous product .
One way to recognize an incongruous product is when you have multiple ways of doing the same thing .
At one organization , the developers couldnt agree on how to open and save data files .
Since they couldnt agree , every time a developer wanted to open or save their data file , they had their own open and save functions .
When they moved from a command line interface ( CLI ) to a GUI interface , they had no easy way to integrate the open and save functionality .
How do you test the product ?
Do you have a way to start testing the product at the beginning of the project ?
Do you only have manual tests through the graphical user interface ?
If you start limited testing late , you re guaranteeing yourself technical debt .
You have many opportunities to test early and often : requirements inspections , design reviews , code inspection or peer review , unit tests , daily builds and smoke tests ( tests to verify the daily build works at least a little bit ) , peer review of fixes in addition to system test .
Decide what makes sense for your environment , and add test capability as early in the project as possible .
How do you organize your projects ?
Do you have functional managers who hand off the product from the analysts to the developers to the testers to the manufacturing folks ?
If so , no one has the same view of what the product should be .
At a minimum , assign an overall project manager or program manager , so someone is pulling the entire project together .
Projects without project managers are highly risky , and in my experience , always fail .
In addition , projects without a sponsor or champion have a difficult time finishing .
How do you know what done means ?
Do you have some objective criteria to know when the project is complete ?
If not , you re more likely to release an incomplete product .
Develop release criteria for every project , so that everyone on the project , and the project sponsor understands what your company will receive for its project money .
How do you run your projects ?
Do you stick to only one type of lifecycle and one process ?
You may need to choose other lifecycles and / or processes to avoid future technical debt .
Many project managers are comfortable with a particular lifecycle and / or process , and it can be difficult for those project managers to switch to a different lifecycle for a project .
If you re used to a waterfall lifecycle , youll have to learn to plan for an iterative or incremental lifecycle differently .
And , youll have to monitor your projects differently .
If you ve changed your lifecycle , you may need to change your process .
What you do and when you do it will make the lifecycle successful and keep down technical debt .
If you ve never planned when to do inspections and reviews , start with something small , such as peer review of defect fixes during system test .
Ive found that a nightly build and smoke test helps find defects faster , and helps everyone realize when the product is not ready to ship .
Although it feels as if you re moving faster when you take shortcuts on a project , in reality , your technical debt prevents you from making project progress .
You might be able to shortchange your product on one or two releases , but at some point your product technical debt is like credit card debt  if you dont pay it off in a planned way , the debt buries you .
Observe and measure your products , to know when you should act to reduce or avoid technical debt .

Mr Haw , 56 , from Worcestershire , said that he was taken to nearby Charing Cross police station and released shortly afterwards without charge .
It is the first time he has been arrested since a high court ruling in July , which established his right to continue his one - man protest .
New legislation introduced this summer requires protesters to obtain police permission before mounting a demonstration within a mile of parliament .
But the court ruled that the requirement does not apply to Mr Haw , as his protest began before the law came into force .
After returning to his spot on the pavement , surrounded by banners and flags in Parliament Square , Mr Haw told PA : " I 've been through this at great lengths with the police inspector and he accepts I 've got the right to be here and to have friends keeping me company .
" He said he would inform his officers , but the message obviously has n't filtered down to some of the constables on the beat .
" I was woken up at about 8 am by a couple of them shouting at a young woman who was minding my stuff while I slept .
They told her she was demonstrating and it was against the law , but she said she was just a friend of mine .
" I stuck my head out of my sleeping bag and said : ' Are you bothering this lady ? ' and , eventually , they arrested me for breach of the peace .
" I 'm not breaching the peace .
I 'm fighting for it . "
Scotland Yard had no immediate information on the incident .
Mr Haw began his lone vigil on June 2 2001 , initially in protest at international sanctions on Iraq and , later , at the war and its aftermath .
In the sci - fi movie " The Matrix , " a cable running from a computer into Neo 's brain writes in visual perceptions , and Neo 's brain can manipulate the computer - created world .
In reality , scientists cannot interact directly with the brain because they do not understand enough about how it codes and decodes information .
Now , neuroscientists in the McGovern Institute at MIT have been able to decipher a part of the code involved in recognizing visual objects .
Practically speaking , computer algorithms used in artificial vision systems might benefit from mimicking these newly uncovered codes .
The study , a collaboration between James DiCarlo's and Tomaso Poggio 's labs , appears in the Nov. 4 issue of Science .
" We want to know how the brain works to create intelligence , " said Poggio , the Eugene McDermott Professor in Brain Sciences and Human Behavior .
" Our ability to recognize objects in the visual world is among the most complex problems the brain must solve .
Computationally , it is much harder than reasoning . "
Yet we take it for granted because it appears to happen automatically and almost unconsciously .
" This work enhances our understanding of how the brain encodes visual information in a useful format for brain regions involved in action , planning and memory , " said DiCarlo , an assistant professor of neuroscience .
In a fraction of a second , visual input about an object runs from the retina through increasingly higher levels of the visual stream , continuously reformatting the information until it reaches the highest purely visual level , the inferotemporal ( IT ) cortex .
The IT cortex identifies and categorizes the object and sends that information to other brain regions .
To explore how the IT cortex formats that output , the researchers trained monkeys to recognize different objects grouped into categories , such as faces , toys and vehicles .
The images appeared in different sizes and positions in the visual field .
Recording the activity of hundreds of IT neurons produced a large database of IT neural patterns generated in response to each object under many different conditions .
Then , the researchers used a computer algorithm , called a classifier , to decipher the code .
The classifier was used to associate each object -- say , a monkey 's face -- with a particular pattern of neural signals , effectively decoding neural activity .
Remarkably , the classifier found that just a split second 's worth of the neural signal contained specific enough information to identity and categorize the object , even at positions and sizes the classifier had not previously " seen . "
It was quite surprising that so few IT neurons ( several hundred out of millions ) for such a short period of time contained so much precise information .
" If we could record a larger population of neurons simultaneously , we might find even more robust codes hidden in the neural patterns and extract even fuller information , " Poggio said .
This work was funded by DARPA , the Office of Naval Research and the National Institutes of Health .

You know what they say in the world of politics , right ?
Never let a good crisis go to waste .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 16 — A discussion of recent threats to judges ’ safety , at a bar association conference in suburban Dallas last week , became startlingly specific when Sandra Day O’Connor , the retired Supreme Court justice , recounted that each justice had received in the mail “ a wonderful package of home - baked cookies ” that contained “ enough poison to kill the entire membership of the court . ”
Justice O’Connor ’s remarks were reported on Thursday in The Star - Telegram in Fort Worth .
Although the episode was not publicly disclosed when it occurred in April 2005 , it had a public , although little - noticed , denouement last month when the sender of the poisoned cookies was sentenced in federal court here to 15 years in prison .

The sender , Barbara Joan March of Bridgeport , Conn. , pleaded guilty to 14 counts of “ mailing injurious articles . ”
The 14 recipients included the nine justices ; the chiefs of staff of the Army , Navy , and Air Force ; and the director and deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The packages , containing either candy or baked goods , were laced with rat poison .
In an interesting turn of events , a product that Apple has n't even announced is currently earning more attention in the press than Microsoft 's ultra-hyped , astroturfed , press - blitzed iPod Killer .
In fact , Apple 's still unannounced iPhone has rocketed the company 's market valuation to an all time high , meaning that Apple has made more from silence than Microsoft has earned in actual sales of its new player .
After Apple 's stock price surged to a new record high , it then retreated on further rumors that the iPhone might be delayed , only to again recover the next day .
With that kind of wild publicity power , its no wonder that Apple has been biting its tongue .
Unfortunately , Apple 's silence leaves the iPhone - curious stuck with the writings of pundits , many of whom are bitter that Apple has repeatedly proven them wrong in their prognostications of imminent Apple woe .
Kanellos Pulls a CNET
CNET 's Michael Kanellos decided to shamelessly open his Apple iPhone attack with a warning that his opinion was designed to " antagonize Apple fans . "
Maybe Kanellos should instead be trying to enlighten all his readers .
Kanellos is certainly not the only writer taking shots at rumored Apple products , but his article , like CNET colleague Charles Cooper 's earlier iPod Attack , is so consistently bad that it makes a great outline for describing what I like to call the CNET School of Bad Analysis .
Kanellos starts out by inventing a series of ideas to critique : an imagined gushing review of the iPhone , then a hypothetical Apple colostomy bag , then invented memories of historical products , supposedly from Apple , including a " random video camera " and previous cell phones .
Facts are optional at CNET , where writers can make up ideas and invent quotes to support their agenda .
Strike One : Facts Are Not In Your Favor
When Kanellos ventures into the world of facts , his arguments start to break down .
He attempts to write off the iSight and Airport wireless networking as " would - be hits , " apparently failing to grasp that Apple makes considerable money on both , and that that each is key to Apple 's ongoing product strategies .
While Apple has n't ever sold the " random video camera " or " cell phones " that Kanellos seems to recall , Apple has sold generations of Airport wireless and lots of iSights , pioneering both product categories with higher quality offerings that are significantly easier to use than competitors ' .
Apple also leads in consumer brand awareness in both areas .
Sales of the iSight , a high quality Firewire camera that is sold at a premium over the cheap , low quality webcams common on PCs , have only gone down recently after Apple built cameras into all its laptops and iMacs as standard equipment .
Anyone who thinks Apple 's Airport software is n't miles ahead of what 's available in Windows or from third parties simply has n't ever used it .
Airport plays a major role in Apple 's education sales , and is also tied into iTunes and contributes to the company 's iTV product strategy .
Airport and iSight are not would - be hits , but rather distinct home runs .
There are plenty of failures and missteps Apple has made in the past that can be criticized , but confusing reality of existing products with supposition and conjecture is n’t an honest or credible way to write news analysis .
If Kanellos is n't aware of today ’s reality , how is he qualified to talk about the outlook of future products ?
Strike Two : The First Rule of CNET : Do n't Talk About CNET
If Kanellos is looking for credibility of his CNET article , he needs to stop beating up the ridiculous claims made in earlier articles published on CNET .
His first was a January 2005 article that asked if the Mac mini would " spur a petite PC revolution . "
Of course it did in sorts , but Kanellos seems to prefer think Intel 's AOpen rip off showcase did n't happen , and that the Mac mini is n't selling for Apple .
Perhaps he needs a fact checker .
In any event , the idea he 's criticizing was originated by CNET .
Apple never claimed that PCs in general would suddenly become small and highly integrated .
PCs have been big empty boxes that have only gradually changed since 1982 .
He then quotes a CNET article from 2002 and suggests it as proof that some thought Apple would drive PC prices higher .
Except that the article did n't say that at all .
For further strangeness , Kanellos actually wrote that earlier article , so he should know what it said .
Criticizing your own writing as a source of ridiculous sensationalism does not help in making your point .
Strike Three : If You Can't Say Anything Interesting , Do n't Say Anything At All
After half an article on colostomy bag speculation and references to failed Apple cell phones and video recorders that did n't ever exist , little remained of his space to fill between all those ads .
This is where the actual smack on the iPhone begins , so let 's consider why his ideas are wrong .
Kanellos starts with the idea that Apple 's iPod success was a stroke of luck centered entirely on choosing the 1.8 " hard drive .
Based on that , he announces that the iPod " looks like it may turn out to be a non-repeatable experience . "
However , there has not been one iPod .
In the first three years there were three generations , then the iPod Mini , the Shuffle , and the Nano , and two more generations of iPod and then another new generation of each line .
So the iPod is n't a single shot like Microsoft 's would be killer , but a volley of ten different models , each of which blew away its competition .
In retrospect , its easy to say the iPod was a simple success .
That forgets that the original iPod only took over the hard drive player market .
Apple played a calculated risked in targeting the flash market with the Mini , then again targeted the low end remains with the Shuffle .
Each effort was a success , and continues to be .
Meanwhile , Apple not only faced the existing market leaders , including Creative , but also weathered an industry wide assault by Microsoft 's PlaysForSure , an initiative CNET writers did not exactly bet against .
In fact , CNET was slobbering all over PlaysForSure until Microsoft gave up on it and abandoned all its partners to take on the iPod solo , a move that prompted Peter Sealey , a professor at Berkeley 's Haas School of Business , to observe , “ I 've never seen a business so blatantly screw its business partners . ”
That 's also when CNET started describing how Microsoft 's new solo effort was going to take over the world and how the iPod was threatened with imminent crisis .
Apparently , CNET ’s analysis applies differently against Apple and Microsoft , and that difference flies in the face of actual facts .
To suggest that the iPod is a one hit wonder that magically lasted for five years is plainly absurd .
Strike Four : Ignore Real Problems , Invent False Ones ?
Kanellos does throw Apple a bone by observing that the iPod " conquered the problem of small screens and cheesy navigation , " but then continues , " unfortunately for Apple , problems like that do n't exist in the handset business . "
Quick , somebody find a cell phone and bring it to CNET .
Is there anyone who uses any cell phone who thinks its interface is elegant or even decently functional ?
Anyone who has supported real users knows that most phone functions go unused simply because they are too complex .
Todays phones are certainly thin and feature rich , but they suffer from the same problems as music players that predated the iPod : incoherent navigation and overloaded controls .
It 's a software problem , not a hardware one .
Kanellos says Samsung has " scoured the world 's design schools and hired artists on three continents to keep its phones looking good , " but he misses the point : technology is n't all about looking good , its about being functional .
In the same breath , Kanellos discounts Apple 's chances in developing a phone by saying " music players are fairly easy . "
But if Samsung is doing so well in design , why can't it bite off more than a tiny fraction of the music player market , which is , according to Kanellos , so brain dead simple ?
Even ignoring the fictitious Apple products Kanellos made up , there are plenty of products Apple designs and delivers that make it obvious that putting out a phone would not be a serious challenge for the company .
Heard of the video conferencing , wirelessly connected Mac Book ?
Seen the Nano ?
These are top sellers , competitively priced , with features unmatched by others .
Apple is not a company of robot thumbs that can't deliver products .
Phones quite obviously need help in user interface design ; Apple has no problem in developing technology .
Strike Five : The Lost Opportunity to Make An Intelligent Point
After blowing so much hot air in his efforts to be antagonistic , Kanellos ' most remarkable failure is in not completing the point he almost made .
He had an opportunity to compare Apple 's successes to Microsoft , but dropped it before any facts were involved .
Kanellos argued that Apple 's past success would not necessarily allow it to " break into other categories and turn them upside down . "
But Apple actually has managed to move from PCs to consumer electronics , with an array of iPods that have all been highly successful , as well as Airport , iSight and other significant products .
Tellingly , the writers of CNET style content use the opposite line to support Microsoft 's efforts outside of Windows .
They have hammered pro-Microsoft FUD into nearly every article they publish .
The bottom line : wait and buy Microsoft 's version ; it may be here any day now .
However , they 've been wrong for the last five years regarding Microsoft 's imminent take over of smartphones , music players , game consoles and tablet PCs , so why are they quick to turn around and beat Apple with Microsoft 's problems ?
Why did n't Kanellos backtrack on half a decade of FUD ?
Clearly it 's not in his interests as a writer for CNET .
Strike Six : A Reinvented Phrase to Ridicule
Writers of CNET style publications coined the phrase " iPod Halo , " to describe how satisfied iPod buyers might drive new sales of the Mac as well as create general brand awareness for Apple : elementary cross marketing .
The main reason the iPod Halo phrase was invented was so it could be brought up repeatedly to question its existence and legitimacy .
This is an effective way to instill fear , uncertainly , and doubt , because it isolates jingo - like phrases from reality .
It would appear stupid to say that iPod sales are n't helping Apple , but phrase it as a " theory , " and it can now be attacked and presented as a controversial idea , which more and more thoughtful Americans now question :
What 's your opinion on the Colored Sky Theory ?
Do you also question the Round Earth Theory like so many others ?
Do you think the Global Warming Theory is personally inconvenient ?
Kanellos brings up the iPod Halo , but refers to it a theory of his own naming : " iPod Magic , " as if he reinvented reality in a slightly less credible fashion that is easier to debunk .
You do n’t believe in magic , do you ?
He then cites his previous column , where he does n't question Apple 's Mac growth , but does quibble about how much the iPod contributed .
Kanellos also seems unable to grasp that Apple turned around from a near death experience in 2000 , just in time to suffer a devastating blow in 2001 by the collapse of the dotcom market .
One can't understand the present without understanding the past .
The Real Prospects of an iPhone
Despite Kanellos ' rambling efforts to discredit the iPhone before anything is really known about it , it is quite obvious that Apple 's core competencies offer a lot for the prospects of a mobile phone product .
It could also tie in well with Apple 's other products , including the iPod and the iTV , and naturally fit into Apple 's retail store efforts .
A followup article will describe how in more detail .

家族旅行をする際、0歳の赤ちゃんがいると場所や移動手段に悩んでしまうでしょう。いつ頃から旅行をしていいのかも不安になります。まずは、泊りがけではなく日帰り旅行をしてみることで、赤ちゃんだけでなく大人もコツが分かるかもしれません。
そこで、0歳が日帰り旅行できる時期や理想的な移動手段・持ち物・注意点をご紹介します。
関連：近畿地方でおすすめの日帰り旅行
0歳が日帰り旅行できる時期とは？
0歳の赤ちゃんと旅行をする場合、何ヶ月から可能という決まりはありません。しかし、首がすわる3ヶ月頃までは控えるのが望ましいです。0ヶ月～1ヶ月の赤ちゃんは室内で過ごすのが基本とされています。まだ、体の免疫機能や体力が十分ではないため、感染などのリスクが高いからです。
また、日光に当たり過ぎるのもよくなく、室内で過ごして徐々に外気浴で慣らします。1ヶ月健診の後は出かけてもいいとされていますが、一般的には近場での買い物や公園のみです。里帰り先が遠い実家の場合、1ヶ月～2ヶ月頃に新幹線や飛行機で帰る時もあります。
ただし、赤ちゃんの負担にならないことを第一に考え、寄り道しないのが一般的です。3ヶ月を過ぎて首がすわると、抱っこ紐やチャイルドシート・ベビーカーでの移動がしやすくなります。数時間の移動もできるようになるため、この頃から日帰り旅行を検討するといいでしょう。
ただし、それぞれの赤ちゃんや母親によって、体調や機嫌は異なります。よって、大人の都合だけで日帰り旅行を強行するのは避けましょう。
0歳との日帰り旅行ではどのような移動手段がいい？
日帰り旅行の移動手段は車や電車・バス・飛行機などですが、車での移動が理想とされています。その理由として、車なら多くの荷物を載せることができ、赤ちゃんが泣いても、他人の視線が気にならないからです。公共の交通機関で赤ちゃんが泣くと、他人に迷惑をかけていないかと焦り、旅行を楽しめない人もいます。
ま た、0歳の赤ちゃんは、おむつやおしりふきだけでなく、ミルク用品や着替えも必要です。万が一のトラブルを想定して、予備を持っていく場合もあります。つまり、使わない持ち物も持っていく可能性があり、多くの荷物を載せられる車が理想なのです。
自家用車がない場合は、日帰り旅行の日だけレンタカーを借りるのもいいでしょう。電車やバス・飛行機でも多くの荷物を持っていけますが、持ち物は自分で持たないといけません。荷物が重すぎると気持ち的に余裕がなくなる可能性が高いです。
予備の荷物も最低限にするため、何かのトラブルがあった時に焦ってしまう場合もあります。電車やバス・飛行機での日帰り旅行の場合、予備の荷物を持っていくことも重要ですが、「現地で調達してもいい」と気持ちに余裕をもって出掛けましょう。
日帰り旅行の持ち物とは？
0歳の赤ちゃんがいる日帰り旅行では、保険証や母子手帳は必ず持っていきます。もし、具合が悪くなったり、怪我をしたりした場合は、旅行先の病院に行くケースが多いです。その際、保険証や母子手帳が必要になります。
また、おむつやおしりふき・ミルク用品・離乳食なども多めに持っていくことが大切です。日帰り旅行の場合、おむつは5枚～10枚、おしりふきは1パックで十分でしょう。ただし、環境の変化で下痢をする場合もあるため、バッグに余裕がある時には多めに持っていくのも手段です。
おむつ替えはおむつ交換台だけでなく、車の中で交換する場合もあります。よって、使用済みおむつを入れるための袋も数枚持っていきましょう。0歳は授乳や離乳食が必要になります。母乳の場合は授乳ケープを持っていくのが望ましいです。
旅行先ではどこで授乳するのかはっきりしないため、車の中でも授乳できるようにケープを持っていきましょう。ミルクを飲んでいる場合は、あらかじめ必要なミルクの粉をミルカーに入れておくと効率がいいです。ミルカーから哺乳瓶に入れれば、ミルク作りの手間が減ります。
また、ミルク用のお湯を水筒に入れて持っていくといいでしょう。熱湯が入った水筒とぬるま湯が入った水筒の2つを持っていくのがおすすめです。外出先でお湯をもらえる可能性もありますが、基本的には持参したお湯で作るのを心掛けます。
6ヶ月を過ぎると離乳食を食べ始めるため、それ以降の日帰り旅行では離乳食の準備が必要です。手作りの離乳食を食べている場合は、手作りのものをお弁当で持っていっても構いません。ただし、傷みやすいため、市販のレトルトパウチ離乳食を食べさせてもいいでしょう。
服装では、予備のシャツとロンパースなどを各2枚ずつ持っていきます。また、赤ちゃんの気分転換になるおもちゃも必需品です。公共の交通機関を使う場合は、ぬいぐるみや絵本など大きな音が出ないおもちゃを持っていきましょう。
車での移動では、音が出るおもちゃの方が泣き止みます。例えば、音が出る絵本やカチャカチャと鳴るおもちゃが最適です。
日帰り旅行の注意 点1 「 混雑日を避ける 」
混雑が予想されるゴールデンウィークや年末年始は、公共機関や高速道路・レジャー施設が混んでいます。渋滞や混雑を避けるためには、混雑日ではなく、平日や長期休暇以外が望ましいです。ゴールデンウィーク中に日帰り旅行をしたい場合は、最終日は比較的すいています。
また、大型のサービスエリアは混んでいるため、小型のパーキングでトイレを済ませるのもいいでしょう。
日帰り旅行の注意点2「事前に授乳室やお店の有無を確認する」
事前に授乳室やお店の有無を確認し、行先の計画に入れておくのが理想的です。例えば、ミルクを飲む場合、お湯を提供してくれる授乳室を事前に調べておき、そこへ30分前後立ち寄る計画を立てておきます。近くのドラッグストアやショッピングモール・病院なども調べておけば、万が一の時に焦りません。
おむつ替えや授乳室・コンビニがあるサービスエリアも調べておくと、車移動での休憩場所も決めやすいです。
日帰り旅行の注意点3「季節に合わせて持ち物を考えよう」
季節に合わせて持ち物を考えることが大切です。夏は汗をかくため、着替えのシャツや汗とりパッドが必要になります。紫外線対策として、日焼け止めや水遊び時はラッシュガードがあると便利です。虫が多い時期は、虫よけや刺された時のかゆみ止めも持っていきます。
秋から冬は防寒対策として、ブランケットや羽織れるものを持っていきましょう。
0歳と日帰り旅行をする時には、事前の下調べが大切！

He informed the group that over the last year , in four critical states the GOP needs to hold huge purges of the voter rolls have just been finished .
The insider did not say which four states , but did say Ohio was among them .
His claim was a new Diebold voter registry system had been installed over the last year .
The last week of July and the first week of August a " test run " was made of the systems ability to purge ineligable voters .
The purge generated names and test letters sent out to 1.2 million Ohio addresses with a focus on University 's , Apartment addresses with high turnover .
He claims they made the letters seem just functionary , but they have an action component to avoid being purged from the rolls .
The Insider warmed and said that Blackwell was brilliant in how he did this .
The letter went on for a long time about changes in Ohio voting and security and suggested people who might have any concerns about their voting status could come by county offices and confirm their continued voting eligability before election day .
He further added , that since it was conducted as a " test " they only sent letters to a limited number of suspect addresses and " I suspect Blackwell chose criteria very very favorable for us . "
Further the insider stated that Blackwell had only purged the lists after a full 60 days was given for people to respond .
Which means even if a voter was on the " termination " list , they would still have been eligable to vote in the primary .
He told they table they believe the purge has probably caught up " hundreds of thousands of students , activists and wanderers with no real job " would show up at the polls and have to vote provisionally .
He predicted to the table that tens of thousands of voters will show up on election day , and once the provisionals are used up will simply not be able to at all .
He also said that this " operation " ( The Insiders word , my friend was specific about this " had turned up a lot of additional fascinating information including a number of Democrats in elected office who are registered to vote in several places , and they may explore how to use this information against them .
I am going to assume , Mr. Blackwell 's " test " purge went to no - one registered GOP .
His criteria is something I am trying to get a copy of now .
Friday I called friends in Lorain County and Wayne County Ohio .
I told them this DC tale .
Neither of them had voted yet and I asked them if they could go on Monday to either early vote , or apply for an absentee ballot .
And if possible sit for in the Elections Office for an hour and determine if anyone was expressiing surprise they were no longer registered .
If the sample of 11 AM - 1 PM in Lorain County Ohio and 10 AM - 11 AM in Wayne County Ohio are true .
Then Ohio Democratic Voters had better go and Vote Early if they plan to vote at all .
At Lorain County , my friend arrived to find a line of over 15 people , many of whom had come back for a second time , all of them Democrats who had arrived to vote and been told that Drivers Liscence Information , or in one case Home Ownership Information had not matched the address provided for Voter Registration .
In one case a college student had been purged because he had changed dorms on campus .
In another case a local blue - collar worker had been purged because his voter registration had only his building address , but his drivers liscense included an apartment number .
This tiny difference in information had led to his purging .
While everyone present seemed to have enough information to allow the records to be updated , my friend told me it was being done by one and only one clerk and was taking a very long time , about 5 minutes per person to resolve .
Everyone in line confirmed that several voters had given up in frustration and left .
In Wayne County the sample is smaller , but during the one hour he stated 18 people arrived for absentee ballots or to vote early .
Wayne County had 3 Diebold TSX Touch Screens set up for early voters .
Of those who arrived two of them had been provisionally purged .
The first was again a student from a local college , she was sent away and told she had to bring some ID beyond her student ID to prove she was resident at the College .
She was wearing a Sherrod Brown button .
The second was a local guy who owns two houses on the same block .
His drivers liscence is to the one house where he keeps his cars , but his voter roll is in his house where he actually sleeps four houses away .
This got resolved with a series of steps that included filling out two forms , and a clerk having to enter the corrected information into two seperate computers .
As an added bonus , My friend listened in and witnessed 8 retired ladies getting instructions on how to be poll workers on the new TSX machines .
The instructor was a local elections board member .
She was asked many questions by one of the retirees and her answer to almost all of them was " I do n't know how it works , I just know how we are supposed to use it "
Get ready Ohio .
This story also may explain Mr. Blackwell 's sudden discovery of the " two homes and is he really a qualifed Voter " now facing Strickland .
This Blackwell discovery of Mr. Strickland is actually " by - catch " of the much larger net thrown to eliminate hundred of thousands of democrats from the voting rolls .
ACTION : Get to your election boards , bring all the documentation you can .
Demand a paper absentee ballot .
Alert a everyone you know in Ohio .
Good luck out there .
This does n't eliminate the fact your Diebold System is utterly hackable , but it certainly explains how Rove plans to drag all your races into the margin of error so hitting the Diebold Button to steal the election does n't look so obvious .
He has taken away your right to vote based on any piece of mismatched information in your state records .
I would expect that would be nearly everyone if the test was applied across the board .
But I suspect it was not done that way by Mr. Blackwell .
It might be worth other states starting to look at this issue as well .
They are very much in love with the power they have my friends .
I am increasing afraid this one one ends as another of my friends now says very often : " By Feeding the Tree of Liberty . "
One of the most common wine questions I get is , " How do you tell if a bottle of a wine that you got at a restaurant is bad ?
I never know when to send one back . "
Let me start by saying what does not constitute a bad bottle .
A bottle is not bad just because you do n't like the wine .
There are many variations in wine - making style , so a bottle that does n't suit your preferences is not necessarily defective .
Of course , the sommelier should help you select a bottle that 's to your liking , but ultimately only you are responsible for your personal tastes .
A bottle is not bad just because the label is damaged .
Most wine travels thousands of miles to get to you , and there are plenty of opportunities for bumping and grinding .
Likewise , in a cellar where thousands of bottles are stored together , one bottle can break , leaking wine onto hundreds of others .
This does not affect the wine inside the intact bottles .
A bottle is not bad just because it has little white crystals accumulated at the bottom or adhering to the cork .
These crystals ( called tartrate ) are a natural by - product of unfiltered , unprocessed fine wines and are totally harmless .
A bottle is not " corked " just because it has bits of cork in it ( all this means is that an inexperienced waiter pushed the corkscrew all the way through the cork , thus forcing pieces into the wine ) or because it has an unsightly or even moldy cork .
The term corked has a very specific meaning , which I 'll explain in a moment .
There are essentially four things that constitute defects in a bottle of wine such that you should send it back :
It can be corked , oxidized , maderized or refermented .
Corked
Corks are natural products , and some microorganisms like to eat them .
A wine is properly said to be corked when it has come in contact with a contaminated cork during the aging process .
The results of this contamination are almost always unmistakable :
The wine will smell like a wet basement after a flood or dirty socks left in the hamper a little too long : moldy , nasty and not at all enticing to the taster .
On the palate , it will be astringent , lacking in fruit , with a raspy finish .
Sometimes you may even notice a paint - thinner quality .
Still , when you catch a wine in the earliest stages of being corked , there may be some doubt -- here , all I can say is that the more you taste wine , the higher sensitivity you will attain in identifying corked wines .
Also , if a wine is served too cold , you may not catch the telltale aromas on the initial offering .
This is n't your fault , and you are still well within your rights to send the bottle back once the defect becomes clear .
You cannot , however , discover a corked wine by smelling the cork .
Many fine wines have issued from bottles with funky - smelling corks , and vice versa .
Oxidized
Oxygen is wine 's invisible enemy , and when a wine gets exposed to air , it becomes " oxidized . "
The result is flat , lifeless wine that loses its pretty , vibrant fruit scents and tastes insipid -- it will likely remind you of vinegar .
The trained eye will also often notice a certain dullness in the color .
In whites , it can be light to dark yellow or even brownish .
It is much less obvious in red wines .
Maderized
Heat is another destructive force exerted on wine , usually as a result of bad storage .
When one says a wine is " maderized , " it has been literally baked ( this often happens in the holds of cargo ships as they cross the oceans in summertime ) .
It actually tastes like Madeira and is reminiscent of almonds and candied fruits -- admirable qualities in dessert wines but unacceptable in dry wines .
You may also notice , in the unopened bottle , that the cork is pushed partly out of the neck ( due to expansion within ) .
Refermented
Fine wine is a living thing , the product of controlled fermentation .
Occasionally , some residual , dormant yeasts will wake up , and a wine will undergo a second fermentation after it has been released and shipped .
This manifests itself as effervescence , or fizziness , on the tongue .
Of course , this is desirable in champagne ( which is purposely refermented in the bottle in order to create the bubbles ) , but never in fine still wine .
It 's difficult to learn to identify these flaws just by reading about them .
Only experience and time will give you the training you need to spot every defect .
But if you think a bottle is bad , ask the sommelier for confirmation .
Do n't be afraid -- at any reputable establishment the sommelier will not take a rejected bottle personally ( not that you should care if he or she does ) .
It is , after all , a statistical certainty that a certain percentage of wines will go bad through no fault of the restaurant .
Some of these we can return to our distributors for credit ; with others we 'll just take the loss .
We compute our wine prices with the expectation that we 'll get some bad bottles .
If we honestly think you 're crazy and believe with all our hearts that the bottle is perfect , we 'll still take it back -- and maybe later have a glass ourselves .

As a nation , we can and should engage in vigorous debates over whether a military offensive against Iran is desirable , prudent , disastrous , or just plain crazy .
But it is just as crucial that we realize that the Bush administration has embraced theories of executive power which assert that the president has the authority to initiate a military attack on Iran regardless of whether the American people , or their representatives in Congress , approve of such an attack .
. . .
As the Iran debate proceeds , it is necessary to remember that the president believes he is the " sole organ " in all such matters , and he has full , limitless and unchecked authority to do whatever he wants .
The President 's Constitutional Authority to Conduct Military Operations Against Terrorists and the Nations Supporting Them .
BYRD : Do you believe the president has the authority , under either the 9/11 war resolution or the Iraq war resolution , to attack Iran or to attack Syria ?
GATES : To the best of my knowledge of both of those authorizations , I do n't believe so .
inherently
not
April , 2006
Last October , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was asked by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee whether the president would circumvent congressional authorization if the White House chose military action against Iran or Syria .
She answered , " I will not say anything that constrains his authority as commander - in - chief . "
When pressed by Senator Paul Sarbanes about whether the administration can exercise a military option without an authorization from Congress , Rice replied , " The president never takes any option off the table , and he should n't . "
The Boston Globe
not
" I was not enthusiastic about going to Congress for an additional grant of authority , " Cheney recalled in a 1996 PBS " Frontline " documentary .
" I was concerned that they might well vote ' no ' and that would make life more difficult for us . "
i.e .
But I think if you look at things like the War Powers Act , for example , adopted in the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict , that that was an infringement on the President 's ability to deploy troops .
It 's never really been tested .
I think it 's probably unconstitutional .
MATTHEWS : Tony , will the president ask Congress ‘ approval before any attack on Iran ?
TONY SNOW , WHITE PRESS SECRETARY :
You ‘re getting way ahead of yourself , Chris .
Nobody here is talking about attacks on Iran . . . .
MATTHEWS :
Well , he did say we ‘re going to disrupt the attacks on our forces , we will interrupt the flow of support from Iran .
Does that mean stopping at the Iranian border or going into Iran ?
SNOW : Well , again , I think what the president is talking about is the war in Iraq , Chris .
MATTHEWS :
So he will seek congressional approval before any action against Iran ?
SNOW : You are talking about something we ‘re not even discussing ...
MATTHEWS : Well , you are , Tony , because — look at this .
I recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region . ”
Is n‘t that about Iran ?
SNOW : It ‘s about — yes , it is , in part .
And what it is , is it ‘s saying , “ Look , we are going to make sure that anybody who tries to take aggressive action .
But when Bill Clinton sent a carrier task force into the South China Sea after the North Koreans fired a missile over Japan , that was not as a prelude to war against North Korea .
You know how it works .
. . .
MATTHEWS :
My concern is we ‘re going to see a ginning - up situation whereby we follow in hot pursuit any efforts by the Iranians to interfere with Iraq .
We take a couple shots at them , they react .
Then we bomb the hell out of them and hit their nuclear installations without any action by Congress .
That ‘s the scenario I fear , an extra-constitutional war is what I ‘m worried about .
SNOW : Well , you ‘ve been watching too , too many old movies featuring your old friend Slim Pickens is what you ‘re doing now , come on .
MATTHEWS : No , I ‘ve been watching the war in Iraq is what I ‘ve been watching .
As long as you say to me before we leave tonight that the president has to get approval from Congress before making war on Iran .
SNOW : Let me put it this way .
The president understands you ‘ve got to have public support for whatever you do .
The reason we ‘re talking to the American public about the high stakes in Iraq and why it is absolutely vital to succeed is you ‘ve got to have public support .
And the president certainly , whenever he has taken major actions , he has gone before Congress .

D.B. has the details .
As she demonstrates , Congress specifically refused to include that language because it did not want to authorize military action against Iran ( or Syria ) .
: As
QUESTION : Do you believe if the President chose to embark on military action with Iran , he would go to Congress for authorization first ?
SECRETARY RICE : I 'm not going to speculate on that .
The President is clear that he keeps all of his options on the table .
But ,
Tim , I think speculating about how we might set up military action is n't helpful at a time when we really are concentrating on the diplomacy .
But I want to be very clear --
QUESTION : But you would n't go to Congress ?
SECRETARY RICE : Well , Tim , of course the Administration went to Congress the last time .
And I would just ask people to look at the history of how this President has acted .
He has taken Congress as a full partner in these matters .
But I 'm not going to get into a discussion of what the President may or may not do constitutionally .
( Rice was even
Rice , of course , is correct that the administration sought and obtained Congressional approval before invading Afghanistan and Iraq , but it did so only when it was assured beforehand that Congress would provide such authorization ( I recall Joe Biden , during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , all but begging the administration not to invade Iraq without first allowing Congress to authorize the war ) .
It seems highly unlikely that the administration could obtain authorization to attack Iran , which means that its prior requests for authorization hardly constitutes evidence that they would not attack Iran without first seeking Congressional approval .
to insert language into the 2002 Iraq AUMF which would likely have authorized military force against Iran by allowing the use of force to " restore international peace and security in the region .
" D.B. has the details .
As she demonstrates , Congress specifically refused to include that language because it did not want to authorize military action against Iran ( or Syria ) . :
As Silent Patriot notes in Comments , Rice , in March of 2006 , was also asked by Tim Russert whether the President had the power to attack Iran without Congressional approval , and she evaded the question then , too , again by implying that the President might have that authority : ( Rice was even more evasive when asked this same question yesterday by Jim Webb ) .
Rice , of course , is correct that the administration sought and obtained Congressional approval before invading Afghanistan and Iraq , but it did so only when it was assured beforehand that Congress would provide such authorization ( I recall Joe Biden , during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , all but begging the administration not to invade Iraq without first allowing Congress to authorize the war ) .
It seems highly unlikely that the administration could obtain authorization to attack Iran , which means that its prior requests for authorization hardly constitutes evidence that they would not attack Iran without first seeking Congressional approval .
In response to Joe Biden 's warning to Condoleezza Rice that an attack on Iran would " generate a constitutional confrontation in the Senate , " Josh Marshall says : " A comment like that does n't come out of the blue . "
Maybe , but it is worth underscoring what the administration 's views are as to its authority to attack Iran .
Last April , Seymour Hersh wrote an article inwarning that the administration " has increased clandestine activities inside Iran and intensifed planning for a possible major air attack . "
That article was published just as I was finishing writing , and so I added an Epilogue examining the Bush administration 's views as to the President 's power to commence a war , or order an attack , against Iran .
The Epilogue emphasizes that the radical theories of presidential power adopted by the administration ( and applied to general lawbreaking , warrantless eavesdropping , torture , indefinite detentions of U.S. citizens ) applied clearly and fully to Iran , , that those theories -- which were and the formally adopted positions of the Executive Branch -- absolutely mean that the President has the power to commence a war with Iran , and that not only would he not need Congressional approval to do so , but Congress
The rationale and documentation on which I based those conclusions are set forth here here , and here .
The title of the infamous Yoo Memorandum -- the Bible of Onimpotent Presidential Power Theories -- is : The Bush administration has not changed one comma in any of its formally adopted positions concerning presidential power , and that Memorandum standing alone , along with multiple other sources ( discussed in the linked posts ) , leave no do doubt as to the administration 's views .
At the Senate confirmation hearing of Robert Gates last month , this exchange occurred with Sen.
Byrd : That does not really answer the question as to whether the President has authorityto attack Iran ( as opposed to whether he has authority under the two prior Resolutions ) , but to the extent Gates was stating that additional Congressional authorization would be needed , that is plainlythe expressed position of the Bush administration .
The only time previously that I am aware of when a top Bush official was asked that question was when Condoleezza Rice appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee inOctober , 2005 .
She suggested ( albeit evasively ) that the President had the inherent power to attack Iran :
It should be a top priority ( of Congressional Democrats and the media ) to get a clear answer from the administration on this question now , rather than , say , after hostilities have commenced ( more so than they have already ) . :
The superb Charlie Savage of reported last November that Vice President Cheney actually urged the first President Bush ( when Cheney was his Defense Secretary ) to seek Congressional approval for the Persian Gulf War , arguing that the President had the power to start whatever wars he wanted regardless of whether Congress approved or not :
Notice that , in Cheney 's mind , if Congress had voted " no " on the question of whether to declare war ( or provide the President with the authorization to use military force ) , that would not have meant that they could n't start the war .
It just would have " made life more difficult " for them .
Those who control the Bush administration do not believe that they need Congressional approval to wage wars , or even that Congress has any power to prevent such wars once the President decides war is necessary for American security . :
As JAO notes in Comments , the War Powers Act of 1973 -- enacted over the veto of Richard Nixon -- requires the President to obtain authorization from Congress if military forces are to be deployed for greater than 60 days , which also can be understood to mean that the President is free to deploy the military for up to 60 days without Congressional approval ( the scope of that power , , the circumstances under which the President can do so , is unclear and disputed ) .
But even that very mild and permissive framework is rejected by Dick Cheney as an unconstitutional abridgment of the President 's powers :
That was from a speech Cheney gave in June , 2006 , so he has been thinking about this issue , obviously .
It seems clear based on this statement ( and Cheney has made the same point many times ) that the Bush administration does not accept , and would not adhere to , even the modest limitations placed by the 1973 War Powers
Act on the President 's power to order military action . : Kudos to Chris Matthews , who last night tried diligently and repeatedly ( though unsuccessfully ) to pin down the always evasive Tony Snow on the question of whether the President would seek Congressional authorization before attacking Iran ( h/t reader RK ) :
In light of all the known facts , I think a prudent , rational person would take Snow 's non-answer to be a decisive " no " in response to the inquiry as to whether the President would require or seek Congressional approval before waging war on Iran .
Until one hears otherwise , definitively and unambiguously from the administration , that is the only reasonable working assumption . :
The always astute Dover Bitch ( one of the joys of blogging - the most unlikely phrases flow so abundantly from one 's mouth ) makes an important and interesting point

This Russian city was known in 90s as “ crime capital of Russia ” , many Russian mafia leaders lived there , and many of them participated in gang wars , as a result many of them now rest in peace on this cemetery .
They always liked tombs like those , the production of such tomb also costs thousands of dollars .

Not being able to sing Happy Birthday might mean you 're tone - deaf .
But what if you can't actually tell the difference between it and the National Anthem ?
That 's where a condition called amusia comes in - and here 's a test to find out if it affects you .
More than one in 10 of us claim to be tone - deaf ; but despite the term , most tone - deaf people can hear music perfectly well - they just can't sing .
A different condition , however , does involve a problem in making sense of music .
Research has shown that some people , termed " amusic " , can neither produce nor perceive music .
It is n't a problem of the ears - they can understand other sounds perfectly well - but when it comes to music , all tunes sound the same ( See links below for the test ) .
While most of us are sensitive to small changes in pitch , amusic people need two notes to be very far apart before they hear them as different .
It 's no surprise , then , that music , which tends to move in small steps , is literally " lost " on them .
THOSE WITH AMUSIC ...
Ca n't recognise familiar tunes
Think they sing in tune , but other people tell otherwise Don't " get " music and rarely choose to listen to it
Click here to do the test
Anne Vere , an amusic from Newcastle , describes music as an " irritant " .
When she heard the theme tune to Brief Encounter , voted the UK 's favourite piece of classic music for the past five years , she described it as " banging that would be best avoided " .
But unless willing to shut themselves off from the many social occasions in which music plays a role , amusics must endure whatever life 's jukebox throws at them .
Anne recalls times when she was asked to go to a friend 's house to listen to music : " Parties , dinner dances , work dos , I really , really dreaded these occasions . "
The behaviour of another amusia sufferer goes beyond passive endurance .
She confesses that she puts a CD on the stereo whenever she entertains guests as a way of covering up for her own lack of musical affinity .
Lost in music
For some amusia sufferers , avoiding music is not an option , for the simple reason that singing is part of the job description .
Until he retired , the Reverend Jim Cross was required to sing in parts of his Sunday services .
He says of his singing ability : " I am told that sometimes I get the right note , and sometimes I do not , but I cannot tell . "
His congregation , however , had no trouble in spotting when Jim went off - key and eventually gave him special dispensation to simply say the lines aloud .
I am told that sometimes I get the right note , and sometimes I do not , but I cannot tell
Ex-rector Jim Cross
A team headed by Isabelle Peretz at the University of Montreal has pioneered research into the disorder , devising a test which can diagnose whether people are likely to be amusic or not .
In the test , two tunes are played which may be identical or may differ at a single point .
If the difference is a change in pitch , people with amusia will not spot it , even if the change is glaringly obvious , causing the tune to go out of key .
Comics such as Les Dawson may have built a comedy career out of such musical blunders , but people with amusia just do n't hear the joke .
Family affair
In the general population , there appears to be a great deal of variability in people 's capacity to spot differences between tunes .
The individual differences in this ability have been shown to be , in large part , genetically determined .
Denis Drayna , from the National Institute of Health in the United States , measured performance of identical twins ( who share all their DNA ) and non-identical twins ( who share only half their DNA ) on a test of musical listening .
He showed that the identical twins performed much more similarly on the test , and estimated that between 70 % and 80 % of the variability in performance can be accounted for by the genes .
The ability to differentiate is genetic
And as researchers learn more about what amusia sufferers can and can't perceive , there is always the possibility that this knowledge could help sufferers gain access to a musical world .
Just as deaf people learn to enjoy music through its vibrations , people with amusia may be able to choose their listening material according to their residual abilities .
Most amusia sufferers can hear rhythm in music , and most can dance .
If the banging of Rachmaninov 's piano concerto does n't make it on to their iPod , perhaps some drum and bass could set their feet tapping .
This seems very similar to how I would describe my colourblind condition .
Colours or shades have to be very different before I really notice the difference .
I can't see pastels , I need big and bold .
Both these conditions affect the senses , so there is probably something similar with smells and tastes too !
Tim Fountain , Beaconsfield
More than half of the world 's languages are ' tonal ' , i.e. where tones contribute as much as consonants and vowels to the meaning of a word ( examples include Mandarin , Vietnamese , Norwegian , Igbo , and thousands of others ) .
So an inability to hear tones in such languages would render communication impossible .
It would be fascinating to see whether amusic folks could distinguish tone differences in languages that they fail to distinguish in music , thus distinguishing these important cognitive domains .
Daniel Everett , Manchester , England
What a shame Dr Stewart chooses to spoil an otherwise interesting article by referring , in the final paragraph , to the ' banging of Rachmaninov 's piano concerto ' .
Even if she does not herself suffer from amusia , then I fear she is demonstrating her own ' unmusicality ' and ignorance of the concert repertoire .
Music lovers everywhere know there are several Rachmaninov piano concertos to choose from !
Furthermore , if she hears ' banging ' , then that is the fault of the soloist rather than the music .
Anthony Short , Reading , England
I 'd be interested to know if people with amusia speak in a monotone .
If not , how are they managing to hear and imitate normal speech intonation ?
This is much harder to distinguish than musical pitch .
Stress in speech , especially for native English speakers is also subtle compared to musical rhythms .

The Attack on Public Sector Pensions Will Accelerate ( December 5 , 2005 )
The pension crisis that began in the steel industry and swept through the airlines and auto industries is now moving on to the public sector .
Defined benefit pension plans are in jeopardy as state and local governments move to end these plans and shift to 401 ( k ) - type plans for public employees .
The Economy
The Perpetuation of Poverty and Race Discrimination ( November 15 , 2005 )
U.S. unemployment rates have historically moved along racial lines in a recovery , but Bush administration policies have created even sharper distinctions between the employment opportunities for white and black workers .
Workers with less education – overwhelmingly black and locked into large metropolitan areas – are still unemployed at triple the rates for white workers .
But the administration and its allies in Congress are cutting back federal funding for the very programs that could help black youths enter college and end a long - standing cycle of poverty , leaving them instead to fall into the ranks of the chronically unemployed and underemployed .
Pensions
The Larger Pension Question Looms ( October 31 , 2005 )
A retirement based only on Social Security benefits and 401( k ) payouts will leave most Americans in poverty .
Pensions have made the difference between a modest but adequate retirement and financial disaster for millions of elderly Americans .
The U.S. retirement system has long rested on the assumption that workers would draw from three sources of retirement income : Social Security , pension plans and personal savings , which now commonly take the form of employee contributions to 401 ( k ) s .
Without pensions , the system is not valid .

Union Advantage For Benefits Grows Wider ( October 11 , 2005 )
Union workers receive employer - paid benefits that far exceed the benefits employers provide for nonunion workers , and the union advantage is growing wider .
For years , employers have been canceling benefit coverage and shifting more of the remaining costs to workers .
Unions have been able to fight off this employer attack on benefits , but nonunion workers have been left with inadequate health care protections and no retirement security .

Labor unions around the United States and throughout the world are rallying to aid the people whose lives have been thrown into chaos by Hurricane Katrina .
Many unions have created special disaster relief funds to help out .
Volunteers are also needed .

Wages
Labor ’s Smaller Share ( September 2 , 2005 )
This Labor Day marks yet another year of decline in the living standards of U.S. workers .
The downward trend in real wages has continued for so long that workers no longer expect an annual wage increase .
And the assault on benefits is now so entrenched that many workers do n’t receive or expect to receive basic benefits .
Wages
Workers Left out of the Recovery , Wages Remain Flat ( August 11 , 2005 )
The most recent round of economic reports points to higher growth in all parts of the economy except one : wages .
Wage increases are weak and are forecast to remain low in 2006 .

Breaking Through the Noise Part II : How Grassroots Campaigns Can Have an Impact on Capitol Hill ( August 8 , 2005 )
These days it 's easier to send a letter to your congressman , but it 's harder to be heard and even harder to have a real impact .
For unions and other policy - oriented member organizations , it 's still possible , but only if groups follow the new rules that are required to break through the noise in Washington .
Hundreds of Britons are being urged to attend what is being branded as Europe 's first " Masturbate - a - thon " , a leading British reproductive healthcare charity said .
Marie Stopes International , which is hosting the event with HIV / AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust , said it expected up to 200 people to attend the sponsored masturbation session in Clerkenwell , central London , on Sunday .
" It is a bit of a publicity stunt but we hope it will raise awareness , " a Marie Stopes spokeswoman said .
No lock in
Integration
Leveraging existing skills
Ability to fix bugs / issues without depending on a vendor .
The Flash programming language ( ActionScript ) is 100 % ECMASCript , a standard with multiple implementations and is open .
You can script using ActionScript with a plain old text editor .
The internal Flash Player VM , “ Tamarin ” is an open source project run by the Mozilla foundation ( donated by Adobe ) .
The Flash file format , *.SWF is a published format .
The Flash Player is available on Mac , Windows , Linux , Playstation , Nintendo Wii , Symbion , and many other platforms .
An SDK for building , compiling , debugging Flash applications is available for free on Mac , Windows and Linux There is a very active Open Source community around the Flash runtime .
For better or worse ( I do work for Adobe - ; ) many many people take full advantage of the Flash Player without using any commercial products from Adobe ( or anyone belse ) .
See http://www.osflash.org/
to get a good view of this .
Flash itself makes use of several standards such as JPG , AVI , GIF and PNG's as outlined here .
With Java open sourced and Microsoft unlikely to start open sourcing their software stack anytime soon , Flash stands and one of the most widely used technologies driving the internet which is not open source .
Duane Nickull has written a starting point for the debate .
In summary he asks what does open flash mean to developers .
In Nickull 's experience open means : Nickull also references a post made by David Mendels of Adobe in relation to the issue .
Among the points of Mendels he summaries :
All of this raises the question " Is Flash Open Enough ? " .
This same question was asked of Java for many years before the its open sourcing in 2006

If you want to make a geek laugh derisively , suggest that responsibility for computer security be turned over to the government .
This reaction is guaranteed , regardless of ideology .
Everyone knows that this is not possible , but rarely are the implications for political economy noted .
Now , keep in mind that geeks know that producing fabulous looking and acting things for the web is only part of the job .
These are people who spend a fantastic amount of time dealing with security issues , which change every season , day , hour , and even minute .
People know about viruses .
Spyware and adware , meanwhile , are incredible threats to people 's home computers .
A new computer can be slowed to a crawl in a few days of quick browsing without good security against hijackings .
And a huge industry has sprung up promising solutions , some good and some almost as dangerous as the thing they allegedly stop .
Some of these are free , and some quite expensive , and the typical geek must work to discover what 's what .
Other threats are less well known , such as the possibility that your own computer can be hijacked and controlled by other people who want to use it to store files or scan for other hijackable ports .
This is mainly a threat faced by servers running large websites — huge magnets for hijackings and hacks — but it even affects home computers .
For example : I was recently talking to a technical administrator of a prestigious host of thousands of servers .
He was amazed by the number of root - level compromises that had been taking place in recent months .
The possible holes in people 's systems are without limit .
Software must be constantly upgraded .
Even one small mistake can lead to data loss and disaster .
He tried a little experiment .
He installed a new operating system on a new laptop , and disabled the firewall .
He then hooked it up to a non-secure wireless network in an urban area .
The first attack came in 6 minutes .
In 12 minutes , the computer had already been hacked and was under the control of somebody or something else .
All data on the computer was rendered vulnerable , available for looting or selling .
In a few minutes more , it would have become a work station for more port scanning , denial - of - service attacks , or some other menacing behavior , and been added to the empire of servers being controlled by some of the world 's smartest criminal minds .
Not that a good firewall and secure connection are infallible solutions .
There is always a way in for someone with high - level skills and the will to take the risk .
To keep threats away involves the technical equivalent of street fights between hackers and security professionals .
The fighters have similar skills ; it 's just that one group wears the black hats and one wears white hats .
Some are criminals , some are saviors .
The battle never stops .
And yes , some of them change hats depending on their career prospects .
The fight involves deploying skills that are far beyond what most any normal person could conceive of possessing .
They can run circles around most computer science professors and even run -of - the - mill webmasters .
Some will rant and rave against the security holes in proprietary products such as those offered by Microsoft .
And users of Internet Explorer would be likely to agree .
The thing has n't been properly updated in many years .
It has not kept pace with the times , and so attracts web - based evil like a landfill attracts flies .
Other products , however , are different .
Server - level software is constantly monitored for holes , with updates sent out automatically and often ( though not always as often as the people might like ) .
Still , open - source advocates say that this proprietary stuff is expensive and dangerous .
The companies do n't respond soon enough to threats , and no one but company employees can view the underlying code .
That means that improvements come more slowly .
With open source , the world community of programmers have access and work constantly to improve the product .
To be sure , hackers too have access to the same code .
So here too you have a battle between good and evil .
Among the good guys , there is a debate : should software holes be announced publicly ( full disclosure ) in the hope that the firms that work on open source will fix it before the hackers find out ?
But between the announcement and the fix , there is a gap that hackers can exploit .
Perhaps then the hole should only be revealed to the firm or individuals who manage the open - source product ( limited disclosure ) .
The downside here is that the people responsible will lack the frantic sense of urgency that generates a quick hot - fix .
Geeks thrive in emergencies , while non-emergencies fail to inspire .
So the debate over security rages furiously : open source or proprietary code , public security announcements or quiet revelations , development or risk ?
At any one time , all solutions are being used , with bulletin boards filling up thousands and thousands of pages of debate based on experience .
Ideology can play a part here but , in the end , it comes down to what works best .
And all the while , the war continues , pushed onward by the relentless pace of development and progress towards better living standards .
We have n't even touched on the war between the virus makers and the virus killers .
The competition here is also intense .
When a new virus is unleashed , the first firm to produce the fix wins new levels of consumer devotion and attention .
A nothing company can become the next big thing by producing a fix for two or three viruses in a row , and doing it before the established firms get there .
An established firm can lose its market edge in a month by failing to update its virus definitions in time .
The difference between winners and losers in this struggle comes down to minutes , not days or weeks .
In this never - ending struggle , there are always tradeoffs between the pace of development and its security risks .
No software is perfect .
They all have bugs .
But people demand development .
The market never rests .
We must all take some risk .
How much is acceptable ?
Competition prevails here too .
A bad choice in favor of security over development can leave a company eating other companies ' dust .
A bad choice in favor of development over security can lead to bankruptcy in the face of a high - stakes security compromise .
Geek personalities reflect this trade - off : some develop on live servers and deploy every beta the hour it appears , while others test and test and prefer only the tried and true .
All these fascinating details aside , keep in mind that the terrain on which these wars rage is wholly market based .
The idea that any public bureaucracy could oversee the process is unthinkable .
So let us ask the question again , so that the reader may join in the derisive laughter : in a world populated by black hats , should the government be the sole wearer of the white hat ?
Actually , is there any point at all in giving a white hat to the state ?
It has no incentive to join the struggle .
It lacks the calculational means to assess the trade - off between security and development .
It lacks the entrepreneurial drive to produce either .
The nature of the bureaucratic organization is to stay put , protect itself , and only move when kicked good and hard by political bosses .
As for the power to do good , how can anyone guarantee that it wo n't quickly become the power to do evil ?
If experience is our guide , the government in a position of authority is more likely to be creating viruses and spyware rather than stop them .
As for the impact of the law , I vaguely seem to recall some legislation passed a few years ago that made spam illegal .
Government can't produce software that can outsmart every hacker .
Not now , not ever .
But the government can violate liberty and waste vast resources in the attempt .
As important as computers have become , there are interesting implications here .
On a day - by - day basis the security of these machines is a far bigger matter than the threat of terrorism .
Whether we like it or not , and regardless of ideology , we all depend on market competition to bring us not only innovation but also to protect us in our dealings with information technology .
It is not a perfect solution .
It can be messy and fallible .
But the market is the strongest and best hope for security , and the alternative is unthinkable .
How interesting that we have been told for , oh , some 400 years , that government is the agency we need to give us the security that markets cannot give us .
There are a thousand rationales why intellectuals have believed this , but none of them seem very robust by comparison to the experience of our times .
UC Berkeley law Professor John Yoo , who as a Justice Department lawyer was one of the Bush administration 's chief legal theorists , summarized its view in his forthcoming book , " War by Other Means " :
" We are used to a peacetime system in which Congress enacts the laws , the president enforces them , and the courts interpret them .
In wartime , the gravity shifts to the executive branch . ''
Bob Egelko has an interesting article in The San Francisco Chronicle today examining how U.S. law has changed over the last five years as a result of the 9/11 attack .
He includes this truly revealing quote from John Yoo : Actually , I 'm pretty sure that it 's always the case in America ( or at least it used to be ) that " Congress enacts the laws , the president enforces them , and the courts interpret them . "
That 's pretty fundamental to how our country works .
In fact , the whole structure of the Constitution is based on that system -- not just the " Peacetime Constitution " we have , but the actual Constitution itself .
The Constitution is actually pretty clear on that score .
Article I says " All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States " -- Article II says the President " shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed " -- Article III says " the judicial Power of the United States , shall be vested in one supreme Court , and in . . . inferior Courts . "
That arrangement is n't really a side detail or something that shifts based on circumstance .
It 's pretty fundamental to the whole system .
In fact , if you change that formula , it is n't really the American system of government anymore .
Someone who says that it 's only sometimes true in America that " Congress enacts the laws , the president enforces them , and the courts interpret them " is someone who does n't understand how the country works .
There is really no other way to put it .
But Yoo -- as he candidly admits -- does n't think that 's how it should work , and , thanks in no small part to him , that is n't how it has been working ever since 9/11 .
To use
Yoo 's formulation , if we were to simply return to a " system in which Congress enacts the laws , the president enforces them , and the courts interpret them , " that would go a long way to alleviating many of this country 's most pressing political problems .
Banksy 's spray paint picture on security wall
Enlarge Image
The nine paintings were created on the Palestinian side of the barrier .
One depicts a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach , while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side .
Banksy 's spokeswoman Jo Brooks said : " The Israeli security forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed at him . "
Banksy said he was threatened by Israeli security forces
The 425 - mile ( 680 - kilometre ) long barrier , made of concrete walls and razor - wire fences , is still being erected by Israeli authorities .
Israel says the structure is necessary to protect the country from suicide bombers , but the International Court of Justice has said it breaches international law .
Banksy , who hails from the UK city of Bristol , never allows himself to be photographed and created the images last week .
Banksy is well known for his art stunts around the world
His previous creations , which critics condemn as stunts , have included a bronze spoof of the statue of Justice from the Old Bailey , London , wearing thigh - high boots and a suspender belt .
He also embarrassed the British Museum by planting a hoax cave painting of a man pushing a supermarket trolley , which he said went unnoticed for three days .
He has also smuggled and hung works in galleries including the Tate Britain in London and the Metropolitan and the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
Jack Straw made two crucial mistakes in his dealings with Tony Blair : one involved the prime minister 's relationship with Gordon Brown and the other Iran .
Mr Straw has said repeatedly that it is " inconceivable " that there will be a military strike on Iran and last month dismissed as " nuts " a report that George Bush was keeping on the table the option of using tactical nuclear weapons against Tehran 's nuclear plants .
But Mr Blair , who sees Iran as the world 's biggest threat , does not agree with his former foreign secretary .
The prime minister argues that , at the very least , nothing should be ruled out in order to keep Iran guessing .
Downing Street phoned the Foreign Office several times to suggest Mr Straw stop going on the BBC Today programme and ruling it out so categorically .
His fate was sealed when the White House called Mr Blair and asked why the foreign secretary kept saying these things .
In any case , Mr Straw had boxed himself in on Iran to the extent that he would have had to resign if a military strike became a reality .
Mr Blair was also irritated by what he saw as Mr Straw 's opportunism in shifting his loyalty towards Mr Brown with unseemly haste in expectation that he would be the next prime minister .
Iran is one of the issues consuming the Foreign Office and Downing Street .
Iraq is the other , and between them they will take up most of Margaret Beckett 's time .
Mrs Beckett will fly to New York on Monday for a meeting with Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , with whom Mr Straw had established a close rapport , and counterparts from France , Germany , Russia and China to discuss a new UN security council resolution on Iran .
Among the first questions the media will ask is whether she too regards the military option as " inconceivable " .
The Foreign Office has taken a battering under Labour .
Part of its portfolio , international development , was hived off in 1997 to become a separate department , with its own cabinet minister .
And now Mr Blair has created a twin power structure in the Foreign Office by appointing a former cabinet member to what had previously been a relatively junior post , minister for Europe .
Despite the importance placed on relations with Washington , the bulk of British trade is with Europe as is the country 's political future .
Britain 's presidency of the EU , though there was a deal in the end , was fraught .
There is a potential for friction in making the European post more high - profile , but the personalities of Mrs Beckett and Geoff Hoon , both government loyalists , do not suggest conflict .

The telescope will conduct a year - round survey
It will conduct a year - round survey , scanning all of the Milky Way galaxy visible in the Northern Hemisphere .
Seti is an exploratory science to scour the cosmos for signatures of technology built by alien beings .
Some experts believe alien societies are at least as likely to use light for communicating as radio transmissions .
Sending laser signals across the cosmos would be a very logical way for ET to reach out
Bruce Betts , Planetary Society
It has been installed at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at Oak Ridge Observatory .
" The opening of this telescope represents one of those rare moments in a field of scientific endeavour when a great leap forward is enabled , " said Bruce Betts , director of projects at the Planetary Society , which funded the telescope .
" Sending laser signals across the cosmos would be a very logical way for ET to reach out ; but until now , we have been ill - equipped to receive any such signal . "
Bright flashes
Astronomers have been using radio telescopes to look for transmissions from an extraterrestrial intelligence since the 1960s .
But some scientists believe that alien civilisations might opt for visible light to communicate .
Previous searches have used radio telescopes to search for signals
Using only present - day terrestrial technology , a bright , tightly focused light beam , such as a laser , can be 10,000 times as bright as its parent star for a brief instant .
Such a beam could be easily observed from enormous distances .
" This new search apparatus performs one trillion measurements per second and expands 100,000 - fold the sky coverage of our previous optical search , " said the optical telescope 's project director , Paul Horowitz of Harvard University , Massachusetts .
The telescope 's custom processors will process the equivalent of all books in print every second .
As the telescope scans strips of sky , it employs a custom - built " camera " containing an array of detectors that can detect a billionth - of - a - second flash of light .
It has been funded by the Planetary Society with support from the Bosack / Kruger Foundation .
If Barack Obama is as good a politician as he is a writer , he will soon be President
This is not a political blog .
I have no interest in politics .
But I have been reading a great book that happens to be written by a politician .
The first time I heard of Barack Obama is when I saw his name springing up on those political signs people put in their front yards in election years .
I knew nothing about him except that he was affiliated with the University of Chicago law school and he was running some hopeless campaign for the U.S. Senate .
I figured the support he was getting in my home town at the time was probably the only support he would get in the whole state .
The city I lived in , Oak Park , is left wing to the point of comedy at times .
For instance , as you cross into the city , a sign informs you that you are entering a nuclear - free zone .
I thought it would take little more than him having a name like “ Barack Obama ” to win over the folks in Oak Park .
I was not paying any attention to the Senate race when I happened to get called at random for a poll being conducted by the Chicago Tribune .
They asked me who I was going to vote for in the upcoming Senate election .
Just out of sympathy and loyalty to the University of Chicago , I said I would vote for Obama .
That way , when the results of the poll came out , he would have a few percent of the electorate behind him and he would n’t feel so bad .
I was flabbergasted when I saw the results of the poll on the front - page of the newspaper a few days later : Obama was in the lead for the democratic primary !
( This , of course , was well before he got tapped to give the keynote address at the Democratic convention . )
I am not very interested in politics , so I did n’t pay much attention to the Senate race ( which eventually was a landslide with Obama crushing — of all people — Alan Keyes ) .
I saw him give two speeches : the Democratic convention one and his acceptance speech the night he won .
Both times , I felt like he cast some sort of spell over me .
When he spoke , I wanted to believe him .
I ca n’t remember another politician ever having that effect on me .
One friend , who knows Barack and who also knew Bobby Kennedy , said he had not seen anyone like Kennedy until he met Barack .
Anyway , all of this is just a long prelude to the fact that I picked up his book The Audacity of Hope and was blown away at how well written it is .
His stories sometimes make me laugh out loud and at other times well up with tears .
I find myself underlining the book repeatedly so I can find the best parts quickly again in the future .
I am also almost certain he wrote the whole thing himself , based on people I know who know him .
I have no interest in politics , yet I am devouring this book .
If you are n’t giving Freakonomics as a Christmas gift this year — probably you gave it to everyone on your list last Christmas 🙂 — this would make a great gift .
I suppose I should n’t be that surprised at what a good writer he is because I read his first book Dreams from My Father two years ago and loved that one as well .
But unlike that first book , written 15 - 20 years ago before he had political ambitions , I thought this new one would just be garbage .
Rarely does a book so exceed my expectations .
Also , I should stress that I do n’t agree with all his political views , but that in no way detracts from the enjoyment of reading the book .
If he has the same effect on others as he does on me , you are looking at a future president .

Say what you see ...
Google has just taken on legions of new workers .
None are being paid - and you might be one of them .
Since workplace computers were hooked up to the internet , office workers have found more ways of wasting time at work , with e-mailed jokes or videos of apparently - amusing accidents .
And then there are the games .
Dr Luis von
Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University estimated that in 2003 , nine billion human hours were spent playing computer solitaire .
To put this in context , the construction of the Panama Canal took 20 million human - hours .
Being a computer scientist , Dr von
Ahn was aware of projects like SETI@home , where volunteers donate " wasted cycles " ( the spare time of their home computers ) to help the Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory look for signs of extra-terrestrial life .
Rather than paying people , I get them to want to label images for free
Dr Luis von Ahn For all the elaborate projects that computers are working on , there are still some things these machines are very poor at .
One of these is seeing .
A computer will recognise that something is an image , but will have no idea what it is an image of .
So a project to , say , label all the images on the web will need to get humans to pitch in and help .
But who is going to sit around saying what they see for hours at a time ?
Enter Dr von
Ahn , with a new game .
" Rather than paying people to label images for me , I get them to want to label images for free . "
How to play
This is the game you might have been playing online : paired up with a stranger , both of you are shown the same image , and both come up with a label for that image that the other will have thought of .
Once you get a match , you move on , building up points .
Wits are pitted against an online partner 's abilities
It 's important to understand how compulsive this simple activity can be : it is a race , and it is rewarding when you find a partner on the same wavelength .
And if a partner fails to label quickly enough , there is the frustration of lost points - even though the rewarding of said points is wholly arbitrary and worthless .
Dr von
Ahn has created a suite of image - labelling games , and noticed many players putting in more than hours each week .
For the public good , he decided to cut players off after 10 hours of continuous play if they had connected from a university computer .
So , many images are getting many labels .
To what end ?
A scientist , of course , should not need to have applications in mind in order to be seized by a challenge .
For his part , Dr von
Ahn talks of better browsing for the visually impaired , and better cataloguing of data .
And when he talked about these things at Google HQ recently , it is not hard to imagine the appeal of the game to his hosts - and their shareholders .
One licensing agreement later , and an academic research project has become a Google Images game - and the results are proliferating .
In fact , you do not even need to be online to be contributing : your strings of guesses are memorised , and other players may be playing against a phantom " you " - or it might even be a phantom " them " against a phantom " you " , building up matches all the time .
Sweatshop potential Having spent time helping out computers with the tasks they cannot do , you might wonder - was this not supposed to be the other way round ?
Dr von
Ahn 's previous contribution to the web was the " captcha " , the distorted string of letters or numbers that have to be decoded before pressing " send " in online forms .
One unintended consequence has been the alleged existence of " captcha sweatshops " in the developing world , where spammers employ humans to decode 12 " captchas " a minute , all day long .
So what might the unintended consequences of the Google Image Labeler be ?
The answer probably depends on how literally to take the Matrix films .
But making humans enjoy helping computers to see things - primarily to see humans - is likely to affect more than web - browsing for the visually impaired .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Think I 'll stick to SETI@home , which I have been running for several years - when I have time to sit at my computer I 'd rather be writing more pages for my websites than playing games , but SETI gets on with it while I 'm asleep or out .
Megan , Cheshire UK its pretty clear what Google 's interest is - millions of properly captioned images will enhance the marketing value of their search engine ...
leslie , canada I had a go at the " game " and while it is fun , I 'm not sure how useful the end labels are going to be .
Most bpil down to picking a predominant colour ina picture like red or black , or having a labal men / women for people in the pictures .
For instance , one of my pictures was a poster for " Moulin Rouge " but do n't expect to get any matches for film , poster , moulin rouge , nicole kidman , etc. - the match we got was for " red " .
Hardly a useful tag for somebody looking for film posters , etc .
Tim , Greisheim , Germany I 'm amazed that people would work for free for a company that 's worth billions !
Andrew , Sutton Coldfield , England sdjlfcclesfjmncmn89
^* I ^& % ^$ %^s\ , kncnln\scn aksdsnc and that 's all I 'll say on the matter till someone pays me .
John Hatchett , Hertford UK intresting .
Very intresting .
jayme , stevenage This sounds AMAZING !
I want to try it now !!!
But I 'm at work and the working I was waiting for my computer to do has just finished so I 've got to get back to it .. this just sound like a so much better thing to do between tasks than endless ego searching or the chat rooms and net working sites I usually spend my down time on !
Andrea Thompson , Waldneil , Germany I was watching some nerdy BBC2 science thing on TV earlier in the week .
A doctor of this - and - that was assuming and theorising and conjecturing and thereforing about something for which nobody really gives a stuff .
It struck me that the more clever your scientific mind , the less likely you are to do something useful with your talents .
I suggest this nonsense validates my theory .

Where can i do this Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie !
Sounds like a bit of fun , Should also cure the hours of boredom at work whilst helping out some one !
I love the idea !
Lee Hamer , Oxford
This is simply theft of service .
All the people who play these games should boycott them .
dian , NYC
This is only the beginning .
How long before we are all working for the machines ?
Milo Tsukroff , Poughkeepsie , NY USA Urm..ok .
I am up for this .
Should be a laugh .
I am sure that this will affect the economy though .
At the moment I do not own a house - lets see where this goes .
Inquisitiveness is all about ' why ? '.
Russell , Plymouth THIS IS AMAZING - SIGN ME UP how do i offer my office time ?
i hate sitting at my desk and not contributing to the worldwide effectiveness of my second most time consuming office passtime .
- Surfing the interweb .
BRING IT ON .
Martin Davies , chorlton manchester
Yeah , labeling images on the web I 'm sure is sooo much more constuctive than building the Panama canal ... geeez !
Nuno , UK Brilliant idea !
After all , however complex a computer is ( and it is the most complex tool any of us ever use , I suppose ) , it is supposed to be working for us , the human beings , and not the other way round .
One consequence of the image labelling is likely to be rather subtle : depending on the language used , some things may end up being labelled in a quite different fashion than people might think .
I am thinking a little along the lines of international brand name problems and the like .
As for Matrix - that rubbish does not even deserve a mention !
D. Fear , Heidelberg , Germany HHEELLPP !!!!
This is such a problem that none of my family are able to self control the amount of hours spent playing computer games - either on - line or standalone .
I include myself in this .
The amount of discord and disassociation this causes is so damaging to our life .
If there is anything out there that allows control of how much time is spent on any programme in a day or week ?
Something that can't be disabled either .
It would certainly help us .
Sue , London , UK
Where can I play ?
luke strange , London I did n't find this simple activitiy to be compulsive at all .
I got bored after 10 seconds !
The geeks at Google have to try harder than this to get my time for free .
Bored , London
This game is just avoiding the waste of time from humanity .
I´ll never call this work for free , I shall say work for fun .
But I sure , I´ll never have fun playing this game .
Thankyou very much .
Vinicius De Nadai Andrade , Belo Horizonte / Brazil I know I 'll be up for this game .
30 % at work ( lunch break ) and 70 % at home .
Tagyal , London
Not much of a game is it ?
you type in as many words as you can and then find that your ' partner ' wants to pass on the image , so you 've wasted the past few minutes - at least yu can earn some cash amazon.coms ' ' mechanical turk ' .
There is no reward , and when the other party wimps out it 's literally pointless .
Graeme Mulvaney , Coventry , U I think its a brilliant idea from google and the Dr. However it does show how the internet can be easily used to manipulate people and a sence of injustice on a moral ground .p.s. i cant get the google link to work .
Sanjay , London Surely Dr. Ahn is going to be smitten by his own sword here ?
He invents the " captcha " as something that can only be done by humans , not computers .
Then he designs a game to get humans to do for free what computers can't do .
Has n't he just told people who want to bypass the protection provided by " captchas " exactly what they have to do ?
Yes , write a game to get people to decode the " captchas " for nothing .
Seems extraordinary to me .
Maybe he thinks that nobody would be willing to play such a game .
I would n't bet on it though .
Robert Ulph , London
The other unintended outcome of Capatch is the further segregation and separation of visually impared individuals whose screen readers are also unable to make sense of the system .
This renders a high proportion of visually impaired web users unable to register for sites and services which use this system .
Tom O'Dell , Congleton , UK Tried Google Image Labller after reading this .
I found the images are small and sometimes they are hard to see properly thereby making their descrption difficult .
Elaine , Northern Ireland Human - hours ?
Do n't you mean man-hours ?
Alan Tench , Middlesbrough , UK Are you Google 's gopher ?
No . I am not .
Because , I am too smart to be one .
Google is the Internet matrix and majority of humans on the net have been caught in the web of Googledom .
The bait is Google tickles the fancy of everyone online and before you know it you are hooked .
I do n't play games online .
In fact , I hate computer games .
I only use the Internet as the cheapest medium of mass communication and Google provides the raw stock for mass communication - information and as you know information is power .
And I am using Google as the vehicle for my Information , Education and Communication ( IEC ) for mass literacy .

This sounds interesting , although I find it bizarre that one of the reasons
Dr von
Ahn claims he is doing this is to help visually impaired users when the captcha is one of the biggest obstacles to computer use for many VI users ; as it insists on you writing down what you see before allowing you to send emails , ask queries , access a service etc , and it is purposefully designed not to be able to be understood by computer technology , the capcha entirely prevents blind people using screen readers from accessing many services .
It is very obstructive and very irritating !

It 's been six years since I 've done anything with this site , so I should probably do something about that .
Maybe in July .
Until then ( and even after then ) , you can go visit GoComics.com for new comics and all the ones that were n't posted here the past half a decade or so .
If you are so inclined , you can follow a practically neglected twitter account for Tiny .
For the few who visit this relic of websites past , thanks for dropping by .

In Greenpeace Apologizes For Apple Stink , I reported on Toxic Chemicals in Your Laptop Exposed , a new report which labored to find any trace of chemicals , toxic or not .
The report not only wholly contradicted the group 's earlier Guide to Greener Electronics , but its sensationalist press release also contradicted the data in the report itself !
Why is Greenpeace shooting in such random directions ?
The basic problems in the Guide , which I originally critiqued in Top Secret : Greenpeace Report Misleading and Incompetent , were sidestepped in a rebuttal from Tom Dowdall of Greenpeace International , but the followup laptop lab test report seemed to indicate a new direction for Greenpeace : an interest in accuracy .
Picking up the Pieces
Stephen Russell , a materials consultant to the IT sector , explained that the complete disconnect between what Greenpeace reported in their Guide and what they actually found in their lab tests “ proves three things :
• that the criteria used by Greenpeace to award HP pole position in last month 's Guide to Greener Electronics clearly did n't account for what is actually happening on the ground today .
• that other manufacturers ' computers really do n't contain toxic chemicals in concentrations that are of concern .
• that Greenpeace has an inexhaustible level of funds to burn on a chemical campaign the basic chemical principles of which they sadly do n't appear to understand . ”
Poison Apples ?
Unfortunately , Greenpeace ignored their own very expensive lab reports to instead retreat back into sensationalism , fear mongering , and deception .
The top story on Greenpeace International 's press release blog is an entry titled " HP and Apple 's toxic laptops exposed " which states :
" Some of the best - known laptops are contaminated with some of the worst toxic chemicals .
Of the five top brands we tested Hewlett - Packard and Apple laptops showed the worst contamination levels . "
After reporting that the testing found traces of chemicals in HP 's laptop which HP 's website " claims it removed from its products years ago , " the press release then jumps on Apple .
Under the headline Poison Apples , it claims :
" Apple has recently launched its new range of MacBooks , but what you also get with a new MacBook is the highest level of another type of toxic flame retardant , tetrabromobisphenol A. Apple claims it is looking for alternatives but for now it appears to be using far more of this toxic chemical than its competitors . "
The Apple and the Environment website does claim Apple " is actively researching materials with better environmental features to replace tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBA ) , " and that " Many Apple products have enclosures made of inherently flame retardant aluminum and polycarbonate plastic , reducing the need for added flame retardants . "
Under Attack
But is TBBA really one ' of the worst toxic chemicals , ' and is true that " Apple 's laptop shows the worst contamination levels ? "
Was Greenpeace lying in its press release ?
Yes , Greenpeace lied to sensationalize a report it spent a lot of money on , but which did n't provide data the group wanted to hear .
While the group ’s earlier press releases and information was mostly just incompetent and sloppy , the latest ‘ poison Apple ’ campaign was simply a malicious attack based upon lies .
Super Trooper
While making a big stink about TBBA and its supposed toxicity to create fear and panic , resulting in donations , Greenpeace ignored the opinion of the scientific community .
The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks ( SCHER ) reports it :
" agrees with the conclusion that there are no concerns for the carcinogenicity of tetrabromobisphenol A and supports conclusions ii ) for all exposure scenarios since the Margin of Safety ( MOS ) are very large .
Due to low systemic biovailability and efficient conjugation of the phenolic groups in tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA ) , bioaccumulation of this compound is not considered to be of concern . "
In EU Risk Assessments , a " conclusion ii ) " means that there is no need for further information or testing and no need for risk reduction measures .
That 's why TBBA is n't even regulated under the strict RoHS guidelines .
Greenpeace knows this , but this fact does not fit into their fear mongering campaign .
Mamma Mia
Greenpeace was criticized last year for mounting a ' hysterical , scaremongering ' campaign about dangerous chemicals in the environment by Prof.
Alan Boobis , a Professor of Biochemical Pharmacology and director of the Department of Health Toxicology Unit at Imperial College London .
In reality , TBBA is n't a toxic blob of ooze hiding inside laptops , but a rather a chemical applied to certain plastics as a fire barrier .
The nature of TBBA limits any credible risk to health :
" The plastics used in TV and computer housings are hard and dense so that substances used in their construction have little opportunity to be released .
[ Fire Retardants ] have essentially no tendency to move from the solid state into a gas form , and thus are unlikely to be released into the air around the computer or TV .
Monitoring studies have confirmed that TVs and computers are not significant emission sources . "
Kisses of Fire
Greenpeace is purposefully deceiving the public in an effort to gain notoriety and donations .
Not only is the group quick to lie about toxicity , but it also incompetently fails to account for why chemicals such as TBBA are in use in the first place .
The group 's flamboyant press release refers to TBBA is one of the " worst toxic chemicals , " but ignores the real safety issue that TBBA addresses : hundreds of deaths are prevented by flame retardants every year .
The Environmental Protection Agency 's Voluntary Children ’s Chemical Evaluation Program reports that " at a minimum , an estimated 280 deaths are avoided in the U.S. every year because of the use of brominated flame retardants . "
" Flame retardants can reduce the risk of death or injury in fires by preventing or delaying ignition , reducing the rate that fire releases heat , reducing the quantity of toxic gases produced , and increasing the time available to leave the burning building .
Studies have shown that flame retardants can increase the time available to escape a burning building by a factor of 15 . "
In trying to spread panic in subjects it fails to understand , Greenpeace ignores public safely issues in order to sound like an expert worthy of consumers ’ donations .
Name of the Game
Greenpeace wants your money , and it 's ready to say anything that will get you to hand it over .
Here 's a look at the response Greenpeace sent a member who asked the group about earlier criticisms of the Greener Guide to Electronics .
Note that Greenpeace has no problem with saying things that are not at all true .
He had three main thrusts to his argument ( that I could discern ) :
1. Greenpeace 's study is based on published claims about their practices , and not actual testing of their products .
My response :
The report was based largely on the companies stated policies .
Stated policies are critical to holding companies accountable for the environmental stewardship .
Apple has a very poor environmental policy when compared to other companies .
Simple enough .
2. Greenpeace has no credibility because of 2 events :
The Brent spar action OVER 10 YEARS AGO , and the Rainbow Warrior running aground on a reef due to inaccurate navigational charts .
My response :
These two events are in no way related to Greenpeace 's current credibility .
The Greenpeace toxics team is actually very well respected internationally both by professionals in the chemicals industry , and by policymakers in the United States , Europe , and those who work on international agreements .
Furthermore , all of our science is vetted through our Science Unit , which is based at the very respectable Exeter University in the UK .
3 . Apple is n't that bad because it does n't sell nearly as many computers , and therefore pollutes only a fraction of the larger computer makers ( such as HP ) .
My response :
This study was a qualitative assessment of one aspect of corporate environmental citizenship - not a quantitative assessment .
Macs make up less than 10 % of computers worldwide .
They should n't get a pass to produce some of the most toxic computers in the world simply because their production volume is relatively small .
They have the same ethical responsibility as all the other computer manufacturers .
Why You Should n't Support Greenpeace
The three ideas Greenpeace addressed are n't really the main points I wrote about , but it 's interesting Greenpeace chose them as examples .
In the first case , the Greenpeace Guide advertised a high ranking for HP , but their actual lab tests found that the HP laptop Greenpeace bought and tested did n't meet HP 's own goals and promises .
That means the Guide , which was heavily touted as a report card reflecting companies ' practices , not promises , was really just worthless ; two weeks later Greenpeace had to retract all the PR .
One can't really retract sensationalist PR .
Did consumers benefit from being told a simplistic story about HP being " a green leader " two weeks ago , and did Greenpeace send a useful message by ranking down HP in its report this week ?
Or did both simply serve to muddy the waters by ranking huge companies on a series of subjective criteria that did n't reflect their actual actions ?
In this email , Greenpeace claimed Apple " has a very poor environmental policy , " but he facts are that Apple is recognized as a leader in environmental policy by the Sierra Club , and that Greenpeace was unable to find any lapses in Apple 's products even after buying several in an attempt to have something to report .
After finding nothing of consequence , Greenpeace had to lie about their findings , and reported a negative spin about Apple that used clever word play , but was entirely deceiving .
The point : Greenpeace has no interest in presenting facts or reality in environmental issues .
They spend a lot of money pushing reports that are not only inaccurate , but intentionally misleading .
The second point , concerning my references to the Brent Spar controversy and Greenpeace destroying protected coral reefs in an attempt to " save " them , were presented as examples of how Greenpeace ( and anyone , really ) can do more damage than good despite good intentions .
I did n't present them as reasons Greenpeace had no credibility , but rather examples of Greenpeace being sloppy with planning and facts , and subsequently ignoring its own mistakes in retrospect rather than taking responsibility for its errors .
The most recent report , " Toxics in Your Laptop Exposed , " did credible scientific tests , but then threw out the data to instead present a lathered up , misleading and deceptive press release that was simply a lie .
No amount of credible science is worth anything if you ignore the findings and simply present the message you wanted to the data to support .
If Greenpeace had Al Gore buy an Apple laptop , and a panel of Nobel laureates perform sophisticated testing , it still would n't change anything if Greenpeace subsequently discarded their findings to present the same fear mongering report and press release it planned from the start .
Third , while I pointed out that Greenpeace failed to account for the size , volume , and product mix of the companies they ranked , I never stated that Apple should be given a free pass on environmental issues due to its size .
What I actually pointed out was that the " most toxic computers in the world " are actually made by low cost leaders , in particular HP and Dell , who strive to make $ 299 disposable PCs that can be marketed by WalMart or online as loss leaders .
These machines require CRT displays to reach that price target , making them hundreds of times more toxic and far more difficult to recycle properly .
The low end consumer market is also the least likely to recycle .
These are key facts Greenpeace ignored in its rebuttal and in its following reports .
If Greenpeace were at all interested in anything other than getting donations to maintain its status quo , it would challenge cheap PC dumpers on their efforts to shoot out disposable , garbage PCs that have a two year lifespan , not grandstand for the two biggest companies that produce the majority of the worlds cheap PCs while they vilify Apple .
In comparison , Apple makes PCs that are sold at a minimum price point that allows them to make sustainable machines that last longer .
Apple can afford to do this because it is making enough money on premium machines to avoid participating in the high volume , low quality majority market .
Why should anyone continue to fund Greenpeace in their efforts to badmouth companies that contribute a tiny fraction of the world 's PCs , while gushing about the promises ( not kept ) of the major PC makers , who contribute the most toxic and the vast majority of e-waste ?

The National Intelligence Estimate was completed in April but not made public .
Its conclusions , which were first reported by the New York Times , contradict assertions made by President George Bush and White House officials during the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks .
" It 's a very candid assessment , " said one official who has seen the report .
" It 's stating the obvious . "
The report , Trends in Global Terrorism : Implications for the United States , points out the " centrality " of the US invasion of Iraq in fomenting terrorist cells and attacks .
One section of the 30 - page report , Indicators of the Spread of the Global Jihadist Movement , describes how the American presence in Iraq has helped spread radical Islam by providing a focal point for anti-Americanism .
While arguing that there has been success in dismantling the leadership of al - Qaida and its ability to plan major operations , the report says that radical cells have moved to more than 5,000 websites to organise and spread their message .
The report 's tone contradicts recent optimistic assertions by the US administration .
It also furthers the divisions between the military and politicians in their assessment of the impact of US policy in Iraq .
In his speech to mark the fifth anniversary of the attacks of 9/11 , President Bush said : " The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power .
The safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad . "
But in a speech in April , thought to be largely based on the report , CIA chief General Michael Hayden , then deputy director of national intelligence , painted a more alarming picture .
" New jihadist networks and cells , sometimes united by little more than their anti-western agendas , are increasingly likely to emerge , " Gen Hayden said .
" If this trend continues , threats to the US at home and abroad will become more diverse and that could lead to increasing attacks worldwide . "
Democratic senator Edward Kennedy said in a statement that the report " should put the final nail in the coffin for President Bush 's phoney argument about the Iraq war .
How many more independent reports , how many more deaths , how much deeper into civil war will Iraq need to fall for the White House to wake up and change its strategy in Iraq ? "
But the White House said yesterday that press coverage of the intelligence report did not give the whole picture .
A spokesman said terrorist extremism " did not develop overnight " after the US invaded Iraq .
" Those seeds were planted decades ago , " he said .
" Instead of waiting while they plot and plan attacks to kill innocent Americans , the United States has taken the initiative to fight back . "
The Republican Senate leader , Bill Frist , said that while he had not seen the report , " we 've got to win this war on terror , wherever it is , and it 's going to be fought overseas , or if we do n't win there , it 's going to be fought here in the United States " .
The NIE report , the first formal assessment of global terrorism by US intelligence agencies since the invasion of Iraq , was started in 2004 under the leadership of David Low , an officer at the National Intelligence Council .
The council , under the auspices of the national intelligence director , John Negroponte , is made up of present and former intelligence officials .
It is charged with providing long - term assessments and analyses for the president and officials rather than policy prescriptions .
Its record , however , has been patchy .
A NIE report issued in 2002 concluded that Iraq had " continued its weapons of mass destruction programmes " , had biological and chemical weapons and " probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade " .
A July 2004 NIE report concluded that the possible outcomes in Iraq ranged from a government with tenuous control to civil war .
The report comes days after the House intelligence committee warned that Iraq had become a breeding ground for terrorists and that the danger facing the US was " more alarming than the threat that existed " before 9/11 .
The violence continued in Iraq over the weekend with 38 people killed in a suicide bombing in Sadr City on Saturday .
Twenty people were killed in violence around Iraq yesterday , as well as two US soldiers in the Anbar province west of Baghdad .
The confusion surrounding Saddam Hussein 's trial on genocide charges deepened yesterday when his defence team announced that it would boycott the trial indefinitely .
Five days after the judge in the case was unexpectedly removed , and four days after the new judge ejected the former Iraqi president from the court , Saddam 's lawyers said that the court had violated the law .
" The court committed several violations of the law and we will not just sit there gagged to give it legitimacy , " said Khalil al - Dulaimi , who heads the former president 's defence team .
He cited the court 's refusal to hear non-Iraqi lawyers in the case .
In their own words
" My administration , the Congress , and the United Nations saw the threat - and after 9/11 , Saddam 's regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take .
The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power "
George Bush 's address to the nation , September 11 2006
" I think it 's clear that we are safer but not really yet safe .
We 've done a lot ... our ports are more secure , we have a much stronger intelligence sharing operation .
We 've clearly hurt badly the al - Qaida organisation "
Condoleezza Rice , September 10 2006
" I do n't know how much better you can do than no attacks for the past five years .
The fact is , the world is better off today with Saddam Hussein out of power .
Think where we'd be if he was still there "
Dick Cheney , September 11 2006
1,600 years ago today , on December 31 , 406 , the Vandals invaded France .
Europe was going through a minor ice age .
The Rhine had frozen over .
Several Germanic tribes , the Vandals , Suebians , Alamannians , Alans and Burgundians , fleeing the Huns , crossed the river near Mainz and invaded Gaul .
Three years later , in 409 , the Vandals , Suebians and Alans crossed the Pyrenees .
The Suebians and a group of the Vandals ( the Asdings ) settled in Galicia .
The Alans and the rest of the Vandals ( the Silings ) moved on and settled in the south of Spain – a region which came to be called after them : Vandalucia ( later renamed al - Andalus by the Arabs ) .
The Vandals were Christians , though they belonged to the Arian sect which denies the divinity of Christ .
In 429 an army of 80,000 Vandals crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and invaded North Africa .
Ten years later they conquered Carthage .
Another 16 years later , in 455 , they crossed the Mediterranean and attacked Rome from the sea .
They sacked Rome in an orgy of violence that lasted two weeks and earned their reputation as “ vandals . ”
By 462 the Vandals ruled North Africa , the Balearic Islands , Corsica , Sardinia and Sicily .
In 468 they defeated a Byzantine ( Eastern Roman ) fleet , but from 477 onwards their power began to wane .
In 534 they surrendered to the Byzantines and North Africa returned to the Roman Empire until 648 , when it was overrun by the Arabs .
Some historians say that Islam was easily accepted by the Vandals because their Christian Arianism was compatible with it .
1,600 years ago today the Vandals invaded France .
Within a generation they had sacked Rome .
Where will Europe be 1,600 years from the other dates in this story : 2009 , 2029 , 2055 , 2062 , 2068 …?
Israel SarrÃ­o arrived at the Rehabilitation Center of Levante from Hospital Peset in Valencia ( Spain ) on January 31st of 2004 with an amputation of the left arm 2 inches above the elbow .
Click on images for large size
At 14:00hrs , the microsurgery implant began .
The first maneuver consisted in lavage and sterilization of the amputated arm and its connection to the brachial artery by a silicone tube in order to revascularize it .
Later we rebuilt the humerus and repaired the brachial artery , the basilic and cephalic veins , and the three nerves of the arm .
This proccess lasted 21 hours , and the reimplantation was successful .
The patient went to the Intensive Care Unit during that night and the next day , he went to a normal room .
Two days later , we found a wound infection that was seriously compromising the viability of the reimplantation .
We talked to the family and they told us that the day of the accident the arm fell in a drain .
This contamination was the probable cause of the unfavorable progress .
The situation was critical , and we said to the family that there were two different options : reamputate the arm or try to save it by taking it into a healthy zone where it would be possible to nourish it while we cleaned the infected area .
The idea of taking the arm to another anatomical location came by reading a similar case published by Michael Wood ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ) in which he attached an arm in the groin .
The uniqueness of our case consisted of using the procedure to rescue the limb from an infection , called a Deferred Transitory Heterotopic Implant .
This was the first such case of involving an elbow .
With the agreement of the family it was decided to transfer the arm to the groin where large blood vessels are readily accessible .
In 4 hours we disassembled the reconstruction performed earlier and connected the blood vessels of the arm to those of groin by means of microsurgery .
The psychological impact on the patient was very important .
As soon as he woke up , we told him that the arm was infected and we have to save it in other location on his body .
After a couple of hours he realized that the arm was on his leg .
He stayed that way for nine days with daily cleanings until it was verified that the stump was clean .
On February 12nd of 2004 , we reimplanted the arm in its original place , rebuilding bone , arteries , veins , nerves , muscles and skin in a procedure of 6 hours .
Afterwards , the patient was doing physically and psychologically well , happy that he have not have to lose his arm .
By this time the patient could move his elbow .
From the time of the surgery , the repaired nerve functionality is growing at a speed of 1 milimeter per day .
In about 6 months we hope that he will be able to move his hand and fingers .
The function which we hoped to obtain from this procedure was better than those obtained with an amputation and the prosthesis .
The patient will be able to grasp objects , to perform normal life functions , such as tie his shoes , all with small orthopedic aids .
The complete surgical team of the Unit of Hand and Reconstructive Surgery was involved in this operation , with Dr. Pedro Cavadas leading the team , and Dr. Navarro , Dr. Soler , Dr. Duke and Dr. Landin as assistants .
Notepad ++ is definitely my favorite Notepad replacement because of the extensive features that it has built - in .
A lot of applications are going to tabbed interfaces these days and Notepad ++ realized the importance of this early on , which is actually why I started using it in the first place .

“ Outsourcing ” is all the rage these days , in both senses : popular ( CEOs ) and fury ( union members ) .
Outsourcing is a constant process .
It is as basic to life as death is .
As the clock ticks , you can hear the outsourcing process .
You are its target .
Well , you were leaving anyway , right ?
In the early stages of any booming market , insourcing is all the rage .
Some industry gets hot .
In come lots of would - be replacements , all offering to do things cheaper , faster , better .
It does n’t matter what the field is : big money attracts people who want to get in on “ the gold rush . ”
Then the gold peters out .
There are a lot of miners out there , sifting pans in hand , with not much dust per dirt load .
The market for real estate brokers is now in the down side of its gold rush .
Because of the monetary policies Federal Reserve System after 1995 , a real estate boom took hold .
Millions of buyers took advantage of low long - term interest rates to bid up the price of home ownership .
Real estate brokers started doing better than people in other professions .
So , at the margin , newcomers arrived , trying to get a piece of the action .
Today , the bubble has reversed in some areas , such as Boston .
It is slowing down in the other boom areas .
Meanwhile , those businesses that are located in the middle of these boom regions find it increasingly expensive to recruit new employees .
The local cost of living is high because of appreciated real estate .
There are places to go where you can buy the lifestyle you want at a lower price .
There are even websites that let you identify such places .
Just type in a zip code .
Any company CEO who is n’t paying attention to such geographical options is costing investors and employees a lot of money .
SILICON VALLEY
Silicon Valley is the premier example .
In San Jose , the median priced home is now $ 700,000 .
Asking prices are higher than sale prices , but the price is still very high .
You can verify this on the following site , which reports the median price of housing in most major American cities .
With 5 % down and a mortgage rate of 6.3 % , a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage would require $ 4,000 a month .
To this add home insurance , taxes , maintenance , and the PMI ( under 20 % down ) extra payment .
Face it : the buyer will be paying $ 60,000 a year for his nondescript 3 - bedroom , 2 - bath stucco house .
Then taxes will rise .
Then maintenance costs .
What kind of salary scale is required to hire people who need $ 60,000 a year just to buy a mediocre home ?
The San Jose Mercury News ran a story on the job market in Silicon Valley .
It ’s an employer ’s market , even for highly skilled technicians .
Companies are outsourcing — hiring people outside of Silicon Valley .
Outsourcing to India is visible .
Outsourcing to North Dakota is n’t .
If you possess highly unique skills , you can get a job in Silicon Valley .
This is always true .
But your average grunt , with a Harvard MBA and a degree in engineering , is out of the running .
Jeri Ann Smith got laid off in August 2003 after 21 years at Hewlett - Packard .
Even with her experience , her MBA from Harvard and an engineering degree from the University of California - Los Angeles , Smith struggled to find a job in tech .
So Smith got a license to be an investment adviser and joined a firm her parents started .
“ It ’s wonderful not to have the threat of losing your job looming over you , ” Smith said .
“ I feel I have much more energy to tackle a new career here than I would at another tech company where the management could change and I ’d be left out again . ”
Yes , siree , Bob : just get a job from mom and dad , and job insecurity disappears . . . until mom and dad decide to retire .
Then there is the sad tale of Karl Troutman .
The former fiber - optic technician was laid off from Agilent in August 2003 .
Since then , Trautman , 62 , has done some contracting work , filled in as a maintenance worker and tried unsuccessfully to land a job .
“ I keep reading about how things are looking up , ” Trautman said .
“ But it ’s really deceptive .
It ’s not true . ”
While some valley employers are on a hiring spree , most of it is outside the region .
In 2005 , Intel hired 14,900 people .
Apple Computer added 3,105 .
Google snagged 2,659 .
EBay tagged 3,500 .
But these gains are offset by continuing cost - cutting and restructuring , as well as by valley companies hiring in other regions where the cost of living is cheaper .
According to payroll statistics from the state , Silicon Valley has only added a minimal number of jobs in the past year .
The other development is that the percentage of local jobs in high technology is declining .
Where is the job growth ?
At the lower end of the skill set .
Over the past five years , tech ’s share of jobs in San Mateo County has shrunk to only 26.3 percent after peaking at 31.6 percent in 2001 .
Other non -tech industries have been more robust , such as construction , which had a net gain of 2,200 jobs in the past year ; or restaurants , which expanded by 1,500 positions ; or education , which added 900 jobs .
So , here we have the general population sitting in high - priced housing .
New buyers must come from within the region : sellers of homes who are moving up .
But at the margin , few new buyers qualify for mortgage loans .
Outsiders are locked out .
The problem is , we all grow old .
Then , one by one , we move into very , very small quarters .
Utility costs drop .
Maintenance costs fall .
Everyone will eventually move out of the homes in Silicon Valley .
Who will be moving in ?
Those who got there early and bought their homes are paying enormous rents .
If they sold their homes , took and money , and invested — if nothing else , by issuing a mortgage to the buyers — they would be pulling in $ 4,000 a month .
They are not pulling in a dime .
They are paying high property taxes and maintenance costs .
They are maintaining their lifestyles in their ticky - tacky houses — the phrase coined by Malvina Reynolds in 1961 ( “ Little Boxes ” ) , a song that came to her as she was driving from Berkeley to Palo Alto .
Supposedly , it came to her in Daly City .
For those of you who do n’t remember it , it goes like this :
Little boxes on the hillside , Little boxes made of tickytacky Little boxes on the hillside , little boxes all the same .
There ’s a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one .
And they ’re all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same .
And the people in the houses all went to the university , Where they were put in boxes and they came out all the same .
And there ’s doctors and there ’s lawyers , and business executives .
And they ’re all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same .
And they all play on the golf course and drink their martinis dry , And they all have pretty children and the children go to school .
And the children go to summer camp and then to the university , Where they are put in boxes and they come out all the same .
And the boys go into business and marry and raise a family .
In boxes made of ticky tacky and they all look just the same .
Now they ’re 40 years older .
The people , I mean .
And so , one by one , they move to dramatically smaller quarters .
HEARTLAND AMERICA
Outsourcing is n’t just going to India .
It ’s going to heartland America , where it ’s humid and the breezes blow through in tall spirals at 160 miles per hour .
The most overpriced housing in the country , according to a recent study by a Ph.D. economist who lives in outrageously expensive Claremont , California , is San Mateo County , California — in between Silicon Valley and San Francisco .
He says there is no sign of a housing bubble anywhere else in the 10 major urban areas he studied .
( Yes , he says that . )
So , if you were planning to locate a high - tech company , where would you pick ?
You would look for a university that cranks out engineers and technicians , but one that is located in a low - cost area , where you can buy homes at depressed prices .
There is such an area .
Let me give you a hint .
It ’s located almost midway between North Zulch and Snook .
Got it placed mentally ?
It ’s College Station .
That ’s in Texas .
It ’s the home of Texas A&M .
In January , CNN rated College Station dead last out of 299 American cities in terms of underpriced housing .
Texas A&M cranks out lots and lots of engineers .
It ’s a conservative university politically , probably the most conservative university faculty in the United States .
There is a good old boy network in the state for A&M graduates , matched only by the old boy network of UT Austin grads .
There is money in Texas .
The town is not very lively , unlike Austin , so it attracts students who are content to study , go to football games , and drink , not necessarily in that order .
But the engineers are a studious bunch .
College Station is one of many similarly blessed college towns .
Students attend , learn to like the region , and would be willing to stay if they could get jobs .
They would be willing to work for less pay to buy lifestyle .
College Station is the obvious location for a high tech boom .
I saw what would happen in Austin in 1987 , when Texas real estate had crashed .
I told people that if I ran a company in Silicon Valley , I would re-locate to Austin .
Nearby , Round Rock became the home of Dell Computer .
There is no good reason why College Station could not become the next Austin as a high - tech center .
This would be stealth outsourcing .
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH
The technological best and brightest can live anywhere .
There are jobs for them .
They can buy those tick - tacky houses , though just barely .
But what kind of lifestyle can a person enjoy who is forced to pay $ 60,000 a year for 30 years , just to live in a nondescript house ?
This cannot go on , and it wo n’t go on .
The process of attrition will overwhelm any company that decides to locate in a former gold rush area whose real estate got bid up during the rush .
Teams are important in high - tech settings .
A team can live anywhere .
Core teams are kept close to the CEO .
Other teams are not crucial geographically .
Typical is Netflix .
It has 1500 employees , but only 300 of them are in Los Gatos , a Silicon Valley area .
The rest are scattered across the country .
The core technology team is in gold rush country .
The rest of the teams are n’t .
Start - up companies could open branch offices for recruiting purposes , located close to Stanford and Berkeley and the tech centers .
They could advertise like this :
Algorithm specialist wanted :
Sell your home for $ 700,000 Buy a $ 350,000 mansion in College Station , TexasPay cash for it .
No more mortgage debt .
Ever .
We ’ll pay you $ 100,000 a year .
When Google starts opening branches in places like College Station , investors will know that the company is serious about staying ahead of the pack .
Local teams can be assembled far from Silicon Valley .
Programmers will opt for lifestyle , just like everyone else .
If you can buy a better lifestyle for less money , pay lower taxes , and bear lower debt , why not make the move ?
India is one such outsourcing center .
It is not the only one .
There is no reason for any but the best and the brightest to stay on the core central team in Silicon Valley , New York City , Chicago , or Boston .
When investing , look for companies that have relocated or that are planning to .
These companies are not being run for the convenience of the CEO and his wife , who paid off their mortgage fifteen years ago .
Thirty - five years ago , I was hired by an outfit in Westchester County , New York .
Real estate was high .
I was a low - level employee competing against New York City stock brokers for housing .
The boss lived in a free home , had a free car and a free chauffeur , and never offered a raise .
He passed on most of his expenses to the organization , tax free .
I quit after a year and a half .
I could see that he was living his life for his convenience , not with any vision of how to replace an aging staff .
I knew he would run the organization into the ground .
He said he would : “ I will ride my bicycle until I fall off . ”
He did .
The man who replaced me — a “ kid ” in his forties — later confessed to me : “ If I had been sensible , I would have burned down that house . ”
The organization drifted into obscurity .
That free home seduced every subsequent CEO .
They could never hire bright , energetic types who might have kept the organization growing .
They would not offer wages that allowed young men a way to own their homes without massive debt .
They never felt the employees ’ pain .
Pretty soon , there were no high - level employees .
CONCLUSION
How is your company run ?
For the convenience of the CEO or the employees ?
If it ’s run for the convenience of the CEO and his immediate cronies , then your future is in danger .
They will suck the capital out of the company .
The most important capital is brainpower .
A wise CEO looks at the company ’s ability to hire better talent cheaper .
Today , the country ’s eyes are focused on India .
This is an optical illusion .
The significant outsourcing is domestic .
The Japanese auto producers did not build factories in Detroit .
They built them in Tennessee .
Detroit is going bust .
Tennessee , despite tornadoes , is n’t .
If you have a vision for your career that is hampered by your CEO and his wife , then you should consider outsourcing your employer .
Go to where the future is .
Go to where old people are retiring and young people are moving .
There is a phrase that describes such places : “ Newlyweds and almost deads . ”
Demographer Jack Lissinger has called them “ penturbia . ”
That ’s where the future is .

There is a denial of service vulnerability for Ruby applications that either use cgi.rb , or run on Mongrel or Litespeed .
This means that Rails is affected .
The fix is described below .
problem
Zed Shaw makes a full report here , explaining that :
… there has been an exploitable bug in the Ruby CGI library named cgi.rb , which allows anyone on the internet to send a single HTTP request to any Ruby program ( not just Mongrel ) using cgi.rb multipart parsing with a malformed MIME body that causes the Ruby process to go into a 99 % CPU infinite loop , killing it .
fix
The quickest fix is to update your mongrel version .
You have to use -- source , though , because 0.3.14 is n’t in the main repository yet :
sudo gem install mongrel -- source=http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/releases
Be warned .
This gem breaks relative paths in X - Sendfile headers with Apache 2.2 ( and possibly others ) .
Use File.expand_path ( ) to convert to absolute before you set the header .
more information
See the mailing list message for alternative fixes if you do n’t use mongrel or if upgrading the mongrel gem is not an option for you .
Thanks to cdcarter for the tip .

Luka Jovic darf Real Madrid offenbar verlassen .
Das berichtet die spanische Zeitung AS .
Demnach habe Trainer Zinédine Zidane den Daumen für eine Leihe gehoben .
Als mögliche Abnehmer gelten die AS Rom , Inter Mailand und der AC Mailand .
Auch Manchester United soll ein Kandidat sein , allerdings bevorzugen die Madrilenen eine Option , bei der Jovic regelmäßig spielen kann .
Auf die Frage , ob er Luka Jovic oder Borja Mayoral bevorzuge , sagte Zidane laut RealTotal am Dienstag : " Darauf werde ich nicht antworten .
Ich werde auf alle zählen , die im Kader stehen .
" Auf dem Transfermarkt könnte " bis zum 5 .
Oktober alles passieren .
Die Spieler sind hier , trainieren gut , das kümmert mich . "
Jovic machte bei Frankfurt auf sich aufmerksamBei Eintracht Frankfurt fiel der Name Jovic ebenfalls zuletzt lose im Umfeld .
" Wenn ein Spieler wie Luka Jovic gehandelt wird , dann würde man sich natürlich freuen , wenn er zurückkäme " , sagte Eintrachts Mittelfeldmann Stefan Ilsanker zuletzt .
Laut Sportdirektor Fredi Bobic ist an den Gerüchten aber nichts dran .
Werde Deutschlands Tippkönig !
Jetzt zum SPORT1 Tippspiel anmeldenUnter Adi Hütter wurde Jovic zu einem entscheidenden Baustein der Büffelherde mit Sébastien Haller und Ante Rebic , ehe er den Schritt zu Real Madrid wagte .
Stepanovic : Jovic muss Gas geben60 Millionen Euro war der Serbe Real 2019 wert , bisher ist das Engagement ein einziges Missverständnis .
In der laufenden Saison stand er immerhin beim 3:2 bei Real Betis in der Startelf und spielte 71 Minuten .
Zuvor gegen Real Sociedad blieb er ohne Einsatz .
In der vergangenen Saison absolvierte Jovic nur 17 Partien in La Liga ( 2 Tore ) .
" Ich würde ihm eine neue Herausforderung empfehlen .
Er muss richtig Gas geben , um es wieder nach oben zu schaffen " , sagt Dragoslav Stepanovic im Gespräch mit SPORT1 .
Die Trainerlegende der Eintracht pflegte früher einen engen Kontakt zu Jovic und trat in dessen zwei Jahren bei Eintracht Frankfurt häufiger als Dolmetscher auf .
Ruby Screen - Scraper in 60 Seconds
I often find myself trying to automate content extraction from a saved HTML file or a remote server .
I ’ve tried a number of approaches over the years , but the dynamic duo of Hpricot and Firebug blew me away - this is by far the fastest way to get what you want without compromising flexibility .
Hpricot is an extremely powerful ruby - based HTML parser , and Firebug is arguably the best on - the - fly development add - on for Firefox .
Now , I said it will take you about 60 seconds .
I lied , it should take less .
Let ’s get right to it .
Introducing open-uri
Ruby comes with a very flexible , production ready library that wraps all http / https connections into a single method call : open .
Among other things , open - uri will gracefully handle http redirects , allow you to specify custom headers , and even work with ftp addresses .
In other words , all the dirty work is already done , but you should still check the RDoc .
I ’ll let the code speak for itself :
require ' rubygems ' require ' open-uri ' @url = " http://www.igvita.com " @response = '' # open - uri RDoc : http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/index.html open ( @url , " User - Agent " => " Ruby / #{ RUBY_VERSION } " , " From " => " email@addr.com " , " Referer " => " http://www.igvita.com/ " ) { | f | puts " Fetched document : #{ f . base_uri } " puts " \t Content Type : #{ f . content_type }
" puts " \t Charset : #{ f . charset }
" puts " \t Content - Encoding : #{ f . content_encoding }
" puts " \t Last Modified : #{ f . last_modified }
" # Save the response body @response = f . read }
FireBug kung - foo
Now that we have the document , we need to pull out some content that interests us - usually , this is the tedious part based on regular expressions , stream parsers , etc .
Instead , we ’re going to sidestep all of these issues and let firebug do its magic .
First , install the extension , then while on this page , click in the bottom - right corner of your browser to bring it up .
It should ask you if you want to enable firebug ( hint : say yes ) .
You should now be greeted with the following screen :
For the sake of an example , assume that we want to extract three things out of this very page : some quoted text ( sample below ) , number of comments , and the list of my latest posts found at the bottom of this page .
Here is an example of quoted text :
So which came first , the parser , which will extract this , or this quote ?
- Extract me !
In your firebug window , click “ Inspect ” and hover your mouse over the quote .
You will notice that firebug navigates to the exact part of the DOM - tree ( HTML source code ) as you do this .
When you put your mouse over the quote , you should see the following :
Here ’s the trick , right click on the selected blockquote element in your firebug window and select Copy XPath .
This will provide you with the exact drill - down code for the DOM - Tree .
In our case your clipboard should contain : /html/body/div[2]/div/div/ blockquote .
Hpricot magic
It is at this point that Hpricot comes into the picture , and you have probably guessed it already - it supports XPath .
All we need to do is pass our HTML to it to build the internal tree , and then we ’re ready to go :
# Rdoc : http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ doc = Hpricot ( @response ) # Retrive number of comments # -
Hover your mouse over the ' X Comments ' heading at the end of this article # - Copy the XPath and confirm that it 's the same as shown below puts ( doc / " /html/body/div[ 3] /div/div/h2 " ) . inner_html #
Pull out first quote ( < blockquote > .... </ blockquote >) # -
Note that we do n't have to use the full XPath , we can simply search for all quotes # -
Because this function can return more than one element , we will only look at ' first ' puts ( doc / " blockquote / p " ) . first .
inner_html #
Pull out all other posted stories and date posted # -
This searh function will return multiple elements # -
We are going to print the date , and then print the article name beside it ( doc / " /html/body/div[4]/div/div[2]/ul/li/a/span " ) . each do | article | puts " #{ article .
inner_html } :: #{ article .
next_node .
to_s } " end
As you can see I provided a few other examples , but the idea is simple .
Open firebug , navigate to component you want to extract , copy XPath , paste it right into the search function of Hpricot and then print out the results .
How simple is that ?
I should also mention that Hpricot is not limited to XPath , nor did my examples cover all the functionality of it , I strongly encourage you to check the official Hpricot page for more tips and tricks .
Running our screen - scraper produces :
Fetched document : http://www.igvita.com/
Content Type : text / html Charset : utf - 8 Content - Encoding : Last Modified : No Comments
So which came first , the parser , which will extract this , or this quote ?
- Extract me !

今日は 、Ruby でWebサイトを解析するときに強い味方となるライブラリ、HpricotとWWW::Mechanizeを紹介します。
どちらも非常に強力なので、覚えておいて損はないよ！
以下ではま ずHpricotでHTMLを解析・編集する方法について解説します。 次に、「はてなダイアリーの自動更新」を例にWWW::Mechanizeの使い方を解説します。
Hpricot
HpricotはHTMLを解析するためのライブラリです。
例えば 「 あるページのリンクだけを全部抜き出したい」と思ったとき、どうしますか？scrAPIを使う？でもscrAPIはやっぱり ちょっと使いたいだけなのにパーザ( Scrape)用のクラスを定義するのが面倒なんだよね！
Hpricotなら、たったこれだけで解析完了です。
require ' hpricot ' require ' open-uri ' doc = Hpricot ( open ( " http://www.kmc.gr.jp/ " ) .read ) ( doc / :a ) . each do |link| puts " #{link.inner_html} → # {link [ : href ] } "
end
HTMLを読み込むに は「 Hpricot ( ) 」という関数 にHTMLデータの文字列を与えればOK。 例で はOpenURIを使ってネットから取得しています。
タグを検索するには、読み込んだデータの「/」というメソッドにシンボルか文字列を渡します。
table タグを全て探す doc /: table < div id =" hoge " >を全て探す doc / " div#hoge " < span class = " moge " > を全て探す doc /" span.moge "
CSS に慣れている人なら気付いたと思いますが、2番目、3番目の書き方は「CSSセレクタ」と呼ばれるものです。
Hpricotでは他にもさまざまなCSSセレクタを 使用することができます。
< table id =" list " > の中のtdタグを全て探す doc/" table #list td " " index.cgi ? " から始まるリンクを全て探す doc/" a[@href^='index.cgi ? ' ] " テキスト に" new " という文字列が入っているリンクを全て探す(※version 0.5以降 ) doc / " a[ text ( ) * =' new ' ] "
上の例はどれも 「〜なタグを全て探す」でしたが、条件に当てはまるものを一つだけ取り出したいこともありますよね。 そんな時はdoc.at( ) が使えます 。
一番最初のリンクを探す doc.at( :a)
Elements とElem
タグ一覧 はHpricot :: Elementsのインスタンスになります。これはArrayのサブクラスなので、 firstで最初の要素を取り出したり、eachでループを回したり、find_allで条件に合うものだけ抜き出したりできます。
またそれぞれのタグ はHpricot :: Elemのインスタンスになります。
Elemには以下のようなメソッドが定義されています。
attributes : 属性一覧
[ " href " ] : 属性hrefの値を得る
name : タグ名
parent : 親要素
containers : 子要 素( タグのみ )
children : 子要素( テキストやコメントも含む )
css_path : その要素のCSS パス
previous_sibling , next_sibling : 隣の要素( タグのみ )
previous_node , next_node : 隣の要素( テキストやコメントも含む )
each_child{|elem| ..} : 子要素について繰り返す
inner_html , inner_text : 内部 のHTML , 内部のテキスト
to_html : そのタグも含めたHTML
to_original_html : そのタグも含めたHTML(なるべく元のHTMLと同じように出力する)
to_plain_text : 読みやすいテキストに整形する
実はElem やElementsにも「/」や「at」が定義されているので、「/」による検索結果に対し「その中をさらに探す」なんてこともできます。
例：
divタグの中のリンクを全て探す doc/:div/:a 各divタグの中の最初のリンクを探す
( doc / : div ) . each do |div| first_link = div/:a end
HTMLに変更を加える
Hpricotの凄いところはHTMLへの変更もサポートしている点です。
linkをあるリンクタグだとすると、link.inner_html に文字列を代入すると中身のHTMLが変更されたり、 link [ : href ] = " foo.html " とするとリンク先 が" foo.html " になったりします。
これらの変更は、to_htmlなどが生成するHTMLに反映されます。 例えば「サーバ移転したのでexample.jpへのリンクをexample.orgに直したい」という場合は、
doc = Hpricot( ARGF.read ) ( doc / : a ) . each do | link| link [ : href ] .gsub ! %r( http://example.jp/), " http://example.org " end print doc.to_html
という感じで簡単にフィルタスクリプトを書くことができます。
変更系のメソッドには以下のようなものがあります。
[ " href " ] = : 属 性hrefの値をセットする
inner_html= : 内部のHTMLをセットする
name= : タグ名をセットする
children= : 子要素をセットする
余談
「/」とか個性的なメソッド名が多いHpricotですが、実は「もっと普通の名前」も用意されています。
例えば「/」には「search」という別名がありますし、 HTMLの読み込みは Hpricot.parse ( html ) とも書けます。 でもやっぱり短い方を使っちゃうんだよね…!( 便利だから )
WWW :: Mechanize
WWW :: Mechanizeは 、Webサイトへのアクセスを自動化するためのライブラリです。
例えばはてなダイアリーに日記を投稿するスクリプトを書くとしましょう。
Net::HTTPだとまず投稿用のURLを調べて、フォームタグの名前を調べてPOSTして、あれ認証ってどうやるんだっけ…？なんて
いろいろなことを考えないといけませんが、WWW::Mechanizeを使えば「普段ブラウザを操作するのと同じような感覚で 」 スクリプトを書くことができます。
では、ブラウザから日記を書くときの手順を思い出してみましょう。
WWW :: Mechanizeなら、これをそのままスクリプトに落とすことができます。
require ' mechanize ' require ' kconv ' #あと でUTF - 8 を扱うので agent = WWW ::Mechanize.new diary_page = agent.get ( " http://d.hatena.ne.jp/(自分のはてなid)/ " )
newでインスタンスを作って、getでWebページを取得しています。簡単ですね。
(2) おおっと、ログインしてなかった。右上の「ログイン」をクリックする
login_link = diary_page.links.text ( " ログイン " .toeuc ) login_page = agent.get(login_link.href )
diary_page.linksでページ中のリンク一覧が取得できます。ここでは、全てのリンクの中から
テキスト が" ログイン " に一致するものを探しています 。
login_link はMechanize :: Linkのインスタンスで、login_link.hrefでURLが得られます。agent.getにこのURLを渡してログインページを開きましょう。
(3) ユーザー名とパスワードを入力し、「 ログイン」を押す
login_form = login_page.forms.first login_form [ ' key ' ] = " ( ユーザ名 ) " login_form [ ' password ' ] = " ( パスワード ) " redirect_page = agent.submit(login_form )
login_page.formsでformタグの一覧が取得できます。ログインページにはformが一つしかないので、firstで最初のformを選んでいます。
次の行では、 < input name= " key " ...>
というインプットボックスにユーザ名を入力しています。
パスワードも同様に入力します。
agent.submitにこのフォームを渡すとフォームの内容が送信され、送信結果のページが返ってきます。
(4) 「 自動でページを移動しています(移動しないときはこちらのリンクを… ) 」
diary_link = redirect_page.links.text ( " こちら" .toutf8 ) diary_page = agent.get(diary_link.href )
ログインすると、おなじみの「移動しないときはこちらのリンクを…」というリダイレクトページになります。
WWW :: Mechanizeにはリダイレクトを自動で追跡してくれる機能がある…のですが、このリダイレクトページは200
OK なので 自動追跡が効きませ ん( ´・ω・｀ ) 仕方がないので、手動でリンクをクリックしましょう。
またこのページはさっきとちがってUTF-8なので、" こちら"
もUTF -8に変換しておきます。
(5) 「 日記を書く」をクリッ ク
edit_link = diary_page.links.text ( " 日記を書く " .toeuc ) edit_page = agent.get(edit_link.href )
ここまで来たらあと一歩です 。 " 日記を書く " のリンクを探し、クリックします。
( 6 ) textareaに日記本文を入力し、 「 この内容を登録する」を押す
edit_form = edit_page.forms.name( " edit " ) . first edit_form [ " body " ] += "
* Rubyから日記を更新してみるテスト。 " ok_button = edit_form.buttons.name( " edit " ) agent.submit( edit_form , ok_button )
さあ、いよいよ日記の書き込みです。編集画面には複数のフォームがあるので、edit_page.form(" edit " ) で最初の < form name = " edit " ...>
というタグを見つけています。また、このフォームには「確認する」と「登録する」という複数のsubmitボタンがあるので、 登録ボタンを探してsubmitに渡しています(「こっちのボタンを押してください」という意味です ) 。
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/(はてなid)/ を見てみてください。新しい日記が書き込まれましたか？:-)
WWW :: Mechanizeではこのように、ブラウザを操作するような感覚でスクリプトを書くことができます。
簡易リファレン ス
pageには以下のようなメソッドがあります。
links : リン ク(aタグ ) 一覧
forms : formタグ一覧
form ( " foo " ) : name = " foo " である最初のformタグ
title : ページタイトル( titleタグの中身 )
header : HTTP のレスポンスヘッダ
root : ページの内容を表すHpricotドキュメント
links やforms はMechanize :: Listのインスタンスを返します。これはArrayのサブクラスなので、配列のように扱うことができます。 また簡便のため、「hrefが"index.cgi" であるものを全て探す」という操作を links.href ( " index.cgi " ) のように書けたり、 「 name属性 が " hoge " であるものを全て探す」という操作を forms.name ( " hoge " ) と書けるようになっています 。
linkには以下のようなメソッドがあります。
href : リンク先のURL
text : aタグの中身のテキス ト
node : aタグを表 すHpricot:: Elem
click : リンクをクリックし、結果のページを返す ( newpage = agent.get ( link.href ) が、 newpage = link.
click のように書ける )
formには以下のようなメソッドがあります。
[ ]=( " foo " , " bar " ) : name = " foo " であるフィールドに 値" bar " をセットす る
submit : フォームをsubmitし、結果のページを返す ( newpage = agent.submit( form ) が、 newpage = form.submit のように書ける )
より詳細なリファレンス はWWW :: Mechanize 日本語リファレンスを参照してください。
インストー ル
さて、そろそろ実際に使ってみたくなったでしょうか？:-) rubygems をインストール済みなら、
gem install hpricot gem install mechanize
と、簡単なコマンドでインストールできます。
前述のとおりmechanizeはhpricotに依存しているので、 mechanizeを入れればhpricotは自動的に入ります。
Hpricotはつい最近version 0.5が出たので、昔インストールしたことがある人もアップデートをお勧めします。
Hpricotは途中 でUnix版を入れ る( ruby ) かWindows版を入れる( mswin32)か聞かれるので、自分の使っている方を選んでください。
rubygemsを使っていない人はアーカイブをダウンロードし、中に入っているinstall.rbを実行すればOKです(たぶん)
まとめ
本稿では 、Ruby でWebから情報を得るときに役立つ2つのライブラリ、HpricotとWWW::Mechanizeを紹介しました。
これらを使うことで、HTMLのスクレイプやWebアクセスの自動化など今まで「面倒そうだなぁ」と思っていた処理が非常に簡単に書けるようになります。
Webでの情報収集を自動化したくなったとき、この2つのライブラリのことを思い出してもらえれば幸いです。
色々な言語でライフゲーム
色々な言語でライフゲームを作ってみました。 ライフゲームについてはライフゲーム保存会 が詳しいです。また 、The Game of Life ですばらしい Java アプレットを遊ぶ事が出来ます 。
まず手始めに 、Squeak で原型を作りました 。Squeak は オブジェクト指向の元祖である Smalltalk の直系の子孫です。最近の言語はどれもオブジェクト指向の 影響を受けているので、まず Squeak で作ったら他にも移植しやすいだろうと思ったのです。 作りながら決めた仕様は以下のとおり 。
盤のサイズは 20 x 20
最初ランダムなパターンが現れる
0.2秒に一度世代交代
50 回世代交代をしたらまたランダムなパターンを生成
盤のクラス名は LifeMap
ただ 、Squeak 版以外は手を抜いてコマンドライン実行です。全部
Cygwin を使って作成しました。今後はマイナーな言語や歴史的な言語に手を広げたいと思っています。
Squeak
Life.st
Squak の文法は意外と癖がありません。ブラウザでプログラムを書いて行くので 見た目はかなり違和感ありますが、主語( オブジェクト ) 述語( メソッド ) : 対象( 引数 ) ..
という風に文章のように読んでいけて、オブジェクト指向なプログラムを大変素直に書く事が
出来ます。その他の特徴としては、型チェックが無いのでスーパークラスを気にせず、
メソッドの引数にどんなオブジェクトでも置けることです。
ただしそのオブジェクトがメソッドを持っていないと、
当然実行時にエラーが出ます。PerlやPHP、Javascript、Rubyと同じ仕組みです。 あと配列のインデックスが 1 から始まるのは最初ダサいと思うかも。
step " 次の世代を求める部分のコード ( LifeMap クラス ) " | prev | prev _ self copy .
1 to : self width do : [ :x | 1 to : self height do : [ :y | self at : x @ y put : ( ( self at : x @ y ) next When : ( prev num At : x @ y ) ) ] ]
Perl
perlLife.txt
強力なテキスト処理で知られる Perl ですが、今回テキスト処理は 無しです 。Perl のオブジェクト指向機能は強引だと良く言われますが、それはインスタンス変数が実はハッシュだとか オブジェクト指向を実現する仕組みがマルミエだからで、僕は慣れたので気になりません。ただ確かに冗長。 宣言なしで配列が勝手に伸たり、変数名を省略できたり便利な機能が山盛りなのですが、ちょっと 他の言語にかまけて久しぶりに触るとそういう小技を忘れてて結構きついです。
このプログラムはコンソールから実行して遊んでください。cygwin で作ってますが、linux 等でも動くと思います。 一番簡単な方法は
$ wget - O - http://metatoys.org/propella/lifeGame/perlLife.txt | perl
# 次の世代を求める sub step { my $ self = shift ; my $ newMap = [ ] ; foreach my $y ( 0 .. $ self ->{ _height} - 1 ) { foreach my $ x ( 0 .. $ self ->{_width} - 1 ) { $ newMap ->[ $x ] [ $y ] = $ self->_nextWhen ( $self ->{_map} ->[ $x ] [ $y ] , $ self -> _num At ( $x , $ y ) ) ; } } $ self -> {_map} = $ newMap ; }
Scheme
schemeLife.scm
scheme の中でも最近ハヤリ のGaucheでライフゲームを書いてみました。遊び方は
Perl 版と同じで、コマンドラインから実行してください。 lisp 系の特徴として、データの表現にリストという物を良くつかいます。これはツリー状にデータをイモヅル式に くっつけた物です。効率の面から配列と比較すると、配列はアクセスや更新が早いが挿入が 面倒、リストはその逆という事が言えます。もう一つ lisp 系は関数型言語と呼ばれますが、これは 末尾再帰等の機能を上手く使って代入なしのプログラムが書けるのが特徴で、このライフゲームもリストと 再帰を使い、代入を全く使っていません。こんな短いプログラムじゃ分かりませんが、デバッグが簡単になるそうです。
scheme が lisp とどう違うのかという部分ですが、僕は lisp は知らないのですが、どうも 無名サブルーチンをレキシカルスコープの変数に入れ、その変数を関数名として使うと言うのが scheme っぽいらしいです 。
Perl を知ってる人は、無名サブルーチンと my 変数しか無い世界を想像したら良いと思います 。
; 次の世代を求める ( define life - map - step ( lambda ( board ) ( let next - rows ( ( board - framed ( life - map - framed board ) ) ) ( if ( null ? ( cddr board - framed ) ) ( ) ( cons ( life - map - step - cols ( car board - framed ) ( cadr board - framed ) ( caddr board - framed ) ) ( next - rows ( cdr board - framed ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define life - map - step - cols ( lambda ( top mid bot ) ( if ( null ? ( cddr top ) ) ( ) ( cons ( life - map - next - when ( car top ) ( cadr top ) ( caddr top ) ( car mid ) ( cadr mid ) ( caddr mid ) ( car bot ) ( cadr bot ) ( caddr bot ) ) ( life - map - step - cols ( cdr top ) ( cdr mid ) ( cdr bot ) ) ) ) ) )
Ruby

様々な言語の良いとこ取りをしたと言われる Ruby ですが、ライフゲーム は
Perl 版とほとんど同じ 感覚で書く事が出来ました。メタクラスの存在やクラス名がグローバル変数な所、メソッドがシンボルな所が
Smalltalk の影響を感じます。変わった機能としてはイテレータがあり、これは
Perl で言う所の クロージャ渡し 、Smalltalk のブロック渡しでしょうか。慣用句としては非常に面白いのですが、 yield という新たなキーワードが必要だったりするので、ちょっと戸惑いました。
# 次の世代を求める def step newBoard = newBoard ( width , height ) ( 0 ... width ) . each do |x| ( 0 ... height ) . each do |y| newBoard [ x ] [ y ] = nextWhen ( @board [ x ] [y ] , numAt ( x , y ) ) end end @board = newBoard end
Prolog
prologLife.txt
僕が子供の頃に流行っていた Prolog です。色々なプログラム言語がありますが、 これが一番変わってます。他の言語の常識がことごとく通用しませんので、逆に 知らず知らずのうちに当たり前と思っていた事が、当たり前じゃない世界があるんだと めちゃくちゃ新鮮な気分にさせられます。実はこのページを作ろうと思ったきっかけは、 こんな変な言語で本当にプログラムが書けるのだろうかと思い、Prolog と 他の言語を比較したかった事なのです 。
メジャーな言語の実行単位は関数(何かを与えると何かが返るしくみ)か命令の どちらかが多いですが 、Prolog の場合は述語という物を使います。これは見た目が関数に 似ていて、、実は全然違います。一応述語にも値があって、真か偽のどちらかを 持つのですが
、Prolog プログラムの流れは述語の値を求めるのではなく、もしも 述語が真であるとしたら、その条件は何だろう ?
としらみ潰しに探しまくる事です。 プログラムを書く時に一番頭の切り替えが必要だったのが、述語は関数では無いので
値を返さないという事です。値が必要な場合は参照渡しのように引数の部分に 記述します。
他の言語に無い便利な機能としては、パターンマッチングがあります。これは
文字列マッチングのことではなく、述語に渡された値によってどの定義を実行するの
かと言う事を分かりやすくソースに書ける機能です。haskell 等関数型言語にはあるのですが、 再帰の終了条件で使うと美しく、プログラムがすっきりするので、他の言語も採用すれば良いのに！
開発には SWI - Prolog ( Version 5.1.5 ) を Cygwin でコンパイルして使いました。最初バイナリ版を使ってたのですが、readline が使える Cygwin 上の方が全然使いやすいです。こ の
Prolog はオリジナル のGUI ライブラリ も付属していて相当強力な雰囲気です。いずれ GUI にも挑戦したい 。
% 次の世代を求める lifeMapStep :- retractall ( newBoard(_ , _ ) ) , lifeMapScan( lifeMapStep , true ) , retractall ( board ( _ , _ ) ) , lifeMapCopy . lifeMapStep (X , Y ) :- numAt ( Sum , X , Y ) , next When ( Sum , X , Y ) , assert ( newBoard ( X , Y ) ) , !. lifeMapStep(_ , _ ) .

So , you know those cars with that keyless entry pad ?
The one under the driver 's side handle ?
Well , if you look closely you will see that there are really only 5 buttons , labeled " 1/2 " , " 3/4 " , " 5/6 " , " 7/8 " , " 9/0 " .
In an effort to avoid a little confusion , I 'm going to call those buttons 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 , respectively .
A little experimentation will reveal that , if the code is 11357 , and you type 5113579 , the door will still open !
This means that with 7 characters we managed to try out 3 sequences - 51135 , 11357 , and 13579 .
After the inital 4 numbers ( which sort of primed the pump ) every digit tries one new sequence .
Since there are 5 5 length 5 sequences of characters from an alphabet of size 5 , we know that we 'll need to try 3125 sequences total .
With our intuition from above , we would hope that we could find a sequence of size 4 + 3125 ( priming the pump , followed by one new sequence every keypress ) .
It turns out that a mathematician named de Bruijn has already done all of the hard work for us on this one , and all of the relevant math can found under the names de Bruijn sequence and de Bruijn graph .
But I 'm not going to talk about math any further here .
Right now , I am going to give you a sequence of minimal length that , when you enter it into a car 's numeric keypad , is guaranteed to unlock the doors of said car .
It is exactly 3129 keypresses long , which should take you around 20 minutes to go through .

HOW BRAINS THINK expands on my October 1994 Scientific American article to address the evolution of consciousness , intelligence , and language .
The parallel 1996 book is The Cerebral Code from MIT Press ; though not as well suited for the general reader as the present book , those interested in the neural circuitry of the brain needed to run a darwinian process may wish to look at The Cerebral Code if Chapters 6 and 7 of the present book arent enough .
Here 's the excerpt that appeared at HMS Beagle .
This is n't an IQ book ; I 'd recommend Earl Hunt 's article " The role of intelligence in modern society . "
HOW BRAINS THINK was on both the London and the Washington DC science bestseller lists of New Scientist ( May 1997 ) .
At Amazon.com , it was # 29 of 100 Bestsellers for 1996 .

Reviews of HOW BRAINS THINK : " [ HOW BRAINS THINK ] , part of the Science Masters series , offers an exquisite distillation of his key ideas .
He 's a member of that rare breed of scientists who can translate the arcana of their fields into lay language , and he 's one of the best .
There are other , competing theories for explaining consciousness .
But Mr. Calvin , so lyrical and imaginative in his presentation , draws you into his world of neural Darwinism and inspires you to read more . "
Marcia Bartusiak , in -- , in New York Times Book Review , November 17 , 1996 " Nothing in showbiz right now is as thrilling as the debate surrounding consciousness .
Darwinism decentred the body .

We might do worse than start with with a report from the BBC .
They covered a talk at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco this last week .
( I did n't get to go , alas ) .
I 've been trying this week to get a grip on the science of the Greenland Ice Sheet .
It 's a complex and poorly understood business , but there seems to be enough meat here that I think it should be on The Oil Drum agenda .
Greenland
First , some basic statistics .
The CIA reports that Greenland has an area of 2.2 million km2 -- slightly more than three times the size of Texas -- and a population of 56,375 humans .
Greenland is a self - governing colony of Denmark .
A " flat to gradually sloping icecap covers all but a narrow , mountainous , barren , rocky coast " .
The ice sheet covers about 80 % of the land , and contains about 2.5 million cubic kilometers of ice .
If all that ice were to melt , it would increase global sea level by about 7 m , or 23 feet .
Until very recently , climatologists thought that , although global warming might melt the icesheet eventually , it would be very unlikely to occur on any timescale that we would care about .
As the 2001 IPCC report , Climate Change 2001 : The Scientific Basis , put the issue :
For Greenland , estimates of the sensitivity to a 1 °C local warming over the ice sheet are close to 0.3 mm / yr ( with a total range of +0.1 to +0.4 mm / yr ) of global sea level equivalent .
Given warming of a few degrees over Greenland , that 's at most a few tens of centimeters of sea level rise due to Greenland ice between now and 2100 .
That can't be too bad , right ?
However , the studies on which this estimate was based assumed that the main things going on with the dynamics of the ice sheet are :
Snow falls on it and makes it thicker .
In the summer , the top melts , the water runs away , and the sheet gets thinner .
The ice flows a little faster or slower depending on the thickness of the sheet .
It 's now starting to look like this misses the most important physics .
An interesting paper by Zwally et al appeared in Science in 2002 ( you can get most Science papers over 12 months old with just a free registration ) .
They monitored the location of a pole stuck in the surface of the ice sheet with a GPS monitor stuck on it over several years .
What they discovered is that the pole moved at a fixed steady pace in the winter , but in the summer , there were sudden anomalies were the pole started to move faster , which would then stop again later in the summer .
Here 's Figure 3 of the paper , with it 's original caption :
Figure 3 . ( A ) Horizontal ice velocity ( red curve ) along a smoothed line of motion showing ice accelerations during the summer melt seasons and the abrupt transitions to deceleration around the times of melt cessation .
The cumulative additional motion ( horizontal residual , black ) relative to a wintertime - average velocity of 31.33 cm / day is 6.0 m by the time of the maximum velocity in 1999 .
( B ) The vertical residual ( blue ) indicates a 50 - cm uplift at the time of the 1997 transition from accelerating flow to decelerating flow .
( C ) Cumulative PDDs and PDDs for 10 - day intervals ( 10d DD , red ) from temperatures measured at the Swiss Camp , showing correlations of the melting with the intensity and timing of the ice accelerations and decelerations ( units are degree - days ) .
Vertical dotted lines mark May 1 , July 1 , and September 1 for each year .
The picture that emerges is that in the summer , the top of the icesheet starts to melt , this water heads down various vertical channels ( moulins ) and crevasses , and ends up lubricating the motion of the ice sheet at the bottom , where it grinds against rock .
Now , the amount of motion in the Zwally paper is quite small ( 32 cm / day increasing to 40 cm per day ) , but what is striking is that the effect seems to turn on from almost nothing in less warm years to quite pronounced in warmer years , leading one to wonder how the effect might scale in the future with yet more warmth .
Someone who 's been worrying about that a lot is James Hansen , director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
In a series of papers ( with collaborators ) in Scientific American , in Climatic Change , and in Science , he lays out his concerns .
The first thing that needs to be understood is that climate change has been extremely rapid in the past .
Recent results from Antarctic ice cores further extend the idea that temperature and composition of key global warming gases vary rapidly at times in the past .
This graph covers the last 650,000 years with seven major glaciations in ( times when ice sheets cover much of North America and Europe ) .

Note in particular that ice ages typicallyvery sharply - eg the most recent one ending 20,000 years ago ( the figure is plotted with time going backwards to the right ) .
Now it turns out that this also translates into the ice sheets melting rapidly and sea level rising rapidly .
Sea level rise since the last glacial maximum .

Over the full 10000 years or so after the icesheets of the last ice age became unstable and started to melt , sea level rose about 120 m - a rate of around 1.2m / century .
Obviously in the Holocene ( the flat sea - level plateau since 8000 years ago ) , things have been remarkably stable , and it is in that period that humans have built civilization .
The remaining Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have clearly been stable at Holocene temperatures .
The maximum rate of change during the deglaciation occurred during Meltwater Pulse 1A ( about 14000 years ago ) and was around 5 m / century .
There is controversy over whether this pulse is primarily due to melting of the ice sheets in North America , or portions of those in Antarctica .
However , either way it's an indication that when big ice sheets go , they can go with a rush .
And this is where the worry about Greenland comes in .
As Hansen puts it :
The dominant issue in global warming , in my opinion , is sea - level change and the question of how fast ice sheets can disintegrate .
A large portion of the world 's people live within a few meters of sea level , with trillions of dollars of infrastructure .
The need to preserve global coastlines sets a low ceiling on the level of global warming that would constitute dangerous anthropogenic interference .
The history of the earth and the present human - made planetary energy imbalance together paint a disturbing picture about prospects for sea - level change .
Data from the Antartic temperature record show that the warming of the past 50 years has taken global temperature back to approximately the peak for the current interglacial ( the Holocene ) .
The is some additional warming in the pipeline that will take us about halfway to the highest global termperature level of the previous interglacial ( the Eemian ) , which was warmer than the Holocene , with sea level estimated to have been five to six meters higher .
One additional watter per square meter of forcing , over and above that today , will take global temperature approximately to the maximum level of the Eemian .
The main issue is :
How fast will ice sheets respond to global warming ?
Given the present unusual global warming rate on an already warm planet , we can anticipate that areas with summer melt and rain will expand over larger ares of Greenland and fringes of Antarctica .
Rising seal level itself tends to lift marine ice shelves that buttress land ice , unhinging them from anchor points .
As ice shelves break up , this accelerates movement of land to the ocean .
Although building of glaciers is slow , once an ice sheet begins to collapes , its demise can be spectacularly rapid .
Since Hansen wrote those words , it has now been tentatively reported from satellite measurements that the net mass loss of Greenland Ice recently is as follows .
Estimated ice mass loss from Greenland in cubic kilometers .

This is the quantitative story behind the BBC report that we began with .
Now , compared to the total amount of ice on Greenland -- 2.5 million cubic kilometers -- these are still very small numbers .
On the other hand , the volume appears to be growing super - exponentially ( ie the doubling time is reducing as we go ) .
If that continues , it wo n't take many decades for the mass - loss to reach a volume that really matters .
On the third hand , you can extrapolate three points just about any way you want .
There certainly is not scientific certainty that Greenland will melt to an important degree in the twenty - first century .
But at this point , scientists are no longer ruling it out , either .
For perspective , here 's an EPA map of the portions of the US east coast that would be inundated by 1.5 m and 3.5 m of sea level rise .
3.5 m would be reached halfway through a Greenland icesheet collapse .
As you can see , the total area is n't that large , but it includes a pretty large fraction of many of the east coast 's coastal cities .
That would be expensive .

Perhaps the greatest danger is the time lags in the system .
There are the time lags in the climate itself - because the ocean is very slow to warm up , the earth still has not reached equilibrium with the greenhouses gases we already have put into the atmosphere .
Inbound sunlight is exceeding radiation to space by 0.85+-0.15 W/m .
The earth probaby has around 0.6 degrees centigrade ( roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit ) of additional warming just to catch up with what we 've already done .
But perhaps more importantly , this level of imbalance is believed to be far greater than what drove deglaciations after ice ages in the past .
That raises the fear that ice sheets could collapse faster than ice sheets in the past too .
Then there 's the time for humanity to swap out it 's fossil fuel economy and replace it with whatever we would do instead , which has to be decades at minimum .
The big risk is that we will set in motion something unstoppable before we see overwhelmingly clear evidence of it .
At any rate , what is clear is that the Greenland icesheet melting very urgently needs to be understood .
In particular in contemplating tar - sands , coal - to - liquids , etc , as solutions to peak oil , we need to understand what gamble with the ice sheet we are making , exactly .
Over most of the country and in all but a few major metropolitan areas , corporal punishment has been on a gradual but steady decline since the 1970’s , and 28 states have banned it .
But the practice remains alive , particularly in rural parts of the South and the lower Midwest , where it is not only legal , but also widely practiced .
In a handful of districts , like the one here in Everman , there have been recent moves to reinstate it , some successful , more not .
In Delaware , a bill to rescind that state ’s ban on paddling never got through the legislature .
But in Pike County , Ohio , corporal punishment was reinstated last year .
And in southeast Mississippi , the Laurel school board voted in August to reinstate a corporal punishment policy , passing one that bars men from paddling women , but does not require parental consent , as many other policies do .
The most recent federal statistics show that during the 2002 - 3 school year , more than 300,000 American schoolchildren were disciplined with corporal punishment , usually one or more blows with a thick wooden paddle .
Sometimes holes were cut in the paddle to make the beating more painful .
Of those students , 70 percent were in five Southern states : Texas , Mississippi , Tennessee , Alabama and Arkansas .
Often the battle over corporal punishment is being fought on the edges of Southern cities , where suburban growth pushes newcomers from across the country into rural and religiously conservative communities .
In these areas , educators say , corporal punishment is far more accepted , resulting in clashing attitudes about child - rearing and using the rod .
“ I could n’t believe it when I learned about it , ” said Peggy Dean , a mother of three students in Union County , N.C. , a rapidly growing suburb south of Charlotte .
“ If I ’d known , I ’d never have moved into this school district . ”
Experimental studies conducted by Ph.D. Anatoli Bogdan at the University of Helsinki , Finland , have received broad interest in the scientific world , as the results might have applications even in the cryopreservation of cells and tissues .
Bogdan ’s results show that mixture droplets consisting of sulphuric acid and water can be slowly cooled down to - 140 degrees Celsius and then heated again without ice formation .
The formation of ice is particularly problematic in cryopreservation , as the crystal formation damages cell structures .
Bogdan has conducted his experiments by cooling and heating droplets of 0.5 - 6 µm in diameter .
His study focuses on two forms of water : low - density amorphous ice ( LDA , or so - called glassy water ) and highly viscous water ( HVW ) , which is a liquid phase that LDA melts into .
Bogdan reports that HVW is not a new form of water as some scientists believed .
Bogdan ’s study Reversible Formation of Glassy Water in Slowly cooling Diluted Drops has been published in Journal of Physical Chemistry in June 2006 .
Bogdan himself applies his observations on the properties of water in cloud research , and he and his colleagues have recently published a study dealing with cirrus clouds ( Formation of Low - Temperature Cirrus from H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O Aerosol Droplets , Journal of Physical Chemistry , November 2006 ) .
Their study suggests that , unlike previously thought , the cloud crystals in cirrus clouds are not completely solid ice , but are covered with a layer of liquid water and sulphuric acid .
The layer effects for instance the reflectivity of the clouds , and therefore the climate .
It has also been observed that the rate of ozone loss is higher on liquid than on solid surfaces .
The results therefore indicate that the ozone is destroyed in the cirrus clouds faster than conventionally has been thought .

( Correction : Because of an editing error , a story in yesterday 's Business section about an anti-sniper system developed by iRobot misidentified the date on which the company unveiled the system .
It was demonstrated by iRobot on Monday at a convention of the Association of the United States Army in Washington . )
IRobot Corp. of Burlington , famous for its robotic vacuum cleaners , has teamed up with researchers at Boston University to develop a military robot capable of spotting enemy snipers .
'' You 'll actually see the sniper before the smoke disappears from the shot , " said Joe Dyer , iRobot 's executive vice president and general manager .
IRobot demonstrated the system , called REDOWL ( for Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost with Lasers ) , at the Association of the United States Army convention in Washington yesterday .
Testers struck pieces of metal to simulate gunshots .
REDOWL quickly aimed its infrared camera and laser rangefinder at the source of the noise , just as it did in tests at a Medfield gun range .
REDOWL is based on iRobot 's PackBot , a battery - powered lightweight robot already in active service with the armed forces .
PackBots are used to explore dangerous terrain or enter buildings to search for booby traps .
Glenn Thoren , deputy director of the Boston University Photonics Center , wondered if an antisniper system could be mounted atop a PackBot .
He used laser rangefinder gear from Insight Technology Inc. in Londonderry , N.H. , and sound - detection equipment developed by BioMimetic Systems , an acoustics start - up company founded by Boston University .
The REDOWL also includes a Sony digital camera that can zoom in on distant objects or people , and display infrared images at night .
When REDOWL 's microphones detect a gunshot , the device calculates the source of the sound , swivels the camera , illuminates the target with either visible or infrared light , and uses a laser to calculate the range .
Yet the entire system adds only about 5.5 pounds to the PackBot 's weight .
Thoren said it 's small enough to mount on military vehicles or on the sides of buildings .
That makes it much smaller than Boomerang , a competing antisniper technology being developed for the military by BBN Technologies Inc. in Cambridge .
Dyer said that in tests , the REDOWL detected gunfire sources with 94 percent accuracy , and can distinguish between guns .
'' It can tell the difference between a 9 millimeter pistol and an AK - 47 or an M - 16 , " he said .
The machine also works in urban settings , where snipers are hard to spot because gunshot sounds echo off buildings .
Dyer said REDOWL 's software can detect the original sound source and ignore the echoes .
In theory , a REDOWL system could fire back at an enemy , but Thoren said the hardware is n't strong enough to support the weight of a gun .
Besides , he said , it would be dangerous to have a weapon - toting robot that could open fire on its own .
'' You need to have a man in the loop , " he said .

China , India and other developing countries are set to give the world economy its biggest boost in the whole of history , says Pam Woodall ( interviewed here ) .
What will that mean for today 's rich countries ?
LAST year the combined output of emerging economies reached an important milestone : it accounted for more than half of total world GDP ( measured at purchasing - power parity ) .
This means that the rich countries no longer dominate the global economy .
The developing countries also have a far greater influence on the performance of the rich economies than is generally realised .
Emerging economies are driving global growth and having a big impact on developed countries ' inflation , interest rates , wages and profits .
As these newcomers become more integrated into the global economy and their incomes catch up with the rich countries , they will provide the biggest boost to the world economy since the industrial revolution .
Indeed , it is likely to be the biggest stimulus in history , because the industrial revolution fully involved only one - third of the world 's population .
By contrast , this new revolution covers most of the globe , so the economic gains — as well as the adjustment pains — will be far bigger .
As developing countries and the former Soviet block have embraced market - friendly economic reforms and opened their borders to trade and investment , more countries are industrialising and participating in the global economy than ever before .
This survey will map out the many ways in which these economic newcomers are affecting the developed world .
As it happens , their influence helps to explain a whole host of puzzling economic developments , such as the record share of profits in national income , sluggish growth in real wages , high oil prices alongside low inflation , low global interest rates and America 's vast current - account deficit .
Emerging countries are looming larger in the world economy by a wide range of measures ( see chart 1 ) .
Their share of world exports has jumped to 43 % , from 20 % in 1970 .
They consume over half of the world 's energy and have accounted for four - fifths of the growth in oil demand in the past five years .
They also hold 70 % of the world 's foreign - exchange reserves .
Of course there is more than one respectable way of doing the sums .
So although measured at purchasing - power parity ( which takes account of lower prices in poorer countries ) the emerging economies now make up over half of world GDP , at market exchange rates their share is still less than 30 % .
But even at market exchange rates , they accounted for well over half of the increase in global output last year .
And this is not just about China and India : those two together made up less than one - quarter of the total increase in emerging economies 'GDP last year .
There is also more than one definition of emerging countries , depending on who does the defining ( see article ) .
Perhaps some of these countries should be called re-emerging economies , because they are regaining their former eminence .
Until the late 19th century , China and India were the world 's two biggest economies .
Before the steam engine and the power loom gave Britain its industrial lead , today 's emerging economies dominated world output .
Estimates by Angus Maddison , an economic historian , suggest that in the 18 centuries up to 1820 these economies produced , on average , 80 % of world GDP ( see chart 2 ) .
But they were left behind by Europe 's technological revolution and the first wave of globalisation .
By 1950 their share had fallen to 40 % .
Now they are on the rebound .
In the past five years , their annual growth has averaged almost 7 % , its fastest pace in recorded history and well above the 2.3 % growth in rich economies .
The International Monetary Fund forecasts that in the next five years emerging economies will grow at an average of 6.8 % a year , whereas the developed economies will notch up only 2.7 % .
If both groups continued in this way , in 20 years ' time emerging economies would account for two - thirds of global output ( at purchasing - power parity ) .
Extrapolation is always risky , but there seems every chance that the relative weight of the new pretenders will rise .
Faster growth spreading more widely across the globe makes a huge difference to global growth rates .
Since 2000 , world GDP per head has grown by an average of 3.2 % a year , thanks to the acceleration in emerging economies .
That would beat the 2.9 % annual growth during the golden age of 1950 - 73 , when Europe and Japan were rebuilding their economies after the war ; and it would certainly exceed growth during the industrial revolution .
That growth , too , was driven by technological change and by an explosion in trade and capital flows , but by today 's standards it was a glacial affair .
Between 1870 and 1913 world GDP per head increased by an average of only 1.3 % a year .
This means that the first decade of the 21st century could see the fastest growth in average world income in the whole of history .
Financial wobbles this summer acted as a reminder that emerging economies are more volatile than rich - country ones ; yet their long - run prospects look excellent , so long as they continue to move towards free and open markets , sound fiscal and monetary policies and better education .
Because they start with much less capital per worker than developed economies , they have huge scope for boosting productivity by importing Western machinery and know - how .
Catching up is easier than being a leader .
When America and Britain were industrialising in the 19th century , they took 50 years to double their real incomes per head ; today China is achieving the same feat in nine years .
What 's new
Emerging economies as a group have been growing faster than developed economies for several decades .
So why are they now making so much more of a difference to the old rich world ?
The first reason is that the gap in growth rates between the old and the new world has widened ( see chart 3 ) .
But more important , emerging economies have become more integrated into the global system of production , with trade and capital flows accelerating relative to GDP in the past ten years .
China joined the World Trade Organisation only in 2001 .
It is having a bigger global impact than other emerging economies because of its vast size and its unusual openness to trade and investment with the rest of the world .
The sum of China 's total exports and imports amounts to around 70 % of its GDP , against only 25 - 30 % in India or America .
By next year , China is likely to account for 10 % of world trade , up from 4 % in 2000 .
What is also new is that the internet has made it possible radically to reorganise production across borders .
Thanks to information technology , many once non-tradable services , such as accounting , can be provided from afar , exposing more sectors in the developed world to competition from India and elsewhere .
Faster growth that lifts the living standards of hundreds of millions of people in poor countries should be a cause for celebration .
Instead , many bosses , workers and politicians in the rich world are quaking in their boots as output and jobs shift to low - wage economies in Asia or eastern Europe .
Yet on balance , rich countries should gain from poorer ones getting richer .
The success of the emerging economies will boost both global demand and supply .
Rising exports give developing countries more money to spend on imports from richer ones .
And although their average incomes are still low , their middle classes are expanding fast , creating a vast new market .
Over the next decade , almost a billion new consumers will enter the global marketplace as household incomes rise above the threshold at which people generally begin to spend on non-essential goods .
Emerging economies have already become important markets for rich - world firms : over half of the combined exports of America , the euro area and Japan go to these poorer economies .
The rich economies ' trade with developing countries is growing twice as fast as their trade with one another .
The future boost to demand will be large .
But more important in the long term will be the stimulus to the world economy from what economists call a “ positive supply shock ” .
As China , India and the former Soviet Union have embraced market capitalism , the global labour force has , in effect , doubled .
The world 's potential output is also being lifted by rapid productivity gains in developing countries as they try to catch up with the West .
This increased vitality in emerging economies is raising global growth , not substituting for output elsewhere .
The newcomers boost real incomes in the rich world by supplying cheaper goods , such as microwave ovens and computers , by allowing multinational firms to reap bigger economies of scale , and by spurring productivity growth through increased competition .
They will thus help to lift growth in world GDP just when the rich world 's greying populations would otherwise cause it to slow .
Developed countries will do better from being part of this fast - growing world than from trying to cling on to a bigger share of a slow - growing one .
Stronger growth in emerging economies will make developed countries as a whole better off , but not everybody will be a winner .
The integration of China and other developing countries into the world trading system is causing the biggest shift in relative prices and incomes ( of labour , capital , commodities , goods and assets ) for at least a century , and this , in turn , is leading to a big redistribution of income .
For example , whereas prices of the labour - intensive goods that China and others export are falling , prices of the goods they import , notably oil , are rising .
In particular , the new ascendancy of the emerging economies has changed the relative returns to labour and capital .
Because these economies ' global integration has made labour more abundant , workers in developed countries have lost some of their bargaining power , which has put downward pressure on real wages .
Workers ' share of national income in those countries has fallen to its lowest level for decades , whereas the share of profits has surged .
It seems that Western workers are not getting their full share of the fruits of globalisation .
This is true not just for the lowest - skilled ones but increasingly also for more highly qualified ones in , say , accountancy and computer programming .
If wages continue to disappoint , there could be a backlash from workers and demands for protection from low - cost competition .
But countries that try to protect jobs and wages through import barriers or restrictions on offshoring will only hasten their relative decline .
The challenge for governments in advanced economies is to find ways to spread the benefits of globalisation more fairly without reducing the size of those gains .
The high share of profits and low share of wages in national income are not the only numbers that have strayed a long way from their historical average .
An alarming number of economic variables are currently way out of line with what conventional economic models would predict .
America 's current - account deficit is at a record high , yet the dollar has remained relatively strong .
Global interest rates are still historically low , despite strong growth and heavy government borrowing .
Oil prices have tripled since 2002 , yet global growth remains robust and inflation , though rising , is still relatively low .
House prices , however , have been soaring in many countries .
Puzzling it out
This survey will argue that all of these puzzles can be explained by the growing impact of emerging economies .
For instance , low bond yields and the dollar 's refusal to plunge are partly due to the way these countries have been piling up foreign reserves .
Likewise , higher oil prices have mostly been caused by strong demand from developing countries rather than by an interruption of supply , so they have done less harm to global growth than in the past .
And their impact on inflation has been offset by falling prices of goods exported by emerging economies .
This has also made it easier for central banks to achieve their inflation goals with much lower interest rates than in the past .
All this will require some radical new thinking about economic policy .
Governments may need to harness the tax and benefit system to compensate some workers who lose from globalisation .
Monetary policy also needs to be revamped .
Central bankers like to take the credit for the defeat of inflation , but emerging economies have given them a big helping hand , both by pushing down the prices of many goods and by restraining wages in developed countries .
This has allowed central banks to hold interest rates at historically low levels .
But they have misunderstood the monetary - policy implications of a positive supply shock .
By keeping interest rates too low , they have allowed a build - up of excess liquidity which has flowed into the prices of assets such as homes , rather than into traditional inflation .
They have encouraged too much borrowing and too little saving .
In America the overall result has been to widen the current - account deficit .
The central banks ' mistake has been compounded by the emerging economies ' refusal to allow their exchange rates to rise , piling up foreign - exchange reserves instead .
Bizarrely , by financing America 's deficit , poor countries are subsidising the world 's richest consumers .
The opening up of emerging economies has thus not only provided a supply of cheap labour to the world , it has also offered an increased supply of cheap capital .
But this survey will argue that the developing countries will not be prepared to go on financing America 's massive current - account deficit for much longer .
At some point , therefore , America 's cost of capital could rise sharply .
There is a risk that the American economy will face a sharp financial shock and a recession , or an extended period of sluggish growth .
This will slow growth in the rest of the world economy .
But America is less important as a locomotive for global growth than it used to be , thanks to the greater vigour of emerging economies .
America 's total imports from the rest of the world last year amounted to only 4 % of world GDP .
The greater risk to the world economy is that a recession and falling house prices would add to Americans ' existing concerns about stagnant real wages , creating more support for protectionism .
That would be bad both for the old rich countries and the new emerging stars .
But regardless of how the developed world responds to the emerging giants , their economic power will go on growing .
The rich world has yet to feel the full heat from this new revolution .
Why is it that companies are responsible for being both the cause of and cure for poverty in this nation ?
I have grown particularly tired of individuals who have little understanding of business operating costs advocating hikes in wages .
The actions of companies are , after all , simple actions by any human .
There is no inherent abnormal evil within a corporation .
The most common argument claims that companies have a nearly infinite amount of money ; shareholders will not lose more than a few pennies apiece with a wage raise .
Surely , K - Mart could afford to pay employees two dollars more per hour .
I guess these wage advocates are partially right .
Yes , companies could pay their workers more .
But companies do not act any different than the average consumer or wage - raising advocate .
Why would any person pay more for a good than they value it ?
The ability to raise wages lies in the hands of both consumers and companies .
Suppose consumers began tipping a dollar to every employee who works for a business .
A checkout clerk at Wal - Mart would make $ 20 to $ 30 an hour from this form of exchange .
Yet I have never heard any defenders of the poor advocate such a system .
This consumer behavior would raise wages for the poor ten times more than the few cents or dollars suggested by minimum wage laws .
Consumers would have the ability to improve the welfare of low - skilled workers directly .
In fact , I could use the same argument that minimum wage advocates use .
How much is one more dollar tipped to a gas station attendant going to affect you when you have already pumped $ 40 into your tank ?
No person can truly argue that a dollar would be too much .
Yet no one willingly gives the extra buck .
If individuals are so concerned about low wages , then they should start tipping every low paid worker possible .
One dollar is not too much .
Come on , it is only a tiny percentage of anyone 's total paycheck .
It is the same argument used against businesses , applied to the consumer .
What most people do not realize is that they behave exactly like " evil " corporations .
Who wants to pay more than they have to for anything ?
These defenders of poverty ask corporations to make decisions that no one would make on their own .
Suppose you went into a grocery store and saw bananas for $ 3 .
Would you go up to the cashier and say , " I think I will pay $ 5 even though the price tag says $ 3 " ?
The fact is that we are all always looking for a better deal .
This search for better deals is the cornerstone of a market economy ; it promotes competition among companies .
Despite this obvious fact , large portions of the population still think big businesses should pay employees more .
Few people understand that employees are just like other goods .
They hold a certain value relative to the business owner ’s needs .
A minimum wage law can push the minimum wage to $ 8 an hour but this does not change the fact that the worker may be valued at $ 6 to the company .
The government can push the minimum wage law to a million dollars an hour , but any push in the minimum wage will not change the value of a worker .
Instead , when the minimum wage is raised , unemployment occurs .
The company will not pay $ 8 for something it values at $ 6 .
Let 's take this back to the consumer perspective .
Say you are going to the grocery store and you want to buy a tuna steak .
You value the tuna steak at no more than $ 6 .
You like tuna steak but not so much that you would pay over $ 6 .
You are happy to accept any price up to $ 6 , and the lower the better .
Now you get to the grocery store and see the tuna steak is $ 8 .
You do n't value the tuna steak at $ 8 , so you do n't purchase it .
You most likely acquire an alternative .
Similarly , a company will not employ a person at $ 8 if they are only worth $ 6 .
Consumers do not pay more for a product than they value it .
Yet companies are expected to pay more for an employee than the employee is worth .
" When it 's a company , it 's u2018evil ' ; when it's me , it 's ok " , is the logic .
Wage advocates are telling us that a person is " evil " if they desire to pay no more than they value a particular good .
A person is immoral because they do not purchase a tuna steak at $ 8 even though they value it at $ 6 .
This idea is absolutely ridiculous !
The role of raising wages is always placed on corporations despite the fact that consumers also control the outcome .
This same mentality is applied to taxpayers .
Plenty of socialists talk about the " public good " and the " collective . "
The productive members of society should pay high taxes for the " public good " so that the unemployed can have a better standard of living through redistribution .
Once again , why must it be the taxpayer who takes the action for the " public good " ?
Could I not also say that the unemployed person should get a job for the " public good " ?
If he or she finds a job , the burden on the rest of society is lifted .
But I have never heard a socialist advocate the unemployed finding employment for the " public good . "
It seems that all actions that require benefiting the public good should be placed in the hands of taxpayers and corporations .
The responsibility of an individual for the public good and , most importantly , his own good is out the window .
The actions are equal .
One action requires a taxpayer taking the action .
The other action involves the unemployed person taking action .
However when we examine this situation closer , it is obvious that the two sides are not equal actions .
When the taxpayer has his money stolen by the government , he only benefits the " public good " and the fairyland " collective . "
When the unemployed person gets a job , he benefits himself as well as the " public good " and the fictitious " collective . "
There clearly seems to be greater gain in choosing the latter option .
The latter option has two benefits while the first has only one .
Looking at the two suggestions , it is necessary to analyze how these policies would be implemented .
The socialist nut cases supporting these absurd ideas want to tax the rich .
There is no asking going on here .
The idea is to forcefully and coercively tax individuals for the " great collective . "
Libertarians are not coercive or forceful in their suggestions .
Libertarians advocate natural market incentives without government subsidies .
No libertarian , for example , suggests forced work farms for the unemployed .
The nature of the two suggestions is entirely different in this aspect .
One group advocates force while the other does not .
Would not forced work farms also be solutions to unemployment ?
Sure , they would .
But Libertarians believe that the only " collective " good worth preserving is freedom and liberty .
On the other side , freedom and liberty are sacrifices to the bloodthirsty gods of egalitarianism .
Everything comes back to human action .
You do n't pay $ 8 for a tuna steak you value at $ 6 .
You do n't pay a worker $ 8 and hour if you value them at $ 6 an hour .
It is plain , simple , clear human nature .
We cannot expect others to take actions that we ourselves would not do .
To call these people immoral is to call ourselves equally immoral .
The only way to realize such action is through force and coercion ; no person will buy overpriced tuna steaks naturally .
What is best for each individual in voluntary trade is best for the market economy as a whole .

The Best of Vedran Vuk
DIGG THIS
In writing this open letter to you , let me first say that I admire what you are doing .
The Innocence Project is one of the good things to come from what we call modern political liberalism , and I am glad you are doing this kind of work .
Furthermore , your efforts to free wrongfully - convicted people — especially those people who simply cannot afford the legal talent that they need — are heroic and despite the attacks by law - and - order conservatives like Ann Coulter , you are performing something that is vital to a " free " society .
Yet , while I deeply appreciate all that you are doing , I also must tell you that you are ignoring one of the biggest threats to your work that ever has existed , and helping to hasten this threat are organizations that often have stood shoulder - to - shoulder with you .
To put it briefly , the infamous Duke non-rape case , being pushed by the lawless prosecutor Michael Nifong , threatens to undo all of the good that you have done since your founding almost 15 years ago .
I will get right to the point :
The basis for your being able to exonerate wrongfully - convicted people has been DNA testing , and many people have been able to leave prisons as free men because DNA tests have demonstrated that they did not commit the crimes for which they were convicted .
Yet , in Durham , North Carolina , we have the kind of DNA evidence that you would love to have , the kind of evidence that is the stuff of jubilant press releases from your organization .
Unfortunately , according to Nifong , the DNA means nothing because it does not permit him to create the scenario that he is insisting MUST be the case .
Furthermore , the NAACP , which has backed your efforts , also is demanding that all exculpatory DNA results be ignored so a jury can wrongfully convict Reade Seligmann , Collin Finnerty , and David Evans .
If you are willing to listen to me , I will tell you how this scenario has come about , and why Nifong ’s actions are a major threat to the important work you are doing .
Should you ignore me , or simply blow off what I am telling you , I can guarantee you that your indifference surely will mean more wrongful convictions , and it will make your efforts to free innocent people much more difficult and expensive than currently is the case .
In short , you cannot afford to ignore what I have to tell you .
Let me start from the beginning .
Early on the morning of March 14 , 2006 , a black stripper told Durham , North Carolina , police that while she was " performing " at a party hosted by members of the Duke University Lacrosse team that a number of young men grabbed her , dragged her to a bathroom , and raped and sodomized her for about 30 minutes .
Immediately after she told police and hospital personnel that she had been raped , her body was carefully examined and swabbed for traces of DNA that would have been left there by the accused rapists .
Investigators found semen and must have thought they hit paydirt , and all samples quickly were collected and ready for examination .
Moreover , the medical reports that were filed after the examination do not point to rape , and any trauma to her body is easily explained by her other recent sexual encounters .
Because the alleged rape occurred at a lacrosse team party , Nifong was able to get a friendly judge to immediately order that all 46 white members of the team give DNA samples to the police .
In demanding the samples , Nifong told the court that the DNA tests would identify who was guilty of rape , and who could be excluded .
Nifong told the media , “ How does DNA exonerate you ?
It ’s either a match or there ’s not a match . ”
As we know , the lacrosse players — all strongly declaring their innocence — willingly gave the samples , even after their attorneys advised them that even a slight touch on the woman ’s body would incriminate them , and that they could fight the overly - broad order .
The DNA samples were sent to the state lab — and came back with no matches with the lacrosse players .
Nifong , as you might have heard , immediately went from DNA - tells - us - what - we - need - to - know to " DNA ?
We do n’t need no stinkin ’ DNA ! "
The press weighed in , and then we heard the fiction that all the players needed were some condoms , something you know would not necessarily hide anything , since condoms leave residue and there still would be traces of DNA from other sources — unless the alleged rapists were wearing space suits , which seems to be what Nifong is claiming these days .
Unfortunately , even your co-founder , Peter J. Neufeld , has made some comments on this case that , while technically true , are very misleading .
Yes , as Neufeld said , “ There have been thousands and thousands of men who have been convicted in the United States of the crime of rape without DNA and without semen , " but the reason for that has been that most women who claim they have been raped wait for several days before speaking to the authorities , and any potential DNA sources by then are scientifically useless .
In the case of the Duke accuser , police were able to treat her body as a crime scene , and they were able to obtain numerous DNA matches — of other men .
Furthermore , you surely are aware that the director of the private lab that examined the DNA matches colluded with Nifong to withhold DNA evidence favorable to the defendants .
Declares the Raleigh News & Observer in a December 15 , 2006 , story :
The head of a private DNA laboratory said under oath today that he and District Attorney Mike Nifong agreed not to report DNA results favorable to Duke lacrosse players charged with rape .
Brian Meehan , director of DNA Security of Burlington , said his lab found DNA from unidentified men in the underwear , pubic hair and rectum of the woman who said she was gang - raped at a lacrosse party in March .
Nurses at Duke Hospital collected the samples a few hours after the alleged assault .
Meehan said the DNA did not come from Reade Seligmann , David Evans , or Collin Finnerty , who have been charged with rape and sexual assault in the case .
You need to let that sink in .
The prosecutor and the head of the lab examining the DNA agreed to withhold evidence .
You have seen that before , have you not ?
How many times has the Innocence Project been involved in cases in which it has been discovered — after the conviction — that the prosecution was holding back exculpatory evidence ?
It gets worse .
Despite these revelations , the case plunges forward , and many people in the black community , including the NAACP and the black ministers , have openly said that they do not want DNA to be considered here , and that the only resolution that they will accept is a full set of rape convictions .
Let us think what that means .
Many of your cases have involved men convicted of rape by juries that were convinced by eyewitness testimony , yet the absence of DNA — when other DNA was present — led to these convictions being overturned .
Many of those who you have managed to have exonerated are black males , and the NAACP and other black - oriented organizations stood firmly behind you .
Remember Darryl Hunt ?
He was convicted in a North Carolina court for the rape and murder of Debra Sykes , but you managed to get him out after he served nearly 20 years because Hunt ’s DNA was not found in and on the body of Ms. Sykes .
Hunt even received a pardon from North Carolina ’s governor this year .
Yet , there is substantially no difference in the Hunt and the Duke cases .
The Duke accuser clearly had sexual relations with a number of other men .
Furthermore , she claimed that the Duke players did not wear condoms , and that one of them ejaculated in her mouth .
Thus , we are left with the prosecution claiming both that the woman ’s account of the rape is true — but simultaneously is not true .
In a court of law , your lawyers would jump all over that one , but yet in the Duke case , this one lives on .
Here is the problem .
Yes , over time even if there were a conviction , those convictions would be overturned by the appellate courts — or at least one hopes that the higher courts would overturn them .
Because this case is so politically charged ( which is why it even has any life at all ) , one can not be sure that the judges on the appeals and supreme courts would be willing to be seen as " protecting " wealthy white males against the claims of a poor , black female .
But even a conviction that was overturned still would mean that innocent men would be sent to prison , if only for a few years , but prison nonetheless .
Furthermore , our system is one that runs on precedent .
If Michael Nifong can convince a Durham jury — one that most likely would not need any evidence to convict these men — that Seligmann , Finnerty , and Evans are guilty , then this conviction will embolden other prosecutors to do the same thing .
You and I both know that many , if not most , prosecutors in this country cut corners , hide evidence , and often lie in court .
For the most part , prosecutors today do not care if the person on trial actually committed a crime .
They just want to win .
You know that mentality , and you have come to hate it .
If Nifong is able to continue pushing this case to trial , and if he were to win — heaven forbid — then your work suddenly would be made much harder .
Prosecutors would fight you even more , citing the Duke precedence , and you would be forced to expend more resources , which also would mean you could exonerate fewer people .
So far , you have been silent , save Neufeld ’s misleading remarks .
Yet , if you remain silent , you are doing two things .
First , you are guaranteeing future defeats for your cause when there should be victory , and second , you are withholding a moral and authoritative voice that needs to be crying out here .
I would remind you that justice is not something that applies only to those people who are currently politically favored .
There is nothing just about prosecuting three young men for a crime they did not commit , not matter what their race or social status , just as there is nothing just in prosecuting young black men who are innocent of the crimes of which they are accused .
Over the years , yours has been a voice in the wilderness .
The Ann Coulters of the world have decried your efforts to right wrongs , and their words condemn them .
However , if you remain silent now , you risk undoing much of the good — and goodwill — that you have created .
Thus , I would ask you — implore you — to rethink your silence , for if you remain quiet in the face of this injustice , you are doing nothing but empowering dishonest prosecutors , and your failure to do right in this situation will come back and haunt you many times .
The Best of William L. Anderson
Bill Clinton 's been making the rounds .
On Larry King last night , he had this to say about Lieberman :
I do n't have the same view of this as some people do .
My view is Connecticut is an unmitigated blessing for the Democrats because Lieberman has said if he wins he 's going to vote with us to organize the Senate .
I 'm interested in getting one of these houses back , because that 's the only way , I think , we can move away from the philosophical and political and economic direction the country has taken in the last five years .
So I 'm doing what I can to help the Democrats win the House and the Senate or both .
There 's been a lot of this discussion around -- either way we win in Connecticut by keeping the seat in Democratic hands .
Despite the fact that we have absolutely no assurance that Lieberman will live up to his pledge to caucus with the Democrats , there 's this from the LamontBlog to consider :
In a hypothetical world where the Democrats take control of the Senate in November , Sen. Lieberman wins due to massive GOP turnout , and he deigns to caucus with the Democrats , he may very well become Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
He already owes zero allegiance to Democrats , whose clear verdict he discarded after the primary , and who will have voted in even greater numbers against him in the general .
But he would owe a hell of a lot to Republican lobbyists , Republican elected officials , Republican voters , Republican fundraisers , neoconservative ideologues , Karl Rove , and people like the chairman of Scooter Libby 's Defense Fund , who are currently keeping his campaign afloat , keeping his ads on the air , keeping his staffers paid .
The Committee he is in a position to become chair of , Homeland Security and Govermental Affairs , has some pretty important oversight issues , as noted in The Hill :
The issue of Lieberman 's seniority would arise most dramatically if Lieberman wins re-election and Democrats recapture control of the chamber .
That would slot Lieberman to take over as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , the panel primarily responsible for investigating the executive branch ....
Allowing Lieberman to retain his seniority could put the senator now running as an independent in charge of the Senate 's chief investigative committee .
If Democrats took control of either chamber they would likely launch investigations of the White House 's handling of the war in Iraq and homeland security .
Just sayin' .

When we look back after 370 million years of evolution , the invasion of land by fish appears special .
However , if we could transport ourselves by time machine to this early period , it is n't clear whether we would notice anything extraordinary .
We would see a lot of fish , some of them big and some of them small , all of them struggling to survive and reproduce .
Only now , 370 million years later , do we see that one of those fish sat at the base of a huge branch of the tree of life — a branch that includes everything from salamanders to humans .
It would have taken an uncanny sixth sense for us to have predicted this outcome when our time machine deposited us in the middle of the Devonian .
THE " GREAT " TRANSITION
By Neil H. Shubin Introduction by John Brockman Evolutionary biologist Neil Shubin writes : " Within each of us — our skeletons , our behavior , and deep within our DNA — lurks our distant past .
Make the relevant comparisons and we find that our hands resemble fossil fish fins , our heads are organized like long - extinct jawless fish , and major parts of our genomes look and function like those of worms and bacteria .
We unlock our history as we understand more about our DNA , as we compare ourselves to animals living and dead , and as we discover new fossils from around the world .
With all of this history in our bodies , we are most definitely not designed ' intelligently . '
Our chances of developing certain cancers , hernias , bad backs , injured knees , and even hiccups are the result of the history that we share with fish , worms , and clams .
" " We live in an age of discovery where the classic stories of evolution have become the focus of vigorous new approaches from genetics and developmental biology .
Breakthroughs in genetics are beginning to tell us how bodies are built , in essence giving insights into the recipe that builds animals from a single celled egg .
Couple these breakthroughs with the remarkable fossil discoveries of the past decade , and we have opportunity to present a new worldview of the human body . "
Shubin , a leading researcher in fish - to - tetrapod transition , startled the world on March 31 with the announcement in the journal Science of the discovery of Tiktaalik , '' a mosaic of primitive fish and derived amphibian " , which led to global headlines .
His moment of realization occurred while digging fish bones out of rocks on a snowy July afternoon .
" While studying 380 million year old rocks in Ellesmere Island , at a latitude of 80 North , I was uncovering one of the key transitional stages in the shift from fish to land living animal .
Everybody knows that fish swim with fins and animals that walk on land have legs .
I was in the Arctic to learn how this shift happened .
The fish I was uncovering had a wrist and fingers .
A fish with wrists and fingers ?
I was immediately struck that this fossil reveals a very deep branch of my evolutionary tree .
This is the origin of my wrists and fingers .
Huddled in the tent during prolonged Arctic storms , it occurred to me that 3.5 billion years in the history of life are embedded in my own body . "
Shubin 's essay , " The ' Great ' Transition " , was written after the discovery but prior to the March 31 announcement .
It is excerpted from Intelligent Thought : Science Versus the Intelligent Design Movement .

Neil Shubin's Edge Bio THE " GREAT " TRANSITION
By Neil H. Shubin
The take - home message of this essay is a simple one :
The transition of animals from water to land in the Devonian period , 370 million years ago , was profoundly important in one sense and entirely trivial in another .
It had a major impact on our world , but it did not involve any unusual or extraordinary biological processes .
The effects of the transition are all around us .
We see them in the rocks .
We see them in ponds and seas around the world .
We even see them when we shake hands .
Let me explain .
When we look back after 370 million years of evolution , the invasion of land by fish appears special .
However , if we could transport ourselves by time machine to this early period , it is n't clear whether we would notice anything extraordinary .
We would see a lot of fish , some of them big and some of them small , all of them struggling to survive and reproduce .
Only now , 370 million years later , do we see that one of those fish sat at the base of a huge branch of the tree of life — a branch that includes everything from salamanders to humans .
It would have taken an uncanny sixth sense for us to have predicted this outcome when our time machine deposited us in the middle of the Devonian .
To get a glimpse of the water - to - land transition , we need to see the creatures that lived on Earth at that time , then we need to look at our world today .
When we do this , we see something sublime :
The ancient world was transformed by ordinary mechanisms of evolution , with genes and biological processes that are still at work , both around us and inside our bodies .
The gulf between water and land looks like an unbridgeable divide .
The challenges of life on land are vastly different from those in water .
It would seem that completely different animals must live in these distinct habitats .
Animals that walk on land need to cope with gravity ; unlike water , air does not support animals as they move about .
Animals also can dry out on land ; this is particularly dangerous , because water is needed for many basic metabolic processes .
And , of course , breathing is different in water than on land .
Animals that breathe air need a more efficient way than gills to take in air and extract oxygen .
Because of all these factors , there are a daunting number of features that distinguish land - living animals from their fish ancestors : limbs with fingers and toes , necks , backbones with bony connections between vertebrae , a bony inner ear , a large scapula , ribs , paired nostrils , and so on .
Biologists have singled out one of these characteristics for special treatment :
True limbs are not seen in any living fish ; for this reason , everything that is descended from fish is called a tetrapod ( from the Greek for " four - footed " ) .
For a long time it was thought that the shift from fish to tetrapod was driven by a transition from life in water to life on land .
For example , it was thought that fins gradually evolved into limbs as animals began to walk .
This thinking was captured by a famous hypothesis originally proposed by the American geologist Joseph Barrell in 1916 and later by the great American paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer .
Romer and Barrell speculated that fish were forced out of water when Earth 's climate supposedly became drier some 370 million years ago .
As the ponds dried , so the story went , the fish had to learn to survive on land and so developed features that enabled them to hop from pond to pond .
When Romer did his work , in the 1920s through the 1960s , there was only one early tetrapod known : a limbed creature recovered from 365 - million - year - old - rocks in East Greenland .
At present , East Greenland is a cold desert — dry , mountainous , and well within the Arctic Circle .
Temperatures there rarely rise above freezing and for much of the year are colder than - 20 F .
But 365 million years ago East Greenland was a much warmer place , containing warm - water swamps , streams , and ponds .
In the 1920s , a Swedish team led by Gunnar Save - Soderberg discovered the skeletons of the then - earliest - known tetrapods in these rocks .
These animals had robust limbs , appeared to be partly land - living , and supported Barrell 's and Romer 's hypothesis — at least , initially .
To see how our theories have changed since Romer 's day , we need to follow new evidence , whose trail leads to notions completely unforeseen even twenty years ago .
This change in thinking attests to the power of evidence and the way it can change our view of the world .
In 1987 my colleague , Jenny Clack , began new studies in East Greenland and found the first important piece of evidence bearing on this water - land transition in over fifty years .
She discovered the skeleton of another truly extraordinary tetrapod — one even more primitive than the one discovered by Save - Soderbergh .
Sure enough , this creature has limbs with fingers and toes .
It also has a very tetrapod - like hip , neck , and ear .
What is remarkable is that this , the most primitive known tetrapod , is aquatic .
It is not remotely specialized for life on land .
It has fingers and toes but they are set within a limb that looks like a flipper .
The limbs are delicate structures and seem unable to have supported the weight of the animal on land .
It has a pair of hind limbs , but behind that is a tail that resembles that of a fish .
Most important , this tetrapod has big gills .
The inescapable conclusion is that the most primitive tetrapod was an aquatic creature .
The implications are profound :
The fish - to - tetrapod transition likely happened not in creatures that were adapting to land but in creatures living in water .
Moreover , everything special about tetrapods — limbs , digits , ribs , neck , the lot -- might well have evolved in water , not on land .
This hypothesis made a prediction that could be tested : Aquatic animals more ancient than this new find should have intermediate structures .
A search for these kinds of fossils dovetailed nicely with my own expeditionary research program in the late 1980s .
Back then , my colleague Ted Daeschler and I were uncovering fish and tetrapods of the same age as Jenny 's Greenland fossils in the roadcuts of central Pennsylvania .
Pennsylvania is dotted with rocks of the same age as those of Greenland , but they need to be uncovered by dramatic means .
The good news is that the state is not a frozen desert ; the bad news is that fossils and rocks are mostly covered with trees , lawns , and cities .
As a consequence , Ted and I made paleontological careers out of following the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation every time it cut a new road in central Pennsylvania .
We found many fossils , but all of them were too young to test the issue at hand .
We needed to go to a different area .
Ted and I ultimately found inspiration in an atypical place .
We began a whole new research program that sprang from a single figure in a twenty - year - old textbook .
I was thumbing through my old college geology text and found a map that seemed unremarkable at first .
It was a map of North America with colored patches showing where rocks between 360 million and 380 million years old are preserved .
One big splotch was on the east coast of Greenland , home to Jenny 's find ; another patch covered the part of Pennsylvania where most of our field effort had been focused .
There was still another such area , though , and this is what made the figure interesting .
Large , and running east - west across the Canadian Arctic , this patch extended over 500 miles and had never been explored by vertebrate paleontologists , although it was well known to geologists , particularly the Canadian geologists and paleobotanists who had mapped it extraordinarily well .
The rocks turned out to be older than those in Pennsylvania and Greenland .
Ted and I first visited this area in 1999 and found little of interest .
As it happened , we were fumbling around in the wrong part of the section ; the rocks we were looking at were in the middle of an ancient ocean environment .
When we shifted the expedition to areas that preserved ancient streams , lakes , and ponds , we found more fossils .
During the 2004 field season , in these ancient environments , we found what we were looking for .
Buried within a 370 - million - year - old shallow stream was a collection of whole skeletons , one on top of the other .
One of these creatures is an astonishing new kind of fish .
The new fish has fins , scales , and gills .
By all definitions , it is a fish .
This designation seems to hold until we look at its skeleton .
Inside the fin is the skeletal pattern of all tetrapod limbs , in primitive form .
It has an arm bone , a forearm , even a wrist .
The new fish has a neck much like that of the earliest amphibians .
The skull of this fish is not cone - shaped , as fish skulls are , but flattened like a crocodile 's , with a nostril on either side .
This creature also has expanded ribs , something unknown in any fish .
We had found , one of my colleagues mentioned in jest , a fishapod .
The fishapod underscores one important point :
It is no longer easy to distinguish a fish from a tetrapod .
The arctic fossils were only the tip of a paleontological iceberg ; after subsequent discoveries in Latvia , Scotland , and China , the distinction is now so fuzzy that many of my colleagues do not even try to define tetrapods by ticking off a list of features .
Our earlier definition of tetrapods distinguished them from fish by their possession of limbs .
In what group , then , do we put our fish with wrists ?
What other characteristics might help us ?
Perhaps we could use lungs to distinguish tetrapods from fish .
Then we would have to explain why lungfish use gills and lungs both , yet have fully formed fish fins .
Scales ?
Even here , we run into the same problem , because early limbed and lunged animals also have belly scales .
Indeed , the difficulty that our taxonomists have in distinguishing tetrapods from fish is the inevitable result of finding fossil intermediates .
This practical problem reflects a significant reality .
One of the major transitions in the history of life is now bridged by a series of fossils dating from 380 million to 360 million years ago .
The fact that we have discovered intermediates is not surprising ; the surprise is that these creatures all appear to be aquatic and not specially adapted to life on land .
This insight begs the question :
Is there really a great divide between life in water and life on land ?
Answers to this question come from the study of fish alive today .
Modern fish have adapted to live in very different environments , including on the sea floor , in the shallows of lakes or streams , even partly in air .
To cope with these environments , they have a remarkable set of features that enable them to walk , breathe , and even climb .
For example , the various species of walking fish have evolved " armlike " bones and joints allowing them to prop up and propel their bodies along the ground .
Some fish , like the mudskipper , maneuver in mudflats and spend a considerable period of their lives outside water , able to breathe air because the back of their mouth can absorb oxygen and relay it to the bloodstream .
Mudskippers can hop good distances on the mudflats ; some of them even climb trees by reaching up the trunk with their front fins and holding on with their hind fins .
What is important is that these various adaptations to land have evolved many times in fish .
Several different kinds of fish climb trees ; in addition , there are many different species of fish that breathe air , live part of their life on land , and walk about .
The boundary between water and land is quite porous and bridged by modern fish from around the world .
In fact , the adaptations we see in the fossils of the fish - tetrapod transition seem almost trivial in comparison to the living animals .
Mudskippers and the other walking fish are all very interesting , but are they extraordinary in an evolutionary sense ?
No , they are not , and the reason is instructive .
Hopping , climbing , and breathing fish are just animals that have evolved to live in different kinds of aquatic and subaereal habitats .
They are able to breathe air , hop , or climb because of subtle changes to their bodies ; no revolutionary changes are needed .
In evolutionary terms , the only way they will be notable is if their lineage is prolific and their descendants do great things .
The relatives of the fish and tetrapods from Canada and Greenland were prolific ; they are part of a trunk of the evolutionary tree that gave rise to every tetrapod — every bird , mammal , reptile , and amphibian .
The mudskipper has a long way to go , and many hurdles to leap , before we will know whether its part of the evolutionary tree is special .
If paleontologists 300 million years from now dig up the remains of a mudskipper , they will write chapters about its role in a " great " transition only if its part of the evolutionary tree has branched into many twigs .
The mudskipper will get extra special treatment if one of its evolutionary branches leads to the paleontologists ' own species .
Our understanding of the fish - to - tetrapod transition is not limited to long - dead fossils or obscure fish that climb trees .
We have access to the DNA of every creature alive today .
This is an enticing record of evolution , because DNA builds our bodies and is passed from generation to generation .
By knowing how DNA works , we can dissect the molecular machinery that builds animals .
This defines a whole new research program , one that was unimaginable in Romer 's day .
We can now compare the genetic recipe that builds a fish to the one that builds a tetrapod , in order to ask the question , What genetic changes are needed to turn a fish into a tetrapod ?
To see how this works , it helps to understand how DNA builds bodies .
Every cell of our body has the same DNA inside .
The various cells of our body are different because different genes are turned on and off in each cell .
To understand what makes a cell in your eye different from a cell in the bones of your hand , we need to know about the genetic switches controlling the activity of genes in each venue .
This leads us to the important point :
These genetic switches help to assemble us .
When we are conceived , we start as a single - celled embryo with the DNA needed to build our body .
To go from this generalized cell to a complete human with trillions of specialized cells packed in just the right way , whole batteries of genes need to be turned on and off at just the right stages of development .
For evolutionists , this information is a boon .
We can compare patterns of gene activity between different creatures to assess what kinds of changes are involved in the origin of new organs .
Take appendages , for example .
When we compare the ensemble of genes active in the development of a fish fin to those active in the development of a tetrapod limb , we can make a catalogue of the genetic differences between fins and limbs .
This comparison gives us some likely culprits — the genetic switches that may have changed during the origin of limbs .
Based on what we know so far , the list is small :
Very subtle changes in the activity of a relatively small number of genetic switches appear to underlie the differences between fins and limbs .
To some extent , this should be obvious from the paleontological discoveries .
Fins and limbs are part of a continuum , and no extraordinary events , processes , or genetic mechanisms are needed to explain the evolutionary transformation .
There are even clinical implications to all this .
The genetic switches involved in the fin- to - limb transition are not 370 million - year - old relicts that lie in our bodies unchanged from generation to generation .
Some of the genetic raw material of the fish - to - tetrapod transition still does business inside us .
In fact , these genes continually mutate , sometimes with great consequences .
Three hundred and seventy million years ago , changes to these genes led to the origin of limbs with fingers and toes .
What happens when these genes change nowadays ?
Mutations can cause missing , malformed , or extra fingers in children .
We now know that the " great " transformation from water to land has so many fossil intermediates that we can no longer conveniently distinguish between fish and tetrapod , that living fish are bridging the water - to - land transition today , that some of the genes implicated in the ancient transition still reside and mutate in living animals , making everything from fish fins to human hands .
Armed with this information , let 's return to our opening handshake .
The structures we shook with — our shoulder , elbow , and wrist — were first seen in fish living in streams over 370 million years ago .
Our firm clasp is made with a modified fish fin .
Actually , we carry an entire branch of the tree of life inside of us , and it does not stop there .
That broad smile we give when we shake hands ?
The jaws that form our grin arose during another ancient " great " transition .
The pair of eyes we use to make eye contact ?
These were the product of an even more ancient " great " transition .
The list goes on and on .
We can understand how all these things came about by using the same tools we did in this essay .
Perhaps that is what is so profound about evolution : Everyday biological processes can explain things that seem special or mysterious about the living world .
What is really powerful is that our explanations can be tested by an examination of the evidence .

Results hint that Europe may be in for a warm winter .
Blooming warm : a late onset of winter can cause horse chestnuts to burst into flower too soon .

Do you still have roses in bloom in your English garden ?
Then you might not be surprised to hear that Europe is experiencing the warmest autumn since Columbus first sailed to America .
Preliminary analysis shows that continental mean temperatures in September and October were 11 °C — that 's 1.8 °C higher than the long - term average for these months .
November was 2.5 °C higher than the average .
The results show that 2006 has beaten the ' hottest ' autumns of 1772 , 1938 and 2000 by about a degree .
Previous research has shown that spring seems to be coming earlier around the world ( see ' Warming planet shifts life north and early ' ) .
But autumn climate trends have been generally less well investigated .
That 's partly because warm autumns pose less stress on plants and animals than do temperature anomalies in spring , says Annette Menzel , a phenologist at the Technical University of Munich , Germany .
But warm autumns come with their own problems .
Some flowering trees , such as horse chestnuts , may spring into blossom before winter comes , causing problems later in the year .
And butterflies and other animals may face trouble if they miss the signal to reduce their activity for the winter .
A disruption in the usual pattern between temperature and food availability can cause starvation , Menzel says .
History lesson
Finding data to support seasonal trends can be tricky , however .
The instrumental record does n't date back much further than the onset of the twentieth century .
To get around this , Elena Xoplaki , a climate historian at the University of Bern in Switzerland , has looked at historic sources in Europe going back to the 1500s , such as weather observations recorded by monks , doctors and scholars1 .
She has now updated her reconstruction with the latest temperature data from NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
The unpublished study reveals that the past three months have been uniquely warm in the context of the past half millennium , even when the uncertainties related to the historic data are taken into account .
" Exceptionally warm autumns in one region or another would n't be so telling , " says Juerg Luterbacher , a climatologist at the University of Bern .
" But the signal is consistent over the whole European land mass , from Iceland to Greece . "
Going up
The change matches a trend .
Autumn temperatures in Europe have been rising by about 0.45 °C per decade over the past three decades .
The new data show that the past 30 years has been the warmest such period on record , and the past 10 years has been the warmest decade .
The strongest warming has been observed over the British Isles and Scandinavia .
Hot times : NASA data shows that Europe is abnormally warm , the United States mainly cool .
NASA
NASA data show an even more extreme autumn temperature anomaly for parts of the Arctic .
By contrast , large parts of the United States have been below average ( see map ) .
These data only go back to the 1950s .
Cause and effect
Weather is in essence a random phenomenon .
So extreme anomalies during a single season , such as the European summer heat wave of 2003 or this warm autumn of 2006 , can't be pinned to a single cause .
However , the autumn warming trend over the past few decades does strongly point to a significant human influence , says Luterbacher .

So what can we expect next ?
Xoplaki and Luterbacher have also looked at what winters were like after the 30 warmest autumns in their data set .
They found that Decembers and Februaries were generally warmer than the 1971 - 2000 European average , whereas Januaries were slightly cooler .
Seasonal climate forecasts by the British Met Office and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society predict a slightly higher probability of warm rather than cold winter conditions over parts of Europe this year .
However , cautions Lutenbacher , the skill of seasonal forecasts is low , and uncertainties rather large .

But children of blue - collar workers , who made up as much as 20 percent of the student body of the top grandes écoles 30 years ago , make up , at best , 2 percent today .
Few are minority students .
In the 1950's , only a small proportion of French students pursued higher education , leaving room for a slice of the working classes to get into the schools , said Vincent Tiberj , a sociologist who studies social inequalities in France .
Since then , the number of candidates for the schools has expanded far faster than the schools themselves .
At the same time , the channels leading into the schools have narrowed : the vast majority of students entering the grandes écoles today come from special two - year preparatory schools , which draw their students primarily from high schools in the country 's wealthiest neighborhoods .
" The top five or six grandes écoles recruit students from fewer than 50 high schools across France , " said Richard Descoings , director of the elite Paris Institute of Political Studies , better known as Sciences Po .
Administrators at the grandes écoles say students who do not follow the focused , specialized curriculum of the preparatory schools have almost no chance of being accepted .
And while , theoretically , top students from any high school in the country can apply for the preparatory schools , the system has become so rarefied that few people from working - class neighborhoods are even aware that the opportunity exists .
" There 's a lack of information , no one talked to us about the preparatory schools , " said Alexis Blasselle , 20 , the daughter of working - class parents and now a student at the exclusive École Polytechnique .
She learned of the preparatory schools by chance the summer after graduating from high school .
" The solution is n't to open up another avenue to get into the grandes écoles , but to make people aware of the possibility . "
Sciences
Po ( pronounced see-ahns po ) , alone among the elite schools , has opened a new avenue of entry for students .
High schools from disadvantaged neighborhoods nominate students , and Sciences Po then gives them oral examinations for intellectual curiosity and critical thinking .
This year , 50 students were admitted through the program , while 200 entered through the normal examination process .
The Conference of Grandes Écoles , an association of the 200 schools , has also started a program that reaches out to top students in working - class neighborhoods to help guide them through their high school years and better their chances of getting into a preparatory school .
Last week , defence lawyers acting for José Padilla , a US citizen detained as an " enemy combatant " , released a video showing a mission fraught with deadly risk - taking him to the prison dentist .
A group of masked guards in riot gear shackled his legs and hands , blindfolded him with black - out goggles and shut off his hearing with headphones , then marched him down the prison corridor .
Is Padilla really that dangerous ?
Far from it : his warders describe him as so docile and inactive that he could be mistaken for " a piece of furniture " .
The purpose of these measures appeared to be to sustain the regime under which he had lived for more than three years : total sensory deprivation .
He had been kept in a blacked - out cell , unable to see or hear anything beyond it .
Most importantly , he had had no human contact , except for being bounced off the walls from time to time by his interrogators .
As a result , he appears to have lost his mind .
I do n't mean this metaphorically .
I mean that his mind is no longer there .
The forensic psychiatrist who examined him says that he " does not appreciate the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him , is unable to render assistance to counsel , and has impairments in reasoning as the result of a mental illness , ie , post - traumatic stress disorder , complicated by the neuropsychiatric effects of prolonged isolation " .
José Padilla appears to have been lobotomised : not medically , but socially .
If this was an attempt to extract information , it was ineffective : the authorities held him without charge for three and half years .
Then , threatened by a supreme court ruling , they suddenly dropped their claims that he was trying to detonate a dirty bomb .
They have now charged him with some vague and lesser offences to do with support for terrorism .
He is unlikely to be the only person subjected to this regime .
Another " enemy combatant " , Ali al - Marri , claims to have been subject to the same total isolation and sensory deprivation , in the same naval prison in South Carolina .
God knows what is being done to people who have disappeared into the CIA 's foreign oubliettes .
That the US tortures , routinely and systematically , while prosecuting its " war on terror " can no longer be seriously disputed .
The Detainee Abuse and Accountability Project ( DAA ) , a coalition of academics and human - rights groups , has documented the abuse or killing of 460 inmates of US military prisons in Afghanistan , Iraq and at Guantánamo Bay .
This , it says , is necessarily a conservative figure : many cases will remain unrecorded .
The prisoners were beaten , raped , forced to abuse themselves , forced to maintain " stress positions " , and subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation and mock executions .
The New York Times reports that prisoners held by the US military at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan were made to stand for up to 13 days with their hands chained to the ceiling , naked , hooded and unable to sleep .
The Washington Post alleges that prisoners at the same airbase were " commonly blindfolded and thrown into walls , bound in painful positions , subjected to loud noises and deprived of sleep " while kept , like Padilla and the arrivals at Guantánamo , " in black hoods or spray - painted goggles " .
Alfred McCoy , professor of history at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , argues that the photographs released from the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq reflect standard CIA torture techniques : " stress positions , sensory deprivation , and sexual humiliation " .
The famous picture of the hooded man standing on a box , with wires attached to his fingers , shows two of these techniques being used at once .
Unable to see , he has no idea how much time has passed or what might be coming next .
He stands in a classic stress position - maintained for several hours , it causes excruciating pain .
He appears to have been told that if he drops his arms he will be electrocuted .
What went wrong at Abu Ghraib is that someone took photos .
Everything else was done by the book .
Neither the military nor the civilian authorities have broken much sweat in investigating these crimes .
A few very small fish have been imprisoned ; a few others have been fined or reduced in rank ; in most cases the authorities have either failed to investigate or failed to prosecute .
The DAA points out that no officer has yet been held to account for torture practised by his subordinates .
US torturers appear to enjoy impunity , until they are stupid enough to take pictures of each other .
But Padilla 's treatment also reflects another glorious American tradition : solitary confinement .
Some 25,000 US prisoners are currently held in isolation - a punishment only rarely used in other democracies .
In some places , like the federal prison in Florence , Colorado , they are kept in sound - proofed cells and might scarcely see another human being for years on end .
They may touch or be touched by no one .
Some people have been kept in solitary confinement in the US for more than 20 years .
At Pelican Bay in California , where 1,200 people are held in the isolation wing , inmates are confined to tiny cells for 22 and a half hours a day , then released into an " exercise yard " for " recreation " .
The yard consists of a concrete well about 3.5 metres in length with walls 6 metres high and a metal grille across the sky .
The recreation consists of pacing back and forth , alone .
The results are much as you would expect .
As National Public Radio reveals , more than 10 % of the isolation prisoners at Pelican Bay are now in the psychiatric ward , and there 's a waiting list .
Prisoners in solitary confinement , according to Dr Henry Weinstein , a psychiatrist who studies them , suffer from " memory loss to severe anxiety to hallucinations to delusions ... under the severest cases of sensory deprivation , people go crazy . "
People who went in bad and dangerous come out mad as well .
The only two studies conducted so far - in Texas and Washington state - both show that the recidivism rates for prisoners held in solitary confinement are worse than for those who were allowed to mix with other prisoners .
If we were to judge the US by its penal policies , we would perceive a strange beast : a Christian society that believes in neither forgiveness nor redemption .
From this delightful experiment , US interrogators appear to have extracted a useful lesson : if you want to erase a man 's mind , deprive him of contact with the rest of the world .
This has nothing to do with obtaining information : torture of all kinds - physical or mental - produces the result that people will say anything to make it end .
It is about power , and the thrilling discovery that in the right conditions one man 's power over another is unlimited .
It is an indulgence which turns its perpetrators into everything they claim to be confronting .
President Bush maintains that he is fighting a war against threats to the " values of civilised nations " : terror , cruelty , barbarism and extremism .
He asked his nation 's interrogators to discover where these evils are hidden .
They should congratulate themselves .
They appear to have succeeded .
