If you were a nine - year - old girl in the year 1989 like I was , you might remember the movie Troop Beverly Hills , wherein a star - studded cast of scouts ( including Tori Spelling , singer Jenny Lewis , and Margeaux from Punky Brewster ) earns badges in accessorizing , shopping , and other mall - related pursuits .
I mention this fine film not just because I wanted to ( though that was part of it ) but because today I heard about another non-traditional scout discipline : creationism .
Answers in Genesis blog reports that the Girl Scouts of America has bestowed its highest honor , the Gold Award , on Wisconsin teen Annie Wichman .
Her winning accomplishments : amassing a library of creation literature for her church , building a model of Noah ’s ark , and teaching creationism to elementary schoolers .
She called her project Alternate Universe .
I ’m not convinced that this is an implicit endorsement of creationism on the part of the Girl Scouts of America .
According to the Gold Award website , a winning projects is :
… something that a girl can be passionate about — in thought , deed , and action .
The project is something that fulfills a need within a girl ’s community ( whether local or global ) , creates change , and hopefully , is something that becomes ongoing .
The goal is n’t scientific accuracy .
It ’s personal fulfillment and community involvement .
The teaching component irks me a little , especially if it was part of a science lesson in a public school instead of Sunday school at church .
But overall , Wichman ’s project seems pretty innocuous .
And it ’s unlikely that scouts will soon add creationism badges to their sashes , though given the panoply of activities that can earn you an insignia these days ( my favorite : Couch Potato .
“ Watching TV can be a fun , educational activity , a way to de-stress and relax sometimes .
Or it can be a very unhealthy way to pass the time .
It all depends on how and what you watch . ” ) it ’s not entirely out of the question .
So :
If you were to design a creationism badge , what might it look like ?

By By Carol Forsloff Aug 10 , 2009 in Politics Christian groups are being urged to swamp town hall meetings .
Some are being asked to attend and read the riot act to supporters of health care reform .
It is , after all , against God ’s plan for health reform , some religious right leaders now say .
This is the message from Jean Markell of Maple Grove–based Olive Tree Ministries who has asked her radio listeners to attend congressional town hall meetings and directed to “ to there and give them an earful .
The ideal thing to do is to to go to their town hall and read them the riot act — in Christian love — but read them the riot act on this issue of health care . ”
Still Rep. Michele Bachmann should be spared from criticism , as Markell continued : about the Congress woman from Minnesota : “ [ Michele Bachmann ] is one of my favorite people .
She is doing just an outstanding job in Congress standing up for what is right .
She ’s got a target on her back .
You need to pray for her and her family . ”
Other groups gathering to make an assault on health care at town hall meetings include Americans for Truth , The Family Research Council and Focus on the Family .
The All of this occurs as more and more people have lost jobs and health insurance and people continue to be excluded from health insurance plans because of pre-existing health conditions .
These issues , however , do n’t seem to be addressed in the Christian right message that declares health care reform as proposed not to be part of God ’s plan and therefore to be rejected .
God and politics are the hot combination in the health care debate .
As Obama was painted by some religious right members as the anti-Christ or worse , now his reform measures are being attacked as against the law of God .
Health care reform is one area of attack , with town hall meetings going on all over the country .
But what do they say about why God does n’t want people to have health reform ?
This is the message from Jean Markell of Maple Grove–based Olive Tree Ministries who has asked her radio listeners to attend congressional town hall meetings and directed to “ to there and give them an earful .
The ideal thing to do is to to go to their town hall and read them the riot act — in Christian love — but read them the riot act on this issue of health care . ”

She is doing just an outstanding job in Congress standing up for what is right .
She ’s got a target on her back .
You need to pray for her and her family . ”
The Minnesota Family Council says that Obama ’s plan for health care reform is against God ’s design and , according to its president , God has created government to do certain things .
When we reject
His design for government , in a sense , we ’re rejecting Him . ” Pritchard goes on to explain that Obama expects people to trust government , not God and socialist models are against the laws of God and involve rationing and waiting periods for care .
The Christian Coalition of America has a similar message , warning Christians about Barack Obama ’s health care program as alien to God and Christian teachings .
They maintain “ that reform of health care would “ provide care to illegal aliens , while rationing care to elderly and disabled American citizens . ”
This pits seniors against immigrants in the health care reform debate .
They also declare on their webpage , “ Stop the takeover .
Visit our action center .
” Other groups gathering to make an assault on health care at town hall meetings include Americans for Truth , The Family Research Council and Focus on the Family .
Focus on the Family specifically requests members to attend town hall meetings and “ demand that abortion funding be explicitly excluded from any reform bill .
” The American Family Association tells its members to keep the pressure on : “ Do n’t let the liberal left silence you !
The future of our country and our children and grandchildren is at stake .
” All of this occurs as more and more people have lost jobs and health insurance and people continue to be excluded from health insurance plans because of pre-existing health conditions .
These issues , however , do n’t seem to be addressed in the Christian right message that declares health care reform as proposed not to be part of God ’s plan and therefore to be rejected .

TCA Jump - Ahead : “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ”
It occurs to me that , although I ’m trying my best to cover the TCA tour in a chronological manner , there are some panels that you ’d like to know about more quickly than I might otherwise get to them .
As such , I ’m instituting a new category called the TCA Jump - Ahead .
First up : “ Curb Your Enthusiasm . ”
It ’s kind of a running joke in the entertainment industry about how every season of “ Curb ” should be considered the last season of “ Curb ” until Larry David says otherwise …and , generally , Larry David is glad to tell you that he ’s done , he has no more ideas , and he ca n’t be bothered to try and think of any .
Thankfully , David announced last year that he would indeed be moving forward with a seventh season of the cringe - worthy comedy ( and I mean that in the best possible way ) , and since then , there have been multiple rumblings about how various members of the cast of “ Seinfeld ” would be popping up .
In the “ Curb ” panel yesterday , David finally provided some context to exactly how they ’d be appearing .
“ For years , I ’ve been asked about a ‘ Seinfeld ’ reunion , as has Jerry and the other cast members , ” explained David , “ and I would always say , ‘ No , there ’s no reunion .
There ’s not going to be a reunion show .
We would never do that .
It ’s a lame idea . ’
And then I thought , ‘ But it might be very funny to do that on ‘ Curb . ’
And I kept thinking about the idea .
I started to think of different scenarios and how we could pull this off .
I called Jerry , and Jerry was game .
And I said , ‘ Well , I ’ll call the others , ’ and I did .
And we did it .
So we ’re doing a ‘ Seinfeld ’ reunion show on ‘ Curb . ’
We ’re going to see writing .
We ’ll see aspects of the read - through , parts of rehearsals .
You ’ll see the show being filmed .
And you ’ll see it on TV .
“ What will you see ?
You wo n’t see the entire show ; you ’ll see parts of the show .
You will get an idea of what happened 11 years later .
And within the show , it will be incorporated into regular ‘ Curb ’ episodes .
So the cast members will be playing themselves on ‘ Curb ’ while all this is going on .
You ’re not going to see a ‘ Seinfeld ’ show from beginning to end , but you will see parts of the show . ”
And will there be any reference to Michael Richards ’ sordid post - “ Seinfeld ” problems ?
“ It ’s possible . ”
The reunion is scattered through the season , and by David ’s admittedly questionable recollection , the cast will be on five shows , though they wo n’t all be on the five shows .
( “ Jerry ’s on five shows , I think , ” he said .
“ The others will be on at least four .
Maybe one or two of the others will be on five .
I ’m not sure . ” )
The season finale will be about the reunion show and will possibly be an hour long , though David admits that he has n’t finished editing it yet and ca n’t say for sure .
There ’s just one thing , though : anyone who ’s been watching “ Curb ” for the previous six seasons has to figure that the odds look good for Larry – the TV Larry , that is – to somehow screw up this reunion .
“ He might , ” said David .
“ Do you need a staff job for next season ?
My guy might consider wrecking something like that , yeah .
We ’ll see what happens .
My guy could very well wreck it .
I ’m not saying he did … ”
Want a few more tidbits about the upcoming season …?
The obvious : Jeff will be around , Susie will still be giving Larry loads of shit , and Cheryl will be back , of course .
But we ’ll also get to see Larry dating a bit .
( We saw a clip of Larry trying to instigate a sexual encounter with a woman in a wheelchair that was non -stop slapstick . )
There will be several other guest stars during the course of the season – count on seeing Richard Lewis , Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen , Bob Einstein , Vivica A. Fox , J.B. Smoove , Sharon Lawrence , Catherine O’Hara , Meg Ryan , Elisabeth Shue , Christian Slater , and Sherry Stringfield – but the most high - profile during the clips that we saw was Rosie O’Donnell , who gets into a physical altercation with Larry in a restaurant .
“ Rosie O’Donnell was hilarious in the show , really funny , ” said David .
“ She is in episode 5 and she is a riot .
Let me tell you something , she ’s a force .
She is very formidable , physically . ”
Lastly , I wanted to make mention of the very first scene that we were shown .
It showed Larry walking down the street , looking as he always does , and a woman who passes him says , “ Smile ! ”
You can imagine how well the advice goes over .
As it turns out , it was more or less inspired by true - life events .
“ Yeah , that ’s happened to me , ” David admitted .
“ I would walk down the street scowling because something was bothering me , and this happened a number of times where people would just say , ‘ Smile ! ’
It ’s a crazy thing to say to somebody .
Mind your own business !
What if I yelled out , ‘ I just found out I have cancer , okay ?
So shut your fucking mouth ! ”
Good ol ’ Larry .
Man , are we glad to have you back .

In Meat Wagon , we round up the latest outrages of the meat and livestock industries .
UPDATE below .
A bill now circulating in the House , sponsored by Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D. - NY ) , would limit the amount of antibiotics that can be used on factory animal farms .
There ’s good news and bad news on that front .
The bad news :
“ The farm lobby ’s opposition makes its passage unlikely , ” The New York Times reported Monday .
The farm lobby ’s opposition is like that .
But The Times should be more precise : it ’s really the agribusiness lobby –representing a few large companies –that wields power .
Ok , now to the good news : Obama ’s FDA has come out in support of restricting antibiotics .
FDA official Joshua Sharfstein testified at a hearing sponsored by Slaughter that the agency will seek to limit antibiotic use on factory farms .
That marks a sea change .
Until now , the FDA had been silent on the problem of antibiotic - resistant pathogens that develop on factory farms–even as evidence of their existence piled up .
Prevention magazine recently ran a pretty amazing story laying out the importance of the issue .
The piece focused on MRSA , an antibiotic - resistant superbug that now kills more Americans every year than AIDS .
A growing body of research links MRSA to confined animal feedlot operations ( CAFOs ) , where animals receive regular doses of antibiotics .
The U.S. government has ( until Sharfstein ’s testimony ) cravenly ignored the link .
The Prevention article , by Stephanie Woodard , recounts a frightening story I ’d never heard before :
About two years ago , dozens of workers at a large chicken hatchery in Arkansas began experiencing mysterious skin rashes , with painful lumps scattered over their hands , arms , and legs .
Not long after , workers at a nearby slaughterhouse owned by the same company as the hatchery , “ where hundreds of thousands of chicken carcasses are prepped daily for sale , ” began turning up with similar symptoms .
The workers turned out to have come down with MRSA .
No one has died yet ; but some of the workers experience regular relapses .
Let ’s think about this for a minute .
We ’ve got a bacterial brew at the hatchery : thousands of birds in close proximity swapping bacteria while feces piles mount beneath them .
All the while , they ’re fed a steady stream of antibiotics , which kill all but the most virulent and hearty strains .
At the slaughterhouse , we ’ve got workers working rapidly to disembowel and dismember those very birds along fast - moving conveyor belts .
The latter conditions seem perfect for infecting workers with MRSA .
Woodard quotes one slaughterhouse worker :
Even the safety glasses , gloves , and smocks workers wear ( along with upgraded regular cleaning of equipment ) are n’t enough to protect them , says [ the worker ] .
“ We work so fast , we often stick ourselves with knives or scissors and get blood on us from head to foot . ”
When a swelling rose over one of his eyes , he was told he might go blind ; if the infection progressed to his brain , he ’d die .
Woodard checked to see what food - safety authorities had done about the MRSA outbreak .
Regular Meat Wagon readers will not be shocked at what she found :
Did any food safety agency test for MRSA in this plant ’s chickens , which were then sold to the public and served on American dinner tables ?
Did any government organization determine the source of the outbreak ?
Calls to the USDA , CDC , and Arkansas Department of Health yielded a no to both questions ; the poultry company that owns the operation did not respond to multiple requests for a comment from Prevention .
Yet in recent years , studies have found MRSA in retail cuts of pork , chicken , beef , and other meats in the United States , Europe , and Asia .
Now , there are several layers of failure here ; all point to a food - safety system under the heal of a hazardous industry .
Indeed , the industry ’s power is so frightful that the company ’s name is withheld in Woodard ’s article .
A little Google searching turned up an MRSA outbreak in Arkansas associated with a hatchery in close proximity with a slaughterhouse .
It ’s owned by Pilgrim ’s Pride – the world ’s largest chicken packer .
Pilgrim ’s Pride recently slouched into bankruptcy , brought low by a towering debt load and high corn prices .
But the company has no lack of friends in high places .
For example , company leader “ Bo ” Pilgrim is famously cozy with Texas Gov. Rick Perry .
At the ribbon cutting for Pilgrim ’s Pride ’s corporate HQ in Texas a few years ago , Perry strained to find the eloquence–and punctuation –to express the depth of his admiration for the enormous chicken packer .
Bo , one of the things that makes this company great is its history … … because it proves that individuals who dare to dream big … … who are willing to act on their ideas … … and who stay true to their values can accomplish amazing things .
Last year , “ Bo ” shoveled all kinds of cash into Perry - related coffers .
While “ Bo ” and Rick were playing bump - and - tickle , things are less jolly at those Arkansas facilities , as this article from a local Arkansas paper shows .
It ’s too early to tell whether Obama ’s FDA can sufficiently crack down on the meat industry to stop MRSA in its tracks .
But at least the agency is , at long last , acknowledging the problem .
UPDATE : Lest anyone head into the weekend feeling too optimistic about the FDA ’s take on antibiotics and factory farms , here ’s the take of the folks who wrote the book , below find the take of the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming .
Sharfstein had called for the phaseout of antibiotics aimed at promoting rapid growth .
Good start , but not enough .
Here ’s Pew :
While banning the use of antibiotics for growth promotion is an important step forward , we need to ensure that antibiotics are not used to compensate for unsanitary conditions on many industrial farms .
The proposed FDA position does not go far enough in this regard and would allow the continuation of conditions that necessitate the improper use of antibiotics in the first place .
Successful models already exist in the U.S. where millions of animals on large industrial farms can be raised cost - effectively without the routine use of antibiotics .
Congress should pass H.R. 1549 , the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2009 , to ensure that these important medicines work as intended , to cure infections and protect human health .
[ Emphasis added . ]
However , I ’m not convinced that industrial animal farming is possible without routine antibiotic use .
Stuffing animals together over their own shit essentially ruins their immune systems ; antibiotics keep them alive long enough to reach slaughter weight .
The industry ’s very business model may be the root of the problem–fixing it might mean slaughtering the meat industry istelf , and returning to smaller scale , pastured - based meat - production models .
That would mean significantly less meat in our diets .
No doubt , though , H.R. 1549 represents a step forward .
It will be passed –it at all–over the meat industry ’s dead body .
And I mean that literally –sort of .
Hat tip to Maryn McKenna ’s blog Superbug , which should be on every MRSA watchers RSS feed .
Probably the most common response is to point out that our species ' consciousness and should enable us to control , without exception , even these deep - rooted evolved urges .
As one reader put it , " If we can learn not to poop in the office , why ca n't we learn not to have affairs ? " ( paraphrasing )
But some things are beyond ( or before ) learning .
Even Scarlett Johanssen questions the possiblities of , saying , " I do n't think human beings are monogamous by nature .
It 's difficult . "
If one of the most desireable women in the world ( who presumably has her pick of men ) has seen the cracks in the facade of monogamy , the foundation must be crumbling .
Rabbi Shmuley Boteach is the author of Kosher Sex , Kosher , and Shalom in the Home .
He articulates very well what he calls the " fundamental contradiction " between sex and love :
What I do n't understand about sex is the fundamental contradiction it poses to love .
While love deepens with time and shared experience , sex is stifled by relationship and routine .
It seems to thrive most through novelty rather than , through new flesh rather than old love .
Sex is the quintessential expression of love .
We even call it lovemaking .
So , why are so many couples who are so deeply in love with each other , after so many years of being together , utterly sexless ?
Why must couples choose between being lovers and being best friends , between being passionate and being intimate ?
King Solomon proclaims in his famous
Song that there is a love like fire and a love like water , and it seems that one cancels the other out .
The fiery love of sex and erotic passion becomes more and more muted through the more watery love of marital routine , familial patterns , and an increasing number of anniversaries celebrated .
Why can't sex and love go absolutely hand in hand , as they should ?
It always amazes me when people use the word " should " in talking about , as if we choose what to find erotically stimulating .
Do we choose what smells good or what colors soothe our eye ?
Did you " choose " to love Mahler 's 2nd symphony or Exile on Mainstreet because someone told you that you should ?
As German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer pointed out , Mensch kann tun was er will ; er kann aber nicht wollen was er will .
( One can choose what to do , but not what to want . )
Sex , both in its presence and in its absence is all about wanting .
Indeed , absent Viagra , for most men , if there 's no want , there 's no do .
I 'm not so sure that " sex is the quintessential expression of love , " as the Rabbi suggests .
Sure , sex can be a profound expression of love , but there are so many ways to express love .
Many of them far from erotic .
Think about the love expressed in caring for a disabled spouse for example .
Or the love that goes into changing a baby 's diapers day after day .
You get the idea .
Love 's not always about sex , and some of these non-sexual expressions of love strike me as expressing a far deeper connection between two people than a mutual .
This is not to say that sex can not be an extreme expression of love .
It can .
But sexual novelty is too important a part of erotic for most men to be completely comfortable with simply stating that sex is all about love , period .
Sometimes it is ; sometimes it is n't .
In the previous post , I mentioned the Coolidge Effect .
Readers unfamiliar with the concept might be amused by the following story : President Coolidge and his wife were touring a large chicken farm .
Because the president had to attend some meetings , Mrs. Coolidge took the tour first .
Upon entering a large area with hundreds of female chickens but only one rooster , the First Lady commented on the imbalanced ratio .
The tour - guide explained that males would tend to fight if placed together and that one male was enough in any case .
" Really , " she asked , " how many times does that male mate with females ? "
" Oh , dozens of times per day , " she was told .
" Well , when my husband comes through here , be sure to tell him that " she replied .
Later , on his pass through the same room , the president was told of this exchange .
" Interesting , " he said .
" And does the male mate with the same female each time ? "
" Oh no , Mr. President , with a different female each time . "
" I see , " he said , " would you please tell that to my wife ? "
Hence , the Coolidge Effect .
In his classic The Evolution of Human Sexuality , Donald Symons put it memorably , noting that , " Human males appear to be so constituted that they resist learning not to desire variety despite impediments such as Christianity and the doctrine of sin ; Judaism and the doctrine of mensch ; social science and the doctrine of repressed and psychosexual immaturity ; evolutionary theories of monogamous ; cultural and legal traditions that support and glorify monogamy ; the fact that the desire for variety is virtually impossible to satisfy .... "
He goes on , but you get the point : Life would be so much easier for men if they were n't like this , so we can be pretty confident that this is n't a hankering anyone is actively choosing .
The parallel to homosexuality is obvious .
With homophobia still so pronounced in most parts of the world , it 's a mystery how can anyone seriously think millions of people are choosing to be gay .
Take a look at this very funny interview between Stephen Colbert and openly gay congressman Jared Polis for a twisted take on why someone " chooses " to be gay :
http://gawker.com/5339672/stephen-colbert-coaxes-gay-congressman-into-fu...
Without the Coolige Effect urging them toward new sexual partners , the small , isolated bands of hunter / gatherers from whom we 're all descended would have in - bred right out of existence .
None of us would be here now , wondering why familiarity numbs eroticism .
Hybrid vigor is as important in people as it is in tomatoes , so men have evolved to be turned on by the unfamiliar and sexually numbed by sustained familiarity .
Like it or not , there it is .
The incest taboo has deep biological roots .
Married couples often do start feeling like siblings after a while .
How can they not , living side by side day after day , night after night ?
Masters and Johnson and many others have noted that many men complained that sexual monogamy could start to feel a bit incestuous after a while .
Sexual attraction is about bridging distance between people .
Once they are together , the function of this desire has been fulfilled , and like all desires , its satisfaction lessens its intensity .
Perhaps an understanding of why this happens may help couples move beyond blame , , and and begin thinking about how to deal with this extremely common predicament constructively .
After all , let 's remember that sex itself is not a biological necessity : many species do just fine without it , relying on parthenogenesis instead ( virgin birth , essentially ) .
The central purpose of sexual reproduction is to keep the salad tossing and the mixing -- not , as Rabbi Boteach and many others wish , to celebrate or promote love .
Love is the dressing on the salad — something added long after the biology itself came into being .
There can be no doubt it 's a wonderful addition , but love is not an integral nor a necessary part of sexual reproduction .
So , in light of the above , what might we expect to find in long term sexually monogamous heterosexual relationships ?
We 'd expect to find that males were eager for sex with their mates in the first few years , becoming steadily less so as time passed — regardless of how much love existed between the couple or how objectively attractive the woman remained .
They'd be likely to feel confused and shamed by these feelings ; the women likely to feel betrayed and insulted .
Sound familiar ?
Oh yes it does .

By Richard ClarkeArsenal have regained the Emirates Cup. Captain Cesc Fabregas lifted the trophy thanks to a 3 - 0 win over Rangers on Sunday .
Going into the final game , the Scottish champions were the only side who could overtake Arsène Wenger ’s team in the standings .
However they were blown away by Jack Wilshere ’s strike after two minutes and a trademark finish from Eduardo nine minutes later .
The 17 - year - old midfielder also volleyed home a killer third 18 minutes from time .
The brace capped a wonderful weekend for Wilshere .
He was special on Saturday and sublime today – picking Man of the Match awards on each day .
The Englishman could do little more to play himself into Wenger ’s side for the opening Premier League game in a fortnight ’s time .
That , of course , is when the real tests begin .
But this was a solid weekend of preparation and it concluded with Arsenal bringing back their home trophy after a year - long sojourn in Hamburg .
As expected , Saturday ’s bench was Sunday ’s team .
Eight substitutes from the side that had left it so late against Atletico Madrid began this afternoon .
Only Emmanuel Eboue and William Gallas kept their places while Manuel Almunia was parachuted in as keeper .
Mikael Silvestre filled in at centre back and Wilshere was on the right of the forward three .
Meanwhile Fabregas and Fran Merida formed a lookalike Spanish central midfield .
Atletico ’s 1 - 1 draw with Paris St - Germain left Arsenal on top of the Emirates Cup table with five points , one ahead of Rangers .
In effect , this was a play - off for the trophy but all the home side needed was a draw .
It took them less than two minutes to get their noses in front .
Wilshere ’s dummy gave Fabregas space on the right .
His clipped ball into the area was touched back adroitly by Arshavin for the Englishman to bury the ball in the corner from 12 yards via the faltering fingertips of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor .
Arsenal were purring already .
Eduardo nutmegged David Weir to go clear for a split - second before being muscled off the ball .
In the 11th minute the Croatian doubled the hosts ’ advantage with a typical finish .
Arshavin nodded the ball back into the path of Merida who sprayed the ball into the path of Eduardo in the right - hand channel .
The 26 - year - old is one of the Premier League ’s coolest marksmen when his finger is on the trigger .
He chose his moment perfectly and stroked the ball home off the base of the post .
Rangers were a little shell - shocked yet commendably stuck to the game .
However it was telling that the biggest threat to Almunia ’s goal in the first half - hour was when Silvestre miscued a Pedro Mendes cross into the sidenetting .
Merida tried his luck from distance as Arsenal looked to kill the game before half - time .
The 19 - year - old tried to repeat the feat eight minutes from the break but sliced his effort horribly wide .
In truth , those early goals had done the contest no favours .
Arsenal were happy in their comfort zone and Rangers were not really able to penetrate .
Madjid Bougherra did see his shot blocked at the far post by Merida after DaMarcus Beasely had nodded on a corner from Mendes .
However in the dying seconds of the half , Wilshere ’s expert chip had to be hurriedly tipped over by the stretching McGregor .
It was reminiscent of Dennis Bergkamp at his best .
If the youngster continues to develop at this pace then that will become a regular comparison .
Both sides made multiple substitutions at the break but Rangers seemed to benefit to most changes .
Five minutes in , Nacho Novo sent over a low cross from the right and Steven Naismith ’s touch spun off Almunia towards the far post where Alex Song had to make a thunderous block from the onrushing Steven Davis .
However a minute later , Wilshere ’s quick feet conjured himself some space just inside the area but his curling shot flew wide .
Rangers had not given up the game .
Just after the hour , Naismith sent Davis racing clear on the right .
The Irishman repaid a pass back to the Scotsman but Almunia saved with his legs and Silvestre ’s clearance was handled by Novo .
However Arsenal put the game to bed with 18 minutes left .
Substitute Sanchez
Watt won the ball on byline and Ramsey crossed for the fast - approaching Wilshere to prod a volley into the top corner .
Kenny Miller fired wide in the closing minutes as Rangers began to look a little ragged .
In response , substitute Ramsey stung McGregor ’s hands from distance .
It had been decent entertainment and even better work - out for Arsenal .
They had also gained a little silverware too .

Amazon recognized this difficulty and has created a plug - in for the Eclipse IDE called AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) Toolkit for Eclipse .
But do n't let the term " plug - in " fool you : I went into this evaluation expecting a single little dialog box with a few minimal features .
I was pleasantly surprised to find full integration of AWS into Eclipse , providing complete control over managing remote instances , uploading code , running code remotely and even debugging remotely without leaving Eclipse .
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse currently supports two aspects of AWS - EC2 ( Elastic Compute Cloud ) management and SimpleDB management .
With the EC2 management , you can configure your servers and debug remotely .
With the SimpleDB management , you can graphically define your SimpleDB domains , items and attributes .
To use the AWS Toolkit , you need to be set up with an account on Amazon AWS .
Once you are , Eclipse includes a dialog box letting you enter your account information .
Once you have all the information entered , you 're ready to go to work creating your project .
You can do the whole thing locally , creating your servlets and testing them out against your own copy of Tomcat .
When you 're ready to try it out remotely , you can configure and manage your servers without ever leaving Eclipse .
Then you can easily deploy your software to the AWS infrastructure , run it and even debug it locally .
According to Amazon , this is just a first step .
But , from what I 've seen , it 's a huge first step .
Amazon officials say they 're going to support more than just Tomcat in future releases .
This is definitely a good thing , considering that Tomcat is technically a reference implementation of the Java servlet architecture and that many people might prefer to run their software on larger application servers hosted within the AWS infrastructure .
Still , Tomcat is excellent , and running it under AWS should n't pose any real problems .
AWS is n't free , but it 's not very expensive , and Eclipse , Tomcat and the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse are all free .
So , if you 're eager to build a system that will be hosted in the AWS cloud , it really wo n't cost you much to get it up and running .
And once your cloud - based system is running , you 'll enjoy the benefits of having a Website that 's backed by an incredibly powerful cloud system .
It 's hard to beat that .
More information about AWS Toolkit for Eclipse can be found at aws.amazon.com /eclipse/.
The project itself is hosted on SourceForge at sourceforge.net / projects/aws-eclipse/.

Condé Nast Reshuffles Digital ; No Layoffs Planned
Condé Nast ’s famously Byzantine digital strategy may be getting a little bit easier to understand :
The company ’s Web operations , which had been splintered into two groups , are getting melded into one , which will be run by Condé digital exec Sarah Chubb .
The company plans on announcing the details of the reorg tomorrow , but here ’s the most important one :
The reshuffling wo n’t result in any layoffs , a person familiar with the situation tells me .
That ’s nice for Condé ’s employees , who already went through cuts last fall .
But it ’s also puzzling :
If merging all of Condé ’s Web operations into one group does n’t eliminate a single redundancy , then what does it do ?
Perhaps not that much .
AdAge ’s Nat Ives , whom Condé briefed on the move , explains the upshot :
Some things also stay the same .
Condé Nast Digital will handle day - to - day contact with digital advertisers , but the Condé Nast Media Group retains the lead on most relationships .
The magazines ’ high - powered publishers are n’t getting any new incentives to sell digital .
And everyone remembers that print still brings in almost all the revenue ; digital absorbed at least its fair share of staff cuts that concluded 2008 .
But Condé
Nast executives point to the recession to explain why it ’s finally found religion .
‘ This economic experience that we are going through has sobered us up considerably , ’ [ Condé Nast CEO Charles ]
Townsend said .
‘ To get back to double - digit growth , we have to put our digital assets to work hard .
I am hoping that the print business will recover to double - digit growth , but I am convinced that the digital business will grow exponentially . ' ”
The problem here is that unlike Time Warner ’s ( TWX ) Time Inc , Condé only has a few properties , liked Wired.com , that have enough scale to attract digital advertisers .
Most of the ones associated with magazine titles , like Gourmet.com , VanityFair.com , etc. , are simply too small to register .
And as long as Condé remains a magazine publisher that happens to have some Web properties , it ’s hard to see how that will change .

Before getting into the actual process , let ’s look at a couple of real - world situations that explain why you may want to turn your home computer into a web server .
Situation # 1 . Say you have music MP3s , documents and other important files on the hard drive of your home computer .
If you turn this home computer into a web server , you will be able to access all these files from office or any other Internet connected machine including your mobile phone .
Situation # 2 . You have some personal photographs that you want to share with other family members .
You can either upload these pictures online to a site like Flickr or better still , just convert the computer into a web server .
Now you can connect the camera to the computer , transfer the digital pictures to some designated folder and they ’ll instantly become available to your friends and family anywhere in the world .
Situation # 3 . You want to host a website on the internet but the web hosting jargon like FTP , DNS , etc. is way too complex for you .
The workaround therefore is that you setup a web server on your home computer ( it ’s easy ) and then host a website in seconds without spending a single penny on external web hosting services .
Now if any of the above reasons look convincing enough , here ’s how you can convert your Windows , Mac or Linux PC into a web server in less than two minutes - no technical knowledge required .
Download the Opera Unite software and install it .
Congratulations , you are now running a web server on your machine and just need another minute to configure local file folders that you want to share with others over the internet .
Here ’s an illustrated screenshot of the configuration panel - nothing technical here again .
Start the Opera Web browser ( yes , that ’s also you web server now ) and enable the Opera Unite service from the lower left corner .
Now double click the File Sharing link and select the folder whose content you want to share on the web .
Any file or folder inside this folder can now be accessed over the internet - you can either use a public URL or specify a password for private sharing .
The following screencast video has more detailed instructions on how to get started with Opera Unite .
Opera Unite looks pretty useful but there are other services around that can also do pretty similar stuff .
For instance , both PurpleNova and Dekoh Dekstop enable users share content on the Internet directly from the hard drive without having to upload it anywhere .
Update :
It ’s important to note that your computer must be in running state and also connected to the Internet for others to download files and web pages since Opera Unite streams content directly from your machine - it does n’t upload or caches anything to its own servers .
Give it a shot .
KALAMAZOO --
A pregnant cow ran loose at the Kalamazoo County Fair for nearly 45 minutes on Tuesday , knocking over several bystanders and fair officials who attempted to corral it .
One woman was taken to a local hospital as a precautionary measure after being charged by the cow , said Bonna Perrin , the fair 's president .
The 5 - year - old Holstein escaped while fair workers were exchanging it for another cow that had given birth at the Miracle of Birth tent several hours earlier , said Chris Rohwer , a veterinarian at the Sprinkle Road Veterinarian Office who is in charge of the birthing process at the exhibit .
Loose cow at fair
The pregnant cow was to be on exhibit until it gave birth , which is expected during the next several days .
" The cow was pretty excited from getting off the trailer , she saw an opening , and she took her opening , which was kind of over the fence , " he said .
" She tried to jump the fence , in the process took out the controls or the bands on the fence and went out of the tent . "
Rohwer said pregnant cows are very easily agitated and are not used to being handled or around large crowds .
Several fair workers and bystanders were charged by the frantic cow once it was surrounded near the entrance of the grandstand by fair workers and crowds of fair - goers .
Fair workers used a newly born calf to lure the loose cow to a corner near the grandstand and Hazel Gray building .

Kalamazoo County Animal Control and police officers , including members of the Kalamazoo County Sheriff 's Office and the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety , assisted in containing the animal by barricading it with their trucks and cruisers .
The cow stomped around and swung its head for nearly 45 minutes and was finally forced into its trailer after being cornered between the grandstand fence and the Hazel Gray building by fair workers and law enforcement .
" She was probably as happy as a clam to get back in that trailer , " said Mike Moreland , president of the 4 - H Livestock Superintendent Association .
Steve Gazdag , a fair board member , was knocked to the ground by the cow while trying to prevent it from running toward the crowded midway area .
" I was n't planning on going out there , but you got to do what you do , " he said .
Rohwer said a tranquilizer could have been used on the cow but that the situation had n't reached a point where it was necessary .
A tranquilizer also could harm the unborn calf , he added .
The cow did not return to the exhibit after it was caught and was not injured , Rohwer said .
Perrin said pregnant animals will be transported at night from now on so that they do n't become spooked by the cheering crowds during the day .
An epidemic of mortgage defaults and foreclosures is threatening the economic recovery .
The problem is serious and getting worse .
More than three million homes are now in serious default ( nonpayment for 90 days or more ) or foreclosure , nearly double the number a year ago .
Sales of properties in foreclosure or serious default made up one third of all home sales in May and June .
Despite a slight uptick in house prices in some markets recently , the sales of foreclosed properties continue to dampen house prices and weaken banks ’...
This latest ad has managed to shake even our most jaded “ This is China ” hearts .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservative party on Tuesday urged Israel not to build more settlements , warning it risked political suicide if it continued to do so .

In unusually strong comments for a German politician , Ruprecht Polenz , the head of parliament ’s Foreign Affairs Committee , was quoted as saying Israel ’s aim of having secure borders would only be possible with a two - state solution .
If Israel did not stop building settlements it ran the risk “ of gradually committing suicide as a democratic state , ” Polenz told the Rheinische Post daily .
Enjoying safe borders would only be conceivable for Israel if East Jerusalem could operate as the capital of a Palestinian state , said Polenz .
But he added Israel was trying to cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank by building more settlements .
“ Israel is overlooking the fact that neither Palestinians nor Arab states will agree to a solution without East Jerusalem , ” Polenz told the paper .
German politicians , who feel they have a special obligation to the country due to the Nazi Holocaust in which six million Jews were killed , tend to be softer in their criticism of Israel than many other countries .
Separately , European Union president Sweden urged Israel to refrain from evicting Palestinians and demolishing their homes in Arab East Jerusalem , where thousands are threatened with displacement .
A U.N. report in May said some 1,500 demolition orders were pending for homes built without a permit from Israel ’s Jerusalem Municipality in the east of the city .
The Swedish president said such actions were illegal under international law and called for them to end .
“ These eviction notices follow other recent orders which adversely affect Palestinians living in East Jerusalem and , combined with the increase in settlement activity in East Jerusalem , further threaten the chances of peace . ”
Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital , including East Jerusalem which it captured in an 1967 and annexed in a move not recognized internationally , and which Palestinian want to make the capital of their own future state .

ALAMEDA —
The USS Hornet was on hand 40 years ago to pick up the Apollo 11 astronauts after their Columbia Command Module splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 , 1969 .
Today , the aircraft carrier is preserved as a museum in Alameda , California .
Its main deck is littered with historic warplanes and space artifacts including an Apollo command module and Mobile Quarantine Facility from subsequent missions , pictured below .
The first footsteps the Apollo 11 crew took on Earth after walking on the moon are traced on the deck .
Wired.com recently took a tour from the flight deck to the bowels of this 19 - story ship .
This gallery contains two or three scenes per page of the coolest corners , cables and controls from our visit to this impressive , history - filled vessel .
One of the reasons the USS Hornet was saved rather than scrapped is because it recovered the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia , which is in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum .
The Apollo capsule currently kept on the Hornet , pictured here , is nearly identical to the one that returned Aldrin , Armstrong and Collins safely to Earth .
This capsule was also recovered by the Hornet , after it was launched into space unmanned and used to test the heat shield ’s strength for landing .
The capsule held up so well , NASA decided to put it to a tougher test by dropping it on land .
That exercise resulted in an impressively small dent .
The Apollo 11 crew spent five days in a Mobile Quarantine Facility , like the one pictured here ( an Airstream trailer ) , as the Hornet transported them to Hawaii .
The unit was then lifted by a crane into a plane and flown to Houston where it was hooked up to a larger living space at Johnson Space Center .
“ It was the first time we went to the moon , so there was a whole quarantine issue , ” said museum curator Pete Sutherland .
“ They thought , maybe there were germs up there that could wipe out all life on earth . ”
The Apollo 11 MQF is in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum , but this one on the USS Hornet is the only one of the four built that visitors are allowed to step inside .
This one was used by the Apollo 14 crew .
“ The NASA scientists were looking for something that would fit for all their particular parameters they needed for it to work , and it just turned out that Airstream had something that was pretty much already there , ” Sutherland said .
Richard Nixon famously welcomed the astronauts back from outside the MQF on the USS Hornet .

The aircraft carrier has four huge cables used to catch the tail hooks of landing planes to slow them down .
The cables are controlled by arresting - gear engines , which could be adjusted for the calculated weight of each plane plus its load .
If the resistance was too hard , the tail hook could snap off ; too soft , and the plane would keep going .
The engine pictured here was actually for the safety net that would catch planes if all else failed .
There are several Peanuts characters painted on the USS Hornet , including Linus and his security blanket .
The message reads , “ I ’m here for security . ”
Curators of the Charles Schultz Museum in Santa Rosa , California recently visited the Hornet to photograph the murals .
Some of the paintings are X - rated , however , and wo n’t be included in the exhibit .

This is a brief statement followed by personal accounts detailing the events of a controversial disruption that happened at the end of the CrimethInc.
Convergence in Pittsburgh this July .
These texts have been written by some anarchist people of color who participated in the convergence and were present the night of the disruption .
There has been some discussion about it on the internet , but we hope to offer people more context from our perspectives about that night .
Still , mostly questions remain about how to proceed .
Hopefully at least , these accounts will provoke honest , open , humble conversations about all of the issues raised , so that we can figure out how to move forward as radical communities in struggle .
There is so much ground to cover to convey what happened throughout the weeklong convergence .
Check back soon for further reportbacks about the rest of the convergence .
Brief Statement
What seemed like an awesome , performative disruption — a reclamation of space , an expression of anger , an opening up of dialogue — shifted quickly into something else entirely .
At the end of a night of Cabaret at the CrimethInc .
Convergence in late July , about half a dozen anarchist / autonomist people of color — some who had participated in the convergence all week and some who came into town just for this “ action ” — stormed into a hall full of people , reading a statement about gentrification and white supremacy , while screaming slogans .
People watched in silence , uncertain of how to respond to such intense aggression from this small group of friends .
With no provocation , the disrupters * started grabbing people ’s backpacks and sleeping bags and throwing them out into the hallway , under a rallying cry of , “ Get the fuck out of here !
Get the fuck out of Pittsburgh !
We ’re not fucking kidding ! ”
They cleared people ’s bags from the shelves , from off the ground ; they grabbed lamps , chairs , anything they could get their hands on .
Tossing everything out of the room , people ’s belongings were dumped into jumbled piles everywhere .
The disrupters screamed that white people were gentrifying the neighborhood the Convergence was in — neighborhoods everywhere — and that they would n’t stop what they were doing until all of the white people from the convergence were out of the building , out of Pittsburgh .
It was the middle of the night , and almost everyone had been staying in that building .
With nowhere to go , many people started to leave .
The disrupters became increasingly aggressive with the people in the room .
They got up in people ’s faces , and yelled at them to leave , “ Go back to Europe !
I ’m sick of looking at your white fucking face ! ”
Provoked into fear and panic , many people left the room , tears streaming down their faces .
Others responded with a variety of racist comments demonstrating just how far a lot of people have to go in terms of understanding white supremacy and privilege .
The disrupters used thinly veiled intimidation and threats , like screaming , “ Get the fuck out of here !
I am not a pacifist ! ” while pulling bags out of people ’s hands ; they muscled past the people who tried to block the flow of backpacks and purses out into the hallway , thrusting the belongings into people ’s heads , backs , and other parts of their bodies .
In an attempt to deescalate the situation , people eventually started encouraging everyone to leave .
Convergence attendees poured out onto the sidewalks , and started organizing alternate housing and carpools .
Many people ’s belongings were still lost and strewn all over the convergence space , but with the police arriving to investigate the scene , everyone had to go somewhere .
By nearly 2 am , all of the people who did not identify as people of color — and all those too traumatized by the aggression of the disrupters — were out of the upstairs , yet the disrupters still refused to leave .
Some people of color from the convergence called a caucus with the disrupters , but after an unproductive attempt at dialogue , finally , the disrupters left .
Apparently , a few friends of the disrupters had known about the planned disruption beforehand , but afterwards , everyone apologetically explained that they had expected the disruption to have a radically different character .
Some people mentioned the feminist disruption of an anarchist gathering in the UK where women hijacked a meeting to screen a movie about feminism when describing what they had imagined .
We certainly hope people would have intervened if they had foreseen the aggression and violence the disrupters chose to employ .
— from people of color who attended the convergence and oppose the disruption
* We are referring to this group of people as “ the disrupters ” because the only way they referenced themselves was as people from APOC ( anarchist people of color ) .
However , they were certainly not acting on behalf of all APOCers .
And like with any decentralized group structure , when a few people do fucked up things under a banner that many people feel affinity with , those people risk delegitimizing the whole movement rather than bearing the responsibility for their own actions .
To be clear , this disruption was NOT an APOC action .
Account 1
It seemed really complicated for many people of color who were not a part of the disruption to sort out their feelings about it that night because it was all too easy to relate to the legitimate anger and distress that seemed to motivate the disrupters .
I talked with many other people of color that night about our own feelings of isolation , the pain of our own invisibility organizing in anarchist spaces dominated by people with more privilege .
We talked about the intensity of the white supremacy we have faced in radical circles , and the serious need to address it .
But we also talked about the ways the kind of coercive actions taken by the disrupters could obscures those realities , making it harder to actually work through this stuff with our potential allies
For me that night , though , it was simple to sort out what side I was on .
Watching the disrupters tear apart people ’s belongings , it was clear I had to intervene .
Watching male - bodied disrupters scream into the faces of women with tears streaming down their cheeks , I had no choice but to put my body in between them .
Really , watching the disrupters of any gender bring their rage upon my white friends of any gender , it was impossible not to get involved .
I am a small , woman of color .
I have been assaulted — physically , sexually , emotionally .
My whole life .
The hatred in the voices of the disrupters as they screamed the absurd , “ Go back to Europe , ” was simply too reminiscent of the xenophobic slurs I ’ve heard since childhood .
The way they manipulated and controlled individuals and groups , screaming threats and rampaging through the room , felt just like life with my abusive ex-housemate .
I will never watch that kind of violence and do nothing .
Even if nothing that I did that night was useful , it was important to me that the disrupters could feel my opposition ; it was important to me to resist .
Because people wanted to take seriously the concerns that the disrupters brought up , it also seemed really complicated for white people to figure out how to engage with them .
Eventually , following the lead of people of color , some white folks started to passively resist the disrupters by blocking the doorways and removing stolen bags from the disrupters ’ hands , but because the disrupters were anarchists , comrades , friends , no one wanted it to be a needless confrontation .
But the disrupters made it clear to me that they were there for a confrontation .
“ This is war , ” they told me .
“ People get hurt in revolution . ”
“ We are not afraid , and we are not pacifists ! ”
For some reason , though , the disrupters had decided that their conflict was only with the white people at the Convergence .
They consistently screamed at every white person to leave , while leaving the people of color alone , and so the people of color left in the space were uniquely positioned to try to deal with the mess .
The disrupters tried to argue that it was n’t about us — it was n’t about the people of color left in the space .
But for me , if you fuck with people I love , even if you never do anything to me , than , yes , your fight is also with me .
I spent much of that night trying to get the disrupters to leave .
I tried to talk to them .
I tried to stop them from destroying people ’s personal belongings .
I put my body in between them and other people — tried to stop the yelling and screaming , faces inches away from each other .
I tried to stop the fight .
I tried to physically remove individual disrupters from that space .
I tried desperately to stop the fight .
That night I felt so alone .
So isolated .
It was clear to me that I needed to resist the abuse that was happening .
But I did n’t want to be fighting these people that were trying to say everything I also needed to say .
I should have been standing along side the disrupters , we should have been speaking our fury together , but they made that impossible .
The disrupters made no space for dialogue .
They made no space for me — or other people of color who needed room for their rage .
They told us all that we could talk later .
When everything was over .
But even now , everything is far from over .
We tried to reason with the disrupters , to get them just to leave .
I asked them how they felt about how shitty they made people feel , and they quickly defended that they “ gave people warning ” to leave .
( That warning was them entering the room yelling and throwing people ’s bags out . )
Another disrupter responded , “ Do n’t you support queers bashing back ? ”
And I told them , I ’m all for queer people — anyone , really — attacking their attackers , but that I did n’t equate that with indiscriminately attacking a room full of strangers .
I asked them how they felt about all of the women , queer people , trans people , and otherwise marginalized people they were pushing out onto the street in the middle of the night .
The disrupters responded that they ’d be safe wherever they had to go because of their white faces .
Back and forth , we tried to get the disrupters to respond genuinely , but they gave up only rhetoric and nonsense .
After literally hours of this , after every bag was cleared out of the room , after almost every person was gone and the disrupters were just standing inside of one of the doorways , refusing to leave , I totally broke .
With nothing left to do , I told them all to get out .
I told them it was over , it was time to go .
They just looked at me .
I had been saying this all night , but this time I needed it to be real , I needed it to be done .
I was done .
I went behind the door that two of them were leaning against to hold open and started pushing with all my strength to close it .
It closed halfway , and then the struggle really began .
I do n’t remember everything that happened .
The disrupters were screaming at me .
I was screaming at them .
Tears were screaming down my face ; every muscle in my body cried out .
At some point other people of color started helping me push on the door .
Everything hurt .
Everything was pain .
Everything was broken .
That night , you broke me .
I am crying still as I write this one week later .
All of the complicated pain and heartbreak wo n’t let go .
I want to be talking about white supremacy in our movements .
I do n’t want to be talking about you .
I do n’t want to be watching us self - destruct , taking sides , falling apart .
I want to be talking about the ways our privilege and internalized oppression make us hurt each other .
I guess that ’s what this is , but it all feels so needless , so thoughtless .
I do n’t want to deal with your shit just because you did n’t think through your actions , because you thought that everyone would just come back in after you left , that all of the panic attacks and pain could just be erased , that when people ’s hearts stopped racing they would n’t feel the lingering fear .
Somehow , there was a moment of stillness when everyone else was gone , and some people of color called for a conversation with all of us , the disrupters and all of the other people of color that were left .
We closed the doors to that upstairs room , and everything was quiet for a moment .
Folks of color started trying to ask the disrupters about why they did what they did , trying to reason with them .
It felt pointless to me .
The disrupters were spouting the same rhetoric and absurd defenses they had been saying all night .
They expressed feeling good about displacing people for the night because they wanted people to get a taste of how gentrification displaces people permanently .
When I asked how they felt about being a force of domination , just like gentrification , they responded only that gentrification is a greater force of domination than they were that night .
I ’m glad at least that the disrupters were less of a force of domination than gentrification , but that sets the bar pretty low for how we interact with one another .
Even oppressed groups of people can dominate people with more societal privilege than they have .
People also brought up how dangerous and irresponsible it was for the disrupters to do something that could bring so much extra police attention to this political event .
With the high level of surveillance of the convergence , the police certainly could have taken advantage of this opportunity to raid the space or otherwise intervene .
Perhaps that did n’t happen only because with some kind of intelligence on the inside , it was clear that the disrupters were doing a better job of creating division , panic , and controversy than the police or Feds could have .
Someone later said to me that if the police had raided the space , it probably would have brought people together against the police , but this kind of drama will ensure schisms far wider - reaching and longer - running than anything the police can do to us .
In this conversation with the disrupters , we also tried to talk more specifically about why they did what they did .
From this vantage point , I honestly think that the rhetoric about gentrification was somewhat of a ruse for the aggression .
None of the disrupters were from Pittsburgh .
Three of them had arrived that day and not spent any time in that neighborhood .
They claimed that the neighborhood did n’t want the convergence there , but in our conversation , they could n’t offer a single story about talking to a neighbor with complaints .
Whereas I had dozens of interactions with people in that neighborhood who were ambivalent to excited about the convergence being there — and I know many others did , too .
I met neighbors who were curious about what we were doing , neighbors who offered us food , neighbors who helped out with copwatch , and neighbors who came to the convergence space to hang out .
When further pressed for information about why they were taking that action , the disrupters said that they came there only because they were asked to do this by “ Pittsburgh APOC . ”
According to one APOCista in Pittsburgh , there is n’t an active APOC group there , but it seems like a couple of individual APOC folks likely asked the group to come .
When asked again to try to defend why they were acting they way they were , the disrupters explicitly said that anyone could hold “ Pittsburgh APOC ” accountable for their actions .
The disrupters said also that they were acting with the full support of Chicago and Philly APOC , as well as people in Milwaukee .
I want to make it abundantly clear that supporting this “ action ” is not just supporting a militant action taken by people of color ; it is supporting abuse .
Using intimidation , threats , controlling people ’s belongings and their movements is violence .
The violence people of color feel in their daily lives and in anarchist circles is real and legitimate , but that in no way justifies this indiscriminant use of violence among friends and potential allies .
It ’s like a woman , who distraught at the expression of patriarchy in her every day life , forces herself on her lover .
It is fucking abuse , and we should n’t ignore it just because it ’s complicated .
As for what happens next , I ’m not sure .
The way the disrupters acted is a totally unacceptable way to treat comrades or potential comrades , and the only model I have for sorting out how to move forward through this is some kind of perpetrator accountability process — although , that kind of accountability can only happen within communities of friends .
That night , the disrupters said they would n’t call any of the white anarchists there comrades , and maybe that is something they want to stick by .
For now , I know that I do n’t want to organize with or interact with those disrupters until some kind of serious accountability process can take place .
That night was intensely triggering for many people .
For me .
For hours , I was under this consistent , medium level attack .
I came out of that night with cuts and bruises , torn clothing and trauma that one week later , still wo n’t relinquish my body back to me .
I do n’t get to be neutral or pretend it did n’t happen .
I hope we all take this seriously .

I am puertorican .
I too am fed up with the subtly alienating sub-culture of CrimethInc. and many other radical spaces with their ignored hierarchies and cold , individualist behaviors .
If it were entirely up to me and if I had no one to care about in the convergence , I would ’ve probably grabbed bags just the same and screamed just as loud .
But liberation is not that simple , and thank goodness it is n’t , or else a flashy vanguard might ’ve been all it took for the oppressed all along .
And we ’re definitely not into that vanguard bull after seeing the harm it ’s done ( … right ? ) .
Watching the disruption unfold and the split widen in the main room was like watching my own family fight with each other .
I do n’t know which side I should take or if there are sides to take , and that made me feel all the more powerless .
You ’d think that watching fellow APOC act in autonomy and against white supremacy would make me feel emboldened to take further action … but I felt I could n’t do anything else but to sit there frozen and try to take all the surfaced conflicts in by force .
I do n’t know if it ’s just a trigger of mine to freeze up in these situations , or if I was just plain afraid to join anyone .
Some people ’s faces looked like that of white tourists back in PR who just got their luxurious vacation ruined .
Some of the disruptors were completely ignoring the triggers the violent behaviors in the space set off for many with an abused past .
At a point where I was feeling the crack too much , I pleaded to speak to a disruptor face - to - face .
The reasoning for the action was much of what I expected : fed up APOC who want to teach a lesson the loud way .
As I listened on , it started to sound like some individual disruptors were n’t all that sure about their action after all .
While on the sidewalk a squad car raced by with sirens blasting and sped off .
I thought to myself that the infiltrators must be laughing their asses off about this back at the station .
I spoke then with a Latino friend that came back on the bike who was glad that finally people were taking this convergence seriously .
Yea , true , it did wipe out a lot of the rose tint , but it could also create a whole new blindfold .
After the conflict settled down , the disruptors were outside and I confronted the loudest of them ( at least ) who explained they were acting as individuals ( so much for their talk about white people oppressing the nearby neighborhood , apparently they were n’t speaking on their behalf ) and talked about some history of these POC groups and mentioned a very troubling term : “ anarcho - nationalist ” .
The fact that “ anarcho ” and anything that means could ever be related to “ nationalist ” is confusing enough , but I find the simple upholding of “ nationalist ” to be fucked up .
Puerto Rico ’s nationalist groups , though greatly mythologized , have their own history of very , very fucked up shit in the name of national power for the “ puertorican ” so many people still revere .
From Albizu Campos ’s correspondence with Nazis to constant and still going talks of “ cleansing ” the puertorican culture ( whatever our culture is , anyways , esos son otros veinte pesos ) , nationalist goals did n’t exactly conjure the liberated , autonomous communities we all strive for .
I talked with people of all sorts of contrasting experiences and conversations during the disruption but there ’s a very unique one that I wish to share .
Shortly after finally calming down and walking without trembling , a male - bodied person who I had only met briefly before approached me .
They asked for advice .
They were part of the organizing for the disruption but completely changed their mind at a moment they felt no identity .
The person was of mixed - race .
They did n’t identify as a person of color though because of their experiences of having just as much privilege as any white person but in other ways , like class and gender .
And their skin was light , and complexion could be judged as white as well .
Did that mean they were gentrifying and oppressing just as much as white people ?
Neither of us knew an easy answer .
But to me , it does show that gentrification is n’t as simple as just race , as I myself have many privileges that could be easily ignored were I to take a quasi-nationalist stance based on race ( I am male - bodied , middle - class , and my Americanized upbringing in the colony , including knowing the language well , has made it easier to be “ accepted ” in North American “ culture ” ) .
And also , we need to be constantly evaluating what it means to be a “ person of color ” and what role do both , our apparent and our identity race / races play as oppressor or as the oppressed .
On my ride back from the convergence , I thought to myself of how it could ’ve ended if there were no disruption .
Maybe internalized white supremacy would ’ve gone ignored .
Maybe , after all , we could ’ve finished the conversations in something productive and concrete .
We ’ll never know and it ’s actually unproductive to think of whether or not it was necessary .
It made cracks and it create some bonds while shattering others .
It got a ball rolling or at least made the ball bigger on confronting our own spaces ’ racism .
It hurt some people and caused some damage that a mere “ sorry ” wo n’t help .
It brought out some fucked up statements ( some random person claimed “ you ca n’t kick me out , this is MY space ” … ) .
If anything , let ’s not ignore what discussions need to happen face - to - face , whatever side we were on .
No causing a mess within own friends and then leaving the city like nothing happened ( is n’t that what we blame so many corporations and cops so much for ? ) .
I want to speak with all y’all and make honest connections .
Anarchist people of color are all I have , because we reflect the complexities I need to confront so badly and need help with , in a world that enforces a single “ normality ” .
And I sure as hell do n’t just wanna impose some other kind of simple and separatist “ normality ” .

There is a lot to be said as far as I am concerned around the disruption that happened during the CrimethInc .
Convergence , but maybe this is not the forum in which to say it all .
This is a short ( relative to everything I want to say ) account of my experience around the disruption .
When the disruption started , I did n’t really know how to respond .
In its beginning it seemed that the disruption was a performative protest against issues involving gentrification around the convergence , a more rebellious show that is a part of the cabaret , something that was done more to make a point than anything else .
Very soon it became clear to me that the disruption was aimed towards something else entirely .
In the days before the disruption I was emotionally exhausted by several mediation processes I was involved in , and specifically by work around gentrification .
When the disruption started I had no emotional capacity to take in any of what was going on .
I stood there , watching friends try to stop the disruption , taking bags and belongings out of the disrupters ’ hands , without the ability to react or to get involved .
Someone approached me and asked me to get involved , to do something , but I could n’t .
If I am really honest , even though I was protected by my identity as a person of color , I did not feel safe .
I had a personal relationship with some of the disrupters , but not with the two most aggressive ones .
I actually felt that an intervention from my side might end with a punch to my face .
A white friend of mine was sitting in the corner crying , and I went to them and hugged them , trying to give them support .
Their tears and sadness brought my emotions to the surface .
I felt overwhelmed by the sadness that came with the recognition that apparently we can not all just get along .
Even though we are a part of a movement , it seems like some of us feel like aggression is the only way to get results from our comrades , and there is something so heartbreaking about that .
While me and a friend were comforting another friend , one of the disrupters came to us and asked if we were going to leave .
The other comforter replied rather cynically , “ Well , I am Colombian , is it ok for me to stay ? ”
The disrupter , not noticing the tone in which the words were said , replied that we could stay .
When I think about the disruption I keep going back to that moment .
There is something so ironic in the disrupter approaching a group of mostly people of color with a request to leave .
When you are at war , maybe there is no space for distinctions — and so people of color turn into white as you assume everyone around you is the enemy .
And even if we were n’t people of color , it seems so heartless to approach people in tears you caused in order to promote your interests .
At that moment the disrupters made it clear , some vague political idea was more important than us , the people who sat with them in gentrification workshops all week .
A few moments later one of my white friends approached me and offered me a hug .
I do n’t remember exactly what they said to me , but there was something in their words that felt liberating .
Through the whole disruption I felt so dehumanized , as if I was erased , completely unpresent and unrecognized .
The contradiction that such a friendly moment offered helped me suddenly notice the dehumanization I felt for so long .
This was a bitter - sweet experience .
Soon after I went downstairs .
There I was again greeted by many concerned friends offering hugs and asking what I needed .
I left the space a little later , I felt drained and worried and wanted to be in a space that felt safe .
The day after I felt very concerned about going back to the space .
I was worried that the conversion about yesterday ’s events will focus mostly on the fucked up way in which the disruption took place , and not enough on the feelings that motivated it .
To me the disruption was mostly a wake up call , and I wanted others to take it as such .
Happily , I think that most of the particles of conversations that have reached my ears were focused on the breach of trust people of color felt towards their white allies .
After the really really free market we all met and went through an accountability process around some racist reactions some white people had towards the disruption .
The process caused me to feel a lot of anxiety .
In the moments before it I took many emotional supporting tinctures , and drank tea .
I was scared of how I would feel about the things that would be said , and was worried I would not have the capacity to contain myself .
The beginning of the process was very frustrating for me .
There was a lot of discussion around how the process should go , what people can or cannot say , etc .
To me , a lot of the discussion seemed like an attempt to evade the actual accountability that needed to be taken .
My feelings about the conversation shifted completely when we actually started going through the list of racist reactions to the disruption .
I was surprised by the fact that people actually admitted when they did not know why something was wrong or offensive .
Things were not just brushed under the carpet , but each act was examined by the whole community and explained .
The strongest part of the process was when people actually stood up and identified themselves as the ones who took some of the offensive actions , and recognized their mistakes in front of the whole community .
It felt like a very deep process started in that conversation , one that will hopefully have long term affects on our community as a whole and on each of us as individuals .
To me , this proves that we have the potential to protect each other and fight for one another .
I can get you to think about my oppressions without breaking you .
I guess that the main things I am left with from this experience are questions about the integrity and honesty that we have towards one another .
Throughout the convergence I was closely involved with some of the attempts to confront the convergence ’s gentrifying effect on the city .
Often , it seemed like those attempts were very constructive and successful .
After hours of conversations on this subject , I felt like we were getting somewhere .
From my post - disruption perspective , I am not too sure what to think about those conversations now .
Some of the disrupters participated in those conversations , and I am left to wonder what their intentions were in doing so .
A part of me fears that they used those conversations in order to have a one - way conversation , in order to educate others as to their feelings around gentrification without really trying to come to a resolution around the problem .
I want to believe in the honesty of the dialogue we had , because doubting it will have heartbreaking consequences for me , but at the same time , I do not want my naiveté to help anyone get off the hook too easily .
I think that I am standing in a unique position towards what has happened .
I have close personal relationships with the convergence organizers and some CrimethInc. writers , and at the same time I am a person of color who understands the rage of the disrupters and often feels disappointed with white “ allies . ”
In many ways , I feel I am in the middle of this .
Throughout the convergence I heard some of the disrupters ( as well as others ) criticize CrimethInc. , critiques I shared as well .
At the same time I was surprised .
My experience with having the exact same conversations with individuals who are involved in CrimethInc. or the convergence have always been positive .
I ’ve always found listening ears to my difficulties , and have always received invitations to step in and create space for what I want and need .
When I tried to convey these feelings to others they replied that they would not participate in a dialogue because it would be fruitless .
This despair is actually based on legitimate past experiences , and it is so depressing .
I hope that people will take the disruption as a sign as to how people of color specifically feel in this community .
There is a huge breach of trust when it comes to how we respond to white supremacy .
So many times in the past this community has not responded to abusive or oppressive individuals , and now many of us feel like other anarchists do not have our back .
How are we supposed to stand together against the threat of prison time or pepper spray , when we do n’t stand together in front of the mirror ?
I need this community to have a very clear zero tolerance policy towards oppression .
I need us all to make it very clear to each other that we are in this together .
I expect nothing less from us .
I hope the disrupters know what they ’ve done .
I hope they understand they have torn this community apart .
And now , I do not know how to go back home , how to deal with friends who are traumatized , how to think about my identity as an anarchist person of color , what to do with one of the disrupter ’s phone number that is still in my phone book , how to deal with “ friends ” who have supported your action .
Now , I am not traumatized , because this fucked up shit has broken my heart to a point where I have no space to be traumatized .
I have no space to feel anything .
Our identity as people of color is meaningless when your actions bring tears to our eyes .
Maybe it will seem rude or inappropriate , but I have but one thing to say : fuck you .
Maybe you should consider the struggle as a two - way road .
For me the disruption is a wake up call to how we communicate with each other as a community , around white supremacy as well as other issues .
We need to cut each other some slack and take more leaps of faith .
We are all a part of a common struggle for liberation , and maybe we need to trust that others will be interested in hearing what we have to say and go through an accountability process with us when needed .
It is something that is hard to do , but assuming that other anarchists are fundamentally on our side will help us create a stronger community .
The alternative is what brought the disrupters to play an abusive role towards others .
Admitting that we do not share common interests and in fact do not function as a community is something I am not willing to even consider at this moment .

Account 4
The account below is a personal , partial , and situated perspective on the disruption that took place at the 2009 CrimethInc Convergence .
I claim to be speaking on behalf of no one except myself , although I am speaking from the position of a queer woman of color who attended the convergence , participated in the APOC caucus that took place at the convergence , and was present during and after the disruption .
Here is my account of what happened .
Although I cannot claim to be more “ right ” than anyone else , I can try to offer an honest perspective .
About a week has passed and here I sit , trying to sort through notes , thoughts and feelings , but feeling little motivation to pull it all together because what gets written here will just be one piece amidst the War of Representation which has already begun .
But something needs to be said ; because there are people out there claiming to be speaking on behalf of APOC and people of color in general , and it needs to be known that they are not speaking on behalf of me .
It needs to be known that although I share the rage , frustration , and hurt felt by the “ disruptors , ” I do not agree with their actions .
Not only because white people were hurt and forced onto the streets without warning , but because other people of color were hurt and felt silenced by the disruptors ’ actions .
I ca n’t talk about the disruption without first talking about the shit I was feeling and all the things that happened leading up to disruption .
I woke up on the same morning as the disruption thinking , I need to get out of Pittsburgh .
Something about the space felt alienating — I did n’t know many people there , conversations often felt dishonest and polarized , and I was often the only woman of color in various workshops .
I felt small and unmotivated to speak .
It would be unfair to say that an atmosphere of hostility toward people of color is what caused this feeling .
Although I did hear racist comments get thrown around by a small group of ignorant folk , it was largely the result of being outnumbered by white boys , and feeling like there was no place or entry point for my perspective .
The morning of the disruption I sat waiting for a discussion on cultural appropriation to begin .
I sat next to another person of color , who later was a participant in the disruption .
They engaged me in conversation and we exchanged contact information .
It felt good , especially after feeling invisible for much of the convergence .
When they asked me how I was feeling at the convergence , I started crying and quickly left the room .
Later that day the APOC caucus met .
The discussion revolved mainly around the issue of gentrification , and racism / alienation in the radical community .
Toward the end of caucus I started crying again , and walked back to the convergence space with another woman of color .
We had an awesome conversation , and she asked me if I wanted to be the MC at the Cabaret , which was the event happening that evening .
At dinner I talked briefly with another person from the APOC caucus , who later was a participant in the disruption .
Although an action / intervention had been planned , nothing was mentioned to other APOCers during the caucus .
A few people from Philly , who were not at the caucus , met in private with a few people at the convergence who were in on the plan , but other APOCers were intentionally excluded .
So I was one of the MCs at the Cabaret , the event that was taking place when the disruption happened .
When the last planned act finished , the outburst happened .
The disruptors started yelling at white people to get the fuck out , screaming “ We ’re not fucking kidding !
We are not pacifists ! ” A person of color from the caucus came up to me and whispered , “ Are you with us ?
Help us get people ’s bags out of here . ”
This is what really pissed me off .
What the fuck was I supposed to do ?
These people did not attempt to talk to me at all , left no room for dialogue with other folk of color and yet expected us to join their action .
When this person asked me to join I felt pressured to choose allegiances .
In some ways , I did feel like it was my “ duty ” as a person of color to participate in the “ eviction , ” but at the same time I knew that what they were doing was fucked up — that the indiscriminate eviction of and aggression toward white people ( many of whom were survivors of abuse and queer , trans , and womyn identified ) was not okay .
So I did not participate .
But part of me felt guilty .
Because I shared their rage toward racism , but felt alienated by their tactics and exclusionary approach .
It should be known that none of the people who actually participated in the eviction were from Pittsburgh .
Yet the rhetoric used by the disruptors was a rhetoric of extension , and by this I mean that people who declared war on the white people at the convergence were claiming to speak on behalf of “ the neighborhood ” and people of color in general .
I felt infuriated by the sense of entitlement and arrogance of the language used during the eviction , because when you speak on behalf of other people you essentially silence them .
And I know from talking to other people of color that many other perspectives were silenced by the action .
Although the “ smack a white boy part 2 ” statement released by the disruptors framed the others as the aggressors , what actually took place was a two - way aggression instigated by this small group .
Emotions were fucking high .
Yelling , pushing , and offensive comments were exchanged back and forth between white people and the disruptors , people of color and the disruptors , white people and white people .
The chaos went on for what must have been a couple hours .
Eventually , it was just a few white people and a group of people of color from both sides .
One of the last white people in the room was an arrogant white boy who was acting cocky , making inappropriate comments , and sitting shirtless on a chair .
I yelled at him to get the fuck out of the room , and he left .
Some fighting took place between people of color and disruptors and they made it clear that their war was not with us ( other folk of color ) .
They told us we could stay , but when they were asked to leave by a woman of color as some fighting was happening , those who were people of color not participating in the action were called “ Obama , ” a race traitor , and accused of siding with the oppressors .
One mixed person was accused of siding with “ the part of him that was a colonizer . ”
The conflict among people of color was starting to really wear me down emotionally .
Both sides did not want to talk .
I started to cry as people were pushing on both sides of a door and asked if we could sit down and have honest conversation about what was happening .
A few of the disruptors knew from the caucus how alienated I had felt that day , but I made it clear that I felt equally alienated by their actions .
I could tell by the look on the faces of the disruptors that they genuinely felt bad about this , that their intention was not to hurt other people of color .
When I asked them why they excluded myself and others from discussion about the action , one person said “ We did n’t tell X and X because we knew they would n’t approve , and we did n’t tell you because we did n’t know if you ’d be with us . ”
This approach and the intentional exclusion of people who may disagree seemed suspiciously vanguardist to me , especially when acting on behalf of APOC .
When participant and non-participant people of color finally sat down to talk , the first thing I asked was , “ Is anyone here actually from Pittsburgh ? ”
Sadly , not one person was .
Here we were , arguing about the feelings of a community that was not ours , and I wondered , why do we feel entitled to speak and act on behalf of a neighborhood we are not from ?
The whole thing felt embarrassing and insincere .
But that ’s not to minimize the issue of gentrification .
What kind of impact would a 6 - day convergence have on a neighborhood ?
How did the neighborhood residents feel about the outsider presence ?
I imagine the response was varied and incapable of being reduced simply to positive or negative .
When I walked around I smiled and spoke with people , one person offered me help as I was fixing my bicycle , another person asked me if we ’d be coming back next year .
But who knows , maybe my personal positive interactions with locals was the result of also being a person of color who does n’t look particularly punk .
I know there were also concerns raised about increased police presence , and this is definitely a legitimate concern .
But a meaningful and productive response to the issue of gentrification is not one sheathed in dishonestly and dogma .
Over a week later I sit here contemplating the significance of it all , besides feeling slightly traumatized and drained .
I feel somewhat disillusioned with our capability as people of color , as anarchists / anti-authoritarians / autonomists , to speak from a place of honesty and not ideology , to act on an ethic of care and not entitlement , to let our rage be known without alienating the people we claim to be fighting for .
I feel angry about what took place ( both the disruption and the response of some white people ) , confused about my allegiances , but ultimately , I ca n’t hate the people who participated in the disruption .
Because these are the same people who had reached out to me earlier that day as I sat alone feeling invisible , the same people I ’ve talked to at other APOC caucuses , the same people who share my disdain for white supremacy , the same people I will probably be fighting with in the future .
But there needs to be accountability taken for how their actions rendered other people of color invisible , and hurt both ally white folk and people of color .

After the Obama administration announced an investigation into the CIA ’s interrogation tactics , both Dick and Liz Cheney returned to the Sunday morning talk shows .
On ABC’s This Week Liz Cheney continued to claim that waterboarding is not torture , while over on Fox News Sunday , Dick Cheney continued to endorse torture .
Here is Dick Cheney courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Cheney said , “ Chris , my sort of overwhelming view is that the enhanced interrogation techniques were absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives , in preventing further attacks against the United States , in giving us the intelligence we needed to go find al Qaeda , to find their camps , to find out how they were being financed .
Those interrogations were involved in the arrest of nearly all of the al Qaeda members that we were able to bring to justice .
I think they were directly responsible for the fact that for eight years , we had no further mass casualty attacks against the United States .
It was good policy .
It was properly carried out .
it worked very , very well . ”
Host Chris Wallace asked Cheney if he was comfortable with cases where the CIA went beyond their legal authorization , and he said , “ I am . ”
Here is Liz Cheney courtesy of Media Matters :
Liz Cheney said , “ You guys have misstated the standard here for a legal investigation , here , and I would point you to Andy McCarthy ’s excellent piece in National Review online which goes through what the standard is that the Justice Department should have applied here which is the notion that you need evidence that you can move beyond the presumption of innocence in a court of law that torture occurred . ”
Fellow panelist Sam Donaldson said , “ Everyone , except one person , that I know of prominence thinks waterboarding and torture is wrong . ”
Cheney replied , “ Waterboarding is n’t torture and we can go down that path . ”
Interestingly the one unnamed person that Donaldson was referring to was Liz ’s Daddy former vice president Dick Cheney .
Their father / daughter act today once again demonstrated how dangerous the Cheney ’s are to the Constitution .
Liz Cheney talks about presumption of innocence for torturers , but does not believe that the same presumption applies to detainees , while her dear old dad believes that it is for CIA interrogators to violate the law .
You might be thinking wait a minute detainees do n’t have constitutional rights , but running secret programs and withholding information from Congress is a violation of the constitution .
Plus if the Cheney ’s believe that is constitutional to torture , it is a small step towards claiming that torture for American detainees is also legal .
What the Cheneys did today was engage in Operation Keep Dick Cheney out of Prison .
Dick and Liz Cheney are hurting their party every time they go on national television and defend torture .
The last thing that the GOP needs is for the American people to be reminded of the previous eight years , but the Cheneys do n’t care about the GOP .
They are only interesting in saving Dick Cheney ’s hide .
People who 've been using Catalyst and DBIx :: Class for a while will have noticed we have a strong commitment to backwards compatibility - DBIx :: Class has been doing its best to avoid breaking running code since version 0.03 and Catalyst 's commitment to compatibility has been in place since around version 5.50 , also from the end of 2005 .
This commitment means that I 'm extremely confident ( having a very good idea which features will be deprecated eventually and making sure we do n't cover them ) that the Definitive Guide to Catalyst will continue to lead people to writing working code for at least two years and hopefully longer - even if it wo n't always teach people how to write the best code of the day ( unless we get a second edition , of course :)
There 's a lot of debate about how much we 've slowed ourselves down by doing this , how much perl itself has slowed itself down , and whether this has been a worthwile decision overall .
Obviously I 'm on the " worthwhile " side of the argument , but that does n't mean I believe in maintaining compatibility forever .
Across major releases features move from " normal " to " deprecated " to " warning loudly " to " gone entirely " , as we refactor underneath and find clearly better ways to provide features .
However , the change to these new features is always provided as evolution , not revolution - you can keep your old code and implement newer code using the new shiny just fine , and if older features are n't any trouble to maintain then we may not even bother removing them - just undocument them so that people stop using them for new code without causing any trouble to people with perfectly working code that just happens to use them .
Of course , then when they need to modify that code they 'll find there 's no docs anymore and that may make them think about moving just as well .
The most important thing though is to provide a migration path - a way for users to get from the old to the new without wanting to shoot themselves in the face with a shotgun .
Deprecation warnings should reference the documentation for this , and it should be as extensive as possible .
So when Sebastian Riedel , the original founder of the Catalyst project ( who left not long after 5.50 due to technical differences between him and the rest of the core team ) , posted about changes to his new Mojo framework , I had to have a look .
The Mojo team has " prepared a detailed changelog with instructions , and I 'm going to reproduce the relevant parts here , with notes and my thoughts about how things could easily have been done a little differently .
0.991250 2009-08-18 00:00:00 -
This release contains many substantial changes that are not backwards compatible , but good news is that it's also the last major feature breaking release before 1.0 . ;)
0.991246 -> 0.991250 ... what ?
How do you change huge amounts of code at that version ?
At the very least call it 0.999000 or similar .
And of course the changelog indicates there were no dev releases , which would have given people a chance to test their apps beforehand .
Older releases of Mojo did contain additional Mojo :: Script ::* and Mojolicious :: Script ::* modules that are obsolete now and might break this version if they are still present on your system .
Because of this we highly suggest that you DELETE ALL MODULES IN THE " Mojo " , " MojoX " AND " Mojolicious " NAMESPACES MANUALLY !!!
Well , why not just do a version check of old modules and ignore them ?
Or at least make sure that ' make install UNINST=1 ' does the right thing - or provide a script to check for such old modules and provide ' rm ' invocations to remove them .
Having an upgrade make even new applications written to the new standards potentially not work seems insane to me .
- Mojo:: Script has been renamed to Mojo : : Command , this change is not backwards compatible !
You will have to regenerate application scripts or replace " Mojo( licious ) : : Script " with " Mojo( licious ) : : Command " manually .
Or you could just have shipped Mojo :: Script : : empty modules that loaded the real ones while emitting a warning that the application scripts needed to be regenerated or modified - Catalyst has long used a script versioning system so we can warn the user if they 're running an old one ( I 'm fairly sure in fact that Sebastian wrote it - so I can't see any reason at all for not doing something similar again ) .
- Removed unused features from Mojo : : Base and simplified API , this change is not backwards compatible !
__PACKAGE __-> attr( ' foo ' , default => ' bar ' ) ; becomes __PACKAGE __ -> attr( foo => ' bar ' ) ;
So check if @_ has the extra member and emit a warning telling the developer to change - it's a couple lines of code to do that and prevents every single class file in their project potentially breaking at once .
- Merged eplite and epl , this change is not backwards compatible , you will have to rename all your eplite templates to epl .
I 'm sure there 's a reason for this .
I 'm sure there 's a perfectly good reason they can't simply pick up two file extensions - or even * shock * make the extensions configurable so somebody can use .html as the extension if they want to .
But I cannot for the life of me work out what it is .
- Simplified MojoX :: Renderer , this change is not backwards compatible !
Handler can no longer be detected , that means " default_handler " or the " handler " argument are required .
The template argument can no longer contain format or handler .
$ self ->render ( template => ' foo.html.epl ' ) becomes $ self - > render ( ' foo ' , format => ' html ' , handler => ' epl ' )
Because clearly one regexp , a warning , and an option to turn it off would be too hard .
Though I guess this explains why you could n't use .html before ... still does n't give me any idea why it can't be now .
And it goes on - more renaming of things without stubs for the old names ( and since every class should pass the empty subclass test , if that does n't trivially work there 's something else you need to fix anyway ) .
For added bonus fun , they appear to have removed their per-request context object entirely and switched to using controller base classes for customisation purposes instead .
I 'm not going to criticise this last one since it seems like a change that would be extremely confusing to try and keep compatibility across , but it 's buried half way through the Changes and seems like it could do with a write up on how to switch .
I just do n't understand this .
I think everything I 've described here would be maybe a few dozen lines of extra code - but a huge decrease in the amount of pain inflicted on the user base .
To quote a couple of people who were around when I first went " what the ... " at this -
" could n't he have done that at more like 0.3 ? "
" T EARLY ADOPTERS : GO FUCK YOURSELF " " I understand there are reasons to rewrite your entire framework and fuck over your users that you sold down the river , but that is pretty extensive " " That is Crazy Eddy insane . "
Guys .
You 're selling yourself as being a good way to get beginners into perl .
How many beginners are going to handle trawling through @INC and deleting .pm files manually ?
How many beginners are going to read a goddamn Changes file ?
We can do better than this , and it is n't hard .
All you have to do is think a little about how your users are going to get from A to B , and get your code to guide them gently in that direction .
Those few dozen lines of migration path code will save you a lot of support questions and you can use the time saved to do something more useful - and you can take them out after a few releases once the majority of people have upgraded anyway .
Old features do n't need to be forever , but if your users are scared to upgrade then they 'll never see the new ones .
Backwards compatibility as far as you can is good , but migration paths are way more important .
And that way you get more people testing and patching the latest release rather than the legacy code - and that 's important too .

A new update for Titan Studio ’s Fat Princess is on it ’s way , the developer confirmed .
The update will fix problems gamers have been facing since it ’s launch .
The first update for Fat Princess will be fixing the multiplayer component , as some users have reported on lag , and not even getting in online games .
Lag
Players are sometimes experiencing significant lag in some games .
Thanks to your feedback , we ’ve identified a specific problem and already have a fix in testing .
The matchmaking system will randomly pick potential servers bases on a number of criteria .
As implemented , the results that are returned are fit in some regards , but sometimes have a high ping for your location .
As a result , some players may be having a great experience , and others dealing with substantial lag .
Leaving a particularly laggy game and joining a new one may result in a better experience .
Unfortunately , it can be luck of the draw .
The fix we have in testing returns a list of potential servers in such a way that it always favors the lowest available pings .
Connection Fixes
We have implemented a number of fixes for previously identified problems , focusing most of our efforts on connection failures .
We have already tested this patch on our own client machines , and performance appears to be dramatically improved .
We are working with Sony now to get the patch into the Sony testing process as soon as possible .
For those of you having trouble – thanks again for your patience .
Fat Princess went through comprehensive testing with Sony in the US and Europe , and a beta , but these issues did not manifest until the game went live at scale .
Rest assured , we ’re working on it , and think we have it largely addressed .
Stay with PlayStation LifeStyle for all Fat Princess news .

( CNN ) --
An 11 - year - old Ohio boy is helping ease his family 's financial burdens , one toy at a time .
Zach McGuire wants to do his part while his family goes through hard times , so he 's selling his toys .
Zach McGuire is selling his toys to raise money for his family , which like others across the country , has bills piling up and a home in jeopardy .
The youth said the idea came up during a conversation with his father .
" You can't live in toys , or eat toys , " he told CNN television affiliate WNWO .
" Even though they are fun , you do n't need them . "
Zach plans to use the proceeds for a good cause : helping his unemployed father .
Tom McGuire , a licensed contractor in Toledo , Ohio , has not had a job since December .
The economy is partly to blame , he said , adding that he did a job last summer and never got paid .
As the general contractor on the job , he said , he was financially liable for materials and the work of two subcontractors .
" I 'm out $ 30,000 , " McGuire said .
The father said he is looking for work and is not relying on money from his son's toy sales .
But he appreciates his effort .
" Zach has a big , giving heart , " McGuire said .
" He came to me with this idea .
He wants to contribute . "
Watch how Zach McGuire is helping his family »
It 's not the first time Zach has helped those in need .
In 2005 , he sold Kool - Aid for victims of Hurricane Katrina and raised $ 400 .
A few years later , it was " Cocoa for California , " which he sold to help wildfire victims .
" I am very proud of him , " McGuire told WNWO .
" He is an 11 - year - old boy not living the life of an 11 - year - old . "
Zach said everyone can do something .
" Even though they do n't feel like they could do anything , they could do a Kool - Aid stand , like me , " he said .
" It 's what you 're doing that matters and how you 're helping people . "

As the debate rages on about whether Internet addiction is a discrete affliction , the first US treatment center designed to treat it has opened its doors .
The Heavensfield Retreat Center has launched a program called reSTART located in Fall City , WA , which offers a 45 - day treatment program for Internet Addiction Disorder ( IAD ) .
The cost to go through with the program is $ 14,500 , and enrollment has already begun .
Interest in the phenomenon of Internet addiction started to peak 2006 , with papers , surveys , and studies coming out to discuss the disorder .
One paper published in Perspectives in Psychiatric Care said that it affected between five and 10 percent of all Internet surfers , while a survey at Michigan State University that said nearly 20 percent of students had withdrawn from a course or had experienced grade problems due to excessive use of the Internet or computer games .
Another study attempted to find out more about the behaviors behind IAD , and an editorial in the American Journal of Psychiatry argued that Internet and gaming addiction should be added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) V , the handbook of mental disorders used by mental health workers in the US .
This concept is not without criticism , however .
The American Medical Association first made a similar recommendation in 2007 , only to be followed by a reversal of that position .
Opponents of adding Internet / gaming addiction to the DSM deny that there are complex neurophysiological elements analogous to dependence on pharmacological agents such as ethanol , nicotine , or heroin , despite research to the contrary ( at least in male subjects ) .
Clearly , however , the Heavensfield Retreat Center is taking IAD seriously with its new program .
reSTART offers counseling with professionally - trained staff , group therapy , vocational coaching , 12 - step meetings , recreational activities , " high adventure " outings , health and fitness programs , and volunteer service .
This is in addition to psychiatric assessments , medical treatment , scholastic tutoring , and career guidance .
As pointed out by Mashable , you must qualify for reSTART by displaying symptoms of IAD , which include a strong impulse to use the Internet , withdrawal symptoms without it , a reduction in other interests or social activities as a result of the Internet , and an impairment of everyday life .
Of course , with a $ 14,500 price tag attached to the treatment , detractors are sure to come out of the woodwork arguing that reSTART is just taking advantage of lost souls .
The program 's webpage argues that the cost is fair , however , and is actually lower than most 30 - day inpatient programs .
With some people trying to use IAD as an excuse for poor work performance , reSTART and other programs like it may eventually become as commonplace as drug and alcohol counseling .

US Debt : A Fist Full of Trillions
Bill Bonner here at The Daily Reckoning pretty much nailed the problem when he said that “ During the 2001 - 2007 period , credit in the United States increased by $ 22 trillion .
The nation ’s GDP increased only by $ 4 trillion . ”
The ugly result was that , dividing one into the other , “ For every extra dollar of output , Americans took on $ 5.50 of debt ” which is the same as me stupidly taking a part - time job in addition to my regular job when I hate working my regular job because I hate working , just to make a few extra dollars because all of my income from my regular job ( which , if you remember , I hate ) is already used to pay debts , and then I used this “ extra income ” to borrow 550 % of the extra income !
Hahaha !
Now , I admit that “ total national credit ” and “ Gross Domestic Product ” are pretty difficult concepts of the kind that have no meaning to a guy like me just trying to get enough money together to buy some gasoline and maybe a couple of tacos , a fact made more difficult by the fact that GDP is now , in July 2009 , stuck at $ 14 trillion , and which now supports total debt of around 300 % of GDP , which means that total public and private debt is a staggering $ 42 trillion , almost doubled from 2007 !
And in the meantime , non -farm payrolls have been stuck at 131 million the whole time since 2001 !
As I am finishing pumping the gasoline into my car , I notice that he is only talking about a 6 - year period , yet in that time , this means that 140 million total workers in this country took on ANOTHER $ 157,142.87 in debt !
Each !
EACH !
My trembling hand gingerly shook the last few precious drops of gas from the nozzle into my tank , like some bizarre scene from the movie Mad Max , as some economic facts flashed into my mind , and I mused out loud , “ You know , the national debt on January 1 of 2001 stood at $ 5.663 trillion , whereas on January 8 , 2007 it stood at $ 8.667 trillion .
So only $ 3 trillion of that $ 22 trillion in additional credit came from the profligate deficit - spending federal government in those 6 years !
Yow ! ”
My wife , waiting in the car , suddenly wants to know how come I can remember those old facts and figures , but yet I ca n’t ever seem to remember the dates of our wedding anniversary or the kids ’ birthdays ?
The answer , of course , instantly flashed into my mind , and I thought to myself , “ The reason , you old bat , is that such crushing federal debt , especially now that it is being monetized by the filthy Federal Reserve creating the money and credit to buy the gobs of government debt , is Very , Very Important ( VVI ) , and if you had any idea what that kind of rampant money creation is going to do to ruinous inflation in consumer prices , and thus do this country , and do to you and those bratty kids you are always yammering about , then you would not compare such monetary and fiscal stupidities to the scant importance of the birthdates of some idiot kids that nobody ever heard about and who will probably end up marrying badly and living their entire lives in some incomprehensible , hellish Theater of the Absurd , just like their cursed father !
Oh , Death , where is thy sting ? ”
But , older and wiser , I did not say that out loud , and I just pretended that I did n’t hear her , continuing ominously , “ If the socialist / commie - think federal government only borrowed and spent $ 3 trillion in those 6 years , who borrowed and spent the other $ 18 trillion ? ”
My thinking was that this question would generate some thoughtful discussion about the Austrian school of economics , which agrees that massive increases in the money supply is a Bad , Bad Thing ( BBT ) , or maybe bring up a reference to Milton Friedman , who correctly said that “ Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon ” upon which she which would contemplate and come to the correct conclusion , which is that we need to buy as much gold and silver as we can , to protect ourselves against the guaranteed damage to the buying power of the dollar from all of this monetary and fiscal malfeasance and malversation , and to hell with the kids and their damned birthdays !
Alas , it was not to be .
Instead , it only generated a lot of yelling about how I am the worst husband and father in the whole world , which then generated a lot of other voices in my head screaming , “ We ’re freaking doomed ! ” because I know for a fact that the national debt is now , a lousy two and a half years later , over a whopping $ 11.600 trillion , which is a few trillions more !
Trillions !
Like I said , we need to buy as much gold , silver and oil as we can , and doing anything else would be another Big Stupid Mistake ( BSM ) , a phenomenon which most of us have made too many times already , making the buying of gold , silver and oil that much sweeter .
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !
Rahm Emanuel was only giving voice to widespread political wisdom when he said that a crisis should never be " wasted . "
Crises enable vastly accelerated political agendas and initiatives scarcely conceivable under calmer circumstances .
So it goes now .
Here we stand more than a year into a grave economic crisis with a projected budget deficit of 13 % of GDP .
That 's more than twice the size of the next largest deficit since World War II .
And this projected deficit is the culmination of a year when the federal government , at taxpayers ' expense , acquired enormous stakes in the banking , auto , mortgage , health - care and insurance industries .
With the crisis , the ill - conceived government reactions , and the ensuing economic downturn , the unfunded liabilities of federal programs -- such as Social Security , civil - service and military pensions , the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , Medicare and Medicaid -- are over the $ 100 trillion mark .
With U.S. GDP and federal tax receipts at about $ 14 trillion and $ 2.4 trillion respectively , such a debt all but guarantees higher interest rates , massive tax increases , and partial default on government promises .
But as bad as the fiscal picture is , panic - driven monetary policies portend to have even more dire consequences .
We can expect rapidly rising prices and much , much higher interest rates over the next four or five years , and a concomitant deleterious impact on output and employment not unlike the late 1970s .
About eight months ago , starting in early September 2008 , the Bernanke Fed did an abrupt about - face and radically increased the monetary base -- which is comprised of currency in circulation , member bank reserves held at the Fed , and vault cash -- by a little less than $ 1 trillion .
The Fed controls the monetary base 100 % and does so by purchasing and selling assets in the open market .
By such a radical move , the Fed signaled a 180 - degree shift in its focus from an anti-inflation position to an anti-deflation position .
The percentage increase in the monetary base is the largest increase in the past 50 years by a factor of 10 ( see chart nearby ) .
It is so far outside the realm of our prior experiential base that historical comparisons are rendered difficult if not meaningless .
The currency - in - circulation component of the monetary base -- which prior to the expansion had comprised 95 % of the monetary base -- has risen by a little less than 10 % , while bank reserves have increased almost 20 - fold .
Now the currency - in - circulation component of the monetary base is a smidgen less than 50 % of the monetary base .
Yikes !
Bank reserves are crucially important because they are the foundation upon which banks are able to expand their liabilities and thereby increase the quantity of money .
Banks are required to hold a certain fraction of their liabilities -- demand deposits and other checkable deposits -- in reserves held at the Fed or in vault cash .
Prior to the huge increase in bank reserves , banks had been constrained from expanding loans by their reserve positions .
They were n't able to inject liquidity into the economy , which had been so desperately needed in response to the liquidity crisis that began in 2007 and continued into 2008 .
But since last September , all of that has changed .
Banks now have huge amounts of excess reserves , enabling them to make lots of net new loans .
The way a bank or the banking system makes new loans is conceptually pretty simple .
Banks find an entity that they believe to be credit - worthy that also wants a loan , and in exchange for the new company 's IOU ( i.e. , loan ) the bank opens up a checking account for the customer .
For the bank 's sake , the hope is that the interest paid by the borrower more than makes up for the cost and risk of the loan .
The recently ballyhooed " stress tests " on banks are nothing more than checking how well a bank can weather differing levels of default risk .
What 's important for the overall economy , however , is how fast these loans are made and how rapidly the quantity of money increases .
For our purposes , money is the sum total of all currency in circulation , bank demand deposits , other checkable deposits , and travelers checks ( economists call this M1 ) .
When reserve constraints on banks are removed , it does take the banks time to make new loans .
But given sufficient time , they will make enough new loans until they are once again reserve constrained .
The expansion of money , given an increase in the monetary base , is inevitable , and will ultimately result in higher inflation and interest rates .
In shorter time frames , the expansion of money can also result in higher stock prices , a weaker currency , and increases in commodity prices such as oil and gold .
At present , banks are doing just what we would expect them to do .
They are making new loans and increasing overall bank liabilities ( i.e. , money ) .
The 12 - month growth rate of M1 is now in the 15 % range , and close to its highest level in the past half century .
With an increased trust in the overall banking system , the panic demand for money has begun to and should continue to recede .
The dramatic drop in output and employment in the U.S. economy will also reduce the demand for money .
Reduced demand for money combined with rapid growth in money is a surefire recipe for inflation and higher interest rates .
The higher interest rates themselves will also further reduce the demand for money , thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures .
It 's a catch - 22 .
It 's difficult to estimate the magnitude of the inflationary and interest - rate consequences of the Fed 's actions because , frankly , we have n't ever seen anything like this in the U.S .
To date what 's happened is potentially far more inflationary than were the monetary policies of the 1970s , when the prime interest rate peaked at 21.5 % and inflation peaked in the low double digits .
Gold prices went from $ 35 per ounce to $ 850 per ounce , and the dollar collapsed on the foreign exchanges .
It was n't a pretty picture .
Now the Fed can , and I believe should , do what it must to mitigate the inevitable consequences of its unwarranted increase in the monetary base .
It should contract the monetary base back to where it otherwise would have been , plus a slight increase geared toward economic expansion .
Absent this major contraction in the monetary base , the Fed should increase reserve requirements on member banks to absorb the excess reserves .
Given that banks are now paid interest on their reserves and short - term rates are very low , raising reserve requirements should not exact too much of a penalty on the banking system , and the long - term gains of the lessened inflation would many times over warrant whatever short - term costs there might be .
Alas , I doubt very much that the Fed will do what is necessary to guard against future inflation and higher interest rates .
If the Fed were to reduce the monetary base by $ 1 trillion , it would need to sell a net $ 1 trillion in bonds .
This would put the Fed in direct competition with Treasury 's planned issuance of about $ 2 trillion worth of bonds over the coming 12 months .
Failed auctions would become the norm and bond prices would tumble , reflecting a massive oversupply of government bonds .
In addition , a rapid contraction of the monetary base as I propose would cause a contraction in bank lending , or at best limited expansion .
This is exactly what happened in 2000 and 2001 when the Fed contracted the monetary base the last time .
The economy quickly dipped into recession .
While the short - term pain of a deepened recession is quite sharp , the long - term consequences of double - digit inflation are devastating .
For Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke it 's a Hobson 's choice .
For me the issue is how to protect assets for my grandchildren .

In 1949 Joseph Campbell ( 1904 - 1987 ) made a big splash in the field of mythology with his book The Hero With a Thousand Faces .
This book built on the pioneering work of German anthropologist Adolph Bastian ( 1826-1905 ) , who first proposed the idea that myths from all over the world seem to be built from the same " elementary ideas . "
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung ( 1875 - 1961 ) named these elementary ideas " archetypes , " which he believed to be the building blocks not only of the unconscious mind , but of a collective unconscious .
In other words , Jung believed that everyone in the world is born with the same basic subconscious model of what a " hero " is , or a " mentor " or a " quest , " and that 's why people who do n't even speak the same language can enjoy the same stories .
Jung developed his idea of archetypes mostly as a way of finding meaning within the dreams and visions of the mentally ill : if a person believes they are being followed by a giant apple pie , it 's difficult to make sense of how to help them .
But if the giant apple pie can be understood to represent that person 's shadow , the embodiment of all their fears , then the psychotherapist can help guide them through that fear , just as Yoda guided Luke on Dagoba .
If you think of a person as a computer and our bodies as " hardware , " language and culture seem to be the " software . "
Deeper still , and apparently common to all homo sapians , is a sort of built - in " operating system " which interprets the world by sorting people , places , things and experiences into archetypes .
Campbell 's contribution was to take this idea of archetypes and use it to map out the common underlying structure behind religion and myth .
He proposed this idea in The Hero With a Thousand Faces , which provides examples from cultures throughout history and all over the world .
Campbell eloquently demonstrates that all stories are expressions of the same story - pattern , which he named the " Hero's Journey , " or the " monomyth . "
This sounds like a simple idea , but it suggests an incredible ramification , which Campbell summed up with his adage " All religions are true , but none are literal . "
That is , he concluded that all religions are really containers for the same essential truth , and the trick is to avoid mistaking the wrappings for the diamond .
Lucas had already written two drafts of Star Wars when he rediscovered Joseph Campbell 's The Hero With a Thousand Faces in 1975 ( having read it years before in college ) .
This blueprint for " The Hero's Journey " gave Lucas the focus he needed to draw his sprawling imaginary universe into a single story .
Note that the Wachowski Brothers ' wonderful film The Matrix is carefully built on the same blueprint :
Campbell Star Wars The Matrix I : Departure
The call to adventure Princess Leia 's message " Follow the white rabbit " Refusal of the call Must help with the harvest Neo wo n't climb out window Supernatural aid Obi-wan rescues Luke from sandpeople Trinity extracts the " bug " from Neo Crossing the first threshold Escaping Tatooine Neo is taken out of the Matrix for the first time

Luke follows R2 into the Jundland Wastes ; The Millennium Falcon follows a lone TIE fighter into range of the Death Star Neo " follows the white rabbit " to the nightclub where he meets Trinity
Searching For The Hero
Jung and Campbell are n't the only people who have attempted to map the Hero's Journey !
There have been dozens of less celebrated forays into this area , and just about everyone comes to slightly different conclusions .
Notable works include :
German philologist Max Müller ( 1823-1900 ) got the ball rolling with an influential essay called Comparative Mythology , first published in Oxford Essays ( 1856 ) .
According to The Columbia Encyclopedia , " Müller did more than any other scholar to popularize philology and mythology , particularly in his lectures Science of Language ( 1861 , 1863 ) . "
In my opinion Müller 's scholarship was weakened because he proceeded from two basic assumptions without questioning them : ( 1 ) that fairytales were inferior drivel for children , and ( 2 ) that his faith was valid and all other faiths were primitive superstitions .
For instance , Müller was one of the first people to introduce Hindu scripture into Europe , by translating the Rig - Veda .
It was of course unthinkable that the Veda could actually be older than The Hebrew Bible , and anyway the King James Bible says right there in black and white ( in a margin note new to the 1611 edition ) that the Earth was created in 4,004 BCE , so Müller changed all the Vedic dates to suit that " historical fact . "
Eeek !
( It turns out parts of the Veda seem to have been composed before 4,004 BCE .
So the Vedic faith began before the King James version of the Earth even existed .
Müller also wrote disparaging essays about German folktales , which tend to revolve around an idea called poetic irony . )
Müller wrote that the Vedas are mostly " childish in the extreme , tedious , low and commonplace . "
Can a translator really do justice to a work he holds in contempt ?
Müller 's two - volume Contributions to the Science of Mythology ( 1897 ) argued that mythology is " a disease of language . "
J.R.R. Tolkien , in his 1938 essay On Fairy - Stories , countered " It would be more near the truth to say that languages , especially modern European languages , are a disease of mythology . "
In all fairness it 's a bit petty to make fun of Müller for his religious intolerance , particularly since the other 19th - century German academics he hung out with considered him bizarrely respectful of the " silly superstitious beliefs " of non-Christians .
Müller was a brilliant man who laid the foundations for modern Linguistics and Mythology , and he 's still worth reading .
( 1856 ) .

J.R.R. Tolkien , in his 1938 essay On Fairy - Stories , countered " It would be more near the truth to say that languages , especially modern European languages , are a disease of mythology . "
In all fairness it 's a bit petty to make fun of Müller for his religious intolerance , particularly since the other 19th - century German academics he hung out with considered him bizarrely respectful of the " silly superstitious beliefs " of non-Christians .
Müller was a brilliant man who laid the foundations for modern Linguistics and Mythology , and he 's still worth reading .
Englishman Sir Edward Burnett Tylor ( 1832 -1917 ) , sometimes called the " father of cultural studies , " wrote a book called Primitive Culture : Researches into the Development of Mythology , Philosophy , Religion , Language , Art and Custom ( 1871 ) .
His idea was to demonstrate that all religion began with animism ( the belief that everything has a soul ) , followed by polytheism , followed by monotheism .
Tylor 's book became a bit of a scandal because it provided scientific support for the idea that " primitive " peoples were n't inferior to white Europeans .
His work was partially a counter - argument to Müller .

Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn ( 1811 - 1869 ) mapped out a few common elements he found in the Greek and Albanian fairytales he had translated , in his book Sagwissenschaftliche Studien ( roughly " Fairytale Sudies , " 1876 ) .
( roughly " Fairytale Sudies , " 1876 ) .
Alfred Nutt ( 1856 -1910 ) observed a few underlying commonalities of myth from his studies of the Celts , in his The Aryan Expulsion - and - Return Formula in the Folk and Hero Tales of the Celts ( 1881 ) .
He also wrote The Fairy Mythology of Shakespeare ( 1900 ) .
( 1881 ) .
He also wrote ( 1900 ) .
Viennese psychoanalyst Otto Rank ( 1884-1939 ) created an influential Freudian interpretation of the Hero's Journey by analyzing 34 European and Near - Eastern hero stories , in his book Myth of the Birth of the Hero ( 1909 ) .
As you might guess from the title , Rank did n't think much of myths and fairytales .

The Golden Bough : A Study in Magic and Religion ( 1911 - 1915 ) , by Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer ( 1854-1941 ) .
Draws parallels between mythic beliefs of cultures from all over the world .
Frazer 's book is outdated in a few small ways , but is still considered one of the great books of the twentieth century , and for excellent reason : Frazer was the first person in the world to map out the mechanics of what we might call " magical thinking " , the essential building block of mythos ( " sacred story , " Greek ) .
The book makes an excellent argument that magical thinking is one of the primary keys to understanding human consciousness .
Frazer was an enormous influence on Joseph Campbell , Ursula Le Guin and Frank Herbert .
If you nurture ambitions to write , especially to write " mythic " fiction , Frazer 's brilliant book is without question on the short - list of recommended reading .

Russian professor Vladimir Propp ( 1895 -1970 ) published an extremely influential analysis of Russian folktales called Morfologiia Skazki ( " Morphology of the Folktale " , 1928 ) , which identified 31 steps on the hero 's journey .
( " Morphology of the Folktale " , 1928 ) , which identified 31 steps on the hero 's journey .
Lord Fitzroy Richard Somerset Raglan ( 1885 - 1964 ) wrote a very influential book called The Hero ( 1934 ) , in which he identified 22 steps on the Hero's Journey .
His work drew heavily on Frazer 's Golden Bough .

Dutch folklorist Jan de Vries identified ten common elements in the Hero's Journey , in his Forschungsgeschichte der Mythologie ( 1961 , published in English as " Heroic Song and Heroic Legend " 1963 ) .
His ideas seem to be strongly influenced by von Hahn 's work .

French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss ( 1908 - ) was one of the chief proponents of structuralism ( the academic vogue which immediately preceded postmodernism ) .
His Mythologiques is based on an exhaustive analysis of Native American myths , written between 1964 - 1971 .
Lévi-Strauss 's efforts to isolate the " atomic elements " of myth are well - considered and interesting , though his writing style is extremely dense , self - referential and oblique , so you might need to read this book several times to understand what he 's trying to communicate .
I can't say I fully understand his points , but there are many fans of this book who report that all the hard work it requires is worthwhile .
Lucas draws on his Personal Myth 1
In 1949 Campbell called this mythic element " woman as temptress , " but both Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers ( as well as countless others ) have managed to imagine compelling temptations away from the Divine Path which did n't cast woman as the villain .
Campbell 's idea that woman represents divine impurity was probably influenced by his orthodox Catholic upbringing , which shifts the responsibility for Adam 's fall to Eve.
Although Campbell 's book is scrupulously cross-cultural , the one exception is his chapter on " Woman As the Temptress , " which draws examples exclusively from Judeo - Christian myths .

Media Fragments URI 1.0 First Draft Published The Media Fragments Working Group has published the First Public Working Draft of Media Fragments URI 1.0 .
Audio and video resources on the World Wide Web are currently treated as " foreign " objects , which can only be embedded using a plugin that is capable of decoding and interacting with the media resource .
Specific media servers are generally required to provide for server - side features such as direct access to time offsets into a video without the need to retrieve the entire resource .
Support for such media fragment access varies between different media formats and inhibits standard means of dealing with such content on the Web .
Media Fragments URI 1.0 provides for a media - format independent , standard means of addressing media fragments on the Web using Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) .
The Working Group also updated Use cases and requirements for Media Fragments .

WebSimpleDB API First Draft Published The Web Applications Working Group has published the First Public Working Draft of WebSimpleDB API .
User agents need to store large numbers of objects locally in order to satisfy off - line data requirements of Web applications .
Whereas the Web Storage specification is useful for storing pairs of keys and their corresponding values , it does not provide in - order retrieval of keys , efficient searching over values , or storage of duplicate values for a key .
The new WebSimpleDB API specification provides a concrete API to perform advanced key - value data management that is at the heart of most sophisticated query processors .
It does so by using transactional databases to store keys and their corresponding values .

CLEVELAND —
Seven current or former U.S. Postal Service employees and another person are charged with multiple counts of drug trafficking .
They were indicted by a Cuyahoga County grand jury after a yearlong investigation by agents with the Postal Service 's Office of the Inspector General in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County Sheriff 's detectives .
Three more employees were cited for marijuana possession during the investigation that took place at the mail distribution center at 2400 Orange Ave. , where agents confiscated crack , PCP , prescription painkillers , marijuana and a loaded handgun .
Elizabeth A. Farcht , agent in charge of the U.S. Postal Service Eastern Area , said the goals of the investigation were " to ensure employees can work in a drug - free environment " and " deter postal employees from engaging in this type of activity at work . "
Agents said the drug deals occurred at the mail distribution center or were arranged while the employees were on the job .
About 1,300 employees work at the plant during three shifts .
Those indicted are :
• William Booker , 44 , of Streetsboro , a motor vehicle operator charged with drug trafficking and possession .
Accused of selling prescription painkillers , Percocet and Oxycodone , three times , twice near a school .
• Andrew McIntyre , 32 , of Warrensville Heights , a mail handler charged with drug trafficking and possession .
Accused of selling PCP once , near a school .
• Jovon Miller , 29 , of Cleveland , a mail handler charged with drug trafficking .
Accused of selling marijuana twice , near a school .
• Andre Robitson , 20 , of Cleveland , an occasional employee charged with drug trafficking and possession .
Accused of selling crack twice , PCP twice , and marijuana once , all near a school .
• Kenneth Currie , 38 , of University Heights , an occasional employee charged with drug trafficking .
Accused of selling marijuana twice , once near a school .
• Cory Wilson , 21 , of Cleveland , an occasional employee charged with drug trafficking .
Accused of selling marijuana three times .
• Christopher Tatum , 29 , of Cleveland , an occasional employee charged with drug trafficking .
Accused of selling marijuana once , near a school .
• Joseph Grimes , 39 , of Cleveland , is charged with drug trafficking .
Accused of selling marijuana once .
The suspects are also charged with possessing criminal tools — the cell phones used to set up the drug sales .
Selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school or daycare is an enhanced felony .
Robitson was arrested last week .
The others were arrested Tuesday .
Cuyahoga County sheriff 's deputies and a police dog searched employees ' lockers and personal cars May 7 and issued citations for possession of marijuana to James Malokas , 53 , a mail processing clerk ; Bryan Hampton , 51 , a custodian ; and Shelley Benton , 41 , a mail handler .
They were found guilty in Cleveland Municipal Court and fined .
Charges have not yet been filed against the person who had the loaded gun , Assistant Special Agent in Charge Scott Balfour said .
Becoming Chicago
I thought living here made me a Chicagoan .
Not everyone agrees
Think you ’re a Chicagoan ?
Post your qualifications below , and my wife will tell you if you are .
As a kid , I believed that lake Point Tower was sinking into Lake Michigan .
Whenever we passed the building , lurking alone by the water like a black - tinted Godzilla , my father told me so .
“ In a few years , the bottom floors will be underwater , ” he said , and every year we visited the city , Lake Point Tower looked a little shorter .
I imagined a lower - floor resident banging on his windows for help from various lake creatures , and I thought : I want to be that guy .
To my adolescent eyes , Chicago was a majestically weird place , one where residents blamed cows and goats for civic misfortunes , so bizarre phenomena like sinking skyscrapers seemed reasonable .
And awesome .
Someday , I vowed , I would be a Chicagoan .
My wife says I will never be one .
“ You could live in Lake Point Tower the rest of your life and get Mayor Daley ’s face tattooed on your butt , ” says Sarah , a Hyde Park native .
“ And it would n’t matter , because you did n’t grow up here . ”
This draconian standard excludes vast numbers of us , including Chicago ’s five biggest celebrities — Capone , Jordan , Obama , Ditka , and Winfrey — all of whom moved here in their twenties .
Per Sarah , none of the above will ever “ understand ” the city in the way that , say , Mike Royko ( or even R. Kelly ) could .
“ Michael Jordan became who he is as a basketball player here , ” she says .
“ But not as a person .
Chicago is not in his soul . ”
This ca n’t be right .
In my innocence , I assumed I would become a Chicagoan simply by moving here .
Of course , the complicated answer is somewhere in between , an existential conundrum that only deepened when I began to ask everyone I knew : Am I a Chicagoan ?
They usually responded with a question of their own , which , if answered correctly , granted me entry .
Like :
» “ How long have you lived here ? ” Twelve years .
“ After ten , you ’re grandfathered in .
Unless you ’re from Wisconsin — then it ’s 15 . ”
» “ What do the four stars on the Chicago flag represent ? ”
The fire , Fort Dearborn . . . uh . . . deep - dish pizza . . .
“ Stop . Just stop .
Please . ”
» “ Have you shifted your sports allegiance to Chicago teams ? ” Long ago .
“ Do you expect your teams to fail ? ” Always .
“ You qualify . ”
» “ Have you ever been lost in another city and said , ‘ You know , this does n’t happen in Chicago because our streets have the grid system ’ ? ”
Yes .
I ’m really irritating about it .
“ You ’re totally a Chicagoan . ”
» “ Have you voted ? ” Yes .
“ How many times ? ”
You mean in the last election , or altogether ?
“ Well played .
That is correct . ”
» “ If you give a tourist directions , how accurate are they ? ”
Once , I told a woman outside Water Tower Place that the Field Museum was only “ two or three ” blocks away .
“ I cannot in good conscience call you a Chicagoan . ”
» “ How do you feel about the kids banging on buckets with sticks on Michigan Avenue ? ”
May they spend eternity eviscerated by leprosy - oozing horned demons .
“ You ’re a Chicagoan . ”
» “ Do you consider Chicago , its teams , its people , and everything about the city an underdog ? ”
No .
“ Are you hyperalert to perceived slights against Chicago ? ” No .
“ Then you ’re not part of the city .
You ’re just in the city . ”
So all this invites the question :
What the hell am I ?
Born in Texas , raised in Kansas , educated in Colorado , with parents residing in Albuquerque and family spread from Seattle to Palm Beach , I no longer know where to call home .
If I ’m not a Chicagoan , then I ’m nothing .
“ You ’re nothing , ” my wife said , patting my hand .
“ But do n’t feel bad .
So are , like , 90 percent of the people here .
Besides , we ca n’t afford to live in Lake Point Tower anyway . ”

Software Transactional Memory
by
R. Mark Volkmann , Partner
Object Computing , Inc. ( OCI )
last updated on 9/4/09
Contents
Writing software applications in which parts of the application run in concurrent threads introduces many challenges not present in single - threaded applications .
Since the order of operations is n't fixed , failures can be difficult to repeat .
Also , thoroughly testing the software requires more effort .
There are two general categories of multithreaded software .
In one category the goal is to divide the work involved in processing a single " job " into pieces and run the pieces concurrently in order to complete the job sooner .
In the other category the goal is to coordinate the execution of multiple " jobs " , allowing them to execute concurrently so that as a group they complete sooner than if they were run serially .
In both cases there can be contention over the data being accessed .
However , the issue is perhaps more common and harder to avoid in the second category .
There are many models for creating concurrent software .
The most popular today are based on locks , actors and transactional memory .
This article briefly describes all three models and then dives deeper into software - based transactional memory ( STM ) [ 4 ] .
The goals of this article are to :
spread knowledge about STM
support reasoning about the performance characteristics of STM
encourage implementations of STM for many programming languages
facilitate the ability of interested developers to suggest improvements to the STM implementation in the Clojure programming language
provide developers with enough understanding of the Clojure STM implementation that they can develop tools to help with tuning STM usage ( such as tracking the number of times a transaction retries and why it retries )
Please send feedback on errors and ways to improve explanations to mark@ociweb.com .
Updates to this article that indicate the " last updated " date and provide a dated list of changes will be provided at [ 1 ] .
Lock - based concurrency provides a mechanism for threads to safely access shared memory .
In its simplest form , exclusive ownership of a lock must be acquired before a given block of code is executed .
This is used to ensure that only one thread at a time can execute the code .
In object - oriented programming languages , often the lock is associated with an object that is accessed by code in the block .
Sometimes multiple objects are accessed and a single lock object is designated to provide exclusive access to that group of objects .
Benefits of using lock - based concurrency include the following :
Developers have explicit control over when locks are obtained and released which allows optimal solutions .
Many developers are already familiar with this form of managing concurrency .
Many programming languages support the use of locks .
Issues with using lock - based concurrency include the following :
It can be difficult to determine which lock (s ) need to be obtained in order for a given block of code to execute safely .
Variables for which a lock should be acquired can be accessed even when the wrong lock (s ) are acquired and even when no locks are acquired .
A thread is in a deadlock state when it is unable to acquire all the locks it needs to proceed because other threads own them and are themselves deadlocked .
This can easily occur unless locks are acquired in a common order .
It is also recommended to release locks in the reverse order from which they were acquired .
Recovering from errors can be complicated because developers must remember to release locks that were acquired by the failing code .
Correctly synchronized methods cannot be composed into compound methods without additional synchronization .
The lock - based approach is pessimistic .
It assumes that if multiple threads are each running sections of code that access the same memory then only one at a time can safely run .
This is not always true .
Making this assumption reduces the amount of concurrent processing that can occur .
The actor model [ 3 ] is an alternative to shared memory concurrency , such as lock - based concurrency and transactional memory .
Actors are software entities that execute as separate processes or light - weight threads .
Rather than accessing shared memory , actors only use and retain data that is passed to them in asynchronous messages .
When an actor receives a message , it can do the following things concurrently or in any order :
create new actors
send messages to other actors
specify how the next message it receives will be handled
Benefits of using actor - based concurrency include the following :
Since no memory is shared between actors , access to data does n't need to be synchronized .
Issues with using actor - based concurrency include the following :
Since memory is n't shared between actors , some messages may need to be large .
This negatively affects performance .
Since memory is n't shared between actors , the data each actor holds can become inconsistent with the data held by other actors .
There is no general mechanism for coordinating the activities of multiple actors .
The actor model is a central feature of the Erlang programming language .
It is also supported by Scala and Haskell , but not Clojure [ 13 ] .
For a more detailed description of actors , see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model.
Transactional memory provides an alternative to lock - based and actor - based concurrency that simplifies writing applications in which concurrently running threads access shared memory .
The concept is similar to that of database transactions which provide ACID characteristics :
" A " is for atomic .
" C " is for consistent .
" I " is for isolated .
" D " is for durable .
" Atomic " means that either all the changes in a transaction will be made successfully ( commit ) or none of them will be ( rollback ) .
" Consistent " means that all the data seen by a transaction at its start and end will be consistent .
In other words , constraints on the data will not be violated .
" Isolated " means that changes made inside a transaction are not visible outside the transaction until it commits .
" Durable " means that after a transaction has committed , changes it made will not be lost , even if there is a network , hardware or software malfunction .
Transactions are demarcated in code by a special syntax that varies across implementations .
From the perspective of other threads , all the memory changes made within a transaction appear to happen at the same moment when a transaction is finished committing .
The changes are not visible to other threads before then .
Transactions operate on a consistent snapshot of the memory .
If any memory that is written within transaction " A " is modified and committed by transaction " B " before " A " commits , the code in " A " is rerun .
These characteristics make transactional memory atomic , consistent and isolated .
Note that transactional memory is not durable .
If the software crashes or there is a hardware malfunction , data in memory is typically lost .
When durability is required , using a relational database is often recommended .
Transactional memory is optimistic .
Each transaction assumes it will be able to run its code without concurrently running threads changing the values it writes .
When this assumption does n't hold , the transaction discards all the work it has done and retries from the beginning .
The possibility of retries makes it necessary to avoid any actions ( side effects ) that should n't be repeated or can not be undone .
This includes I /O operations .
Clojure provides a solution for this that involves a combination of Refs and Agents .
This is discussed later .
In descriptions of the retry process later , this article distinguishes between a " transaction " and a " transaction try " .
A transaction includes one or more transaction tries .
A transaction that completes without having to retry runs a single transaction try .
Otherwise there are more than one .
Transactional memory distinguishes between committed values of variables and in -transaction values .
Inside a transaction , the value of a variable starts out as either its initial value or the last value committed by a transaction .
When the value of a variable is modified inside a transaction , that change is only seen and used in the transaction .
When the transaction commits , changes become visible to code outside the transaction .
Benefits of using transactional memory include the following :
It provides increased concurrency which means there are more opportunities for processing to be performed simultaneously instead of serially .
This is especially true for transactions that only read data .
Lock - based concurrency does n't allow this kind of overlapping execution because it takes a pessimistic approach rather than an optimistic one .
It is easier to write correct code using transactional memory than writing code that uses locks .
The need to determine the locks to be acquired and the order in which to acquire them is removed .
Instead , developers identify sections of code that require a consistent view of the set of variables it reads and writes .
Implementations can guarantee that deadlock [ 5 ] , livelock [ 6 ] and race conditions [ 7 ] will never occur .
Issues with using transactional memory include the following :
There is a potential for a large number of transaction retries resulting in wasted work .
There is overhead imposed by transaction bookkeeping such as storing histories of committed values , storing in - transaction values and acquiring locks before committing changes .
Tool support is currently lacking .
For example , having tools that identify how often each transaction retries and why they retry ( such as learning which variables had write conflicts ) would make it easier to tune applications when necessary .
Transactional memory works best in programming languages that distinguish between mutable and immutable variables and require mutable variables to be mutated inside a transaction ( like in Clojure and Haskell ) .
Without these features , developers are on their honor to only modify mutable variables inside transactions .
They must ensure that no data that requires coordinated changes is modified outside an STM transaction .
This is similar to the issue with lock - based concurrency where developers are on their honor to acquire the correct lock (s ) before accessing variables where this is expected .
Garbage Collection Analogy
Dan Grossman , an associate professor at the University of Washington , wrote a paper titled " The Transactional Memory / Garbage Collection Analogy " [ 8 ] .
The paper illustrates several ways in which transactional memory ( TM ) is similar to garbage collection ( GC ) .
Some quotes from a related presentation follow :
" Many used to think GC was too slow without hardware . "
" Many used to think GC was about to take over , decades before it did . "
" Many used to think we needed a back door for when GC was too approximate . "
These same thoughts are often expressed about TM today .
Perhaps over time these thoughts will change in the same way they have changed for GC .
Dan discusses this paper in episode 68 of the " Software Engineering Radio " podcast [ 9 ] .
Transactional memory can be implemented by hardware or software .
This article focuses on software implementations which are commonly referred to as STM .
STM is an integral part of some programming languages .
For others , it is supported through add - on libraries .
One way programming languages avoid the issue of data being modified by concurrently running threads is by providing immutable data structures or collection classes .
Clearly data that cannot change does n't need to be protected .
It is often desirable to be able to create new data structures that are similar to existing ones , for example , a list with a new item added at one end or a hash map with a new key / value pair added .
Persistent data structures [ 14 ] provide a way to do this where new data structures share memory with existing ones .
Using these saves both memory and time .
The benefit of having immutable data structures that are not persistent is questionable since creating new ones from them is slow and can consume a large amount of memory .
Many STM implementations are listed in the STM Wikipedia entry [ 15 ] .
Programming languages for which STM implementations exist include : C , C++ , C# , Clojure , Common Lisp , Haskell , Java , MUMPS , OCaml , Perl 6 , Python , Scheme and Smalltalk .
For many of these languages there are multiple STM implementations from which to choose .
Just as there are many ways to implement garbage collection , there are many ways to implement STM .
It is difficult to make general statements about the characteristics of STM implementations , such as memory usage and performance .
The remainder of this article focuses on the Clojure implementation .
One aspect of the Clojure STM implementation that differs from many others is that data coordinated by transactions cannot be modified outside a transaction .
With some implementations , developers are " on their honor " to use them correctly ( for example , Deuce STM ) .
Clojure is a functional programming language that is a Lisp dialect and runs on the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) .
It was created by Rich Hickey .
For a detailed discussion on Clojure , see my earlier article [ 2 ] .
In Clojure all variables are immutable unless they refer to a reference object .
There are four types of reference objects : Var , Atom , Agent and Ref. Each type is described below .
For more detail , including sample code , see my earlier article .
Vars are variables that have a root value that is shared between all threads and can have thread - specific values .
The functions that modify the value of a Var include def , set ! and binding .
The value of a Var is obtained by directly referencing it , as in other programming languages .
Vars are mainly used for constants .
In general , modifying the value of a Var is discouraged .
One use of Vars where modifying the value is seen as acceptable is for configuration variables .
For example , if the special variable * warn - on - reflection * is set to true , Clojure will output warning messages whenever it uses reflection to determine the type of an object .
This is useful while tuning an application for performance as it provides guidance in determining where adding optional type hints may help .
Atoms are variables that have a single value that is shared across all threads .
They are accessed in an atomic way , so it is safe for multiple threads to concurrently read and write them .
The functions that modify the value of an Atom include reset ! , compare - and - set ! and swap ! .
The value of an Atom is obtained by dereferencing it using @var - name .
Agents are variables that , like Atoms , have a single value that is shared across all threads .
They are modified asynchronously by invoking a function , called an " action " , in another thread .
The value returned by the action becomes the new value of the Agent .
The value of an Agent is obtained by dereferencing it using @var - name .
Actions sent to the same Agent are queued up so that only one action at a time will be run per Agent .
The functions that queue an action are send and send - off .
They return immediately since the specified action is executed asynchronously .
They differ only in the thread pool that is used .
One pool has a fixed size and the other has a variable size .
The action is is passed the current value of the Agent and any other arguments that were passed to send or send - off .
The await function pauses the current thread until all actions sent to a given set of Agents have completed .
The await - for function is similar , but supports a timeout .
Actions sent to agents inside a transaction are held until after the transaction commits .
This feature is sometimes used as a way to attach code that has side effects , such as I/O , to a transaction .
Refs are variables that , like Atoms and Agents , have a single value that is shared across all threads .
They can only be modified inside an STM transaction .
The functions that modify the value of a Ref include ref-set , alter and commute .
The value of a Ref is obtained by dereferencing it using @var - name .
In this article , when discussing Refs , the terms " read " and " dereference " are used synonymously .
A transaction is not required in order to dereference a Ref , but one is needed to get a consistent snapshot when dereferencing multiple Refs .
Refs are the only type of variable in Clojure that is coordinated by STM .
For this reason , they are the focus of this article .
The most direct way to change the value of a Ref is to use the ref-set function .
It takes the Ref whose value is to be modified and the new value .
For both the alter and commute functions the first argument is the Ref whose value is to be modified and the second argument is a function that returns the new value .
When this function is invoked , it is passed the current value of the Ref and any additional arguments that were passed to alter or commute .
The return value becomes the new value of the Ref .
Using alter instead of ref-set is typically seen as more idiomatic .
A conversation with the CIP ( Clojure Idiomatic Police ) might go as follows :
CIP : Why did you use ref-set instead of alter ?
You :
Well , I already had the value I wanted to use for the Ref , so I just passed it to ref-set .
CIP : Where did you get that value ?
You :
It was computed in a function I called .
CIP : Why did n't you just pass the Ref , the function and its arguments to alter ?
Do n't be afraid to pass functions to functions .
This is encouraged in functional programming .
In most cases , alter is preferred over commute .
Using commute is only appropriate when the order of changes to the Ref made by concurrently running transactions does n't matter .
This is related to the mathematical definition of " commutative " which includes the phrases " the result obtained ... does not differ with the order " .
Choosing to use commute basically says " I 'm going to modify a Ref , but I do n't care if another transaction modifies it before I commit my change .
Decisions I make in this transaction based on my value of the Ref will still be correct .
I want the value of the Ref to be recomputed when I 'm ready to commit based on the newest value of the Ref . "
Some situations where commute makes sense include accumulating objects in a collection and storing values calculated from a collection ( such as a minimum , maximum or average ) .
Suppose a collection is held in a Ref .
If two concurrent transactions add an object to the collection , in many cases it does n't matter which adds to it first .
There may be no reason for transaction " A " to retry just because transaction " B " added to the collection before " A " committed .
Suppose another Ref holds a value computed from the collection such as the maximum value in it .
There may be no reason for transaction " A " to retry just because transaction " B " committed a change to the maximum value .
It can be safely and correctly computed again based on the latest contents of the collection .
When ref-set or alter is used and another transaction has committed a change to the Ref since the current transaction try began , the current transaction will be retried .
When commute is used , the current transaction will continue and the in-transaction value of the Ref will be passed to the function that is passed to commute .
This results in better performance because retries are n't required .
The functions and arguments passed to commute during a single transaction execution are saved in a sorted map .
The keys in the map are Ref objects and the values are lists of objects that describe the functions and their arguments .
The map is sorted based on the order in which the Ref objects were created .
When the transaction is committing , a write lock is acquired for each Ref in the map in sorted order and all its commute functions are called a second time to determine the Ref values that will be committed .
Obtaining the write locks in this sorted order prevents deadlocks that might otherwise occur if multiple transactions attempt to commit their changes at the same time .
The Ref values passed to the commute functions this time depend on whether another transaction has committed a new value since the current transaction try started .
If so then the newest committed values are used .
Otherwise , the in - transaction value is used .
This means the values passed to the commute functions can differ from the values passed the first time they are called .
Within a transaction , a Ref can not be set to a new value using ref-set or alter after commute has been called on it .
Sometimes it is desirable to prevent other transactions from changing the value of a Ref that will be read by the current transaction , or perhaps modified later in the current transaction .
( An example is preventing write skew which is discussed later . )
This is achieved by calling ensure on the Ref .
While this guarantees that no other transaction can modify the Ref , it does n't guarantee that the current transaction will be able to modify it .
This is because any number of transactions can call ensure on the same Ref .
The following table is useful for selecting between Atoms , Agents and Refs when creating mutable variables .
The word " coordinated " here means managed by a transaction .

Before diving into the implementation details of Clojure STM , it is important to have a basic understanding of some features of Clojure that are related to the implementation .
Validators are functions that are invoked whenever the value of a given reference type object is being modified .
If the function determines that the change is n't " valid " , it can return false or throw an exception to prevent the change from occurring .
Each reference type object can have only one validator function .
The set - validator !
function assigns a validator function to a reference object .
There are two mechanisms for being notified when the value of a reference object may have changed , watch functions and watcher Agents .
Watch functions must take four arguments which are an identifier " key " , the reference object that may have changed , its old value and its new value .
The key can be used to indicate the purpose of the watch or it can be any data to be made available to the watch function when it is invoked .
Each reference object being watched can have a single watch function for each key value .
A watch function is registered with a reference object by calling the add - watch function which takes the reference object , a key and a watch function .
A watch function is removed from a reference object by calling the remove - watch function .
which takes a reference object and a key .
Watcher Agents are notified that a reference object has changed by sending a given action to the Agent .
The action function is passed the current value of the Agent and the reference object that changed , but not the old value .
A watcher Agent is registered with a reference object by calling the add - watcher function which takes a reference object , a send type ( which identifies the thread pool to be used ) , an Agent , and the action function to be sent .
The add - watcher function creates an anonymous function that sends the action to the Agent and registers that with the reference object by passing it to the add - watch function .
The Agent is used as the key .
A watcher Agent is removed from a reference object by calling the remove - watcher function which takes the reference object and the Agent .
This section describes the current Clojure STM implementation at a high level .
Low level details are provided later in this article .
The information is accurate as of Clojure 1.0 ( git commit 94c4a6a on 8/3/2009 ) , but is subject to change in the future .
This article should not be viewed as a specification for Clojure STM .
It should be emphasized that understanding the details of the Clojure STM implementation is NOT required in order to use it successfully .
Still , there are many reasons ( listed in the goals of this article ) that one might be interested in the details .
Currently Clojure is implemented by a combination of Java and Clojure source code .
Nearly all the STM implementation is written in Java .
An effort is underway to dramatically increase the amount that is implemented in Clojure .
When that effort is complete , most or all of the code described in this and the next section will be discarded .
It seems reasonable to speculate that the STM mechanisms will remain similar .
My intention is to update this article whenever the Clojure STM implementation changes so it remains an accurate source of information that is easier to digest than simply reading the source code .
Design
The Clojure STM implementation is based on multi-version concurrency control ( MVCC ) [ 16 ] and snapshot isolation [ 17 ] .
The main difference between the standard definition of these concepts and the Clojure implementation is that Clojure works with in - memory values of variables instead of database tables , rows and columns .
Wikipedia describes these concepts very well as follows .
Parts related to databases are in square brackets .
My clarifiations are in non-italic text .
" MVCC uses timestamps or increasing transaction IDs to achieve serializability .
MVCC ensures a transaction never has to wait for a [ database ] object by maintaining several versions of an object .
Each version would have a write timestamp and it would let a transaction read the most recent version of an object which precedes the transaction timestamp . "
" If a transaction ( Ti ) wants to write to an object , and if there is another transaction ( Tk ) ( that also wants to write it ) , the timestamp of Ti must precede the timestamp of Tk for the object write operation to succeed .
Which is to say a write cannot complete if there are outstanding transactions with an earlier timestamp . "
" Every object would also have a read timestamp , and if a transaction Ti wanted to write to object P , and the timestamp of that transaction is earlier than the object 's read timestamp , the transaction Ti is aborted and restarted .
Otherwise , Ti creates a new version of P and sets the read / write timestamps of P to the timestamp of the transaction . "
( The Clojure STM implementation does not use read timestamps . )
" The obvious drawback to this system is the cost of storing multiple versions of objects [ in the database ] .
On the other hand reads are never blocked , which can be important for workloads mostly involving reading values [ from the database ] .
MVCC is particularly adept at implementing true snapshot isolation , something which other methods of concurrency control frequently do either incompletely or with high performance costs . "
" A transaction executing under snapshot isolation appears to operate on a personal snapshot [ of the database ] , taken at the start of the transaction .
When the transaction concludes , it will successfully commit only if the values updated by the transaction have not been changed externally since the snapshot was taken . "
An issue with snapshot isolation is that it allows write skew .
This happens when concurrent transactions read common sets of data and make changes to different data within that set and there are constraints on the data .
For example , suppose a town places a restriction ( constraint ) on the total number of dogs and cats that a family can own .
Let 's say the limit is three .
When a person obtains a new dog or cat , they are entered in a database .
John and his wife Mary have one dog and one cat .
John adopts another dog while at the same time Mary adopts a cat .
These transactions occur concurrently .
Remember that transactions only see changes made by other transactions that have committed .
John 's transaction attempts to modify the number of dogs they own .
The constraint is n't violated because they now have a total of three .
Mary 's transaction attempts to modify the number of cats they own .
Like in the other transaction , the constraint is n't violated because they now have a total of three .
Both transactions are allowed to commit , resulting in a total of four dogs and cats which violates the constraint .
This is permitted because neither transaction attempts to commit a change to data that is being modified by another concurrent transaction .
Clojure provides a mechanism for avoiding write skew .
See the ensure function discussed later .
The Clojure STM implementation uses locks and a lock - free strategy .
In almost all cases , locks are released soon after they are acquired , rather than being held for the duration of a transaction .
A lock - free strategy is used to mark Refs that have been modified in a transaction .
Details behind the use of locks and the lock - free strategy are provided later .
Transaction Creation
In Clojure an STM transaction is created by passing any number of expressions , called the body , to the dosync macro ( defined in src/clj/clojure/core.clj ) .
This greatly simplifies coding for concurrency over using explicit locks .
It is not necessary to indicate which Refs might be modified in the transaction .
However , developers still need to make good decisions about what code should be inside it a dosync call , based on the set of Refs that need to be in a consistent state while the body executes .
Java Concurrency
The current Clojure STM implementation utilizes several Java concurrency classes .
These include :
LockingTransaction and Ref Classes
The main classes in the Clojure STM implementation are LockingTransaction and Ref , both in the clojure . lang package .
Both are located in the src / jvm / clojure / lang directory .
UML class diagrams showing the attributes and methods of those classes and related classes appear below .
It will be useful to refer to these diagrams often while reading the remainder of this article .
The dosync macro call that wraps each transaction body calls the sync macro which calls the LockingTransaction static method runInTransaction .
The sync macro passes body of the transaction to runInTransaction as an anonymous function .
Each thread has one LockingTransaction object , maintained as a ThreadLocal variable .
If a LockingTransaction object has n't yet been created for the current thread then one is created .
If the current thread is already running a transaction then the anonymous function is called inside it , i.e. , transactions compose .
Otherwise a new transaction is started and the function is called inside it .
Transaction Status
The status of a transaction is always one of the following five values :
RUNNING
COMMITTING
RETRY
KILLED
COMMITTED
The meaning of each of these status values is self evident , except perhaps RETRY and KILLED .
When the status is RETRY , the transaction will attempt a retry but has n't started the next try yet .
When that occurs , the status changes to RUNNING .
There are two situations that cause the status of a transaction to be set to KILLED .
The first is when the abort method is called on a transaction .
That sets the status to KILLED and throws an AbortException which causes the transaction to stop without retrying .
( In the current version of Clojure , no code calls abort . )
The second is when the barge method ( see the section " Barging " below ) is called on a transaction .
That sets the status to KILLED and allows the transaction to retry .
Committed Values
Each Ref object maintains a chain of its committed values ( history ) in its tvals field .
The length of the chain is controlled by the fields minHistory and maxHistory .
These default to zero and ten , respectively , but can differ for each Ref object .
Other values can be specified when Refs are created by passing options to the ref function .
They can also be modified using the ref-min - history and ref-max - history functions .
See the section " Faults " below to learn why the chain length matters .
Locks
Each Ref object has a ReentrantReadWriteLock .
Any number of concurrent transactions can hold its read lock OR a single transaction can hold its write lock .
The only time one of these locks is held for the duration of a transaction is when ensure is called on a Ref .
In that case the transaction will hold the read lock until either the Ref is modified in the transaction or the transaction commits .
There is no circumstance under which a write lock will be held for the duration of a transaction .
Write locks are obtained only briefly when certain things occur during a transaction and then quickly released .
They are acquired again when the transaction commits and then released when the commit completes .
For more details on how these ReentrantReadWriteLock s are used , see the " Clojure STM - Low Level " section which describes the lock field in Ref class .
Calling ref-set or alter on a Ref gives it an in - transaction value that is n't seen by other transactions until the transaction commits .
This also sets the tinfo field of the Ref to refer to an object that describes the transaction that modified the Ref , including the order in which it started relative to others and its current status .
This is how one transaction knows that another one has modified a Ref and has n't yet committed .
Think of this like giving the Ref a ticket for admission into the commit party that will hopefully happen later .
A Ref cannot have a ticket for more than one of these parties .
For more details on how the tinfo field of a Ref is set , see the " Clojure STM - Low Level " section which describes the lock method in the LockingTransaction class .
In - transaction Values
Each LockingTransaction object maintains a map of in - transaction values for the Refs it has modified in its vals field .
The keys in this map are Ref objects and the values are the java.lang .
Object values of the Refs .
If a Ref is only read inside a transaction , its value is always retrieved from the tvals chain .
This requires walking the chain to find the newest value that was committed before the current transaction started .
This can make it inefficient to dereference a Ref multiple times in a transaction unless it is modified before the second dereference .
The first time a Ref is modified in transaction , its new value is placed in the vals map .
For the remainder of the transaction , its value is retrieved from the vals map .
A " fault " occurs when there is an attempt to read the value of a Ref inside a transaction , but the Ref has no in - transaction value and all the values in its chain of committed values were committed after the current transaction began .
This can happen when other transactions have committed a change to the Ref since the current transaction try began .
When a fault occurs , the transaction will retry .
When a transaction commits a change to a Ref that has experienced a fault in another transaction AND the chain is shorter than maxHistory , a new node is added to the chain of committed values for the Ref .
This also happens if the chain is shorter than minHistory .
Lengthing the chain reduces the likelihood that another fault will occur for the Ref in the future .
If no fault has occurred for Ref , instead of adding a new node , the last node in the chain becomes the first and it is modified to describe the newly committed value .
It should be clear from the discussion above that the length of the history chain for each Ref can differ .
The chains adapt based on the faults that occur .
If a fault never occurs for a given Ref and it has a minHistory of zero ( the default ) then the length of its chain will never exceed one .
These chains never become shorter .
After a fault causes a chain to grow , it either remains at that length or grows even longer when more faults occur .
The term " barge " is used to describe the process of determining whether a given transaction should retry while the current transaction continues .
When one transaction attempts to barge another , it will only succeed if three conditions are met .
First , the transaction doing the barge must have been running for at least 1/100th of a second ( see the BARGE_WAIT_NANOS constant ) .
Second , this transaction must have started before the transaction to be barged .
This means older transactions are favored over newer ones .
Third , the status of the other transaction must be RUNNING and must be successfully changed to KILLED .
The check of the transaction status and changing it are done atomically .
The last condition means that if the other transaction is in the process of committing ( status = COMMITTING ) its changes , it will not be barged .
Retries
When a transaction retries , all the in - transaction changes it has made to Refs are discarded and execution returns to the beginning of the transaction body .
There are many scenarios that can cause a transaction to retry .
Each is described below .
The ref-set or alter function is called on a Ref .
This causes an attempt to " lock " the Ref , but one of the following situations occur :
A write lock cannot be obtained for the Ref because another thread holds a read or write lock for the Ref .
A change to the Ref has been committed since the current transaction try started .
Another transaction has made an in- transaction change to the Ref that has n't been committed yet and an attempt to barge the other transaction fails .
An attempt is made to read the value of a Ref inside a transaction ( i.e. , dereference it ) , but one of the following situations occur : Another transaction has barged the current one ( status is n't RUNNING ) .
The Ref has no in - transaction value yet , and a fault occurs .
This means the chain of committed values for the Ref does n't contain a value that was committed before the current transaction began .
The ref-set , alter , commute or ensure function is called on a Ref , but another transaction has barged the current one ( status is n't RUNNING ) .
The current transaction is committing its changes , but another running transaction has an in- transaction change and an attempt to barge it fails .
A transaction wo n't retry indefinitely .
There is a limit that is specified by the RETRY_LIMIT constant in the LockingTransaction class .
It is currently set to 10,000 .
This is used in the retry loop inside the run method in the LockingTransaction class .
If it is exceeded then a generic Exception object is thrown .
Retries are triggered by throwing a RetryEx which is a custom subclass of java.lang .
Error defined in LockingTransaction .java .
It extends Error instead of Exception so that it wo n't be caught by user code that simply catches Exception .
This is important since the code in a transaction can catch a generic Exception and can call Java code that does so .
The retry loop contains a try block with a catch for RetryEx .
The catch simply allows execution to return to the top of the loop .
No other kinds of exceptions are caught , so they cause the retry loop to exit .
IllegalStateException
An IllegalStateException is thrown from many methods in the Clojure implementation .
When thrown inside a transaction , the transaction will not retry .
Those related to STM are thrown when the following occur :
An attempt is made to get the LockingTransaction for the current thread , but it has n't been created yet or it is n't running .
This happens when any of the following functions are called outside a transaction : ref-set , alter , commute or ensure .
for the current thread , but it has n't been created yet or it is n't running .
This happens when any of the following functions are called outside a transaction : , , or .
An attempt is made to get the value of Ref , but no value has been bound to it yet ( like an uninitialized variable ) .
An attempt is made to set the in- transaction value of a Ref using ref-set or alter , but the commute function has already been called on the Ref in the current transaction .
or , but the function has already been called on the Ref in the current transaction .
A validation function for a Ref either returns false or throws an exception .
Deadlocks , Livelocks and Race Conditions
The Clojure STM implementation guarantees that deadlocks , livelocks and race conditions will not occur .
In the context of multithreaded software applications , these terms can be described as follows .
A deadlock occurs when concurrently running threads cannot proceed because they are each waiting on a resource for which another has acquired exclusive access .
A livelock occurs when concurrently running threads are performing work ( as opposed to be being blocked , waiting on resources ) , but cannot complete due to something that other threads have done or not done .
A race condition occurs when the outcome of a thread is wrong due to the timing of changes to shared state made by another concurrently running thread .
In Clojure STM , this applies to modifying a Ref within a transaction .
Suppose transactions A and B start in that order and are running concurrently .
If they both attempt to modify the same Ref using ref-set or alter ( write conflict ) , preference is given to transaction A because it has been running the longest ( provided it has been running for a minimal amount of time ) .
This avoids livelock that might occur if retries were based on the order in which refs are set .
Transaction B will retry , possibly multiple times , and will be able to modify the Ref after transaction A commits its changes .
When transaction B finally runs to completion , it will do so with a consistent view of the changes committed by transaction A .
When transactions modify Refs using commute , no write conflicts occurs .
Deadlocks are avoided during the commit by obtaining write locks for the Refs in a consistent order ( which is the order in which the Ref objects were created ) .
Clojure STM Overhead
Using STM instead of explicit locks adds processing overhead .
This does n't necessarily mean that the STM approach is slower .
Since STM is optimistic and locks are pessimistic , it is possible for STM to provide better overall performance for some applications due to greater concurrency .
When a Ref that has not yet been modified inside a transaction is read inside the transaction , a value is selected from its chain of committed values .
As long as no other transaction has committed a new value for the Ref since the current transaction began , this will be fast since the value used will be that of the first node in the chain .
Otherwise some chain walking will take place .
The value of a Ref can only be modified inside a transaction .
When this is done , there is overhead incurred to verify that a transaction is running .
It also must verify that the commute function has n't already been called on the Ref .
( It would n't make sense to allow this because commute functions are called a second time during the commit and any other setting of the Ref would n't have any lasting effect after the transaction completes . )
If this is the first time the Ref has been modified in the current transaction , there is overhead incurred in adding the Ref to a set of Refs that the transaction has modified and marking the Ref as being modified by the current transaction ( see the description of the lock method in the next paragraph ) .
Finally , the new value is added to the map of in - transaction values for the current transaction .
Subsequent reads of the Ref inside the transaction will use the value from that map instead of selecting a value from the chain of committed values .
The lock method in the LockingTransaction class introduces overhead .
This involves many steps that are summarized below :
If ensure was called earlier in this transaction try on the Ref then release the read lock for the Ref. Attempt to acquire a write lock for the Ref .
If it cannot be acquired then trigger a retry for the current transaction .
If another transaction has committed a change to the Ref since the current transaction try began then trigger a retry for the current transaction .
If another transaction has made an as - yet uncommitted change to the Ref , attempt to barge it .
If that fails then trigger a retry for the current transaction .
Mark the Ref as being locked by the current transaction by setting its tinfo field to refer to an Info object that describes the current transaction .
In any case , release the write lock for the Ref .
When the end of the transaction is reached , there is overhead incurred in committing the modified Refs , which makes their new , in - transaction values visible outside the current transaction .
This involves many steps that are summarized below :
Change the status of the current transaction from RUNNING to COMMITTING .
Rerun any commute functions called on Refs in the transaction .
This involves acquiring a write lock for each commuted Ref. Acquire write locks for all other Refs modified in the transaction .
Call all the validate functions that were registered on the Refs that were modified .
Retry the current transaction if any of them disapprove of a change .
Add a node to the chain of committed values , or modify an existing node , for each Ref to be modified ( depending on faults , minHistory and maxHistory ) .
Create a Notify object for each Ref that was modified and has at least one registered watcher .
Change the status of the current transaction from COMMITTING to COMMITTED .
Release all the write locks acquired previously .
Release all the read locks still held due to calls to ensure .
Clear the locked ( local ) , ensures , vals , sets and commutes collections in preparation for the next retry or new transaction in the current thread .
If the commit was successful , notify all registered watchers of the changes using data in the Notify objects and dispatch all actions sent to Agents in the transaction .
Clear the notify ( local ) and actions collections in preparation for the next retry or new transaction in the current thread .
Return the value of the last expression in the transaction body .

Feel free to skip to the " Conclusion " section near the end if you do n't have a need for additional detail .
While reading about the low - level details of the Clojure STM implementation , refer to the earlier class diagrams to aid with understanding the relationships between the many related classes and interfaces .
It is also helpful to look at the source code in core.clj , ARef.java , Ref.java and LockingTransaction .
java while reading this section .
STM Macros
These macros are defined in src/clj / clojure / core.clj .
Name Description dosync
This macro accepts any number of expressions .
It simply passes them to the sync macro which is defined in the same source file .
sync
This macro accepts any number of expressions .
It runs them inside a transaction .
If it is called in the context of an existing transaction , the expressions are run inside it .
Otherwise a new transaction is started .
It wraps the expressions in an anonymous function that implements the Callable interface and passes that to the static Java method runInTransaction in the clojure.
lang .
LockingTransaction class .
STM Functions
These functions are defined in src/clj / clojure / core.clj .
The alter , commute , ensure and ref-set functions must be called inside a transaction , i.e. , inside a call to the dosync macro .
When the phrase " in-transaction value " is used below it means either the in- transaction value if there is one or the newest committed value before the transaction try began .
Name Description add - watch
This function takes a reference object , a key and a function .
It registers the function under the key for the reference object .
When the value of the reference object changes , the function is invoked with the key , the reference object , the old value and the new value .
This calls the addWatch method on the Ref. add - watcher
This function takes a reference object , a send type ( which identifies the thread pool to be used ) , an Agent and the action function to be sent .
It creates an anonymous function that sends the action to the Agent and registers that with the reference object by passing it to the add - watch function .
The Agent is used as the key .
alter
This function takes a Ref , a function that will return its new value , and optional , additional arguments .
It changes the value of a Ref to the result of invoking the given function on the in-transaction value of the Ref and any additional arguments .
This calls the alter method on the Ref object , which invokes the given function and passes the Ref and the function return value to the doSet method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread .
If another transaction has modified the same Ref then this transaction may retry ( see the lock method ) .
Otherwise , the new value is returned .
commute
This function is similar to alter and takes the same arguments , but differs in two ways .
First , commute does n't care if other transactions have committed changes to the Ref it is going to modify since the current transaction try began .
Whereas alter will retry , commute will proceed .
Second , when the transaction is committing its changes , all the calls to commute functions are rerun .
They are n't necessarily run in the same order in which they were invoked within the transaction body .
In all calls to the commute functions , both in the body of the transaction and during the commit , the Ref value passed to the given function is determined in the same way .
If ref-set or alter was called on the same Ref earlier in the transaction then the in-transaction value of the Ref is used .
Otherwise , the newest committed value of the Ref is used .
Note that the newest committed value may be the result of a transaction that committed since the current transaction try began .
This means that commute functions invoked during the commit can be passed different Ref values than they were passed when invoked in the transaction body .
This calls the commute method on the Ref. ensure
This function takes a Ref .
It prevents other transactions from setting an in- transaction value for the Ref , which also prevents them from committing a new value .
This can be used to avoid write skew .
It also helps avoid retries due to write conflicts on the Ref .
The current transaction will be able to set a new value for the Ref later in the transaction as long as other transactions have n't called ensure on the same Ref .
This calls the touch method on the Ref which passes the Ref object to the doEnsure method of the LockingTransaction object for the current thread .
That acquires a read lock for the Ref which is held until the transaction commits or until the Ref is set with ref-set or alter later in the transaction try .
ref
This function creates and returns a Ref object which is a mutable reference to an immutable object .
It takes the initial value as an argument .
It also accepts options that include specifying a validator function and controlling the length of the history chain for this Ref .
See the output of ( doc ref ) for more information on options .
This calls a constructor in the Ref class .
ref-history - count
This function takes a Ref .
It returns the current length of its history chain .
This calls the getHistoryCount method on the Ref. ref-max - history
This function takes a Ref and an optional length .
If only a Ref is provided , it returns the maximum length of the history chain for the Ref .
If a length is also provided , it sets the maximum length and returns it .
If the history chain is already longer than the specified length , it is not shortened to the new maximum length .
It just wo n't grow any longer .
This calls the getMaxHistory and setMaxHistory methods on the Ref. ref-min - history
This function takes a Ref and an optional length .
If only a Ref is provided , it returns the minimum length of the history chain for the Ref .
If a length is also provided , it sets the minimum length and returns it .
This calls the getMinHistory and setMinHistory methods on the Ref. ref-set
This function takes a Ref and a proposed new value .
It changes the value of a Ref to the given value .
This passes the value to the set method on the Ref object , which calls the doSet method on the current LockingTransaction object .
If another transaction has modified the same Ref then this transaction may retry ( see the lock method ) .
Otherwise , the new value is returned .
remove - watch
This function takes a reference object and a key .
It removes the watch function associated with the given key from the map of watch functions for the reference object .
This calls the removeWatch method on the Ref. remove - watcher This function takes a reference object and a watcher Agent .
It removes the watch function with a key that matches the Agent from the map of watch functions for the reference object .
send
This function takes an Agent , a function and optional arguments .
It passes the function and optional arguments , along with a final argument of false , to the dispatch method of the Agent .
The false argument causes a fixed - size thread pool to be used .
send - off
Like send , this function takes an Agent , a function and optional arguments .
It passes the function and optional arguments , along with a final argument of true , to the dispatch method of the Agent .
The true argument causes a variable - size thread pool to be used .
set -validator !
This function takes a Ref and a function .
It sets the validator function for the Ref to the given function .
This calls the setValidator method on the Ref .
ARef Fields
The ARef class is defined in src/jvm / clojure / lang / ARef.java .
It is the superclass of the Ref class .
Name Description validator : IFn
This is the single validator function associated with this Ref. watches : IPersistentMap
This is a map of watch functions , one per key value , for this Ref .
ARef Methods
Name Description addWatch
This method takes an Object key and an IFn function .
It registers the function under the key in the watches map .
getValidator
This method gets the validator function for this Ref. getWatches
This method gets the map of watch functions for this Ref. notifyWatches
This method takes old and new values of the Ref .
It invokes all the watch functions for the Ref , passing them their key , this Ref , the old value and the new value .
removeWatch
This method takes an Object key and removes the watch function for the given key from this Ref. setValidator
This method takes an IFn function .
It sets the validator function for this Ref to the given function .
This method takes a proposed new Object value for this Ref and determines whether it is valid .
If not , an expection is thrown which prevents the Ref from taking on the new value .
Ref Nested Classes
The Ref class is defined in src / jvm / clojure / lang / Ref.java .
It is a subclass of the ARef class .
One static nested class is defined inside the clojure .lang .
Ref class .
Name Description TVal Objects from this class are POJOs that represent versions of values for Refs .
They are nodes in a doubly - linked , circular list .
The fields of this class are all package - level so they can be accessed directly by the Ref and LockingTransaction classes that are in the same package .
This class has two constructors and no methods .
TVal Fields
Name Description msecs:long
This is the creation system time of this object .
next : TVal
This is a reference to the TVal object that describes the next newer committed version of the Ref or the end of the chain if this is the first node in it .
point : long
This is an ordered identifier of a transaction commit .
Values that were committed in the same transaction will have the same value for this field .
prior : TVal
This is a reference to the TVal object that describes the next older committed version of the Ref or the beginning of the chain if this is the last node in it .
val : Object
This is a committed value for the Ref .
Ref Fields
All fields in the Ref class are package level , so LockingTransaction objects can directly access them .
Name Description faults : AtomicInteger
( final )
This field is used to count the number of times a transaction has attempted to retrieve the value of this Ref from its history chain , but found no value known before the read point which is an ordered identifier for the beginning of the current transaction try .
This can happen if other transactions have committed new values for the Ref since the current try of the current transaction began .
Transactions that encounter this situation will retry .
This field is reset to zero in the run method of LockingTransaction after a new node is added to the history chain for the Ref ( see the description of the fourth commit step in the run method later ) .
id:long
( final )
This field holds a unique , ordered identifier for the Ref .
Its value is assigned in the Ref constructor by calling getAndIncrement on the ids field .
ids:AtomicLong
( static , final )
This field is used to assign a unique identifier to each Ref object .
lock :
ReentrantReadWriteLock
( final )
This field maintains a pair of locks , one for readers and one for writers .
Only one thread at a time can hold the write lock .
When the write lock is held , no thread can hold the read lock .
Otherwise any number of threads can hold the read lock .
Being " reentrant " means that if a thread holds a lock and requests it again , perhaps through a recursive call , the request will succeed ( since it already owns the lock ) and execution will continue .
The java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock class implements the java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock interface .
The javadoc for ReadWriteLock is a good source for more information .
The Ref methods currentVal and isBound acquire a read lock and release it before they return .
These methods have a brief runtime .
The Ref methods trimHistory and getHistoryCount acquire a write lock and release it before they return .
These methods have a brief runtime .
The LockingTransaction method doEnsure acquires a read lock , but does n't release it before returning unless another transaction has modified the Ref and is still running .
In that case the current transaction will retry .
The LockingTransaction method releaseIfEnsured ( called by the lock and run methods ) releases a read lock acquired by the doEnsure method .
This method and the lock method have a brief runtime .
The run method runs for the duration of a transaction .
The only locks it may hold for a long period of time are read locks that are acquired by calling ensure on a Ref .
The LockingTransaction methods doGet and doCommute acquire a read lock and release it before they return .
The doGet method has a brief runtime .
The doCommute method may not have a brief runtime , but the amount of time for which it holds a read lock is brief .
It is only held while getting the newest committed value for a Ref , not while the commute function runs .
The LockingTransaction method tryWriteLock attempts to acquire a write lock .
This is called by the lock and run methods which both release the lock before completing .
The lock method has a brief runtime .
The run method only acquires write locks when a transaction is committing .
This may not be brief since during this time commute functions are rerun and validator functions are run .
The write locks are released before watchers are notified and Agent actions are dispatched .
No other methods use the read and write locks for Ref objects .
minHistory :int
maxHistory : int
These fields are used to limit the number of historical values that are retained for the Ref .
They default to zero and ten , respectively .
Details on how these values are used is provided later in the description of the run method in LockingTransaction .
tinfo :
LockingTransaction .
Info
This field holds the status of the transaction that has made an uncommitted change to the value of this Ref , but has n't yet committed the change .
When not null , it serves as an indication that the Ref has an active writer .
tvals : TVal
This field holds the newest node in a circular chain of TVal objects that each hold a historical value of the Ref that has been committed , not an in- transaction value .
Collectively these are referred to in this article as the " history chain " .
The number of values retained is controlled by the values of the minHistory and maxHistory fields which were described above .
When a Ref object is created , its tvals field is set to a TVal object that describes its initial value , not associated with any transaction .
Additional TVal objects are created in the run method of LockingTransaction during a commit .
TVal objects are used in the doCommute , doGet , lock and run methods of that class .
validator : IFn
This field represents a Clojure function that will be invoked whenever the value of the Ref is about to be modified .
A reference object can have only one validator function at a time .
The validator function should return a value that can be cast to a boolean whose value indicates whether the current value of the Ref is valid .
Alternatively , it can throw an exception if the value is not valid .
Returning false or throwing an exception prevents the change from taking place and causes an IllegalStateException to be thrown .
The setValidator method sets this field and immediately calls the validator function to validate the current value of the Ref .
The getValidator method returns the validator function as a IFn .
watches :
IPersistentMap
This field holds a map of functions that are called after a change to a Ref has been committed .
See the earlier section " Clojure Validators and Watchers " for information on registering watchers with a reference object .
After the run method in LockingTransaction commits a transaction , it calls the notifyWatches method on each Ref that was modified .
The notifyWatches method invokes each watch function registered with the Ref , passing it the key , the Ref , its old value and its new value .
Ref Methods
The methods in the Ref class that play a significant role in the STM implementation are described below .
Name Description constructors
This class has two constructors .
One takes only an initial value as a java.lang .
Object for the Ref .
The other takes that and a map of options .
alter
This method takes a function whose return value will become the new value of the Ref , and optional arguments to be passed to the function after the in-transaction value of the Ref .
It gets the value of the Ref by calling the doGet method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread .
See the description of that method below for details on how the value is obtained .
Next , it invokes the given function , passing it the Ref value and any additional arguments that were supplied .
Finally , it calls the doSet method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread , passing it the Ref object and the return value from the given function .
See the description of the doSet method later for details on why it may trigger a retry .
commute
This method takes a function whose return value will become the new value of the Ref , and optional arguments to be passed to the function after the current value of the Ref .
It simply passes all its parameters to the doCommute method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread .
currentVal
This method returns the newest committed value of the Ref. First , it obtains a read lock for the Ref .
Next , it accesses the value of the first TVal object in the history chain for the Ref .
If that chain is empty , meaning the Ref is unbound , an IllegalStateException is thrown .
Finally , the read lock is released .
This method is called by the deref method in the same class .
deref
This method returns the current value of the Ref .
If the current thread is in a transaction then it calls the doGet method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread to get the value .
Otherwise it calls the currentVal method in the same class .
getHistoryCount
This method acquires the write lock ( probably a read lock would suffice ) for the Ref ( blocking until successful ) , calls the histCount method , returns what it returns and releases the write lock .
It acquires a write lock instead of a read lock because it walks the history chain to get the count and needs to prevent other threads from modifying the chain while it does this .
This is called by the ref-history - count function .
histCount
This method returns the number of TVal objects associated with the Ref , which is the length of the history chain .
is Bound
This method returns a boolean that indicates whether there is at least one TVal object in the history chain for this Ref .
Before checking for this , a read lock is obtained for the Ref .
Before returning , the read lock is released .
set
This method takes a proposed new value for the Ref .
It simply passes the Ref and the new value to the doSet method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread .
touch
This method simply passes the Ref to the doEnsure method on the LockingTransaction object for the current thread .
It is called by the ensure function in order to prevent other transactions from changing this Ref. trimHistory
This method removes all the but newest TVal object from the history chain .
Before doing this , a write lock for the Ref is obtained .
Before returning , the write lock is released .
No code in the current version of Clojure calls this method .
LockingTransaction Constants
The LockingTransaction class is defined in src/jvm / clojure / lang / LockingTransaction .java .
Name Description BARGE_WAIT_NANOS
This specifies the minimum amount of time ( 1/100th of a second ) that a transaction must have run in order for it to attempt to cause another conflicting transaction to retry .
LOCK_WAIT_MSECS
This specifies the amount of time ( 1/10th of a second ) to wait for something to happen .
It is used by the tryWriteLock method to limit how long it waits to obtain a write lock for a given Ref .
It is also used by the lock method to limit how long it waits for the latch in an Info object associated with a given Ref to be decremented to zero .
RETRY_LIMIT
This specifies the maximum number of times a transaction will be retried before giving up .
The current value is 10,000 .
If it gives up then a plain java.lang .
Exception is thrown .
This happens in the run method .
RUNNING
COMMITTING
RETRY
KILLED
COMMITTED
These describe the status of a transaction .
Three of these have an obvious meaning .
RETRY is the status of a transaction that is going to retry , but has n't started the next try yet .
KILLED is the status of a transaction that was stopped by another , conflicting transaction .
The transaction will retry , and have its status changed to RETRY , unless an exception is also thrown ( which is done in the abort method ) .
LockingTransaction Nested Classes
These are static nested classes defined inside the LockingTransaction class .
Name Description AbortException
This is a simple subclass of java.lang .
Exception that is thrown in the abort method .
No code in the current version of Clojure calls that method , so this class is n't currently used .
CFn Objects from this class hold a reference to a function ( IFn ) and a sequence of arguments to be passed to it ( ISeq ) .
They are used to store information about commute functions so they can be invoked a second time when a transaction is being committed .
Info Objects from this class describe the status of a transaction .
A new one is created at the beginning of each transaction try .
The class has a single method , running , that returns a boolean indicating whether the transaction currently has a state of RUNNING or COMMITTING .
Notify
This class has three fields , one to hold a Ref that changed , one to hold its previous value , and one to hold its new value .
An instance is created and added to a list during a transaction commit for each Ref that was modified during the transaction .
After the transaction is committed , the information in these objects is used to notify the watchers of the Refs about the changes .
RetryEx
This is a simple subclass of java.lang .
Error .
Only one instance of this class is created per thread .
It is held in the retryex field of the single LockingTransaction object that is created for each thread .
This object is thrown whenever a transaction needs to retry .
The fact that it extends Error instead of Exception indicates that your code should not catch this .
The Clojure STM implementation catches it in the retry loop of the run method .
Since the done flag is n't set to true , the loop continues with another try of the transaction .
CFn Fields
Name Description fn: IFn
( final )
This is a reference to a function that was passed to the commute function .
args : ISeq
( final )
This is a list of arguments to be passed to the function .
Info Fields
Name Description latch :
java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch
( final )
This latch object is created in the constructor of the Info class with a value of one .
It is decremented by the stop method in LockingTransaction .
The blockAndBail method waits ( with a timeout ) for it to reach zero before triggering a retry of the current transaction .
The barge method also waits for it to reach zero so it knows that the transaction it is barging has been stopped .
status :
java.util.concurrent.AtomicInteger
( final )
This holds the current status of the associated transaction .
startPoint:long
( final )
This value identifies the order in which the associated transaction started , relative to other transaction starts , retries and commits .
Notify Fields
Name Description ref :
Ref
( final )
This is a Ref that was modified in a transaction .
oldval : Object
( final )
This is the previous value of the Ref. newval :
Object
( final )
This is the new value of the Ref .
LockingTransaction Fields
All fields in the LockingTransaction class are package level .
However , in the current version of Clojure no other classes extend LockingTransaction and no other classes in the same package directly access its fields .
Name Description actions :
ArrayList < Agent .
Action >
( final )
This field is a collection of Agent actions .
When actions are sent to Agents within a transaction , they are saved in this collection ( by the enqueue method ) and not actually sent until the transaction commits .
This is sometimes used to execute code that has side effects in order to prevent the side effects from occurring multiple times due to transaction retries .
The send and send - off functions that send actions to Agents both call the dispatch method in the Agent class .
That calls the dispatchAction method in the Agent class which checks for a running transaction in the current thread .
If one is running , it passes the action to the enqueue method in the LockingTransaction class .
commutes :
TreeMap
< Ref , ArrayList < CFn >>
( final )
This field is a map from Refs to the commute functions that have been called on them .
CFn is a static , nested class whose objects hold a reference to a Clojure function and a sequence of arguments to be passed to it .
When the transaction is ready to commit , all the commute functions are reexecuted to compute the Ref values that will be committed .
ensures : HashSet < Ref >
( final )
This field holds the set of Refs on which the ensure function has been called in the current transaction try .
It is accessed in the following LockingTransaction methods : doEnsure , releaseIfEnsured and run .
If a Ref is set using ref- set or alter after ensure has been called on it , it will be removed from this set by the releaseIfEnsured method which is called by the lock method .
During a commit , before commute functions are run a second time on on a Ref , the Ref is passed to the releaseIfEnsured method .
That releases the read lock on the Ref so a write lock can be obtained for it .
info :
LockingTransaction .
Info
This field holds an object that describes the status of the transaction , the system time when that status was set , and a CountDownLatch that starts with a value of one .
It has a single method , running , that returns a boolean indicating whether the transaction is currently running or committing .
When an attempt is made to set a Ref using ref-set or alter , the lock method in LockingTransaction is called .
A Ref is " locked " by setting its tinfo field to the value of the info field for the LockingTransaction object of the current thread .
The lock method in the LockingTransaction class assigns the value of this field to the tinfo field of a Ref to " lock " it .
There are three places in LockingTransaction where the tinfo field is used .
The first is in the lock method .
The second is in the doEnsure method .
The third is in the run method , during a commit when commute functions are run a second time .
In both the lock and run methods , if the tinfo field of the Ref is set to a LockingTransaction .
Info object from a different LockingTransaction and that transaction is currently running then the barge method will be called to determine which transaction should retry .
If the other transaction is selected to retry then the tinfo field of the Ref will be modified to refer to the LockingTransaction .
Info object for the current LockingTransaction .
See the description of the latch field in the Info class to learn how the latch is used .
lastPoint: AtomicLong
( static , final )
This field is used to provide long values that indicate the order in which significant transaction - related events occur .
These include the start of each transaction , each retry , and each commit .
readPoint:long
This field is used to track the order of the beginning of each transaction try across all transactions .
At the beginning of each retry , including the initial try , the getReadPoint method is called .
That assigns the next highest integer number to readPoint by atomically incrementing the lastPoint field .
This field has two uses .
It is used by the lock method to determine if the value of a Ref has been modified by any transaction commit since the transaction try began .
If this occurs then the current transaction will retry .
It is used by the doGet method to determine if the chain of values for the Ref contains any value that was set before the transaction try began .
When no such value is found in the chain , the number of " faults " that have occurred for the Ref is incremented .
retryex : RetryEx
( final )
This field holds the exception object that is thrown in several places to cause the transaction to retry .
RetryEx is a static , nested class that extends java.lang .
Error .
sets:HashSet < Ref >
( final )
This field keeps track of all the Refs that have been modified inside the current transaction try using ref-set or alter so the new values can be committed at the end of the transaction .
Note that the keys of the vals map cannot be used in place of this because it can contain values for Refs that are committed by other transactions when commute is called on those Refs in the current transaction .
startPoint:long
This field is assigned the value of the readPoint field at the beginning of the first try of the transaction .
It is used when two transactions are in conflict to determine which has been running longer .
If the the current transaction has been running for at least BARGE_WAIT_NANOS ( 1/100th of a second ) and it started before the other conflicting transaction then an attempt will be made to retry the other transaction .
See the barge method .
startTime : long
This field holds the system time when the first try to execute the transaction began .
It is used by the bargeTimeElapsed method to determine how long the transaction has been running .
transaction :
ThreadLocal
< LockingTransaction >
( static , final )
This field holds the single LockingTransaction object that is associated with each thread .
It is used to manage all transactions that are run in the current thread .
vals : HashMap
< Ref , Object >
( final )
This field is a map where the keys are Refs whose values have been modified within the current transaction and the values are their in - transaction values .
LockingTransaction Methods
The methods in the LockingTransaction class that play a significant role in the STM implementation are described below .
Name Description abort
This method stops the transaction , sets the status of the transaction to KILLED , and throws an AbortException .
The finally clause in the run method of LockingTransaction will properly clean up the aborted transaction and the exception will propagate out to the caller .
No code in the current version of Clojure calls this method .
barge
This method takes an Info object that describes the transaction to be barged .
It determines whether a given LockingTransaction , identified by its LockingTransaction .
Info object , should and can be retried in order to allow the LockingTransaction for the current thread to continue .
If the the current transaction has run for at least BARGE_WAIT_NANOS ( 1/100th of a second ) and it started before the given transaction then an attempt will be made to retry the given transaction .
This will succeed as long as the status of the other transaction is RUNNING .
If that is the case then , atomically with the check , the status of the other transaction is changed to KILLED .
Also , the latch field in the Info object of that transaction is decremented .
bargeTimeElapsed
This method determines whether the transaction has been running for more than BARGE_WAIT_NANOS ( 1/100th of a second ) .
Transactions that have been running for less time than this cannot barge other transactions .
Since they have barely started running , they will retry instead .
blockAndBail
This method takes a LockingTransaction .
Info object describing the status of another transaction .
It calls the stop method on the current transaction , giving it a status of RETRY .
It then waits for up to LOCK_WAIT_MSECS ( 1/10th of a second ) for the latch of the other transaction to be decremented to zero which will happen if the other transaction is barged or stopped .
Finally , it triggers a retry of the current transaction .
This part of the design was inspired by the paper " Software Transactional Memory Should Not Be Obstruction - Free " [ 11 ] .
If the current transaction were to retry immediately , the conflict that caused it to retry , would likely still be present .
The small amount of wait time to allow it to finish what it is doing decreases the odds that the conflict will still be present .
However , waiting until the other transaction completes would be pessimistic .
doCommute
This method takes a Ref , a function whose return value will become its new value , and arguments to be passed to the function after the current value of the Ref .
It verifies that a transaction is running in the current thread ( status = RUNNING or COMMITTING ) .
If not , it triggers a retry which will bring the status back to RUNNING .
If the transaction does n't yet have an in - transaction value for the Ref , it gets its newest value which may be a value that was committed by another transaction since this transaction began .
The newest value is added to the map of in - transaction values ( vals ) .
The function and its arguments are added to a list of commute functions for the Ref so they can be executed again during the commit .
It executes that function on the in-transaction value of the Ref and the arguments .
It replaces the in-transaction value of the Ref with the return value of the function and then returns that value .
During a transaction commit , in the run method , all the commute functions are rerun using in - transaction values .
They are n't necessarily called in the same order in which they were called in the transaction body .
doEnsure
This method takes a Ref .
It verifies that a transaction is running in the current thread ( status = RUNNING or COMMITTING ) .
If not , it triggers a retry which will bring the status back to RUNNING .
Otherwise it continues .
If this method has already been called on the given Ref during the current transaction try , then it simply returns .
Otherwise it acquires a read lock for the Ref .
If the Ref has been written by another transaction that has n't yet committed , it releases the read lock and calls blockAndBail which triggers a retry of the current transaction .
Otherwise the Ref is added to the set of Refs ensured in the current transaction try ( ensures ) .
doGet
This method takes a Ref whose value is to be returned .
It verifies that a transaction is running in the current thread ( status = RUNNING or COMMITTING ) .
If not , it triggers a retry which will bring the status back to RUNNING .
If the Ref has an in - transaction value , it is returned .
Otherwise it continues .
A read lock for the Ref is obtained .
If the Ref has no value ( unbound ) , an IllegalStateException is thrown .
It gets the newest committed value of the Ref and then repeatedly gets the next oldest value in the history chain until one is found that was committed before the current transaction try began .
It returns that value and releases the read lock on the Ref .
If the history of committed values for the Ref does n't contain a value that was committed before the current tranansaction try began then it increments the number of faults for the Ref and triggers a retry .
Faults cause more history to be retained for the Ref in the future ( managed in the run method ) .
Each time the history chain length for a Ref is increased by one due to a fault , the fault count for the Ref is reset to zero .
This method is called by the deref and alter methods in the Ref class .
doSet
This method takes a Ref and a proposed new value .
Its goal is to change the in-transaction value of the Ref .
It verifies that a transaction is running in the current thread ( status = RUNNING or COMMITTING ) .
If not , it triggers a retry which will bring the status back to RUNNING .
The ref-set and alter functions both result in a call to this method .
Neither can be called on a Ref after the commute function has been called on it in the current transaction try .
Doing so will cause an IllegalStateException to be thrown .
However , ref-set and alter can be called any number of times on the same Ref within a transaction and in any order .
If the Ref has n't been modified yet in the current transaction , indicated by its absence from the sets collection , three things are done .
First , the Ref is added to sets .
Second , the Ref is " locked " by passing it to the lock method .
Third , the Ref and its new value are added as key and value in the vals map .
Note that doCommute does not call lock on the Ref .
The new value is simply saved as the new in - transaction value of the Ref and it is returned .
If the Ref has a validator function , it will not be called until the transaction is committing the changes .
Note that a new history chain node ( TVal ) for the Ref is n't created until the transaction is ready to commit .
The doSet method is called from the set and alter methods of the Ref class .
enqueue
This method takes an Agent .
Action object that holds a reference to an Agent , a function to be invoked on it , arguments to be passed to the function and an indication of the thread pool in which the function should be executed .
It adds that object to the list of actions to be invoked after the transaction has committed .
getCommitPoint
This method takes no arguments .
It returns a value that is used to indicate the order in which commits occur .
It is called by the run method during a commit , after all the Refs to be modified by the transaction have been locked and immediately before new nodes are added to the history chains of the Refs being modified .
It obtains the next highest integer number by atomically incrementing the lastPoint field .
getEx
This method takes no arguments .
It returns the LockingTransaction object for the current thread if one has been created and is running , or throws an IllegalStateException otherwise .
Several methods in the Ref class call this .
They include alter , commute , set ( called by the ref- set function ) and touch ( called by the ensure function ) .
getReadPoint
This method takes no arguments .
It is called by the run method at the beginning of each transaction try .
The value it returns is used to indicate the order in which transactions start and retry .
It gets its value by atomically incrementing the lastPoint field .
getRunning
This method takes no arguments .
It returns the LockingTransaction object for the current thread if one has been created and is not stopped , or null otherwise .
isRunning
This method takes no arguments .
It returns a boolean that indicates whether the transaction associated with the current thread is currently running .
A transaction is considered to be running if a LockingTransaction object has been created for the current thread AND its info field is not null .
The stop method sets the info field to null .
That is called by the run method near the end of a transaction commit , by the abort method , and by the lock method when it is unable to obtain a lock for a Ref to be modified .
lock
This method takes a Ref , marks it as having its value set since the beginning of the transaction try , and returns its most recently committed value .
Locking a Ref is done by setting its tinfo field to a LockingTransaction .
Info object that describes the current transaction .
In order to ensure that only one transaction is able to do this , a write lock for the Ref is acquired near the beginning of this method and it is released at the end .
Recall that a write lock can only be acquired from a ReentrantReadWriteLock object if no thread holds its read or write lock .
If the ensure function was called on the Ref earlier in the current transaction try then a read lock for the Ref is already held .
The releaseIfEnsured method is called on the Ref to release that read lock so that the write lock can be acquired .
If the Ref has a value that was committed after the current transaction try began ( called the " read point " ) , it triggers a retry of the current transaction .
Next it checks whether the Ref has been modified in a concurrently running transaction .
If so , it attempts to barge the other transaction .
If that fails , it triggers a retry of the current transaction .
Otherwise it marks that Ref as being locked by the current transaction by setting the tinfo field of the Ref to refer to the LockingTransaction .
Info object for the current transaction and returns its most recently committed value .
It ends by releasing the write lock that was obtained at the beginning of the method .
The lock method is called from the doSet method .
releaseIfEnsured
This method takes a Ref .
If the ensure function has been called on the Ref during the current transaction try , the Ref is removed from the ensures field set and the read lock for the Ref ( obtained during the earlier ensure ) is released .
Otherwise the method does nothing .
This is called by the lock and run methods .
run
This method is the heart of Clojure STM .
It takes a Callable object that represents the code from the body of the transaction that will be executed inside a transaction .
It starts by creating an empty list of Refs that are locked and an empty list of Notify objects .
Notify is a static class defined in the same source file .
Instances hold a Ref , its old value and its new value .
They are used to notify watchers that the value of a Ref has changed .
This method then enters a loop that manages transaction retries .
The loop exits if the transaction completes successfully , the maximum number of retries is performed ( 10,000 ) , or an exception other than retry exception ( RetryEx ) is thrown .
The body of the loop contains one try block with a catch for RetryEx and a finally block .
The catch does n't contain any code and simply allows execution to return to the top of the loop for a potential retry .
The finally block is discussed later .
Inside the loop , the readPoint is incremented .
This acts as a unique identifier for all the reads of Refs that occur in the current transaction try .
If this is the first try for the current transaction , the startPoint is set to the readPoint and the startTime of the transaction is captured .
The status of the transaction is stored in an Info object .
Info is a static class defined in the same source file .
Instances hold a status , a start point and a latch whose use was described earlier .
Valid status values are RUNNING , COMMITTING , RETRY , KILLED and COMMITTED .
The status is set to RUNNING near the beginning of each try loop iteration .
Still in the loop , the Callable passed as a argument is called .
This executes the expressions that were in the body of the dosync .
Typically more than one Ref is read or dereferenced in this code and sometimes one or more Refs are modified , thus the need for a transaction .
After the body is successfully executed , the status is checked to verify that no other thread has barged this transaction .
That changes the status from RUNNING to KILLED .
If the transaction has not been killed then , atomically as part of the status check , the status is changed from RUNNING to COMMITTING .
Now the process of committing the transaction begins .
This involves four major steps .
The first step is to rerun all the commute functions .
The second step is to obtain a write lock for every Ref that was modified .
The third step is to verify that the validator of every Ref that was modified approves of the change .
The fourth step is to commit the change to each modified Ref .
The first commit step iterates though each of the Refs that were commuted .
If during the current transaction ref-set or alter was called on the Ref before commute was called on it then its commute functions are not called again and no further processing of the current Ref is performed in this step .
This is because commute has already been run on what will become the newest value of the Ref .
If ensure was called on the Ref in this transaction then the current transaction already holds a read lock for the Ref and that is released .
Next , a write lock is acquired for the Ref and the Ref is added to a list of Refs ( in the local variable locked ) that are locked by the current transaction .
Note that write locks are acquired for the Refs in the order in which the Ref objects were created .
This avoids deadlock in case another transaction is concurrently attempting to commit changes made to the same Refs using commute .
If the Ref was ensured in this transaction and a new value was committed since this transaction try began then a retry of the current transaction is triggered .
This will happen if another transaction commits a change to the Ref after the current transaction starts , but before ensure is called on it .
Question :
Why allow ensure to be called if this is the case ?
It then checks to see if another running transaction has made an in-transaction change to the Ref .
If so , it attempts to barge that transaction .
If this fails then a retry is triggered for the current transaction .
Otherwise , it obtains the newest committed value of the Ref and saves it as its in - transaction value for the current transaction .
Finally , each commute function for the Ref is called , passing it the in-transaction value of the Ref and any additional arguments that were passed to the commute function the first time it was called .
The in - transaction value of the Ref is replaced by the value returned from the commute function .
In the second commit step , a write lock is acquired for each Ref that was modified in the transaction body .
If any requested write lock cannot be acquired then the current transaction will retry .
In the third commit step , the validator function of every modified Ref that has one is called .
If any validator function disapproves of the change being made to its Ref then the current transaction will retry .
In the fourth commit step , changes to Refs are written to their history chains .
Either a new TVal object is added to the beginning of the chain or the oldest TVal object in the chain ( the last one ) is changed to become the beginning of the chain and it takes on the new value .
A new TVal object is added if any of the following are true :
The length of the history chain is currently zero .
The length of the history chain is less than the value of minHistory for the Ref .
At least one fault has occurred for this Ref since the last time the fault count was reset to zero and the length of the history chain is less than the value of maxHistory for the Ref .
If the modified Ref has any watchers , a Notify object is created which describes the change .
This contains the Ref that changed , its old value and its new value .
The Notify objects are collected in a list .
The watchers are n't actually notified until the finally block is reached .
The finally block performs cleanup steps for the transaction .
It releases all the write locks acquired for Refs back in the second commit step .
It releases all the read locks acquired by ensures that were n't released in the first commit step .
This is necessary for Refs on which ensure was called , but ref-set , alter and commute were never called .
It then calls stop to change the status of the transaction .
If completing successfully , the status is changed to COMMITTED .
Otherwise it is changed to RETRY .
If any Notify objects were created then it passes the old and new value from each to the watchers of the corresponding Refs .
If any actions were sent to Agents inside the transaction , it dispatches them .
If the RETRY_LIMIT is exceeded then a generic checked exception is thrown and no more retries are attempted .
runInTransaction
( static )
This accepts a Callable object that represents the anonymous function that was passed from the sync macro .
There is one ThreadLocal LockingTransaction object per thread .
If one has n't been created yet for the current thread , this method creates it .
If the LockingTransaction has already started running then the call method is simply invoked on the Callable .
This is how an inner transaction joins or is composed into an outer transaction ( nested dosync calls ) .
Otherwise the Callable object is passed to the run method of the LockingTransaction object to run in a new transaction .
stop
This method changes the status of the transaction to a given value and signals that the change has completed by decrementing the latch in its Info object to zero .
The blockAndBail method waits for this .
It then clears data associated with the LockingTransaction .
This includes setting the info field to null and clearing the vals , sets and commutes collections .
Note that the ensures collection is not cleared .
This means that the read locks acquired by calling ensure on a Ref are retained across transaction tries .
Question :
Is retaining those locks across retries intentional ?
Question :
Why is n't the actions collection cleared ?
Could n't this result in actions being invoked more than once if a transaction has to retry ?
When a transaction completes , the stop method is called on it .
This sets the status of the transaction to either COMMITTED or RETRY .
tryWriteLock
This method takes a Ref .
It tries for up to LOCK_WAIT_MSECS ( 1/10th of a second ) to acquire a write lock for the Ref .
If this fails due to the read or write lock being held by another thread ( in which case the timeout will expire ) or the current thread being interrupted , a retry of the current transaction is triggered .
This method is called by the lock and run methods .
STM implementations are somewhat complicated .
However , developing applications that use STM is less complicated and easier to get correct than using a lock - based approach .
It seems likely that over time using STM will become as common and trusted as using garbage collection is today .
Watch for updates to this article as the Clojure STM implementation improves , eventually being replaced by an implementation written in Clojure instead of Java .

Ritholtz apparently suspects more will be coming out on this in the coming days ...
Ok .
* Other possibilities of wrongdoing include the collapse of the oil market , fomenting dissent in Western China , and the death of Michael Jackson ( which Goldman may or may not have orchestrated in order to decrease order volume on that day ) .
“ Do n’t put bounderies to love ” ( from an advertisement from seven NGO ’s published in Ha’aretz on 16 July 2004 .
Today , 21 July 2004 , Adalah submitted a motion for injunction order to the Supreme Court requesting the temporary suspension of the Nationality and Entry into Israel Law ( Temporary Order ) – 2003 ( the law ) pending final ruling in the August 2003 petition against the law .
The Knesset today extended the law for six more months by a majority vote of 60 to 29 .
The law prohibits the granting of any residency or citizenship status to Palestinians from the occupied Palestinian territories who are married to Israeli citizens , thereby banning family unification .
The law bars Palestinians from the OPTs from obtaining any residency status or citizenship in Israel through marriage to an Israeli citizen , thereby prohibiting them from living in Israel with their spouses .
The law has already affected thousands of married couples and their children living in Israel , as well as newly married couples , and has forced families to separate or emigrate .
“ The citizenship law tears man from wife and children from their parents .
The law is racist and inhumane .
It must not be allowed to pass , ” a text from an advertisement published in the Israeli daily Ha’aretz on July 16 , 2004 .
MOI
Adalah attorney Orna Kohn argued in the motion for injunction order that the extension of the law will further exacerbate the existing infringement on basic constitutional rights , owing to the fact that , “ the longer the infringement goes on , the harsher the damage inflicted , since forced separation between a parent and child , man and wife , becomes harder to bear the longer it continues . ”
Adalah also stressed that families have already de facto been damaged by forced separation prior to the passing of the law as a result of the previous government decision of 12 May 2002 .
Some families have even been affected since March 2002 , by an earlier decision of the Minister of the Interior ( ) .
Thus , the violation of the basic constitutional rights of all of these families has been going on for over two years .
Moreover , today ’s vote contradicts what the Attorney General ( AG ) has previously stated before the Supreme Court in response to the petition filed on 3 August 2003 by Adalah , which asked the Supreme Court to declare the law unconstitutional and therefore void .
In his response , the AG argued that the law is constitutional and proportionate , because it would remain in effect for only one year , emphasizing its temporary nature .
In addition , Adalah contended in the motion that the government and the parliament did not present any information to justify the extension of the law , given the severity of the violation of constitutional rights which it inflicts .
Finally , Adalah argued that extending the law will cause severe and potentially irreversible damage and suffering to the families affected .
In contrast , no damage will be sustained by the respondents if the Court temporarily suspends the law , as the graduated process of granting status in Israel , according to Article 7 of the Citizenship Law – 1952 are still in effect for non-Israeli spouses .
This process allows the MOI to reject applications for family unification on an individual basis for various reasons including security concerns .
After Adalah petitioned the Supreme Court on 3 August 2003 , six more petitions were submitted and are currently pending before the Supreme Court against the law .
The petitions were filed by Adalah , in its own name and on behalf of two families , the High Follow - up Committee for Arab Citizens in Israel , and Arab Members of Knesset ( MKs ) ; the Meretz political party ; the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ; and by private lawyers on behalf of individual families against the Minister of Interior and the AG .
The Supreme Court has joined these petitions for hearings and decision .
Adalah ’s main argument against the new law , as set forth in the petition , is that it severely violates the constitutionally - protected rights to equality , personal liberty to maintain a family life , privacy , dignity , in accordance with the Basic Law : Human Dignity and Liberty – 1992 .
The law limits the ability of Israeli citizens , namely Arab citizens of Israel – the overwhelming majority of the citizens who marry Palestinians from the Occupied Territories – to exercise these rights based solely on the ethnicity of their spouses .
Further , the law is discriminatory as it applies only to Palestinians ; family unification and naturalization remain available to all other foreign spouses of Israeli citizens .
Thus , the law does not merely discriminate on the basis of nationality or ethnicity ; it is blatantly racist .
The law therefore contravenes international law , which prohibits discrimination based on national belonging , specifically with regard to the right to citizenship , as well as international treaties to which Israel is a party .
The state has claimed that that the ban on family unification was necessary and directed against all Palestinians , as they support the resistance against Israel , and thus are potential terrorists .
Although the state argued that 23 people of the many thousands of status - receivers were suspected of indirect involvement in terrorist actions , none of these was directly involved in any actual terror activity .
Adalah argued in its petition and in its final arguments that the state ’s contention that three million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza all constitute a danger to the state is racist and indefensible , as asserting that all Palestinians are potential terrorists , defames and vilifies the entire Palestinian nation .
Further , the state ’s attempts to justify the law on the grounds of terror activity by residents of the West Bank and Gaza granted status in Israel through family unification , relies on data which is insufficient and inconsistent .
Further , even if the state ’s data is reliable , the law is completely disproportionate given the fact that , even according to the state , very few individuals were involved in terror , while the law will violate the fundamental rights of many thousands of innocent families .
A three - judge panel of the Supreme Court held a hearing on the petitions in November 2003 .
A second hearing on the petitions was held in January 2004 , challenging the constitutionality of the law before an enlarged panel of 13 justices .
The Court has issued an order nisi and injunctions preventing the deportation of three of the petitioners , pending a final ruling on the petition .

The Space family & the Blunt family get
great health coverage that we pay for
" I am preparing an amendment to make it clear that this legislation is not designed to benefit those persons who are undocumented , " Space , D - Ohio , said during a conference call Thursday .
" It should benefit only those who are American citizens .
" There has been a lot of concern among the public about this issue , and I want to make sure the beneficiaries of this legislation are tax - paying Americans . "
Under his amendment , those applying for government - funded health insurance would have to show proof of citizenry - just as is currently required by those receiving Medicare , according to Space .
The amendment , offered by Rep. Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , Reps. Joe Pitts ( R - Pa. ) and Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , originally passed 31 to 27 .
Republicans voted unanimously for the measure .
On the Democratic side , all but one Blue Dog-- Rep. Zack Space ( D - Ohio ) who did not vote–supported the amendment .
( " I just missed the first vote , " said Space , who went on to vote against the amendment . )
But before the first round of voting closed , Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) changed his vote from NO to YES .
The switch let him to take advantage of a House rule that allows supporters to bring an amendment back for consideration later .
The tactic paid off : Waxman brought the amendment up for another vote , and the committee defeated it 30 - 29 .
The amendment would have prevented the public plan from covering abortion unless the mother 's life was at risk .
" I misunderstood it the first time , " said Rep. Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn . ) , who originally voted for the amendment but opposed against it the second time around .

Perhaps you heard about how Blue Dogs are doing Republicans ' work for them by watering down the health care bill as much as possible .
The slimy Ohio Blue Dog who took over for Republican Bob Ney when he was caught accepting bribes and was shipped off to prison is Zack Space .
Space could n't wait to run to the media to take credit for barring immigrants from getting any benefits from whatever comes out of the health care reform bill he 's helping the GOP eviscerate .
Good thing Lou Dobbs was lying as usual when he made up all that crazy nonsense about how immigrants are bringing leprosy to America !
Otherwise Space might be condemning schoolchildren in Chillicothe , Zanesville and New Rumley to falling off toes and fingers and a life without noses , just so he could seem like even more of a Republican than he already has been since being elected in 2006 .
But keeping immigrants from getting medical treatment is n't all that the Blue Dogs been obsessed with .
They and their reactionary allies on the other side of the aisle are also trying to make sure women 's reproductive health is controlled by politicians like themselves , rather than by doctors and women .
On Thursday night the Blue Dog- infested House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment that would bar women 's reproductive health from being part of the public option .
Fortunately , committee chair Henry Waxman was paying close attention and figured out how to counter the Republicans and their Blue Dog cronies .
I wonder what got Gordon to come around .
He has a disgraceful voting record on women 's reproductive health and certainly votes like an anti-choice nutcase most of the time .
Anyway ... " nice " that Space is n't trying to penalize most women , only immigrants .
By the way , as long as we 're talking about health care and Mr. Space , his district is one of the poorest in Ohio .
( The medium income in Ohio is $ 40,956 but in OH - 18 it 's only $ 34,462 . )
The Center For American Progress took a look at the need for health care reform across Ohio ; the need is even greater in Space 's district but here 's what they found for the whole state :
And what about Missouri , where Roy Blunt is now the congressman charged by the GOP leadership with killing health care reform -- while he is busy running for senator from that state ?
And , remember , the anti-choice provision that was beaten back by Waxman 's quick wit was sponsored by Blunt , a raging anti-choice fanatic .
Blunt is one of the House members who has benefited most from the legalized bribes given to " cooperative " members of Congress by the Medical - Industrial Complex .
He 's taken $ 1,660,898 from them and another $ 556,682 from Big Insurance .
He expects them to pick up a major part of the tab for his Senate election bid next year and he 's working his ass off to destroy health care reform hoping people in Missouri will be taken in by the barrage of lies being put out in the form of twisted TV ads .
Meanwhile here 's CAP 's assessement of the health care need in Blunt 's own state : Blunt and his latest wife Abigail get the best health insurance and the best health care available on the planet -- courtesy of the American taxpayers -- so when he , and the rest of the Republican swine and their filthy Blue Dog allies , say they do n't believe in government - sponsored health care , remember , they just do n't believe in it for us ; theyit for themselves and their families .
They like things just the they are ; do you ?

Five percent ( 5 % ) of the richest Americans own 95 % of corporate stocks .
This means that five percent ( 5 % ) are reaping excessive and outrageous profits from a forsaking of the American workforce .
Meanwhile , the vast majority of Americans are unemployed or underemployed .
Those who are underemployed are being compensated anywhere between 20 % - 70 % less in wages than their prior incomes .
Yet , we continue to see very large increases in consumer goods and services from anything as small as vegetables and milk to large ticket items such as cars , homes , and college education expenses .
What has occurred over the past three decades in the United States ?
More skilled jobs that demand higher levels of education and more technical skills have been shipped overseas creating what has been called “ the brain drain . ”
American workers with years of higher level education , greater skills , and more experience are being replaced by either automation or by low income and unemployed foreigners who are glad to work for 1/10 or 1/20 of the pay that an American demands .
These leaves mostly semi-skilled and unskilled workers in America such as retail salespeople , waiters and waitresses , health aides , and janitors , all in the lower paying sector .
In addition to this , American corporations have hired part - time workers and independent contractors in order to avoid having to provide healthcare .
Yet the executives in the company have very attractive and robust health and welfare benefits .
The majority of U.S. part - time workers are women who earn 69 % of what males earn .
One projection is that , by the year 2014 , there will be around 38 million people who will be job hunting in underdeveloped countries , adding to the already one billion plus people across the world who are unemployed and underemployed .
In a November 2003 study by Alliance Capital Management which reviewed manufacturing jobs in the world ’s twenty largest economies , it showed that , between 1995 and 2002 , a total of 31 million manufacturing jobs were eliminated due mostly to advanced technology replacing the need for human beings .
One example serves to highlight this .
In 2002 , Sprint ’s productivity rose 15 percent and revenue increased 4.3 percent , yet the company eliminated 11,500 workers from its payroll .
Jeremy Rifkin , author of The End of Work : The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post - Market Era , says that , of all the CEOs he has had discussions with , most agreed that intelligent technology , not human beings , will make up the workforce of the future .
In 1995 , the rate at which U.S. corporations were eliminating jobs was two million annually .
More than 75 percent of workers in most of the industrial nations are performing work that is primarily simple and repetitive .
As of 2003 , in the United States , out of 124 million workers , more than 90 million jobs were at risk for replacement by machines .
As of the early 1990s , approximately 3.6 billion people ( 67 % ) in the world lacked adequate cash or credit to purchase goods and services .
As Barnet and Cavanagh ( 1994 ) state : “ A huge and increasing proportion of human beings are not needed and will never be needed to make goods or to provide services because too many people in the world are too poor to buy them ” ( p. 17 ) .
With automated machinery and robots taking over , there is the very real possibility of a permanent underclass consisting of hundreds of millions , if not several billion people .
Nobel laureate , Wassily Leontief , states that “ the role of humans as the most important factor of production is bound to diminish the same way that the role of horses in agricultural production was first diminished and then eliminated by the introduction of tractors . ”
This unprecedented global travesty will create a worldwide situation in which upwards of 80 % of the world will be unemployed or underemployed .
With several billion people unable to find work , what will prevent society from disintegrating into a state of perpetual lawlessness and chaos ?
Other ominous predictions regarding robots include the concern that when artificial intelligence is developed , these robots may be given similar rights to humans , including the right to vote .
Japanese Professor Ishiguro has created a human android that is so eerily like a real human being that , one day , the unreal will be indiscernible from a real human being .
In December 2006 , one of 200 studies commissioned by the British government was published which stated , “ If granted full rights , states will be obligated to provide full social benefits to them [ robots ] including income support , housing and possibly robo- healthcare to fix the machines over time . ”
While it was nay - sayed by most in the scientific community , the fact that it surfaced is alarming .
One scientist commented on his concern about who would be responsible if a robot kills or injures someone saying , “ We need a proper debate about the safety of the robots that will come onto the market in the next few years .
Military use of robots is increasing fast .
What we should really be bothered about is public safety . ”
Bill Joy , co-founder of Sun Microsystems , wrote an article in Wired magazine in 2000 which very clearly elucidates the extreme ethical and moral dangers of technology , and specifically robotics , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology .
Perhaps one of the most frightening about all three is that they can self - replicate which , as Joy points out , carries with it great power .
In Joy ’s article , he talks about the book , The Age of Spiritual Machines , written by Ray Kurzweil , the famous inventor of the first reading machine for the blind .
In the book , Kurzweil advocates for a utopian world in which human immortality is attained by becoming one with robotic technology .
The following frightening scenario is printed in the book :
THE NEW LUDDITE CHALLENGE
First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better than human beings can do them .
In that case presumably all work will be done by vast , highly organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary .
Either of two cases might occur .
The machines might be permitted to make all of their own decisions without human oversight , or else human control over the machines might be retained .
If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions , we ca n’t make any conjectures as to the results , because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave .
We only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines .
It might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all the power to the machines .
But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power .
What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines ’ decisions .
As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent , people will let machines make more of their decisions for them , simply because machine - made decisions will bring better results than man -made ones .
Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently .
At that stage the machines will be in effective control .
People wo n’t be able to just turn the machines off , because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide .
On the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may be retained .
In that case the average man may have control over certain private machines of his own , such as his car or his personal computer , but control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite – just as it is today , but with two differences .
Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses ; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous , a useless burden on the system .
If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity .
If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct , leaving the world to the elite .
Or , if the elite consists of soft - hearted liberals , they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race .
They will see to it that everyone ’s physical needs are satisfied , that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions , that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy , and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes “ treatment ” to cure his “ problem . ”
Of course , life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or make them “ sublimate ” their drive for power into some harmless hobby .
These engineered human beings may be happy in such a society , but they will most certainly not be free .
They will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals .
Kurzweil had included in his book ideas that Theodore Kaczynski , the Unabomber , had written about a dystopian society .
Joy goes on to say that he found Hans Moravec ’s book , Robot : Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind , and it gave him more cause for concern .
Moravec is a leaders in robotics research as well as the founder of the world ’s largest robotics research program at Carnegie Mellon University .
In Joy ’s ( 2000 ) article , he provides an excerpt from Moravec ’s book that is similar to Kaczynski ’s disturbing vision .
The Short Run ( Early 2000s )
Biological species almost never survive encounters with superior competitors .
Ten million years ago , South and North America were separated by a sunken Panama isthmus .
South America , like Australia today , was populated by marsupial mammals , including pouched equivalents of rats , deers , and tigers .
When the isthmus connecting North and South America rose , it took only a few thousand years for the northern placental species , with slightly more effective metabolisms and reproductive and nervous systems , to displace and eliminate almost all the southern marsupials .
In a completely free marketplace , superior robots would surely affect humans as North American placentals affected South American marsupials ( and as humans have affected countless species ) .
Robotic industries would compete vigorously among themselves for matter , energy , and space , incidentally driving their price beyond human reach .
Unable to afford the necessities of life , biological humans would be squeezed out of existence .
There is probably some breathing room , because we do not live in a completely free marketplace .
Government coerces nonmarket behavior , especially by collecting taxes .
Judiciously applied , governmental coercion could support human populations in high style on the fruits of robot labor , perhaps for a long while .
These excerpts written by men echo the profoundly disturbing , dominating , and destructive quality that is inherent in masculine pathology , particularly in psychopathy in which there is a complete objectification of humankind , and an absence of human compassion and moral conscience .
It has eery commonality with the story of Frankenstein : The Modern Prometheus published in 1818 by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley in which man , egomaniacally obsessed with power and control , creates that which destroys him .
This is a psychopath — a man with no heart ; essentially , a beast .
Joy ’s ( 2000 ) article is his vocalization of the extremely dangerous and unprecedented potential for extinction that exists as pertains to threats from technology , especially robotics .
He emphatically states that “ certain knowledge is too dangerous and is best forgone ” ( p. 11 ) .
The reason for his urge for moral caution is best summed up when he states :
By 2030 , we are likely to be able to build machines , in quantity , a million times as powerful as the personal computers of today …
And once an intelligent robot exists , it is only a small step to a robot species — to an intelligent robot that can make evolved copies of itself …
A second dream of robotics is that we will gradually replace ourselves with our robotic technology , achieving near immortality by downloading our consciousnesses …
I think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil , an evil whose possibility spreads well beyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the nation - states , on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme individuals .
Jacques Attali , French minister and technology consultant to former president Francois Mitterand , declared : “ Machines are the new proletariat .
The working class is being given its walking papers . ”
This is one reason for large increases in productivity despite the fact the employees are working harder than ever and putting in longer hours , and even though large numbers of workers have been laid off .
With the elimination of layers of traditional management , shortening production processes , and streamlining administrative duties , restructuring and layoffs in corporations can result in a 40 % to 75 % workforce reduction .
American workers have been left standing at the curbside for decades holding the proverbial bag .
They are paying more for the cost of those products and services which the corporation is producing for an estimated 30 % - 70 % less cost due , in large part , to massive savings in the cost of labor as corporations lay off U.S. workers and hire cheap labor from foreign countries at a rate up to 90 % of the cost of labor in the U.S. Meanwhile , the compensation of U.S. executives continues to escalate and skyrocket into the tens and hundreds of millions per executive .
In addition , this creates a financial windfall for CEOs , senior executives , and the 5 % who own stock in these corporations that are saving 60 - 90 % in labor costs .
Corporations have betrayed the American workers and have done so without many people being aware of the enormity of the betrayals .
Because multi-nationals own virtually all major and mainstream media outlets , they have , for the most part over the past three decades , hid any news that was unfavorable to corporations and the wealthy elite .
Hidden from front page or headline news in these mainstream media sources such as CBS , NBC , ABC , CNN , and Fox News was any news that had the potential to incite large groups of people to unite , engage , and oppose their agenda .
The media did not inform the public , to any large degree , about the mass drain of labor out of America that began in the late 1980s .
It was not until the early 21st century that large numbers of Americans became aware of the scope of the numbers of lost jobs as well as the fact that the hiring of overseas labor had been occurring for well over a decade .
Some of this increased awareness was due to internet access which has non-mainstream sources that provides what many consider are far more accurate pictures and data that are representative of contemporary financial , social , cultural and psychological reality .
The wealthiest power brokers have been very aware of the threat that the internet plays in the potential to educate and inform tens and hundreds of millions of people across the world .
More crucially , they are cognizant of the potential that this creates for a worldwide organization and uniting of people against what has now become , when combined with overpopulation and global warming , the psychosocial pathology of free market capitalism .

The vote was the first time either house of Congress had approved a bill meant to curb the heat - trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change .
The legislation , which passed despite deep divisions among Democrats , could lead to profound changes in many sectors of the economy , including electric power generation , agriculture , manufacturing and construction .
The bill ’s passage , by 219 to 212 , with 44 Democrats voting against it , also established a marker for the United States when international negotiations on a new climate change treaty begin later this year .
At the heart of the legislation is a cap - and - trade system that sets a limit on overall emissions of heat - trapping gases while allowing utilities , manufacturers and other emitters to trade pollution permits , or allowances , among themselves .
The cap would grow tighter over the years , pushing up the price of emissions and presumably driving industry to find cleaner ways of making energy .

Ellie Greenwich was praised throughout her songwriting career
American songwriter Ellie Greenwich , who penned River Deep , Mountain High and other hits , has died , aged 68 .
She died of a heart attack after being admitted to a New York hospital for pneumonia treatment , her niece said .
In a 50 - year career , she was awarded some 25 gold and platinum discs .
She collaborated with Phil Spector on Chapel of Love and Da Doo Ron Ron .
She wrote Leader of the Pack with her ex-husband , which became the basis for a Broadway musical based on her life .
Greenwich was a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and contributed to the success of many stars , including working with Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald .
She is also co-produced songs for Neil Diamond , including his hit Kentucky Woman .
Other compositions included Do Wah Diddy Diddy and Look of Love .
Intellectual giants Senator Sam Brownback ( R - KS ) and Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) have introduced the Human - Animal Hybrid Protection
Act of 2009 to stem the growing market for centaurs , harpies , satyrs , mermaids and other animal - human hybrid freaks .
“ This legislation works to ensure that our society recognizes the dignity and sacredness of human life , ” said Brownback .
“ Creating human - animal hybrids , which permanently alter the genetic makeup of an organism , will challenge the very definition of what it means to be human and is a violation of human dignity and a grave injustice . ”
This important piece of legislation is co-sponsored by nearly 20 other like - minded individuals who refuse to blur the lines between man and beast , and should be the Senate ’s top priority .
Prohibiting mad scientists from creating man-beasts is so much more important than health care or any of those other trifles the Senate is currently debating .
Give me a break .
Granted there is some legitimate research going on in Britain , but it is not as the bible - thumping conservatives would present it .

I ’ve been into Scala lately .
More about it will follow later , but there ’s something I found out which I really like .
Last couple of days I wrote some very basic Scala snippets , containing constructs which would be non-trivial or ‘ unusual ’ to write in Java , compile it to a class file , and then use a Java decompiler to figure out how the Scala compiler maps those constructs to JVM bytecodes .
There ’s one thing which took my attention : looks like ( basic ) tail - recursive functions are optimized into while - loops !
This only happens if the last call of a function is a call to itself ( the most basic form of tail recursion ) , but it ’s an interesting feature anyway …
No more need to put socket accept handling in an infinite while loop
A little demo .
First , here ’s a Scala object which implements a very basic ‘ reduce ’ function :
object Reducer { def reduce [ T , V ] ( fun : ( V , T ) => V , values : List [ T ] , initial : V ) : V = { if ( values is Empty ) return initial val next = fun( initial , values head ) return reduce ( fun , values tail , next ) } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) :
Unit = { val values = List ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) val sum = reduce [ Int , Int ] ( ( x , y ) => x + y , values , 0 ) println ( " Result : " + sum ) } }
We can compile and run this , and it ’ll output the expected result ’ 10 ′ :
MacBook : reduce nicolas $ scalac Reducer.scala MacBook : reduce nicolas $ scala Reducer Result : 10
Now we can open the generated class files in JD .
There are a couple of them ( it ’s interesting to take a look at all of them and figure out what they represent exactly ) , but in this case we need ‘ Reducer$.class ’ , which contains the implementations of our public functions , including ‘ reduce ’ .
Here ’s the Java version of the ‘ reduce ’ function :
public < T , V> V reduce ( Function2 < V , T , V > fun , List < T> values , V initial ) { while ( true ) { if ( values.isEmpty ( ) ) return initial ; Object next = fun.apply ( initial , values.head ( ) ) ; initial = next ; values = values.tail ( ) ; } }
‘ Function2 ′ is a built - in Scala type which represents a function taking 2 parameters .
As you can see , this code does exactly the same as our Scala version and is most likely the way we ’d write the code manually as well ( the only thing I do n’t get is why ‘ next ’ is an Object and not a ‘ V’ , I might figure that out later ) , but without forcing us to write the imperative code , whilst still producing bytecodes which will most likely show the best performance on the JVM ( which currently has no tail recursion optimization support ( although that might change one day ) ) .
I like it
[ update ]
For reference , here ’s a slightly more Scala-ish implementation of reduce , showing the same time performance characteristics during some basic profiling .
I was not able to get JD nor jad to generate any usable decompiled code though :
def reduce [ T , V ] ( fun : ( V , T ) => V , values : List [ T ] , initial : V ) : V = { values match { case List ( ) => initial ; case head :: tail => reduce ( fun , tail , fun( initial , head ) ) } }
It uses Scala ’s “ List ” pattern matching functionality .
Non-native Kindergarteners Learn Vocabulary Faster Than Native English - speakers With The Right Lessons
ScienceDaily ( Apr. 27 , 2007 ) 
An important study from The Elementary School Journal explores vocabulary development at the kindergarten level among English - only students ( EOs ) and English - language - learning students ( ELLs ) who speak another language at home .
Analyzing rates of target word acquisition and overall vocabulary development , the study found that students learning English as a second language picked up general vocabulary more quickly and target vocabulary words at the same rate as native English - speaking kindergarteners .
" This study contributes to knowledge about vocabulary instruction by investigating the effects of a vocabulary intervention with children from a variety of backgrounds , " writes Rebecca Deffes Silverman , who conducted the research while at Harvard University and is now at the University of Maryland .
Past studies have identified vocabulary as the " single most encountered obstacle " for English - language - learning students , Silverman points out , and vocabulary is also the primary determinant of future reading comprehension .
Taking into account that kindergarteners comprehend oral language instruction at a much higher rate than they can read , Silverman developed and implemented a multidimensional vocabulary program incorporating storybook reading and opportunities to say vocabulary words aloud in five kindergarten classrooms .
Three of the classrooms were mainstream English , in which both English - only kindergarteners and English - language learners were enrolled .
One was structured immersion , in which only ELLs were enrolled .
The last classroom was bilingual Spanish - English , attended by both EO and ELL children .
After fourteen weeks , English - language - learning students knew 19 more words on a picture vocabulary assessment than they knew before the program , while native English - speaking students knew 14 more words than before .
Similarly , on an oral vocabulary test , English - language - learning kindergarteners could provide definitions for 21 more words than they could before the program , compared to 17 more definitions for the native English - speaking kindergarteners .
Also , though native English - speaking kindergarteners knew more of the target words before the program , there was no difference in knowledge of target words between the English - learning and English - only kindergarteners either immediately after the program or during follow - up six weeks later .
" My study shows that ELLs can grow in general vocabulary at a faster rate than EOs , " writes Silverman .
" This may indicate that ELLs can eventually catch up to EOs in overall vocabulary knowledge , and it may also suggest that the structure of vocabulary intervention could provide the instructional focus that leads to narrowing the language gap between ELLs and EOs . "
1 ) Please provide the information which confirms to what degree , and upon what lawful basis regarding the ‘ duty of care ’ the Minister can assure New Zealand that the Baxter A / H1N1 influenza vaccine has been adequately tested before its release in NZ .
2 ) Given that Baxter was recently found to have contaminated its seasonal influenza ( H3N2 ) vaccine with live H5N1 avian “ bird flu ” influenza virus , please provide the information which explains why the Ministry of Health decided to choose Baxter as the supplier of influenza vaccine for New Zealand for the A / H1N1 “ swine flu ” influenza outbreak .
3 ) If the Ministry of Health was unaware of Baxter ’s record of manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine contaminated with live avian H5N1 ( or bird flu ) influenza virus when the order with Baxter was placed , now that the Minister is aware fact that Baxter either has criminally negligent manufacturing practices , or intentionally produced contaminated seasonal influenza vaccine , please provide the information which confirms why the Ministry of Health is not planning to cancel the order for A / H1N1 vaccine from Baxter International .
4 ) Given Baxter ’s record of distributing of seasonal influenza vaccine contaminated with live avian influenza virus , in the event that the Minister still considers Baxter to be a suitable supplier of A / H1N1 vaccine to New Zealand , please provide the information which confirms what steps has he put in place for independent NZ - based testing of the vaccine prior to its use here to ensure that the vaccine supplied to NZers is not contaminated with live bird flu virus , or any other unlabelled contaminant that may cause adverse health effects to the recipient or people to whom the recipient could potentially infect .
5 ) Please provide the information which confirms how scientists with appropriate and relevant skills and experience will be selected to undertake this testing so that those who are not suitable ( such as those who may have a conflict of interest in terms of prior relationships with Baxter or competing pharmaceutical companies , ownership of shares in these companies , a personal record of poor professional ethics such as failing to disclose previous conflicts of interest , support for global population reduction or eugenics etc ) can be excluded to ensure that the testing of the vaccine can be done properly and without bias .
6 ) Please provide the information which confirms the existence of a ‘ Register of Interests ’ ( or the like ) , for ALL persons directly employed , or contracted by the Ministry of Health where potential ‘ conflicts of interest ’ , are identified and recorded , such as :

b ) ownership of shares in pharmaceutical companies
8 ) Please provide the information which confirms that the Minister will guarantee to make the full results of any and all such testing public .
9 ) Given the consent forms produced by the Ministry of Health in many prior mass vaccination campaigns ( recently notable examples include the MeNZB campaign and the Gardasil campaign ) have failed to disclose to potential vaccine recipients ( and / or their parents / guardians ) significant information that is necessary in order to make an informed decision please provide the information which confirms that the Minister will undertake to ensure that consent forms given to people who are offered the A / H1N1 vaccine are comprehensive , accurate and are designed in such a way to facilitate people making an informed choice about whether or not to accept this vaccine , rather than be designed to frighten people into accepting this vaccine .
10 ) Please provide the information which confirms that the Minister will guarantee that any consent forms to be signed by potential recipients , parents or guardians will include information as to the processes used to manufacture the vaccine , all vaccine ingredients , all known and reasonably anticipated vaccine side effects and the duration of the vaccine ’s testing process and length of time that vaccine recipients have been followed up in safety studies , as well as the many different strategies available to prevent and / or treat the illness for individuals who decide against vaccination or if the vaccine fails to prevent the disease etc )
11 ) In the event that Baxter ’s inadequately tested A / H1N1 “ swine flu ” vaccine causes injuries or deaths to its recipients either in the short or long term , please provide the information which confirms the plans has the Minister has made to compensate affected individuals and their surviving family members .
12 ) In the event that the Minister decides to use Baxter ’s A /H1N1 vaccine without first conducting independent testing to ensure that it is free from live viruses ( or other contaminants ) and the use of Baxter ’s A / H1N1 vaccine causes an epidemic of a new strain of influenza or novel infectious disease , please provide the information which confirms what plans the Minister has made to compensate individuals ( who could become acutely or chronically ill , be left disabled or die ) either as a result of being injected with the vaccine or by contracting the infection from an individual who had been vaccinated with Baxter ’s A / H1N1 or a community contact who had contracted the infection from a vaccinee or someone else who had been in contact with a vaccinee .
13 ) Please provide the information which confirms the definition of the “ first responders ” to whom the 300,000 doses of Baxter ’s A / H1N1 vaccine have been purchased .

d ) Teachers ?
e ) Vulnerable groups in the community such as the elderly or young children ?
14 ) Please provide the information which confirms that the Minister can assure the NZ public that at no time during the WHO H1N1 pandemic will the human rights of “ first responders ” ( or any other group of people to whom Baxter ’s or any other manufacturer ’s H1N1 vaccine is offered ) will be respected and that vaccination will at no time become compulsory .
15 ) Please provide the information which confirms that the Minister can guarantee that people who decide against accepting the H1N1 vaccine will not suffer discrimination in the workplace such as suspension , change of duties , dismissal and that unvaccinated children will be allowed to continue to attend their normal pre-school or school as usual .
16 ) Considering that people who suffer from asthma are at greater risk of complications from influenza in general and that appropriate diet and nutritional supplements can help improve resistance to infection , reduce mucous in the airways and reduce inflammation , please provide the information which confirms that why the Minister has not made education about diet and nutritional medicine a basic part of asthma management rather than relying almost wholly on drug therapies for this chronic condition .

They ’re not real .
Corporate earnings , as interpreted by most analysts and journalists , are optimistic at best .
At worst they ’re just manipulated or phony .
So while I hate to keep harping on this issue , the latest wave of bullish Q2 profit headlines has motivated me to do so .
The perceptional - delusion index is near record highs .
Why so skeptical ?
Part of the problem is widespread use of “ operating income ” ( aka pro-forma or non -GAAP ) to support the bull - case .
This distorted version of earnings excludes many so - called “ nonrecurring ” costs .
Operating income is sold as being what a company would normally have earned .
You just have to ignore certain sections of their books .
Exhibit A : Intel
Take Intel ’s Q2 2009 press release , which touts “ non-GAAP operating income of $ 1.4 billion “ .
That number excludes a $ 1.45 billion fine from the EU .
Excluding this charge seems fairly reasonable at first .
I mean , how often does a continent slap a $ 1.45 b fine on you ?
But even when you exclude the $ 1.45 billion charge , “ operating income ” is still down $ 820 million from Q2 2008 .
You wo n’t find that in the bullet points .
The real problem is that these so - called “ nonrecurring ” events have become a regular quarterly tradition .
Since the 90’s , companies have shifted the focus to OE .
Common expenses , including fines , acquisition costs and investment losses are routinely excluded from headline numbers .
Take a look at the highlights from Intel ’s Q2 2008 release :
Operating Income up 67 Percent Year - over - Year
Net Income $ 1.6 Billion ; EPS 28 Cents
The emphasis is clearly on operating income .
Problems arise when the public starts basing their analysis on these numbers .
Journalists who want an eye - grabbing headline can simply run with “ Intel Income up 67 % ” .
Analysts are guilty of steering the focus towards operating earnings .
“ Nonrecurring ” charges , boom or bust
In boom - times companies can lump costs like stock options and acquisitions into the nonrecurring category .
During rough years , things like severance , layoffs and plant closings get dropped .
No matter the economic climate , earnings will be presented in a way that reflects best - possible - scenarios .
These “ nonrecurring ” or “ one - time ” costs are a part of doing business , and should be reflected as such in income statements .
Nonrecurring gains , you say ?
Oh yeah , let ’s include those .
Conversely , one - time gains are often highlighted in corporate press releases and media headlines .
Case in point : Visa ’s Q2 2009 report .
AP Headline : “ Visa quarterly profit jumps 73 percent ” .
But that includes a one time gain from a Brazilian investment IPO .
If you exclude it , the jump was 43 % from last year , a huge difference .
Differing from traditional reporting
Pseudo - earnings are NOT the norm historically .
Sweeping inconvenient charges under the rug is a fairly new phenomenon , which only took off during the 1990’s .
In 2001 the SEC even issued a warning against Pro Forma earning manipulation .
So next time you hear someone say what a bargain stocks are , or see a chart of historic P / Es , check the data .
If the methodology is not specified , assume the most optimistic multiples are being used .
Permabulls invariably use the rosier version .
Bears are also accused of using the version that supports our view .
But there ’s an important difference ;
Our version represents the actual bottom - line as traditionally measured .
It ’s not pessimistic , just realistic .
Effect on P/E Ratios and Historic Comparisons
According to most analysts and media , the S&P 500 currently trades at a P/E 0f ~ 16 .
Where they get this number , I do n’t know .
As we noted earlier this month , the real 12 - month trailing multiple is 134x ( as of June 30 2009 , according to S&P ) .
That ’s reported profits , aka real earnings , bottom - line .
David Pauly had a nice Bloomberg editorial today on the issue , with specific examples ( notably absent from the homepage , would n’t want to spoil the rally ) .
He puts most of the blame on analysts , but I think media shares it .
Excerpts :
In analystspeak , Intel Corp. was n’t hit with a $ 1.45 billion fine from the European Union in the second quarter for anticompetitive practices .
As Wall Street tells it , the employee stock options Google Inc. granted in the second quarter did n’t cost its shareholders $ 293 million .
By similar Wall Street reckoning , the expense of cutting jobs and selling an asset that reduced McGraw - Hill Cos. second quarter earnings per share by 10 percent was immaterial .

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
The second of two manufacturing purchasing managers indexes covering China showed the strongest growth in a year Monday , with the rise fueled by demand within the country rather than through exports .
CLSA Asia Pacific Markets said its China manufacturing PMI remained in expansionary territory for the fourth consecutive month in July , rising to 52.8 , up from 51.8 in June .
The expansion was the fastest since May 2008 , prompting manufacturing companies to recruit additional workers for the second straight month , CLSA said .
" Manufacturing activity continues to accelerate and importantly , orders growth is being driven by the internal economy , " said CLSA 's head of economic research Eric Fishwick .
Fishwick said export demand was " lackluster , " reflected in part by a weak pricing environment for exported goods .
The PMI showed companies lifted prices in July for the first time in almost a year .
It also found manufacturers recorded rises in input - price inflation for the first time since September .
The CLSA data came just days after the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing released its own PMI , showing a slight rise of 0.1 point in July to 53.3 .
The CFLP version , however , showed a more sizeable growth in export - driven demand , with new export orders up 0.7 % to 52.1 points .
See full story on CFLP 's China PMI for July .
High points
Standard Chartered said the data added to evidence that companies had finished drawing down inventories and were now submitting new orders for finished goods .
" This is a bullish signal for activity over the next few months , " wrote Standard Chartered economists headed by Stephen Green in Shanghai in a note Monday , pointing to a 2.2 % on - year fall in July inventories of finished goods .
However , Green also cautioned that the CFLP 's PMI remained below the average of 54.5 seen through 2005 and 2007 , which suggested growth in China 's manufacturing sector would be relatively muted .
Merrill Lynch said in a note Monday the CFLP PMI provided additional evidence the economy is on the mend , even though the headline figure was below its analysts ' forecast of 53.9 .
" It supports our view that China 's recovery is being solidified , " Merrill economists headed by Ting Lu said .
Merrill said it expects China 's economic growth will accelerate to 9.2 % in third quarter , and 11.3 % in the fourth .
The world ’s most profound movements begin with a great enlightenment .
People hear of this epiphany that changes lives , and become disciples to spread the word .
Over years and centuries these true believers form churches to meet and celebrate their beliefs and traditions while encountering opposition and persecution .
The cannabis culture has its own profound religion borne out of three important epiphanies that happened serendipitously around 1930 , and one more when religious prophet Bob Marley was born on February 6 , 1945 .
This cannabis religion requires a believer to consume and distribute cannabis as sacrament and medicine .
It acknowledges the prophecies of the Christian Old Testament , with an important nod to the New Testament .
It takes prophecies of the ancient biblical texts , fusing them with the liberation writings of African - American philosopher and activist Marcus Garvey .
This is the story of our great present - day cannabis religion and the sacrifice and struggle that brought it to the forefront of our movement .
Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea , discovered by Columbus in 1494 but occupied by the British beginning in 1655 .
For two hundred years African slaves , brought to Jamaica in slave ships from West Africa , worked the island ’s rich soil , producing more sugar for export back to England than any other place on earth .
By 1810 , England had abolished slavery , but the white plantation owners of Jamaica resisted British instructions to abolish slavery on Jamaican soil , and a series of rebellions flared up amongst the many poor , rural slaves .
Black slaves , who outnumbered whites by twenty - one , began uprisings and burned down plantations .
Until 1820 , male slaves could be whipped in the field , and both male and female slaves could be flogged as punishment .
Rebellions and further pressure from England caused slavery to be abolished in 1838 , but little change in the welfare of the people would be evident over the next hundred years , as Jamaica offered virtually no opportunities other than farm work .
For rural Jamaicans desperate to escape the limits of plantation existence , it meant going to the one big city on the island , where the white establishment ’s banks , ports , and shipping might provide better jobs and a better future .
But this was a false promise , and by the 1920s there was a teaming slum in Kingston built over a trench that took Kingston ’s white neighborhoods ’ sewage out to sea .
This slum was known as “ Trenchtown ” .
In this hot , poor ghetto where the English spoken is a patois – a dialect hardly recognizable to the English establishment – several streams of consciousness percolated amongst the weary children of slaves .
The poverty was worsened by the worldwide depression in 1930 that reduced world industrial demand for Jamaica ’s primary exports of sugar and bauxite ( used to make aluminum ) .
Marcus Garvey
Marcus Garvey was a Jamaican - born writer and newspaper journalist who worked ceaselessly for the improvement and liberation of the black people of the US and the Caribbean .
For 15 years , Garvey made a global reputation for himself as an activist for black people and , in August 1914 , he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association ( UNIA ) in Jamaica as a means of uniting all of Africa and its children dispersed around the world – largely due to white man ’s slave practices of previous centuries – into “ one grand racial hierarchy . ”
As the group ’s first President - General , Garvey ’s goal was “ to unite all people of African ancestry of the world to one great body to establish a country and absolute government of their own . ”
After corresponding with scholar and spokesperson Booker T. Washington , one of America ’s most influential black men of the first half of the 20th century , Garvey arrived in the US from England on March 23 , 1916 and visited with a number of Black leaders .
After moving to New York , he found work as a printer by day , speaking at night on street corners , much like he did in London ’s Hyde Park .
It was then that Garvey perceived a leadership vacuum among people of African ancestry .
On May 9 , 1916 , he held his first public lecture in New York City at St. Mark ’s Church - in - the - Bowery and undertook a 38 - state speaking tour .
Building a nationwide following throughout the United States in the First World War years ( 1916 - 1918 ) , Marcus Garvey saw his movement become the largest African - American organization the world had seen to that time .
On August 17 , 1918 , publication of the widely distributed Negro World newspaper began , with Garvey as an editor ( without pay until November 1920 ) .
By June 1919 , the membership of his organization had grown to over two million people .
On June 27 , 1919 , the members of the UNIA , with Garvey as President , incorporated the Black Star Line of Delaware , a shipping company organized specifically to take American blacks back to Africa for repatriation and operating as a black capitalist self - sufficient venture that shipped goods as well .
By September , they obtained their first ship .
Much fanfare surrounded the inspection of the S.S. Yarmouth and it ’s rechristening as the S.S. Frederick Douglass on September 14 , 1919 .
Garvey ’s rapid rise in the urban black communities of America drew notice from American authorities .
Racism in the United States was virulent through the US federal government and its police agencies .
In this period , US authorities and the new Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) were keeping an eye on various “ troublesome ” groups , including communists , trade unionists , radicals , eastern Europeans , Negroes smoking cannabis , Negro musicians , and Negro radicals .
Marcus Garvey survived assassination attempts and arrests , and his influence grew .
By August 1920 , the UNIA claimed four million members .
At the International Convention of the UNIA on August 1 , with delegates from all over the world in attendance , 25,000 people filled Madison Square Garden to hear Garvey speak .
Garvey rankled the existing black American leadership , especially William E. B. DuBois , who wrote , “ Marcus Garvey is , without doubt , the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and in the world .
He is either a lunatic or a traitor . ”
DuBois was a scholar and writer of many books , and is considered the father of Pan -Africanism .
Along with Booker T. Washington , he was one of the most influential black men in America of the first half of the 1900s .
DuBois ’ view of Garvey led to an acrimonious relationship between the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , co-founded by DuBois in 1910 , and Garvey ’s UNIA .
DuBois was editor of the NAACP magazine The Crisis , with circulation of over 100,000 copies in 1920 , while Garvey was an impatient firebrand demanding direct action with the weekly newspaper Negro World , which competed directly with The Crisis for the loyalty of the black urban American .
Garvey recognized the influence of the Ku Klux Klan and , in a wildly daring move in early 1922 , he went to Atlanta , Georgia for a conference with KKK imperial giant Edward Young Clarke .
The intention was to see if the KKK wanted to contribute money for the return of blacks to Africa on the Black Star Line .
On this policy of repatriation , Garvey and the white racist Klan ’s politics overlapped .
According to Garvey , “ I regard the Klan , the Anglo - Saxon clubs and White American societies , as far as the Negro is concerned , as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together .
I like honesty and fair play .
You may call me a Klansman if you will , but , potentially , every white man is a Klansman , as far as the Negro in competition with whites socially , economically and politically is concerned , and there is no use lying . ”
After Garvey ’s summit with the Ku Klux Klan , DuBois and other African American leaders wrote to US Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty to have Garvey incarcerated , and shortly afterward , Garvey was .
Sometime in November 1919 , the Bureau of Investigation ( BOI , the precursor to the FBI ) launched an investigation into the activities of Garvey and the UNIA .
Although initial efforts by the BOI were to find grounds upon which to deport Garvey as “ an undesirable alien ” , a charge of mail fraud was brought against him in connection with stock sales of the Black Star Line after the US Post Office and the Attorney General joined the investigation .
Of the four Black Star Line officers charged in connection with the enterprise , only Garvey was found guilty of using the mail service to defraud .
His supporters called the trial fraudulent : postal employees lied , while other prosecution witnesses clearly perjured themselves .
When the trial ended on June 23 , 1923 , Garvey had been sentenced to five years in prison .
He initially spent three months in the Tombs Jail ( Manhattan Detention Center ) awaiting approval of bail for his appeal .
After being released on bail , Garvey continued to maintain his innocence , travel , speak and organize the UNIA .
After numerous attempts at appeal were unsuccessful , he was taken into custody on February 8 , 1925 and began serving his sentence at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary .
Two days later , he penned his “ First Message to the Negroes of the World From Atlanta Prison ” and made a memorable proclamation : “ Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm , look for me all around you , for , with God ’s grace , I shall come and bring with me countless millions of black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you in the fight for Liberty , Freedom and Life . ”
Garvey would have a direct impact on some of the most influential black people of his century , including Malcolm X ’s parents , Earl and Louise Little , who met at a UNIA convention in Montreal , Canada .
( Earl was the president of the UNIA division in Omaha , Nebraska and sold the Negro World newspaper while Louise was a contributor to the same publication . )
During a trip to Jamaica , Martin Luther King and his wife Coretta Scott King visited the shrine of Marcus Garvey on June 20 , 1965 and laid a wreath .
In a speech , he told the audience that Garvey “ was the first man of color to lead and develop a mass movement .
He was the first man on a mass scale and level to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny .
And make the Negro feel he was somebody . ”
In November 1927 , President Calvin Coolidge commuted Marcus Garvey ’s sentence and , upon release , Garvey was immediately deported to Jamaica .
He received a hero ’s welcome in Kingston , and set about activating the UNIA office in a more aggressive way , publishing a new daily Jamaican newspaper called The Blackman , debuting in March 1929 .
In speeches around the island and in the newspaper , Garvey frequently spoke lines like , “ Look to Africa , when a black king shall be crowned , for the day of deliverance is at hand ! ”
Garvey also founded Jamaica ’s first political party in 1929 , The People ’s Political Party ( he was elected to the Jamaican legislature in 1930 and 1932 ) , and his message really took off among the farm workers and slum tenants when the worldwide depression caused more misery .
In 1930 , most Jamaicans called themselves Christian , and those Jamaicans attracted to Garvey ’s liberation message were largely Christian .
Although leery of the influence of religion , Garvey had founded the African Orthodox Church ten years earlier as an alternative to white churches ’ European - centric teachings .
Suddenly , in November 1930 , the world became aware that an African was to be crowned King of Ethiopia – then the only independent country in all Africa – and his name was Ras Tafari Makonnen ( ‘ Ras ’ meaning ‘ Chief ’ or ‘ Head ’ ) .
This previously little - known individual had ascended to the crown of Ethiopia after the death of Empress Zewditu ; his coronation attracted monarchs and heads of state from all over the world , and a lavish affair ( $ 3,000,000 in 1930 ! ) was shown around the world in newspapers , magazines and cinema newsreels .
This “ Ras Tafari ” was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie ( ‘ Power of the Trinity ’ ) I and , in Jamaica , some saw this as biblical prophecy come to pass .
As the ideas of Marcus Garvey spread among Jamaicans , and with the appearance of a black king in Africa , a new philosophy emerged in the rural parishes of eastern Jamaica in 1933 .
Garvey ’s message of African Unity and the coming of a black King from Africa were heard years before the next prophet of Rastafari , Leonard Howell , appeared on the scene .
Garvey was the prophet , and Howell was the disciple saying the prophecy had come true .
Leonard Howell
Leonard Percival Howell was born in Jamaica in 1898 , but left as a teenager to find work in the Americas .
It is known that Leonard Howell sought work and lived in Harlem from 1924 to 1930 .
In 1929 , Howell ran a “ teahouse ” where cannabis smoking and bhang beverages ( cannabis yogurt - like drinks ) were served .
At the time , New York City had over 400 marijuana teahouses – or “ viper dens ” , “ tea jukes ” , and “ tea pads ” as they were variously called – before marijuana prohibition began in 1937 .
However , the UNIA building , where Garvey ’s group had rented Howell space , was alarmed at this reefer den and decided to ostracize Howell , ejecting him from UNIA and his teahouse in 1930 .
Deported from the US in 1932 , Howell returned to Jamaica a man on a mission .
Virtually unknown , Howell started preaching a never before heard doctrine : “ Ras Tafari as messiah returned to earth ” .
In all his speeches ( delivered with no success in Kingston but enthusiastically received in the rural parishes ) , he began to lay down a philosophy that heralded a black liberation movement inspired by the Bible , Marcus Garvey and the struggle of the black people – a spiritually uplifting code of behavior and belief under the divine inspiration of Ras Tafari Makonnen , Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia .
In less than one year of going from village to village in the eastern parts of Jamaica , Howell had become a passionate and influential speaker .
His extreme message found favor with the very poor peasants who made up the vast majority of Jamaica ’s people , but the remarks were shocking to the white aristocracy and educated Christian black communities .
To them , Howell was advocating sacrilege , mutiny and violent overthrow .
Howell was arrested on December 16 , 1933 for urging treason and sedition .
At his March 13 - 16 , 1934 trial at Morant Bay , in St. Thomas parish on the eastern tip of the island – the scene of hundreds of years of slave disembarkation – Howell laid out his Ras Tafari philosophy .
Essentially , Howell was saying the Black peoples ’ problem of oppression and racist structures had to be replaced by black peoples ’ culture .
In his speech , Howell laid out six points he repeated in all his speeches – points that , in 1934 , were the first documented tenets of Rastafari : “ hatred for the white race ; the superiority of the black race ; revenge on the whites for their wickedness ; the negation , persecution and humiliation of the government and legal bodies of Jamaica ; preparation for return to Africa ; and acknowledgement of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as Supreme Being and only ruler of the black people . ”
The Chief Justice called Howell ’s “ Ras Tafari ” beliefs “ a devil doctrine ” .
The government ’s prosecution against Howell was based on two points : Howell had called Queen Victoria ‘ The Harlot Queen ’ and told British subjects they were in fact Ethiopians .
The actual ‘ sedition ’ was committed in court again when Howell said during his defense , “ Ras Tafari as Messiah has returned to Earth , ” and told the court “ the king of England is not my king , not my sovereign … Emperor Haile Selassie I , King of Africa , is my sovereign ” .
Howell was convicted of sedition and sentenced to two years in jail .
Prior to his arrest , Howell had been speaking to the downtrodden and anyone who would listen for nine months solid .
One of the phrases that Howell used to describe the conditions of Jamaican blacks after the end of colonial slavery in 1838 was “ this dreadful freedom ” that must be transformed from “ a meaningless existence ” to one of self - aware black pride and empowerment .
Listening to Howell were mostly young male field workers , laboring under intense sun and humidity .
Many of them smoked ganja , as it was called , day and night .
The cannabis was brought to Jamaica by Indian merchants in 1882 , and found fertile growing conditions on the island where it was used in alcohol tinctures , salves , and oils .
It was around 1919 when ganja was smoked – usually by young plantation workers – as it kept them musical and cool in the heat .
The ganja also directed their thoughts to social injustice ; indeed , there were to be uprisings in 1935 to 1938 in parishes where Howell had preached and ganja was smoked .
While in jail , Howell wrote extensively and continued to outline his philosophy , and put it in a document called The Promised Key .
The black laborers saw Howell as a visionary , courageous , perhaps too radical , but his philosophy of this “ Dread Freedom ” and the reign of “ Ras Tafari ” continued to grow during his incarceration .
Released in 1936 , he continued to speak , and frustration was building in Jamaica .
Tens of thousands of Jamaicans were migrating home after working abroad ( between 1880 and 1912 , some 146,000 Jamaicans went abroad to seek employment ; Howell and Marcus Garvey among them , both leaving as teenagers ) .
The worldwide economic collapse accelerated the impoverished conditions Howell saw in 1933 .
Riots , looting , burning and protests started in 1936 and by 1938 there was an uprising , a combination general strike and riots in eastern Jamaica .
Within ten years of Garvey ’s return and five years of Howell ’s advocacy , Jamaicans were using pressure to get the white aristocracy to give way .
But it was more than about poverty ; it was about the long - term theft of their land .
In 1838 , the ex-slaves sought to transform themselves into an independent community of small farmers .
To this end , they bought small plots from anyone willing to sell , rented where they could , or simply squatted on unused land .
The growth of an independent peasantry , however , was contrary to the interests of the big landowners who required a cheap supply of labor .
In 1867 , Jamaican Governor Sir John Peter Grant set up a Lands Department to repossess the land from the squatters .
By 1912 , over 240,000 acres had been returned to the Crown .
This is why so many Jamaicans emigrated in that period – the disappearance of private ownership of the land by the black population left peasant farming and poverty as the likeliest future in Jamaica .
It was only a matter of time before the displaced peasantry became a formidable army of unemployed and underemployed for whom stealing food and sustenance became the main option for survival .
Jamaica ’s white community added thousands of policemen , mostly in rural areas , and this pushed young black men to seek refuge in the slums of Kingston , the port city , and administrative and business capital of the island .
The size of Kingston tripled in population from 1885 ( 34,000 ) to 1935 ( 115,000 ) , mostly in slums for the displaced farmers .
( Kingston now has 520,000 of Jamaica ’s two million people in 2008 . )
The slums of Kingston were described by Marcus Garvey in his newspaper The Black Man .
“ In what is called the Spanish Town Road area in Jamaica , there are more people living in the most primitive and unfortunate state than can be found in any recognized part of the world .
The people who live there outnumber who live in other sections of the city , yet the Governor never goes there nor legislators nor anybody of importance .
The people indulge in Pocomania ( voodoo ) and in the practices of the most ruthless and horrible barbarities . ”
This was his final stay in Jamaica , and his criticisms of Jamaica were now met by ingratitude and hostility from Kingston teenagers , who , in a resounding humiliation , threw stones and insults at him on the streets .
In the 1936 to 1938 period , the angry youths of Trenchtown and Tivoli Gardens felt Garvey was too polite and too much a representative from the genteel past .
Crestfallen and disappointed , Garvey left for England and died in 1940 in poverty .
Nonetheless , Garvey was the most important black philosopher to the development of Martin Luther King , Jr. , Malcolm X and Bob Marley .
In the 1938 uprisings , Leonard Howell tried to return to St. Thomas but was literally turned away by a violent mob of plantation agents , politicians , black trade unionist leaders and police .
Howell ’s rival for the political affections of ordinary Jamaicans was William Alexander Bustamante , a union organizer in 1939 , Jamaica ’s first minister in the legislature in 1944 and , by 1962 , Jamaica ’s first post - independence Prime Minister .
Bustamante is a national hero of Jamaica and never relented in his views of Rastafari , persecuting them from 1940 to 1966 .
Bustamante wrote to the Governor the following July 6 , 1939 letter : “ Serious trouble is brewing at Port Morant , in St. Thomas , owing to a mischievousness of a man named Howell , leader of this terrible thing called ‘ Rastafari ’ .
It seems to me the only right and proper place for this man is in the asylum .
He is a danger to the peace of the community .
I think he is the greatest danger that exists in the country today , and I believe the police can confirm . ”
The uprisings ended that year with universal voting granted for all Jamaicans – perhaps the political price for allying to England in the Second
World War .
In 1940 , Leonard Howell set up a communal Rastafarian endeavor , “ Pinnacle ” , on an old 500 - acre estate near Spanish Town in Sligoville of St. Catherine parish , outside of Kingston .
Pinnacle was only accessible by foot and hidden from the rest of the world .
It was n’t his first commune – that was Tabernacle , in 1939 – but Pinnacle propelled Rastafarian belief into international news , as it was the first successful commune of its kind .
Though Howell had in 1933 rejected certain aspects of Christianity , by 1940 the Old Testament was being combed for references that pointed to the righteousness of the Rastafari lifestyle and philosophy .
Pinnacle maintained 600 to 1,600 residents working several orchards and farms , and was immediately self - sufficient .
Howell interpreted the Bible to say a man could have multiple wives , and indeed , Howell had 13 wives within a few years at Pinnacle , siring ten children .
( Prophet Bob Marley would later father 13 children through nine women . )
Pinnacle was also farming large crops of ganja , as this magical ‘ herb ’ was required use for all residents at Pinnacle , as proscribed in Genesis 1:29 , “ And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good ” .
( Grass , Herb , Kind , are all common vernacular words for cannabis today that come from the Bible story of Genesis 1:29 and its association with Ras Tafari . )
Additionally , it was sold to youth and true believers throughout the island .
When Howell formed Pinnacle , there were no laws against ganja ; smoking it was said to bring a connection with the holy and divine , and attract reason and calmness .
The herb was regarded as “ wisdom weed ” , and the Rasta leaders urged that it be smoked as a religious rite , alleging that it was found growing on the grave of King Solomon and citing Biblical passages , such as Psalms 104:14 , to attest to its sacramental properties :
“ He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man , that he may bring forth food out of the Earth . ”
In 1935 , Italy had invaded Ethiopia , the only independent country at that time in Africa .
Although Haile Selassie
I and his soldiers put up a brave resistance , their tribesmen and primitive weapons were no match for the modern war machine .
Seeing their divine sovereign under attack , young Rastafari men joined the ‘ Nyabinghi , ’ a movement led by their Emperor .
The original Nyabinghi was a warrior Princess from what is now Rwanda , who died fighting the Italians .
Some Rasta began to call themselves Nyabinghi or ‘ Nya - men , ’ while Rasta meetings of solidarity were also called Nyabingi .
The purpose of Nyabinghi was the overthrow of white domination by racial war .
Howell had already struck this violent note in his six original tenets of Rastafari , and Nyabingi was defined in Jamaica as “ death to black and white oppressors ” .
These Nyabingi gatherings incorporated the earliest structured Rasta behaviors for their women , including : Rasta ‘ queens ’ could not cook if menstruating , ‘ reason ’ with the ‘ kingmen ’ nor partake of the ‘ chalice ’ ( a pipe to smoke marijuana ) .
Biblical support was found for limiting Rasta women ’s access to knowledge other than through the guidance of their ‘ kingmen ’ .
The Old Testament would also increasingly be used to foretell the divine path of Ras Tafari .
The pulse of Pinnacle was the Nyabinghi ‘ grounation ’ sessions that sometimes lasted days .
Rastas beat funde , kete and repeater drums in round - the - clock relays , chanting down Babylon by firelight and daylight .
This relentless drumming and chanting led to trancelike states of higher consciousness , fuelled by giant chalices full of cannabis .
Within a year , the Pinnacle was successful and perhaps the largest communal experiment ever on the island .
The Rasta message of black pride , cannabis use , and defiance in the face of another world war brought on by the white man ’s military ambitions was popular and represented a very large potential political problem .
It is in this period that Howell was affectionately nicknamed “ Gong ” ( “ The Tough One ” or “ The One ” ) and is known today as “ First Gong ” .
( Bob Marley is called “ Tuff Gong ” and son Damien Marley is “ Junior Gong ” . )
Authorities watched Howell with suspicion .
In 1941 , more than a year after opening Pinnacle , Howell was arrested in a violent police raid for cultivating marijuana alongside yams on the Pinnacle farms .
Jamaican authorities , including Alexander Bustamante , the black and white clergy , and the white establishment regarded the Rastafari – and Howell particularly – as dangerous .
All Howell ’s enemies agreed that marijuana should be criminalized as a means to dislodge him from Pinnacle .
Thus , just prior to the raid on Pinnacle , the Jamaican government outlawed marijuana in the “ Dangerous Drugs Law ” , mandating jail for anyone possessing , selling , growing or smoking ganja .
Seventy residents of Pinnacle were arrested and 28 jailed under the new law ;
Howell himself sentenced to two more years in jail .
Released from prison in 1943 , Howell developed a corps of guardsman , some of whom grew their hair long and were known as “ Ethiopian warriors ” or “ locksmen ” ( these may have been the first Rastafari who used a form of dreadlocks as a sign of divine strength ) .
No photographs of these locksmen can be found , and the first appearance of Rasta dreadlocks is debated ; claims exist from 1936 ( when historian Louis Moyston attributes the emergence of the dreadlocks to the time when Ethiopia was invaded by Italy , based on images of Kikuyu fighters who fought with Haile Selassie against the Italians ) , to 1944 ( the appearance of Howell ’s locksmen ) , to 1947 ( the first recorded reference to dreadlocks in The Daily Gleaner , Jamaica ’s main newspaper for over a century ) , 1949 ( when the dreadlocked Youth Black Faith gang was first noted in the press ) , and 1953 ( when images appeared in newsreels and other publications of the feared Mau Mau independence insurgents in Kenya who grew their “ dreaded locks ” while hiding in the mountains ) .
The first historical example of dreadlocks prior to Ras Tafari are Hindu sadhus who today and for millennia have let their hair mat and become dreadlocked .
The readings of Hindu mystics influenced Howell in the 1938 to 1940 period and Hindu influences show up in Rastafari culture today because of Howell ’s experience .
Just as words like “ grass ” , “ herb ” and “ kind ” from the Bible are used by Rastas to describe cannabis , so too does the word “ baldhead ” emerge from Leviticus 21:5 – unbelievers referred to as baldheads were usually civil servants , police , government authorities with clean - shaven faces and short , tightly cropped hair .
In order to succeed in Jamaica ’s white elite culture , Jamaican males would keep their hair close - cropped ( baldhead ) so Rastas did the opposite , growing dreadlocks – though dreadlocks were still rare until the late 1950s – because they brought alarm and ostracization from regular Jamaican society , so fearsome and menacing was the “ dread ” style .
Leonard Howell reformed Pinnacle in 1943 and with each raid , arrest and seizure of ganja crops became more extreme and militant in his exhortations .
The militant , defiant dreadlock look dominated Rastafari culture by 1960 , although Howell always had short - cropped hair and beard .
As Christians , Rasta beard modifications were required by the Nazirite vow in Numbers 6:5 which reads , “ All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow ” , and Leviticus 21:5 , “ They shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cutting of their flesh . ”
This last admonition had dire consequences for Marley ; when he was diagnosed with cancer of the toe in 1977 and doctors recommended amputation , Marley declined to have the toe removed – because no Rasta shall “ make any cutting of the flesh ” – and the cancer moved from his toe to his brain , killing him in 1981 .
Although Rastafari is in fact a fundamentalist Christian religion , by the mid 1950s , Leonard Howell , Rastafari and Pinnacle had become a regular government target .
First Minister Bustamante , in his anti-communist drive of 1954 , invaded Pinnacle , arresting 163 “ dreads ” .
The remaining Rastafari community thought Howell was becoming mentally unbalanced , egomaniacal , and was plainly a heat score , so the remaining members of the commune voted to exclude him from Pinnacle .
The Rasta commune continued on without Howell , but government finally invaded in 1958 , burning every dwelling to the ground and looting the entire place .
All belongings were destroyed , including notebooks , ganja , and personal possessions .
Jamaican police deliberately destroyed all of Leonard Howell ’s 30 years of diaries , writings , photographs , memoirs , and letters from around the world , which were in the library at Pinnacle .
The Jamaican government , by now under black rule , wanted no historical record of the Rastafari movement .
Indeed , only a few photographs and writings of Howell exist today .
After razing Pinnacle to ashes , Police took every one of the over 1,000 residents and dropped them off near Trenchtown – the biggest slum in all of Jamaica .
These discarded Rastas joined a percolating milieu of the poor , angry , dispossessed people who lived in continual violence and poverty .
Yet from this teeming shantytown a vibrant musical culture emerged around 1958 .
Bob Marley
Nesta Robert Marley , originally from Nine Miles , a serene dot on the north coast of Jamaica , moved to Kingston in 1958 at the age of 13 .
Nesta , as his mother called him – Robbie to all others – was born of a 50 - year - old white naval officer named Norval Marley and 18 - year - old Cedella Booker .
Like many before them , Nesta Marley and his mother Cedella eventually settled in Trenchtown .
His friends were other street youths who were frustrated and riled up with their place in Jamaican society ; one friend in particular with whom Robbie first developed his interest in music was Neville O’Riley Livingston , known as Bunny .
Over the next five years , Robbie worked odd jobs as a welder and mechanic , but played music in all his free time .
Robbie was a “ Rude Boy ” , the name for the urban gang members of Trenchtown and other slums .
This was a violent , dead - end neighborhood without water or sewage , infested with angry young men in a hot , humid climate .
A street fighter continually running from police , and even sending toughs to beat - up or threaten DJs who would n’t play his music , Robbie had adopted the street nickname “ Tuff Gong ” – meaning Tough One – which endures to this day as the record label for all the Marley family members .
“ Everyday I jumped fences from the police for years , not weeks , for years , ” he said of his youth in Trenchtown .
“ You either stay there and let bad people shoot you down , or you make a move and show people some improvement . ”
In 1963 , a Rastafarian hand drummer named Alvin Patterson became his mentor , and immediately guided Robbie ’s music in a streetwise direction .
The first song Robbie wrote and performed under Patterson ’s tutelage , “ Simmer Down ” , was released in December 1963 with Bunny Livingston and Peter Tosh as the Wailing Wailers .
Peter Tosh explained the name came from “ a cry or moan of despair that was life in Trenchtown ” ; the band changed their name a few times before the decided on simply the Wailers .
“ Simmer Down ” was the song of a changed Robbie , and Alvin Patterson ’s Rasta influence is noticeable , as the song was a call to stop the violence among the Rude Boys .
Simmer down , oh control your temper
Simmer down , for the battle will be hotter
Simmer down , and you wo n’t get no supper
Simmer down , and you know you bound to suffer
Simmer down , simmer , simmer , simmer right down
In 1963 , Robbie had short , cropped hair and was not religious , although he was born Christian .
“ Simmer Down ” went to # 1 on the Jamaican charts for eight weeks .
It was music of the streets , a reality check that clicked with Jamaican youth and sold 77,000 copies .
The style of music played by the Wailers was called “ ska ” or “ rocksteady ” ; the word “ reggae ” would not come into style or use until 1968 .
While the Wailers performed regularly , they did not progress much further .
Two years after the Wailers ’ big hit , Robbie ’s mother Cedella remarried and moved to Delaware .
She bought her son a plane ticket so he could join her and seek employment in the US , starting a new life .
When Cedella went to get her son ’s passport for the impending visit to America , the registrar at the Passport Office took umbrage at the name Nesta .
“ What kind of name is that ?
Is it a girl name ?
People think he a girl .
Dem will laugh at him . ”
But the clerk found favor with the middle name : “ Robert !
Now see !
Dere ’s a good name for a man , Bob !
Solid like a rock – like de name of a man should be .
None of this Nesta , Lesta , Chester foolishness .
I ’m going to put down his name on the passport as Robert Nesta Marley . ”
From this time forward , Nesta Robbie Marley was officially Bob Marley .
Before moving to the US , Bob had met a young girl named Rita Anderson and married her on February 10 , 1966 .
He moved to Delaware the following March to earn money for his next musical project and to re-unite with his mother .
At this time , Bob was not a Rastafarian .
He was working odd jobs in Delaware when Haile Selassie I came to Jamaica in April 21 of that year .
More than 100,000 believers came from all over Jamaica to greet “ The Emperor of Ethiopia ” , “ The Lion of Judah ” at the airport and line the streets of his motorcade procession .
Upon arrival at the Norman Manley Airport , he began to exit the plane but retreated when he saw huge billowing clouds of ganja smoke and thousands of Rastafarians chanting “ Jah Rastafari ” .
Some were carrying signs such as “ Selassie is Christ ” , “ King of Kings ” and “ God Anointed ” .
He refused to leave the plane until his security was assured , even though only 15,000 of the multitude were dreaded Rastafarians , but they were the most enthusiastic and vocal , puffing enormous cannabis spliffs .
Only when the smoke abated did His Imperial Majesty leave the plane .
Rita Anderson
Marley went to see his arrival , but traffic was snarled around Kingston and she could not get close .
Selassie ’s motorcade left the airport only to pass right by Rita ’s car and , in that brief moment , Selassie waved at her .
She had an immediate powerful spiritual experience that confirmed in her mind the righteousness of King Selassie .
Rita talked excitedly in correspondence with her husband about her new passion .
Bob , a skeptic about religion until now , took her seriously .
While in Delaware , he had a dream where a father - like figure in a felt hat and coat put a ring on his finger .
It was a story Bob told his mother immediately , and Rita by letter .
Later , in 1968 , he would say that it was Haile Selassie , his father incarnate , who gave him the ring in the dream ; in 1978 the grandson of Haile Selassie – who died in 1975 – gave Bob a black ring with a gold lion that had been worn by his Imperial Majesty .
( Bob Marley still wears the ring today in his burial place . )
In those ten years , Bob Marley went from local musician to the world ’s foremost musical ambassador for peace and justice .
Upon his return to Jamaica in October 1966 , Bob came under the tutelage of respected Rastafari Mortimer Planno .
Little known is that Bob and Peter Tosh wrote more than eighty tracks from 1968 to 1972 for Cayman Music , a company run by Danny Sims , earning $ 50 a week .
Sims had met the two Wailers while acting as manager for singer Johnny Nash ( famous for the 1968 hit song “ I Can See Clearly Now ” ) and said , “ There was no ‘ Jah ’ in the music Bob was making back then .
It was all ‘ Jesus this ’ and ‘ the Lord ’ that . ”
Bob ’s own music in the 1968 to 1972 period , however , was developing a consciousness that reflected his increasing self - education ; he voraciously read Rasta texts and the works of Marcus Garvey , Leonard Howell , Martin Luther King , Jr. and Malcolm X when he was n’t writing music for himself , the Wailers , and Cayman Music .
It was in these four years that Bob became a true believer , growing dreadlocks in 1970 .
“ Marcus Garvey was prophet , ” Bob said in an interview about his conversion .
“ Marcus Garvey tell everyone we must look east to the king .
Everything Marcus Garvey has said has come to pass .
Everyone see it .
Everything he said in that time happen today .
And everyone see it happening . ”
He “ pledged to work for righteousness .
God ’s given me inspiration .
God is the boss , he tell you what to do .
You must understand , God is ever living and Haile Selassie is God .
God is not everybody .
Some people say ‘ I ’m a man , you ’re a man ’ and they look upon man and say ‘ that man God ’ .
It ’s not like that .
A man have to prove himself to be God , Haile Selassie is God . ”
All his music from this point forth bore a serious spiritual message based on Rastafari and universal struggle against oppression .
Bob now believed his music could be used as a message of freedom , hope and peace for the impoverished and oppressed .
From 1970 to 1981 , Bob Marley became the world ’s best - known advocate of Rastafari with over 170 of his songs integrating elements of Rasta philosophy .
While Bob was writing music in 1969 , the first hit “ reggae ” song appeared , “ Return of Django ” by Carlton and Ashton Barrett in a band called The Upsetters .
Bob loved this new sound and enthusiastically embraced it as his own .
He got Carlton and Ashton to join the Wailers on their return from an Upsetters tour of England .
This was the truly seminal Wailers : Bob Marley , Peter Tosh , Bunny Wailer , and Ashton and Carleton Barrett .
In early 1970 , their first reggae hits “ Duppy Conqueror ” ( Duppy means spirit ) , “ Who The Cap Fit ” , “ 400 Years ” , and “ Soul Rebel ” were written .
The 1973 release of the great and historic album “ Catch a Fire ” by the Wailers made them known worldwide and , when Eric Clapton and others began recording Marley ’s songs , his fame spread fast .
The Wailers and Bob Marley & The Wailers put out ten albums from “ Catch A Fire ” to the final album “ Confrontation ” ( released posthumously ) , with cumulative sales of 320,000,000 worldwide .
The 1977 release “ Exodus ” was deemed the greatest album of the century in Time Magazine ’s Top 100 albums of the century .
No other single man in modern times has advanced a religious faith to hundreds of millions in the space of three decades .
Although it has only about one million adherents , Rastafari and its inextricable relationship with cannabis are recognized everywhere on earth , and there are Rastafarian communities on every continent .
Bob Marley was not the only outstanding reggae musician from Jamaica , but he popularized the genre for the world and , in the golden age from 1970 to 1980 , gave a green light to some of the best reggae music ever ( Jimmy Cliff , Toots & The Maytals , Sly & Robbie , etc. ) , to get Jamaica onto the world stage .
Bob was unabashed in his endorsement of cannabis , variously referring to it as “ the healing of the nations ” , “ the tree of life ” , “ spliff ” , “ ganja ” , “ herb ” , and “ kaya ” ( also an album title ) .
“ Like how alcohol is the destruction of mankind , herb is the healing of the nations , ” he once said .
He admitted to a BBC interviewer that he smoked one pound of herb each week , and was not ashamed to be photographed or filmed with a big spliff .
The song “ I Shot the Sheriff ” , made popular by Eric Clapton but written and performed by Bob on the “ Burnin ” album , is all about a pot grower hunted down by a relentless sheriff .
Sheriff John Brown always hate me ,
for what , I do n’t know .
Every time I plant a seed ,
he said , kill it before it grow .
He said , kill them before they grow .
Bob knew well that people who smoked herb were persecuted by Babylon , the ruling system : “ Them crucify Christ , remember ? ” Condemning cannabis was blasphemy : “ You mean they can tell God that it ’s not legal ? ” he queried a Canadian journalist – by extension that made God a criminal too , he reasoned .
Bob spoke at length about cannabis in a New Zealand television interview in 1979 , “ The more you accept herb , the more you accept Rastafari .
Herb is important to those who accept it , but it is more important to the people who do not accept it yet , because herb is a reality .
Herb is not something you create , herb is a plant .
Herb ’s so good for everything .
Why these people who want to do so much good for everyone , who call themselves government and this and that , why them say you must not smoke herb ?
They say you must not use it because it make you rebel .
Against what ?
Against the men who want to create desire and want these material things , and captivate your mind , they promise you a pension and them keep it all .
Instead of wanting to work for the Man then you want to be the Man .
Herb make you look at yourself .
You not want to bow to these things …
When the world confuse you and you ’re worried , and you do n’t have time to think , herb is the thing that gives you a little time for yourself , so you can live . ”
As to cannabis being outlawed around the world , Bob said , “ I do n’t care .
The people who make it outlawed are but a few ; the majority of people who are hurt want it .
A few men with guns , prisons , make a bad life for us .
They do n’t want people power , they do n’t want Rastafari . ”
Bob Marley is certainly the prophet of the cannabis culture , and a prophet of Rastafari with Marcus Garvey and Leonard Howell .
His funeral in May 1981 , just three months after Howell ’s , saw Marley buried with his guitar , soccer ball , and a fat branch of marijuana .
“ I see myself as a revolutionary .
Rasta is the future . ”
Bob Marley , 1979
Biblical Prophecy of the Arrival of Haile Selassie I as Living God
Essential to Rastafari is that Ras ( meaning head , Duke , Chief ) Tafari Makonnen , who was crowned Haile Selassie I , Emperor of Ethiopia , on November 2 , 1930 , is the living God incarnate .
Called Jah , he is the black Messiah who will lead all those of righteous livity ( wholesome natural lifestyle ) into a promised land of full emancipation and divine justice called Zion ( a new Earth , Isaiah 65:17 ) .
Selassie I also had the titles King of Kings , Elect of God and Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah .
These titles are a close match for those of the Messiah mentioned in Revelation 5:5 ( which verse reads “ Lord of Lords ” rather than “ Elect of God ” . )
Psalm 87:4- 6 is also interpreted as predicting the coronation of Haile Selassie I. King David , ruler of Israel ( 1004 - 965 BC ) , and his son Solomon the Wise ( 965-930 BC ) are said to be direct descendents of Haile Selassie .
The Kingdom of Judea ( Israel ) was crushed by the Assyrians in 722 BC and its people carried off into exile and death .
Over a hundred years later , Babylonia conquered the Kingdom of Judea , exiling its inhabitants and destroying Jerusalem .
The Solomonic Dynasty of Ethiopia was founded by Menelik I , the son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba , who had visited Solomon in Israel .
1 Kings 10:13 claims
“ And King Solomon gave unto the Queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty .
So she turned and went to her own country , she and her servants . ”
On the basis of the Ethiopian national epic , the Kebra Nagast , Rastas interpret this verse as meaning she conceived his child , and from this , conclude that African people are among the true children of Israel , or Jews .
Black Jews have lived in Ethiopia for centuries , disconnected from the rest of Judaism ; their existence gave some credence and impetus to early Rastafari , validating their belief that Ethiopia was Zion .
Rastas believe that they , and the rest of the black race , are descendants of the ancient twelve tribes of Israel , cast into captivity outside Africa as a result of the slave trade .
Bob Marley included Haile Selassie in many songs , including “ War ” from Rastaman Vibration , which paraphrases Selassie ’s speech to the United Nations in 1963 : “ Until the philosophy that holds one man superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned , everywhere is war . ”
Most Rastafari believe that Selassie is in some way a reincarnation of Jesus and that the Rastafari are the true Israelites .
At the heart of Rastafari is the belief in being one ’s own “ kingman ” or “ chief ” , saying they have been conditioned into slavery , but convert this into a belief in their own divine potential , believing that as Selassie I dwells within them , they also are worthy kings and princes .
Many Rastas study the book Kebra Nagast , a sacred text over 1,000 years old , which mixes Jesus Christ with the Old Testament .
Based on the prophecies in this book , Rastas determine that Selassie is the 225th regal descendent of Sheba and Solomon , thus a direct relative of Jesus of Nazareth .
Rastas are satisfied that Selassie ’s bloodline was entirely African and many Biblical persons would have been black , giving the Bible more power to these oppressed African descendents .
In this realization , the Bible is much less Eurocentric .
Ethiopian culture was perhaps the only African place not influenced by Europeans .
Only after Selassie ’s death in 1975 , did Ethiopia adopt the western Gregorian calendar .
Rastas call Selassie “ Jah ” , or “ Jah Rastafari ” , and believe there is great power in these names ; he is also referred to as H.I.M. ( pronounced “ him ” ) , for His Imperial Majesty .
They call themselves Rastafari to express the personal relationship each Rasta has with Selassie I. Rastas like to use the ordinal with the name Haile Selassie I , deliberately pronouncing the Roman numeral for “ one ” – signifying “ the First ” – like the letter I ( “ eye ” ) as a means of expressing a personal relationship with God.
Haile Selassie I reigned Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974 .
In 1936 , TIME Magazine named him “ Man of the Year ” for his brave defense of Ethiopia against the 1935 Mussolini - led Italian fascist invasion .
Homosexuality and Women
Rastafari are very conservative in their view of homosexuality , it is condemned largely based on Old Testament edicts .
In the summer of 2007 , in the Toronto , Ontario area , five Jamaican dancehall musicians , including Buju Banton , had their shows cancelled for virulently anti-homosexual lyrics that called for the murder or eradication of “ queers ” .
Bob Marley was far more benevolent towards homosexuality ; he had no cause to disdain them , but they could not be Rastafari .
But in 2006 , “ Jamaica is the worst any of us has ever seen , ” says Rebecca Schleifer of US - based Human Rights Watch , and author of a scathing report on the island ’s anti-gay hostility .
Buju Banton , who is one of the nation ’s most popular dance - hall singers , grew up the youngest of 15 children in Kingston ’s Salt Lane , a slum dominated by ultraconservative Christian churches and intensely anti-gay Rastafarians .
Banton ’s his first hit , 1992 ’s “ Boom Bye - Bye ” , boasts of shooting gays with Uzis and burning their skin with acid “ like an old tire wheel . ”
The singer Elephant Man declares in one song , “ When you hear a lesbian getting raped , it ’s not our fault …
Two women in bed , that ’s two Sodomites who should be dead . ”
Another , Bounty Killer , urges listeners to burn “ Mister Faggoty ” and make him “ wince in agony . ”
Reggae ’s anti-gay rhetoric has seeped into the country ’s politics .
Jamaica ’s major political parties have passed some of the world ’s most punitive anti-sodomy laws and regularly incorporate homophobic music in their election campaigns .
Biblical proclamations on homosexuality , such as Leviticus 18:22 “ Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination ” are commands to the Rasta .
Rastafari believe that homosexuality is a product of Babylon ( the corrupt modern world ) and will not be found in Zion , the Promised Land of black justice .
Jamaica has more churches per capita than anywhere else on earth , most of them preaching a fundamentalist Christianity .
Jamaican Rastafari believe in racial segregation and an ultra- orthodox fire - and - brimstone reading of the Old Testament .
The hard - line Bobo Shanti have an even stricter interpretation of the Old Testament .
Not all Rastafari are homophobic , but TIME Magazine referred to Jamaica as “ the most homophobic place on Earth ” because of the dozens of murders and hundreds of attacks on gays on the island each year .
The Rasta view of a woman ’s place in the world is also extremely conservative .
The women in Rastafari are normally referred to as Queens .
Many Rastafarian marriages are informal ( common law ) and this explains the rather loose paternity obligations of some Rasta men .
A woman ’s role is housekeeping , childrearing and pleasing her King .
A Rastafarian Queen must reject “ Babylonial ” society , or Western culture .
Rastafari women cannot use make up , they cannot dress in short skirts and they cannot use chemicals in their hair .
Many Rastafarian women cannot use any form of birth control , as it is not natural and also seen as a Euro- centric way to control the African population , and abortion is also not an option , as it is seen as murder .
Rastafarian women are expected to know their place and nurture the community .
On Acceptance of White People as Rastas
The exclusionary nature of Rastafari is understandable .
In its origins , it was a black liberation and empowerment movement to throw off white colonial dominance , and a rejection of the white European - based world order .
It was not however , a rejection of the white man ’s interpretation of the Bible , as Rastafari adopts virtually all the white Orthodox Church ’s Biblical canon .
The Holy Piby , known as the Black Man ’s Bible , is principally about the destruction of white “ Babylonia ” and the return of the black Israelites to Africa .
In all the Rastafarian culture before Bob Marley in the 1970s , there were no white Rastas , nor were Rastas allowed to have sex with or marry whites .
Today this taboo has fallen with many Rasta men marrying white visitors to Jamaica , although one might cynically attribute this to opportunism ( i.e. a visa out of Jamaica ) .
Until Bob Marley ’s music spread around the world , a white Rasta would be inconceivable , but Marley ’s dominant international message was one of black justice , black direction , peace for all peoples , and love – love of self , love of the world , love for God .
There is little rancor to the white race in Bob Marley ’s powerful and enduring musical messages .
Marley made Rasta fashionable and comprehensible to hundreds of millions of people worldwide , including a post - colonial , post civil - rights generation of young white people .
Dietary Requirements
The most observant Rastas follow a dietary law called Ital ( from the word ‘ vital ’ ) .
Ital food is completely natural , not canned , free of chemicals and preservatives and eaten as raw as possible .
Old Testament prohibitions against pork and shellfish are part of Ital ; most Rastafarians are vegetarians or vegans .
Coffee and milk are also rejected as unnatural , and Rastafarians condemn the use of alcohol , since it is a fermented chemical that does not belong in the temple of the body , and it makes a person stupid , thereby playing into the hands of white leaders .
This is contrasted with the holy herb of marijuana , which is natural and believed by Rastas to open their mind and assist in reasoning .
Rasta Language
Rastas developed the King ’s Iyaric , a language with nuanced differences from British English , which is regarded as ‘ Babylon ’ culture .
Rastas speak a patois , an African rhythm incorporating English language , and is difficult for the white ear to readily distinguish .
“ I ” replaces me , you , mine , ours , and us .
Rastas affirm “ I and I ” , leaving no separation in the identity of things .
“ Me ” is felt to turn the person into an object , whereas “ I ” is about the individual .
“ I ” also shows a personal relationship to God .
“ I and I ” is , according to Rastafarian scholar E. E. Cashmore , “ an expression to totalize the concept of oneness , the oneness of two persons .
So God is within all of us and we ’re one people , in fact . ”
The term is often used in place of ‘ you and I ’ or ‘ we ’ among Rastafarians , implying that both persons are united under the love of Jah .
Livity is a life that is natural and earth loving .
Babylon is the corrupt world of materialism , white man ’s rule , the system .
Zion is the perfect world of balance , individual rights and dignity .
Irie means positive emotions and peaceful vibrations .
Irator replaces “ creator ” .
Idren or Bredren and Sistren refer to the oneness of Rastafarians and are used to describe one ’s peers ( male “ bredren ” , female “ sistren ” ) .
The dreadlocks Rastas wear are related to the fear of the Lord , as well as the fear locksmen inspired in the early stages of the movement .
Polytricks is a Rasta term replacing English “ politics ” , because so many politicians , etc. turn out , they say , to be more like tricksters .
Red literally means stoned , or under the influence of cannabis due to reddening of the eyes being a side effect of being under the influence .
Downpression replaces “ oppression ” , because oppression holds man down instead of keeping him up ( pronounced “ op ” in Jamaican patois . )
Similarly “ downgression ” equals “ violence ” ( from aggression ) .
Overstanding ( also “ innerstanding ” ) replaces “ understanding ” , referring to enlightenment that raises one ’s consciousness .
Do you have a linux server without a keyboard or monitor ?
Need to administer the server on - site but do n't want to lug over a monitor and keyboard ( or kvm ) ?
Then setup the server to output the console to a serial port and use screen / minicom ( Hyperterminal or putty in Windows ) to console into the server over a serial cable .
To set this up , you need to edit /etc / inittab to tell it to start a terminal on the serial port for the console .
If you want to see the kernel load and see all the services start then you also need to configure grub to use the serial port as well .
Edit /etc / inittab and add the line starting with " co " to the file ( substitute the device name of your serial port for ttyS0 below ) :
co:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty ttyS0 57600 vt100-nav # ADD THIS LINE 1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty 1 2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty 2 3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3 4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4 5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5 6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6
To watch the kernel load ( and all the services ) you must configure grub to enable the console option in the kernel on boot .
Edit / boot / grub.conf and add the " serial " and " terminal " lines below , and modify the " kernel " line to include the console specification :
serial -- unit=0 --speed=57600 terminal -- timeout=5 serial console title CentOS ( 2.6.9-55.0.2.EL ) root ( hd 1,0 ) kernel / vmlinuz - 2.6.9-55.0.2.EL ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 console=ttyS0,57600n8 initrd /initrd-2.6.9-55.0.2.EL.img
To connect to the server just hook a serial cable from your laptop to the server .
Set the speed to 57600 , no parity and 8 bits .
Boot up the server , you should see kernel output , services load , and finally a login prompt .
After you disconnect you can easily re-connect and log in : just fire up your terminal emulator , connect your serial cable , hit enter a few times and you should get a prompt to log in .

When discussing high - frequency trading , Zero Hedge recently asked " As Goldman is becoming the primary conduit of trading ( whether principal or agency ) in virtually all markets , the risk of a
massive liquidity drain becomes exponentially larger , and the risk of an exogenous event approaches LTCM and Lehman levels .
It is this key risk driver that regulators should be focusing on , instead of chasing and attempting to punish the perpetrators of the most recent market crash ( we are not saying they should not , but they should prioritize and now should focus on what is most critical to maintaining a functioning market topology ) .
"
It seems we were wrong about authoritarian figures never predicting the implicit risk of this subset of program trading - ironically , it was well over 20 years ago and none other than the future Chairman of the Federal Reserve Larry Summers who had some prophetic words of caution .
In a paper titled " Commentary on ' Policies to Curb Stock Market Volatility " in which Larry was discussing the cause and effect of Black Monday ( about which he is quite wrong that nobody had seen coming ) , he lays out some oddly forward looking observations about program trading , or positive - feedback trading as high frequency trading was yet to become a staple market diet .
" In any event , positive - feedback trading is likely to increase volatility substantially .
If one wants to design regulatory interventions that will decrease volatility , one must think about measures that will discourage positive - feedback trading rather than negative - feedback trading .
Positive - feedback trading is substantially discouraged when traders using that strategy suffer massive losses , which is what one observed after the crash .
Everyone who had been pursuing positive - feedback strategies bought more and more as the market went higher and higher , thinking that their portfolio insurance would enable them to get out .
They were wrong .
It 's clear that the crash reduced volatility by reducing the attractiveness of positive - feedback trading . "
And some very peculiar observations on margin requirements by Larry , which may have much to do with why it has become so difficult to borrow any heretofore presumed liquid stock :
" More generally , the case for margin requirements raises a question .
Instead of asking why the market fell 500 points in one day , it might be more important to know why the market reached 2700 in the first place .
Low margin requirements , by encouraging positive feedback trading , may well have encouraged the market increase , setting the stage for the crash . "
Could it be that Larry is attempting to negate the positive feedback implications of program trading and other + feedback trading patterns by enacting higher margin requirements ?
That would be quite a departure , as it would mean that Goldman Sachs is in fact taking advantage of Larry 's policies as they impact traditional market mechanisms ( the stock loan houses State Street and BoNY in particular ) , by taking the other side of the positive feedback trade .
Consider this in the context of the elimination of market diversity that Zero Hedge discussed in the above referenced article .
A highly insightful paper , definitely worth your read , written by a much younger and much less conflicted Larry Summers ( notable phrase : " I conclude that it may be noise rather than news that is driving the market . "
Zero Hedge agrees wholeheartedly that the N in CNBC stands for noise ) .
And to conclude , a phenomenal Yale / London School of Economics paper discussing the explicit risk of High Frequency Trading .
The authors argue that you can get a liquidity hole due to leveraged short - term traders ( e.g. , HFTs ) driving prices far above what risk - averse long - term investors will buy them at .
If the market falls due to an exogenous event , herding behavior , and loss limits , then prices may need to fall a long way until they hit the residual demand curve at which risk - averse long - term value investors will buy .
Perhaps Larry should have read this paper when he was considering Black Monday - both the one in 1987 and the upcoming one , compliments of HFT and its # 1 purveyor .

ECONOMISTS have long recognised the arguments for imposing special taxes on goods and services whose prices do not reflect the true social cost of their consumption .
Such taxes are known as “ Pigouvian ” after Arthur Pigou , a 20th - century English economist .
Environmental taxes are an obvious example .
There is also a Pigouvian case for duties on cigarettes , alcohol and gambling .
Smoking increases the risk of cancer for those in the vicinity of the smoker ; alcohol abuse and gambling are strongly associated with violence and family breakdown .
Moreover , all three habits lead to higher medical costs .
In theory governments can make up these costs , or “ externalities ” , with a tax that adjusts the prices people pay to puff , booze or punt .
Such a tax might also encourage consumers to live healthier lives .
Support for another such tax , on junk food , is now spreading , especially in America .
Congress is considering a tax on sugary drinks to help pay for the planned expansion of health - care coverage .
Some analysts would like to see broader duties on junk food .
On July 27th the Urban Institute , a think - tank in Washington , DC , proposed a 10 % tax on “ fattening food of little nutritional value ” that , it claimed , would raise $ 500 billion over ten years .
The logic for a tax on fattening food may seem obvious .
About one - third of Americans are obese , up from 15 % in 1980 .
Fat people are more prone to heart disease , diabetes , bone disorders and cancer .
An obese person 's annual medical costs are more than $ 700 greater than those of a comparable thin person .
The total medical costs of obesity surpass $ 200 billion a year in America , which is higher than the bill for smoking .
These costs are not all borne by the obese .
When health - care costs are shared , obesity becomes a burden for everyone .
Thanks to government health - care plans such as Medicare half of America 's obesity - related health costs land on taxpayers .
In private employer - sponsored health plans the slim pay similar premiums to the overweight .
But would a fat tax affect behaviour ?
Numerous studies have shown a relationship between the price of food , especially junk food , and body weight .
As fast food has become relatively cheaper , so people have become fatter .
A new paper * from the RAND Corporation , another think - tank , suggests that taxing calories could have a sizeable , if gradual , effect on people 's weight .
The authors of the study look at changes in the weight and height of a large group of Americans aged over 50 between 1992 and 2004 .
They then calculate food - price indices that are skewed towards calorie - dense foods ( so a change in the price of butter has more impact than a change in the price of vegetables ) .
By controlling for individual and environmental influences on weight , such as income and health , they then measure whether food - price changes affect body - mass index ( BMI ) .
BMI , the ratio of weight in kilograms to the square of height in metres , is a common , if imperfect , gauge of whether someone is over - or underweight .
A person 's BMI turns out to be hard to shift in the short term .
A 10 % increase in the calorie - heavy price index is associated with a small decline , of 0.22 , in BMI within two years .
But the effects are greater over the longer term .
A 10 % increase in the price of calories results in a fall in BMI of one to two points over 20 to 30 years .
Such a drop would eliminate about half of the observed increase in obesity in America since 1980 .
Even so , the idea of tackling obesity via the tax system has some serious flaws .
First , there is the question of what to tax .
Sugary drinks may not be nutritious , but hamburgers contain some protein along with their fat .
More important , junk food is not itself the source of the externality — the medical costs that arise from obesity .
Unlike smoking , or excessive gambling and drinking , eating junk food does not directly impair the well - being of anyone else .
And because obesity is determined by lack of exercise as well as calorie intake , its ultimate relationship with health costs is more tenuous than that of , say , smoking .
It is possible to eat a lot of fatty food , exercise frequently and not generate any externalities .
A more direct , though controversial , approach would simply be to tax people on the basis of their weight .
Fat chance
The distance between junk food and the medical costs of obesity means that a calorie tax could have unintended consequences .
A new theoretical paper in the Journal of Public Economics even suggests that a tax on junk food could increase obesity , especially among physically active people .
If junk food , which is quick and easy to obtain , becomes relatively dearer , people will spend more time shopping for fresh ingredients and preparing food at home .
That could leave less time for exercise .
Even if perverse consequences of this type look improbable , a junk - food tax may have less impact than its advocates expect .
New studies on the effect of cigarette and alcohol sin taxes suggest heavy users are less influenced by price changes than others .
An analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health shows that American teenagers who smoke more than five cigarettes a day are only one - third as responsive to cigarette prices as lighter smokers .
A complementary study of data from America 's Health and Retirement Survey shows that alcohol taxes are far less effective for the large minority of heavy drinkers .
The biggest consumers of fattening food may prove similarly resilient to price increases , so a fat tax may do little to improve health , at least for today 's junk - food addicts .
If these same consumers are poorer on average , it would also be regressive .
One reason for this is that in some poorer neighbourhoods there may be little fresh food on sale .
If junk is all there is , putting up its price will reduce real incomes and make little difference to eating habits and health .
Like the foods they aim at , fat taxes look appetising but can have nasty effects .

After a day , using it felt like the most natural thing ever .
I never noticed how much time I 've spent pinpointing a workspace from FvwmPager until I used xmonad 's key bindings to do the same .
The tiling layout is , even with default settings , very nice .
I think I 'm finding focusing on the current task easier , already .
I have n't yet got into it , but getting to configure the WM using Haskell sounds very nice .
Fvwm 's configuration files were always incurably ad hoc .
I can already see myself configuring the WM to do tasks that I used to do by dragging the mouse to and fro with a few key presses .
I expect that I 'll end up using XMonad itself to implement lightweight GUIs for some common admin tasks I do .
It 's lovely .
Now I wish that apps were written more with hookability in mind .
It 'd be trivial to write handlers for just about anything with XMonad .
I could say a few words about how apps manage focus , now that I 'm not using my mouse quite as much .
Looks like Haskell libraries are starting to shape up within Debian .
I wrote a script to generate binNMU requests and already sent one .
I do n't know if there was such a tool already somewhere , but writing something that works did n't take quite that many hours .
I started with Perl but quick turned to Haskell , instead .
Turning it into something generally useful would take a bit longer .
That 's something for some other day .
I suppose I could put the code on a darcs repository .

Wat is de betekenis van Kerst ?
Het woord Kerstmis betekent eigenlijk Christus - mis , omdat dit feest gewijd is aan de geboorte van Jezus die de christus ( de gezalfde ) wordt genoemd .
Het woord kerst is uit het woord christus ontstaan ; zo betekent " kerstenen " bijvoorbeeld " christelijk maken " .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan ’s only known pig trotted out of quarantine Saturday , two months after he was locked away because of swine flu fears , to bask again in the mud at the Kabul Zoo .
Afghans look at Afghanistan 's only known pig in Kabul Zoo July 4 , 2009 .

The pig , a curiosity in Muslim Afghanistan where pork and pig products are illegal because they are considered irreligious , was quarantined because visitors to the zoo were worried it could spread the new H1N1 flu strain , commonly known as swine flu .
“ Our people did not understand that the disease only passes from person to person and felt that the swine influenza might even be spread from the zoo because we have a pig here , ” zoo manager Aziz Gul Saqib told Reuters .
“ Other zoos abroad told us not to worry ... when people began to realize the disease does n’t come from the pig itself we decided to release the pig , ” he said .
“ Khanzir ” -- Pashto for pig -- appeared unperturbed as a team of zoo workers used sticks to gently prod him out of his temporary concrete home into his usual enclosure of lush green shrubs and a mud puddle .
Unsuspecting zoo visitors scattered as Khanzir dashed through the center of the zoo toward his enclosure .
One visitor , 17 - year - old - Razaa , covered his nose and mouth with his t- shirt as the animal trotted past .
“ It ’s a pig , it ’s the dirtiest thing , it might give me a disease , ” he said .
Two goats grazed quietly as their portly , pink porcine pal enthusiastically rubbed his snout in a small pool of mud .
Some human onlookers were not so comfortable .
“ It is very haram ( forbidden ) and should not even been looked at .
I do n’t think it should even be in the zoo , ” said another visitor named Nassim .
But others were intrigued .
“ I think it ’s an interesting animal in terms of the way it looks .
You ca n’t really use it for anything ... it is haram and you should n’t eat it , ” said 22 - year old biology student Fatemeh .
Shabby and run-down , Kabul Zoo suffered badly during Afghanistan ’s three decades of war but is slowly improving .
Mujahideen fighters ate the deer and rabbits and shot dead the zoo ’s sole elephant during the 1992 - 94 civil war .
Incoming shells shattered the aquarium .
Khanzir , who is about eight or nine years old according to Saqib , was one of a pair given to the zoo by China in 2002 .
His partner died about two years ago .
Afghanistan has reported no cases of the H1N1 flu virus .
The June " Jobs " report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) on July 2 caused shock and dismay .
Payrolls declined by 467,000 jobs , more than the 345,000 lost in May , and much more than the 363,000 that economists had predicted .
The only reason that the reported unemployment rate rose by only 0.1 percentage points ( to 9.5 % ) in June was that many jobless people became discouraged and stopped looking for work .
As bad as the BLS report was , it should not have come as a surprise .
The deteriorating employment situation could have been predicted as early as April 29 , when the " Gross Domestic Product : First Quarter 2009 ( Advance ) " report was issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) .
The BEA numbers ( which were revised slightly on June 25 ) show an accelerating decline in " real nonresidential fixed investment " .
This measure decreased 37.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009 , compared with a fall of 21.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Given that employment is a direct , linear function of private business investment ( PBI ) , unemployment can be expected to rise much farther in the months ahead .
Here 's why .
Because a lot of PBI goes toward offsetting depreciation and increasing productivity , it takes a 5 % year - over - year increase in PBI to produce a 1 % increase in the number of jobs .
Correspondingly , a 5 % decrease in PBI will yield a 1 % reduction in total employment .
The unemployment rate a year ago was 5.5 % .
Because the potential labor force is growing , we need employment to increase by 1 % annually to keep the unemployment rate from going up .
The 37.9 % investment decline reported by the BEA can be expected to eventually produce a reduction in total employment of about 8.5 % .
Accordingly , we can expect unemployment to rise to about 14 % within a year unless the downward slide of PBI is reversed .
The current 9.5 % unemployment rate is causing great economic pain , and life with a 14 % jobless rate would be much , much worse .
Unfortunately , almost everything that the government has done or is proposing to do to right the economy is actually counterproductive .
Like the Bush administration before it , the Obama team is pinning its hope for economic recovery on " stimulus " .
Despite the fact that Bush 's $ 168 billion stimulus package in early 2008 had no impact at all , Obama rammed a $ 787 billion stimulus bill through Congress in January .
Now the administration is waiting anxiously for the " stimulus " to take effect .
It should not hold its ( collective ) breath .
" Stimulus " is based upon the superstition that government borrowing and spending creates " demand " .
In reality , it does no such thing .
" Stimulus " is like trying to raise the level of the Hudson River by dipping out a bucket of water , walking five feet downstream , and pouring it back in .
The only difference between the Bush and Obama plans is that Obama 's bucket is bigger ( and will create more debt ) .
Ironically , the July 2 jobs report prompted calls from leftist economists for Obama to go back to the river with an even bigger bucket .
While doing nothing to boost demand , Obama 's " stimulus " will depress PBI , and therefore employment .
This is because the " stimulus " plan requires selling an additional $ 787 billion in government bonds .
The money to buy these bonds will have to come from somewhere , and much of it will come from people who would otherwise invest in starting or expanding businesses .
Indeed , the bonds will have to be priced so that this risk - free investment is more attractive to investors than their other alternatives .
In the fourth quarter of 2008 , the Federal government ran a deficit of $ 303 billion ( and therefore had to sell $ 303 billion of new bonds ) and business investment fell by 21.7 % .
In the first quarter of 2009 , the Federal deficit was $ 650 billion and business investment fell by 37.3 % .
The economy is being forced to invest in Barack 's Bailout Bonds rather than in businesses that create jobs .
Virtually everything the Obama administration wants to do will have the effect of increasing unemployment .
As bad as joblessness is now , be prepared for it to get much , much worse .
LONDON  Michael O’Leary , chief executive of the European budget airline Ryanair , was discussing his new scheme to charge passengers to go to the bathroom .
Most passengers  the “ discretionary toilet visitors , ” as he calls them  would eventually forgo in - flight bathroom use altogether , he predicted .
Which is good , because he would also like to reduce the number of bathrooms per plane , to one .
What if the plane were stricken by some nasty , effluent illness , like food poisoning ?
A snorting noise wafted over from the chair where Mr. O’Leary was sitting .
“ We do n’t serve enough food for everybody to get food poisoning , ” he said .
At 48 , the quick - talking , blue - jean - wearing Mr. O’Leary is one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland , presiding over an airline that is , remarkably , flourishing in a brutal climate for airlines ( and most other businesses ) .
He is known for thick - skinned aggression , outrageous public statements and an implacable belief that short - haul airline passengers will endure nearly every imaginable indignity , as long as the tickets are cheap and the planes are on time .

Following the earlier court defeat for Fredrik , Gottfrid and Peter and the pending civil action taken by several Hollywood studios , the Swedish authorities have now ordered The Pirate Bay to be disconnected from the Internet .
The site 's bandwidth suppliers have been threatened with a large fine .
The site is completely offline .
Today , Stockholm ’s district court took action to completely remove The Pirate Bay from the Internet .
The court ordered the site ’s major bandwidth supplier , Black Internet , to disconnect TPB from the Internet or face penalties of 500,000 kroner ( $ 70,600 ) .
The ISP complied , saying that it had no choice but to uphold the law .
The censorship of The Pirate Bay will continue pending the outcome of a civil action taken by several entertainment companies including Disney , Universal , Warner , Columbia , Sony , NBC and Paramount .
Rick Falkvinge , leader of The Pirate Party said : “ This is absolutely ridiculous .
The Court seems to consider themselves above the Constitution , ” while criticizing the effect that these civil actions are having on freedom of speech .
“ This clarifies how copyright law has become untenable , and how information is lacking political skills in the judiciary , ” he added .
Black Internet is probably not the only supplier of bandwidth to The Pirate Bay , so it may be possible for them to reconnect to the Internet elsewhere .
Whether or not another Swedish supplier would even consider doing that is seriously in doubt .
Update :
As expected , The Pirate Bay site relocated and is back online ( DNS still has to update for some people ) .
A Pirate Bay insider told TorrentFreak that they “ got a new connection to the net . ”
The tracker is still down and is expected to be fully operational tomorrow morning , we were told .
Ever since their servers were raided back in 2006 they were prepared for takedown attempts like this .
“ The MAFIAA has spent millions of dollars and endless amounts of time to get this ban in order .
Our guess is that they also bribed a bit to get it since it violates so many laws not only in Sweden but also in the EU , not to mention violations against human rights .
And what do they have to show for it ?
3 hours of partial downtime , ” the Pirate Bay team adds .
The t- shirt below ( currently the logo on the Pirate Bay homepage ) will be sent to the people responsible for the takedown attempt tomorrow morning , the Pirate Bay insider told TorrentFreak .
Another update :
The temporary host has a problem with its fiber causing the site to go offline again .
Meanwhile , the downtime is causing traffic spikes for other torrent sites and trackers .
And another update :
The site is back online .

We would n't really say we " have it together " when it comes to remembering where we put our keys / phone / small children , so Apple 's announcement of the Find My iPhone service for MobileMe users came as quite a relief .
The service just went live , and with a quick toggle of a preference pane in iPhone OS 3.0 the phone is fully prepared for all sorts of lost and found scenarios -- along with acting as an incredibly intuitive ( if pricey ) stalking mechanism .
Find My iPhone works exactly as advertised , giving us a fairly good location estimate from within our lead - lined underground fortress , and sending annoying messages to the phone complete with sound , even when the handset is switched to silent , though unfortunately the sound is a sort of sonar ping that strikes us as incredibly difficult to locate , unless of course our phone is taken by whale .
The only other problem is that both the location function and the message service took a couple minutes to track down our iPhone -- not a deal breaker , but we do n't know what the hangup could be .
After the device is pinged , a confirmation of the event was sent to our MobileMe email address .
A live , enthralling video demonstration is after the break .

Hundreds of images derived from classified data that could be used to better understand rapid loss and transformation of Arctic sea ice should be immediately released and disseminated to the scientific research community , says a new report from the National Research Council .
That was the opening paragraph when I set this news article aside for possible posting .
The Feds actually responded that afternoon :
Ice on the East Siberian Sea in 2008
The United States released more than a thousand intelligence images of Arctic ice to help scientists study the impact of climate change , within hours of a recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences .
In an unusually fast move by a U.S. government agency , the Interior Department made the images public on Wednesday .
The academy ’s report urging this action was released at 11 a.m. on Wednesday .
Some 700 images show swatches of sea ice from six sites around the Arctic Ocean , with an additional 500 images of 22 sites in the United States …
The Arctic images have a resolution of about 1 yard ( 1 meter ) , a vast improvement on previously available pictures of sea ice , said Thorsten Markus of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center .
“ That does n’t happen every day , ” said a person familiar with the government ’s decision .
“ This is a great example of good government cooperation between the intelligence community and academia .
In the science community , we call it a no - brainer . ”
Until this administration , questions of science and politics were decided by hacks with No Brains .
Similarities in brain activity during lucid dreaming and psychosis suggest that dream therapy may be useful in psychiatric treatment , a European Science Foundation ( ESF ) workshop has found .
This is strengthened by the potential evolutionary relationship between dreams and psychosis .
Lucid dreaming - when you are aware you are dreaming - is a hybrid state between sleeping and being awake .
It creates distinct patterns of electrical activity in the brain that have similarities to the patterns made by psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia .
Confirming links between lucid dreaming and psychotic conditions offers potential for new therapeutic routes based on how healthy dreaming differs from the unstable states associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders .
New data affirms the connection by showing that while dreaming lucidly the brain is in a dissociated state , according to Ursula Voss from the University of Frankfurt in Germany .
Dissociation involves losing conscious control over mental processes , such as logical thinking or emotional reaction .
In some psychiatric conditions this state is also known to occur while people are awake .
" In the field of psychiatry , the interest in patients ' dreams has progressively fallen out of both clinical practice and research .
But this new work seems to show that we may be able to make comparisons between lucid dreaming and some psychiatric conditions that involve an abnormal dissociation of consciousness while awake , such as psychosis , depersonalisation and pseudoseizures . " said the workshop 's convenor Silvio Scarone , from the Università degli Studi di Milano in Milan , Italy .
Meanwhile , the previously discredited idea of treating some conditions with dream therapy has attracted interest from clinicians .
An example is people suffering from nightmares can sometimes be treated by training them to dream lucidly so they can consciously wake up .
" On the one hand , basic dream researchers could now apply their knowledge to psychiatric patients with the aim of building a useful tool for psychiatry , reviving interest in patients ' dreams , " continues Scarone .
" On the other hand , neuroscience investigators could explore how to extend their work to psychiatric conditions , using approaches from sleep research to interpret data from acute psychotic and dissociated states of the brain - mind . "
The existence of such psychotic conditions may be rooted in the evolutionary role of dreams , where dreaming is thought to have emerged to enable early humans to rehearse responses to the many dangerous events they faced in real life .
Developed by Antti Revonsuo at University of Turku in Finland , if this threat simulation theory is correct it may have origins even further back in evolution , given that other mammals such as dogs also exhibit the characteristic electrical activity of dreaming .
Researchers also looked at the idea that paranoid delusions and other hallucinatory phenomena occur when the dissociative dreaming state involving replay of threatening situations is carried through into wakefulness .
" Exposure to real threatening events supposedly activates the dream system , so that it produces simulations that are realistic rehearsals of threatening events in terms of perception and behaviour , " said Scarone .
" This theory works on the basis that the environment in which the human brain evolved included frequent dangerous events that posed threats to human reproduction .
These would have been a serious selection pressure on ancestral human populations and would have fully activated the threat simulation mechanisms . "
However , dreaming is unlikely to have evolved purely to recreate threats .
It may also have a role in the learning process , according to Allan Hobson , a psychiatrist and dream researcher recently retired from Harvard University in the US .
Contents are added while you are awake and integrated with the automatic program of dream consciousness during sleep .
This works with observations that daytime learning is consolidated by night - time sleeping , leading to the phenomenon where people remember facts better the day after they have learnt them than at the time .

In Japan , they know all about the three wise monkeys , who see no evil , hear no evil , and speak no evil – because one has his hands over his eyes , another over his ears , and the third over his mouth .
So if you want to level a gentle insult at a group wilfully ignoring what is in front of them , you can call them the " three wise monkeys " – so long as your audience gets the reference .
But not everyone does , as four activists in public sector union Unison have discovered .
They have been disciplined for distributing an " offensive " leaflet which carried a drawing of the proverbial monkeys .
The cartoon was interpreted as a racist slur against a fellow activist – a charge the four vehemently deny .
They say no one could believe they intended a racist insult , and that they are victims of a " witch hunt " by New Labour loyalists , who control the union .
The four have been barred from holding office in the union , but have taken their case to appeal – which begins today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The row dates from an incident nearly two years ago , when supporters of the Socialist Party – a Marxist group well to the left of Labour – tried to get Unison 's annual conference to discuss proposals to cut links with the Labour Party , and reduce the pay of full - time union officials .
Unison is one of the biggest donors to Labour , despite occasional friction .
The rebels were told by Unison 's standing orders committee , which determines what can be discussed at conference , that there were more important matters to be debated in the available time .
Irritated by this , they distributed a hastily printed leaflet with a cartoon that compared the committee with the three wise monkeys .
The only member of the committee familiar to most Unison members is Clytus Williams , the chairman .
He is a lay union activist and well liked by most delegates .
He is also black .
The idea the far left was trying to caricature him as a monkey infuriated delegates , many of whom are low - paid workers more familiar with bar room racism than Buddhist culture and proverbial monkeys .
Four members of the Socialist Party , Glenn Kelly , Onay Kasab , Suzanne Muna and Brian Debus – who all hold unpaid offices in Unison branches – were ruled to have distributed " offensive " material , and barred from office – though investigators accepted there was no " racist intent " .
Their cause has been taken up by comedians Rory Bremner and Mark Thomas .
Mr Bremner said : " On the face of it , Unison are about to make themselves a laughing stock .
They need to be aware of the ridicule this will attract to the union and its leaders , and think again before the papers get hold of this and make them look foolish and authoritarian . "
Mr Thomas said : " I know Onay Kasab .
To accuse him of being racist is utter stupidity and madness .
Those who brought this charge need to take a lie down in a quiet room , possibly with whale music playing and get a rest . "
Labour MP , John McDonnell , a veteran critic of New Labour , said : " Unison 's leadership are doing the bosses a favour .
It is a political witch hunt . "
A spokeswoman for Unison said : " We confirm a National Executive Council panel found these members breached several Unison rules , which require ' members , activists , representatives and staff , are treated with dignity and respect at all times when participating in the union 's democratic structures ' .
As there may be an appeal , the union is unable to add more until this is concluded . "
There are three types of Fresnel lenses , linear , spot , an continuous linear .
Linear and spot lenses look similar in terms of the circular Fresnel pattern but a spot lens may appear more transparent .
Spot lenses produce a very small tight beam at the optimal focal length and are generally more powerful size for size .
Linear lenses produce a longer flat beam ranging from 1 inch high by 3 inches wide up to 1 " x 12 " .
Continuous linear lenses are rarely used and produce a beam the length of the lens much like a parabolic trough .
Optically stable UV inhibitors are required for lenses experiencing solar exposure to the sun or the materials will deteriorate rapidly with sun exposure .
Linear Fresnel Lens Advantages :
 Less chance of damaging equipment if liquid evaporates
 Long beam can be spread the length of a pipe
 Powers a Steam Engine slower but more safely
Disadvantages :
 More opaque due to physical nature , less light ( power ) transferred to project
 Cannot be used for melting metals
Beam NOT continuous Linear like a trough ( 1 " tall x 3 " - 6 " wide optimal )
Spot Fresnel Lens Advantages :
 High power heat transfer ( available in Crystal Clear Acrylic perfection cutting )
 Can be set to less of a focal length ( ideal for cooking )
 Melts copper and many other materials
 Powers a Sterling Engine and Steam Engine
Disadvantages :
 Instant flame and work hazard
 Equipment damage
 Does not spread over a pipe surface evenly

Forget WAV , MP3 and M4A – major labels have something new in mind , and it 's called CMX .
Sony , Warner , Universal and EMI are reportedly preparing a new digital album format that will include songs , lyrics , videos , liner notes and artwork .
The news comes just weeks after reports of a similar project , Cocktail , being developed by Apple .
According to the Times , Apple rejected CMX and instead began work on an in - house alternative .
It is not clear how Cocktail and CMX will differ , other than ownership .
" Apple at first told us that they were not interested , but now they have decided to do their own , in case ours catches on , " a label rep told the Times .
" Ours will be a file that you click on , it opens and it would have a brand new look , with a launch page and all the different options .
When you click on it you 're not just going to get the 10 tracks , you 're going to get the artwork , the video and mobile products . "
However , this may be of little interest if CMX is n't compatible with iTunes , the default music software for iPods , iPhones and Apple computers .
Whereas labels are eager to resuscitate the album format in an age of singles , Apple is concerned with selling hardware , including a tablet computer rumoured to be launching this fall .
The major labels plan to launch CMX , which is just a working title for the format , in November .
It will reportedly be " soft - launched " with a few select releases .
" We are not going out in force , " the industry source said .
" What you are going to see is a couple of releases thrown out there to see what people like .
We are working with the retailers now . "

MEXICO CITY  Armed men dressed as Mexican federal police officers entered a heavily guarded prison in the northern state of Zacatecas early Saturday morning and freed more than 50 inmates , many of whom were believed to be drug traffickers allied with the powerful Gulf Cartel , the authorities said .
The huge jailbreak , which took place about 5 a.m. , was an embarrassment to the government of President Felipe Calderón , who has touted the arrests of thousands of drug traffickers over the last two years as evidence that organized crime groups were on the defensive .
The team of criminals who gained entry to the prison in Cieneguillas showed how vulnerable Mexican institutions remain .
The men arrived in a caravan of 15 vehicles with police markings as well as in a helicopter , according to news reports .
To gain entry , the gunmen claimed that they were carrying out an authorized prisoner transfer .

LABOR & EMPLOYMENT LAW —

Fully inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination
Act introduced in the Senate
A bipartisan bill ( S. 1584 ) that would provide employment discrimination protections to individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity was introduced in the Senate on August 5 , 2009 .
Called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ( ENDA ) , the bill would extend federal employment laws , which currently prevent employment discrimination on the basis of race , religion , gender , national origin , age and disability , to also cover sexual orientation and gender identity .
The lead sponsors of the measure are Senators Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) , Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) , Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) and Susan Collins ( R - ME ) .
They were joined in the August 5 , 2009 , introduction of the bill by 34 other members of the Senate .
This is the first time that a transgender - inclusive version of the bill has been introduced in the Senate .
The House introduced an inclusive version of ENDA in June 2009 ( see ¶69,212D ) .
ENDA would prohibit employers , employment agencies , labor organizations and joint labor - management committees from firing , refusing to hire , or discriminating against those employed or seeking employment , on the basis of their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity .
The four main co-sponsors released statements regarding the bill .
" There is no place in the workplace for employment discrimination , " said Senator Merkley .
" No worker in America should be fired or denied a job based on who they are .
Discrimination is wrong , period .
I 'm proud to join Senator Kennedy , who is a civil rights legend , and Senators Collins and Snowe , both champions for equality , in taking this next step in our ongoing effort to create a more perfect union and guarantee every American , regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity , the right to earn a living . "
" The promise of America will never be fulfilled as long as justice is denied to even one among us .
The Employment Non-Discrimination
Act brings us closer to fulfilling that promise for gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender citizens .
I 'm proud to join Senators Merkley , Collins and Snowe in introducing this important legislation , " said Senator Edward M. Kennedy .
" This legislation is long overdue .
We cannot continue to allow two standards of rights in the workplace , based on sexual orientation or identity , " said Senator Olympia Snowe .
" Ensuring equality for all Americans is the least we can do in living up to the standards of inclusion that this nation is built upon .
There is no place for discriminating against any of our citizens for whatever reason and I commend my colleagues for their willingness to champion equal rights for every American . "
" Similar to the current law in several states , including Maine , and the policies of many Fortune 500 companies , the Employment Non-Discrimination
Act would close an important gap in federal civil rights laws by making it illegal to discriminate in employment based on sexual orientation .
Our legislation affirms the principle that individuals should be judged on their skills and abilities , and not by who they are . "
Other original cosponsors of ENDA include : Assistant Majority Leader Richard Durbin ( D - IL ) , Senators Daniel Akaka ( D - HI ) , Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) , Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) , Roland Burris ( D - IL ) , Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) , Ben Cardin ( D - MD ) , Bob Casey ( D - PA ) , Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) , Al Franken ( D - MN ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - NY ) , Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , Daniel Inouye ( D - HI ) , John Kerry ( D - MA ) , Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) , Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) , Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) , Patty Murray ( D - WA ) , Jack Reed ( D - RI ) , Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) , Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) , Jeanne Shaheen ( D - NH ) , Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) , Mark Udall ( D - CO ) , Tom Udall ( D - NM ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) and Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) .
Reactions .
The Employment Non-Discrimination
Act has been endorsed by national civil rights organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign , the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , the ACLU , labor organizations and more than 50 Fortune 500 companies .
" We are thrilled the Senate has introduced , for the first time , an Employment Non-Discrimination
Act that will protect the entire lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community .
We applaud the leadership of Senators Merkley , Collins , Kennedy and Snowe and look forward to working with them to pass these critical protections , " said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese .
" The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights strongly supports ENDA .
We believe that civil rights should be measured by a single yardstick , which means that workers should be hired or fired based on performance and qualifications , not on immutable characteristics such as race , gender , sexual orientation , or gender identity .
For too many Americans , this principle has little meaning , and this long overdue legislation will finally close a major gap in our nation 's civil rights laws , " said Wade Henderson , President of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights ( LCCR ) .
" We are so pleased that Senators Merkley , Collins , Kennedy and Snowe continue to take a lead role in advancing the rights of LGBT people .
This bill will ensure that protections against workplace discrimination are extended to all Americans including the transgender community .
There is no reason why people should lose their livelihood because of who they are .
This bill is a major step toward fairness , " said Mara Keisling , Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality .
" ENDA reflects the core US values of fairness and ensuring everyone is allowed to participate on a level playing field in the workplace .
People recognize that our nation as a whole benefits when everyone is allowed to contribute their talents and skills , free from discrimination , which is all ENDA seeks to do , " said Rea Carey , Executive Director , National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund .
" Nike has been a long time supporter of the passage of ENDA and is very encouraged that under the leadership of Senators Merkley , Collins , Kennedy and Snowe we are moving a step closer towards passage of this essential piece of legislation .
Diversity and inclusion at Nike is about respecting our differences , leveraging our strengths and maximizing opportunity for all .
These values make Nike a better company , ardently supportive of our employees , respectful of our consumers and more competitive in our industry .
In supporting ENDA , you support the conviction that every American deserves a chance to compete and prosper on a level playing field , " said Orson Porter , US Director of Government and Public Affairs , Nike Inc .
" Nationwide Insurance is proud to align with the federal government and other employers supporting the Employment Non-Discrimination Act .
This bill is an appropriate , no - cost measure that will have a positive impact on our country , by extending protection in the majority of US states where it remains legal to fire employees who are gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender , " said Steve Keyes , Vice President , Associate Relations & HR Policy , Nationwide Insurance .
" The Labor Movement holds as a guiding principle the belief that ' An injury to one is an injury to all . '
We all suffer when a worker is discriminated against , fired or harassed simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity .
That is why labor unions representing millions of workers have been negotiating contracts with sexual orientation and gender identity protections since 1975 and have long fought for passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ( ENDA ) .
It is a matter of simple fairness and workplace equality for which we in the Labor Movement have long fought .
We are proud to stand with Senator Merkley and the other Senate supporters of ENDA and look forward to celebrating the passage of this important worker protection , " said Annie Hill , Executive Vice President , Communications Workers of America ( CWA ) , AFL - CIO .
" This bill , if passed , will ensure workplace equality for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Americans , " said Christopher Anders , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel .
" Protecting the right of all Americans to make a living free from discrimination is critically important , particularly in this economy .
We 're grateful to Senator Merkley for introducing this landmark civil rights bill . "
The bill , which has 38 cosponsors , has been referred to the Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions .

“ Rod Coronado is not a terrorist , ” says Dean Kuipers , author of Operation Bite Back : Rod Coronado ’s War to Save American Wilderness and a longtime writer about the world of eco-activism .
Back in the 1980s and ’90s , during Rodney Coronado ’s radical sabotage campaigns on behalf of animals and the environment , terrorism was generally considered to mean violence against people .
Feeling strongly that the loss of any life was wrong and that casualties would harm the movement , Coronado took care to not hurt anyone as he liberated animals and burned down research facilities across the American West .
Charged with arson in 1995 , Coronado served four years in a medium - security prison and , in August of 2006 , was sentenced to eight more months for dismantling a government - owned mountain lion trap .
But over the years , the official definition of terrorism expanded .
Through the 1992 Animal Enterprise Protection Act , the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act , and the 2006 Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act , the federal government proclaimed that the tactics the radical animal - rights crowd had been using for years were now a form of “ terrorism ” and could be prosecuted much more harshly .
In 2007 , Coronado found himself standing before a judge once more –though not for property destruction , as his days of burning down buildings were long behind him , but for making a speech .
While giving a lecture about his past radical actions , Coronado answered an audience question about how to build an incendiary device out of a plastic jug , and for that , Coronado was charged with a felony and ultimately sent to federal prison for a year and a day .
Compared to other collared eco-activists who have been threatened with sentences of up to 20 years under the stricter federal laws , perhaps he got off easy .
Kuipers has been following Coronado ’s flame - broiled tale of radical action for 17 years and tells the whole story in Operation Bite Back .
Kuipers makes it clear that he does not advocate arson or property destruction , but challenges us to consider whether it ’s reasonable to apply the label of terrorist to someone who releases animals from a lab .
Q. How has the shifting definition of “ terrorism ” changed the environmental movement since the 1980s ?
A. I think a lot of the old - timers , the “ rednecks for wilderness ” –it ’s sort of where Earth First !
began , and Sea Shepherd too in a way –might pin a little bit of that expansion of the term “ terrorism ” on the late ’ 80s - ’90s anarchists who came into the scene .
Guys like Rod Coronado .
They changed things a lot because the original eco-radical [s ] , like Greenpeace , were sort of mainstream conservation guys — they called themselves conservationists .
Mostly they were white men who had parties out in the woods and ate steaks and drank whiskey .
They were kind of red- blooded Americans , like the heroes of The Monkey Wrench Gang .
And then this whole new contingent , right around 1990 , started coming in that was much more about anarchism and identity politics .
“ What do I believe , and how does that separate me from the rest of the world ? ”
People got into listing their issues .
“ I not only do n’t eat animals , but also I am transgendered and I have these piercings that are very important to me . ”
Those kind of issues just drove the old - timers insane , because all of those things started being in the radical journals : “ What are we going to do about the homophobia in our movement ? ”
Those are all important discussions , but they did n’t have anything to do with saving whales or species problems .
That was very disconcerting to the old school of the movement .
A lot of them kind of left the movement , because they did n’t think that was as important as saving a chunk of wilderness or preserving a specific species .
The use of the word terrorism was always around , even in the ’60s , early ’ 70s — but it was always rhetorical .
I think it was Ron Arnold who actually coined the term in 1982 : “ eco-terrorist . ”
But it was rhetorical at that time because eco-terrorism did n’t exist .
Unless you killed somebody , you were n’t a terrorist .
And they had n’t killed anybody , so there was n’t any eco-terrorism .
Changing [ terrorism ] laws [ to encompass environmental activism ] really came about because guys like Rod Coronado went further , started using arson .
The threat of more violence was sort of there in that movement and I do n’t think that went over very well with a lot of the conservation movement , and they kind of split off in a lot of ways .
So I think that the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front and people who modeled themselves after them have found themselves very isolated from the rest of the movement .
Q . Where do you see the eco-movement going from here ?
A. I think that the mainstream approach is totally taking over right now , and they ’re being successful .
Kind of all they had to do is wait out George Bush .
I think they have a very sympathetic ear right now .
All of the big groups — NRDC , the Sierra Club — are very effective right now .
They have sympathetic ears in Congress ; people like Henry Waxman [ chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and cosponsor of the House climate bill ] kind of took the key positions that they needed them to take .
The deck is loaded now for a lot of stuff to happen .
However , I think that the radical parts of the movement arise because of threat .
The global warming question will continue to get bigger , and species extinction and various types of animal abuse , for lack of a better word , are not going to get better .
So I think that that kind of action will rise .
I do n’t see that the terrorism laws have ever really stopped it because people — young people in particular — just assume they wo n’t get caught .
And they ’re right .
They ’ve hardly caught any of those people through the years , [ even though there have ] been over 1,200 actions and like a billion dollars worth of damage .
I think that the radicalism will rise if the mainstream movement fails to get anything done .
I think that ’s why there ’s always a radical element to any movement .
They ’re there to step it up and push everybody to a more aggressive position .
If they pass some real bullshit legislation about global warming that ’s basically full of loopholes and everybody can drive a Hummer , the radicalism will step up .
Q . How do people respond when you talk about your work ?
A . It depends on who it is .
There ’s such a huge community of people who believe in more radical action — called direct action — in solving environmental and animal rights problems that there ’s a lot of sympathy .
But there [ are ] a lot of people for whom Rodney Coronado is not radical at all and would like to see it go far beyond that .
But that ’s not the mainstream , and for the most part , mainstream America does n’t really want to get involved in this .
They still eat meat and they do n’t really want to think about factory farms or where their mink coat comes from .
Consciousness has definitely gone way , way up , but still it ’s a huge jump from being conscious about where your food comes from or where your coat comes from to being somebody who knows people who actually go out and do stuff about it , [ whether ] it ’s just legislation [ or ] actually trying to close a place down physically .
That ’s kind of shocking .
I ’m sure my family in Michigan would be a little bit appalled : “ Another book from Dean that we ca n’t read ! ”
Q . Have you faced conflicts within the mainstream media because there are stereotypes about environmental activists ?
A. I have n’t encountered that many serious challenges .
You have to dial things back .
You have to position them in such a way that the publication feels comfortable that you have n’t just completely denied one half of the story from getting its say .
Even when we know things are just absolutely for sure — something like a cancer cluster of people from asbestos — you ’ve still got to call for a comment from the asbestos department where they say , “ No , it ’s not us . ”
But I do that , so there have n’t been too many stories I ’ve brought to people where they ’ve just said , “ No , that ’s too radical for us . ”
Even in my book , I do n’t write about Rod Coronado saying that arson is awesome .
Arson is not awesome .
Arson sucks .
It ’s a thing that people should not do , but it ’s a tool that he used and I present it pretty matter of fact .
I ’m sure I will be accused of being an apologist for arson , but that ’s not my purpose .
But if I did write a book about that , I do n’t think it would be as good , because suddenly there ’s no reason for any of the farmers to talk to me , the FBI , the police .
All those guys have amazing and cool facts that I do n’t know , and I want all that stuff .
As long as we do that , I think the story gets better and people are more open to reading it .
I lose less of the audience .
You can make more of a difference .
Q . What originally drew you to writing about eco-radicalism ?
A. [ The actions ] happen in great locations .
I grew up in the woods in Michigan with a big hunting and fishing family .
I was living in New York City when I first started doing this stuff and really sweating it , and having a hard time getting myself out to the Catskills on the weekends to see some trees .
But there are whole protests that last for months happening in redwood groves in Northern California , and people trying to stop roads from being built into central Idaho , which is like God ’s Country .
It ’s just amazing there — huge contiguous pieces of roadless wilderness with wolves and moose .
Those are the kind of places I like to be in .
And on a boat with the Sea Shepherds out in the eastern tropical Pacific to Cocos Island or something — it ’s fantastic .
I ’m not only working on a story , but I ’m in the places I would like to see preserved .
Q. Does it water down our legitimate concerns about terrorism to have environmental and animal - rights activists looped into it ?
A. Sure .
I think it ’s an insult to the intelligence of the average American , that we ca n’t tell the difference .
But of course we can tell the difference !
Osama bin Laden goes on the TV on one of his Al Jazeera tapes and says , “ We will make the infidels pay , ” and that ’s about killing people .
The Militant Vegan League — which is something I ’m just making up — sends out their communiqué saying you have to stop hurting bunnies and you have to stop factory farming where you keep chickens in little cages .
It ’s just a completely unrelated issue in every way — strategically , philosophically , tactically , in every way .
Terrorism is such a strong word that it just allows the same kind of law enforcement tactics to be used to suppress it .
Q. What is the No. 1 message you want to stick with people after reading your book ?
A . What we were just talking about .
I picked out a particular person–Rod Coronado–to help me tell the story because I want it to be obvious by the time you get to the end that Rod Coronado is not a terrorist .
He ’s done lamentable things , he ’s burned things and attacked businesses and been very aggressive .
But he ’s never attacked any people .
He ’s an intelligent and respectful person who did things on principle and believed that he was executing the height of nonviolent direct action .
There ’s a difference between bursting into the Holocaust museum with a gun with the intention of “ I ’m going to kill a bunch of people to make a statement , ” and going into someplace late at night and burning their fence and making sure that no people are hurt because you want to make a statement .
We need to take some action to preserve the difference , for all kinds of reasons .
So that people do n’t rot in jail who do n’t need to for long periods of time .
So that we , as a country , are not spiritually affected by this —
I think that there ’s a price to pay when your country endorses things like torture , and calling people terrorists who are not terrorists plays into that .
You ’re falsely accusing certain sectors of the public of doing something they ’re not doing .
I also think that it ’s not that good for us environmentally , that we should n’t be able to demonize people who are trying to get a message across that many people would recognize as positive .

Many leaders in high places now [ 1955 ] promise us that our government will never again permit poverty and depression to devastate our land .
They propose more government spending as a cure for every economic evil .
And millions of people believe that such a program will work .
The underlying philosophy behind political spending is not new .
Similar ideas have appeared throughout all history .
They came to full flower shortly after the economic collapse of 1929 , when unbalanced budgets were generally accepted as necessary economic measures for relieving those in distress .
You could not let innocent people starve , could you ?
People pointed to idle factories , unemployed workers and their unsatisfied wants .
All we need to do , they said , is to get the government to start priming the pump .
A little government spending would provide the would - be workers with the wherewithal to buy the things they desperately need .
This would encourage businessmen to put the unemployed to work in the idle factories .
This solution sounded so simple , and its political appeal was apparent .
So we tried it .
People just plumb forgot all that economists had ever taught .
Many desperate persons reached for whatever share they could get of the apparent prosperity that followed .
Until war changed the picture , the price they paid was chronic unemployment by the millions .
Are we now asking for a repeat performance ?
Most people seem to forget that the government can pay out only what it borrows or collects in taxes .
They also forget one of the most elementary facts of a free economy — men who will not accept going wage rates must remain unemployed .
Likewise , they fail to understand the real causes of depressions .
A logical examination of pertinent data would show them that it was Federal Reserve money manipulation that brought on the depression we all deplore .
We Americans truly need to know some very simple economic facts .
No free man works , buys or sells unless he fully believes that such action will bring him greater satisfaction than he could enjoy if he did not take that action .
This means that in a free economy no man ever takes a job at any wage unless he believes he is better off working at that wage than he would be if he did not take it .
Likewise , no employer ever employs a man at any wage unless the employer feels that he will better his situation by employing that man at that wage .
So , in a free economy , employees and employers believe that they have the best available terms .
When they feel otherwise , they shift jobs or employees .
In the same vein , no woman ever buys a dress unless she believes that dress will bring her more satisfaction than any other use she could make of the same amount of money .
On the other side of the transaction , no storekeeper ever sells a dress unless he places a higher value on the money he receives than he does on the dress he sells .
As a result of the sale , both buyer and seller are happier .
Thus , in a free economy , every freely made transaction benefits all participants .
Consequently , any interference with freely made transactions must result in a decrease in the satisfaction and happiness of all persons concerned .
An economy that is free from restricting regulations thus permits its people to enjoy the greatest happiness they are capable of producing .
The Proper Sphere of Government
However , in order to enjoy the full pleasures of prosperity , it is necessary for peaceful people to be protected from all robbers , thieves and fraudulent schemers who seek something for nothing at the expense of their fellow men .
For this protective purpose , men have instituted governments .
Governments , like all valuable assets , have a price .
This price is collected in some form of taxes .
Reasonable taxes are a legitimate expense for all protected persons , property and production .
Taxes are like insurance premiums .
In fact , a good government might be called a form of life , fraud and robbery insurance .
It is as necessary for modern society as accident insurance is for every car driver of moderate means .
Without it , the risk of living , owning property and driving might well involve financial risks that only a few could afford .
Good governments permit people to pursue their pleasures and production while protected from the rascals who would infringe on their rights by force or fraud .
Taxes paid for this protection are an investment which permits men to pursue their personal satisfaction and prosperity as each one sees fit .
When governments spend money for other than protective purposes , they must first get that additional money .
They can only get such funds by one or more of three different methods .
They can amass such funds by collecting more ordinary taxes , borrowing from private savers , or simply printing the extra money they want to spend .
Most modern governments use all three methods .
Can such government spending increase the transactions and satisfactions of individuals and , thus , the happiness and prosperity of the people as a whole ?
A most common economic error is the failure to see or realize the complete price of what one buys .
People are too apt to reach for something they want now , without weighing the costs they cannot visualize at the moment .
Many fail to realize that more beer and merriment today may well mean no bread or meat tomorrow .
So it is with government spending .
We see the results of government spending all around us .
Government services are sold at bargain rates below cost .
The bureaucrats are good steady customers , and the subsidy receivers spend money more freely than those who earn it .
But many do not see the complete price .
They do not see the schools , homes , hospitals and factories that could have been erected if the same funds had been left in private hands .
They do not see that present bureaucrats could be private citizens producing goods not now available , and that such an increase in marketable goods would tend to reduce all prices and thus increase the satisfactions and living standards of every buyer .
They do not see the taxes that creep into the prices of every loaf of bread and pair of shoes , placing the prices of such necessities beyond the reach of the most needy .
When the government raises the money it spends by borrowing savings or taxing its citizens , it merely transfers spending power from private owners and earners of the money to the political spenders in power .
This creates no new wealth .
It reduces the amount private citizens can spend while increasing the amount government can spend .
With less money in their pockets and bank accounts , private individuals and corporations must reduce the amounts they spend or invest .
Assuming prices and wages remain the same , they must buy fewer goods and employ fewer workers on private payrolls producing what people want most .
Money spent by governments cannot create any more jobs or produce any more wealth than it can when spent by private persons .
In fact , it creates less , because both the tax collectors and tax spenders must be paid a commission .
Their labors add nothing to the wealth of society .
The shift of the money from private citizens to political spenders must result in fewer productive jobs , and thus a smaller amount of goods and higher prices than if the money had been left in private hands .
Pattern of Production Changed
Political spending also changes the whole pattern of the nation 's productive forces .
If the government spends its money by giving out subsidies to one privileged group , the productive facilities of the country are then partially directed toward satisfying the desires of that group instead of the desires of those who originally earned the money .
Many workers and investors must shift from producing goods and services for consumers who earn their money , to producing goods and services for those who first receive the dollars distributed during the government 's spending spree .
Then , too , much government spending is not based on the economic principle of getting the most for the least .
This permits political spenders to grant privileges to their friends .
Such political plums provide more satisfaction and prosperity for nonproducers at the expense of producers .
The net result must always be a reduction in the production of wealth .
Any such reduction in the quantity of goods and services available in the market tends to raise all prices and thus reduce the satisfactions and living standards of every buyer in that market .
So spending to help one group , laudable as it may seem , does not , and cannot , create general prosperity .
If the government spending is for war or defense , then some of the nation 's investors and workers must go to work producing munitions and military supplies .
All the savings and workers so engaged are withdrawn from industries satisfying the private needs and wants of individual consumers .
The end result , of course , is a reduction in the satisfaction of the needs and desires of all those who prefer consumer goods over war goods .
The nation may have full employment , but individuals must certainly get along with fewer consumer goods .
Such lower personal satisfactions have never been considered greater prosperity .
The only reason men and factories are ever unemployed is that they will not produce what consumers want most at prices consumers can and will pay .
Both men and factories can always be employed , if they will accept market wages and prices .
When they consider these too low and rely on government to pay higher than market wages and prices with funds obtained from private citizens , the immediate result must always be unemployment or lower wages for those formerly engaged in satisfying the desires of those whose money the government now spends .
Unless supported in idleness , these workers will soon gravitate to those industries or pursuits that benefit most from the increased government spending .
Their competition will bring wages down to market levels , and then no workers will any longer benefit from the increased government spending .
Any switch of money from private owners to political spenders can only result in a redirection of the nation 's productive forces and temporary gains for those who first receive the government orders or subsidies .
In the end , a readjustment of the nation 's productive forces will become necessary .
During the interim , total human satisfactions will be reduced and the general welfare will suffer .
The question now asked is whether a substantial reduction in present government spending would create a depression .
Under the present restrictive labor and monetary laws , the painful readjustment might well be long and severe .
Under a free economy , with free market wages and interest rates , the necessary readjustment could be quickly made and soon everyone would be enjoying a much higher living standard .
If the government reduces both taxes and spending , it will leave more money in private hands .
This money then can , and will , employ more people at higher real wages to make more of what people want most .
The nation 's productive forces would be redirected toward satisfying the wants of productive persons , rather than satisfying those who were the recipients of government expenditures .
In a free market economy , every worker and investor tends to seek those outlets which will produce what consumers want most , as indicated by the wages and prices consumers will pay .
So workers and investors now engaged in satisfying political spending would soon find more profitable outlets satisfying the increased spending of private producers .
Everyone would soon have more .
That is not a depression .
That is prosperity .
Results of Inflation
In cases where the government prints the money , either directly or indirectly , by first printing bonds and then issuing new money with only its own bonds as security , the result is inflation .
Inflation is a tax on everyone who owns or is owed a dollar .
Its effects are more hidden than those of other taxes .
Another important difference is that inflation transfers economic wealth from one group of people to another group , as well as from private citizens to their government .
The inflation tax is a boon to all who owe dollars and a burden on all who are owed dollars .
It changes the values of every contract that specifies a future payment in dollars .
It reduces the value of the money involved .
This is a temporary boon to the payer but , in effect , a tax on the recipient .
Under such inflationary conditions , wise businessmen become hesitant about signing long - term contracts , so necessary for our present - day complicated production system .
Government inflationary spending thus places an additional damper on prosperity , over and above all drawbacks and redirection of productive forces brought about by government spending of funds amassed by taxes or bond sales .
Those who first receive the newly printed money are able to buy a part of the nation 's production without having made any contribution .
They must profit at the expense of all those who have contributed to the total production offered on the market place .
Since the rewards of productive contributors are less , some will retire or reduce their future contributions to the market .
Production will be further reduced by the fact that some of the printed money recipients are supported in nonproductive pursuits .
Total production must , therefore , be lower .
This means there will be less for everyone who spends dollars in the market place .
Taxes which raise prices or curtail private spending cannot increase total human satisfaction .
Increased taxes reduce the voluntary transactions of a free people and thus reduce their total satisfactions .
Contrariwise , any reduction in government spending and taxing will increase the individual transactions of a free people and thus their individual satisfactions and prosperity .
The Way to Prosperity
Government spending is an expense or burden on total production and human satisfaction .
Government taxes are personal economic sacrifices and should be paid only for the protection of life and private property .
When taxes are so limited , they are an aid and stimulant to total production and human satisfaction .
When they are collected to help some at the expense of others , they are a brake on both production and human satisfaction .
Any reduction in government taxes and spending increases the goods and satisfactions available for all those who have dollars of their own to spend .
Competition in the service of consumers is the one and only sure way to produce a prosperity permanently spiraling upward .
All political spending for purposes beyond the protection of life and property are a snare and a delusion .
They discourage wealth production both by decreasing the rewards of productive workers and by supporting others in idleness or nonproductive pursuits .
In order to keep up the appearances of prosperity , government spending must be constantly increased , with an ever - increasing share of total production going to the nonproductive .
If these constantly increased expenditures are not stopped in time , the result will be a runaway inflation like that which took place in Germany in 1923 .
Government budgets balanced by inflationary spending can but bring a national headache , for which the only permanent cure is the intelligent use of our God - given freedom .
America 's Fritzl ?
No , Philip Garrido is Charles Manson Mark Two
Charles Manson mark II ?
Phillip Garrido
He is being called the American Fritzl - and given the remarkable similarities between their sickening crimes , the comparison with Austria 's arch sex - kidnapper is inevitable .
However , with his dark , remorseless eyes , skeletal features , receding hairline and thin lips , Phillip Garrido resembles an altogether different type of monster : the mass murderer Charles Manson .
Certainly , that 's what 's his own brother believes .
Ron Garrido compares
Phillip 's hold over his wife Nancy to Manson 's psychological control of his notorious Family .
' I told my wife , it 's no different to Manson and those girls , ' said Ron , 65 , a retired electrician .
' She was under his spell - a robot .
It just seems so bizarre .
Crazy , crazy , crazy . '
Quite so .
But listening to Garrido's deluded attempts to justify Jaycee 's abduction during a rambling radio interview from his prison cell yesterday , and examining his bizarre internet blog , it becomes clear that the likeness to Manson is more than physical .
Just like the twisted Californian cult leader , he is a dangerously self - absorbed narcissist .
And , as with the demented Manson , he is at pains to convince us that he possesses supernatural gifts and uses risible , quasi-religious mumbo- jumbo to mask his depravity .
Garrido calls his ludicrous blog Voices Revealed , and on it he purports to be able ' speak in the tongue of angels ' .
He also claims to be able to ' control sound with my mind ' , and to have invented a device through which to channel it .
He even depicts himself as some sort of messiah , and urges readers to follow him .
Charles Manson pictured in 1970 , and again in March this year , a Nazi tattoo visible on his forehead
At the time of his arrest , it would seem that no one had been gullible enough to do so .
Instead , the website has been turned into a bulletin board for outraged Americans to vent their disgust .
' Rot in hell , ' one message read , summing up the national mood .
But the question asked by millions of ordinary Americans this weekend is more prosaic : who is Garrido , and what possessed him to snatch a little girl from the school bus - stop , shut her away for his sexual fulfilment for 18 years , and father her two children ?
Phillip Garrido listens as his court - appointed attorney , Susan Gellman , enters a not guilty plea during his arraignment
Last night , the answers were starting to emerge .
Phillip Craig Garrido was born on April 4 , 1951 , the child of Manuel and Pat Garrido , and raised in Contra Costa County , the San Francisco Bay area of northern California .
By all accounts he was of reasonable intelligence , and graduated from Liberty Union High School in 1969 .
He was an impressive - looking young man , athletically built and 6ft 4in , and appears to have little trouble attracting girls .
In 1973 , he married his childhood sweetheart , Christine Perreira ( now Watson ) .
Contacted yesterday in the Mid West , where she lives with her new husband , she recalled how he had attempted to forge a career as a musician , but descended into drug abuse .
According to brother Ron , Phillip fled to Reno , Nevada , after learning that fellow - drug dealers ' had a contract out on him ' .
In November 1976 , Garrido claimed the first victim of his deviant sexual desires .
She was a 25 - year - old casino worker collecting groceries in the waterfront resort of South Lake Tahoe .
Garrido , then aged 25 , tapped on her car window and told her his vehicle had broken down .
He was sufficiently convincing for her to offer him a lift .
A court later heard how he handcuffed the terrified young woman , taped her mouth , and drove her to his secret lair in Reno - a warehouse which he had converted into his private lair .
There she was held for several hours whilst he raped and sexually assaulted her .
When police raided the storage unit , they found multi-coloured rugs covering the floors and walls , a stack of hard - core pornographic magazines , various sex aids and a spotlight to illuminate his perverted activities .
Perhaps this was an early prototype of the hideout where Garrido kept Jaycee , and who knows how many more victims he had imprisoned there for his gratification ?
Jaycee Lee Dugard was held captive for 18 years
At all events , another woman came forward to tell police that he had tried to kidnap her before hijacking the casino worker .
Garrido's defence lawyer blamed his crimes on a five - year addiction to LSD .
He was sentenced to 50 years in a federal penitentiary and five more in a state prison , but served only 11 years before being released in 1988 .
Three years into his sentence , Christine divorced him but he married again , to a Jehovah 's Witness who was the niece of another prisoner .
The ceremony was held behind prison walls in Leavenworth penitentiary , Kansas .
The bride was Nancy Garrido , the lank - haired , wretched - looking woman who was arrested with him , and must surely have been complicit in Jaycee 's kidnap , at the very least .
His neighbours in the San Francisco dormer town of Antioch , where he and Nancy settled after he was freed for jail , also knew about his past , for he did little to conceal it .
Garrido , his wife and her elderly mother lived in a quiet , residential area of the town , in a grey ranch - style house surrounded - very conveniently , as we now know - by thick , overgrown shrubbery and piles of rubbish .
As a legal requirement , Garrido was placed on the sexual offenders ' register for life after being released from prison .
This meant that he was required to keep regular meetings with a parole officer and have his movements followed via a satellite tag .
In recent years , however , he had been placed on ' passive monitoring ' , so the GPS tracking system was not activated .
Even last July , when his house was searched by a multi-agency task force as part of the sexual offenders ' compliance programme , the system lamentably failed .
Parallels :
The case of Joseph Fritzl stunned the world last year
" There were zero signs of kids living there , ' a local policewoman said .
Perhaps now , too late , we will find out why .
At all events , Garrido 's claims to have found God and become a reformed character barely stand up to scrutiny .
Only last year , police investigated claims that he preyed upon 79 - year - old Dilbert Medieros , swindling him out of his £ 12,000 life savings .
Garrido regularly collected the pensioner from his old folk 's residence and took him on outings .
Mr Medieros complained he tricked him into handing over his nest - egg after saying that he needed the money to start his own church .
Predictably , Garrido denied this , insisting that his ' friend ' had willingly donated the cash , and it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to bring a case against him .
Had he not become emboldened in recent days , taking his secret daughters out with him to distribute religious leaflets on a university campus , his run of luck might well have continued for many more years .
Now , thankfully , this unspeakable man has been locked away .
Like evil Charlie Manson , he will doubtless spend the rest of his life ranting about his ' unearthly powers ' from a prison cell .
" The more you give , the more you get .
For the great majority , [ the new service ] will be free of charge , for a minority it will actually make them money , and for a small portion it will cost them .
We know that unless we 're able to create revenues for the filesharers they 'll just move on to the next free site .
Filesharers are our best friends . "
When the Pirate Bay was suddenly and unexpectedly commandeered by Global Gaming Factory late last month , only a few clues were dropped as to how the new site would proceed as a legally acceptable entity .
Now , however , the owners are speaking up , and their business plan sure sounds unorthodox , if not fatuous in nature .
In a new report , we 're told that the new face of TPB should appear in around a month , and with the refresh will come a handful of " give - and - take " pay models that will somehow please both customers and the top brass within the music industry .
Here 's how Hans Pandeya , the chief executive of GGF , explains things :
Mr. Pandeya also affirmed that his outfit was currently in negotiations with some of the music industry 's biggest players , and while he would n't list 'em by name , he did note that things have been " positive " so far .
Another interesting aspect of all this is how it expects to generate revenue outside of actual music consumers .
Reportedly , the new site will raise cash " through advertising and by making network data traffic cheaper and more efficient for internet service providers , which would be done by making the filesharing more local , allowing users in the same city to be interconnected as opposed to swapping data across multiple borders . "
Is P2P 2.0 upon us ?
Is the conventional subscription model about to be turned upside down by a most unlikely source ?
If Hans ' dreams come true , it sure seems possible .
Even the recently ended Netflix contest , which offered $ 1 million to anyone who could significantly improve the company ’s movie recommendation system , was a battle waged with the weapons of modern statistics .
Though at the fore , statisticians are only a small part of an army of experts using modern statistical techniques for data analysis .
Computing and numerical skills , experts say , matter far more than degrees .
So the new data sleuths come from backgrounds like economics , computer science and mathematics .
They are certainly welcomed in the White House these days .
“ Robust , unbiased data are the first step toward addressing our long - term economic needs and key policy priorities , ” Peter R. Orszag , director of the Office of Management and Budget , declared in a speech in May .
Later that day , Mr. Orszag confessed in a blog entry that his talk on the importance of statistics was a subject “ near to my ( admittedly wonkish ) heart . ”
I.B.M. , seeing an opportunity in data - hunting services , created a Business Analytics and Optimization Services group in April .
The unit will tap the expertise of the more than 200 mathematicians , statisticians and other data analysts in its research labs  but that number is not enough .
I.B.M. plans to retrain or hire 4,000 more analysts across the company .
In another sign of the growing interest in the field , an estimated 6,400 people are attending the statistics profession ’s annual conference in Washington this week , up from around 5,400 in recent years , according to the American Statistical Association .
The attendees , men and women , young and graying , looked much like any other crowd of tourists in the nation ’s capital .
But their rapt exchanges were filled with talk of randomization , parameters , regressions and data clusters .
The data surge is elevating a profession that traditionally tackled less visible and less lucrative work , like figuring out life expectancy rates for insurance companies .
Ms. Grimes , 32 , got her doctorate in statistics from Stanford in 2003 and joined Google later that year .
She is now one of many statisticians in a group of 250 data analysts .
She uses statistical modeling to help improve the company ’s search technology .

For example , Ms. Grimes worked on an algorithm to fine - tune Google ’s crawler software , which roams the Web to constantly update its search index .
The model increased the chances that the crawler would scan frequently updated Web pages and make fewer trips to more static ones .
Pakistan Print This The U.S. Invades and Occupies Pakistan By Talha Mujaddidi .

We are watching it happen in the streets .
The recurring nightmare has become a grim , new reality for the people of Pakistan .
After watching the horrors of the U.S. invasions and occupations of Iraq and neighboring Afhanistan for 8 years , the " war on terror " has finally arrived in The Land of the Pure .
Obama is fulfilling his campaign promise to Pakistan .
The sudden arrival of U.S. marines , U.S. military Hummers , the hired killers of Blackwater , houses barricaded for U.S. personnel in Islamabad and the construction of the world 's largest U.S. " Embassy " are terrorizing this nation of 180 million people .
The U.S. slaughter and destruction in Iraq and neighboring Afghanistan for the last 8 years warn them of what may lie in store for them , their families , their land .
The U.S. Marines
On 9/21/08 a bomb ripped through the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad killing scores of people and injuring hundreds .
Prior to the bombing , U.S. marines off - loaded steel boxes from a truck , by - passed security and took them to the 4th floor of the building .
US officials refused to cooperate with the government 's attempts to investigate their activities .
One year later , U.S. Marines are leading the occupation of Pakistan .
Until this landing of U.S. forces , the nation 's spokesman for Foreign Affairs had been denying that 1000 U.S. marines were on their way to Islamabad .
The thousand marines are now in the capital city of Islamabad .
Some of them may be quietly slipping into Balochistan where the presence of JSOC ( Joint Special Operations Command ) have been reported by foreign journalists .
But most are here to defend what will be the largest U.S. embassy / fortress in the world , now under construction and to spearhead the invasion and occupation .
Costs to the U.S. Taxpayer US Ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson
The total cost for housing and and general support for the marines alone will be US $ 112.5 million .
US Ambassador Anne W. Patterson said the money is allocated as follows : " $ 5 million was for Marine quarters , $ 53.5 for housing infrastructure , $ 18 million for improvement of general services office area , and $ 36 million for temporary duty quarters and community support facilities . "
In Patterson 's explanation of the massive expansion of the U.S. Embassy she talked about 4 Billion ( that 's with a " B " ) dollars : " The embassy expansion , she said , was a reflection of the long - term commitment that the US intended to have with Pakistan .
Moreover , she said , quadrupling of the social , economic and military assistance that would touch $ 4 billion a year over the next 18 months , necessitated staff increase . "
Ambassador Patterson did not clarify whether the $ 4 Billion covers the construction which will make this embassy the largest in the world .
When this construction is seen in context and coordination with the new level of U.S. occupation of Pakistan , it looks more like a permanent military base than an embassy for running military and covert operations not only in Pakistan but also in the region .
Weapons and Hummers Eye witnesses and informed journalists have been reporting sightings of U.S. personnel in Islamabad for the past week or so , but now they are seen moving freely throughout the capital .
The law ( Section 144 ) provides that Pakistanis who own guns are not permitted to carry them in Islamabad .
But U.S. personnel are showing Pakistanis that they are above the law as they openly brandish their weapons .
It has also been confirmed that 3,000 U.S. military Hummers , locked and loaded are awaiting dispatch in Karachi's Port Qasim .
For millions of Pakistanis news of these Hummers conjures up images of U.S. troops charging through the streets of Iraqi cities , armed to the teeth , terrifying and often killing unarmed civilians .
On Feb. 23 , 2009 the Pentagon revealed that over 70 U.S. military advisers had been secretly working in Pakistan .
Blackwater and the CIA Pakistanis have known about the 300 U.S. military " advisers " lodged in Tarbela .
But news of the arrival of the notorious Blackwater mercenaries in addition to the thousand U.S. marines are riveting their attention .
In Pakistan , Blackwater is trading its tainted name for a telling name " Xe Worldwide " , - the name behind which these paid killers are now hiding .
Also , last week , Creative Associates International Inc ( CAII ) , a CIA front , has been operating in Peshawar .
They have now sealed off a road and set up shop near the houses of senior Pakistani officials in Islamabad , directly across from a school .
Dr. Shireen Mazari Dr. Shireen M. Mazari is a scholar and commentator on Strategic Studies and Political Science from Pakistan .
She has a Ph.D. from Colombia University and was Director General of Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad , Pakistan and former Chairperson of Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at the Quaid - i- Azam University , Islamabad .
She is critical of the relationship the Pakistan government has with the United States and India .
Speaking for an opposition political party ( Tehreek - e - Insaaf ) , Dr. Shireen Mazari speaks about the new arrival of U.S. forces in Pakistan : " Will some of these go to the Pentagon 's assassination squads , who may take up residence in some of the barricaded Islamabad houses and with whom the present US commander in Afghanistan was directly associated ?
Ordinary officials at Pakistani airports have also been muttering their concerns over chartered flights flying in Americans whose entry is not recorded – even the flight crews are not checked for visas and so there is now no record - keeping of exactly how many Americans are coming into or going out of Pakistan .
Incidentally the CAII 's ( CIA / Blackwater ) Craig Davis who was deported has now returned to Peshawar !
And let us not be fooled by the cry that numbers reflect friendship since we know what numbers meant to Soviet satellites . "
The Pearl Continental , a luxury hotel in Peshawar was bombed on June 9 , 2009 .
The U.S. routinely blames these attacks on Muslim terrorists .
The U.S. has also routinely sabotaged peace agreements between the Pakistan government and various resistance groups in Pakistan .
Attacks like this are used to justify the current invasion and occupation by the United States .
Given little attention in the corporate media , Peshawar 's Pearl Continental Hotel was bombed on June 9 , 2009 .
At the time of the bombing , Pakistani media reported officially that it was housing U.S. personnel at the time but did not mention Blackwater .
However , Blackwater 's name began to surface in rumours and unofficial reports after the Peshawar bombing .
Ahmed Quraishi
On August 5 , 2009 , Ahmed Quraishi , political analyst , columnist and independent owner of a news website reported on the insertion of U.S. Marines , Blackwater , the CIA and military hardware into Pakistan : " Pakistanis ask , ' Who rules our streets , the Pakistani government or the Americans ?
And who let them in ? '
“ Three weeks ago a group of concerned Pakistani citizens in Peshawar wrote to the federal interior ministry to complain about the suspicious activities of a group of shadowy Americans in a rented house in their neighborhood , the upscale University Town area of Peshawar .
A NGO calling itself Creative Associates International , Inc. leased the house ” .
According to its Website , CAII describes itself as ' a privately - owned non-governmental organization that addresses urgent challenges facing societies today ...
Creative views change as an opportunity to improve , transform and renew …'
The description makes no sense .
It is more or less a perfect cover for the American NGO 's real work : espionage ...
“ In Peshawar , CAII , opened an office to work on projects in the nearby tribal agencies of Pakistan .
All of these projects , interestingly , are linked to the US government .
CAII 's other projects outside Pakistan are also linked to the US government .
In short , this NGO is not an NGO .
It is closely linked to the US government .
Meanwhile , when asked about the expansion of the embassy , U.S. Ambassador Anne W. Patterson was " visibly shaken " and replied , " I ’m speechless .
To spy on Pakistan we do n’t need a big US embassy . "
Quickly recovering , she added , " And we do n’t need to spy either . "
Patterson went on to say that Pakistan could turn into a " family station " - whatever that means to a U.S. colonial bureaucrat .
Ahmed further explains the CIA 's cover for the Blackwater mercenaries : " In Peshawar , CAII told Pakistani authorities it needed to hire security guards for protection .
The security guards , it turns out , were none other than Blackwater 's military - trained hired guns .
They were used the CAII cover to conduct a range of covert activities in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province .
The infamous Blackwater private security firm operates as an extension of the US military and CIA , taking care of dirty jobs that the US government cannot associate itself with in faraway strategic places .
Blackwater is anything but a security firm .
It is a mercenary army of several thousand hired soldiers .
" Pakistani security officials apparently became alarmed by reports that Blackwater was operating from the office of CAII on Chinar Road , University Town in Peshawar .
The man in charge of the office , allegedly an American by the name of Craig Davis according to a report in Jang , Pakistan 's largest Urdu language daily , was arrested and accused of establishing contacts with ' the enemies of Pakistan ' in areas adjoining Afghanistan .
His visa has been cancelled , the office sealed , and Mr. Davis reportedly expelled back to the United States .
" It is not clear when Mr. Davis was deported and whether there are other members of the staff expelled along with him .
When I contacted the US Embassy over the weekend , spokesman Richard Snelsire 's first reaction was , ' No embassy official has been deported ' . "
Keep in mind that Dr. Shireen Mazari who is in a position to know , stated flatly , " CAII 's Craig Davis who was deported has now returned to Peshawar ! "
But Ahmed Quraishi explains the denial by the U.S. embassy : " This defensive answer is similar to the guilt - induced reactions of US embassy staffers in Baghdad and Kabul at the presence of mercenaries working for US military and CIA .
I said to Mr. Snelsire that I did not ask about an embassy official being expelled .
He said he heard these reports and ' checked around ' with the embassy officials but no one knew about this .
' It 's baseless ' [ he said ] .
So I asked him , " Is Blackwater operating in Pakistan , in Peshawar ? "
' Not to my knowledge ' .
[ he answered ] .
" Fair enough .
The US embassies in Baghdad and Kabul never acknowledged Blackwater 's operations in Iraq and Afghanistan either .
This is part of low - level frictions between the diplomats at the US Department of State and those in Pentagon and CIA .
The people at State have reportedly made it clear they will not acknowledge or accept responsibility for the activities of special operations agents operating in friendly countries without the knowledge of those countries and in violation of their sovereignty .
Reports have suggested that sometimes even the US ambassador is unaware of what his government 's mercenaries do in a target country . "
Finally , Ahmed discusses a U.S. diplomat met secretly with an Indian diplomat inside Pakistan , knowing full well that India is considered to be an enemy state of Pakistan : “ In May , a US woman diplomat was caught arranging a quiet [ read ' secret ' ] meeting between a low - level Indian diplomat and several senior Pakistani government officials .
An address in Islamabad – 152 Margalla Road – was identified as a venue where the secret meeting took place .
The American diplomat in question knew there was no chance the Indian would get to meet the Pakistanis in normal circumstances .
Nor was it possible to do this during a high visibility event .
After the incident , Pakistan Foreign Office issued a terse statement warning all government officials to refrain from such direct contact with foreign diplomats in unofficial settings without prior intimation to their departments ” .
NGOs that are not NGOs
In addition , many U.S. sponsored NGO ’s are working to create news reports in mainstream media which are pro-U.S .
For this purpose , many Pakistani analysts , retired generals , businessmen , journalists , and academics are being recruited .
As Ahmed Quraishi said , " this NGO is not an NGO " , i.e. some Non Governmental Organizations operate under the control and direction of governments who use them for covert operations in foreign countries and fund them surreptitiously .
Conclusion
It ’s clear that the current government has given full privileges to the US .
They neither know how , nor want to draw a line against U.S. interference in Pakistani affairs .
To put it bluntly , they are surrendering the sovereignty of Pakistan to a foreign power .
Dr. Shireen Mazari says , " Whatever the US embassy gives out ... the terrified Pakistani leadership echoes . "
The objectives of the U.S. are clear : Deeper U.S. penetration will result in the destabilisation of Pakistan , leading to destabilization of the entire region .
These U.S. military installations also strengthening their encirclement of Iran .
The Pakistani political opposition parties are lip stuck at all these developments .
The main reason for their silence is that they are as corrupt as the ruling PPP .
No political party in Pakistan is in the mood to resist US hegemony .
The Pakistan Army no longer shows any interest in directly interfering with political decisions .
After the disastrous eight years under the military dictatorship of Musharraf , the people are also not ready for the Pakistan military to intervene in the political life of the country .
The TTP terrorists have just been brought under control - barely .
Now millions of Pakistanis are terrified by their new , unwelcome guests from the west - the U.S. terrorists .
We will now have to learn to tolerate and survive under this growing and increasingly dangerous U.S. colonization of Pakistan .

Dear God ,
Will you please take care of my dog ?
She died yesterday and is with you in heaven .
I miss her very much .
I am happy that you let me have her as my dog even though she got sick .
I hope you will play with her .
She likes to play with balls and to swim .
I am sending a picture of her so when you see her you will know that she is my dog .
I really miss her .
Love , Meredith .
We put the letter in an envelope with a picture of Abbey and Meredith and addressed it to God / Heaven .
We put our return address on it .
Then Meredith pasted several stamps on the front of the envelope because she said it would take lots of stamps to get the letter all the way to heaven .
That afternoon she dropped it into the letter box at the post office .
A few days later , she asked if God had gotten the letter yet .
I told her that I thought He had .
Yesterday , there was a package wrapped in gold paper on our front porch addressed , ' To Meredith ' in an unfamiliar hand .
Meredith opened it .
Inside was a book by Mr. Rogers called , ' When a Pet Dies . '
Taped to the inside front cover was the letter we had written to God in its opened envelope .
On the opposite page was the picture of Abbey & Meredith and this note : Dear Meredith , Abbey arrived safely in heaven .
Having the picture was a big help .
I recognized Abbey right away .
Abbey is n't sick anymore .
Her spirit is here with me just like it stays in your heart .
Abbey loved being your dog .
Since we do n't need our bodies in heaven , I do n't have any pockets to keep your picture in , so I am sending it back to you in this little book for you to keep and have something to remember Abbey by .
Thank you for the beautiful letter and thank your mother for helping you write it and sending it to me .
What a wonderful mother you have .
I picked her especially for you .
I send my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much .
By the way , I am wherever there is love .
Love , God
Apologies to the everpresent Fox Trot .
Hey , I hope everyone had a great weekend !
I know we did .
Fun with fire and sparklers , yay America , all that .
So remember back in Dungeons and Dragons ( advanced , sorry , 3rd edition ) , you 'd go around and wander through the eponymous dungeons ?
Every time you entered a new room it was always one person 's job to unceremoniously declare their intent to loot and plunder .
So much so that the " wizards " within these dungeons had to start making treasure chests and rugs that were actually just evil monsters , because hey why not .
I remember they busted up a drug house in the county next to ours a while ago .
There was a mention of " traps " involved , but they were n't specific .
My assumption is floating somewhere between a precarious shotgun / twine affair pointed at the door and , perhaps , an owlbear hidding behind a sliding stone wall , activated by the presence of lawful goodness .

NASA 's Chandra - Designed for Five Year Mission , Still Going Strong at Ten
Ten years ago , on July 23 , 1999 , NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched aboard the space shuttle Columbia and deployed into orbit .
Chandra has doubled its original five - year mission , ushering in an unprecedented decade of discovery for the high - energy universe .
With its unrivaled ability to create high - resolution X- ray images , Chandra has enabled astronomers to investigate phenomena as diverse as comets , black holes , dark matter and dark energy .
" Chandra 's discoveries are truly astonishing and have made dramatic changes to our understanding of the universe and its constituents , " said Martin Weisskopf , Chandra project scientist at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
The science that has been generated by Chandra -- both on its own and in conjunction with other telescopes in space and on the ground -- has had a widespread , transformative impact on 21st century astrophysics .
Chandra has provided the strongest evidence yet that dark matter must exist .
It has independently confirmed the existence of dark energy and made spectacular images of titanic explosions produced by matter swirling toward supermassive black holes .
To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Chandra , three new versions of classic Chandra images will be released during the next three months .
These images , the first of which is available Thursday , provide new data and a more complete view of objects that Chandra observed in earlier stages of its mission .
The image being released today is of E0102 - 72 , the spectacular remains of an exploded star .
" The Great Observatories program -- of which Chandra is a major part -- shows how astronomers need as many tools as possible to tackle the big questions out there , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
NASA 's other " Great Observatories " are the Hubble Space Telescope , Compton Gamma - Ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope .
The next image will be released in August to highlight the anniversary of when Chandra opened up for the first time and gathered light on its detectors .
The third image will be released during " Chandra 's First Decade of Discovery " symposium in Boston , which begins Sept. 22 .
" I am extremely proud of the tremendous team of people who worked so hard to make Chandra a success , " said Harvey Tananbaum , director of the Chandra X-ray Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge , Mass .
" It has taken partners at NASA , industry and academia to make Chandra the crown jewel of high - energy astrophysics . "
Tananbaum and Nobel Prize winner Riccardo Giacconi originally proposed Chandra to NASA in 1976 .
Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope , Chandra is in a highly elliptical orbit that takes it almost one third of the way to the moon , and was not designed to be serviced after it was deployed .

Intel will focus on its next generation of smaller and faster chips at a conference next month as it prepares to ship new chips for systems in 2010 .
Intel plans to shed more light on the Westmere architecture at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) , which will be held Sept. 22 - 24 in San Francisco .
The company is expected to talk about the architecture behind its future chips for servers , laptops and desktops .
Chips based on Westmere will be made using the advanced 32 - nanometer process and should deliver performance and power benefits over existing Intel chips made using the 45 - nm process .
Initial chips will integrate a CPU and graphics processor in a single package , which could improve graphics performance while drawing less power .
A server zone at IDF will focus on the Westmere - EP platform , where performance of server chips based on the new architecture will be highlighted .
The company is expected to talk about many chip features , including security capabilities , and could show off systems at the show .
The first Westmere chips will go into laptops and desktops as early as the first half of 2010 .
Initial Westmere chips will be dual - core CPUs with 4MB of cache , and will include an integrated memory controller .
Clock speeds could remain similar to existing processors , but performance could see a boost by running two threads on each core , Intel officials have said .
Initial Westmere - based laptop chips , code - named Arrandale , could preserve battery life while improving graphics performance .
The desktop chips are code - named Clarkdale .
The chips are expected to go into production in the fourth quarter this year , though samples have already shipped to laptop and desktop PC makers for testing .
The Westmere architecture is the basis of some of Intel 's future laptop and desktop chips , including the Core i3 , i5 and 7 chips , wrote Ken Kaplan in a blog entry on Intel 's Web site on Wednesday .
The chip package 's CPU will be made using the advanced 32 - nanometer manufacturing process .
The graphics processor will be made using the 45 - nm process .
Westmere is a process shrink of Intel 's current Nehalem microarchitecture , which forms the basis of the existing Core i7 high - end desktop and Xeon 5500 server chips .
Nehalem integrates a memory controller with the CPU and provides a fast pipeline for processors and system components to communicate .
Nehalem was a big architectural shift as it was Intel 's first microprocessor with an integrated memory controller , said Dean McCarron , principal analyst at Mercury Research .
But early systems based on Nehalem were expensive with prices above $ 1,000 .
" Westmere is going to let the [ Nehalem ] architecture be much more broadly used , " McCarron said .
The process shrink lowers the cost of production for Intel , which could help push the chip design to inexpensive systems , he said .
Intel revamped its chip road map in February , saying it would move to a 32 - nanometer process more quickly than it had originally planned .
The company would spend $ 7 billion over the next two years to revamp manufacturing plants in order to reduce manufacturing costs while increasing production .
Intel may also focus on the Larrabee chip during the show , McCarron said .
Larrabee will include many cores and combine processing capabilities of graphics processing units with the x86 architecture , improving application and graphics performance .
The chip -- being called a graphics processor -- is targeted at the gaming market and industries that require high - end parallel processing and graphics power , like oil and gas exploration ..
" This will probably be the last IDF till Larrabee launches , " McCarron said .
Intel has said it would ship Larrabee in early 2010 .
Laxmi has come to terms with her reality
Eastern India 's most prominent mental health institute , in the city of Ranchi , has recently published a list of 98 patients " abandoned " by their families .
They were brought here for treatment and even though they are now stable , they are languishing because their families refuse to take them .
The BBC's Geeta Pandey reports .
A group of women stand in a hall , praying : " God , give us strength , to conquer our minds .
Before we conquer others , let us conquer ourselves . "
Among the women is Laxmi Jaiswal .
Her advanced age is etched in the lines of her face .
" I 've been here a very long time , at least 20 years , " she tells me .
Hospital records show that it is even longer than that - 23 years and two months .
In the years that Laxmi has been incarcerated , she has not had a single visitor .
She was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia .
After she stabilised , several letters were sent to her address , but there has been no response from the family .
She does n't discuss her life with other inmates .
" I keep it buried in my heart .
If I were to tell anyone , will they be able to return me my family ? " she asks .
Gently nudged by Sister Celine , the supervisor of the hospital 's female ward , she pours out her heart to me .
" My brother - in - law brought me here .
He did n't get along with my husband .
I had children , whereas he did n't have any .
He did n't like that .
He snatched my children from me , and dumped me in this madhouse .
My husband did not intervene , " she says .
' No idea ' Laxmi has spent a better part of her life in the institute , forgotten by her family and the outside world .
" We had a large farm in Bihar and my husband used to sell tobacco .
I have no idea where he is now or why he never came to see me .
He must have taken a second wife , or maybe a third one . "
Laxmi is mother to five boys and six girls .
" They must be all grown up now .
I miss them , " she says , tears clouding her eyes .
Sister Celine is the supervisor in the female ward Although abandoned by her family , Laxmi is yet to abandon hope .
Recently , she told the hospital staff that one of her sons was living in Ranchi's Upper Bazar area .
" It 's a very congested area , we spent an entire day there , but the patient was unable to identify the house .
She named a pond , then a market , then a by - lane , but we could n't trace her home , " Sister Celine says .
" She 's an old woman , she 's been here far too long .
It can happen to us .
Even if you or I go somewhere after a long time , we may not be able to recognise the place , " she says .
In this 500 - bed hospital , Laxmi is among the 98 people on the list of abandoned patients .
Clinical psychologist at the hospital Amul Ranjan Singh says the reason why families reject a patient is because in India there is a stigma attached to mental illness .
' Myth '
Most people believe that once a person develops a mental illness , he or she can never be cured .
" There 's a myth that a mental health patient cannot do day - to - day activities or earn a livelihood .
And a majority of our patients come from poor families who believe that these people wo n't be productive economically . "

In pictures
Hospital staff say some patients are found wandering on the streets and are brought in by the police and there are no records of where they came from .
Then , it all depends on what the patient remembers once he or she is stable .
Sometimes , they are able to remember and give their details , but sometimes memory lapses result in mistakes .
" Sometimes the families refuse , outright , to take the patient back .
How do we tell a family that the patient is theirs if they refuse ? "
Sister Celine asks .
' Denial '
For the patients though , coping with rejection can be a very painful affair .
" They go into denial , " says Dr Singh .
" And there are two ways of denial - either they deny the existence of their family , or they deny their attitude towards them .
" Specially the female patients never forget and they keep expecting that somebody will come for them .
Males easily agree that probably there 's nobody around who will come , and they say , I do n't want to go back home .
Dr Singh says patients should be gently rehabilitated into society " Sometimes after a few months , you find the same patient roaming in front of the institute .
Their families come and leave them here .
This is pathetic .
We take them back in and try to give them a life of dignity here , " he says .
The hospital 's sprawling campus is divided into separate male and female wards - 150 places are reserved for women and the number of male patients is 350 .
The male ward has nearly three dozen " abandoned " patients .
Here I meet Budhwa Munda , weaving cloth on a loom .
He 's 62 and has spent 36 years in the hospital .
" He has grown old here , " says caretaker Jehangir .
Budhwa was brought to the hospital in 1973 by the police and letters sent to the authorities have gone unanswered .
Budhwa does n't talk at all , he speaks only with gestures if he needs anything , and Jehangir says they have no idea about his family .
' Take me home ' Working on the loom alongside Budhwa is Ramji .
He was brought to the hospital by his family when he was a boy .
" When he came here , he had no facial hair .
Today , he 's greying , so you can make out how long he 's been here , " says Jehangir .
At the time of his admission , his family wrote down a false address and no one has ever come to see him .
Letters sent to the address have all come back .
" Please take me home , " Ramji appeals to me as soon as he sees me .
" Send someone with me who will take me by the hand and put me on a bus .
He can drop me home and come back .
I 'll return a year later . "
I 'm perhaps the only visitor Ramji has had in a long time .
Or maybe ever .
He follows me around as I move on to speak to others .
His desperation , and the hope in his eyes , is gut wrenching .
For these abandoned men and women here , home 's a far away place , a chimera , a mirage .
And it will perhaps remain out of reach for most of them , forever .
Laxmi , however , seems to have come to terms with her reality .
" Since this is the place I have been mandated to live in , I will live here till the day I die .
After that I will meet my maker . "

Australian economist Steve Keen is one of the very few who have called this economic crisis correctly .
What distinguishes Keen is that his economic forecasts are based on levels of debt and changes in levels of debt as opposed to money supply , output capacity and other things that led most economists astray .
The following video is about 19 minutes long but very much worth listening to in entirety , improving as it goes along .
The video may take a while to load but it 's well worth it .
Everything below in quotes , until the next bold title is a partial transcript from the video .
Steve Keen :
" If you have a sane economy , and by sane economy I mean one which is not addicted to debt , not a Ponzi economy , then the change in debt each year should contribute a minor amount to demand .
Therefore , if you tried to correlate debt to the level of unemployment you would not find much of a correlation .
Unfortunately that is not the economy we live in . "
" The red line shows the percent contribution that debt contributes to demand and the blue line which is inverted is the unemployment rate . "
" There should be no correlation if the economy is operating sensibly .
Correlation is now at the level of 83 % .
Because we have a debt driven economy , the change in debt levels each year is the major determinant in the change in economic performance . "
" Neoclassical economic theory is dangerous .
Neoclassical economists completely missed this crisis .
My favorite statement comes from the OECD in its June 2007 report "
" A recent survey trying to find economists who predicted this found 12 .
And there are 10,000 - 15,000 economists in the US alone which is why I do n't particularly accept their assurances that everything is OK from now on . "
" Now why are economists so ignorant ?
Two major reasons .
First of all the type of modeling they do is static where you ignore time , or if you have dynamics you assume they are converging to some nice stable situation in the future .
And they ignore almost completely the role of credit and debt . "
" I probably win the Dr. Doom award around the planet these days now that Nouriel Roubini is expecting the recession will end in about 6 months time .
I think it 's got a lot longer to go than that . "
" What we are going through is a deleveraging crisis and we have n't experienced one of those since 1930 .
Last time it took 10 years and a world war to get rid of it , and this time we are staring up with 1.7 times the level of debt in America , not even mentioning the derivatives catastrophe that is also there . "
" And deleveraging which is the attempt by the private sector to reduce its debt level can overwhelm the government 's stimulus .
The whole problem was caused by irresponsible lending and the only way out of this ultimately is to eliminate that debt .
The debt has to be written off "
Powerpoint Presentation
The above text is a partial transcript from his presentation and the slides are two of many slides from the accompanying Powerpoint presentation .
You can download the presentation on Steve Keen ’s Debtwatch Blog .
You will need to listen to the video to understand some of the slides .
Australian readers will want to pay particular attention as Australia is certainly not out of the woods .
Keen 's Proposed Solutions
Steve Keen has some interesting proposals for solutions .
He spoke of nationalizing banks which I have sided against .
However , Keen also wanted to wipe out the shareholders and repudiate the bondholders by turning the assets over to the bondholders in a bankruptcy process .
That is something I certainly do agree with .
The problem here is probably the word " nationalization "
One thing is certain , US taxpayers got the worst of all worlds by nationalizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and taking over the liabilities ( at taxpayer expense ) while making the bondholders whole .
To top off the madness , Fannie and Freddie increased lending limits , putting taxpayers at further risk .
This is exactly the wrong " nationalization " approach and I am sure Keen would agree .
Keen has an interesting idea that mortgages on houses ought to be based on what rent they could fetch .
Clearly the credit bubble never would have escalated to the point it did if lenders had the common sense to lend based on how much rent a house could fetch .
As it was , debt upon debt upon debt piled up until we had the Collapse Of The " Ownership Society " .
Supposedly no one saw this coming .
A chart in the preceding link proves otherwise .
Fed and Fractional Reserve Lending at Heart of the Issue
In regards to Keen 's solutions , I believe the free market should make these decisions , not government bureaucrats .
And in that regard , Keen never touched on what I think are the two root causes of this mess :
1 ) Micro-mismanagement of interest rates by central bankers in general and the Fed in particular .
2 ) Fractional reserve lending gone mad .
Free Market Forces Should Decide
It was not lack of regulation that got us into this mess , but rather regulation , going back to 1913 and the creation of the Fed .
Making matters worse , Congress authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and hundreds of " affordable housing " programs all designed to pressure people into buying houses .
Let 's not forget the misguided regulation that created FDIC .
Inquiring mind will want to consider As of Friday August 14 , 2009 , FDIC is Bankrupt and followup Emails from a Bank Owner regarding FDIC and Under - Capitalized Banks .
If we eliminate FDIC , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and all the housing subsidies authorized by Congress and the states , then the free market may very well decide that Keen 's model of pricing houses is the correct one .
As it sits , there are too many factors other than rent that affect home prices , such as federal income tax deductions , affordable housing programs , proposition 13 in California , Fannie and Freddie , etc .
Attempting to control those forces with more regulation is the wrong way to go .
However , there is no reason why banks could not and should not ( on their own accord ) start making lending decisions based on rental values .
When it comes to the writeoff of debt and the need to prevent another debt bubble , I certainly side with Keen vs. Krugman , Mankiw , and even Roubini who all prescribe variations of " Neoclassical Nonsense " hoping to spur more bank lending and consumer borrowing by throwing money at the problem .
My own theory on credit and debt is contained in Fiat World Mathematical Model .
Thanks go to Steve Keen for helping me finalize that model .
I have some emails from Steve Keen regarding my model , Keynesian clowns , and other things .
I will share some of those emails later this week .

An illegal immigrant was still on the run last night after smuggling himself into the UK - under a bus carrying at least 20 immigration officers .
Uk Border Agency officials who were returning from Calais through the Channel Tunnel failed to spot the man as he clung to the underside of the coach , just inches from its wheels .
When the coach arrived at its depot in Folkestone , Kent , the driver spotted the man and gave chase , but the stowaway escaped .
An investigation has now been launched into the breach of security .
Tory MP Philip Davies said : " It would be laughable if it was n't so serious .
It highlights what a shambles our border controls have become . "
In one of Dr. Calhoun 's experiments , a square steel box , nine feet on each side , contained 2,600 mice , about 16 times what would be considered normal density .
He determined that rodents rapidly developed a hierarchy when thrown together in such huge numbers , with those closest to the food supply growing most rapidly and , because of their size , assuming higher social status .
Dr. Calhoun was born in Elkton , Tenn. , and received a bachelor 's degree from the University of Virginia in 1939 and a doctorate in zoology from Northwestern University in 1943 .
After studies on Norway rats at Johns Hopkins University , and on mice at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory in Bar Harbor , Me. , he joined the mental health institute in 1954 .
In 1963 , he organized the unit for research on behavioral systems at the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior , a division of the N.I.M.H.
He continued as chief of the unit until his retirement in 1986 .
His work was the inspiration for a children 's book by Robert C. O'Brien , " Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH " which became the basis for a popular animated film , " The Secret of NIMH , " released in 1982 .
Dr. Calhoun was a cheerful man who maintained a sense of humor about his work and the stereotypical image of scientists studying rats in mazes , Mrs. Kerr said .
But his work had its frustrations as well , she noted , because its implications for the future of the human rat race were often met with studied disregard .
we ’ve gone totally crazy for the grill here in our new place .
you know that feeling , on the very last day of school , when you know you ’re done for the year , and you ’ve got a whole summer of doing whatever you want ahead of you ?
having a grill makes every day feel like that .
there ’s nothing more relaxing than lounging in the backyard and cooking up hot dogs and hamburgers , or something a bit more sophisticated , like pizza ( that ’s right , i’m calling pizza sophisticated ) .
it ’s a little nerve racking throwing pizza dough right on the grill for the first time .
i was sure it would fall through the grate , but sure enough , it cooked right up perfectly .
the charcoal gives the dough a smokiness you do n’t get from a conventional oven , plus the perfect combination of a crispy crust with a soft chewy interior .
here ’s an extremely rare shot of me actually cooking .
and readers , meet the girl .
ai n’t she sweet ?
sorry , no pictures of us together – it was just the two of us , so we had to take shots of each other .
she ’s a amazing cook and i’m an extremely lucky dude to have her .
look at those grill marks .
this crust is about to be topped and tossed back on the grill to finish cooking .
here ’s the girl adding a bit of sauce with fresh basil .
as you can see , i’m not a master at making a perfectly round pizza .
we ’ll just call it “ rustic . ” this one was topped with barbecue chicken , caramelized onions , mozzarella and more fresh basil .
if you ’ve never grilled pizza before , or even ever made pizza at home before , it ’s actually easier than it looks .
have all of your friends over , tell them to bring their favorite toppings , and just keep cooking them up until everyone is too full to move .
it does n’t hurt to have a few glasses of wine to make the meal complete .
here ’s the grilled chicken we added to the pizzas .
we ’ve been in our new place for 3 weeks , and this is the second time we ’ve made this chicken .
the girl whipped up a really incredible bbq sauce that caramelizes perfectly and makes the chicken tangy and hot .
hmmm…sausage , caramelized onions , local fresh ricotta , and swiss chard .
this one got a helping of mozzarella once it hit the grill a second time .
these were so much fun to make ( and incredibly delicious ) , i might do it again this week .
one last thing – the kind folks at washingtonian.com were nice enough to do a little interview with me for their “ blogger beat ” section , which you can read here .
it was totally humbling to get to do it , so i hope you enjoy it .
i think i successfully came off looking like a total dork ( totally my intention all along ) .
big thanks to washingtonian.com and thanks to all of you for continuing to read this blog and just being generally awesome .
Using Opacity to Show Focus with jQuery
A few days back I debuted a sweet article that made use of MooTools JavaScript and opacity to show focus on a specified element .
Here 's how to accomplish that feat using jQuery .
The jQuery JavaScript
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { //area 1 $ ( '.fade -area-1') .children ( ) .hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .siblings ( ) .stop ( ).fadeTo( 500,0.5 ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .siblings ( ) .stop ( ) .fadeTo( 500,1 ) ; } ) ; //area 2 $ ( '.fade -area-2') .children ( ) .hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .siblings ( ) .stop ( ).fadeTo( 500,0.5 ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .siblings ( ) .stop ( ) .fadeTo( 500,1 ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
There you have it .
Opacity is a very simple but effective tool for building an attractive interface .
Publishers claim that their rejections are not necessarily based on value judgments .
They may like a manuscript , they say , but be unable to publish it because of prior commitments or scheduling jams , lack of money or other operational obstacles .
They have let some amazingly big fish slip through their nets , great classics and ultimate blockbusters of all varieties : War and Peace , The Good Earth … To Kill a Mockingbird , The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayam , Watership Down .
An agent once told me that a publisher passed on The Perfect Storm .
The acquisition editor ’s reason was “ Who would want to read about a bunch of fisherman . ”
I suppose Peter Benchley ’s book , Jaws , was passed over by some agents and publishers because it was just a fish story .
The list goes on and on .
Here are some examples of famous author rejection letters .
Lady Chatterley ’s Lover by D H Lawrence
‘ for your own sake do not publish this book . ’
Lord of the Flies by William Golding
‘ an absurd and uninteresting fantasy which was rubbish and dull . ’
The Diary of Anne Frank
‘ The girl does n’t , it seems to me , have a special perception or feeling which would lift that book above the “ curiosity ” level . ’
Carrie by Stephen King
‘ We are not interested in science fiction which deals with negative utopias .
They do not sell . ’
Catch – 22 by Joseph Heller
‘ I have n’t really the foggiest idea about what the man is trying to say …
Apparently the author intends it to be funny – possibly even satire – but it is really not funny on any intellectual level …
From your long publishing experience you will know that it is less disastrous to turn down a work of genius than to turn down talented mediocrities . ’
Animal Farm by George Orwell
‘ It is impossible to sell animal stories in the USA ’
Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov
‘… overwhelmingly nauseating , even to an enlightened Freudian … the whole thing is an unsure cross between hideous reality and improbable fantasy .
It often becomes a wild neurotic daydream … I recommend that it be buried under a stone for a thousand years . ’
Watership Down by Richard Adams
‘ older children would n’t like it because its language was too difficult . ’
The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame

Q : My husband has cheated on me many , many times .
I do n’t think he ’ll ever stop .
I know I should leave him , but I can ’t .
I still love him !
There is no one else I ’d rather be with !
So I ’m wondering : will he ever stop cheating ?
Am I just wasting my time ?
How can I mend my broken marriage ?
— Please Make Him Stop
Dear Please Make Him Stop ,
There ’s one thing I can say about my husband with great certainty .
He ’s not a cheater .
I ’ve never once caught him checking out another woman .
He does n’t have female friends .
He does n’t flirt .
It ’s just not in his DNA .
Because of this , I found your question very tough to answer .
Will your husband ever stop cheating ?
Perhaps , but probably only if you Bobbit him .
( Please know that I am not suggesting this as a remedy to your problem . )
But what do I know ?
Really .
This is out of my area of experience .
For a credible opinion on the matter , I turned to a friend who was once in your exact situation .
Her first husband cheated on her repeatedly .
She was a stay at home mom who raised three kids .
He was a dad who wanted to do it with any woman but his wife .
I sent her your question .
Here ’s her advice :
You ’ve already answered some of your own questions .
You say , “ He ’s cheated on me numerous times . ”
You say , “ I do n’t think he ’ll ever stop . ”
Go with your gut .
You already know that staying with your husband any longer is just a waste of precious time .
You deserve better treatment , a better relationship , and a better life .
Your children will respect you more and have a better self esteem if they see that you will not allow yourself to be made unhappy and abused .
Emotional abuse is just as damaging as physical abuse .
He is choosing to cheat on you .
You might think this is about the other woman , that they hold some power over him .
It ’s not about the women , though .
It ’s about him .
He ’s choosing not to exert self control .
You say you love him .
Can you love him with the cheating part of his personality ?
Because that ’s who he is .
My first husband had the same personality issues .
At first , I was like you .
I thought I could mend my marriage , I thought I could change myself so that he would n’t think these other women were so great .
I have 3 kids , grown now , and I did n’t want my family to break up .
I did n’t want to lose my dreams about the future that I had envisioned .
But , after too long of a time I finally became so disgusted that I realized that anything would be better than living with a cheating , lying husband .
I wanted my peace of mind back .
I wanted my children to live in a peaceful atmosphere .
I have never regretted filing for divorce .
I do regret taking so long to do it .
See ?
She ’s great .
I think her advice is right on the money .
The only thing I would add is this .
I think your main problem is a lack of self esteem and self worth .
You do n’t realize that you deserve better .
The day you realize that ?
You will become a powerful woman .
Do you have any advice for Please Make Him Stop ?

Man can only be perceived as having one of three relationship with nature .
Man is either a being that :
A . Is one - and - the - same with nature .
B. Originated from nature , but then at some point in its evolution transcended it .
C. Is , and always has been , entirely distinct from nature .
Traditional religions like Christianity ( which is the only one I can truly speak for since I grew up in a Roman Catholic household ) seem to favor option C .
In the Bible , man is the only being that is said to have been created in the image of God.
Buddhism too distinguishes between “ Animal Realms ” and “ Human Realms ” of existence , although it is n’t necessarily true that they are entirely distinct entities ( due to the Buddha ’s teachings on karma , past lives , and interconnectedness ) .
But modern intellectual and scientific thought suggests that we all originated from the same primordial soup .
We were n’t created in the image of God , all living things have the same origins , and we evolved from there into what we are now .
One thing is certain however : most people today perceive man as being distinct from nature .
Our proof ?
Rational thinking , civilization , and technology .
Especially today – when one can spend a whole life ’s existence never stepping foot inside a natural park – we sometimes forget nature even exists .
Instead it becomes a distant dream ; something we only see in the movies .
Perhaps over the years there has even grown a subconscious desire of man to reunite with nature .
But wait – why do we feel so distant and distinct from nature to begin with ?
Are we not still nature ?
Now when man creates we call these things “ synthesized ” or “ artificial . ”
But how can the hands of man – these hands that were in themselves built by nature – go on to create things no longer natural ?
How can the products of our minds – these brains that too are built by nature – go on to generate unnatural ideas ?
If man and nature share the same origins than any distinction between the two at a later point in time must be completely unfounded or completely arbitrary .
At what point exactly did man transcend nature ?
Is there even such a thing as a “ nature ” for man to transcend ?
Or did man wake up one day , look outside the window , see nothing but tall skyscrapers and think : this is not the nature they told me about in biology class .
How can I be a part of this and still be a part of nature ?
Perhaps there is a dualistic nature to man ?
Perhaps we can think of ourselves as only products of nature , but anything that is a product of us ( excluding of course : reproduction , digestive waste , etc. ) is “ technology , ” or whatever we want to call this not - nature state of being .
But even so – then why must technology be inherently distinct from nature ?
Did it not too come from natural things in our environment ?
It is not like scientists are poking their heads in and out of parallel universes and discovering un-natural or super - natural things .
Are they ?!
The choice to make a distinction between man and nature is ultimately up to you .
No answer seems inherently right or wrong – perhaps it is only convenient in some cases to say man is different , and then not so much in other times .
But if you had to choose one what would it be :
1 . Are we God ’s blessed creatures that were made distinct from nature ?
2 . Are we products of nature but since have transcended nature ? •
If so , at what point did this process begin , and
• What do we call this state of “ not - natural ” being ?
3 . Or , will we always be one with nature and the distinction is ultimately a delusion ?
Can I say I like all three possibilities … or would that be cheating ?
A British woman has been fined £ 86 ( $ 170 ) by crematorium officials for spending too long at the side of her dead five - week - old son .
British media reported on Tuesday that Terrie Rouse incurred the penalty after spending an extra 10 minutes with her son , Zane , before he was taken to be cremated in the town of Milton Keynes .
The town is about 105 kilometres north - west of London .
Milton Keynes Council said it routinely charged extra to those who overran the half hour devoted to each funeral but that it refunded the money to Ms Rouse due to " extenuating circumstances " .
The newspaper said the funeral took place on July 17 .
Zane died of sudden infant death syndrome , the BBC reported .

These flowers come right out of the plant ’s base increasing the beauty of the houseplant .
The flowers have a soft leathery feel when touched .
This beautiful flower bearing houseplant is very much easier to grow .
The blooms grow fantastically under moderate to low light intensity .
This houseplant needs significantly moist soil to grow on .
If you are an ardent nail polish user , then you must be aware of the effects caused by that smell .
The nail polishes , paints , other solvents and adhesives contain harmful pollutants like benzene , toluene and xylene .
These pollutants are successfully filtered out in the ambience of your house by the beautiful Peace lily houseplant .
To prevent sun burn , you must place the peace lilies away from the direct sunlight .
Buying any of the above top 10 houseplants would ensure that the ambience of your house remains pure and fresh .
Apple ’s removal of Google Voice apps last week prompted 2 high - profile individuals to publicly renounce iPhone ownership .
First , Mac software developer Steven Frank was so furious with the removal that he decided to switch to a Palm Pre.
Second , TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington was equally pissed , so he penned a post titled “ I Quit The iPhone ” and announced that he’d be switching to an Android phone .
Are these guys for real ?
Now the iTunes App Store admittedly has had its fair share of speed - bumps , but if you get rid of the iPhone because Apple removed Google Voice , it makes me wonder why you even had an iPhone to begin with ?
Is 1 application so crucial to your existence that without it you ’re inclined to switch phones ?
Or are you taking a stand against Apple ’s somewhat convoluted and ambiguous app store approval process ?
Either way , who gives a shit ?
It ’s somewhat mind boggling how people can be so self - righteous as to think that they ’re sticking it to the man by moving on from the iPhone over the removal of a single app in a sea of 65,000 .
It ’d be one thing if people absolutely and unequivocally needed Google Voice , but come on , iPhone users have been happily going about their business without it for 2 years now .
And yes , AT&T blows , but if you ’re stuck in an area with shitty coverage , would n’t you have switched by now ?
Frank writes in his article ,
Was Apple behind the rejection ?
AT&T ?
Who cares ?
Well , as of now , it appears that AT&T was behind the removal and despite what Frank writes , it does make a difference .
The iPhone does n’t live in a vacuum .
It ’s a product that relies on AT&T providing acceptable cell - phone coverage , a responsibility that they have n’t quite lived up to .
But for whatever reason , people are so quick to disparage Apple that they admittedly concede that it does n’t even matter to them if Apple was behind the removal of Google Voice apps .
Tech
Dirt hits the nail on the head when it writes that many of these holier - than - thou individuals who dump the iPhone in an ill - conceived attempt at protest are failing to see what the iPhone actually is .
So why do so many criticize the iPhone , if it ’s so great ?
I think it ’s because they make the classic marketing mistake of thinking “ It ’s all about ME . ”
It is n’t .
The iPhone haters see the limitations ( hard keys , cut / paste , tethering … ) of the phone , and they focus on how the phone does n’t have any tech breakthrough or meet THEIR specific needs .
But the mass market is what really matters in business .
Is the mass market even aware of the limitations of their iPhone ?
If you told one of them , would they care ?
They would tell you that , on the contrary , their iPhone has not limited them , it has empowered them to access the mobile services and networks that have been “ available ” since 2000 , but were blocked by poor user experiences and walled gardens .
First they came for the iPhone , then they came for the BlackBerry ..
Frank correctly points out that Google Voice is available on a number of BlackBerry devices .
But is there any doubt that if BlackBerry users started using the app en masses that AT&T would force RIM to remove the app as well ?
Frank writes ,
But forget developers .
You , the consumer , are getting screwed too .
You are missing out on some great software that ’s available on other phones on the same network , without issue , for no apparent logical reason .
I disagree .
What great software are users missing out on ..
SlingPlayer ?
NetShare ?
I think I ’ll be able to survive without them no matter how cool they might be .
And the reason they ’re not there is because of AT&T .
I mean , tethering is already supported in a number of overseas markets , so how can you blame Apple ’s approval process for hindering tethering apps here in the US ?
I ’m not trying to argue that the app store is perfect as it of course has a number of kinks , but overall it ’s a great place for consumers to purchase great apps .
Many , if not most , of the app store removals have either been because of tasteless content or at the behest of AT&T .
Frank also writes ,
But at least my conscience is clear .
I hope change is coming .
I ’m really going to miss my iPhone terribly .
Oh come on , that ’s just being a tad over - dramatic , do n’t ya think ?
And if he ’s really going to miss it , then why bother switching at all ?
And quite comically , he notes that he ’s going to switch over to a Palm Pre , a platform that does n’t even have a Google Voice app available .
And he then writes that “ Sprint ’s coverage sucks in my neighborhood . ”
Seriously ?!
Well at least his conscience is clear , whatever that ’s supposed to mean .
2 years ago , iPhone owners were clamoring for third party apps .
Now there are well over 65,000 of them , but people are still bitching because not everything is up to their liking .
Well to them I say , “ Get over yourselves . ”
Of all the crap the U.S. Government spends money on , the National Endowment of the Arts is probably one of the least offensive .
When someone comes around and calls for eliminating funding for it , they come across often as either petty or too easily offended .
Two main complaints rear their head when the subject of the NEA comes up 1 ) it ’s a waste of taxpayer money and 2 ) OMG look at what they ’re funding !!!!
Well # 2 has never really moved me .
Frankly if you have that kind of arts funding , I ’m for having expression as free as possible .
( Besides if your art actually had popular support you would n’t need government money , right ? )
And # 1 ?
There are a hella lot more wasteful segments of the government to spend energy attacking .
Problem is there ’s a number three .
3 ) Anything funded by the State is eventually manipulated by the State to support the State ’s own ends .
But Mr. Swann , it ’s just paranoid to think that anyone would try and use the National Endowment for the Arts to try and manipulate their beneficiaries to become mouthpieces for some partisan political agenda .
Shall I quote from a blog post by Patrick Courrielche ?
On Thursday August 6th , I was invited by the National Endowment for the Arts to attend a conference call scheduled for Monday August 10th hosted by the NEA , the White House Office of Public Engagement , and United We Serve .
The call would include “ a group of artists , producers , promoters , organizers , influencers , marketers , taste - makers , leaders or just plain cool people to join together and work together to promote a more civically engaged America and celebrate how the arts can be used for a positive change ! ” [… ]
Backed by the full weight of President Barack Obama ’s call to service and the institutional weight of the NEA , the conference call was billed as an opportunity for those in the art community to inspire service in four key categories , and at the top of the list were “ health care ” and “ energy and environment . ” [ … ]
Obama has a strong arts agenda , we were told , and has been very supportive of both using and supporting the arts in creative ways to talk about the issues facing the country .
We were “ selected for a reason , ” they told us .
We had played a key role in the election and now Obama was putting out the call of service to help create change .
We knew “ how to make a stink , ” and were encouraged to do so .
Is n’t it nice to know that political ideology is now explicitly part of the mix ?
Frankly , if you ’re in the arts , of whatever political persuasion , this should really freak you out .
Defining politically acceptable modes of artistic expression has never been a sign of a healthy regime .
“ Have you met my friend ? ” A question asked too often at malls in the Midwest yet now , it carries a totally different meaning in the post - Facebook world .
Muslim and Christian Evangelist of all shades and colors , who includes you : early Sunday morning door - knocking Jehovah ’s witness , have been making our life more colorful by stopping the normal flow of our lives at malls , schools , and even at our own home with attempts to salvage our souls .
Now they have gone digital and with a zeal .
The Holy Book in my right and a mouse in the left ?
The mating of religion and social media seems like a perfect match but is it ?
Let me extrapolate ; Evangelists are always striving to save as many people as they can , why else would they go to the depth of the Amazon spending decades trying to convert some reclusive tribe .
Therefore , tools that enable them to reach a wider audience would surely be of an interest to them .
The internet is one of those tools , and social media is definitely where the people are at .
So in recent years , we have been seeing many examples “ religious ” people using social networks to further their cause .
Popular ministers such as Rick Warren and Joel Osteen have about 30,000 followers each .
You can even find people as important as His Holiness on the web .
The Muslim ’s wo n’t be outdone either !
Christians are n’t the only faith group embracing social media ; all of them are .
If you went to the Middle East Island in Second Life last week you would have been greeted by this lovely invitation .
This is an invitation to a lecture presented by the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice , they are the same people that banned cats , dogs and the color red .
The lecture commemorated Ramadan , the holy month of fasting for Muslims , and encouraged the denizens to bask in the holiness of the month .
The community that is hosting the lecture in their own virtual estate proudly boasts being able to “ revert ” 7 people from the United States to Islam when they visited the mosques .
Online evangelism is hardly as passive as this lecture makes it seem !
Religious people are taking a trick out of their playbook and being more proactive in their activities in the virtual world .
So instead of waiting for people with similar interests to flock to their virtual Meccas , they are going out soliciting con( re )verts .
Religious freedom has a total different taste when you experience it in a virtual world ; it turns into something more akin to the taste of spam .
Now it might be one thing to willfully join such a discussion but how often are we confronted by an unwelcome and overbearing piece of religious wisdom on our space .
“ Become a fan of Jesus ” anyone ?
The blessing of having your faith tested …
The only catch is that social media , and the internet at large , is naturally a medium where you have little control over the discourse .
That poses a slight problem to people trying to put forth a clear message .
Do you really need an example ?
Have you checked the Facebook page of His Holiness lately ?
You will find such lovely gems such as this :
Under this garb , we ’re perfectly ordinary Citizens :
That ’s hardly an isolated case , you can just ignore it but there is a more interesting reaction that people are having .
You must have noticed it yourself , that sometimes you would have just enough words , and balls , to actually go and let those ideas loose .
Even though you would never dare to say those exact words to your pastor or imam , somehow donning your internet persona makes you think “ Yes I can ” .
That reaction is creating a phenomenon where religious taboos are being discussed more often and they are losing their taboo status .
Probably the situation was put best in the words of Rev. Bill Reichart :
“ If total control is what you want , social media will frustrate you , But the trade - off is the ability to hear and learn , reach out in new directions ” …
“ The young do n’t do e-mail anymore , ” he said .
“ They do Facebook . ”
Now it ’s still too early to tell what affect this phenomenon will have on religions at large but one this is certain , the presence of religion on the internet and social media opened the flood gates of discourse .
This discussion is no longer bound by the limits of what is religiously acceptable , and this brought to light the “ newly ” discovered atheists ’ movement .
This is a group of people who always existed but were never able to find their voice ; through the anonymity of the net they have been able to voice it loud and clear .
Now the religious institutes are exhibiting a knee jerk reaction and dubbing it neo - atheism while the arguments they are making are as old as religion and its apologetics , they just recently could be voiced comfortably without an immediate fear of retribution .
Revelations ?
Regardless of how you view atheists and other free thinkers on the net you ca n’t deny that they became an important component in any religious discussion .
They definitely have the internet to thank for disposing them of their muffles and enabling them to express their dissent .
This in only one facet of how religion has been affected by the internet and social media , and we still have n’t fully grasped what consequences such discourse will have on religion in the long run .
Given that the majority of internet users are younger will that allow them to grow up to be more accepting of the differences in beliefs people hold or will it radicalize them ?
As social networks become more penetrative are we going to invite more and more virtual proselytizing ?
How would you feel about it if someone tried to convert you online ?
Do you consider it spam ?
Contact
In the movie " Contact " a mysterious alien race provides humankind with blueprints for an interstellar vehicle .
The designs are beamed across billions of kilometres of space by a transmitter of unimaginable power and are received on Earth by a rag - tag group of astronomers searching for signs of alien life .
The blueprints are preceded by a series of groups of a sound which , if you can imagine it , is not unlike a herd of cats dragging their claws down blackboards at the moment their fall from a high cliff is terminated by the ground .
The series consists of 100 groups of increasing numbers of the sound :
2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31 , ...
The character in the film played by Jodie Foster quickly realises that the list is the first 100 prime numbers .
Why , asks the inevitable military man , should aliens choose to send prime numbers ?
The answer is that the indivisibility of prime numbers by any number other than themselves and one is a universal truth .
We know it , and so should any other creatures of comparable or greater intelligence .
2+3=5 TRUE
2+3=4 FALSE
The great physicist and populariser of science , Carl Sagan , on whose book the film is based , next demonstrates how a shared universal mathematics and rules of logic can be extended to a common lexicon able to convey complex information .
For example , the alien versions of the statementsfurnish us with the signs for addition , equality , truth , and falsehood .
This is perhaps the best part of the story .
It successfully introduces an important point : the supposed universality of mathematics .
I say " supposed " because there are arguments both for and against this statement .
Maths could be invented or it could be discovered .
( It could be somewhere between the two : after all , we " discover " archaeological evidence and then " invent " a history around it . )
The debate is ancient and scholarly , but we can at least hope to approach it by asking why maths helps us to understand the physical universe .
To put it another way :
Why does maths work ?
Let 's start at the very beginning
The trousers of mathematics
If you 're going to tackle a question to which no - one knows the answer , the best approach is to think like you did when naps and nappies were a big part of your life .
Back then , you did n't panic because you had n't read the " right " books , you just extended your understanding of the world by experimenting .
Later , this probably continued as you took things apart to see how things worked .
Everything was an experiment - even putting on your trousers ( what happens when I try to put both legs into one hole , or to put my arms in instead of my legs , or put my trousers on my head ? )
This is exactly what we shall do here to try to get a feel for why maths is so useful .
Mathematics in fact wears two types of trousers , and this is a really multi-layered analogy as we will shortly see .
The basic distinction is like that between jeans and the very finest bespoke Italian wool trousers .
Both types look great in the right setting , and they share common themes : two legs , pockets , front fasteners , stitching , and so on .
They are in almost all important respects " the same " .
But they were designed for different reasons .
One type arose from a need for rugged , outdoorsy trousers for rugged , outdoorsy people who spend a lot of time on horses and in saloons avoiding shoot - outs .
The other type evolved , if that term can be used , for suave and sophisticated parties and gatherings , often with trays bearing large stacks of gold - foiled chocolates .
Trousers of type I ...
In our analogy , maths treated as a tool is like the jeans .
It does the job of telling you stuff about the universe and can often be applied to a wide number of different areas , much in the same way as jeans are increasingly seen many kilometres away from a horse .
Where jeans come from and why they are so good at their job is not very important .
Mathematical people who use maths as a tool are engineers , applied mathematicians and physicists , chemists , economists , social scientists and many more besides .
They construct mathematical models of their bit of the universe which turn qualities into quantities .
They then rummage in the mathematical toolbox for tools to tease new qualities from the quantities .
The right tool for the right job is all that matters - the models approximate reality in order to give us new insights .
If they simulated it exactly there would be too much information and we would learn little .
Interestingly , a large number of these people like wearing jeans .
... and trousers of type II
On the other hand , some of the people for whom maths is central to their job see it as " The Truth " of the universe .
To these people , who include pure mathematicians and theoretical physicists , the universe is mathematical : everything that happens in it is the consequence of a universal logic acting on universal mathematical rules .
This is the " expensive trousers " view of nature , because it matters where the material for the trousers comes from and how and by whom it is crafted into pleasing leg - coverings .
Intriguingly , people who ascribe to this view can often be found shopping in the more exclusive tailors .
These people want to be able to write down brief and preferably elegant equations from which all the phenomena in the universe arise .
The trousers one is limited , as are all analogies .
In particular , it is possible for mathematics to be both completely true in a literal sense and a highly effective tool used to describe the universe .
Trousers , on the other hand , are rarely both jeans and very expensive hand - tailored Italian slacks .
That 's why we said " maths wears two types of trousers " not " maths is two types of trousers " , but that does n't remedy all the limitations .
In addition , we note that some of the " maths as a tool " camp may well believe in a fundamentally mathematical universe and also never wear jeans , even when they are on horseback .
Likewise , some of the " maths as truth " people will use maths as a tool in their work , and may go home to relax in jeans .
The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics
But the key point remains : maths is incredibly effective at describing physical processes ; why ?
Let 's give some thought to where new mathematical ideas come from .
Of particular relevance here are mathematical ideas which later turn out to have some correspondence with reality .
There are countless examples , but here are just two : supersymmetry and non-Euclidean geometry .
It 's likely that most people have never heard of these mathematical ideas , but almost everyone has heard of the areas of physics which depend so heavily on them : particle physics and relativity .
These two areas are the oversize , rhinestone - covered , neon - coloured trousers of physics .
Experiments are big and expensive ; consequences profound and strange .
A successful unification of the theories would be , we are told , the greatest achievement in human history .
Both cases are built on mathematical ideas and techniques developed in advance and in ignorance of the physical theories for which they later turn out to be essential .
Such examples seem to suggest that although mathematics looks like a human invention it is in fact universal - how else could we sit at a desk and write down abstract ideas so vital for apparently fundamental physical truths in the universe ?
But crusty scholars in dusty rooms are not the only source of mathematical ideas .
Sometimes , nature seems to be prompting us with new bits of mathematics .
There are countless examples here , but a good one is the concept of a boundary layer .
Boundary layers form in a moving fluid where it touches a solid body , and by " fluid " we mean everything from tenuous gases to boiling magma .
Boundary layers are thin and the velocity of the fluid varies dramatically across them .
Their influence on the dynamics of the body belies their relative size .
For example , a common anecdote is that the laws of aerodynamics prove that bumble bees can't fly .
In fact the opposite is true .
Bumble bees superbly manipulate the boundary layers which form on the surfaces of their wings to generate " extra " lift .
So while approximations to the laws do suggest that bumble bees ' wings are too small , the full laws include boundary layer theory and do explain how they stay aloft .
The interesting point is where boundary layer theory comes from .
Boundary layers were recorded in the earliest true hydrodynamic experiments in the nineteenth century and they eventually prompted a mathematical theory which has been wildly successful .
But this theory was built on assumptions based on observations of the physical world - there is still no fundamental reason why these assumptions should be true .
We believe they are because the theory built on them predicts real - world phenomena so accurately .
You may say that relativity is also built on assumptions of the universe , but the difference here is that the physical observations actually suggested the mathematical methods required to extend the theory .
Observations implying mathematical techniques - surely this also points towards the universality of mathematics ?
Unfortunately not , because the problem boils down to a fundamental fact about science : evidence can't show that something is universally true , only that something is not universally true .
Scientists posit " null hypotheses " - essentially that in any given situation they expect nothing untoward to happen .
But null hypotheses can't be proven by evidence , they can only be shown false .
You may call it a black sheep ; I call it a false hypothesis .
Image DHD photo gallery
As an example , consider the null hypothesis : " All sheep are white " .
How would you prove this ?
Suppose that you visited every flock of sheep in Britain , would that prove it ?
No , because there are sheep in the rest of Europe too .
So what about if you saw all of those sheep as well ?
Still not enough : you 've the rest of the world still to go , and lots of lambs born in the countries you 've already been to .
But if you come across a black sheep champing the grass in the Shetlands then the hypothesis must be false .
But it is worse for our quest to understand the effectiveness of mathematics .
We can posit the null hypothesis : " Maths is a universal truth " .
Then we can go out and look for contradictions ; times or places when the laws of mathematics apparently change .
But how would we recognise those locations ?
Would a star burning in a part of the universe in which multiplication was not commutative look any different through our telescopes ?
If it did , how would we distinguish that situation from a new type of star burning in an ordinary part of the universe ?
How would we distinguish between a change in the laws of mathematics and our own ignorance of this immense universe ?
But beyond searching for evidence , can a mathematical proof be found which answers the question ?
Perhaps , one day , but whether mathematics is universal may be an unanswerable question .
Kurt Gödel proved that in any system governed by self - consistent rules there are questions which cannot be proved true or false using only the self - consistent rules themselves .
What if mathematics were universal but establishing so were impossible ?
Would we broadcast the message to our galactic cousins that mathematics is all talk and no trouser ?

Former Vice President Al Gore , center , watches as journalists Laura Ling , left and Euna Lee speak after arriving at the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank , Calif .
Clinton , journalists arrive in U.S .
Former President Bill Clinton returned to the United States Wednesday morning with the two U.S. journalists released from custody by North Korea following his surprise arrival there Tuesday .
The private plane carrying Clinton and the two journalists – Laura Ling , 32 , and Euna Lee , 36 – landed at the Burbank airport just outside Los Angeles around 8:50 a.m. eastern Wednesday morning , roughly four - and - one - half months since the two reporters were captured along the North Korean border .

After watching the two journalists depart the plane , the former president walked down the steps to the tarmac and hugged former Vice President Al Gore , the owner of the cable network that employs the journalists .
Clinton did not speak to the assembled press and stood just barely within camera shot when Ling and Gore spoke .
Gore thanked Clinton in his remarks , whom Gore called his " friend and partner . "
Gore also praised President Barack Obama and the " countless members of his administration " that have been " deeply involved in this humanitarian effort . "
After an emotional reunion with her family , Ling expressed the " deepest gratitude to President Clinton . "
" The last 140 days have been the most difficult and heart wrenching of our lives , " she said .
Speaking on the South Lawn of the White House shortly after the journalists arrival , Obama said he was " extraordinarily relieved " that the journalists had returned , but was careful not to make any mention of what the news means for future relations with North Korea .
“ Not only is this White House extraordinarily happy , but all Americans should be thankful to former President Clinton and former Vice President Gore for their extraordinary work , ” Obama said .
The former president ’s wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , told reporters in Nairobi , Kenya Wednesday that she was “ very happy and relieved ” that her husband was returning with the two journalists .
“ I spoke to my husband on the airplane and everything went well .
We are extremely excited , ” she said .
“ It 's just a good day to be able to see this happen . ”
As the families of the two journalists awaited their arrival , they released a statement thanking the former president , along with former Vice President Al Gore and the Obama administration .
“ We especially want to thank president Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and vice president Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home , ” the statement read .
" We must also thank all the people who have supported our families through this ordeal , it has meant the world to us .
We are counting the seconds to hold Laura and Euna in our arms . "
Matt McKenna , spokesman for the former president , announced Tuesday night that " President Clinton has safely left North Korea with Laura Ling and Euna Lee .
They are en route to Los Angeles where Laura and Euna will be reunited with their families . "
In a background briefing with reporters Tuesday night , a senior administration official said that in mid-July , Lee and Ling informed family members in phone calls that North Korean officials said the pair would be released if Bill Clinton were sent as an envoy .
The official said it was made " crystal clear " to the North Koreans that Clinton would visit only on an " unofficial " and " purely private , humanitarian mission . "
President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton did not talk about the trip , but U.S. government officials did brief Clinton in person twice , including a final meeting last Saturday .
The administration official said this does not represent a breakthrough for North Korea with the world community , adding , “ I do n't know of a time when the North Koreans have been more isolated . ”
North Korea ordered the release of the two American journalists detained since May following former President Bill Clinton ’s meeting Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il .
According to North Korea ’s state news agency , were pardoned after being visited by the former president .
“ Kim Jong Il issued an order of the Chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission on granting a special pardon to the two American journalists who had been sentenced to hard labor in accordance with Article 103 of the Socialist Constitution and releasing them , ” read the report from North Korea ’s official Korean Central News Agency .
Clinton met with Kim shortly after landing in Pyongyang Tuesday .
The former president , in a surprise visit , supplied Kim with a verbal message from Obama , according to the North Korean state report .
Kim and the former president then sat down for what the state media described as a “ wide - ranging exchange of views . ”
Following his meeting with Kim , Clinton spoke in person to the two journalists , according to ABC News , which cited a government source .
Administration officials refused to comment on the trip while Clinton was still in North Korea .
“ While this solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans is on the ground , we will have no comment , ” White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said earlier on Tuesday .
“ We do not want to jeopardize the success of former President Clinton 's mission . ”
Ling and Lee were captured on March 17 after venturing across the border while reporting a story for Current TV , Gore ’s San Francisco - based cable network .
The two were later sentenced to 12 years of labor .
Clinton was accompanied to North Korea by his former chief of staff , John Podesta , who more recently headed Obama ’s transition team .
Photos released by state media also show longtime Clinton aide Doug Band with the former president in Pyongyang .
I assume the mainstream media believes the administration will ultimately get its way and pass the supplemental with the IMF money attached .
But it 's just possible that it wo n't .
And the Democrats who stand in the way will be doing the party a great favor politically .
These continued giveaways to wealthy , elite institutions are political poison , which is why the Republicans are positioning themselves ( completely disingenuously ) on the other side of the big money boyz .
John Amato is weighing the idea of taking on war hawk and Bush co-conspirator Jane Harman in his southwest L.A. congressional district .
He 's fuming about Harman 's role in pushing continued fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Unlike Jane Harman , " said Amato , " I would have voted against the war supplemental budget on May 14 .
Until President Obama comes up with a plan to extricate the U.S. from Bush 's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , I would not vote to spend any money on anything other than bringing our troops home safely and promptly .
I opposed these wars under Bush and I still oppose them .
Adding the $ 108 billion for bailing out irresponsible European bankers who made ill - advised and overly risky bets , has made this legislation far more objectionable .
That money would be enough to solve all the problems Schwarzenegger has caused since he took office here in California .
If Rahm Emanuel is so dead set on a bail out , let him bail out the Golden State . "
Digby , who has been consumed all week writing the new Harry and Louise television scripts for Montana and Arkansas ad campaigns , has n't let up on her never - ending crusade to end the unjustifiable wars in the Middle East .
She pointed out today that the mainstream media has completely ignored the story about how Emanuel can't bribe and beat up enough Democrats to get them to sign on to his Frankenstein suicide pact ( AKA - the war supplemental - cum - European bank bailout bill ) :
And Jane Hamsher has been organizing a Netroots response to Emanuel 's jihad to the point where I 'm starting to fear for her health .
Although she looks damn good in this video Brave New Films shot of her today , does n't she ?
And , my friends , that , plus myself , is the board of Blue America .
Our PAC is going to need some help supporting progressive stalwarts like Donna Edwards and Alan Grayson who are n't succumbing to Emanuel 's demands and for Digby 's brilliant TV campaign -- although if you like the idea of killing innocent civilians in Afghanistan and you agree with the Republicans that Americans do n't need universal health care , you should probably not donate .

Since trade liberalization between Central and North America , imports and availability of processed , high - fat and high - sugar foods have increased dramatically .
Researchers writing in BioMed Central 's open access journal Globalization and Health link this influx of American junk food to a ' nutrition transition ' in Central American countries , with a growing burden diet - related chronic disease .
Anne Marie
Thow , from the University of Sydney , worked with Corinna Hawkes from the University of Sao Paolo , Brazil , to compare import , production and availability data for various foodstuffs to changes in tariff and non-tariff barriers for several Central American countries .
Thow said , " Central America has undergone extensive trade liberalization over the past two decades , and has recently signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States .
These policies have implications for health in the region .
Specifically , they have been a factor in facilitating the ' nutrition transition ' , which is associated with rising rates of obesity and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer " .
Average tariffs in Central America declined from 45 % in 1985 to around 6 % in 2000 .
In line with this , total food imports into the Central American countries more than doubled between 1990/92-2003/05 from 4.5 to 9.6 million tones .
During that time period , imports of processed cheese , such as cheese slices , rose 3215 % to comprise 37 % of all cheese imports from the US , and French fries formed 23 % of all imports of fruits and vegetables .
According to Thow , " In Central America , liberalization appears to have directly influenced the availability and price of meat and processed foods , many of which are energy - dense and high in fats , sugars and salt " .
The researchers conclude , " While there are arguments for and against trade liberalization , it is essential to consider its effects on the poor .
Factors affecting income and distribution are important in determining diet and health , and these factors are likely to be more significant for the poor in the process of uneven dietary development " .

* Rich urge poor to accept halving of emissions
* “ Strong resistance ” from China - Berlusconi
( Recasts , updates throughout )
ROME , July 7 ( Reuters ) - Rich nations sought to persuade China and India on Tuesday to agree to a goal of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at a summit of major economies in Italy later this week .
Environment ministers or senior officials from the 17 - member Major Economies Forum ( MEF ) met in Rome , trying to end deadlock over a declaration that could be a step towards a new U.N. climate pact due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
“ Positions have not shifted , ” a delegate said of the talks , called at the last minute to help leaders agree a united front on climate change on Thursday in L’Aquila , Italy , during a Group of Eight summit .
China and India have been opposed to a goal of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as part of a declaration by MEF nations , which account for 80 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions .
The G8 countries -- the United States , Japan , Russia , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada -- adopted a “ vision ” of a 50 percent cut in global emissions by 2050 last year and want major developing nations to sign up too .
But developing nations say the rich are to blame for most emissions from burning greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution and must set deep 2020 goals for cutting their own emissions before asking for help with 2050 goals .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi also told a news conference that China was resisting progress on the climate .
VANGUARD
“ Europe wants to be in the vanguard , the Obama administration is in the same position , but there is strong resistance that I have encountered with the Chinese presidency , ” said Berlusconi , referring to a meeting on Monday .
A June 30 MEF draft drawn up by the United States and Mexico said that : “ We support an aspirational global goal of reducing global emissions by 50 percent by 2050 , with developed countries reducing emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 . ”
China and Indian officials have said that poor nations need to be allowed to use more energy to end poverty .
China has recently overtaken the United States as top world emitter and India is fourth behind Russia .
If the deadlock persists , U.S. President Barack Obama , who sees the MEF as a step towards a U.N. deal , would end the July 9 meeting with just a “ chair ’s summary ” rather than a statement agreed by all 17 MEF leaders .
“ Only ambitious action by the G8 could break the deadlock in the negotiations , ” said Tobias Muenchmeyer of environmental group Greenpeace .
He noted that China and India want rich nations to cut emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020 below 1990 levels and far higher climate investments .
A separate climate draft for the G8 , dated June 24 , indicated progress towards setting a target of limiting a rise in world temperatures to two degrees Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) over pre-industrial times .
The European Union views 2C as a threshold for “ dangerous ” climate changes such as ever more heatwaves , floods , droughts and extinctions .
The United States , Russia , Canada and Japan have not signed up for such a target at the G8 .
The G8 draft said “ global emissions should peak by 2020 and then be substantially reduced to limit the average increases in global temperature to 2 Celsius above pre-industrial levels . ”
There is probably no more hostile environment to mental health treatment than the military .
Recently , a new treatment method has been widely adopted by the UK Armed Forces and , perhaps for the first time in history , officers are requesting it in droves .
In major wars since the 20th century more fighters have been lost to psychiatric casualties than bodily injuries but psychiatrists and psychologists are still mistrusted by the corps .
It was explained to me rather tactfully that “ soldiers are not necessarily the most psychologically minded of individuals ” and it is likely a combination of the macho culture and conditioning to deal with discomfort by sheer grit that casts mental strain as weakness in the military .
This has made both mental health problems and their treatment a source of significant stigma in one of the professions most likely to cause trauma and breakdown in its employees .
Trauma Risk Management or TRiM was first developed by the Royal Marines , one of the UK ’s most hardened battle corps , and trains key members to recognise signs of mental strain in their comrades and provides support at the level of the unit .
It ’s a wonderfully conceived approach as it takes advantage of the esprit de corps , the intense group bond that forms between fellow soldiers , but which also makes them wary of accepting help from ‘ outsiders ’ .
But it also avoids the practice of sending in outsiders to provide ‘ debriefings ’ after traumatic incidents which have been found , in many cases , to make the trauma worse .
A recent paper [ pdf ] published in Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps outlines the TRiM approach .
Non-medical mid-level soldiers are trained to assess their colleagues after a potentially traumatic event and look for risk factors for poor - coping , provide information on which psychological reactions to expect , give informal support and know when to refer to specialist medical staff .
More widely the approach aims to change attitudes to mental distress by making it both an acceptable topic and another form of operational training .
And it is clear that there is a currently a need for a different approach , particularly it seems , in the US military .
A recent review of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in soldiers deployed to Iraq found that , seemingly uniquely , US soldiers show increased levels of the disorder one year after returning from the war zone .
This is exactly the opposite pattern to that which is typically seen in other soldiers and civilians .
Science writer David Dobbs has received a lot of flak for suggesting that the system that provides mental health treatment to US veterans is unintentionally encouraging long - term disability but the figures suggest he may be right .
TRiM could be an effective counter - measure to mental illness in the military and it is certainly popular .
It is also being adopted widely in the civilian emergency services , but it remains under - researched .
The recent paper on TRiM notes that a trial is currently being run by the UK Ministry of Defence and preliminary results suggest cautious optimism although we still await the first published study its effectiveness when deployed on the ground .
In light of the lack of evidence , it ’s perhaps a little worrying that TRiM is being increasingly flashed around as a PR - friendly talisman of good practice whenever the military ’s mental health credentials are questioned and it has also now become the basis of a minor training industry .
Nevertheless , the simple fact that it has been accepted and requested by the armed forces themselves is a significant advance for military psychiatry .

The shipping industry is under fire over greenhouse gas emissions
The United Nations is discussing rules to cut the soaring emission of greenhouse gases from shipping .
The environment committee of the International Maritime Organisation is drawing up recommendations for design standards to make ships more efficient .
It includes working on operating standards so that ships save fuel .
But great progress is not expected on a demand involving a levy on fuel used by ships - something environmentalists have been calling for .
Shipping now accounts for more than 3 % of annual global emissions .
That is more than the entire UK economy .
But , like aviation , it has no controls on its greenhouse gases .
With international emissions from ships rising 85 % since 1990 , there 's a will to include the industry in the global deal on climate change at the UN 's climate summit in Copenhagen , Denmark , in December .
The IMO environment committee hopes to draw up recommendations on mandatory improvements in ship design .
It also aims to frame rules on the way ships are operated , getting them to sail more slowly or more directly , for instance .
But the committee is not expected to make huge progress on a key demand from environmentalists for a levy on ships ' fuel , with the proceeds going to help developing countries adapt to climate change .
This contentious issue will probably have to wait until the full meeting of the IMO in the autumn .
Observers of the shipping industry 's record on protecting the environment may not be optimistic about the outcome .

Previously , ministers had avoided talking about a job that did not exist Tony Blair will be the UK 's official candidate for EU president , Baroness Kinnock has apparently confirmed .
The post will only be created if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified by all EU states - Ireland is to hold a second referendum in October .
There has long been speculation that the former PM would go for the post but he has not confirmed he will do so .
It is the first time a UK government minister has publicly announced Tony Blair is a candidate for the job .
Previously , ministers have said it was premature to talk of supporting any particular candidate when the job itself did not exist .
' Strength of character '
But at a briefing in Strasbourg , Europe Minister Lady Kinnock said : " The UK government is supporting Tony Blair 's candidature for president of the Council [ of EU governments ] . "
Asked if it had been discussed with Mr Blair , currently a Middle East envoy , she said : " It is the government 's position .
I am sure they would not do that without asking him . "
Lady Kinnock went on to say Mr Blair had the " strength of character " and " status " to take on the job .
As we have said , time and again on this , there is nothing to be a candidate for since the job does n't actually exist
Tony Blair 's spokesman
She added : " People know who he is , and he could step into this new role with a lot of respect and he would be generally welcomed . "
But there have been reports that Mr Blair 's role in the Iraq war and Britain 's failure to join the euro , could go against him .
Mr Blair 's spokesman said later : " As we have said , time and again on this , there is nothing to be a candidate for since the job does n't actually exist . "
Ireland was the only EU member state to hold a public vote on the treaty , which must be ratified by all 27 countries .
The treaty was rejected in that referendum last June .
It will hold a second referendum in the autumn .
' Ambitious operator '
The precise role of the EU president has not been laid out .
The Swedish government , which currently holds the six - month EU presidency , has suggested drawing up a proper job description before seeing which available political figure fits it best .
Downing Street said if Mr Blair wants to stand for the job , the government would support him but it was up to him to decide if he wanted to put his name forward .
Any holder is likely to try to centralise power for themselves in Brussels and dominate national foreign policies
William Hague
Conservatives
The prime minister 's spokesman declined to say whether Mr Brown had discussed the post with Tony Blair or had encouraged him to stand .
The Conservatives , whose efforts to get a UK referendum on the treaty were defeated in the Commons , said the British people had not been given a say on whether Europe should have a new president .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said the new role could be " enormously damaging " .
" Any holder is likely to try to centralise power for themselves in Brussels and dominate national foreign policies .
" In the hands of an operator as ambitious as Tony Blair , that is a near certainty .
He should be let nowhere near the job . "
Potential rivals Former Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez , a socialist , is seen as a potential rival to Mr Blair for the presidency job .
According to Jean - Marie Colombani , a former editor of the French daily Le Monde , French President Nicolas Sarkozy now favours Mr Gonzalez for the job .
Earlier Mr Sarkozy had been seen as a powerful Blair supporter .
Mr Gonzalez , 67 , currently heads a group of " wise men " - leading experts from various backgrounds - appointed to help shape the EU 's future .
Tony Blair may well be a respected politician around the world , but he is also yesterday 's news
Lorraine Mullally
Open Europe But Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has described Mr Blair - a longstanding friend - as the " ideal personality " to be EU president .
Another potential rival is Jean - Claude Juncker , the veteran centre - right Luxembourg prime minister who has been at the heart of key EU negotiations since 1992 .
He has said the EU presidency job would interest him if it has sufficient clout .
Campaign group Open Europe said the EU should stick with the rotating presidency which allows the current national leaders - who have a democratic mandate - to set the EU 's agenda on a six - monthly basis .
Director Lorraine Mullally said : " Tony Blair may well be a respected politician around the world , but he is also yesterday 's news .
" The problem with creating a post of EU president is that it would inevitably go to an ex-leader who has lost the support of his or her own electorate . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British girl who was given an extra heart as a toddler has become the world ’s first heart transplant patient to make a full recovery after having her donor organ removed and function restored to her original heart .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Hannah Clark , now 16 , had a “ piggyback ” transplant operation in 1995 aged two , when a new heart was inserted in parallel to her own failing one .
The donor organ had to be removed 3 - 1/ 2 years ago because the immunosuppressant drugs she was taking to avoid organ rejection caused cancer -- but by then her own heart had recovered sufficiently to work on its own .
Since the surgery , which took place in 2006 , Clark has made a full recovery from the cancer and has a normal cardiac function , her doctors said on Tuesday .
“ Now we are a lot more confident ( about this procedure ) , ” said Magdi Yacoub from Imperial College London , who co-led the surgery team .
“ The heart muscle itself , which was not doing anything at all , has recovered . ”
He added cardiomyopathy , or the deterioration of the function of the heart muscle , was relatively common in children in the first year of their life .
Victor Tsang from Great Ormond Street Hospital , who was the other surgery team leader , said Clarke ’s case offered hope for other patients with heart failure .
“ Hannah ’s case highlights that in cases of cardiomyopathy such as hers , it is possible for the patient ’s own heart to make a full recovery if it is given adequate support to do so , ” Tsang told reporters .
Her case study was reported in the Lancet medical journal .
Clark , who was forced to take 16 different drugs at one stage to control her illness , burst into tears when a journalist asked her to relate how her life has changed with the surgery .
She said she was cherishing every moment and now has a Saturday job working with animals .
“ Thanks to this operation , I ’ve now got a normal life just like all of my friends . ”
Her mother Elizabeth Clark said : “ She does n’t think about tomorrow , she thinks about today .
She wakes up smiling every day . ”
What ’s the one thing Barney Frank and Ron Paul can agree on ?
That it ’s time to audit the Federal Reserve .
Frank :
“ They have had since 1932 … the right to intervene in the economy almost whenever they ” wanted to , Frank said , noting that the Fed relied on its extraordinary lending power to forward billions to financial institutions last fall .
He intends to curtail that lending power , he said .
“ Finally we will subject them to a complete audit , ” he said .
Frank ’s announcement that legislation to make the Fed more transparent would pass the House of Representatives “ probably in October ” came on the heels of a judge ’s decision requiring the Fed to obey the Freedom of Information Act :
The Fed has refused to name the financial firms it lent to or disclose the amounts or the assets put up as collateral under 11 programs , most put in place during the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression , saying that doing so might set off a run by depositors and unsettle shareholders .
Bloomberg LP , the New York - based company majority - owned by Mayor Michael Bloomberg , sued on Nov. 7 on behalf of its Bloomberg News unit .
“ The Federal Reserve has to be accountable for the decisions that it makes , ” said U.S. Representative Alan Grayson , a Florida Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee , after Preska ’s ruling .
“ It ’s one thing to say that the Federal Reserve is an independent institution .
It ’s another thing to say that it can keep us all in the dark . ” ( Emphasis mine )
The Federal Reserve was created to take politics out of economic decision - making .
Franks is careful to point out that the House bill will avoid damaging that independence :
“ I have been working with Ron Paul , the main sponsor of that bill .
He agrees that we do n’t want to have the audit appear as if it is influencing monetary policy , because that would be inflationary and Ron and I agree on that . ” [… ]
“ One of the things the audit will show is what the Federal Reserve buys and sells , and that will be made public , ” Frank said .
“ But not instantly , because … you would have a lot of people trading off of that , and you would have too much impact on the market .
Again Ron agrees with that , so we will probably have that data released after a time period of several months , enough time so it would n’t be market - sensitive .
That will be part of the overall Fed regulation that we are inducting . ”
Progressives need to get on the right side of popular outrage over taxpayer bailouts of financial institutions .
Transparency is , and should always be , a part of the progressive agenda .
By Richard Clarke Andrey Arshavin struck twice in the final four minutes as Arsenal beat Atletico Madrid 2 - 1 to end Day One on top of the Emirates Cup standings .
To be honest , little had happened in this game before Jack Wilshere ’s introduction at half time .
The teenage midfielder tantalised the Spanish defence for 45 minutes however it would be a Russian who won the game for the home side .
Arshavin seemed to have done that in the 86th minute when he volleyed in from a Cesc Fabregas cross however German Pacheco levelled seconds later .
A draw seemed certain but , then again , nothing is certain with Arshavin on the pitch .
In the dying seconds , he raced onto an errant backheader , flicked the ball past the keeper and squeezed the ball home from an almost impossible angle .
It was four minutes of madness after a pretty mundane 86 .
But it was good enough to win the game and puts Arsenal in pole position to regain their home trophy .
Wenger always intended to spread his squad across this two - game weekend but , nonetheless , his side this afternoon was reasonably strong .
The most significant news was the return of Tomas Rosicky after 19 months away .
Thomas Vermaelen had been forced off at the end of the friendly at Hannover on Wednesday and , as a result , did not appear today .
The formation was the now established wide 4 - 3 - 3 but this time Robin van Persie was flanked on the left by Nicklas Bendtner and on the right by Emmanuel Eboue .
Atletico started with Diego Forlan up front and Jose Antonio Reyes on the right .
The former Manchester United forward was never going to be that popular among the home crowd but the announcement of the latter was cheered by the Emirates faithful .
Reyes had a record of 23 goals in 110 appearances during his three years at Highbury .
It was the Spaniard who provided the first telling moment of the game .
In the sixth minute , Reyes took the corner from the right , Raul Garcia nodded on at the near post and Sergio Aguero sent his header into the sidenetting at the far .
A player of his stature should have done better .
Rosicky nearly had a made an immediate impact on his return but , despite his finger - wagging protestations to the assistant referee , he was correctly called offside before slamming the ball into the top corner from the edge of the area .
It was a bright beginning but it could not be maintained .
Opportunities were scarce in a mundane first 45 minutes .
Forlan and Florent Sinama - Pongolle both had half - chances with headers .
However , generally , Arsenal were the slicker side .
That said , the most they could muster was a curling cross from Armand Traore than caused Atletico keeper Sergio Asenjo to bat the ball away while Van Persie had a free - kick deflected over .
Three minutes from the break , the Dutchman fed Eboue on the left .
The Ivorian cut in and fired straight at Asenjo , who stood firm .
Wenger replaced Rosicky , Eboue and Traore with Wilshere , Fran Merida and Gael Clichy at the start of the second half .
The latter pair were playing their first pre-season games of 2009 / 10 .
While the first of the trio , Wilshere , showed class from the off as Arsenal took control .
Three minutes in he sent Sagna clear on the right and the full back ’s low cross was backflicked towards goal by Van Persie only for John Heitinga to knock the ball off the line .
Almost immediately , Bendtner controlled Wilshere ’s lofted cross at the far post and blazed over when , at least , he should have employed the keeper .
Just past the hour , substitute Maxi Rodriguez sent in a shot from distance and Mannone could only half - punch the ball behind .
However within seconds Clichy sent over a tantalising cross from the left and Wilshere fooled his marker on the byline before laying the ball back to Ramsey .
The Welshman had time and space , on reflection perhaps too much .
His powerful shot was a parried by Asenjo .
It was Ramsey ’s last contribution .
He joined Bendtner and Van Persie as they were replaced by Eduardo , Arshavin and Fabregas .
It was perhaps the boost Arsenal needed .
Within seconds
Wilshere clipped another clever ball to the far post and Merida slid in seconds too late .
Both sides went for the win towards the end .
Rodriguez fired a shot across the face of goal then Mannone parried a swerving drive from Borja Baston on to the bar .
Four minutes from time , Arshavin had seemingly won it won he volleyed in a Fabregas cross but Pacecho ’s breakaway strike proved otherwise .
So Arshavin did what Arshavin does – he won it again .
The 27 - year - old raced on to a misplaced backheader , beat the keeper and turned to ball home .
An incredible finish .
Roll on Sunday .

There is no hiding the fact that last Saturday ’s march in rejection of the new Education Bill has unsettled the regime ’s nerves .
In the span of one week , the regime has jailed 12 peaceful protesters , including tonight the jailing of the “ Prefecto ” of the Metropolitan District ( The highest civil authority below the Mayor ) , as the Government continues searching for Oscar Perez , one of the organizers of last Saturday ’s march , who will be charged for nothing more than …organizing it .
And while the only person charged in the attack of the Cadena Capriles reporters is at large , released on his own recognizance , al of these people are being sent to jail , including Prefect Richard Blanco , being sent to the Yare jail , the same one where Hugo Chavez was sent to after his 1992 bloody coup attempt .
And this is now state policy as clearly oulined and defined by the ineffable and fascist Prosecutor Luisa Ortega , who threatened to jail those “ citizens that march for any motive ” , altering peace with the only purpose of destabilizing the Government .
Truly remarkable fascist logic by the person in charge of defending the country ’s laws .
In fact , as if this was not enough Ortega suggested that marching and protesting may even be considered civil rebellion , which carries a penalty from 12 to 24 years .
Of course , when a peaceful opposition march is attacked by Chavistas hiding at a school ( on a Saturday ? ) in San Cristobal , nothing happens .
This does not create panic or fear .
I imagine in the Prosecutor ’s fascist mind , the marchers deserve the treatment .
It ’s the new “ Double Way ” of XXIst Century Facism in Venezuela .
And as if this was not enough , even passive criticism of the Government is now being persecuted , as in the case of the medical doctor who dared suggest that four people had died from swine flu at her hospital and may be charged with “ providing false information … which may cause panic or anxiety in the population ” .
( She is not the first one to question Venezuela ’s numbers on swine flu which are considered to be statistically quite low )
This is all aimed at intimidation : Organize a march , you may be sent to jail , speak against the Government , you may be sent to jail , write criticizing the Government , I may be sent to jail .
It ’s a new phase , the criminalization of protest and dissent , a continuation of the dictatorial and fascist ways that the robolution has been implementing more and more as its popularity drops and the economy coems apart at the seams .

XSPARQL Submission
Submitted Materials
We , W3C Member (s ) Asemantics S.R.L. , DERI Galway at the National University of Ireland , Galway , Ireland , Fundación CTIC ( Centro Tecnológico para el Desarrollo en Asturias de las Tecnologías de la Información y la Comunicación ) , Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique ( INRIA ) , Ontotext , OpenLink Software Inc. , Profium , Talis Information Limited , and University of Innsbruck hereby submit to the Consortium the following specification , comprising the following document ( s ) attached hereto :

We request the Submission be known as the XSPARQL Submission .
Change Control
Revision and change control of the Submission shall remain with the Submitters until such time as a suitable W3C group is formed .
Abstract
With currently available tools and languages , translating between an existing XML format and RDF is a tedious and error - prone task .
The importance of this problem is acknowledged by the W3C GRDDL working group who faces the issue of extracting RDF data out of existing HTML or XML files , as well as by the Web service community around SAWSDL , who need to perform lowering and lifting between RDF data from a semantic client and XML messages for a Web service .
However , at the moment , both these groups rely solely on XSLT transformations between RDF / XML and the respective other XML format at hand .
We propose a more natural approach for such transformations based on merging XQuery and SPARQL into the novel language XSPARQL .
Recently , two new languages have entered the stage for processing XML and RDF data : XQuery is a W3C Recommendation since early last year and SPARQL has finally received W3 C's Recommendation stamp in January 2008 .
While both languages operate in their own worlds - SPARQL in the RDF - and XQuery in the XML - world - we show in this specification that the merge of both in the novel language XSPARQL has the potential to finally bring XML and RDF closer together .
XSPARQL provides concise and intuitive solutions for mapping between XML and RDF in either direction , addressing both the use cases of GRDDL and SAWSDL .
As a side effect , XSPARQL may also be used for RDF to RDF transformations beyond the capabilities of " pure " SPARQL .
We also describe an implementation of XSPARQL , available for user evaluation .
While XSPARQL is not intended to replace XQuery or to define a general approach to XQuery extensibility , XSPARQL use cases can serve as use cases for such an extensibility mechanism .

In a policy address at the Council on Foreign Relations last month , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said of Iran , “ We can not be afraid or unwilling to engage . ”
But the Iranian government has yet to accept President Obama ’s outstretched hand .
Even if Tehran suddenly acceded to talks , U.S. policy makers must prepare for the eventuality that diplomacy fails .
While there has been much discussion of economic sanctions , we cannot neglect the military ’s role in a Plan B .
There has been a lack of serious ...
Look , it is possible to have universal care without a public option ; Switzerland does .
But there are some good reasons for the prominence of the public option in our debate .
One is substantive : to have a workable system without the public option , you need to have effective regulation of the insurers .
Given the realities of our money - dominated politics , you really have to worry whether that can be done — which is a reason to have a more or less automatic mechanism for disciplining the industry .
The second is what the option debate says about Obama .
If progressives had real trust in Obama ’s commitment to doing the right thing , the administration would have broad leeway to do deals .
But the president does n’t command that kind of trust .
Partly it ’s a matter of style — as many people have noted , he has been weirdly reluctant to make the moral case for universal care , weirdly unable to show passion on the issue , weirdly diffident even about the blatant lies from the right .
Partly it ’s a spillover from his other policies : by appointing an economic team that ’s Rubin redux , by taking such a kindly attitude to the banks , he has squandered a lot of progressive enthusiasm .
Add in the dealmaking as part of the health care process itself , and progressives can be forgiven for having the impression that Obama ( a ) takes them for granted ( b ) is way too easily rolled by the other side .
So progressives have their backs up over one provision in health care reform that ’s easy to monitor .
The public option has become not so much a symbol as a signal , a test of whether Obama is really the progressive activists thought they were backing .
And the bizarre thing is that the administration does n’t seem to get that .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department on Monday continued to publicly downplay the threat North Korea presents to the United States with spokesman P.J. Crowley telling reporters North Korea " represents an infinitesimal threat to the United States directly . "
A North Korean soldier looks at the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone earlier this month .
The spokesman 's statement followed comments from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an interview with ABC , broadcast Monday , in which she said the reason for the United States ' low - key reaction to North Korea 's recent missile test was that the United States was n't " going to give the North Koreans the satisfaction they were looking for , which was to elevate them to center stage . "
In that interview , Clinton said North Korea has a " constant demand for attention , " and she added , " maybe it 's the mother in me , the experience I 've had with small children and teenagers and people who are demanding attention : Do n't give it to them . "
After calling the direct threat to the U.S. " infinitesimal , " Crowley went on to say that " North Korea , and its provocative actions , does represent a significant threat to the region and its actions recently have been unhelpful and potentially destabilizing . "
A senior U.S. official , who did not want to be identified , said there is a " theoretical " question of whether a North Korean missile could hit the United States .
" There 's nothing in their recent development , " he said , " which would suggest that their technology is becoming more accurate . "
The United States says its primary concerns about North Korea 's actions are its impact on security in the region and the risk of nuclear proliferation .
Last week the United Nations imposed sanctions on a number of individuals , companies and goods connected with North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs .
Taking aim at several key North Korean officials , it subjected them to a freeze on their assets and an international travel ban .
All About North Korea • U.S. Department of State • Hillary Clinton
Night vision goggles .
Missile guidance chips .
Triggered spark gaps used to detonate nuclear weapons .
Electronic sensors used in improvised explosive devices .
Military - grade body armor .
Digital radios employed by U.S. Special Forces .
Tags , to let troops identify one another in the dark .
That 's just some of the sensitive military gear that investigators from the Government Accountability Office were able to openly purchase – and then " illegally expor[t ] without detection . "
During a 13 - month investigation , the GAO used " a bogus front company and fictitious identities " to buy the gadgets " in demand by foreign governments and terrorist organizations " around the world , Office special investigations chief Gregory Kutz told a Congressional panel today .
Most of the purchases were made online , with seller relying on only the flimsiest of security checks to make sure the gear is n't shipped to hostile governments or groups .
Take the " infrared flags , " currently in use by U.S. military forces to help identify friendly soldiers during nighttime operations .
In normal light , they look like black squares .
" However , with the use of U.S. military night - vision technology , the patches reveal a U.S. flag , and are the same IR flags used on U.S. military combat uniforms .
An enemy fighter wearing these IR flags could potentially pass as a friendly service member during a night combat situation , putting U.S. troops at risk . "
The distributor 's web site claims that the company always " checks for military identification " when selling the tags .
" However , the seller failed to request identification from our undercover investigator ..
In the end , our fictitious buyer was only required to provide a name , credit card , and domestic address for shipment to purchase these items .
After purchasing and receiving the IR flags , we also obtained a price quote for an additional 400 IR flags . "
Hundreds of people could have presented themselves as American forces .
The deal for night vision goggles was even looser .
Not only did the distributor ship the gear to a bogus company at a fake address , Kutz reported .
" During our undercover purchase , the seller certified our bogus company to be a distributor of the item by signing a dealer / reseller agreement .
This allowed us to circumvent the seller ’s voluntary restrictions on only selling the items to military and law - enforcement agencies . "
Shipping the goods overseas was just as easy , and just as sketchy .
" Dummy " versions of the items were sent through the commercial mail in nondescript packages .
" The boxes passed through U.S. customs controls without being inspected , " despite the destination being " a known transshipment point for items being sent to terrorist organizations and other foreign governments , " Kutz eplained .
When we discussed our covert shipments with State , Commerce , and various law - enforcement agencies responsible for monitoring packages , vehicles , and persons exiting the United States , they were not surprised by our success .
Officials from several agencies stated that there is no practical way to ensure that otherwise unsuspicious people , vehicles , or packages leaving the United States that carry or contain export - controlled items can be identified and searched consistently .

Soapbox Derby - Finish Line Composite
And here 's my composite with all four teams and a track .
This did n't include the finish line tape , but that will be added in later .
Chris decided he preferred a smoother line for the road rather than the grassy edge , so the final image will probably use that instead .
Chris will be colorizing the art , and you can see one sample of it now on the Dice Hate Me website here .

Soapbox Derby - Final Team Drawings
Here are the final drawings for each team .
Teams 3 and 4 are further back , and I decided to draw them at a smaller scale rather drawing them at the same size and shrinking them down later .
That would have given them more detail , but the line thickness would be very thin .
I preferred to have it look more like all parts of one drawing rather than a composite .

﻿ 5 Things I Didn't , And You Probably Didn't , Know About CERN
I was lucky enough to go to CERN last week .
Unfortunately I was there for work , which meant I could n't harass particle physicists as much as I wanted to , but I did get to see the Compact Muon Solenoid ( compact as in only 15 metres tall ) , and I did learn some things I did not know , despite being a particle physics / CERN fangirl .
Since I was very little I have known of CERN — my dad 's best friend worked there — and since I read my first book on particle physics ( circa 8 years old ) I have wanted to work in it .
So I was very excited .
We 're talking squealing , jumping up and down , planning my pillaging of the guest shoppe , etc .
With my camera batteries fully charged I set off ...
I knew CERN was international territory — it straddles the border between France and Suisse , so when going round the site you need your passport .
What I did n't know is that there are no definitive laws governing there .
I assume if a violent crime was committed they 'd call in the authorities ( tossing a coin to decide which ) , but otherwise , as long as you do n't break the speed of light or violate the uncertainty principle , you can do what you want .
It seems to have worked pretty well , with at least one class of Feynman diagrams ( the cutest in my opinion ) owing their existence to the use of illegal substances .
Or at least there were n't until 2004 , when the Indian atomic energy authority presented the guys with this frankly lovely statue of Shiva in his aspect of Natarajah , treading on the dwarf of ignorance .
I approve .
Although they stressed it was art not religion , the fact that there was a god on site was somewhat contentious until everyone got bored with arguing about the issues and just accepted that , in the words of James Gillies , Mr. Communication - at - CERN , ' There never used to be any religious icons at CERN .
But now there are .'
Personally I would have thought the fact that Shiva is the god of destruction — the Oppenheimer quote on seeing the first atomic explosion ' Now I am become Death , the destroyer of worlds ' , refers to him — would be more of an issue , what with CERN 's rep as a black hole generating , world - destroying , Vatican - sploding machine .
But hey .
At some point , I presume , someone noticed that they had some spare high energy particles and made a list of things you can do with them .
Quite a lot , it turns out .
Among others , they fire speeding protons at nuclei to make exciting radioactive atoms for study purposes .
They use the proton 's evil twin , the antiproton — or is it the proton that is evil ?
I can never remember — to study the differences between matter and anti-matter .
They 're even doing climate research , firing muons ( electrons ' big brothers ) through an old - school - style cloud chamber ( does what it says on the tin : chamber containing lots of water droplets on the verge of condensing ) to see how and if Cosmic Rays affect the formation of cloud cover .
It costs about 600 million Euros a year to run , about the same as a large university — pretty much exactly the same as Oxford , actually .
Some of that goes on salaries , some on admin , some on central buildings , and of course some on the super - exciting building projects .
With regard to those , the LHC has cost all the countries involved a total of 6 billion dollars — less than 1 % of a US bailout , and just under 8 % of a British one .
And we ( that is , humankind ) get to keep all the science produced , rather than watching some dudes swap , hoard and play tiddlywinks with our hard - earned beer tokens .
According to the theories of management , CERN should n't work .
It 's got 7,000 people and minimal hierarchy .
This is their structure : click for boring diagram .
Note lack of bureaucrats , middle management , etc .
There 's no seniority , perks or jockeying for position — all the offices are the same size , and no - one seems to be interested in trophy secretaries .
Around the big ring there are four separate experiments , each with between 1000 - 2500 people .
Each has a spokesperson and a resource coordinator .
That 's it .
This makes management people and professional organisers ' brains explode thinking of reasons why it does n't really work .
Apparently there 's no allowance in their models for the fact that people work harder if their work is stimulating , productive and important .
Generally , CERN seems to be a really cool place ... lots of people sitting round discussing particles over beer .
I 'd go and work there like a shot if it was n't in Switzerland , AKA land of accounting , precise time - keeping , accordions and a notable lack of punk .
Homeless for more than a year and penniless since she lost her wallet this week , Cynthia Cronkhite scraped together $ 2.75 for bus fare to travel to the north Etobicoke welfare office for help .
The office near Pearson airport is one of just three still operating since civic workers went on strike June 22 .
The remaining 11 offices are closed , forcing people such as Cronkhite , who lives near the city 's Queensway office , to travel long distances for service .
At least once during the first week of the strike the north Etobicoke office was closed by picketers who stopped management staff from entering until late in the afternoon .
Last week , about a dozen unionized staff who tried to go back to work clashed with their striking colleagues on the picket line , resulting in calls to police .
Two security guards are now posted at the main entrance and two private investigators have been capturing everything on camera , although those workers remain on the sidelines .
Picketers allowed the centre 's management staff to enter with no delays yesterday , but forced dozens of other non-unionized staff deployed to the site to wait about five minutes each .
But any delays for non-union staff at welfare offices are unacceptable , said city spokesman Kevin Sack , who visited the site with city manager Joe Pennachetti on Thursday .
" They are providing – or trying to provide – service to the city 's most vulnerable people , " Sack said .
" It 's really important that the union understands that this kind of work is important and should take place in an atmosphere where people who are going through a tough time do n't have to go through a tougher time to access the kind of assistance that they need .
" By unnecessarily delaying both the staff that work there – and the clients – it poses an undue and unfair hardship .
It 's just not right .
We hope that it stops , " Sack said , adding that the city is considering all options , including a court injunction .
Mayor David Miller said yesterday that Pennachetti wrote a letter seeking the cooperation of CUPE Local 79 president Ann Dembinski and Local 416 president Mark Ferguson .
The letter says the city will " take the strongest possible action " unless there is an immediate end to picket line activity that is harmful to welfare recipients .
In addition to being made to wait , " Toronto 's most vulnerable residents have also been asked to identify themselves to picketers and to prove that they are recipients of social service benefits ; this is illegal , offensive , inappropriate and cannot be permitted to continue . "
While Miller said officials have standing orders to apply for court injunctions , he stressed the city must gather evidence to show that people are being illegally delayed from entering city premises .
" As you can understand , it 's a bit complicated to get the evidence .
If a Torontonian is stopped , for example , we need an affidavit from that person . "
On Thursday afternoon , Cronkhite entered the office with ease and left with a cheque for $ 300 – to cover basic and emergency needs .
" The strikers were very kind and polite , " she said .
And inside , management staff running the office were " fantastic ... very polite . "
However , strikebound welfare offices are equipped to hand out emergency aid only and can't offer extras such as job counselling or TTC tickets .
As a result , Cronkhite flagged down a taxi to take her to the nearest cheque - cashing outlet so she could get home .
" It 's a big pain , " she said as she hopped into a cab , which she said she 'd pay when she cashes her cheque .
" But what am I supposed to do ? "
Strikers say they are operating an orderly picket and not harassing welfare recipients .
" We 're letting them go in freely .
They have nothing to do with this .
Our fight is n't with them , " said picket captain Radha Ghagare .
But across the street , unionized workers who want to cross the picket line and return to work are feeling the heat .
" They intimidate us , " said one .
" They are taking our pictures , following us to our cars , taking down our licence plates and even following us home . "

Are You Being Served ?
star Mollie Sugden died yesterday , aged 86 .
The actress , best known for playing bluerinsed , innuendo - spouting Mrs Slocombe in the classic BBC sitcom , passed away following a long illness .
Sugden , who lived in Surrey , was married to fellow actor William Moore , who died nine years ago .
Her agent Joan Reddin said last night : " They were very much in love , she started to go down when he died .
" I represented her for more than 30 years and I was a very close friend .
She had had a long illness but it was very quick in the end .
Her twin boys were with her and she faded away .
She was a lovely , lovely person .
She was a great professional . "
Ms Reddin added that although Are You Being Served ? was her most famous show , Sugden was " too good " an actress to be remembered for comedy roles alone .
Frank Thornton , who played Captain Peacock in Are You Being Served ? , said : " Mollie was an excellent comedian .
If you can play comedy , you can play anything - you can play tragedy as well .
She was a jolly good actress . "
Born Mary Isobel Sugden in Keighley , West Yorks , in 1922 , she studied drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London .
It was in 1956 , while working for Swansea Rep at the Grand Theatre , that she met actor William , best - known for playing the longsuffering husband and father in Sorry !
They married in 1958 , when she was 35 and he was 39 .
Their twin sons Robin and Simon were born six years later , just as Sugden was becoming a familiar face on our screens .
In the 60s and 70s she played the formidable Mrs Hutchinson in The Liver Birds and was in Hugh And I , Please Sir ! and The Love Of Ada .
But it was as bossy sales lady Betty Slocombe at the Grace Brothers store in Are You Being Served ?
that she truly won the nation 's heart .
She later had her own slot on the consumer programme That 's Life .
Mollie found fame in the US in the 90s after re-runs of Are You Being Served ?
transformed her and co-star John Inman , famous for his catchphrase " I 'm free , " into cult figures there .
The Perseids occur when Earth passes through dusty material from a comet
Skygazers have observed a dazzling sky show , as the annual Perseid meteor shower reached its peak .
No special equipment was required to watch the shower , which occurs when Earth passes through a stream of dusty debris from the comet Swift - Tuttle .
Budding astronomers were advised to lie on a blanket or a reclining chair to get the best view .
But skygazers in the south of England were left disappointed as clouds spoiled their views of the spectacle .
" There are different times of the year when you can see meteor showers but August is normally the best time because that 's when the skies are clearest , " said a spokesman for the National Trust , which published a guide to the top sites to witness the event in England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
" Rural areas and wide open spaces are the best .
It 's just unfortunate that the southern part of Britain seems to have been shrouded in cloud . "
However , skygazers in northern England and Scotland were able to get a clearer view .
As the cometary " grit " from Swift - Tuttle strikes our atmosphere , it burns up , often creating streaks of light across the sky .
PERSEID METEOR SHOWER
The tails of the Perseids point back to a " radiant " in the constellation Perseus
They can appear anywhere in the sky Perseids consist of dusty debris from Comet Swift - Tuttle
The meteors appear to come from a point called a " radiant " in the constellation of Perseus - hence the name Perseid .
The late evening on 12 August through to the early hours of the 13 August was the best time to see the shower .
In North America , the best time to watch was before dawn on Wednesday .
Astronomers say up to 100 meteors per hour are expected to streak across the sky during the shower 's peak .
But this year , light from the last quarter Moon also interfered with viewing .
Astronomers say binoculars help to view the spectacle , but also restrict the view to a small part of the sky .
The Perseids can appear in any part of the sky , but their tails all point back to the radiant in the constellation Perseus .

Your pictures of the meteors Skywatchers took part in the first " Twitter Meteorwatch " .
People around the world " live - tweeted " images of the meteors , as well as pictures of the Moon , Jupiter and other celestial objects .
The " 48 - hour Twitter marathon " formed part of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 ( IYA2009 ) .
The rock and dust fragments which cause the shower were left behind by Comet Swift - Tuttle when it last came near the Sun .
The comet orbits the Sun once every 130 years and last swept through the inner Solar System in 1992 .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
At last week 's annual Jackson Hole meeting of Fed execs , Boss Ben Bernanke 's braggadocio about saving the world from another Great Depression had the feel of an egomaniacal dictator trying to cement his legacy in history .
Any good behaviorist would tell you Bernanke 's got some dangerous biases isolating him from reality ( remember two years ago when he was denying the meltdown ) .
His brash claims and radical , secretive policies present a grave danger to American capitalism and democracy .
In fact , Bernanke now appears to be America 's ( and the world 's ) most dangerous man , far more dangerous than Hank Paulson and the " Goldman Conspiracy " ever was .
He 's now acting like the supreme dictator of that larger conspiracy Jack Bogle called the " Happy Conspiracy " in " The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism : How the Financial System Undermined Social Ideals , Damaged Trust in the Markets , Robbed Investors of Trillions -- And What to Do About It . "
This indictment of Bernanke as a dictator leading Wall Street 's " Happy Conspiracy " became clear after reading " Dismantling the Temple , " William Greider 's brilliant essay in The Nation magazine .
Greider is the author of " Secrets of the Temple : How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country . "
Greider 's essay is an absolute must - read for anyone interested in the future of capitalism , the decline of democracy , the next mega- meltdown , and the real " Great Depression 2 " ... from which Bernanke cannot save us .
Why worry ?
Because the danger really is imminent .
The same clueless Congress that did nothing when Paulson and the Goldman Conspiracy nearly bankrupted America is now about to give Bernanke 's out - of - control " Happy Conspiracy " even more power , and another bigger chance to destroy our capitalism .
Here is a summary of Greider 's history about how the Fed is sabotaging America :
The Fed was created by Congress in 1913 , " independent " from " the rest of government , aloof from regular politics and with one powerful exception : the bankers . "
However , the destructive ideologies of Greenspan and Reaganomics prove how the Fed is manipulated by and dangerously dependent on politicians .
The Fed is " the black hole of our democracy -- the crucial contradiction . "
And the recent credit crisis blew " the Fed 's cover . "
Voters and taxpayers have no " voice in these most important public policies " because the Fed " operated in secrecy . "
" The past year , the Fed has flooded the streets with money , distributing trillions of dollars to banks , financial markets and commercial interests .
...
People and politicians are shocked ... confused ... angered . "
Where did the Fed get those trillions ?
They " printed it , out of thin air .
That is what central banks do .
Who told the Fed governors they could do this ?
Nobody , really -- not Congress or the president . "
The Fed " does not submit its budgets to Congress for authorization and appropriation .
It raises its own money , sets its own priorities , " keeps Congress and the American people in the dark .
Wall Street bankers own the Fed , it 's their private club .
They " collaborate closely on Fed policy .
Banks are the ' shareholders ' who ostensibly own the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks .
Bankers sit on the boards of directors , proposing interest - rate changes for Fed governors , " serve on a " special advisory council that meets privately with governors to critique monetary policy and management of the economy . "
The Fed 's a legal conspiracy making bankers very , very " happy . "
Congress is now " demanding greater transparency . "
Bernanke says " no , " an audit would amount to " a takeover of monetary policy by the Congress . "
What a dictator .
Greider quotes the Constitution : " The Congress shall have the power to coin money [ and ] regulate the value thereof . "
He adds that the Constitution " does not grant the president or the Treasury secretary this power .
Nor does it envision a secretive central bank " acting as a megaphone for a president 's political ideology .
Bernanke 's powers go far beyond anything Paulson demanded last year .
And he's now fighting a turf war because the " Happy Conspiracy " needs secrecy : no audits , no supervision , no transparency , no oversight , and zero accountability to taxpayers .
Why ?
That way they can steal from the American people at will .
Greider 's big warning : Recently Obama made a monumental mistake when he " proposed to make the central bank the supercop to guard against ' systemic risk ' and set its own regulations .
Obama 's proposal gives the central bank even greater power " but does " not propose any changes in the Fed 's privileged status . "
Giving the Fed more power to self - regulate in secrecy is a guaranteed set - up for a bigger mega- meltdown around 2013 , the Fed 's centennial anniversary .
Now is " a good time to dismantle the temple " warns Greider .
" Democratize the Fed .
Or tear it down .
Create something new in its place that 's accountable to the public . "
Here are his " six reasons why granting the Fed even more power is a really bad idea : "
1 . More power rewards failure , creating ' moral hazard '
Get it ?
Under Greenspan and now Bernanke the Fed has been a dismal failure : " Like the largest banks that have been bailed out , the Fed was a co-author of the destruction , " says Greider .
" During the past 25 years , it failed to protect the country against reckless banking and finance adventures , " blinded by the politics of Greenspan and Reaganomics .
" The Fed did not see this disaster coming ... did nothing to warn people . "
Or they did see it and let it happen , blinded by Wall Street 's greed .
2 . Fed policies will continue destabilizing U.S. and global economies
Under Greenspan and Bernanke the Fed has dangerously destabilized the American economy and global credit , stock and currency markets .
Greider warns : " Its extreme swings in monetary policy , combined with utter disregard for timely regulatory enforcement , steadily shifted economic rewards away from the real economy of production , work and wages and toward the financial realm , where profits and incomes were wildly inflated by false valuations " as " the Fed tilted in favor of capital over labor . "
3 . The Fed 's not objective , cannot investigate its own systemic flaws
Wall Street owns the Fed and has a monstrous conflict of interest .
Greider 's example : " The Fed served as midwife to Citigroup , the failed conglomerate now on government life support .
...
Now the Fed keeps Citigroup alive with a $ 300 billion loan guarantee , " protecting " the banking behemoths that it promoted , if only to cover its own mistakes . "
4 . The Fed can not be trusted to protect taxpayers against Wall Street
Rich Wall Street executives manage the Federal Reserve System .
Only a fool ( or a clueless Congress ) will ever trust the Fed to protect taxpayers .
The Fed needs independent oversight .
Congress needs to take back its constitutional responsibility .
5. More Fed power means more companies want ' too big to fail ' status
If Congress continues neglecting its constitutional responsibilities and gives Bernanke supreme dictatorial powers over the " Happy Conspiracy , " Greider says " a new superclass of 40 or 50 financial giants will emerge as the born - again ' money trust ' that citizens railed against 100 years ago .
But this time , it will be armed with a permanent line of credit from Washington .
The Fed , having restored and consolidated the battered Wall Street club will doubtless also shield " companies like GE " against failure . "
6 . The Fed will be a rich - man 's club dominating everything from the top
The Fed will " dominate everything from the top down " if Bernanke is anointed absolute dictator over the " Happy Conspiracy . "
Obama 's misguided proposal will " foster even greater concentration of financial power . "
Every " large company left out of the protected class will want to join by growing larger and acquiring the banking elements needed to qualify . "
And " most enterprises in banking and commerce will compete with the big boys at greater disadvantage , vulnerable to predatory power plays the Fed has implicitly blessed . "
If Congress is stupid enough to abdicate its constitutional powers to the Fed , God help America 's democracy .
And for capitalism , this will go down as the biggest blunder of Obama 's presidency , worse that Clinton 's dismantling of the Glass - Steagall Act .
And yet , Greider hints that the worst - case - scenario may be inevitable : " The obstacles to democratizing the Fed are obviously formidable .
Tampering with the temple is politically taboo .
But this crisis has demonstrated that the present arrangement no longer works for the public interest .
The society of 1913 no longer exists . "
Still , America " has a rare opportunity to reconstitute the Federal Reserve as a normal government agency , shorn of the bankers ' preferential trappings and the fallacious claim to ' independent ' status as well as the claustrophobic demand for secrecy . "
But unfortunately , " many in Congress will be afraid to take on the temple and reluctant to violate the taboo surrounding the Fed .
It will probably require popular rebellion . "
Why ?
Because Congress ( like the Fed ) dances to the bidding of Wall Street and its lobbyists who donate megabucks to their campaigns .
So do n't expect reform until the next crisis , a mega - meltdown around 2013 , the centennial anniversary of the Fed .
Till then , you 're on notice that the man most likely to destroy American capitalism is Ben Bernanke and his " Happy Conspiracy " of Wall Street bankers that own our Federal Reserve Banks .
The man has LIED about practically everything and now life comes turning FULL CIRCLE on him .
Emails and everything indicates that he was deeply involved in the firings of former U.S. Attorneys , especially former U.S. Attorney , David Igelsias , out of New Mexico .
It is all here .
Former White House political adviser Karl Rove was deeply involved in the firing of a U.S. attorney in New Mexico , according to White House e-mails and transcripts of closed - door testimony released Tuesday .
The House Judiciary Committee released more than 5,400 pages of White House and Republican National Committee e-mails , along with transcripts of closed - door testimony by Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers .
The documents show that staffers in Rove 's office were actively seeking to have U.S. Attorney David Iglesias removed .
In one e-mail in 2005 , Rove aide Scott Jennings sent an e-mail to another Rove aide , saying , " I would really like to move forward with getting rid of NM US ATTY . "
The ensuing uproar led to a series of damaging revelations about the Bush administration 's political meddling with the Justice Department and the eventual resignation of then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Iglesias said in an interview Tuesday he was nauseated by the whole affair .
" It 's exactly what I feared .
Over two years ago , I said that all roads lead to Rove , " Iglesias said .
" I 've said consistently that he was highly involved , and now the evidence is there . "
Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , did not immediately return a call for comment .
Miers was interviewed by House Judiciary Committee lawyers on June 15 .
Rove was interviewed July 7 and 30 .
A jail cell is waiting for Mr. Rove .
No wonder the Republicans , especially the Bush White House desperately needed a Republican back in the White House .
These emails are bomb shells .

He would have no money for war supplies .
No money to pay troops .
" We knew we could pull it off -- we had the tools , " said one senior official who worked at the Pentagon when the highly classified plan was developed .
But the attack never got the green light .
Bush administration officials worried that the effects would not be limited to Iraq but instead create worldwide financial havoc , spreading across the Middle East to Europe and perhaps to the United States .
Fears of such collateral damage are at the heart of the debate as the Obama administration and its Pentagon leadership struggle to develop rules and tactics for carrying out attacks in cyberspace .
While the Bush administration seriously studied computer - network attacks , the Obama administration is the first to elevate cybersecurity -- both defending American computer networks and attacking those of adversaries -- to the level of a White House director , whose appointment is expected in coming weeks .
But senior White House officials remain so concerned about the risks of unintended harm to civilians and damage to civilian infrastructure in an attack on computer networks that they decline any official comment on the topic .
And senior Defense Department officials and military officers directly involved in planning for the Pentagon 's new " cybercommand " acknowledge that the risk of collateral damage is one of their chief concerns .
" We are deeply concerned about the second - and third - order effects of certain types of computer network operations , as well as about laws of war that require attacks be proportional to the threat , " said one senior officer .
This officer , who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the work , also acknowledged that these concerns had restrained the military from carrying out a number of proposed missions .
" In some ways , we are self - deterred today because we really have n't answered that yet in the world of cyber , " the officer said .
In interviews over recent weeks , a number of current and retired White House officials , Pentagon civilians and military officers disclosed details of classified missions -- some only considered and some put into action -- that illustrate why this issue is so difficult .
Although the digital attack on Iraq 's financial system was not carried out , the American military and its partners in the intelligence agencies did receive approval to cripple Iraq 's military and government communications systems in the early hours of the war in 2003 .
And that attack did produce collateral damage .
Besides blowing up cell phone towers and communications grids , the offensive included electronic jamming and digital attacks against Iraq 's telephone networks .
American officials also contacted international communications companies that provided satellite phone and cell phone coverage to Iraq to alert them to possible jamming and to ask their assistance in turning off certain channels .
Officials now acknowledge that the communications offensive temporarily disrupted telephone service in countries around Iraq that shared its cell phone and satellite telephone systems .
That limited damage was deemed acceptable by the Bush administration .
Another such event took place in the late 1990s , according to a former military researcher .
The American military attacked a Serbian telecommunications network and accidentally affected the Intelsat satellite communications system , whose service was hampered for several days .
Echoing nuclear fears
These missions , which remain highly classified , are being scrutinized today as the Obama administration and the Pentagon move into new arenas of cyberoperations .
Few details have been reported previously ; mention of the proposal for a digital offensive against Iraq 's financial and banking systems appeared with little notice on Newsmax.com , a news Web site , in 2003 .
The government concerns evoke those at the dawn of the nuclear era , when questions of military effectiveness , legality , and morality were raised about radiation spreading to civilians far beyond any zone of combat .
" If you do n't know the consequences of a counterstrike against innocent third parties , it makes it very difficult to authorize one , " said James Lewis , a cyberwarfare specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
-- Herbert Lin , senior scientist at the National Research Council " It 's virtually certain that there will be unintended consequences ...
If you do n't know what a computer you attack is doing , you could do something bad . "
But some military strategists argue that these uncertainties have led to excess caution on the part of Pentagon planners .
" Policy makers are tremendously sensitive to collateral damage by virtual weapons , but not nearly sensitive enough to damage by kinetic " -- conventional - -" weapons , " said John Arquilla , an expert in military strategy at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , Calif .
" The cyberwarriors are held back by extremely restrictive rules of engagement . "
Despite analogies that have been drawn between biological weapons and cyberweapons , Arquilla argues that " cyberweapons are disruptive and not destructive . "
That view is challenged by some legal and technical experts .
" It 's virtually certain that there will be unintended consequences , " said Herbert Lin , a senior scientist at the National Research Council and author of a recent report on offensive cyberwarfare .
" If you do n't know what a computer you attack is doing , you could do something bad . "
Mark Seiden , a Silicon Valley computer security specialist who was a co-author of the National Research Council report , said , " The chances are very high that you will inevitably hit civilian targets -- the worst - case scenario is taking out a hospital which is sharing a network with some other agency .?
And while such attacks are unlikely to leave smoking craters , electronic attacks on communications networks and data centers could have broader , life - threatening consequences where power grids and critical infrastructure like water treatment plants are increasingly controlled by computer networks .
Over the centuries , rules governing combat have been drawn together in customary practice as well as official legal documents , like the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations charter .
These laws govern when it is legitimate to go to war , and set rules for how any conflict may be waged .
Two traditional military limits now are being applied to cyberwar : proportionality , which is a rule that , in layman 's terms , argues that if you slap me , I can not blow up your house ; and collateral damage , which requires militaries to limit civilian deaths and injuries .
" Cyberwar is problematic from the point of view of the laws of war , " said Jack L. Goldsmith , a professor at Harvard Law School .
" The U.N. charter basically says that a nation cannot use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other nation .
But what kinds of cyberattacks count as force is a hard question , because force is not clearly defined . "

Throughout her historic court battle , Debbie Purdy 's husband , violinist Omar Puente , has been by her side .
This is their inspiring story
Omar Puente remembers stepping out of Heathrow airport for the first time .
" The ground was white and it was cold .
It was like there was smoke coming out of my mouth when I spoke , " he said .
" I thought , ' Ooooh dear , this is going to be tough . '
I had no friends , no family and no money , but I had come because of Debbie . "
That was 1997 and Puente - a Cuban violinist - was to stick by Debbie Purdy in every year that followed , her constant support in a long battle to force the British government to clarify the law on assisted suicide .
Purdy , who has multiple sclerosis , wanted one thing : to know for certain that if her suffering became so bad that she chose to take her life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland , her husband would not be prosecuted for accompanying her .
On Thursday the 46 - year - old won a historic judgment from the House of Lords .
Afterwards , as she sat in her wheelchair smiling gleefully and telling journalists she was " ecstatic " , Puente knelt by her side in a smart black shirt watching her proudly .
" I am happy because Debbie is happy , " he said yesterday as he began eating breakfast at their Bradford home .
He smiled at Purdy who was lying on the couple 's double bed , placed downstairs when the house was converted to accommodate her wheelchair .
She was so exhausted from her trip to London she said she might stay there for 48 hours .
By her side , lying on the laminate floor , was one of her husband 's four violins .
Straight ahead French windows opened on to a small yard in which Purdy was growing strawberries and blueberries .
" We 'd call it a terrace if we were posh , " she said , giggling like a child .
Her husband laughed and said : " She feels more in control , she feels that she has her life back , and I am happy because of that .
She is a really strong woman and my mother was a really strong woman too . "
Puente was born in 1961 during the Cuban revolution .
His father was a doctor and his mother a nurse .
He began playing the violin at the age of eight and as a teenager moved to the capital to study at music school .
" My mother moved my entire family to Havana , " said Puente , laughing .
" She said , ' My boy is going to Havana so everybody is going to Havana ' . "
Soon he was playing all over the world .
One day while rehearsing in Singapore he was told that a music journalist called Debbie Purdy was to interview him .
" It was really tough to do the interview because my English was really , really , really , reaaaally bad , " said Puente , stretching his words expressively and describing Purdy 's white T - shirt and denim shorts .
" Her Spanish was zero and my English was 0.1 . "
Somehow the couple hit it off and began dating .
" I learned the words ' beautiful ' and ' honey ' and ' pretty ' but I could not really pronounce ' gorgeous ' , " said Puente , recalling their first days together .
It was in the weeks that followed that Purdy realised something was wrong .
She flew back to England and 15 days after her first doctor 's appointment was diagnosed with MS .
" She called me in tears and I told her to get on a plane and come here , " said Puente .
For months she travelled with the band from Manila to Malaysia to Indonesia .
Purdy said the band - and especially her boyfriend - never let her feel sorry for herself .
Once when she lost control of her bowels , Puente burst out laughing .
" I said , ' How can you laugh ? '
And he said , ' Either I 'll cry with you or I 'll laugh with you ' .
What could I say ?
" Terrible things happen to people all over the world - people have no water , food or education .
MS is n't really so bad - and the fact that I can have a wheelchair , that is a good thing . "
Purdy had loved to dance but by then she could barely manage it .
So Puente held her in his arms , with her feet balanced on his , and swung her around the dance floor .
The couple fell in love and when Purdy decided in 1997 that it was time to return home Puente went with her .
Life in Yorkshire was a major culture shock .
" In Latin America you have a big family and you open the windows because it is hot .
Here family is small and you close the windows because it is cold .
You drive on the left and at the beginning I felt like people just kept saying , ' Please , please , thank - you , thank - you , please , sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry ' , " said Puente , mimicking British politeness .
" But whether it was coincidence , luck or destiny , I began learning a lot , I began playing in new ways and now England is my second home . "
Puente 's experiences have been extraordinary .
At first when he turned up at jazz venues musicians laughed that he had a violin - to them it was a classical instrument .
But in time he joined in .
Over the years he has played with famous musicians including John Williams , Robert Mitchell and Jools Holland , and been asked to jam with Ruben Gonzalez , the Cuban pianist who was a member of the Buena Vista Social Club .
One day someone told Puente that Kirsty MacColl was to sing with his band and he replied " Kirsty MacWho ? " .
More was to come including collaborations with Courtney Pine , the jazz musician who has produced Puente 's first album , " From There to Here " .
It will be launched in November , and the pair will perform together in Scotland this week .
He hopes his work will help pay off debts he built up flying to and from Cuba .
In recent years Puente flew home every six weeks to visit his sick mother , who died last August at the age of 86 .
Talking about he possibility of one day assisting his wife in a suicide , he said : " All Debbie wanted was a safety net .
It is not as if she wants to go to Switzerland tomorrow .
I do n't want her to ever go , I want her to live hundreds and hundreds of years .
And I would have accompanied her whatever happened .
But we wanted clarity and at last , that is what we have . "
Two year battle
July 2007 : Solicitors Bindman 's begin to gather evidence from people who have accompanied relatives to Dignitas .
June 2008 : There is a high court hearing of Purdy 's case at the Royal Courts of Justice .
Purdy wants to know what would happen to her husband if he accompanies her to Zurich .
October 2008 : Purdy 's case is lost but the high court gives permission to take it to the court of appeal .
February 2009 : Court of appeal hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice .
Three judges rule that Purdy is not entitled to the type of guidance she seeks .
June 2009 : House of Lords hears Purdy 's case - its final sitting before making way for a supreme court .
July 2009 : The law lords rule in favour of Purdy .
But Lord Hope of Craighead says it is not their function to change the law - simply to demand that it be clarified .
Two teams of Chinese researchers working separately have reprogrammed mature skin cells of mice to an embryonic - like state and used the resulting cells to create live mouse offspring .
The reprogramming may bring scientists one step closer to creating medically useful stem - cell lines for treating human disease without having to resort to controversial laboratory techniques .
However , the advance poses fresh ethical challenges because the results could make it easier to create human clones and babies with specific genetic traits .

Clean , Easy Cool Tube Tutorial detailed or clean instructions on how to make a cool tube using a Pyrex bake - a- round .
They all ommited small details or used a ton of duct tape , random scraps , etc .
This is intended for those who want a durable , clean , easy to assemble piece of equipment for thier setup . )
Lemon 's Clean and Easy Cool Tube
This is a detailed tutorial on how to put together your very own cool tube .
You can assemble one of these in about 20 minutes .
This is based on a 150 watt HPS , but may be adapted as needed .
What You Need :
1 x Pyrex Bake - A - Round tube ( long discontinued , but available readily on EBay and in classifieds , Flea markets etc – surprisingly common ) - $ 10-15
1 x pair of Café Rod brackets ( hardware store , where window fittings are located ) - $ 1.50
1 x Ceramic medium or mogul lamp base with standard mounting hole - $ 0.99
1 x 1 ” - 1.5 ” ( approx ) hose clamp - $ 0.80
1 x 3.5 ” - 4 ” ( approx ) hose clamp - $ 1.00
2 x 4.5 ” - 5 ” ( approx ) hose clamps - $ 2.50
1 x roll of self adhesive insulting foam for hot water pipes .
- $ 2.50
1 x # 6 – 32 x 3/8 ” ( machine screws with nuts ) - $ 0.99
1 x multipurpose ( including glass ) glue or epoxy ( optional ) - $ 3.00
1 x 400 °F small tube of silicone sealant - $ 2.50
Your HPS / 4 ” duct system – N / A
Step 1 :
Collect your café rod brackets , lamp base , and screws .
Remove one of the café rods and bend into roughly the shape illustrated in the next photo ( you may need a something to help such as a pair of pliers ) .
Attach the café rod to the lamp socket ’s mounting hole using a screw and nut .
Connect the wires from your power source line to the lamp socket .
The white wire should connect to the silver screw , and the black wire to the brass / darker screw ( this is standard color coding ) .
I used a little bit of solder for good measure .
Leave the ground wire ( green ) unconnected for now , ideally left a little longer than the others .
Cut and bend the remaining café rod into three pieces with tabs on the end as shown .
The longest / middle section should measure 1&1/8 ” on each ( medium ) or 7/8 " ( mogul ) .
The other sections are of negligible length , but around ½ ” is good .
These are your spacers .
Fasten the spacers to the lamp socket as shown .
Use your epoxy or glue if desired in addition to the clamp to make sure everything is firmly in place .
Step 2 :
Hang your bulb assembly over the end of the Bake - a - Round .
You will notice that there is a slight bit of play between the spacers attached to the socket , and the inner walls of the tube ( if you measured correctly and do n’t have an oddly sized socket ) .
This is deliberate and is to account for possible thermal expansion in the metal .
Fitting the spacers firmly could result in a cracked or broken tube !
Place the bulb in the socket and clamp the hook hanging over the side of the glass tube with the ~ 4 ” Clamp .
Tack the hook and clamp with epoxy / glue for added strength ( The glued clamp can still be popped off , so do n’t worry too much about how you will change the bulb ) .
Step 3 :
Wrap self adhesive insulating foam around each end on the tube as shown ( or only one if you are using exhaust only ) .
This will allow 4 ” duct to fit very snugly to the tube ( which it ’s self is 3 ¾ ” O.D. ) , and will also act as a gasket / seal when clamped .
Thread wiring through the ducting , attach the ducting to the tube , and clamp in place .
Finish with silicone sealant if desired .
Connect the ground to the duct or the café rod hook .
Add an optional reflector made from unclosed rigid duct ( you can find this in your hardware store – it ’s a piece of sheet metal with a snap together seam that has n’t been connected ) .
Simply cut to length , cut flanges a half inch from the ends , and clamp those to the duct / tube .
Hang your lamp with light chain available from your hardware store by the foot .
The chain attaches under the clamps on the duct .
You ’re done !
The End

Announcing the new Haskell Prime process , and Haskell 2010
At last year 's Haskell Symposium , it was announced that we would change the Haskell Prime process to make it less monolithic .
Since then , everyone has been busy using Haskell ( or implementing it ) , and we have n't made much progress on the standardisation side of things .
Well , with ICFP and the Haskell Symposium approaching we felt it was time to get the new process moving and hopefully produce a language revision this year .
I 've updated the Haskell ' wiki with the new information ; in particular the process is documented here : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/Process
We 're aiming to announce the list of accepted proposals at the Haskell Symposium this year .
However , owing to the short timescale , the list is going to be correspondingly short , and limited to extensions which are either already fully specified ( i.e. the FFI ) or are small and well - understood .
The following list is very provisional ; we 'll be making the final decisions next month .
ForeignFunctionInterface LineCommentSyntax PatternGuards DoAndIfThenElse
Remove n+k patterns RelaxedDependencyAnalysis EmptyDataDeclarations HierarchicalModules NonDecreasingIndentation remove FixityResolution from the context - free grammar change the syntax of QualifiedOperators
In the coming weeks we 'll be refining proposals in preparation for Haskell 2010 .
By all means suggest more possibilities ; however note that as per the new process , a proposal must be " complete " ( i.e. in the form of an addendum ) in order to be a candidate for acceptance .
I have updated the status page http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/Status marking everything except the proposals that have been already implemented in the draft Report as " old " .
The new process requires a proposal to have an owner or owners in order to make progress ; once a proposal has an owner it will move into the " under discussion " state .
To take up ownership of an existing proposal , or to start a new proposal , ask on the mailing list .
There are other ways you can get involved ; some suggestions are on the Haskell ' main page : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki
( hmm , I suppose we should fix that logo too ... )
Cheers , Simon

Because a video showing Israelis calling Barack Obama a ‘ fucking nigger ’ after his Cairo speech can be censored by the Huffington Post because it is n’t ‘ news ’ , but this is :

Six days after September 11th , National Geographic Today ( NGT ) published one of the very first descriptions of the official myth for what happened to the World Trade Center ( WTC ) towers .
[1 ]
This article exaggerated the little known facts about the fires in the towers , equated gas temperatures with steel temperatures , and detailed the long - surviving but incorrect Pancake Theory of “ collapse . ”
Since that time , millions of people have been killed or injured in the 9/11 Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that originated from the official myth about 9/11 .
[ 2,3 ]
Fortunately , this week it was announced that the NGT ’s parent , the National Geographic Channel ( NG Channel ) , is scheduled to broadcast a new television special covering the science behind the events of 9/11 .
We can only assume that this new show is meant to correct the record and apologize for the company ’s false statements that contributed to the ongoing wars .
Some of the false statements made in that NGT article had to do with an early version of the Pancake Theory for destruction of the buildings .
One claim was :
“ As the steel columns at the core of the Twin Towers collapsed , the floors they supported fell on each other like two stacks of pancakes . ”
Another statement was more authoritative , saying : “ Once the structural support of the upper floors is removed , a few falling floors can bring down an entire building . ”
The Pancake Theory did not make sense to many people but was tested by my former employer , Underwriters Laboratories ( UL ) , in August 2004 .
The tests showed that the floors in the WTC buildings could not have pancaked , even when exposed to higher temperatures for longer periods of time than was actually the case .
Two years later , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) finally made clear that its “ findings do not support the ‘ pancake theory ’ of collapse . ” [ 4 ]
To date , there have been no apologies from any of the media sources that , oftentimes arrogantly , promoted the Pancake Theory as a means to prevent further questioning of the WTC events .
But we all know that “ National Geographic ” is different , right ?
Actually , some people are unaware that the NG Channel is majority controlled ( 67 % ) by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation .
[ 5 ]
The National Geographic Society , publisher of the well - known magazine , was a minority partner in creation of the NG Channel , but does not have editorial control over what is produced there .
Instead , the News Corporation controls the programming much like it controls Fox News .
In the early article promoting the WTC myth , NGT described how “ Jet fuel fires burn unusually hot , and engineers believe the fire may have led to temperatures as high as 1,600 degrees Celsius ( 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit ) . ”
But the truth is that the jet fuel fires at the WTC , which lasted a total of 79 seconds by one expert estimate , and lasted only a few minutes according to NIST , would have been cooler than the later fires fed by office furnishings alone . [ 6 ]
It has since been admitted by NIST that gas temperatures reached only “ as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius . ” [ 7 ]
With that in mind , it ’s important to note that in a structure fire , the temperature of fireproofed steel lags far behind the temperature of the air ( i.e. gas ) in the vicinity .
In fact , even in a testing furnace where heat cannot be conducted away , when the temperature of the furnace is raised to 1000 °C and held at that temperature , it takes two full hours for the protected steel within to reach 600 °C . [ 8 ]
Neither of the Twin Towers remained standing for two hours after aircraft impact , however , and that ’s why NIST evaluated a fireproofing loss scenario for the towers .
NIST suggested fireproofing loss through a mechanism of shotgun - like blasts , presumably formed from aircraft debris and aimed in all directions throughout the areas where the planes impacted .
Fortunately , in the 1.5 - second long video produced by Purdue University , and featured on the website for the new television special , this shotgun scenario is shown to be in direct contradiction to the large - scale debris field produced by the aircraft .
Apart from this one valuable refutation of NIST , however , the micro video from Purdue has been shown to be a poor representation of what actually happened at the WTC . [ 9 ]
Hopefully the apology from the NG Channel will include an interview with Purdue President France Córdova , who can help to clarify these facts .
That is , if she ’s not tied up in another SAIC board meeting . [ 10 ]
The website for the new television show also suggests that the NG Channel ’s apology will be offered directly by the Turkish professor Mete Sözen , a long - time supporter of government myths about terrorism . [ 11 ]
Sözen is not just a professor at Purdue but was a leader of the FEMA investigation into what happened at the Pentagon on 9/11 .
He was also the director of the Department of Defense ’s Blast Mitigation for Structures program , and is therefore another example of the many explosives experts that came up with only non-explosive stories for what happened on 9/11 . [ 12 ]
When Sözen is done helping with the apology from the NG Channel , he might , as a prominent Turkish person in the US , be able to help clarify the recent claim that some of our government representatives maintained “ intimate relations ” with al Qaeda , through Turkish proxies , right up until 9/11 . [ 13 ]
In any case , it will be a relief to not see another lame hit piece about 9/11 questions that relies solely on Brent Blanchard for testimony about demolition techniques .
As a photographer for “ Implosion World , ” Blanchard is often consulted for these tabloid programs when a “ demolition expert ” is needed .
But no evidence has ever been given that the real experts allow photographers to plan and implement their high - rise demolitions .
Hopefully , the NG Channel will feature interviews with experts who actually have planned and implemented such operations , like Danny Jowenko , who stated that WTC 7 was a demolition . [ 14 ]
The NG Channel ’s apology will certainly cover the other false claim in its NGT article , that : “ At temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius , steel loses its strength and ‘ turns to Play - doh . ’ ”
By exaggerating the gas temperatures and then hitting us with the “ Play - doh ” steel claim , the article falsely equated gas temperatures and steel temperatures in a structure fire .
But anyone can see from photographs and videos that the buildings did not turn to “ Play - doh ” as if they were experiencing an overall softening .
To the contrary , the towers behaved as if they were rigid structures , suddenly exploding outward and otherwise falling – at nearly free - fall speed -- through what should have been the path of most resistance . [ 15 ]
Additionally , tests done by NIST indicated that only 2 % of the steel samples saved had experienced temperatures as high as 250 °C , and steel is barely affected at all at such low temperatures .
The WTC steel temperature issue is complicated by the fact that the samples saved for the NIST investigation were pulled by John Gross , an investigator who has since been clearly deceptive when speaking about the evidence .
Gross specifically selected the steel samples that were saved , from what was said to be the areas of greatest heat exposure .
It ’s possible that Gross erred in his sample selection process , however , because in 2006 , he was publicly asked about molten metal at the WTC site , and he claimed that there was no evidence of molten metal . [ 16 ]
The truth is that there were many witnesses to molten metal at the WTC site , as well as photos that showed molten metal pouring from one of the towers before it fell . [ 17 ]
Since that time , scientific experiments have shown that extremely high temperatures existed at the WTC .
Other peer - reviewed articles demonstrate that the environmental data at Ground Zero indicate the presence of energetic materials , and that residues of such materials are present throughout the WTC dust . [ 18,19 ]
This strong evidence supports the many witnesses to explosions and the photographic evidence of demolition at the WTC .
Furthermore , it has been shown through an extensive peer - reviewed study that unexploded nanothermite is present in the WTC dust . [ 20 ]
It appears that the nanothermite materials present in the WTC dust are similar to the “ explosive aerogels ” made by US national laboratories for the past ten to fifteen years . [ 21 ]
All of this was explained in detail to the producer of the National Geographic Channel show long before his production ended , so it will be great to see it all communicated honestly .
The technical details should not be difficult , considering that the NG Channel produced a show on aerogels before . [ 22 ]
But what 's more , my colleagues and I have communicated directly with Robert Erickson , the producer of the show , and made sure he had all the information he needed on nanothermite and its explosive properties .
Erickson was confused at first , in that he had contacted the folks at Los Alamos National Laboratories ( LANL ) , and was forced to conclude that LANL ’s only exposure to nanothermite ( also called super - thermite ) technology was a recent , poorly received commercial venture .
He wrote -- “ Their work on nano - thermite was patented in 2005 – the theory of nano - thermite was in play by their scientists no earlier than 2004 . ” [ 23 ]
But the truth is that LANL had its own “ Super - Thermite Program ” years before 2004 , and before 9/11 . [ 24 ]
It must be that the scientists Erickson talked to were way out of the loop , or were lying to him for some reason , because we all trust that “ National Geographic ” would not engage in deceiving the public .
In any case , it is Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories ( LLNL ) that has been widely reported to be the leader in nanothermite research .
Unfortunately , Erickson could not contact LLNL because , as he wrote : “ My budget does not provide funds for me to travel to Livermore labs .
I just have a small television production to deal with . ”
This was a strange thing to say considering that North Hollywood , CA , where Erickson ’s company is located , is much closer to Livermore , CA than it is to Thibodoux , Louisiana , where Erickson traveled to shoot an example , illustrative demolition event .
Erickson went on to despair about the subject , stating -- “ And apparently – even if I ’m willing to look ...
No nano - thermite is available . ” [ 25 ]
This statement is reminiscent of NIST ’s reply when questioned as to why it did not test for explosive residues at the WTC ( i.e. why would you look for something that ’s not there ? ) .
But it ’s possible that Erickson ’s pessimism was correct , and that even if he was “ willing to look ” , he would not be able to share what he found .
That ’s what we heard from BBC producer Mike Rudin -- that LLNL scientists would not cooperate with his “ Conspiracy Files ” video production .
Rudin told us that LLNL refused to allow the BBC to use of any of the photographs of nanothermite materials that were readily available on the web .
That seems at odds with the idea that science can so easily disprove the demolition theory .
But I did give Erickson permission to use my own photos of nanothermite formulations that had been ignited .
Interestingly enough , these looked surprisingly similar to many of the red chip - like materials found in WTC dust samples , and both had attached metallic microspheres . [ 26 ]
Although he did not respond to this invitation , I ’m sure Erickson was excited to have these resources available for the show .
Some months earlier , Erickson ’s assistant , Dieu Pham , had contacted me several times to set - up an interview in Bloomington because other 9/11 investigators had recommended they do so .
At the time I told them that I would be glad to , and that also – “ My advice to you is to contact the 9/11 victim 's family members who were responsible for initiating both the 9/11 Commission and the NIST WTC investigation , if you have not done so already . ” [ 27 ]
Most people know that the WTC issue is only a small part of the incredible amount of evidence showing that the official myth of 9/11 is false .
In this televised apology , it will be good to see the interviews they did with victim ’s families , and how they handled the conflicts of interest within the 9/11 Commission , the insider trading , the air defense failures , the behavior of the Secret Service , and the many other anomalies of 9/11 .
In the end , the show 's producers suddenly changed their minds about interviewing me .
Dieu Pham wrote back saying – “ I was pushing to go there , but it just was n't working . ”
Who knows – maybe they finally drove up to Livermore , or the photos I provided gave the final touch needed to round out this science - based program .
No matter , just knowing that an apology is forthcoming is enough for me .
It wo n’t right the wrong entirely , as the death and destruction caused by the false stories about 9/11 cannot be undone .
But thanks to the National Geographic Channel in advance , for finally rejecting the trashy tabloid hit pieces of the past , and for being professional and caring enough to admit its many mistakes in reporting on the events of 9/11 .

Now a days usb devices are common .
USB flash drives , Card reader , hard drives and so on to make our life easy .
But they have a negative side also which is spreading Viruses .
All over the world ( specially in Pakistan and India ) USB devices are the source of spreading viruses .
Even antivirus software 's are unable to stop and remove them ( e.g Symantec ) .
These virus are real headache .
They disable Task Manger , Folder Options , Regedit , run command etc .
So there is a need for such type of software which can stop these .
So I brought a software for you .
USB Firewall blocks all virus and other willful programs that try to spread in your system when an USB device is inserted .

Before he became President George W. Bush ’s Treasury secretary in 2006 , Henry M. Paulson Jr. agreed to hold himself to a higher ethical standard than his predecessors .
He not only sold all his holdings in Goldman Sachs , the investment bank he had run , but also specifically said that he would avoid any substantive interaction with Goldman executives for his entire term unless he first obtained an ethics waiver from the government .
But today , seven months after Mr. Paulson left office , questions are still being asked about his part in decisions last fall to prop up the teetering financial system with tens of billions of taxpayer dollars , including aid that directly benefited his former firm .
Testifying on Capitol Hill last month , he was grilled about his relationship with Goldman .
“ Is it possible that there ’s so much conflict of interest here that all you folks do n’t even realize that you ’re helping people that you ’re associated with ? ” Representative Cliff Stearns , Republican of Florida , asked Mr. Paulson at the July 16 hearing .
“ I operated very consistently within the ethic guidelines I had as secretary of the Treasury , ” Mr. Paulson responded , adding that he asked for an ethics waiver for his interactions with his old firm “ when it became clear that we had some very significant issues with Goldman Sachs . ”
PopCap finally made official its plans to take Plants vs. Zombies to other platforms by revealing that the tower , or rather , lawn defense game will be heading to Xbox Live Arcade .
I really do n't see any reason why , if you 've been interested in PopCap 's most excellent Plants vs. Zombies and own a PC or Mac that was built sometime in the last decade , you have n't played the game yet .
But no matter .
If you were waiting for Plants vs. Zombies to come to different platforms , PopCap has good news for you .
Plants vs. Zombies is in development for XBLA , the company confirmed at the Casual Connect conference yesterday .
That 's about as far as the good news goes , however .
The company does n't have " any other details " as far as basically anything else goes , PopCap 's Cathy Orr told us .
No release window , nothing about new content , nada .
But I imagine that it 'll be essentially the same game with maybe some added goodies - as long as you 're getting the same PvZ experience , I can't see gamers being disappointed .
As for whether it 'll make it to other platforms , well , that 's an unknown , but I 'm sure it'd make sense for the company .
Speaking specifically for mobile phones , PopCap 's Garth Chouteau said earlier this month that he does n't " think you 'll see Plants vs. Zombies on a mobile phone .
I think you may see it on the iPhone ... some of our games , we would just say , ' you know ?
We could probably sell a million of these , but people are n't going to be happy with it . "
I can see that being true for phones in general , but this game would be absolutely perfect on the iPhone .
Here this article brings you some major differences between unmanaged hosting and managed to host .
Hope these differences helps you to understand which hosting is a right choice for your business .
But before this , let ’s see a concept of unmanaged hosting and managed hosting .
Unmanaged Hosting
As the name suggests , this kind of hosting is not managed by others for you .
From start to end , everything needs to take care of you .
Here , a web hosting provider rents you a server and entire responsibility of handling of server and keep your site up , falls on you , whether you have the technical expertise or not .
Managed Hosting
It is simply reverse of above .
Here , a provider takes the complete responsibility of managing your server .
Their team of professionals monitored your server for 24 * 7 and 365 days to keep your site up and perform well .
Their customer support is readily available to support you any time of the day .
Now here presents some basic differences which assist you to make right choice for your business .
1. Security
Managed hosting handle issues related to security well .
Providers offers tools by which viruses are scan , spams are filter , security audits run , software firewalls are configured and OS updates offered and in unmanaged hosting , you have to take care of all this .
2. Backups
In managed hosting , providers offers proper back up of data , as this is detrimental for you but in unmanaged hosting , all depends on you .
3. Monitoring of Server
In managed hosting , System admin monitor your servers for 24 * 7 to make network available for your clients all the time but in unmanaged hosting , you need some technical expertise to handle this , as a common man do n’t understand servers and their handling session .
4. Storage and Database management
In managed hosting , system admin manage storage needs of your site so that space is properly utilised and scaled thereby saving some money , and database admin design database as per your need and manage the same .
But on the other hand , in unmanaged , you need to manage both on your own basis or hire these professionals .
5 . Time is precious
As time is very precious for small as well as for large business owners , so if they spend the same to focus on strategies and ways for growing their business , their time will be better utilized .
And instead of this , if they spend their time on looking and handling servers for all day , they will be in a big trouble .
So , it ’s better if we used services of managed hosting , as this part will be handled by their professionals in a proper manner and saves us time .
6. Cost -Effective
Managed hosting is more expensive then unmanaged hosting .
As its services include many things , so obviously , it will be more costly to you but if you cannot afford , then opt for fully managed hosting solution .
Providers offer various plans in managed hosting , so before selecting the one , go through their features , support , price and other relevant factors , surely you choose the right plan .
7 . Meets your specific business needs
In Managed hosting plan , experts offers you solutions by which your specific business needs can be meet in the best possible way and in your budget too .
But unfortunately , in unmanaged hosting , no experts are available , its only you .
Conclusion
I hope you understand the differences between these two kinds of hosting .
It is clearly defined , managed hosting is better in almost each and every way than unmanaged hosting .
So , now surely you can make the right choice for your business .

Smash the OLIGARHY !
Created : August 28 , 2009 09:28 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Aug. 27 , 2009 episode of “ Glenn Beck ” on Fox News was television beyond description .
I ’ll just focus on the closing segment .
Beck , having spent four days scrawling the connection between radical groups and the Obama administration on a chalkboard , lines them up :
Obama
Left
International
Graft
ACORN - style organizations
Revolutionaries
Hidden Agendas
“ They all select their words first ! ” says Beck .
“ And then they tie them together into one word ! ”
He pauses .
“ One letter is missing . ”
At this point , the viewer realizes that the letter “ C ” is missing from the world “ OLIGARCH . ”
But no !
Beck scrawls out a “ Y . ” And tomorrow , he promises viewers a “ plan of action ” against these people , step one , we presume , being branding them with this name : The OLIGARHY .

Dolphin speak relies on brevity
Humans are n't the species that strive for efficiency when communicating , with a new study finding dolphins do it too .
It 's the first evidence that another species follows one of the basic rules that defines all human languages : the law of brevity .
The work , which is just one step in a larger attempt to understand the evolution of communication , also suggests that humans might not be as special as we like to think we are .
" Indirectly , this is telling us something about us , " says Dr David Lusseau , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Aberdeen , in Scotland .
" More broadly , it is helping us understand how you get to this level of complexity .
Is there only a limited way to reach it or can you reach it in many different manners ? "
In their long - term quest to understand how complex communication systems developed , Lusseau and colleague Ramon Ferrer - i- Cancho chose to study dolphins because the animals are far removed from humans on the evolutionary tree .
They diverged from us 65 million years ago , and their brains are built differently from ours .
At the same time , dolphins are known to communicate with a repertoire of about 30 non-vocal behaviors .
For example , when one dolphin performs a side flip or a series of side flips , for example , the rest of the group stops what it 's doing and moves on to something else .
Scientists are n't sure if the side - flipper is expressing a desire or an order .
Still , the message gets across .
Counting movements
The researchers broke down each of these 30 behaviors into individual units .
A side flip , for example , requires a dolphin to jump and land on its side - for a total of two behavioral units .
Head butting takes four units , as two individuals jump , hit and use their heads .
A simple turn involves just one unit , so does a forced blow of air out of a partially closed blowhole .
After hundreds of hours of observation and analyses , the scientists concluded that dolphins perform simple , one - move behaviors more often than complicated , multi-faceted actions .
Scientists call this phenomenon the ' law of brevity ' , and it exists in all human languages .
" The more you 're going to have to say something , the shorter you want it to be so you can diminish the amount of time it takes you to communicate , " says Lusseau , who is also looking for other types of similarities between human and dolphin communication systems .
" The listener is trying to make the least effort possible to understand what is said to him or her , " he says .
" The speaker is trying to make the least effort possible to communicate . "
Not unique
Until now , scientists had never documented the law of brevity in another species , but research behaviorist Dr Brenda McCowan suspects that dolphins and humans are n't the only ones who use it .
Systems of communication , she says , might simply need to be structured in certain ways in order to work .
" This work contributes to the growing body of data that humans are not as unique as once thought and that we have profound similarities in our behavior and communication with other animals , " says McCowan , of the University of California , Davis .
" Among other compelling data that support how profoundly similar we are to other animals , " she says .
The new study " should provoke us to think about our relationship with other animals and their place in society . "
The birthers , faced with the factual evidence as submitted by the state of Hawaii , witnesses , hospital workers , family and friends and faced with the actual birth certificate itself , still claim to believe that President Obama is n't really a U.S. citizen .
Faced with overwhelming evidence that proves that Obama was born in the United States , the birthers still are n't satisfied .
There have always been people unhappy with the outcome of presidential elections .
But since the election of the first African American president , President Obama , there has been a small but increasingly vitriolic segment of the population that appears to genuinely feel hatred towards our new president .
Historically , presidents have borne a great deal of criticism by the opposition party and to some degree at least , we expect this sort of thing .
But the criticism aimed at President Obama has crossed the line of expected criticism by the opposition and has spawned the birther movement .
In a town meeting in Delaware earlier this summer , Congressman Castle , ( R ) , Delaware , began taking questions from the audience .
A woman stood up with a plastic bag and an American flag clutched in her hand and accused Republican Congressman Castle of being part of the conspiracy that is covering up the president 's birth status .
The woman all but wept with anger .
She talked about how her father had fought in WWII to protect our country and ended her emotional speech by shouting that she wanted her country back .
Several people in the audience clapped and shouted in support of the woman .
When Congressman Castle stated that Obama is a citizen of the United States , he was booed .
Now it turns out that the loud ' birther ' lady is a local psychic named Eileen who is a regular caller to local talk radio in Delaware .
WGMD Radio talk show host Jared Morris posted a video on YouTube with a clip from one of Eileen 's calls to the radio station .
The evidence of President Obama 's birth in Hawaii is overwhelming and undisputed by all but the small number of persistent people who choose to ignore facts and evidence like the woman in the video you just watched .
When the people known as birthers , people such as the woman in Delaware , refuse to accept factual evidence , and continue to disrupt and provoke the public discourse with accusations that have been soundly debunked , one must then contemplate what it is that birthers are really upset about .
What is so different about President Obama that this difference has generated an entire movement based on a conspiracy that has been debunked numerous times ?
What is so different about President Obama from previous presidents that makes a woman stand up during a town meeting and accuse the former governor of the state , a Republican congressman , of being part of a massive coverup ?
What is so different about President Obama from previous presidents is his ancestry .
He is an American citizen but his father is Kenyan , his mother Kansan .
President Obama is an African American .
It seems abundantly clear that it is President Obama 's ancestry that is at the heart of the warrantless birther movement .
There is simply no other explanation that makes any sense .
Occam 's razor is a principle attributed to a 14th century Franciscan friar that in its simplest form states that " when you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions , the simpler one is the better .
&q
Occam 's razor is applied to logic in philosophy and science .
The simplest explanation for something is almost always the correct explanation .
Conspiracy theories can be exciting and generate passion but they are unrealistic .
For a conspiracy to be successful , a large number of people have to agree to withhold information , withhold the truth for an unlimited amount of time , in other words , a lot of people must agree to keep a big secret .
For example , there is a small segment of the population who genuinely believe the lunar landing was nothing more than a hoax .
To fake the moon landing in 1969 , all of the people who worked at Mission Control in Houston would have had to have agreed to participate in the hoax and never reveal the truth .
All of the astronauts and all of their families would have also had to have agreed to go along with the invented story .
So the first and most obvious problem with conspiracy ' theories ' is that a large number of people would have to be involved in keeping a great big secret .
There are other problems with conspiracy theories .
What would be the purpose of thousands of people participating in a massive hoax such as mankind landing on the moon ?
The idea that there are hundreds of people , perhaps thousands of people who have agreed to keep the secret that the president of the United States is not really an American citizen , is not merely illogical , it 's absurd .
And so there must be some other reason for the passionate hatred by people like the woman in Delaware .
If we apply the principle of Occam 's razor to the birther movement , the logical conclusion is that President Obama 's race is the reason for such passionate hatred .
it is the one thing that makes him very different from every other president that has come before him .
A majority of Americans voted for an African American man for president but that does n't mean that racism no longer exists in the United States .
The issue of race has all but disappeared from the public discourse but racism may be what has spawned the birther movement .
The embittered remarks by people like the woman in Delaware conveniently obfuscate what is really bothering the birthers .
It is unfortunate that the mainstream media network CNN has allowed one of its ' anchors ' to lend credibility to the racist birthers by perpetuating the myth that the issue of President Obama 's proof of birth in Hawaii has n't been resolved .
Lou Dobbs is encouraging the racist birthers to continue the charade that there is some sort of conspiracy regarding President Obama 's legitimacy as an American citizen .
In fact , he used the provocative term " undocumented " on his radio show to describe the question of President Obama 's birth certificate intimating that President Obama is like an illegal alien .
Here is more about Lou Dobbs and the birthers .
It is much easier to say you hate someone because they are not a citizen of the United States than it is to admit that you hate someone because you are a racist .
The easily disprovable notion that President Obama is n't really a natural born citizen of the united States is most likely founded in racism .
Ramen is some good eating .
Some ramen is better than other ramen .
All Japanese ramen is better than that crap that passed for ramen back in the States ( which I used to love but now would n’t even give to my dog if he sat at my foot panting for it . )
And , yes , I too have my favorites .
As far as Yokohama is concerned I can recommend two places .
1- First and foremost , I must recommend my favorite all - time Ramen spot .
It ’s called Yoshimura - ya and it ’s located about 10 minutes from Yokohama Station .
If you know the area , walk from the station past Vivre , past Tokyu Hands , and turn the corner .
You ca n’t miss it .
It would be the Ramen Ya with the benches out front filled with eager future patrons waiting upwards of 30 minutes outdoors just to get at the delectable dishes within .
Yes , the lines can get pretty daggone long .
But , I assure you , it is worth the wait .
The flavor is worthy of the hype .
There ’s a whole crew of guys slaving over meats and veggies .
Usually , watching how food is prepared for a cluster of people is not an especially pretty sight .
When I was in the Army and drew kitchen duty the experience almost turned me off to eating altogether .
I mean , watching some guy stir 100 pounds of pork in a roiling vat of grease , watching pink turn to gray , is not very appetizing .
But , watching these guys do it , with all the zeal and professionalism of their trade , is another story .
1500 customers come through this place a day ( and most of them seem to be waiting whenever I come here for some reason ) and they relish the business in typical Japanese style .
And then there ’s the final result :
Oishi sou dayo ne .
I have what is known in Japan as Nekoshita .
Nekoshita means a cat ’s tongue or a sensitive tongue .
So Japanese - style slurping is not something I can do easily .
Sometimes I still have to blow first .
But , nothing , least of all a slightly stinging tongue , can stop me from digging into some Yoshimura Ramen .
2- Okurayama ’s Nanashi Ramen Shop :
It ’s across from the Okurayama station on the Tokyu Tohoku line .
Though the larger - than - life sign out front screams , “ RAMEN ! ” at pedestrians , it ’s a small place and if you blink you might miss it … so do n’t blink .
Because if you do you ’ll miss out on one of the tastiest ramens you ’ll ever have the pleasure of slurping .
If you ’re wondering , Yep , it ’ s as good as it looks .
I ’ve been coming here maybe twice a month for the past two years or so and it has n’t let me down , yet .
You can expect to leave here 1500 yen lighter ( which is a little steep for ramen and a brew ) but I ’ve never felt bilked .
Also on the menu is some great gyouza and their rice side dish ( donburi ) is all that .
If you ’re in the area try them both out when you get a chance .
You ’ll be glad you did .
Tell them Loco sent you …just for fun (-;
Ramen : one of those little things …

How To Avoid O - Abuse and Bribes
An experimental approach to asymptotic analysis
Bob Sedgewick is an expert on the analysis of algorithms–one of the best in the world .
This is not too surprising since he is a PhD student of Donald Knuth , who coined the term analysis of algorithms .
Bob is also famous for his textbooks on algorithms and more recently his monograph on the analysis of algorithms with Philippe Flajolet .
The last is a required book for anyone trying to understand the performance of an algorithm .
Today ’s post is on the potential for abuse with the famous notation .
I have posted on this already twice .
Twice .
I think that it is a serious issue , and that Bob has a simple but powerful “ solution ” .
I have many stories about Bob .
One of the strangest is the time that we were offered a bribe .
For the record we did not take the bribe–although the statute of limitations is probably long run out on us .
Also for the record the bribe offer was very smooth , so we could be wrong–no it was a bribe offer .
At the time Bob was the chair of the department of computer science at Princeton .
For a variety of reasons there was a mathematician , we will call X , that was not going to be kept on at the Princeton mathematics department .
This department is perhaps the best in the world , so that should not come as a shock .
The complication is that X was sort of a computer scientist .
For reasons that I did not understand then , nor do I understand now , there were people in the political world that really wanted X to stay at Princeton .
Powerful people .
So far fine .
It ’s nice to have friends in high places .
The trouble began when Bob was “ asked ” to a meeting with them .
I was brought along for support , and it turned out that was a good idea .
The meeting was strange .
They spoke highly of X .
We agreed and said that we had a mechanism for hiring faculty .
For starters , X should send us a resume , which would start the hiring review process .
They nodded , but said why could we not just hire X . Bob repeated again and again that there was a process–and on it went .
Finally , one of the senior political types made it very clear that we personally would be very happy if we just hired X . No , he did not open a briefcase of cash , but his meaning was clear .
Bob and I repeated the mantra , have X send in the resume .
The meeting finally ended .
As soon as Bob and I were outside , we looked at each other and Bob said , “ that was a bribe offer , no ? ” I agreed .
A very strange affair all around .
By the way X went elsewhere and did just fine .
How to Not to Abuse O - Notatation
Bob has a simple idea that I find quite compelling –I will present it in his own words .
Think of this as a guest post .
His initial “ this ” refers to an algorithm that we were discussing via email .
This example brings to mind the idea of rampant misuse of O - notation and an easy way to fix it that I ’ve been teaching and using lately .
Suppose that you think that the running time of algorithm is and another is .
With O - notation , you have nothing to test with an experiment .
But in almost all cases where you are going to run an experiment , it is reasonable to use notation to express a hypothesis .
In this case , you would hypothesize that the running time of the first is and the second is for some constants and .
So the ratio of the running times should be .
Then if you run the same experiment for and take the ratio , all the constants cancel and this ratio of ratios approaches .
Under the hypothesis , running the experiment for larger should give a better approximation to .
Or , you can just run an experiment and solve for the constants to predict running time .
In short , experimental verification of hypotheses is easy with notation and impossible with O - notation .
Despite that fact , O - notation is widely misused to predict and compare algorithm performance .
Bob then added , in his next email :
But actually log factors are not so important with this approach .
For an unknown algorithm , we hypothesize , find by computing for as large an ( and as many experiments ) as we can afford , then use the actual running time to solve for .
This gives very accurate predictions .
Essentially the log factor is absorbed into the constant , which
is not so bad for large .
Open Problems
Try Bob ’s idea out .
Does this simple idea work on interesting problems ?

A high - profile group of children 's authors , publishers , teachers and librarians is calling on the government to make school libraries statutory .
Signatories to a petition to Number 10 include Philip Pullman , Horrid Henry creator Francesca Simon and former children 's laureate Michael Rosen , as well as the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers Christine Blower , Dave Prentis , general secretary of Unison , top children 's publishers and the directors of a raft of youth library associations .
The campaign 's supporters , who also include the Carnegie medal winners Mal Peet and Beverley Naidoo , are concerned that while prisoners have the statutory right to a library , schoolchildren do not , and they believe it is essential that children get the habit of reading for pleasure .
" [ We ] wholeheartedly support the right of prisoners to a library .
It can be part of the process of rehabilitation through education .
We are concerned however that school students do not have the same right .
Research indicates that many young people who offend have low literacy levels , " they say in a letter that will be sent to secretary of state for children , schools and families Ed Balls this evening by the campaign 's head , the twice Carnegie - shortlisted author Alan Gibbons .
Only half of all secondary schools have a full - time librarian , they say , and only 28 % have a qualified librarian .
" Sadly , some of our schools still lack adequate library provision , " they write .
" It would not be expensive to rectify this situation , even in these difficult times .
The social costs of poor literacy are significant . "
Gibbons said this morning that the petition was only the start of a concerted campaign to make school libraries statutory .
" When it 's just the book world , particularly if it 's just libraries , the government feels less pressure than if it is a broad cultural movement supporting literacy , " he said .
" That 's why I 've been working on publishers , teaching professionals and public service unions . "
Last November Pullman told a comprehensive school in Chesterfield that it would become " a byword for philistinism and ignorance " if it went ahead with plans to close its school library .
Since then , Gibbons said , there have been " worrying indications " that more school libraries are likely to close .
" It 's nibbling at the edges at the moment but the signs are there that they are being cut down , " he said .
" We want to at least get the discussion going about how to deal with it . "
The petition itself – which calls on the government " to accept in principle that it will make school libraries , run by properly qualified staff , statutory " – will run until December , but by the end of the summer school term Gibbons hopes to have consolidated the support of the book world and to have started soliciting support from community figures , faith groups and celebrities within the wider community .
Harry Potter creator JK Rowling , he added , was top of his list .
" We do n't want to stand on the sidelines – we want to engage with government , " he said .
NECA 's Comic - Con 2009 display was chock full of BioShock playthings , from sisters big and little to full - sized ADAM extractors .
As we saw last week , NECA is taking great care to make sure their line of BioShock toys is of the highest quality , staying as faithful as possible to the game designs .

I find it nice that they are creating props as well , with the full - sized ADAM extractor finally bringing kids something to help them learn about he joys of ... I really cannot think of anything joyful here , though if you look closely you 'll spot mine and McWhertor 's shoes , which I suppose is kind of fun .

Two influential websites —
The Hill.com ’s Congress blog and the Huffington Post — have provided me with a platform to report on the contrasting impact of alcohol and cannabis on cancer .
If Pot Prevented Cancer You Would Have Read About It , Right ?
via TheHill.com
Two just published studies assessing adults ’ risk of cancer have reported wildly divergent , and fairly extraordinary , outcomes .
One study you may have read about .
The other has been ignored entirely by the mainstream media .
… First , the study you may have heard of .
Writing August 3 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , investigators at McGill University in Montreal reported that moderate alcohol consumption –defined as six drinks or less per week–by adults is positively associated with an elevated risk of various cancers including stomach cancer , rectal cancer , and bladder cancer .
And now for the study you have n’t heard of .
Writing in the August issue of the journal Cancer Prevention Research , investigators from Rhode Island ’s Brown University along with researchers at Boston University , Louisiana State University , and the University of Minnesota reported that that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a “ significantly reduced risk ” of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
As I ’ve written previously , both on this blog and elsewhere , for 35 years the federal government has been well aware –- yet publicly denied –- that cannabis possesses potent anti-cancer and anti-tumor properties .
Even under the Obama administration , which promised to “ base [ their ] public policies on the soundest of science , ” the myth that pot promotes cancer persists .
In fact , the White House ’s website , whitehousedrugpolicy.gov , presently warns , “ Marijuana has the potential to promote cancer of the lungs and other parts of the respiratory tract . ”
Of course , this myth persists in large part because the mainstream media rarely if ever pays attention to studies that could be seen as in any way undermining criminal prohibition .
( In some cases , the MSM even goes so far as to erroneously report about those that do . )
So it ’s hardly surprising that in the three week span since the Brown University study was published , not one mainstream media outlet has reported its findings .
( Full disclosure : over the past days I have personally communicated with several prominent newspapers ’ writers about this study — in each case providing them with the full text of the investigators ’ findings — but have yet to received any positive feedback beyond the obligatory “ We ’ll look into it . ” )
Will the promotion of these findings in prominent alt - media outlets like The Hill and Huff Po reverse the MSM ’s complacency ?
Perhaps — and your feedback to both sites can only help .
So chime in ( ** Note : comments on both sites are moderated ) , and tell the MSM that it ’s time for us to stop having to do their job !

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Ask most Americans how much it costs to visit a doctor and they probably do not know .
Ask doctors what their fees are and they 're not likely to know that either .
Health care prices - both physician fees and prices of medical procedures - have been cloaked in mystery for decades .
But as the number of people who are uninsured , underinsured or are opting for higher - deductible insurance plans grows , consumers have reason to care .
" With health care costs coming directly out of their pockets , these people have more skin in the game , " said Barry Silbaugh , CEO of the American College of Physician Executives ( ACPE ) , an educational association that teaches medical management to physicians .
Most Americans have n't worried about the price of a doctor 's visit because they have health insurance through their employers .
But things have changed .
Besides the 72 million uninsured and underinsured Americans , even those with coverage have had to pay higher premiums and deductibles .
Consumers also have been encouraged into consumer - driven health care plans , tax - free savings vehicles such as health savings accounts ( HSAs ) or health reimbursement arrangements ( HRAs ) , in which up to $ 2,000 comes out of their pocket .
As a result , they can't be indifferent to the cost of a trip to the doctor .
Obstacles
However , several barriers stand in the way of what 's known in the industry as price transparency .
For one thing , there is no such thing as a standardized price list for doctors ' fees or medical procedures .
" There are so many types of payment systems , both public and private , that it 's hard to understand , " said Silbaugh .
" No one pays the same price on anything . "
Another challenge is that insurance companies do n't want their rivals to know what rates they 've negotiated with hospitals and physicians .
That stymies , for example , a doctor trying to answer a patient 's question about how much a recommended hospital procedure might cost .
" As a physician , I struggle to find out what these rates are , " Silbaugh said .
Health care costs also vary significantly across geographical regions , as documented by the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice .
Looking specifically at the disparity in Medicare spending , the institute 's study of 306 health care markets nationwide shows the cost of providing health care to seniors is rising more than twice as fast in Dallas as in San Diego , and that Medicare now spends nearly three times more to care for its enrollees in Miami as it does in Honolulu .
" Even after doing all the research that they can , the health care [ pricing ] system is too darned complicated for the average person to understand , " said Jonathan Weiner , professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Price transparency
Although President Obama has talked about the issue , Weiner said " price transparency does not appear to be a centerpiece " of his health care reform as yet .
But Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Nicholas Papas disagreed , saying that " President Obama is committed to cutting health care costs and price transparency will be an important part of our efforts to reform health care . "
Until Obama unveils specifics about his plans for price transparency , Weiner said consumers have resources that might help remove some of the mystery surrounding health care prices .
Web sites such as Wipricepoint.org and outofpocket.com that research this information are a good place to start , he said .
For those on Medicare , " Medicare Compare is the government 's effort to provide price comparability , " Weiner said .
" But it 's not easy to use . "
Silbaugh said retail clinics in Walgreens ( WAG , Fortune 500 ) and Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) stores also typically list prices for basic primary care .
While cost is important , Weiner and others said consumers should not base their health care decisions solely on prices .
" One of the dangers of greater price transparency is that consumers use prices as a proxy for quality , " said Paul Ginsburg , president of non-profit Center for Studying Health System Change .
" There 's also very limited information available to consumers on provider quality , " he said .
His tip to consumers : " Higher prices do n't always mean better quality of service .
Research your doctor . "
In my Times column last week , I wrote about those inane , utterly pointless , time - wasting “ how - to - leave - a- message ” instructions foisted upon us by Verizon , Sprint , AT&T and T - Mobile .
I calculated that they earn the carriers over $ 850 million a year , just by eating up our airtime .
Several of you asked how I arrived at that calculation .
Here it is : I ’m using , as an example , Verizon ’s $ 60 - a - month plan .
You get 900 minutes for that , which comes out to 6.67 cents a minute .
Verizon has 70 million customers .
If each one leaves a message or checks voicemail twice a day , that ’s 70 million * 6.67 cents * .5 ( half a minute listening to two 15 - second instruction recordings ) * 365 days = $ 852,092,500 .
And that ’s just Verizon !
( Even if you omit free weekend calls , Verizon still makes $ 609 million — and makes you wait 3 hours a year , listening to that same message over and over and over again . )
So how do we fight back ?
It turns out that each carrier offers a “ bypass the instructions ” keystroke that takes you directly to the beep .
( It bypasses both the person ’s own recorded greeting and the 15 - second carrier nonsense . )
To be as evil as possible , the carriers do not promote or tell you about the existence of this keystroke .
Furthermore , the key to press is different with each company :
* for Verizon
1 for Sprint
# for AT&T
# for T - Mobile
Every time you dial a number , you ’d have to know which carrier that person uses .
Which is , of course , impossible .
And you ca n’t just press *- 1-# in a row , hoping to cover all bases — because if you press the wrong keystroke for the wrong carrier , you wind up boxed into that system ’s voicemail menus .
If you ’re clever , though , you can do the “ one - star - pound ” method recommend by this blogger :
STEP ONE .
Press 1 .
If it ’s Sprint , you get the beep , and you ’re done .
If you hear an error recording , go on :
STEP TWO .
Press *.
If it ’s Verizon , you get the beep .
If not :
STEP THREE : Push # .
You get the beep for T - Mobile or Cingular .
You have to pause after each one , and you have to keep listening .
But it ’s one small way to fight back .
Remember : One Star Pound .
Tomorrow in my e-mail column , I ’ll offer a more sweeping suggestion .

A woman walks into a rape , uh , bar .
She rapes the rapist , “ Hey , rape kind of rape do you think I should rape ? ”
The rapist rapes , “ Do n’t ask rape !
I ’m just a rapist ! ”
Ha ha ha ha ha !
Welcome to a post about rape jokes .
Let me tell you a thing you might not know : the inability to hear rape “ jokes ” without flashbacks , Hulk rage , and “ air quotes ” is one of the enduring parting gifts of a rapist .
Here is how this goes :
It is a lovely summer day .
You have some beers , and you and some friends are sitting on a front porch in the breeze and the sun , shooting the shit .
You start talking about politics , and then the Army .
You mention that you have considered joining the Army in the past , but wo n’t , because you ca n’t pledge loyalty to an organization that discriminates against gays ( a round of agreement ensues , so hugely moral are we ) , and as a woman , you ca n’t reasonably aspire to join an organization that is far more likely to brutally rape you ( and brutally cover it up ) than the general population .
One of your friends says , “ But is n’t that actually a benefit of the Army ?
Hur hur hur . ”
Oh , how you wish your friend were an ardent feminist , so you could interpret his comment as a dry observation of the brutal truth , framed humorously to prevent suicide all around .
But no , you know he is making a funnay , the punchline being you and every woman you know .
Several options flash through your head .
Say Nothing .
Hope the conversation does not continue extolling the virtues of rape , making saying nothing harder .
Hate yourself for saying nothing .
Notice girl sitting on the porch of the house next to you who has heard what was said .
Notice her similar reactions .
Hate yourself more for saying nothing , because she has probably been raped , too , because you do n’t know any woman who has n’t .
Hate your friend , because he does n’t know that every woman he knows has been raped .
Have minor flashbacks of what was done to you .
No feeling the sun , the breeze now , just his hand on your shoulder to get leverage .
Simmer with stopped - up rage that this thing he did , his hand on your shoulder , has just been joked about as fun and exciting .
Simmer with stopped - up rage that you said nothing then , too , even though that ’s not really true .
You just said nothing that was listened to , deemed important .
Like your silence and obvious rage is being ignored now .
Stop enjoying the day .
Stop enjoying the company of your friend .
Make a mental note to withdraw from others before they can casually , “ jokingly ” remind you of your rape .
Feel bad .
It ’s not like they know you were raped .
Feel angry .
It ’s not like you ’re ever going to tell them , now .
Feel alone and angry .
Assume bitterly that you will feel this way forever .
Be Edgy !
Jump in with some even MORE offensive humor !
Run with the rape joke !
Make it even more rape-y !
Now your friend will never guess you have been raped .
Bonus prize : if he ever finds out , he will respect you for not making a “ big deal ” out of your rape , for not making it the centerpiece of your life and his on a hot and lazy summer day .
Settle in with the smug knowledge that you are not like those other broken , damaged , traumatized victims .
Withdraw from “ those ” kinds of victims , who might try and drag you down into their hysteria with them .
Throw them to the goddamn wolves .
Throw your flashbacks to the goddamn wolves .
Toast to rape !
Initiate a Very Serious Conversation , out of nowhere , like .
Tell your friend that joke was not funny .
Tell him rape is never funny .
Keep talking after his face has pinched up in resentment and disgust , because you are RUINING his day and his BEER and his FUNNY .
You know you are actually ruining his sense of himself as a good and decent person , but you cannot communicate that to him , because he is smug and disengaged , and you are shaking and stuttering and trying to explain the experience of women to a man who has grown up among women , known women , loved women , and somehow does n’t know this already , which means he does n’t want to know , does n’t care .
Feel vulnerable .
Feel angry that you feel vulnerable .
Consider stopping mid-sentence , getting up , and walking away .
Promise yourself that after this you will never speak to this friend again .
Immediately break the promise , because you know if you do n’t , he will tell everybody that you stopped being friends because you are Andrea Dworkin all of a sudden .
Initiate A Very Serious Conversation Version II : Follow version one , except also disclose to your friend ( who thinks rape is funny and exciting ) that you have been raped .
Be surprised , all over again , that this does not immediately change his perspective , the way it changed yours .
Realize that to him , rape is conceptual , even when it has really happened , even when it is real .
Wonder if he has raped , without knowing it , because it was just a concept .
Realize you now wonder this about every man .
Are you Andrea Dworkin ?
Do you have any right to ruin this lovely summer day by dumping your rape on everybody ?
Did he ?
After this , will he now tell everybody that you FREAKED OUT just because you were apparently “ RAPED ” and you ca n’t GET OVER IT when it was just a JOKE , SERiously ?
Will everybody know you have been raped ?
Will everybody think you are a humorless rape - bot from now on ?
Feel like shit afterwards .
Be reminded that you cannot trust anybody , now .
Because you were raped .
Because you are Andrea Dworkin .
Because you did n’t prosecute .
The reasons do n’t matter anymore ; the result is the same .
You are Angry About Being Raped , which just compounds the stain of Being Raped .
Add in Unable To Take a Joke , and you are officially Female .
Find Some Other Way .
Ca n’t count on this one ; sometimes an alternative pops into your head , sometimes it does n’t .
Sometimes you manage to say “ Rape is funny ! ” and laugh away in such a sarcastic , biting voice that it communicates everything you wanted to say , and you all move on .
Or you do what I did , which was threaten to break my beer bottle on the railing and stab my friend in the fucking neck with it if he did n’t shut his fucking maw .
Ha ha !
I said .
A joke !
Not really , man .
Ha !
Am I kidding ?
Am I ? Fun-nay .
The simmering rage remains , the distrust , the wondering if you should speak to this person ever again , the flashbacks .
But the day moves forward rather than grinding to a screeching halt .
All us Raped And Very Excitable types ( RAVE ! Awesome ) can spend an entire lifetime trying to explain to the general population that Rape Jokes Are n’t Funny .
And I can think of a thousand reasons RJAF , ranging from the Sober and Serious epidemic of rape that really !
truly !
exists , to the fact that I ’ve never heard a rape joke that actually meets the criteria of “ funny ” or “ joke . ”
Which is the bigger question to me : not why are n’t rape jokes funny , but why are they funny ?
What is the punchline ?
What is the humor ?
What is the part that is supposed to make me laugh ?
And why is that supposed to make me laugh ?
As far as I can tell , the “ joke ” is usually that it was n’t really rape at all , or it was n’t a “ real ” rape , or it was a fun rape , or it was a deserved rape .
Which , seeing as how rape victims get to hear that shit , completely seriously ( and with completely serious consequences ) from their rapist , friends , family , and cops , you might see as how it does n’t come off as a joke so much as it comes off as same shit , different day .
And , as far as I can tell , the “ funny ” of rape jokes seems to depend on 1 ) the same part of the brain stem that thinks farting in public is funny – that is , the part of the brain that operates in befuddled and childlike amazement at the doing of things that ought not be done because they horrify Ms Manners , or whatever externalized visualization of a degraded superego one has , 2 ) the assumption that your audience secretly thinks rape is n’t such a big deal and is yearning for you to tell them so , 3 ) nervous laughter .
A note about nervous laughter .
When I was in seventh grade , our social studies class was doing our day and a half of African - American history .
Which , as most of you know , goes like this : slavery ( it was bad – also , Africans did n’t really exist or have lives before they were slaves ) → Civil War ( Lincoln was totally a sweet guy ) → Reconstruction ( Lincoln was so totally totally sweet ) → Somehow Jim Crow ?
( how ’d that happen ? !! ) → Martin Luther King Had a Fucking Dream ( let ’s all tear up ) → FREEDOM AND ICE CREAM BARS FOR EVERYBODY !
( whooooooo no more racism EVAR )
At some point , our teacher started to talk about lynchings .
I do n’t remember what he said , but suddenly everybody in the class started giggling .
Not “ what a funny joke – lynching ! ” giggling , but nervous giggles .
“ I ca n’t believe it ” giggles .
“ Really , just fifty , forty years ago ? ” giggles .
“ In America ?
Are you sure ? ” giggles .
Years later , in college , I read about the rift that began in SNCC during Freedom Summer , when during a training video on voter suppression , white workers started giggling at the fat Southern white dude on the screen .
To them , he was a stereotypical representation of a laughable and ridiculous Southern character .
To the black workers , he was a very real and very brutal enemy .
That was the kind of laughter we had .
The only representation we ’d seen of race relations in America were overblown , saccharine , ham - fisted portrayals of Fat Southern Man defeated by Plucky Black Kid and the I Have a Dream speech washing over the credits .
So to think about lynching , I think it was too big , too horrible , when all we had seen of it was bad drama , and we all started giggling .
Though not all .
One girl , a girl who up until that moment I do n’t think any of us realized was the ONLY black girl in the class , one girl stood up and fucking SNAPPED : “ WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ALL LAUGHING AT ? ” she shouted .
“ MY GRANDADDY WAS LYNCHED . ”
The teacher sent her out of the room , ostensibly because she said “ fuck , ” and then , all shamed - faced , told the rest of us ( white kids he felt comfortable talking to now that the black girl was gone ) that he understood we were n’t giggling because we thought lynching was funny , but we had to remember that this was real stuff : we were talking about real lives that had been destroyed .
Plenty of kids in class were still indignant , all “ that did n’t mean she had to scream at us ! ” but the teacher just held his line : you ’ve got to remember that you ’re talking about real people who died .
The part I wish he ’d mentioned : that we also have to remember we ’re talking about real people who killed .
That was a bit of a side tangent , but I think it ’s got some similarities .
Like , let ’s try this : WHY THE FUCK DOES ANYBODY NEED TO BE TOLD RAPE JOKES AREN ’T FUNNY is kind of like WHY THE FUCK DOES ANYBODY NEED TO BE TOLD GIGGLING ABOUT LYNCHING IS JUVENILE AND CRUEL .
Or , here ’s another : laughing at / telling rape jokes is a pretty clear indicator of how little you can personally identify with the very real consequences of a very real act , just like laughing at / telling lynching jokes is a pretty clear indicator that you ’re so so so white , and have never known and will never know somebody who was lynched ( though you might know somebody who did the lynching ) .
But , let ’s boil this down to its common denominator : laughing at torture that has historically been directed at one class of people who were not allowed access to societal protection or defense is a very clear indicator of where your loyalties lie .
And before it comes up : ignorance is not a defense .
Ignorance of the prevalence of rape , of the possibility that you are making a joke in front of a rape victim , and ignorance of the vastness of racism , is only a further indicator of just how much more fucked up and shitty the experience of the victim you are joking at has been .
And refusing to see that ignorance for what it is , and own it , and make a commitment to educate yourself , is the second very clear indicator of where your loyalties lie .
And do n’t think that ’s lost on the people who have to hear your nervous giggles .
It ’s also , let ’s not forget , a pretty clear indicator of how this whole oppression thing works .
If the torture and abuse of real people were to be taken seriously as a horrible offense , well , we might not do it .
So , something has to be made not serious for the situation to become funny , and you ’ve got two options : the abuse and torture , or the subject of the abuse and torture .
Usually , we choose both !
Rape is fun , and women are n’t real .
So , here ’s the thing : why are rape jokes funny ?
I ’m asking this rhetorically , because I ’ve never heard one that was , though I will leave open the possibility that somewhere out there is a rape joke that is hilarious ( edit : I have personally been amusing myself with RAPE CHOP SANDWICHES lately , but that is my own bag ) .
So let me amend : why are rape jokes supposedly funny ?
Looking at my experience in seventh grade , I think there ’s a lot of similarities .
What we grow up knowing about rape – if we have n’t personally experienced it – fits into a series of tropes , scenes , characters , and stereotypes that are ham - fisted and ridiculous .
We are not meant to take rape seriously ; it is meant to be a joke , a misunderstanding , something that happens to somebody else , out there , who possibly deserves it or even liked it .
The rapist is a shitty frat boy with a scarlet R on his chest , or a crazy man in the bushes .
The rape victim is drunk and stupid and has totally had sex before .
Afterwards she is hysterical and crying and worthless , if she is n’t a man-hating feminazilesbot .
Or , you know , maybe she gets a Lifetime show , which is an eye - rolling adventure in musical swells .
Or , maybe she ’s killed , so we can all focus on her muscular boyfriend who now has a reason to AVENGE .
There is very little in casual , accessible culture that depicts rapists or rape victims as multi-faceted , complex human beings — and they all are .
They are not depicted as people who survive , who go on to read trashy novels and get angry in traffic and learn a new hobby and think about volunteering sometimes but never actually do and get their degree in marketing but actually go into accounting because the job market these days , you know , and if they had never left that one significant other their lives probably would have been different .
And rape is not depicted as an event that has complex meanings and consequences for men or women .
Rather , it ’s depicted as sex to advance the plot , define a ( male ) character , and / or be a super sweet hidden porno in the middle of your movie .
Aside from victim - blaming , rape in movies and books and TV does n’t focus on what women remember from their rapes ( ca n’t say what rapists remember ) , because rape is not meant to be depicted as an experience of women , to resonate with women , and to acquire an audience of women .
These are scenes created by and for men to identify with , and they are created to depict rape as another exciting form of sex that can be had with women .
I do not remember , I do not think about my boobs , or about physical pain , or what my face looked like .
I think about his hand on my shoulder .
I think about what the trees looked like as I stared out the window .
I think about how bright the room was .
But I guarantee you , go find some rape scene to watch , and you will have close - ups of boobs and a woman ’s face contorted in pain and fear .
Because rape , as depicted in culture , is a reflection of our current cultural mindset : women ’s bodies , and women meek and fearful and in pain , are supposed to be sexually titillating to heterosexual men ( whether they actually are is a whole different bag of rocks ) .
So when rape is not depicted as a serious act , something that affects real people , something that women live with for the rest of their lives ( because women are n’t real people ) , of course it ’s not considered a serious topic .
The stereotypical representation of rape is as serious as a fat waddling Southern man with a belt the size of a hula hoop .
So when we trot out rape a a topic , unless the audience has personal experience with rape , we are all thinking of the Lifetime channel , or some hot hot scene from a movie , or angry - faced women on the news marching down the street all frumpy and queer .
Of course it generates nervous giggles , and “ edgy ” humor , and is allowable conversation for not - so - secret misogynists — that ’s what the cultural depiction of rape is meant to do .
Humor that is degrading or offensive to oppressed populations has always operated as a pressure release valve for the things we know we are not “ supposed ” to say or think anymore .
You might not be able to say you really do n’t think 1 in 4 women are actually being raped , and if they are , they probably deserved it , and there are some circumstances where rape is okay – but you can sure as shit make a joke about it !
And if somebody objects , well , here ’s the built - in beauty of an oppressive system : that somebody is probably going to be a member of the oppressed class you are mocking .
And it ’s very easy to dismiss the opinions of oppressed populations .
If we valued the thoughts , feelings , and desires of oppressed populations , we would n’t be able to rationalize and minimize the rape , torture , and murder of them .
I have another story .
When I was a junior in high school , one of my classmates was murdered .
I did n’t know him very well .
We ’d gone to the same school since junior high , he was dating a friend of mine , and it was a very small school , so even though I did n’t know him , I was hit pretty hard with the sudden loss of him .
We found out later that he was murdered in a random drive - by shooting .
The real shitkicker was , my best friend had lost her virginity to the guy who drove the getaway car , and knew the shooters ( she did n’t find that out till they got arrested ) .
They wanted to start robbing folk , and figured it was best if they killed them after .
They did n’t rob my classmate ; he was just target practice .
My classmate was murdered while riding his bike down a peaceful road next to a river .
Found by a jogger .
He bled out pretty quick .
The hospital did n’t know who he was – there was just a shoe with his name scrawled on it .
When he went down , the shooters later testified , he said “ ow . ”
And he lay there , saying , “ Ow , ” not really knowing what had happened , bleeding out on the pavement .
These were the things that ran through my head , day after day .
Could n’t get them out .
And suddenly , I was completely and uncomfortably aware of how I could n’t escape from murder .
I had to stop watching television , stop cracking open books , stop checking the news , stop watching movies , because there I ’d be , trying to relax , trying to forget THEY SHOT HIM HE SAID OW ALL THEY HAD WAS A SHOE , escaping into some movie about who - knows - what , when suddenly the movie fills with blood and gore and there ’s a gun and somebody has to die because the plot has to move along .
And I ’d just get so sick .
I was trying so hard to “ get over it , ” to “ move on , ” to get back to my normal life .
But murder was everywhere .
Violence was everywhere .
I had n’t seen , had n’t realized before just how pervasive it was , and as a joke , as a plot device , as an afterthought , as a vicarious experience .
But now that every drop of blood , every flesh wound , every attack immediately made me think of my classmate , immediately made me imagine him experiencing his death , his pain – I could n’t watch any of that shit anymore .
And I thought of the boys who killed him .
The paper reported that after killing him , “ ow ” became an inside joke .
They ’d drive around going , “ Ow ! ” and laugh and laugh .
That ’s horrible , but I get that .
They had just done a horrifying thing .
They had crossed over into a new world , a world where you can kill people .
They are alive one second , dead the next , at your hand , at your whim .
That ’s a different sort of world to inhabit than the one the rest of us live in , where that shit does n’t happen , or if it does , it ’s out there , somewhere .
There ’s a line in Lolita , after Humbert Humbert shoots Quilty .
He is driving away , and thinks to himself : now that I have transgressed against the laws of man , why should n’t I transgress against the laws of traffic ?
And he begins to drive in the oncoming traffic lane .
I view the joking of those boys the same way .
They had transgressed against the laws of humankind ; why not joke about murder ?
Why not laugh at his pitiful , dying “ ow ” ?
All the rules were unmoored , if they could do this thing .
And I consider joking about rape , about torture , in the exact same vein .
This is why rape victims get to choose how they want to joke about it , if they want to joke about it : only they live in that world without rules , without safety , unmoored from the reality the rest of us know .
Only they get to know what ’s funny about it .
And this is why , for the rest of us , our jokes are crude , cruel , and ignorant : if you do n’t know what the world is like on that other side , your jokes are weak sauce , they are jokes about how that other side does n’t exist , is n’t important , is n’t real , is n’t horror .
And you do n’t know that , because you have the privilege of never going there , if you want .
For those of you who wonder why rape victims get all super sensitive about rape jokes ‘n shit , well , this is why .
Before you ’re raped , rape jokes might be uncomfortable , or they might be funny , or they might be any given thing .
But after you ’re raped , they are a trigger .
They make you remember what was done to you .
And if the joke was about something that was n’t done to you , not in quite that way , you can really easily imagine how it would feel , because you know how something exactly like that felt .
Rape jokes stop being about a thing that happens out there , somewhere , to people who do n’t really exist , and if they do they probably deserved it , and they start being about you .
Rape jokes are about you .
Jokes about women liking it or deserving it are about how much you liked it and deserved it .
And they are also jokes about how , in all likelihood , it ’s going to happen to you again .
And until you ’ve been raped , you do n’t really wake up and see how much rape is out there for the casual consumer .
You did n’t really hear those offhand comments when walking down the street – “ oh , you know she totally made that up for attention ” – you did n’t really notice that the sex scene in Blade Runner actually really looks like a fucking rape scene , you did n’t really hear how the TV news focuses on what she was wearing , and calls it “ sex , ” and digs for details about where and how he penetrated her , when you do n’t really need to know that , do you ?
And you do n’t realize how many of the people you know and love do not take rape seriously , because they have been sucking up all the same TV shows and movies you do , and they do n’t think they know a real person who has been raped .
Of course , some of them you might tell , and they can accept that , accept the secondary trauma , begin to start thinking of you whenever they see a rape in a movie , hear of one on the news , hear a rape joke .
Or they can disqualify you as a real person .
Guess which one happens most .
So , here is my challenge for those who want to tell rape jokes :
Ask every woman in your life if she has been sexually assaulted .
Ask her to tell you her story .
This means your mother , your sister , your girlfriend , your grandma .
Once you have heard all their stories , go watch a movie with a rape scene in it .
One you did n’t mind before .
One you thought people were overly offended by .
Now tell me a joke .
Scientists at the University of the West of England are to design the first ever biological robot using mould .
Researchers have received a Leverhulme Trust grant worth £ 228,000 to develop the amorphous non-silicon biological robot , plasmobot , using plasmodium , the vegetative stage of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum , a commonly occurring mould which lives in forests , gardens and most damp places in the UK .
The Leverhulme Trust funded research project aims to design the first every fully biological ( no silicon components ) amorphous massively - parallel robot .
This project is at the forefront of research into unconventional computing .
Professor Andy Adamatzky , who is leading the project , says their previous research has already proved the ability of the mould to have computational abilities .
Professor Adamatzky explains , “ Most people ’s idea of a computer is a piece of hardware with software designed to carry out specific tasks .
This mould , or plasmodium , is a naturally occurring substance with its own embedded intelligence .
It propagates and searches for sources of nutrients and when it finds such sources it branches out in a series of veins of protoplasm .
The plasmodium is capable of solving complex computational tasks , such as the shortest path between points and other logical calculations .
Through previous experiments we have already demonstrated the ability of this mould to transport objects .
By feeding it oat flakes , it grows tubes which oscillate and make it move in a certain direction carrying objects with it .
We can also use light or chemical stimuli to make it grow in a certain direction .
“ This new plasmodium robot , called plasmobot , will sense objects , span them in the shortest and best way possible , and transport tiny objects along pre-programmed directions .
The robots will have parallel inputs and outputs , a network of sensors and the number crunching power of super computers .
The plasmobot will be controlled by spatial gradients of light , electro - magnetic fields and the characteristics of the substrate on which it is placed .
It will be a fully controllable and programmable amorphous intelligent robot with an embedded massively parallel computer . ”
This research will lay the groundwork for further investigations into the ways in which this mould can be harnessed for its powerful computational abilities .
Professor Adamatzky says that there are long term potential benefits from harnessing this power , “ We are at the very early stages of our understanding of how the potential of the plasmodium can be applied , but in years to come we may be able to use the ability of the mould for example to deliver a small quantity of a chemical substance to a target , using light to help to propel it , or the movement could be used to help assemble micro-components of machines .
In the very distant future we may be able to harness the power of plasmodia within the human body , for example to enable drugs to be delivered to certain parts of the human body .
It might also be possible for thousands of tiny computers made of plasmodia to live on our skin and carry out routine tasks freeing up our brain for other things .
Many scientists see this as a potential development of amorphous computing , but it is purely theoretical at the moment . ”
Professor Adamatzky has recently edited and had published by Springer , ‘ Artificial Life Models in Hardware ’ aimed at students and researchers of robotics .
The book focuses on the design and real - world implementation of artificial life robotic devices and covers a range of hopping , climbing , swimming robots , neural networks and slime mould and chemical brains .

Last night Vi and I watched for the first time a documentary , shot by my friend Jim Coyne , on Joan Baez and the movement against a war no one any longer remembers , far away , on another planet .
It was lovely filmwork .
Jim is a genius .
I may have to stop having friends .
I feel inferior to all of them .
It gets depressing .
Of no interest to anyone but me , perhaps , it completely changed my understanding of Baez , whom I had regarded for forty years as just another pretty voice .
No .
Smart , tough , principled in a world that is n’t .
I hereby apologize .
In that war I forget what planet it was on the freaks and professors and mothers and the simply decent finally managed stop the carnage , though only after the Pentagon had killed 60,000 American kids and a million or so Vietnamese , not to mention devastating Laos and bringing Pol Pot to power .
God I ’m proud .
We ’re such a force for democracy .
When the GIs left Asia in ’ 73 , the commie peaceniks thought they had won .
And they had , for ten minutes .
The grip of the military on the country loosened briefly .
Unfortunately the soldiers learned .
Not how to win wars , which they do poorly if at all , but how to keep a war going .
Winning a war is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be .
The promotions and contracts stop .
When you are paid to do something , it is in your interest not to finish doing it .
The Pentagon ’s first lesson learned was to avoid conscription , as the conscripted and their families will take to the streets .
By using an army of volunteer suckers about whom nobody of importance cares , the military severs its wars from most of the country , which loses interest .
The brass are then free to do as they choose .
The second lesson learned was that while defeating the enemy is not necessary , and perhaps not desirable , controlling the press is everything .
And they did it .
So forty or so years after all the love-ins , the marches , the righteous dope ( all of which may seem silly , but in my view preferable to watching a Cambodian mother screaming over the opened bleeding guts of her child ) the Pentagon is at it again .
Once more the jets howl over remote primitive countries , countries that did nothing to the US and could n’t have , and promotions flow , and contracts , and generals demand more troops and more money to stop communism .
Excuse me , terrorism .
Soon , the Chinese , a better threat , coming to a theater near you .
With the passing of years , one demon fades into another .
Switching enemies is much easier now , what with search - and - replace .

But it ’s all about democracy and freedom and patriotism and Saving America from from something .
The hoopla changes little , and how well it works .
Patriotic friends sometimes say to me of the military ardent things like ,  When your country says go , you go ! 
I seldom point out that no one in their families is in the slightest danger of having to go , nor that  the country  is recruiting hard and they are n’t urging their children to enlist ; nor do I ask ,  What is your attitude toward having your daughter drafted onto the streets of Baghdad for five tours , perhaps coming back drooling and gurbling for life after having her brains scrambled by a roadside bomb ?
Patriotism is important to patriots .
They are full of it , and I ’m about a quart low .
I shut up .
I do n’t want to lose friends .
Yet I think I must be a communist .
It seems to me that when your country says go ,  you should ask ,  Why ? 
Do you have a reason to kill whoever you are being sent to kill ?
Then go .
Otherwise , do n’t .
If I told you to go to Ottawa and kill Canadians , you would think me mad , and think it correctly .
Why then should you obediently kill them because a politician in Washington tells you to do it ?
I do not understand .
And of course your country  does n’t tell you anything at all .
Countries are abstractions .
Men tell you to go , and for their own purposes : Dick Cheney or George Bush , Nixon or Nitze , or the men who run the petroleum industry , or people in the Israeli lobby , or men in the military companies who want contracts , or officers who want to give war a try .
Why are these people my country  ?
And why is n’t Joan Baez my country instead of David Petraeus ?
I will choose who is my country , thank you .
Ledbelly , Benny Goodman , Carl Perkins and Miss Emily Anne will come before Lemay , McNamara , Lyndon Johnson , and Obama .
Long before .
Soldiers talk much of honor .
I do not understand how military service can possibly be thought honorable .
If the Wehrmacht were landing in North Carolina , yes , but I do not believe that it is .
Where is the honor in bombing from the air lightly armed peasants who ca n’t fight back ?
It is cowardly , yes , and obscene , but do not talk of honor .
Murder for hire is murder for hire .
We now have men who sit at screens , drinking coffee and firing missiles from remote robotic aircraft at people on the ground whom they cannot identify .
Brave men , they .
I could burst into a kindergarten and kill the children with a ball bat .
The one is as honorable as the other .

Recently I saw on television a black sergeant in Afghanistan , probably chosen by his commander for photogenicity , standing in front of a tank or mobile gun , I forget which .
He said something scripted like  This is a such - and - such unit , the most powerful fighting force in the world . 
This sort of ritual cockiness is carefully ingrained .
Near my barracks in Parris Island was a sign ,  The most dangerous thing in the world is a Marine rifleman . 
If it had said an ambitious colonel it would have come closer to truth .
But one may wonder ( unless one already knows ) how good the Pentagon ’s military really is .
A pissed - off peasant with an RPG would seem on the evidence more effective than the pricey zoom - kapows arrayed against him .
I cannot endorse the politics of the Taliban .
If one of them told me that my daughter could n’t go to school , one of us would leave the room on a stretcher .
Yet as fighting men , are they not magnificent ?
They have only rifles , explosives , RPGs , and balls .
Their enemies have unlimited air support , helicopters , armor , artillery , sophisticated communications , night - vision gear , good food and excellent medical care .
The Taliban take heavy casualties , their enemies almost none .
The ragheads do not even have PX privileges .
Yet they have not been defeated .
A fight on even terms would last perhaps five minutes .
This , for a trillion dollars .
What the hell .
Plus ca change , plus ca does n’t .
Next year in Beijing .
Tell you what , though .
I never liked Kum Ba Yah , and  We Shall Overcome is probably the sappiest song ever written .
But those people had nothing to be ashamed of .

The Best of Fred Reed
The latest iTunes update , version 8.2.1 , may offer up a few bug fixes , but its real purpose is to prevent the Palm Pre from syncing with iTunes .
The move is n't a surprise .
Last month , Apple warned that future versions of iTunes probably would n't support syncing with non-Apple media players .
Today , Tom Neumayr , an Apple spokesperson , reinforced that position :
" iTunes 8.2.1 is a free software update that provides a number of important bug fixes .
It also disables devices falsely pretending to be iPods , including the Palm Pre .
As we 've said before , newer versions of iTunes may no longer provide syncing functionality with unsupported digital media players . "
Palm had figured out a way to sync the Pre with earlier versions of iTunes , the one caveat being that the Pre could n't handle copy - protected songs .
Despite this shortcoming , iTunes integration was a big plus for Pre fans , particularly those migrating from an iPhone or iPod .
For a while Apple did n't seem to mind , only hinting that the functionality could go away saying :
" Apple is aware that some third - parties claim that their digital media players are able to sync with Apple software .
However , Apple does not provide support for , or test for compatibility with , non-Apple digital media players and , because software changes over time , newer versions of Apple 's iTunes software may no longer provide syncing functionality with non-Apple digital media players . "
Now the music is over .
Here is the Work - Around
So what 's a Palm Pre user to do ?
The easiest option is to avoid upgrading to iTunes version 8.2.1 , since the sync feature should still work with older versions of iTunes .
Another option is to trying a third - party app like Salling Media Sync , a utility that synchronizes iTunes playlists , music , and podcasts with your mobile device , and it 's free for basic use .
Apple 's decision to play hardball with third - party media players may provide ammunition to critics who consider the iTunes / iPod ecosystem a monopoly that needs to be broken up .
If a worthy iTunes competitor does n't appear in the near future , we can expect to hear more grumblings about Apple 's dominance of the online music marketplace .

If safety is an important factor in moving to or visiting Europe , make sure to check out your city ’s crime rate and law enforcement statistics .
Stable governments also call for safe lifestyles .
Many safe cities in Europe are financial and international centers with high standards of living .
Luxembourg City
This tiny country has only 500,000 inhabitants , yet has a highly developed economy and the highest Gross Domestic Product per capita in the world !
It has its own language , Luxembourgish , which is a combination of German and French ( also these are recognized as official languages as well ) .
Terrorist incidents are rare in this area , and police oversight is routinely provided .
The most common crime is non-violent theft , such as snatching purses or breaking and entering .
Bern , Switzerland
Bern is the capital of Switzerland , and has a population of 130,000 .
The official language is German .
There is a very high quality of living , and the cost of living is high as well .
Like most of Switzerland , Bern has a low rate of crime , though white collar crime does occur !
Geneva , Switzerland
Geneva is part of the French - speaking area in Switzerland , which also has a low crime rate .
This city has a population of 182,000 , but over 812,000 people reside in the greater metropolitan area , and it is the most expensive Swiss city .
It is famous for diplomacy and international meetings , and is one of the world ’s most important financial centers .
Violent crime is very rare , and often unheard of in Geneva .
Helsinki , Finland
Helsinki is the capital and largest city in Finland with a population of 578,000 , 10 % of which are foreigners .
It is the major center in the country for education , research , culture , business and government .
Its main airport , Helsinki -Vantaa Airport , offers direct flights to various international locations .
There are some reports of crimes like vandalism and theft , and most violent crimes are domestic and / or alcohol - related ( and occur around holidays ) .
The major language is Finnish , which is very unique and stems from different routes than any other European language .
Zurich , Switzerland
Zurich is the largest Swiss city , with a population of 1.7 million people in the greater metropolitan area .
It is often rated with the best quality of life and richest European city , making it very expensive .
German is the official language , but most local people speak Swiss German , a slightly different dialect from the language in Germany .
It is a global city , and contains the headquarters for many major financial institutions .
Though it is considered the most dangerous city in Switzerland , it is much safer than most Western cities .

Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic will miss the start of the new season due to a calf injury .
Neville , Brown and Van der Sar also injury worries
Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic will miss the start of the new Premier League season due to a calf injury .
Vidic has been struggling with the problem during pre-season and is expected to be sidelined for up to another fortnight .
The Serbia international will now sit out Sunday 's Community Shield clash with Chelsea at Wembley and the following week 's season opener at home to promoted Birmingham City .
Fellow defenders
Wes Brown and Gary Neville are also sidelined , while United boss Sir Alex Ferguson admits it will be at least eight weeks before veteran keeper Edwin van der Sar recovers from a broken finger .
" Everyone is fit apart from Wes , Vidic and Neville , " said Ferguson .
" Gary has done a bit of training , and he is coming along fine .
And I expect Wes to be fit for the Birmingham match .
" Vidic is another week or two away and Edwin 's injury is a bad one .
He 's out for 8 - 10 weeks , of course .
So my first selection dilemma for Sunday is in goal . "
Ferguson also confirmed that he will be treating the game with Chelsea , live on , seriously and will not be using the fixture as an opportunity to work on his players ' fitness .
He added : " In the past I 've treated the Community Shield as a barometer for fitness and giving players some minutes on the clock .
But this year I 'm not looking at it like that .
" All the players are at a good level fitness - wise and everyone should be able to give a good account of themselves .
And when you play Chelsea , pride comes into it and the players want to win . "

Throughout the heroic struggle in Congress to provide a “ public option ” in health insurance , one question never seems to get answered :
Why are we so intent on protecting the private option ?
The “ public option , ” as followers of the debate know , is a government - sponsored health plan that would be available as an alternative to , and in competition with , the for - profit health insurance industry , otherwise known as the private option .
On Friday , the House Committee on Energy and Commerce narrowly passed a reform bill incorporating a public option resembling Medicare .
It was a bloody fight among members of Congress , some of whom believe that the public option will give the government unwarranted power over healthcare , and all of whom enjoy government - provided healthcare that ’s a lot better than what most of us get .
But the battle is just beginning .
After the committee vote , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that the health insurance industry will conduct a “ shock and awe ” campaign to kill the public option when Congress returns from vacation in September and starts debating the measure .
We can expect to be overwhelmed with an industry ad campaign worth millions of dollars ( remember Harry and Louise ? ) exhorting us to write our lawmakers to preserve the American way of healthcare .
Advertisement
So it ’s proper to remind ourselves what that American way entails .
For if the insurers have proved anything over the last 15 years as the health crisis has gathered speed like an avalanche roaring downhill , it ’s that they ’re part of the problem , not the solution .
The firms take billions of dollars out of the U.S. healthcare wallet as profits , while imposing enormous administrative costs on doctors , hospitals , employers and patients .
They ’ve introduced complexity into the system at every level .
Your doctor has to fight them to get approval for the treatment he or she thinks is best for you .
Your hospital has to fight them for approval for every day you ’re laid up .
Then they have to fight them to get their bills paid , and you do too .
One Wendell Potter reminded a Senate committee in June that health insurance executives had assured Congress in 1993 that they would work to secure universal medical coverage and end denials of coverage to people with pre-existing conditions .
Then they moved heaven and earth to kill reform .
They ’ve made the same promises now , Potter observed .
But they ’re in an even better position to throttle reform .
Mergers and acquisitions have turned the industry into a cartel of huge corporations .
Advertisement
“ The industry is bigger , richer and stronger , and it has a much tighter grip on our healthcare system , ” he said .
The last thing they want is a government program set up as their competition .
Potter knows the insurers ’ ways because he was a top executive in the industry for 20 years .
But the hard numbers bear him out .
The two largest insurers , WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group , each acquired 11 other insurers between 2000 and 2007 .
They now control a total of 67 million “ covered lives ” ( that ’s customers in health insurance - speak ) .
This consolidation has produced functional monopolies in communities across America .
The American Medical Assn. ( itself no great fan of reform ) found in a 2007 survey that in 76 % of the country , defined as its major metropolitan statistical areas , one insurer had a share of 50 % or more of the conventional insurance market .
This phenomenon gives the companies enormous power to drive up premiums and maximize profits .
Why do we tolerate this ?
The industry loves to promote surveys indicating that most Americans are “ satisfied ” with their current health insurance -- 37 % are “ very satisfied ” and 17 % “ extremely satisfied , ” according to one such study .
Advertisement
Yet these figures are misleading .
Most people are satisfied with their current insurance because most people never have a complex encounter with the health insurance bureaucracy .
Medical care generally follows the so - called 80 - 20 statistical pattern -- 20 % of patients consume 80 % of care .
If your typical encounter is an annual checkup or treatment of the kids ’ sniffles , or even a serious but routine condition such as a heart attack , your experience is probably satisfactory .
But it ’s on the margins where the challenges exist .
Anyone whose condition is even slightly out of the ordinary knows the sinking feeling of entering health insurance hell -- pre-authorizations , denials , appeals , and days , weeks , even months wasted waiting for resolution .
And that ’s among people with affordable employer - paid insurance , an ever - shrinking cohort .
The percentage of small and medium - sized businesses offering health coverage to employees shriveled to 38 % from 67 % between 1995 and 2008 , according to the National Small Business Assn .
Without reform , the number will continue to plummet .
Meanwhile , people employed by big companies that offer a health plan are within a layoff notice of losing coverage for themselves or their families , joining America ’s 46 million uninsured .

Their only alternative right now is the individual market , where insurers scrutinize applicants ’ medical histories , looking for reasons to turn them down or charge them exorbitant premiums .
Have hay fever , asthma , a cholesterol pill prescription ?
Are you a woman of child - bearing age ?
You ’re virtually uninsurable at an affordable cost .
Even if you ’re accepted , your carrier reserves the right to cancel your policy retroactively if it finds that you left even a tiny condition from years back off your application .
The public option may be your lifeline -- if it ’s enacted .
Signs of the industry ’s mobilization against the public option are everywhere .
I do n’t claim clairvoyance for having predicted this development back in March ; given the industry ’s record on reform , a child could have done so .

You ’ve heard of the Blue Dog Democrats , those mostly rural conservatives who blocked a summertime vote on reform legislation on Capitol Hill ?
According to the Center for Public Integrity , the biggest backer of the Blue Dogs ’ political action committee is the healthcare industry , which is on the path to pumping a total of $ 1.2 million into the PAC ’s maw in the current 2009 - 10 election cycle .
Then there ’s the advocacy group called the Campaign for an American Solution , which describes itself as “ a grass - roots effort . . . to build support for workable healthcare reform . ”
The organization owns up to being an “ initiative ” of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , or AHIP , the industry ’s chief lobbying arm .
Unless I ’ve missed a radical change in lawn and garden horticulture , you ca n’t get much further from the grass roots than to be a creation of the industry with the biggest stake in the debate .
Despite all this , America ’s health insurance plans , which helped create our dysfunctional world , are deferred to as though they ’re a disinterested party .
AHIP subtitled one of its policy papers “ A Vision for Reform . ”
But are the insurers now , and have they ever been , anything other than a roadblock ?

Mysterious , glowing clouds previously seen almost exclusively in Earth ’s polar regions have appeared in the skies over the United States and Europe over the past several days .
Photographers and other sky watchers in Omaha , Paris , Seattle , and other locations have run outside to capture images of what scientists call noctilucent ( “ night shining ” ) clouds .
Formed by ice literally at the boundary where the earth ’s atmosphere meets space 50 miles up , they shine because they are so high that they remain lit by the sun even after our star is below the horizon .
The clouds might be beautiful , but they could portend global changes caused by global warming .
Noctilucent clouds are a fundamentally new phenomenon in the temperate mid-latitude sky , and it ’s not clear why they ’ve migrated down from the poles .
Or why , over the last 25 years , more of them are appearing in the polar regions , too , and shining more brightly .
“ That ’s a real concern and question , ” said James Russell , an atmospheric scientist at Hampton University and the principal investigator of an ongoing NASA satellite mission to study the clouds .
“ Why are they getting more numerous ?
Why are they getting brighter ?
Why are they appearing at lower latitudes ? ”
Nobody knows for sure , but most of the answers seem to point to human - caused global atmospheric change .
Noctilucent clouds were first observed in 1885 by an amateur astronomer .
No observations of anything resembling noctilucent clouds before that time has ever been found .
There is no lack of observations of other phenomena in the sky , so atmospheric scientists are fairly sure that the phenomenon is recent , although they are not sure why .
Over the last 125 years , scientists have learned how the clouds form .
At temperatures around minus 230 degrees Fahrenheit , dust blowing up from below or falling into the atmosphere from space provides a resting spot for water vapor to condense and freeze .
Right now , during the northern hemisphere ’s summer , the atmosphere is heating up and expanding .
At the outside edge of the atmosphere , that actually means that it ’s getting colder because it ’s pushed farther out into space .
It ’s not hard to see how a warming Earth could change those dynamics : as the globe heats up , the top of the atmosphere should get colder .
“ The prevailing theory and most plausible explanation is that CO2 buildup , at 50 miles above the surface , would cause the temperature decrease , ” Russell said .
He cautioned , however , that temperature observations remain inconclusive .
The global changes that appear to be reshaping noctilucent cloud distribution could be much more complex , said Vincent Wickwar , an atmospheric scientist at Utah State University whose team was first to report a mid-latitude noctilucent cloud in 2002 .
Temperature does not explain their observations from around 42 degrees latitude .
“ To get the noctilucent clouds you need temperatures that are about 20 degrees Kelvin colder than what we see on average up there , ” Wickwar said .
“ We may have effects from CO2 or methane but it would only be a degree or a fraction of a degree . ”
Instead , Wickwar ’s explanation is that a vertical atmospheric wave discovered in their LIDAR data lowered the temperature in the region above their radar installation near Logan , Utah .
But then you have to ask , he noted , “ Where ’d the wave come from ? ”
They do n’t really have an answer yet .
Other facilities around the world with similar LIDAR capacity have n’t reported similar waves .
And the Rocky Mountains , near Wickwar ’s lab , can cause atmospheric waves , which could be a special feature of his location .
Other hypotheses abound to explain the observed changes in the clouds .
Human - caused increases in atmospheric methane , which oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water vapor , could be providing more water for ice in the stratosphere .
Increases in the amount of cosmic or terrestrial dust in the stratosphere could also increase the number of brightly shining clouds .
Two years into Russell ’s NASA project , more questions exist than firm answers .
They will have at least three and a half more years , though , to gather good data on upper atmospheric dynamics .
The recent observations of noctilucent clouds at all kinds of latitudes provide an extra impetus to understand what is going on up there .
Changes are occurring faster than scientists can understand their causes .
“ I suspect , as many of us feel , that it is global change , but I fear we do n’t understand it , ” Wickwar said .
“ It ’s not as simple as a temperature change . ”

I am honored to bring you the following post from Dominique Raccah , Publisher and CEO of Sourcebooks .
The other day , I wrote an article in response to Sourcebooks ’ decision to delay the ebook release of their upcoming title Bran Hambric .
Behind the scenes , there was much debate on this topic , and Dominique offered her thoughts behind this decision .
I am so pleased that she chose to make them public here .
In this time of change , there is nothing more important than open dialogue between stakeholders : publishers , agents , authors , readers , booksellers , distributors .
It ’s easy to think one side is right , the other is wrong , and while I still believe my own position has merit , I believe even more in listening and understanding how Sourcebooks came to make this decision .
It ’s okay to disagree ; it ’s more important to understand the perspective of others .
After you read , let ’s talk .
Let ’s debate .
Let ’s have a real dialogue .
I know I want to hear from all sides , and I know Dominique is open to all points of view .
What are words worth , I wonder ?
by Dominique Raccah , Publisher and CEO of Sourcebooks
Given responses to the Wall Street Journal article on Monday , I thought it might be useful to explain some of the thinking that went into the decision to delay the ebook release of our very hot upcoming children ’s book , Bran Hambric .
And that includes this background :
We need a sustainable author / publisher model , and it ’s probably not the model of old .
But the new music model of low - priced content and sales of concerts and ancillaries is probably not a viable model for book publishing .
Authors , unlike musicians , do n’t typically have paid live performances ( and t- shirt sales are usually few ) .
They have words .
And we need to have a real conversation about what those words are worth ( and that ’s what the pricing issue is actually about ) and how do we keep them worth enough to support authors , authorship and publishers .
And yes , we can ( and I suspect will ) have a conversation about whether that last piece is worth supporting and at what level .
But here ’s the thinking :
I agree wholeheartedly that digital formats should be readily available , immediately ( you can see from other decisions we ’ve made how important digital is to us ) .
We are being told ( repeatedly ) that ebooks are inherently less valuable — they are not physical ; they are not easily ported ; they can disappear at any time ; etc .
The value issues of ebooks are not issues that can be solved by a single publisher .
Eretailers are suggesting that the “ right ” price point for an ebook is maximally $ 9.99 .
And they are proselytizing the price $ 9.99 .
We ca n’t control what retailers charge for books or ebooks .
The choices book publishers have are :
To make the product available , and when To have a relationship with that retailer
So that ’s the fundamental decision we get to make .
It ’s not , what ’s the right price for this author…or for a book that he ’s worked 10 years on ( yes , Michael Malone ’s new hardcover The Four Corners of the Sky is also not available as an ebook ) … it ’s just do we make it available and when ?
Formats have windows .
We know when we ( book publishers ) put out different formats in the lifecycle of a book .
So we should n’t be releasing ebooks at the same time that we release a hardcover book .
We should be releasing ebooks when we release the trade paper or mass market of the hardcover and can then price appropriately to that .
To me the decision is analogous to a new release in movie theatres ; we do n’t expect that movie to be immediately available on DVD .
There are some who say , digital and print do n’t cannibalize and you ’re going to miss sales .
But is n’t this the same as people ( myself included ) who say I ’ll wait until it comes out in paperback or I ’ll wait to see the DVD ?
And do n’t those people sometimes forget and not buy or rent ?
So yes , there ’s a risk that sales will be missed , but is n’t that a risk that has always existed in format choices ?
If you continue with the lifecycle concept , the vast majority of the books we ( Sourcebooks ) publish will release in e-formats at the same time as p-formats because we are primarily a trade and mass paperback publisher .
And in fact our xml workflow structures towards simultaneous release in multiple ebook / ereader formats .
I would also argue that music is absolutely not the right model to compare books and book publishing to .
And newspapers are even less appropriate .
However , that ’s a really long conversation , and I ’m a publisher not a pundit .
We should make the choices that are right for our authors and their readers .
We are at the beginning of model building .
If hot frontlist titles are to be available in e-formats , they need to be priced by the publisher , at a reasonable discount from the hardcover retail price ( to take into account the devaluation of eformats ) .
I am totally open to that .
But that ’s not an option currently available .
I think people may be willing to pay the premium to have the new new thing , or they may want to wait until the price falls with the trade paper edition , at which point the e-book price should be adjusted and $ 9.99 may make perfect sense .
I agree with Kassia that it ’s dangerous to expect consumers to play by the rules of last year ’s business model .
I ’ve taken action in this one situation and I certainly wonder if there are other options that are neither mine nor the $ 9.99 option .
And I also agree that we need to experiment , and I see our industry beginning to do that .
But this pricing and release - date situation does n’t feel like an experiment .
This actually seems more like a dictate that could have enormous ramifications , perhaps not today , perhaps not tomorrow , but certainly long - term on the future of authors and books .
And I think all I ’m saying is , let ’s think about this .
It ’s too important .
As a publisher , we have to be strategic , book by book ( and it ’s important to remember that we ’re talking about 1 book ; Sourcebooks has 850 ebooks available ) .
These are big decisions for our authors and ourselves .
So in situations where the e-format release could hurt the author ’s launch , what if we were to wait ?
If you live in the South , then you immediately recognize that there is another player involved in this Jesse Helms - William Weld - Richard Lugar struggle over the soul of the Republican Party .
That player is the devil .
He occupies a much different place in Southern life than he does in the rest of the country .
He is a living presence here , not just a concept .
I have no idea how he got here ; for that information you 'll have to consult the works of William Faulkner or Billy Bob Thornton .
But , as Jesse Helms knows , he is here , and as a neighbor he takes a little getting used to .
True , the devil does have his fun side .
Night life in the South is marvelously seedy and there is a very palpable sense of sin .
The biker bars are rougher , the gay bars are gayer ( the South is the home of drag ) , the nudie bars are nudie-er .
And ah , the parking lot of a Southern bar on a muggy Saturday night .
That truly is the devil 's playground .
With any luck you 'll find drugs , prostitution , gambling and firecrackers , not to mention the town 's leading minister and a county commissioner or two .
That is the best thing about sin in the South : the devil still makes you do it .
When Jimmy Swaggart made his famous confession on TV , Northerners saw the ruined shell of a man , his life destroyed by addictive behaviors .
Southerners saw a minor slip that should be all cleaned up by next week .
You 're allowed a slip every now and then .
The South is the only place left where you can get drunk regularly and not be considered an alcoholic .
But some of the devil 's little schemes are not as entertaining as televanangelism .
The South -- and here , as a Southerner by birth and heritage , I 'm defining the South as anywhere they automatically serve grits with your eggs -- certainly is the land of strange crimes .
People are always disappearing and then being found six months later in the woods by a hound dog , all decomposed .
And there is a serious devil - worshiping problem among the young .
Just yesterday a group of teen - agers were put on probation for listening to Marilyn Manson and then going out and turning over tombstones .
HOMEOPATHY is unproven and its products should not be sold , a visiting critic of alternative medicine says .
British physicist Simon Singh , who was sued by the British Chiropractic Association for saying their therapies for children were bogus , said yesterday it was " obvious " that homeopathy " should n't be allowed " and could n't be regulated by a code of ethics .
" I take a fairly hard line , " he said .
" If anyone is making claims that can't be supported by evidence , these claims should be halted and these practices should be prevented . "
He said recent cases showed that homeopathy  which relies on the principle of " like treating like " and diluted ingredients  can be dangerous .
Two weeks ago in the US a homeopathic remedy called Zicam , which claimed to treat the common cold , was withdrawn from sale after it was discovered the zinc it contained may have caused more than 900 people to lose their sense of smell .
Critics said the over - the - counter product 's side effects had gone unnoticed because of less strict rules for marketing alternative medicine .
Digging through some of the old Python archives I found really interesting post by Mike Pall of LuaJit 's fame ( the post can be found here ) .
Pall was talking about possible ways to improve Python 's performance .
One of his findings was that the branching code was one of the major culprits and that affected Python 's runtime performance .
This is mainly due to the fact that it was not optimized for the commonly used paths .
This is understandable , since a compiler like GCC will have no prior knowledge on how the binary will perform .
So branch predicition remains as such , a predicition that might be skewed from the true state of affair .
In his email Mike offered a technique to show that with a little compiler trickery this effect could be a little marginalized .
I followed his steps but this time I did it for the Ruby 1.9.1 p129 binary .
First I ran configure on the source code and in the Makefile I added - fprofile - arcs to optflags .
Then make was run which resulted in a Ruby binary , lots of .o files and lots of .gcda and .gcno files .
What we have now is a binary that will profile the branching behaviour of the application .
Next we need to run the binary in a real life situation such that we it can record how branching will be done in the wild .
I tried a simple benchmark applicaition that included lots of math and string operations .
After doing that the make file was changed once more , this time - fprofile - arcs was replaced with - fbranch - probabilities .
This asks the compiler to use the branching probabilities that were generated from the previous run .
All .o files were deleted and make was run again resulting in a shiny new ruby binary that is ready for testing .
I ran the new binary head to head against the regular one .
I used several ruby scripts for that matter and the result was that the new binary was almost consistently faster than the old one , usually by a little margin but for one benchmark the difference reached 40 % .
Even though the code samples differed widely from the one used in the profiling it was apparent that the VM itself gained a little from this optimization which would cause all Ruby scripts to gain as well .
At the end of the day , an average 5 % improvement is not something to brag about but the fact remains that this shows that the Ruby VM still has a way to go .
Considering that a silly , mostly static attempt did that I think that a JIT engine with tracing optimizations can do wonders for this little language .
Since it will adapt to the application usage patterns and should be able to eliminate lots of the slow code paths in ways that static optimization cannot predict before hand .
Remember the failures
With the unparalleled success of both the iPod and iPhone , Apple has become celebrated for sleek devices that fly off the shelves .
But deep in the annals of Apple history are a number of products that were , put simply , commercial flops .
With all eyes now focusing on the potential release of an Apple tablet , it might be a good time to take a look back at some of Apple 's product disasters .

I do n’t believe in organic .
There , I ’ve said it and I feel better .
It ’s something that ’s been on my mind for years .
Now , do n’t get me wrong : I ’ve got nothing against organic farmers .
In fact , some of my favorite farmers are organic .
I really admire them : Growing delicious food and doing it according to organic standards is adding a degree of difficulty that I would n’t wish on anyone .
But a lot of my favorite farmers are n’t organic , and therein lies the rub .
This may shock some people , and for that I guess I ought to apologize .
But really , if I ’m honest , I think the ones who need to do the apologizing are the often - well - meaning organic advocates who paint such a black - and - white picture of the way farming works that it seems there should be no choice at all .
Listening to them , you get the idea that if you are n’t eating fruits and vegetables that were organically grown , you might as well be mainlining Agent Orange or handing your money straight to some giant industrial agricultural corporation .
You ’re certainly not going to be getting anything with any flavor , they ’d argue .
I ’ve been covering agriculture and farmers markets for more than 20 years , and in that time , I ’ve visited scores , if not hundreds , of farms , both conventional and organic .
I wrote a book on the subject .
And I can say with some degree of certainty that that those ideas are , at best , an oversimplification .
The real world is n’t black and white at all .
Between pure organics and the reckless use of chemicals , there is a huge gray area , and this is where most farming is done .
Ignoring this means that not only are you being misinformed , but you ’re also taking your eye off the real mission of supporting small farmers who grow wonderful food .
Whether something is grown organically might be one of the factors you use when you ’re considering what to buy , but it is by no means the only one :
For me , seasonality , locality and -- above all , flavor -- trump it .
And it certainly is not a surefire solution to all of life ’s ( or even agriculture ’s ) ills .
You can be a bad farmer growing organically , and you can be a good farmer and still use chemical pesticides , herbicides and fertilizers .
In large part , this is a credit to the organic farming movement , as many of the ideas and techniques it pioneered have now worked their way into the mainstream , reducing the use of chemicals even among farmers who are n’t completely organic .
A positive influence
In fact , the sustainable agriculture movement recognizes this , claiming as one of its central tenets the much vaguer requirement of “ environmental responsibility ” and stating plainly that that does n’t necessarily require growing strictly organically .
And as far as the image of organic farming being the domain of small family farms , for the most part , that is no truer than with conventional farms .
A study by UC Santa Cruz professor Julie Guthman , included in her splendid book “ Agrarian Dreams , ” found that the sizes and ownerships of working organic and conventional fruit and vegetable farms are not that different .
That probably should n’t be that much of a surprise .
Contrary to the image of farming being run by a few giant industrial agricultural corporations , roughly 85 % of all farms in California -- organic or conventional -- are owned by individuals or families , and 75 % are smaller than 100 acres .
( On the other hand , Earthbound Farm , which grows organic lettuces and other vegetables , now cultivates more than 40,000 acres . )
The real problem with most farming today is with a commodity marketing system that demands that every decision be made based on what will be cheapest , not what will result in the best flavor .
That -- not a simple choice between organic and conventional -- is what makes even small farms behave like industrial giants and ship fruits and vegetables that may look great but have no taste .
The similarities do n’t end with size and ownership .
While organic farming was once a broad philosophical concept that included such things as composting , fallowing land for a certain amount of time every year and even paying living wages to workers , today the difference between organic and conventional is defined almost entirely by the choice not to use certain chemicals .
Certainly , there is a problem with chemical pesticides , herbicides and fertilizers when they are used incorrectly .
But it ’s quite a leap to suggest that because something is harmful when misused , it must n’t be used at all .
Making choices
The hard - line organic - or - nothing crowd refuses to recognize this .
As a result , as with any other zero - tolerance program , that can lead to making some awfully dumb decisions .
Walking through the Santa Monica farmers market the other day , I again heard it repeatedly : Customers asking farmers “ Are you organic ? ” as if it were some kind of litmus test for quality or safety .
I saw somebody walk away from the absolutely heavenly Snow Queen white nectarines at Art Lange ’s Honey Crisp stand because he does n’t embrace the organic label .
This has happened so many times to Fitz Kelly , another terrific stone fruit grower at the Santa Monica market , that he has even printed up a fact sheet he routinely hands out explaining why he is n’t organic .
Basically , it comes down to an orchard rooted in sandy , nutrient - poor soil that requires help from fertilizers ; a preference for occasional , minimal sprayings of chemical pesticides rather than what he believes would be more frequent use of weaker , organically approved pesticides ; not being willing to spend the time or the money that it takes to go through organic certification ; and , truth be told , probably a good chunk of innate Irish stubbornness .
I ’ve been to both of these farms and walked the orchards .
You see all the right things : the mix of weeds growing between the trees ( in order to attract the good bugs that will eat the bad bugs and reduce the need for spraying ) ; the slight pallor of the leaves ( too dark a green can mean overfertilizing ) ; the healthy , diverse communities of birds and wildlife that make them home .
But most important , I ’ve tasted the fruit that comes from them .
Because if there ’s one thing I ’ve learned in more than 20 years of covering farming , it ’s that you ca n’t fake flavor .
You can fudge on almost everything else , but really delicious fruits and vegetables come only from talented , careful farmers doing their very best work .
And that ’s true regardless of the label that ’s attached .

Rejection Hurts Love - Struck Wheelchair Warrior Falls Head Over Heels , Twice
Love can make people do bizarre things .
A pensioner in western Germany , who went cross-country in his wheelchair to propose , found out first hand that the course of true love never runs smooth .
FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers CHARLOTTE ( AP ) 
A religious broadcaster is building a $ 4 million home in a gated , lakefront community in western South Carolina at the same time that the ministry has cut jobs and reset thermostats to save money in its new headquarters .
Inspiration Networks ' CEO David Cerullo is building the 9,000 - square - foot home on a lot that overlooks Lake Keowee , The Charlotte Observer reported Monday .
Inspiration Networks has drawn scrutiny for up to $ 26 million in incentives it won from South Carolina to move from Charlotte to Indian Land , S.C. , in Lancaster County .
The network 's revenues are expected to approach $ 100 million , largely donations from people who are told God favors those who donate .
Cerullo has said 80 cents of each donated dollar is spent to spread the Gospel .
In addition to laying off workers , the newspaper reported , the ministry froze wages and stopped making contributions to 401 ( k ) retirement accounts .
The thermostat on the network 's new building was cut to 65 degree during the winter .
A network spokesman did not respond to calls and e-mails requesting comment on the house .
Cerullo defended his $ 1.5 million in compensation in a March interview and said he rejected recommendations that he be paid more .
" If they 've got these kinds of assets , does the state really need to offer ... tax breaks ? " asked Don Weaver , president of the S.C. Association of Taxpayers .
Employees told the newspaper the ministry began laying off some workers late last year .
Sen .
Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , is investigating the finances of six other televangelists and told the newspaper that leaders of religious nonprofits should be careful not to use viewers ' donations to adopt extravagant lifestyles .
IRS rules bar nonprofits from paying " unreasonable compensation " to officials .

The militarization of police forces around the world is a growing problem .
While studying at a Chinese university , I never grew comfortable riding elevators with police officers armed with automatic rifles .
Police militarization is not limited to authoritarian countries but may be a sign that a country is moving in that direction .
Many U.S. cities , including Washington , DC , have begun to arm their officers with automatic weapons .
In the UK , police forces have special powers to stop " raves , " defined as :
A gathering on land in the open air of 100 or more persons ( whether or not trespassers ) at which amplified music is played during the night ( with or without intermissions ) and is such as , by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played , is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality .
with riot vans , body armor , and a helicopter
To show their force , the police used ( or abused ) this law in breaking up a " rave " that was posted as an all - night event on Facebook .
Actually , the " rave " was a 30th birthday party barbecue on private property .
The event had 17 confirmed guests on Facebook .
The police arrived at 4 pm ( before the hosts turned on any music ) !
Naturally , the police defend their actions against claims of excessive force .
Designing CD covers is a dream for pretty much every designer , we often feel that we will be more free working for other artists , which is quite true .

Vitamin supplements have been both heralded and hyped over the years , only to ultimately fall from grace once research proves them to be little more than placebos in our quest for longer life or better health .
But at least one substance may have true merit -- vitamin D .
Long considered just a supplement consumed with calcium for bone health , this humble vitamin may have untapped potential in fighting or preventing disease , suggests an explosion of new research .
Not only has it shown promise in reducing the risk of , among other things , diabetes , pancreatic cancer , breast cancer and cardiovascular disease , but it also seems to improve infertility , weight control and memory .
Two advocacy groups have sprung up in the United States to promote the substance .
Food industry executives are exploring ways to fortify more products .
And PubMed , an international database of medical literature , shows that 2,274 studies referencing the vitamin have been published -- just this year .
“ Vitamin D is one hot topic , ” says Connie Weaver , a professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue University in Indiana .

Next week , hope and hype may collide .
An Institute of Medicine committee will convene in Washington to discuss whether the recommended daily intake of vitamin D and calcium should be increased .
There , researchers overwhelmed by the vitamin ’s potential will square off against skeptics who say much more study is needed before people are urged to take vitamin D supplements .
Getting the newly suggested amounts would be difficult otherwise .
The last time guidelines were issued on the vitamin was in 1997 , long before an onslaught of scientific information suggested people are getting too little .
Currently , the recommended daily intake is 200 to 600 international units with an upper limit of 2,000 IU .
Some researchers are advocating at least 600 IU a day , with an upper limit of 10,000 IU .
Giving impetus to this push are the facts that many people seem to be deficient and that the nutrient appears to play a role in many conditions .
Other scientists say it ’s too soon to urge everyone to take supplements .
An influential report released in June by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found little conclusive evidence to support increasing the recommended amounts .

“ I think there is a consensus that we might benefit from higher vitamin D levels , ” says James C. Fleet , a professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue University and a longtime researcher on the vitamin and prostate cancer .
“ But the committee is going to ask whether there is existing scientific evidence that is strong enough to make a change . ”
Vitamin D has long been known to be crucial to bone and muscle health by improving calcium absorption in the intestines and the way calcium is regulated in bones .
More recent research shows that receptors for it are found in almost every organ and tissue system in the body , suggesting that deficiencies may affect many types of cell functions .
When exposed to sunlight , the skin makes the vitamin , but not everyone spends the five minutes a day or so outside that is necessary for synthesis -- and many more people today wear sunscreen to prevent skin cancer .

“ A large portion of people fall into the at - risk category , and they would benefit from being brought out of that category , ” Fleet says .
“ The question is : Is the current requirement enough to keep most people out of the at - risk category ? ”
A study of 13,000 Americans , published in March in the Archives of Internal Medicine , found that 50 % to 75 % have suboptimal levels by current standards .
A level of 20 nanograms per milliliter of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D -- the form most commonly measured in blood -- has traditionally been considered sufficient .
Most people 50 and older are n’t meeting the current recommendations , Weaver says .
The vitamin is found in relatively few dietary sources -- some fortified foods , such as milk and some cereals , and naturally only in some fatty fish , such as salmon .
Three cups of fortified milk provide only 300 IU .

“ The largest source is sunshine , but not everyone can depend on that , ” Weaver says .
“ The elderly , dark - skinned people , higher - latitude dwellers all have trouble getting enough from sun . ”
In darker - skinned people , melatonin in the skin blocks absorption of the ultraviolet rays needed to make the vitamin ; older people do n’t appear to synthesize it from the sun as well as younger people .
Some scientists argue that levels of 40 to 60 ng / mL would be far better for disease prevention .
That would require daily intake much higher than the current 200 to 600 IU .
The July issue of the Annals of Epidemiology ( 09 ) X0007 - 4 , devoted to vitamin D research , links the vitamin to lower risks of cancers of the breast , colon , ovaries and prostate .
Animal and lab studies also demonstrate its importance in many of the cellular mechanisms that control cancer , such as cell growth , cell death , inflammation and DNA repair .
Five studies on colorectal cancer and breast cancer , taken together , showed that people with levels higher than 34 to 52 ng / mL had a 50 % reduced cancer risk , says Cindy D. Davis , a researcher at the National Cancer Institute ’s Nutritional Science Research Group .

Such studies are not proof that the vitamin influences disease development , points out Dr. Karen E. Hansen , an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin who studies bone health .
“ People with higher vitamin D may just be healthier for other reasons , ” she says .
But evidence linking higher blood levels to diabetes and cardiovascular disease is also mounting .
A study in December in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that deficiency may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease .
Other studies have tied lower levels to an increased risk of hypertension , diabetes , stroke and congestive heart failure .
Even for bone health , some studies suggest that about 700 to 800 IU a day are needed to prevent fractures in people over 50 , Hansen says .
She recommends 800 IU a day , with calcium , to her patients .
Meanwhile , studies show that the previous estimation of a toxic dose -- 2,000 IU a day -- is most likely too conservative .
Toxic doses can lead to a dangerous level of calcium in the blood , high blood pressure and even kidney failure .

“ It ’s likely they will increase their recommendation for all ages , ” Hanson said of the Institute of Medicine committee , which will release its report next year .
But not everyone is convinced the advice should be changed .
In a report ordered by the federal government to assist the committee , researchers concluded there is a lack of strong evidence to support altering recommendations .
The committee is not expected to change calcium recommendations .
“ We did not find data that indicate a specific level of vitamin D intake is associated with adverse outcomes or beneficial health outcomes , ” said Dr. Thomas A. Trikalinos , co-director of the Tufts Evidence - based Practice Center , which prepared the report .
He said the report was meant to inform the committee and did not make recommendations .

“ The report sees the totality of the evidence and tries to put everything into perspective , ” Trikalinos says .
Already , however , the American Society of Clinical Oncology has recommended a higher intake for breast cancer patients who are deficient .
In October , the American Academy of Pediatrics said children should get 400 IU a day , double the current recommendation .
In November , 18 University of California researchers issued a statement saying 2,000 IU is appropriate for most people .

“ I think some of the more vocal advocates are pushing the medical community to move forward ” before adequate research is completed , Fleet says .
Dozens of more scientifically rigorous studies are in progress that could help resolve the questions about how much people should consume .
“ I think they held this [ Institute of Medicine ] meeting two to four years too early , ” Fleet says .
“ They are working without the big wave of vitamin D research that was initiated after people started pushing for it . ”

Some health experts say people should consume at least 600 international units of vitamin D a day , with an upper limit of 10,000 IU , far above current standards .
CURRENT RECOMMENDED DAILY INTAKE OF VITAMIN D :
Age 49 and younger : 200 IU
Pregnant and lactating women : 200 IU

Ages 50 to 70 : 400 IU
Age 71 and older : 600 IU
Upper limit : 2,000 IU

Europe 's perhaps foremost pro-inflationist columnist , Ambrose Evans - Pritchard at the Telegraph , is holding up Iceland as an economic role model .
No , I am not kidding , follow the link if you do n't believe me .
His article are full of misleading or false assertions meant to deceive the reader .
Contrary to his assertions of " stabilization " , unemployment has risen far more in Iceland than in the euro area .
While unemployment is now quite similar , it used to be ( for structural reasons unrekated to monetary policy far lower in Iceland ) .
He further claims that Iceland has seen rising exports .
Which is true , but only in terms of Icelandic kronas .
In terms of just about any other currency it has however dropped significantly .
To understand why measuring exports in terms of ISK , remember that Zimbabwe saw dramatic increases in exports in terms of Zimbabwe dollar before that currency vanished ( Just like it saw dramatic increases in wealth generally in terms of Zimbabwe dollars ) ....
He of course also leaves out that with an increase in unemployment from 3.1 % to 9.1 % , even as the participation ( " activity " ) rate declined from 84 % to 81.9 % and the average work week dropped from 40.8 hours to 38.9 hours and the average real wage dropped 8.2 % , we 're talking about a total real income reduction of about 20 % in Iceland .
That is not " magic [ ally positive ] " , even in the context of this crisis .
The near collapse of the ISK has n't exactly brought much good to Iceland , in other words .
And recommending it as a general policy is even more senseless , because as I 've explained before , relative exchange rates are zero sum games , meaning that it is impossible for everyone to devalue against each other .
Yet the damage done to others through devaluation will help conceal the damage that policy does to the devaluing country .
The AVSN brigade marches in Caracas , May 1 , 2008 .
By the Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network
In a world being devastated by economic crisis , global warming , war and famine , the Bolivarian revolution that is unfolding in Venezuela is an inspiration , an affirmation that “ people power ” can rapidly change the conditions of life for the majority of people .
The Venezuelan people ’s remarkable progress over the last 10 years in creating what they call “ socialism of the 21st century ” proves that another world – a peaceful , democratic and socially just world -- is possible .
Whereas in Australia , health , education and public infrastructure is being run down and / or privatised , in Venezuela , major industries are being put back into public ownership and under the workers ’ control , and universal access to health , education and social welfare is guaranteed .
Whereas in Australia , workers are being sacked , wages and conditions are being eroded and active trade unions are under attack , in Venezuela , wages are increasing , and union membership and organisation is growing .
Whereas in Australia , Aboriginal people continue to live in Third World conditions and continue to die in custody , in Venezuela , Indigenous people have Constitutionally guaranteed land rights and representation in parliament , and are exercising self - determination .
The Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network ’s regular brigades to Venezuela offer a unique opportunity to observe first - hand many aspects of the Bolivarian revolution .
The AVSN is currently organising its 10th brigade to Venezuela , to run from December 1st to 9th this year , and is inviting expressions in interest in participating .
Almost 200 people have participated in the AVSN ’s solidarity brigades , and reports , articles and photos about previous brigades from the participants are available at http://www.venezuelasolidarity.org.
The itinerary of the December 1 - 9 , 2009 , brigade will include visits to worker - controlled factories and cooperatives , and to some of the new community - run public education and health programs , and community media outlets .
The participants will also observe participatory democracy at work in the communal councils , and meet with a range of grassroots organisations , politicians and intellectuals about the radical changes being implemented in their country .
Accommodation , transport and English translation within Venezuela will be organised for participants , and the total cost of joining the brigade from Australia will be approximately A$ 4500 .
This includes international airfares and taxes ( from Australia – contact the organisers if you ’d like to join the brigade from somewhere else in the world ) , accommodation for the nine days ( twin - share basis ) , food and transport within Venezuela , and the brigade registration fee ( A$ 500 ) .
The summer holidays provide the government with plenty of good days to bury bad news .
Folks head off on holiday and journos head into the silly season , making it a perfect time to quietly lift the sluice gates of the pools of political sewage .
This year is no exception .
The government announced its proposed changes to the laws controlling protest around parliament , commonly known as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 or Socpa .
There is little public support and considerable antipathy towards this totemic law seen by many as a symbol of Labour 's contempt of liberty , but I am running ahead of myself , so let us recap .
The first clue as to this law 's nature is that it was introduced by David Blunkett with the specific aim of removing the peace protester Brian Haw from his vigil in Parliament Square .
Blunkett went on record as saying it was a " sledgehammer to crack a nut and this is a tough nut "
It is not often that a law introduced to punish one individual serves any great purpose and so it was for Socpa .
The act makes it illegal for a protest in a designated area of up to a 1 km radius of parliament without seeking written authorisation from the police six days in advance .
As there is no strict legal definition of what constitutes a demonstration it means that one person wearing a stop the war badge and standing by Westminster tube station could be arrested for demonstrating without authorisation .
" Ah , " you may cry , " this is merely legalistic supposition . "
Not so , a friend of mine was threatened with arrest for having a picnic in Parliament Square , her offence was the pink icing on her cake which spelt the word " peace " .
This was the same law that saw Maya Evans and Milan Rai arrested and convicted for reading the names of the British and Iraqi war dead by the Cenotaph .
The law enables the police to place conditions on a demonstration in the area , restricting how many people attend the demonstration , where it can be held , how long it can be held for and " the number and size of banners used " .
As if police have not got better things to do than count the banners on a demo to see if there is one too many .
After campaigns that defied and ridiculed the law Jack Straw announced it would be repealed .
News of Jacqui Smith 's intentions to scrap it were leaked to the Observer in 2008 and the draft constitutional renewal bill even announced its demise .
Despite the government dragging its feet , hopes were cautiously optimistic when the joint committee on human rights published their report Demonstrating respect for human rights ?
( pdf ) in March 2009 .
The report recommended the Socpa laws " be repealed , principally because they have proved too heavy - handed in practice , are difficult to police , and lack widespread acceptance by the public . "
And indeed the constitutional reform and governance bill , released this July , does repeal section 132-138 ( the bad bits ) of Socpa !
Hurrah !
So have the government belatedly done the right thing ?
We have long ago given up hope of that happening and once again we would be proven right .
Socpa is to be replaced by a new provision in the Public Order Act .
" What are these powers ? " you may ask and the simple answer is that no one knows , they are to be introduced with a statutory instrument , which is a bit of law written by the relevant minister after the law is passed .
So parliament will approve a law that has yet to be written with no chance of amending it .
What we do know is that whatever laws are passed apply to a radius of 250 metres from parliament , which reduces the area the law covers but will still include Downing St , the back end of the MoD , parts of the embankment by St Thomas ' hospital , bits of the Thames , Westminster Tube station , BERR , Defra , the Foreign Office , the Treasury , the QE2 Centre , Westminster Abbey and , significantly , Brian Haw 's peace vigil in Parliament Square which given he was the intended target of this law has ironically survived .
We also know that the law will enable the police to impose conditions " as to the place at which the assembly may be ( or continue to be ) held , its maximum duration and the maximum number of persons who may constitute it . "
But as to the exact nature of the law we know nothing , as this too will be covered with law written after it is passed .
On the upside it looks like we can have as many banners at a demo as we want now .
Given Labour 's track record on civil liberties and the timing of its release we can only assume that far from repealing Socpa they have replaced it with Socpa lite .
Shameless :
The unrepentant mother who walked out on her five children and husband and began a new family
Marie walked out on her husband and five young children to be with a man she met on a university course .
Far from being repentant , she claims many other mothers would love to do the same
To see Marie Cartwright playing with her two - year - old son amid the toys on her sitting - room floor , you would think she was the very image of a devoted mother .
Indeed , she would argue that she could n't love her son any more than she does .
Ask her other five children , however , and you might get a very different opinion about her fitness as a mother .
Because the dramatic events which led to the 40 - year - old conceiving her son Alex have driven a wedge between Marie and the rest of her family - who simply cannot understand how she could be so callous .
Marie Cartwright with new partner Nick Boardman and son Alex .
She walked out on her husband and five children to begin a new life
So what did she do that so enraged them ?
In short , she abandoned her husband and five children for the sake of a younger lover whom she 'd met on a degree course in York .
Incredibly , Marie feels she was simply being brave in setting up home with her lover Nick , a 35 - year - old civil servant , and will not accept that she was selfish to leave so many children effectively motherless , even though her youngest child at the time was just a baby of 18 months .
Having also left behind Chloe , then one - and - a - half , Emma , five , James , 13 , Susan , 15 , and Jonathan , 17 , Marie immediately fell pregnant with her sixth child .
' People find it very hard to understand that I have sacrificed my children for Nick , ' she says .
' Some people will accuse me of being selfish , of putting my own needs and desires before those of my children .
' Not a day goes by that I do n't feel guilty for what I have put everyone through .
But I know deep down that I made the best choice - for them and for me . '
It 's certainly hard to see how leaving home could have been the best choice for her children .
Marie 's own parents and her four brothers have cut her off .
' I would wake up and relish the fact that for the first time in my adult life I did n't have to get up to see to domestic chores and children '
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Meanwhile , her daughter Susan , overwhelmed with bitterness at her mother 's betrayal , has accused her of abandonment .
And yet Marie claims she is simply misunderstood - that it is important for women like her , who feel trapped by marriage and motherhood , to rediscover their own identities without their children .
' Even today , the idea that a mother can leave her children , especially when they are so young , is severely frowned upon , ' says Marie .
' People often say I am brave to have chosen to live my life without five of my children .
I think it is something many women consider - and they might be happier if they did it - but they fear the reactions of others .
' Women are supposed to be so closely bonded with their children that they would never consider leaving them .
I believe this is changing and more mothers are realising there is another way . '
It is , to say the least , a provocative view , and one unlikely to hold much sway with the majority of parents .
Marie questions why it is that a mother leaving her children is so much less acceptable than a father doing the same .
But then it becomes clear , as Marie tells her story , that she is not like other mothers .
In the early days of her marriage , living in Pontefract in North Yorkshire , she thought she was cut out for family life .
The daughter of deeply traditional parents - her father worked in the coal industry while her mother stayed at home with the children - Marie looked set to follow in their footsteps when she left school and first married aged 17 .
Her husband Steve , an engineer , was 12 years her senior , but seven years after their church wedding - and having had her eldest children , Jonathan , Susan and James - the couple realised they 'd grown apart , and divorced .
Left behind : Marie with her then husband Roy and four of her five other children
Four years later , she met bar manager Roy and then became pregnant with daughter Emma .
The couple married in 2001 and two years later , Chloe was born .
At the time , says Marie , she was happy enough , and she and Roy began planning for the future .
Believing she had finished having children , Marie decided to go to university and become a teacher .
When Chloe was a year old , Marie was offered a place to study literature at university in York .
This was the turning point in her life .
' I 'd felt more alive than I had done for years , ' she says .
' I adored the quiet times in the library doing research , and the debates with fellow students . '
One of these students was Nick .
Marie admits she found him attractive and enjoyed their intellectual sparring , but adds : ' My mind was always on the children and Roy . '
Gradually , her home life began to suffer .
' The journey to York was about 45 minutes .
Often , it meant I was barely home to put the children to bed .
It put my relationship with Roy under terrible stress .
He felt he was having to do too much and we began to argue . '
Seen here pregnant with baby Alex
The couple decided to move nearer to York , and so the family bought a beautiful four - bedroom house close to the university .
It was then that her eldest three children , Jonathan , Susan and James , decided to move back to their father Steve 's home .
' The older children were welcome to come with us when we moved , but they did n't want to leave their friends and schools , ' she says .
' The house would have been a little cramped with seven of us , so they decided to stay with their dad because he lived nearby .
' I did n't feel guilty about this because I felt they were old enough to make their own choices .
They were welcome to stay with us and came to visit most weekends and I would speak to them during the week on the phone . '
But any chance of the move helping to ease the situation was ruined when , to help with their larger mortgage , she and Roy took on a lodger .
Marie says : ' I asked around the university and Nick said he was looking for a room . '
You might expect her to have thought twice about taking in a man she found attractive , but within days Nick was living under the same roof as Marie , Roy and the five children .
Not surprisingly , the arguments between Roy and Marie escalated .
Marie 's studies increasingly became an escape from the chaos of domestic life .
' Roy could n't understand why I spent so much time buried in my books , but because life was so hectic and noisy at home , I had to write in the library . '
Meanwhile , her relationship with Nick flourished .
' We had lots in common .
We would discuss the books we were reading and essays we had to write .
Perhaps Roy was jealous , but the studying pushed me further away from him and caused terrible rows . ' ,
One day in 2006 , after a fierce argument , Roy stormed out , taking their two daughters with him to stay with his mother .
Marie sought comfort from Nick , confiding in him about her unhappiness and even , a few days later , attending a Valentine 's ball with him at the university .
' People often say I am brave to have chosen to live my life without five of my children '
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
' He thought it would cheer me up to go , ' she says .
Before the night was out , she had fallen for him .
' When Nick found a little flower and presented it to me , I suddenly looked at him and felt a shiver of excitement that I had n't felt for anyone in years .
' Over the next few days , while Roy was with the children at his mother 's , my feelings grew stronger , and when a couple of weeks later Nick kissed me and we made love , it felt so right to be doing it . '
As if betraying her husband with another man was n't bad enough , the fact that Marie admits to enjoying that her children were no longer with her is even more disturbing .
' I would wake up and begin to relish the fact that for the first time in my adult life I did n't have to get up to see to domestic chores and children .
' Although part of me was devastated that the children were n't with me , another part of me loved the freedom , the fact I could study for as long as I liked and that no one was rowing with me about it .
' I was n't just someone 's wife or mother - I had my own identity and I did n't want to lose it again . '
The couple kept their affair secret .
But when Roy told Marie he wanted to try again to make their marriage work , Marie told him she did n't want to go back to her old life with him and the children .
' I remember I was in such turmoil because I knew then I loved Nick , ' she says .
' But I also knew leaving my family for him would devastate everyone . '
The mother - of - six pictured with Alex two days after giving birth to him
Discovering she was pregnant with Nick 's child convinced her she had to be with him - though many women will ask what one earth a mother of five was doing allowing herself to get pregnant with a sixth child at 38 .
' It was such a shock , ' she says , with some understatement .
' Telling Roy was absolutely terrible and he was devastated .
But by then I 'd made my choice . '
With Marie 's blessing , Roy took their two children and moved back to Pontefract .
Not surprisingly , the fallout was catastrophic .
' My mother thought it was " shameful " that I did n't want to make another go of my marriage , fight for custody of the children , or move back to Pontefract to be nearer the children .
While part of me longed to do that , the other part did n't want to give up my degree .
' And while Nick said he would support me whatever I did , we both felt that with me pregnant and both of us doing our degrees , having the children to live with us would be very unsettling for them . '
One can only imagine the utter bewilderment of her children .
Yet Marie insists Roy , who has now divorced her for adultery , and her children were better off without her .
' When I visited the children , I felt they were fine .
Roy is a good father and the others had become more used to him caring for them than me .
' He had managed to put the girls back in their old schools and they were surrounded by extended family to care for them while Roy worked . '
Even so , it is hard to comprehend how Marie could have believed that her children were better off without their mother - or that they would be able to cope with knowing that she was expecting another child .
Eventually , the enormity of what she had done did came home to her .
' I know deep down that I made the best choice - for them and for me '
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
' Roy said the girls did n't want to see me , and then when Emma came to visit one day she wanted to know why her Mummy did n't live with her .
She asked : " Is it because I was naughty ? "
It was heartbreaking and it did make me feel very guilty about what I 'd done to her . '
Not guilty enough to make her want to come home to them , though .
' By then , months had gone by and I felt trying for custody of the children would be more selfish than leaving them with Roy , where they were happy , ' she counters .
In 2007 , Marie 's sixth child Alex was born with heart problems .
The greatest irony of all perhaps is that she blames the stress of caring for him , combined with the guilt over leaving her children , for forcing her to give up her studies .
' Alex needed a life - saving operation and I lived at the hospital .
It meant I did n't see my other children for two months , ' she says .
' On our visits , when I finally began seeing them again , I 'd feel incredibly nervous .
I wondered if they wanted to see me .
' Although my older sons did n't seem as affected , my relationship with my eldest daughter was incredibly strained .
We would have enormous rows , where she would accuse me of abandoning her and everyone else .
Marie says she has no regrets
' That word " abandon " would upset me terribly because although I accept I left my children , I never felt I abandoned them .
I always saw them regularly , even if it was n't as often as I 'd like . '
Today , Marie sees her younger girls , now aged ten and six , once a fortnight , on birthdays and over Christmas ( although they spend Christmas Day with Roy ) .
She speaks to them most days on the phone .
' It is hard , ' she says .
' I ask them lots of questions , what they are doing at school , but they 're not always forthcoming .
I realise I am missing out on all the day - to - day events in their lives .
' I do worry as well that as they grow older they will miss having a mother more - although Susan , who 's now 20 , has taken over a motherly role in many ways .
' Another concern is that they will grow to resent me in their teens , and I quite expect them to accuse me of abandoning them , as Susan does . '
In her new life with Nick , Marie prefers , understandably , to let people think she is a mother of one .
' Although close friends knowhe circumstances , I find people can be very judgmental , which is upsetting , ' she says .
' They automatically assume I must be very cold - hearted .
The best way to cope is to grow a thick skin . '
Just how her children have tried to cope without their mother is another matter .
Yet Marie believes that her actions were justified .
' I could not stay in an unhappy marriage , waiting for 20 years until the children had left home , ' she insists .
' And I still believe that in leaving them with Roy I put them first .
' I hope that one day the children can forgive me , and see that I did n't do this lightly , ' she says .
That is , it must be said , a very big hope .
• Some names have been changed to protect the children involved .
The Wall Street Journal reports ( subscription required ) that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has opened an inquiry into Apple 's rejection of an official Google Voice application for the iPhone as well as the removal of numerous third - party applications offering Google Voice functionality .
In particular , the FCC is interested in AT&T 's role in the decision - making process .
In letters sent late Friday to the three companies , the FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related " third - party applications " from its store .
The letter also seeks information on how AT&T was consulted in the decision , if at all .
Apple and AT&T declined to comment on the inquiry , while Google representatives have not yet responded to requests for comments .
The inquiry , which is apparently part of broader investigations by the FCC and the Department of Justice of possible anti-competitive practices in the wireless industry primarily targeting AT&T and Verizon , was reportedly initiated by the FCC on its own and not prompted by any specific complaint to the agency .
Earlier today , Bloomberg reported that the FCC is also taking a close look at rural wireless markets that have no or limited coverage from the major wireless providers to determine how handset exclusivity agreements with those providers are unfairly hindering competition from the smaller carriers that service the rural markets .
Craigslist founder Craig Newmark . *
Photo : PLATON * The Internet 's great promise is to make the world 's information universally accessible and useful .
So how come when you arrive at the most popular dating site in the US you find a stream of anonymous come - ons intermixed with insults , ads for prostitutes , naked pictures , and obvious scams ?
In a design straight from the earliest days of the Web , miscellaneous posts compete for attention on page after page of blue links , undifferentiated by tags or ratings or even usernames .
Millions of people apparently believe that love awaits here , but it is well hidden .
Is this really the best we can do ?
Odd perhaps , but no odder than what you see at the most popular job - search site : another wasteland of hypertext links , one line after another , without recommendations or networking features or even protection against duplicate postings .
Subject to a highly unpredictable filtering system that produces daily outrage among people whose help - wanted ads have been removed without explanation , this site not only beats its competitors — Monster , CareerBuilder , Yahoo's HotJobs — but garners more traffic than all of them combined .
Are our standards really so low ?
But if you really want to see a mess , go visit the nation 's greatest apartment - hunting site , the first likely choice of anybody searching for a rental or a roommate .
On this site , contrary to every principle of usability and common sense , you can't easily browse pictures of the apartments for rent .
Customer support ?
Visit the help desk if you enjoy being insulted .
How much market share does this housing site have ?
In many cities , a huge percentage .
It is n't worth trying to compare its traffic to competitors ' , because at this scale there are no competitors .
Each of these sites , of course , is merely one of the many sections of craigslist , which dominates the market in facilitating face - to - face transactions , whether people are connecting to buy and sell , give something away , rent an apartment , or have some sex .
With more than 47 million unique users every month in the US alone — nearly a fifth of the nation 's adult population — it is the most important community site going and yet the most underdeveloped .
Think of any Web feature that has become popular in the past 10 years : Chances are craigslist has considered it and rejected it .
If you try to build a third - party application designed to make craigslist work better , the management will almost certainly throw up technical roadblocks to shut you down .
Craigslist is not only gigantic in scale and totally resistant to business cooperation , it is also mostly free .
The only things that cost money to post on the site are job ads in some cities ( $ 25 to $ 75 ) , apartment listings by brokers in New York ( $ 10 ) , and — in a special case born of recent legal trouble — advertisements in categories commonly used by prostitutes , because authorities encourage vendors to maintain a record that would aid investigators .
There is no banner advertising .
They wo n't let you join them , and at this price you can't beat them either .
At times it has occurred to people that the problems with craigslist could be solved by appealing to its eponym , Craig Newmark .
Newmark is under lots of pressure these days .
His company is being sued by eBay , a competitor and minority shareholder angry at being excluded from the company 's deliberations .
The attorney general of South Carolina has blustered about prosecuting his CEO for facilitating prostitution , and there have been strong challenges from law enforcement agencies in other states , too .
The tabloids have relentlessly played up stories about two so - called craigslist killers , one who allegedly used the site 's erotic - services section to lure victims and another who used the help - wanted ads .
Newmark responds to such criticism with extreme serenity .
Inquire about his finances and he talks about his hummingbird feeder .
When his Twitter page asks him , " What are you doing ? " he retweets in the voice of a squirrel .
" Run , run , run , " he says .
" Dig , dig . "
Though the company is privately held and does not respond to questions about its finances , it is evident that craigslist earns stupendous amounts of cash .
One recent report , from a consulting firm that counted the paid ads , estimates that revenue could top $ 100 million in 2009 .
Should craigslist ever be sold , the price likely would run into the billions .
Newmark , by these lights , is a very rich man .
When anybody reminds him of this , the craigslist founder says there is nothing he would care to do with that much money , should it ever come into his hands .
He already has a parking space , a hummingbird feeder , a small home with a view , and a shower with strong water pressure .
What else is he supposed to want ?
Frustration over these sorts of replies sometimes becomes comical .
In a July 2007 television interview , Charlie Rose spent half the program attempting to get Newmark to admit his good fortune , and failing .
" I do n't have anywhere near as much control as you think , " Newmark said .
" I 'm not talking how much control ; I 'm talking percentage of ownership , " Rose said .
Rose is usually kind to his guests , but the scent of unacknowledged wealth brought out his ferocity .
" Oh , same thing from my point of view , " Newmark said , trying to move the topic along .
" Do you own more than 50 percent of craigslist or not ? "
Rose asked .
" No . "
" You do n't ? "
" Correct . "
" In other words , other people own that , or you 've given it away or whatever . "
" Could be , Charlie . "
" OK , but I 'm — why are you so ...? "
" Coy ? "
" Yeah . "
" It does n't matter , " Newmark said .
" I mean ... "
" I know it does n't matter , " Rose repeated , his face a mask of pain .
Newmark 's claim of almost total disinterest in wealth dovetails with the way craigslist does business .
Besides offering nearly all of its features for free , it scorns advertising , refuses investment , ignores design , and does not innovate .
Ordinarily , a company that showed such complete disdain for the normal rules of business would be vulnerable to competition , but craigslist has no serious rivals .
The glory of the site is its size and its price .
But seen from another angle , craigslist is one of the strangest monopolies in history , where customers are locked in by fees set at zero and where the ambiance of neglect is not a way to extract more profit but the expression of a worldview .
The axioms of this worldview are easy to state .
" People are good and trustworthy and generally just concerned with getting through the day , " Newmark says .
If most people are good and their needs are simple , all you have to do to serve them well is build a minimal infrastructure allowing them to get together and work things out for themselves .
Any additional features are almost certainly superfluous and could even be damaging .
Newmark has been working hard to extend the influence of his worldview .
His public pronouncements have the delighted yet apologetic tone of a man who has stumbled on a secret hiding in plain sight and who finds it embarrassingly necessary to point out something that should long have been obvious .
He seems to have discovered a new way to run a business .
He suspects that it may be the right way to run the world .
Public spirited and mild - mannered , politically liberal and socially awkward , Newmark has one trait that mattered a lot in craigslist 's success :
He is willing to perform the same task again and again .
During the company 's first years , Newmark approved nearly every message on the list , and in the decade since he has spent much of his time eliminating offensive ones .
Even by the most conservative accounting , he has passed judgment on tens of thousands of classified ads .
Very few people could do this and thrive .
Newmark knows that he is not typical .
He tends to interpret things literally , and when he was younger other people often confused him .
In 1972 , while still a college student , he read Language in Thought and Action , the classic book on communication by S. I. Hayakawa , and it helped him understand himself better .
" All of a sudden I 'm thinking , ' It ca n't be that everyone else has a problem .
It has to be me , ' " he says .
We are sitting in a San Francisco coffee shop called Reverie Café Bar , where Newmark spends long hours and has given countless interviews .
Many things in his life are a matter of routine .
When he talks , he calls upon a repertoire of conversational gambits he has been collecting forever , and he has a selection of sound effects on his mobile phone , such as a cymbal crash , that he can trigger to make it clear he is joking .
When people misunderstand him , he does n't get upset .
" I'm the Forrest Gump of the Internet , " he says .
He loves customer service .
" I 'll only be doing this as long as I live , " he says .
He taps his phone , triggering a ghostly whaaahahaha .
" And after that , who knows ? "
Email has always been an ideal outlet for Newmark 's genial nature .
Craigslist began in 1995 as a mailing list with announcements of events of interest to technical people , and as more of them began to subscribe , he encouraged readers to post their own news , archived the messages on a Web page , and tried to make sure all the content was legitimate .
After Netscape 's IPO in August of that year , craigslist became a portal into the dotcom scene .
Within two years , he had thousands of readers , most of whom he did n't know .
This was a big responsibility for somebody who is not an extrovert .
" I used to email him every day , " says Christina Murphy , one of the first tech recruiters to use craigslist regularly .
" If I made a mistake in a job posting , I would have to call him and ask for a change .
It drove him insane . "
Murphy , along with an Internet consultant named Nancy Melone , began meeting with Newmark , trying to map out a more professional future for craigslist that did n't require its founder to take phone calls .
Job postings were an obvious source of revenue , and in 1998 they launched a nonprofit called List Foundation .
Recruiters would pay $ 30 for ads , everything else would be free , and any money left after paying the cost of upkeep and administration would be given away .
Melone was CEO .
Newmark 's willingness to cede so much control worried Murphy , who soon quit the venture .
" It was a beautiful , perfect little world , " she says .
" And it was being taken over by other forces . "
For nearly a year , the site was available at two URLs , craigslist.org and the less embarrassingly personal listfoundation.org .
But Melone and Newmark were pulling in different directions , or rather , Melone was pulling and Newmark was digging in his heels .
By the end of the decade , the Internet frenzy was at its peak and the smartest minds of the new industry all agreed that the right strategy was to get big fast in anticipation of a sale or an IPO .
Melone wanted to raise prices .
Newmark worried about charging for listings at all .
Melone wanted to become a dotcom ; Newmark was wedded to the idea that craigslist was a community service .
Melone was gregarious , a talker .
Newmark had vast powers of passive resistance .
A split was inevitable , and one day in late September 1999 , craigslist users who came in through the listfoundation.org address found themselves automatically bounced to a new , for - profit Web site , called MetroVox .
Run by Melone , it offered similar sorts of community listings and had a far more aggressive plan to grow .
Melone said that Newmark had authorized the switch ; Newmark announced that he'd been blindsided .
This was craigslist 's first serious competitive challenge , and perhaps its last .
Newmark had some personal qualities that ought to have been fatal in an entrepreneur .
Aside from his communication problems and an aversion to exerting authority , he cared nothing for entrepreneurship .
But in the battle with MetroVox he had an asset that more than compensated for these shortcomings :
For years he had worked on his site with an uncanny , machine - like constancy , doing all the painstaking and repetitive things that would make most people desperate with frustration and boredom , and he had done them happily .
And now his users paid him back in the most obvious possible way :
They stopped using the List Foundation address , resumed posting their free ads at craigslist.org , and emailed Newmark when problems occurred .
Less than a year later , the bubble burst and MetroVox faded away .
Newmark abandoned the idea of running craigslist as a nonprofit , which would have required him to learn and follow too many rules .
He realized that nobody could stop him from giving away his money if he made too much of it , and in the meantime he handed out a significant portion of his ownership to others as a way to avoid acquiring too much authority .
" I was worried about going middle - aged crazy , " he says .
He also put great distance between himself and any executive responsibility .
The current CEO , Jim Buckmaster , joined the site in 2000 as a programmer and handles every business and strategic issue .
It was Buckmaster who crafted the current strategy for growth — a slow , bloblike , seemingly unstoppable accretion of new craigslist cities , each an exact clone of the others , launched with no marketing or publicity .
Sometimes a new site grows very slowly for a long time .
But eventually listings hit a certain volume , after which the site becomes so familiar and essential that it is more or less taken for granted by everybody except the distressed publishers of local newspapers .
Revenue from newspaper classified ads is off nearly 50 percent in the past decade , a drop that comes to almost $ 10 billion .
Only a fraction of this loss is because of Newmark 's company , but as the largest online classified site , craigslist is easy to blame .
Because he is the founder of a remarkable Internet company that also happens to be helping the nation 's dailies go out of business , Newmark 's opinion is eagerly sought , and he spends an increasing amount of time at conferences and international meetings , where he attempts to answer questions about how to best defend the public interest in an era of cheap and ubiquitous media .
As we watch the birds on the patio of Reverie , Newmark tries out some of the phrases he is hoping to use in the coming months as he unfolds the lessons of craigslist .
" My big mission is to help make grassroots democracy as much a part of our government as representative democracy , " he says .
Jim Buckmaster was hired as a programmer in 2000 .
A year later he became CEO .
Platon , grooming by Tamara Brown / Artist Untied Many people who have heard Newmark 's public remarks find the ideals admirable but difficult to apply .
What would such an approach mean in practice ?
His cause is not helped by the fact that if the craigslist management style resembles any political system , it is not democracy but rather a low - key popular dictatorship .
Its inner workings are obscure , it publishes no account of its income or expenses , it has no obligation to respond to criticism , and all authority rests in the hands of a single man .
Ask Newmark about any feature you would like to see on craigslist and you will always get the same response .
" Ask Jim , " he says .
" How do you get your feedback ?
Have you ever done a poll or anything like that ? "
" The thought makes me tired .
But you can suggest that to Jim if you wish . "
" What if Jim says no ? "
" If you want to ask him again , you can , " he says .
At this point in our conversation I begin to feel the spirit of Charlie Rose upon me .
After all , Newmark is the founder , a major shareholder , and the public face of the company .
" What would it take to get you to fire Jim ? " I ask .
Newmark matches me mischief for mischief .
" Ask Jim . "
It is easy to find hypocrisy in the idealism of a business owner who prescribes democracy for others while relieving himself of the tiresome burden of democratic consultation in the domain where he has the most power .
But of course , craigslist is not a polity ; it is just an online classified advertising site , one that manages to serve some basic human needs with startling efficiency .
It is difficult to overstate the scale of this accomplishment .
Craigslist gets more traffic than either eBay or Amazon .com .
eBay has more than 16,000 employees .
Amazon has more than 20,000 .
Craigslist has 30 .
Craigslist may have little to teach us about how to make decisions , but that 's not the aspect of democracy that concerns Newmark most .
He cares about the details , about executing all the little obvious things we'd like government to do .
" I 'm not interested in politics , I 'm interested in governance , " he says .
" Customer service is public service . "
Last year Newmark got about 195,000 email messages .
He estimates that roughly 60 percent were spam .
He read all the rest and replied to many .
He has a boss now , a customer service manager named Clint Powell , who was hired about six years ago .
But he maintains his habits for reasons that have little to do with the normal logic of work .
They are part of his identity , an unconventional mode of self - realization through which he took hold of a barrier that always separated him from the world and made it into a kind of performance .
Athletes compete .
Artists create .
Newmark answers email .
He knows that this will seem absurd from the outside , but he is blessed not to care .
In fact , he likes to treat people to a laugh when he can .
It 's sometimes impossible to discern his intention exactly , and this is essential to the effect .
On our way out of the cafè , I step aside to let Newmark go ahead , and he walks face - first into the plate glass door .
Jim Buckmaster is tall and thin , Newmark is short and round , and when they stand together they look like a binary number .
In 2004 , I saw them give a talk in which Newmark , who is 5 ' 7 " , stood on a milk crate and was still barely eye - to - eye with his CEO , who is 6 ' 7 " .
It was a memorable performance , but they do n't have much opportunity for the gag these days because their joint appearances are rare .
At the craigslist office , the two men work in the same room , but their desks are set up so they sit back - to - back .
They are not social friends , and in fact they almost never talk .
Newmark does not excel at chitchat , and Buckmaster is a quiet type , too .
Buckmaster dropped out of medical school at the University of Michigan in 1986 .
He hung around the university for 10 years , studying the classics , doing data entry work , and teaching himself programming .
By 1999 , he was working as a webmaster in San Francisco for a dotcom called Creditland , where he was not happy .
" The marketing side had attained ascendancy , " he says .
He posted his résumé on craigslist , and Newmark found it .
Craigslist was very unlike Creditland .
" It was n't even really clear who decided to hire me , " Buckmaster says .
He looked around and began finding things to do .
He wrote forum software to give users a chance to interact .
When he realized that every post had to be reviewed and published by hand , he created the automated process that allowed craigslist to grow .
He coded a search engine .
A year after he arrived he was CEO .
There was no competition for the job , no ritual transfer of power , and no instructions .
" In the entire time I 've been here , I do n't think Craig has ever said to me , ' This is the way it has to be , ' " Buckmaster says .
The only topic he can remember their disagreeing about is the peace sign that adorns the craigslist Web address .
" Craig thought it was associated with the hippies and that hippies were discredited , " Buckmaster says .
" Whereas I think peace is among the most desirable things you can have . "
The long - running tech - industry war between engineers and marketers has been ended at craigslist by the simple expedient of having no marketers .
Only programmers , customer service reps , and accounting staff work at craigslist .
There is no business development , no human resources , no sales .
As a result , there are no meetings .
The staff communicates by email and IM .
This is a nice environment for employees of a certain temperament .
" Not that we 're a Shangri - La or anything , " Buckmaster says , " but no technical people have ever left the company of their own accord . "
The purity of this culture is its most tenaciously guarded asset .
A few years ago , Phillip Knowlton , a Bay Area psychologist who was on the craigslist staff in the site 's early years , sold his 28 percent stake in the company to eBay .
Buckmaster and Newmark approved eBay founder Pierre Omidyar , himself a programmer , as the representative of eBay on the craigslist board .
But at that point , Omidyar no longer ran eBay , and he was replaced by an eBay vice president who had overseen the acquisition of a craigslist competitor in Europe .
When eBay launched a competing service in the US , Buckmaster responded by reorganizing craigslist and weakening eBay 's influence .
The companies have since sued each other .
While the dueling complaints hinge on questions of stock dilution and conflict of interest , it is hard to imagine any conventional business executive being satisfied with the way craigslist operates .
What kind of company declares itself uninterested in maximizing profit ?
" Companies looking to maximize revenue need to throw as many revenue - generating opportunities at users as they will tolerate , " Buckmaster says .
" We have absolutely no interest in doing that , which I think has been instrumental to the success of craigslist . "
Buckmaster and I talk in the San Francisco penthouse condo of Susan MacTavish Best , who owns a small PR company .
Best and Buckmaster lived together as a couple for five years .
Though they are now separated , they remain friends , and she continues to serve as a kind of translation mechanism by which the hints and silences of craigslist management are converted into responses suitable for the press .
Queries , in recent months , have concerned mostly sex and violence .
That the world would expect craigslist to take responsibility for the rare violent criminal who lures victims through an ad strikes Buckmaster as absurd .
He points to the thousands of people who die every year in auto accidents .
" Does anybody call up the head of GM and say , ' Somebody just got killed using your product ?
How can you sleep at night ?
Do n't you realize that a person is dead ? ' "
Buckmaster 's dispassionate protest reflects his cast of mind .
Emotional appeals are more likely to provoke his skepticism than his sympathy , and when the complaints come from aspiring Internet entrepreneurs he is especially prone to sarcasm .
He hears many such complaints , because one of the most curious things about craigslist is that a company designed and run entirely by programmers is so hostile to outsiders who want to pull neat technical tricks to improve the site .
A few years ago , independent programmer Jeff Atwood created a service that would allow people to search multiple cities at once or even search craigslist globally .
Buckmaster arranged some technical interference to kill it off .
Another programmer named Ryan Sit created a service called Listpic , which scraped images from craigslist and dumped them into an interface for browsing :
You could scan through all the photos from the apartment listings or see pictures of all the dogs up for adoption .
Buckmaster banished Listpic , too .
He had specific objections to both .
Listpic ran ads , it put a high burden on craigslist servers , and when he looked at traffic records he noticed that Listpic was being used mainly to enhance enjoyment of the sexy images people posted in their erotic - services ads .
Universal search subverts craigslist 's mission to enable local , face - to - face transactions ; it increases the risk of scams and can be exploited to snatch up bargains , giving technically sophisticated users an advantage over casual browsers .
But the very surfeit of these practical objections — many of which probably have technical solutions — hints that the real explanation lies elsewhere , and with a minimum of pressure Buckmaster will state it plainly .
It is the same reason that craigslist has never done any of the things that would win approval among Web entrepreneurs , the same reason he has never updated its 1999 - era Web design .
The reason is that craigslist 's users are not asking for such changes .
" I hear this all the time , " Buckmaster says .
" You guys are so primitive , you are like cavemen .
Do n't you have any sense of aesthetic ?
But the people I hear it from are invariably working for firms that want the job of redoing the site .
In all the complaints and requests we get from users , this is never one of them .
Time spent on the site , the number of people who post — we 're the leader .
It could be we 're doing one or two things right . "
This ends the debate for him , but his tone is oddly non-triumphal ; in fact , Buckmaster 's statement of fealty to users has a weary sound that I do n't understand until weeks later .
Only after I have spent every spare hour on craigslist — browsing the ads , tracking the spam , reading the help forums , contacting users — do I finally begin to grasp something of his situation .
The truth is that a lot of people complain about craigslist .
Buckmaster is correct that few of them complain about the design .
They complain about spam , they complain about fraud , they complain about the posting rules , they complain about the search , they complain about uploading images .
They complain about every way a classified transaction can go wrong .
They seldom complain about amazing new features they imagine they might possibly want to use , because they are too busy complaining about the simple features they depend on that do n't work as well as they 'd like .
By eliminating marketing , sales , and business development , craigslist 's programmers have cut out all the cushioning layers that separate them from the users they serve , and any right they have to teach lessons in public service comes from the odd situation of running a company that is directly subservient only to the public .
Here 's the lesson :
The public is a motherfucker .
Craig Newmark says that craigslist works because people are good , and he has stuck to this point of view without wavering .
Whether you accept it as true will depend on your standard of goodness .
Sometimes entire categories of craigslist are rendered nearly unusable by spam .
Con artists prowl the listings , paying sellers with fake cashier 's checks and luring buyers to share their credit card numbers .
Other evils are more subtle .
Business owners whose judgment is distorted by self - interest fail to understand the rules and put the same item in multiple categories or repost it many times a day to insure it stays prominent , crowding out other sellers .
A woman listing a car forgets to tell buyers about problems with the title until they 've made a long trip out to see it .
In all transactions there is a possibility of misunderstanding as well as abuse , and at 99.99 percent perfection there would still be thousands of angry people every month .
Newmark says that craigslist works because people are good .
The battle flows back and forth .
Captchas — distorted words that can be interpreted by humans more easily than by machines — tamed spam on craigslist for a while .
Then it came back full force , not because the spammers had solved the difficult problem in artificial intelligence but because they had hacked an easier problem in global economics .
I recently established a friendly email dialog with a young man in Dhaka , Bangladesh , who works on a 13 - person team that creates craigslist spam .
He fills in Captchas , creates new accounts with masked IP addresses , and posts ads all day long using text from a database provided by his employer , an anonymous spam king .
The going price for a spam post on craigslist is about 50 cents , with large discounts for volume .
When I told Buckmaster about my new friend , he took the news calmly .
" These are technically sophisticated people who take pride in their work , and when we knock them down they do n't just decide to go find something else to do .
You could say we are breeding the perfect spammer . "
Without a computer science research department to work on evil - fighting algorithms , or a call center to take complaints , Buckmaster has settled on a different approach , one that involves haiku .
The little poems he has written appear on the screen at times when users might expect a helpful message from the staff .
They function as a gnomic clue that what you are seeing is intentional , while discouraging further conversation or inquiry .
For instance , start too many conversations in the forums and your new threads may fail to show up .
Instead , you will see this :
frogs croak and gulls cry
silently a river floods
a red leaf floats by
Attempt to post a message that is similar to one you 've already entered , and this may appear :
a wafer thin mint
that 's been sent before it seems
one is enough , thanks
The slight delays in cognitive processing that these haiku cause are valuable .
They open a space for reflection , during which you can rethink your need for service .
But haiku can't solve everything .
Supporting the poems are tens of thousands of users who are willing to devote two or three seconds of time to flag inappropriate ads or forum posts .
Too many flags on an advertisement and it will vanish .
The staff can lower the number of flags required to vaporize an ad if they want to clean out an especially polluted category , and they can raise the threshold if people grow flag - happy .
Users whose listings are flagged off the site get no hint as to what they may have done to attract ire .
Instead , they are directed to the " flag help " forum , where pseudonymous volunteers will offer an educated guess while having some fun at their expense .
Last spring a baffled user posted a query about why her ferrets - for - sale ad disappeared .
Within 60 seconds there was this reply : " Train the ferrets to read the terms of use .
Maybe they can help you out next time .
Pet sales are prohibited on this site . "
An ad can be flagged off the site for any reason .
Reject too many people for a job opening and they may flag your ad in spite every time they see it — and every new ad you post , too .
Describe yourself as incredibly handsome and cynical date - seekers may flag you as a favor to the innocent .
The claim that craigslist , used by millions of strangers , is somehow a democracy begins to be believable exactly here , in the crotchets , irritations , prejudices , and minor forms of harassment that characterize life in a small town where any proposal you make is subject to the judgment of everybody .
Flag something as inappropriate in the discussion forums , where craigslist employees have the final word about what goes , and these lines appear .
thanks for flagging this
staff will look at it shortly
hey , a dragonfly !
Buckmaster 's sly haiku evokes an entire scene .
Somewhere , at this moment , an innocent party is staring at a computer screen , furious at an offensive remark .
Somebody else is fruitlessly trading insults with volunteers on the help desk .
A third person is checking the site again and again , looking for a listing that was submitted but never appeared .
All craigslist can offer at these moments is a shrug and a joke , in the style of a Dilbert cartoon .
This is old - fashioned .
But craigslist is old - fashioned in any number of ways .
It relies on email and the telephone in an era of SMS and social networks .
It sticks to traceless transactions in an industry that makes its living collecting data from every touch .
And just as people who run technical companies are reaching an apex of confidence in their ability to invent new forms of community based on sharing everything , craigslist still treats social life as dangerously complex , deserving the most jaded caution .
Corporate isolation , user anonymity , refusal of excessive profit , glacial adoption of new features :
These all signal Newmark and Buckmaster 's wariness about what humans , including themselves , might do if given the chance .
There may be a peace sign on every page , but the implicit political philosophy of craigslist has a deeply conservative , even a tragic cast .
Every day the choristers of the social web chirp their advice about openness and trust ; craigslist follows none of it , and every day it grows .

Recently by Ron Paul : Healthcare
Is a Good , Not a Right
Before the Committee on Financial Services , Humphrey Hawkins Hearing on Monetary Policy , U.S. House of Representatives , July 21 , 2009
Mr. Chairman , at a time when we find ourselves once again receiving a report on the Federal Reserve ’s conduct of monetary policy , it is more important than ever that we in the Congress push for more effective oversight and transparency of the Federal Reserve System .
It would be unconscionable for this body , especially after the financial crisis of the last two years , not to take forceful and deliberate action to bring more transparency to the Fed .
A common misconception is that the Fed is completely independent of political pressure , and that any attempt to oversee or audit the Fed would jeopardize that independence .
While the Fed has far too much authority to make agreements with foreign governments and central banks , or create temporary liquidity facilities , the governors and , more importantly , the chairman , are appointed by the President .
The chairman is the dominant figure within the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee , the public face of the Fed , and he must be reappointed by the President every four years , with the advice and consent of the Senate .
Thus , his job security as chairman is dependent on keeping the President and the Senate pleased .
Every time the chairman acts , it is with the knowledge that within four years he will be forced to justify his actions to the President and the Senate .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee , the committee responsible for conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates , are held in secret .
Minutes are released after three weeks , and transcripts after five years .
The ostensible reasons for this secrecy are that too much openness will either hamper the freedom of FOMC participants to discuss issues freely , or that markets will be unnerved .
However , this is not really a condemnation of transparency , but rather a sign that far too much power has been given to one tiny organization .
We here in the Congress hold our committee hearings publicly , broadcast on C - SPAN and over the Internet .
We are the most powerful branch of the government and our decisions have no less effect on the lives of everyday Americans than the decisions of the Fed .
More importantly , our discussions have a direct impact on our ability to win re-election .
Every word we speak can be used against us in our campaigns for re-election .
It would be far easier for us to hold hearings in secret and release minutes and transcripts well after the fact .
Yet we understand that the American people deserve to know not only what comes out of Congress , but also what goes on in the legislative process .
In the same way , it is vital that the American people understand what is going on inside the Fed .
Attempts at enhanced transparency and auditing of the Fed ’s auctions are not intended to dictate monetary policy to the Fed or second - guess the Fed ’s actions .
To my knowledge not a single legislative proposal put forward thus far has this as its intended goal .
We as Congressmen have the ultimate responsibility for keeping the Fed in check , but how can we fulfill that duty if we do not know what the Fed is doing ?
Greater transparency is the first step , and only then can we begin to perform effective oversight .
Given the Fed ’s abysmal stewardship of the dollar and repeated fumbling of financial crises , we owe this to the American people .

The Best of Ron Paul
Three of our last four presidents have been left - handed :
Bush I : Left - handed
Clinton : Left - handed
Bush II : Right - handed
Obama : Left - handed
The same would be true if John McCain had won the last election — he ’s a leftie too .
Indeed , fully half of American presidents since Truman have been southpaws , though only 10 percent of the general population is left - handed .
What accounts for this ?
Who knows ?
But UCLA geneticist Daniel Geschwind says , “ Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant , and probably means something . ”
For nearly two weeks , 8 - year - old Samuel Gross lay in a hospital bed , locked in a coma as his family waited and prayed for a miracle .
After 13 days of waiting , those prayers were finally answered when Samuel opened his eyes and said " ouch . "
The boy nearly drowned on April 9 , when he fell and was sucked into a culvert by gushing water near his home in flood - soaked southern Manitoba .
In total , Samuel spent 20 minutes underwater until his cousin managed to pull his small , limp body to safety .
The boy 's father , Robert Gross , told CTV Winnipeg on Thursday that the family was " overjoyed that our prayers have been answered . "
Despite spending nearly two weeks unconscious , Gross said his young son appeared to be cognizant shortly after opening his eyes on Wednesday .
" He knew my phone number , he knew how old he was , when his birthday was -- things you would say are complicated to remember if you come out of something like that , " said Gross , speaking to reporters at Winnipeg Children 's Hospital .
Samuel fell into the fast - moving creek while playing with friends at Westroc Hutterite Colony , which is about 130 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg .
On Thursday , cousin Julie Gross recalled the moments before she pulled Samuel 's limp , icy body to safety .
" It was like this high , I think , the water , " she said , raising her hand high above the creek which has since receded back to its normal size .
" That 's when he fell through ... he went in and the suction pulled him down and he got sucked through the culvert . "
Not long after he was pulled from the water , Samuel was airlifted to Winnipeg 's Children 's Hospital with no pulse .
Doctors performed CPR on him for about two hours .
However , while the icy water nearly drowned Samuel , its temperature may have actually saved his life , according to Dr. Murray Kesselman , pediatric ICU medical director at the Children 's Hospital .

The following paper is a compilation of responses from Australia 's technology entrepreneurial community , via the Silicon Beach community , in relation to the following question :
What do we need to tell Australia 's government to build our technology industry ?
The goal of this document is to encourage discussion around the subjects of technology innovation and investment - to foster the growth of Australian technology companies .
The authors hope that consideration of this document will lead to more effective and supportive government policies - ultimately leading Australia towards hosting a stronger , more innovative and globally competitive technology industry .
The components
This paper clusters suggestions from over 30 Silicon Beach community members against three core themes : environment , investment , and people .
The paper itself was edited separately by another 30 people to varying degrees .
Contentious points were discussed in the public forum that makes up the near 600 + people on the Silicon Beach mailing list .
If the government implemented progressive policies in all of these themes , the majority view of the Silicon Beach community is that this will create a better future for Australia - economically and environmentally .
Building a world - class technology industry is not easily achieved .
Governments around the world have spent billions of dollars in attempts to replicate the success of Silicon Valley , the world 's most famous and effective technology centre .
How Silicon Valley came to be :
http://ipc-lis.mit.edu/globalization/Silicon%20Valley.pdf
A history that claims that it was an aggregation of electronics companies , brought together by military and government R&D spending , that led to a cascading effect on the local environment .
The secret of Silicon Valley can
not be replicated with money .
It was developed and cultivated over decades .
We need to start with clarity on the actual goals .
Identifying the problem
Before we can have a constructive discussion on how to improve the technology start - up process in Australia , we must identify what we want to improve , and why .
Do we want to recognise Australian success and the industry already built ?
There ’s already one Australian company ( Rocksoft ) that leads the world in a technique that has become a must - have for the data storage industry .
Their work has been copied by several billion - dollar companies .
Almost no - one knows about them .
Information technology and telecommunications employs more than 300,000 people in Australia .
Do we want it to employ more ?
If so , what will they be doing ?
Australia has many successful IT exporters .
Do we want more ?
Australia has many successful IT innovators .
Could there be more ?
Australian IP often finds a home offshore .
Is this a concern that needs to be addressed ?
Australia has not produced a single breakout global success despite having a track record of successful innovation in other areas .
Many people in the technology community feel that we ought to have had such a success by now .
Is this cultural cringe or a real concern ?
The Silicon Beach community 's response to all of the points above is Yes .
But that is not what we ultimately want .
These are simply characteristics of a bolder goal .
What we
want
is for Australia to be recognized as an undisputed global centre for technology innovation .
When a
n
American or European
Internet
company wishes to have Asian headquarters , Australia should always top the list .
If an ent
re
preneur wants to learn from the best before s/he strikes it on their own , they should lose sleep trying to decide whether to go to Silicon Valley – or
it
s Southern Hemisphere rival , Silicon Beach .
Wealth , jobs and international prestige occur once we have a thriving innovation industry .
Rather than getting sidetracked by the affects of a strong sector , let us focus on and describe how the world will react to the industry we build here , in Australia - o ne that could generate envy in tech centres around the world .
Understanding the solutions
While the term ' ICT sector ' is popular in government 's language , it places software company Atlassian ( contributor of 20 % of Australia 's software exports ) ; social media art community Red Bubble ( by the same founder of the high - profile Dot Com company " Lycos " in the 1990s ) and Telstra ( Australia 's dominant telecommunications company ) in the same bucket .
They exist in a similar ecosystem , with cross pollination of ideas and shared talent .
But it is dangerously misleading for Australia 's future success if the government considers their needs as being identical .
These diverse companies should not be considered as a monolithic group .
Within the nominal " ICT sector " , these diverse companies have different interests , different requirements for government assistance , and different problems with regulation .
Another way of looking at the ' ICT ' sector is to consider the business cycle .
T here are four stages companies go through : startup , growth , maturity , and decline .
Companies require different types of support at different stages .
Startup and growth ICT companies have different requirements for success than mature or declining companies .
For example , acquiring talented employees is far more critical for a start - up than for established firms ; therefore government taxation of share options ( used to entice top tier talent by offering significant upside to employees ) is a significant disadvantage for new local companies who cannot offer the salaries of more established competitors .
This paper particularly seeks to address ' ICT ' companies in their startup and growth phases .
Technology entrepreneurs in Australia lack the support networks found in major innovation hubs .
The Silicon Beach mailing list was created a year ago , to help connect technology entrepreneurs interested in starting their own business in technology .
A large proportion of the entrepreneurs in Australian information technology have some link to this community , and it has quickly become a rallying point for building the local industry .
Below are suggestions proposed by people in the community .
It ’s not conclusive n or complete , but it ’s a start .
A large number feel the government ca n’t do much other than “ staying out of the way ” , and would best act in the interests of Australian start - ups by doing nothing , and allowing the market to decide who succeeds .
However , other people suggested specific initiatives that that can inform government policy in the longer - term goal of encouraging the development of technology - developed enterprise .
The suggestion s have been clustered into six core strategic goals .
Theme Strategic goal
What success would look like if achieved People
The top t alent
The world ’s talent feel Australia is the leading place in Asia to learn how to create a technology business , develop technology , or work for emerging technology companies .
Unique innovation c ulture Australians list the local technology industry as one they are most proud of .
The world points to Australia ’s innovations as ones they wish to mimic .
Environment World class i nfrastructure
Australia ’s internet access ( wired , wireless .
mobile ) is the fastest , cheapest , and most accessible in the world .
Internationally competitive i ncentives
Every multinat ional in the technology sector consider it strategically desirable to have their headquarters and R&D labs in Australia .
Investment Better c apital availability Investors consider Australia the most attractive environment to place their capital in emerging technology businesses .
Entrepreneurs can find the capital they need at a fair price .
A self - managed r einvestment scheme People have incentives to reinvest their capital and skills into the next generation of emerging companies within Australia , beyond simply feeling a patriotic duty to the nation .
Should these goals be achieved , Australia will be make a compelling positioning as a global innovation centre for technology .
Below are specific solutions in response to the above goals .
Talent
T hree approaches were identified in which the government can assist with to develop and attract the best talent .
Better education to skill up Australian students
Universities can be a useful breeding ground for entrepreneurs .
For example , university unions help fund clubs and societies that can give practical experience in organizational building and management .
University research , thought leadership and exchange programs can allow students to explore their ideas and learn from others .
Stanford University , by way of example , has things like " Entrepreneuship Thought Leaders " , where they invite successful entrepreneurs back to university and share the experience .
Similarly , strong engineer and product skills are required to develop technology companies .
A cross industry issue related to Australian universities that was identified by the Silicon Beach community was that students lack practical skills that make them useful following graduatio n .
There are many ways this can be address through work experience whilst at university , more opportunities to conduct independent research ; and develop workplace skills through student ' companies ' .
Make it easier to get visas to bring in the top international talent .
The Silicon Beach community has identified that there is significant difficulty in securing visas for some of the top computer science graduates overseas .
To get the best talent , we need to remove these hurdles .
The world ’s best are self - selecting – let them move here to pursue their passions .
One entrepreneur recounts his experience as unbelievably tiring , expensive and procedural - for example , his work experience whilst studying at university was excluded when determining his overall experience .
Silicon Valley is renown for having foreign nationals working in all the major tech companies .
It is full of international employees - including many Australians - who come for several years and later return home after making money and gaining experience .
This has the potential to be the single biggest way the government can make an impact .
Encourage multinationals to build an experienced local population
Silicon Valley really began with s ilicon chip factories , with people forming bonds at those companies and then using their wealth to invest and build new companies , leading to a cascading effect over time .
Ireland ’s placing in Europe and its favourable tax environment had several companies relocate their European headquarters to the country , which has had a waterfall effect on the local ecosystem .
The encouragement of multinationals will skill up the local workforce , bring in the world ’s best talent , and see a transfer of knowledge and skills .
Google ’s office in Australia has invented two of the most important products since its original innovation of search : Google Maps and Google Wave .
( More specifically , Google acquired a Melbourne startup that became Google Maps ; and the same founders of that startup in their capacity as senior management , are what drove Google Wave - what could become one of the global company 's most innovative inventions to date . )
This not only has put Australia on the map as a place of innovation and attention due to the development of these technologies , but the local developer ecosystem also has benefited as they get upskilled by Google .
We should see every major brand in technology have Australia as a major base of operations and R&D , as it benefits the local industry dramatically .
Culture
Culture is key in the development of industry .
There is not much the government can do in this regard ( although it can do plenty to stifle it ) , other than to support community efforts like Silicon Beach and The Hive .
The involvement of government officials in social events , the funding of social events , and other soft ways of support - is how the government can assist with the development of the culture needed to build repeat word - class technology businesses .
Having clear avenues for funding events and communities removes one clear barrier for those looking to improve and expand the culture within this industry .
Australian entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley said the culture was the most important thing that needs to change .
It 's a culture that makes the environment more supportive ie , they claim they are surrounded by ten times more useful people to give them advice .
One member in the community said we need to politely get our local entrepreneurs go walkabout for a few years , and come back once they 've learned something from the world 's best .
The E3 visa negotiated under the US - Australia free trade agreement - and unique to Australian's - has become a very valuable tool to enable this .
The government supporting entrepreneurs , engineers , and other professions to move to Silicon Valley , build their networks , and learn from the best , is what long term will transform the industry .
Already a strong expat community exists , that will serve as a useful channel to boost Australian capability - this is organically growing .
The government can do something by recognising this and supporting programs that create " secondments " .
This is a simple , cheap , and powerful way to change the culture of Australia forever - as once a solid group of veterans return back to Australia , they guide future generations .
Infrastructure
This goal is dominated by the need for faster , better , cheaper internet access .
The Rudd government ’s National Broadband Network is seen as a positive step for Australia by the Silicon Beach community , with South Korea providing a clear precedent in the benefits .
In Korea 's case , near - universal high - speed broadband created new demand in the consumer population who previously had not realised what they lacked .
A similar example in Western countries is the growth of YouTube , which grew on the back of rising broadband penetration in Western countries .
Where the Silicon Beach community did voice concern was over the implementation of the NBN .
If several points were not addressed , the network could waste its potential .
T hree things stand out that can be used as guiding points on the proposed NBN .
Focus not just on the domestic data pipes but on the international haul
An insular NBN with the same back haul / contention ratios currently experienced in Australia to the global internet would be counter productive .
Without allocating , say , 20 % of money to the international data pipes , the 80 % that would be spent on the development of a national broadband network is considered useless .
The submarine lines on the sea beds that connect Australia to Asia and America are ultimately the bottlenecks for any Internet in Australia .
With the move to cloud computing and the decentralised nature of the internet , having appropriate links to the international network is key for speed .
A huge growth opportunity that could be coupled with the Climate change policies being led by the Rudd Government , is that of data centres .
( Cloud computing , the biggest trend in technology now , relies on massive data centres where energy is a key cost – with solutions a key competitive advantages .)
However , unless we are in a data path to other resources on the global internet map , or can entice the Americas , EMEA and Asia Pacific to use us for something we will remain a backwater .
The NBN needs to be government managed as a wholesale network
There is concern that , depending on the way the ownership of the NBN is structured , it will affect the competitiveness of ubiquitous connectivity .
Policies needs to be designed that ensure that the internet in Australia is the cheapest in the world .
A replication of the Telstra stor y will make the NBN a liability for the Australia economy and a constant source of political pain .
No clean feed
Amongst the Silicon Beach community there was a universal denouncement of the Rudd government 's proposed approach for filtration of the internet .
The Silicon Beach
community
– many of whom are responsible parents themselves – oppose it on commercial , philosophical , and practical grounds .
It is believed the only group to truly benefit from this scheme will be the companies that will provide the software to the government to run this .
A detailed letter was sent to Australian senators addressing this very issue in late 2008 .
As a separate point outside of the NBN , suggestions were made that could reduce the cost of inputs for startup businesses .
Subsidised or free spaces to operating businesses in , and making tech equipment cheaper , were cited as two ways in which they could help substantially .
Incentives
The improvement of incentives falls into three areas : tax , research , and leveling the playing field .
1 ) Tax
Tax , it was remarked by a Silicon Beacher , is what created the Persian wars , the American revolution , the French Revolution – and many other great changes in society .
A carefully crafted tax policy , could tra nsform Australia ’s competitiveness overnight for the long term .
Policy on tax is complex , but below are suggestion s that can be considered for initial discussion .
Change the new ESOP policy .
The Silicon Beach community has express ed anger at the new ESOP changes following the 2009 budget .
Share options are one of the major ways startups globally give incentive to top tier talent that would otherwise go to large companies .
The policy approach is seen as a blunt attack that could be better targeted , and preferably , removed .
Tax breaks .
Areas where targeted tax breaks could be implemented are
R&D investments .
In addition to reducing the cost of business for this research - intensive sector , more prominent impacts would be multinationals relocating their R&D centres to Australia , which upskill the local industry .
Having said that , the current R&D tax allowances have been considered very helpful .
Investors in startups .
Angel investors play a fundamental role in the capital ecosystem , as they typically fund a concept that can go to launch – which latter get funded by venture capitalists , whose role is when a company has a market presence .
By giving tax breaks to legitimate angels , it will see those with capital redirecting their wealth into the engine room of the economy .
CGT on companies building value .
The exit of a startup is core to the Internet industry , and capital gains on this exit has the potential to motivate or disincentivise market participants .
Startups in the first two years .
A functional definition of a startup is one whose revenues do not exceed its operating costs .
It typically takes a few years for a startup to graduate to a growth business , which is when they pay actual tax – so a policy exempting startups in their first two years would have minimal impact to government taxation revenues .
However , to eliminate most taxes on the first two years of a startup , will have global entrepreneurs and investors wanting to start their business in Australia with a stronger motivation to build revenue quicker .
Create a tax - free economic corridor .
There is a lot of thought that needs to go into this which wo n't be detailed here , but the concept is simple and has proven to work in a variety of Asian countries in the past .
As a case in point , lower tax has such a powerful motivator , that dozens of global companies have restructured their operations in such a way , that all money flows through Ireland .
By identifying a 50 by 50 km radius somewhere in Australia where companies with a certain criteria are tax free for 10 - 20 years , in the medium term a transformation could occur in Australia 's competitiveness that will last for the long term .
Payroll tax .
Although this is a state tax , it ’s a common complaint by the Silicon Beach community .
Some sort of arrangement that exempts small business will see more people being hired by startups .
2 ) Innovation and research grants
Any sort of government contribution to research could have a positive impact .
This could be done through increasing the availability of research grants .
The Silicon Beach community identified three problems with most government grant programs :
The requirement for matching funds .
Until a technology startup is producing revenue , or has attracted significant external investment , it will not have spare cash .
This is a particular issue in the technology sector , where the low costs of software development and online promotion mean that businesses can be , and usually are , started with low capital investments .
This means that most start - ups - regardless of their merit or potential - will simply not have the matching funds available to match a grant , and thus are ineligible .
Government attitude to the ICT sector .
More imagination from funding bodies about what truly small tech companies can offer has been requested .
One respondent from Silicon Beach believes his recent experience with the Climate Ready grant scheme and AusIndustry shows that ICT is not a government priority – an AusIndustry Customer Service Manager said that they automatically put applications for software R&D towards the bottom of the pile and discouraged him from applying .
This anecdote of a government official engaging in de facto economic planning is disturbing .
Onerous time requirements to apply .
The sheer amount of time and effort required to prepare and follow through with an application for government grants distracts from the actual activities required to run , and grow , the business .
This is an especially acute problem in technology start - ups where founders , and early employees will already be extremely busy .
The allocation of time to preparing a grant ( which may not even be approved ) is often not considered effective .
3 ) Level the playing field
The Silicon Beach community believes certain industries receive far better attention , and that information technology companies should be included in various industry specific programs .
Movies for example get a tax deduction , which it was remarked , leads onto to a red carpet launch ; technology startups on the other hands , offer a massive multipler with sustained employment but with no such tax benefits .
Capital
It was remarked by many that the funding lifecycle is broken in many areas .
The angel investor network is not considered strong enough ; the venture capital industry is considered under - developed in Australia .
Banks offering small business loans have proven to be ineffective for most startups
A review of the funding lifecycle is requested , with targeted initiatives to fix gaps .
Specific suggestions that could assist include building the local VC industry by offering matching funds ; also initiatives that strengthen the pipeline of startups invested by angels that can feed through to venture capital .
Additionally , it was suggested another good funding scheme through the government could help .
Reinvestment
Reinvestment can assist with capital , demand , and innovation .
The reinvestment of capital and skills into the industry is ho w it can grow over time to one o f the world ’s best .
S pecific initiatives that can assist this can help the long term prospects of the industry .
Government actions in the way it operates is an indirect way is can reinvest into the industry .
Capital
Having the private sector more involved could assist , by giving them incentives to invest .
A suggestion is in revising Capital Gains Tax .
One of the key aspects of the US ecosystem , is for the ability of investors to reinvest capital proceeds from previous investments without consequence .
Removing any CGT on reinvested funds will encourage not just investment from previous successes , but also attract other investors to target their money into this sector .
Government
Ways the government can drive demand , is to follow the US governments lead , and become a major buyer of Australian technology .
By reducing departmental hurdles and giving clear incentive to use Australian technology , this gives young startups enough of a base to expand in the market .
This government investment , on money they already needs to spend - into a fragile ecosystem that 's still growing - could be a great source of investment .
For example , most startup companies fail at securing deals with enterprise customers , because they do n't have the long standing history and guarantee of success ( and therefore continued delivery of service ) .
Ironically , it is often the first few customers that can fund further development to grow a business to one that is sustainable .
If the government is willing to take more risk on its technology investments , it could bootstrap an entire industry .
There also needs to be reform of the tendering system for IT contracts that makes it easier , and encourages small businesses to apply for government work .
The problem now is that the tendering system favors big companies
It was remarked that t he government does not support innovation where it is most likely to occur - in individuals and small organisations .
What needs to happen is the government needs to ' tender ' for good solutions from these groups and award prizes for innovative solutions , as has worked well in the UK and US .
Innovation
There is a split between the Silicon Beach community on what support the government should give over open source technologies .
Some believe the government should bias open source in government infrastructure ; others claim government development in open source projects should be released to the public for the broader open source communities .
It was also said though that it is not the role of the government to be advocating for open source .
Although , opening up data was unanimously supported .
As it is the information revolution , setting free information helps spur that revolution .
One of the key trends identified by the leaders of information technology globally , is on opening up data silos and reusing them in innovative ways .
The government has vast mountains of valuable data that could really spur innovation in this area .
An example where the government prevented innovation in the past was with maps .
For example , Google Maps was invented in Australia , but it was only implemented here a lot later – long after it had become popular overseas .
A lot of other competing companies have struggled to enter the market due to the licensing costs imposed by the government– which are non-existent in overseas markets .
An example of what the government could do , is to follow the leads of the Obama administration in the creation of http://data.gov , and the UK government , who is currently being advised by Sir Tim Berners - Lee ( the inventor of the Web ) on how it can open up its data silos .
Only days ago , San Francisco 's mayor announced the opening up of government data which he expects will allow creative uses of it , to create new innovate information products .
Cloud computing is the long term trend of the technology industry , and with infrastructure " in the cloud " , the underlying software no longer matters ( and why some argue , supporting open source is irrelevant ) .
What matters now is the data - and easy access to data that allows privacy - respecting interoperability is key .
Practical steps that the government can do to pursue this is by supporting open standards - technical specifications that the market can adopt in the same way consistent railroad guages leads to a stronger national rail network - that allows government data to be reused with ease .
Other suggestions
A final comment which was communicated strongly was that there needs to be a
dedicated government focus
.
Follow the US in appointing a Chief Technical Officer to drive technology strategy in the country .
Better trend tracking .
That includes the identification on new ICT industries , specifically Internet based industries that can provide future job opportunities , wealth and growth both directly within the sector , and in support industries .
Having identified these opportunities , the Government needs to do more broadly to encourage local startups .
( An example would be recognisng the upcoming data web , where the releasing government data for public resuse could spur innovation in this upcoming trend .
A formalized way for the government to talk directly with small business and start - ups , to understand their needs and how government can help them .
Government resources seem to bias non-information economy industries in terms of funding , treaty negotiations , government expertise .
That needs to change .
Many other ideas were submitted by the community , but have been excluded for editorial reasons .
We hope however that this document spurs discussion and is the start of better dialogue between the government and this dynamic growth sector of the economy .
This paper had over 60 submissions driven mostly by 30 core people , was co-edited by dozens others , and had numerous other people giving advice on the development of this paper .

Update 7/2/2009 : I incorrectly credited Jeffrey Zeldman as the creator of HTML5 Doctor .
Instead , the actual creators of the HTML5 Doctor website are Bruce Lawson , Rich Clark , Jack Osborne , Mike Robinson , Remy Sharp , and Tom Leadbetter as described at http://html5doctor.com/about/.
This change has been made below .
It 's an exciting time to be a web developer .
The browser wars are in full swing , reminiscent of the mid-90s .
Firefox 3.5 was released only yesterday with plenty of cool , new features including HTML5 support for audio , video , offline and local storage , and canvas text .
Google 's Chrome and Apple 's Safari are blazing fast , already sporting cutting edge HTML5 features .
The HTML5 draft specification , although years from completion , is already influencing web browser development and will revolutionize the way we develop for the World Wide Web .
The future is here !
But should we be excited yet ?
Microsoft 's Internet Explorer still boasts a 65 % majority share of the web browser market as of May 2009 , according to Net Applications Market Share1 .
Older versions of Internet Explorer are still very much in use : version 7 with 41 % , version 6 with 17 % , and version 8 with 7 % .
Only in Internet Explorer 8 did Microsoft provide near - complete CSS 2.1 support .
But Internet Explorer 8 still falls far short of its competitors in terms of features and speed .
Yes , Internet Explorer 8 makes our web development lives easier assuming we are content with CSS 2.1 , and assuming Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 users choose to upgrade to Internet Explorer 8 .
But what about HTML5 ?
What about CSS3 ?
Forget about XHTML : it is a lost cause that can be directly credited to lack of development and Microsoft 's refusal to support the standard in its Internet Explorer web browser .
Even Dave Shea from Mezzoblue says HTML5 - ready HTML 4.01 is the way forward2 .
Unfortunately , I fear the future of the World Wide Web is at Microsoft 's discretion .
What Do We Do ?
This is not a rhetorical question .
I want to know what you think .
Some suggest web developers begin charging for Internet Explorer 6 support .
Andy Clarke proposes a bare - bones IE6 - only style sheet that provides adequate support for the aging browser3 .
Others express a more blunt technique best described by John Gruber of Daring Fireball :
Firefox 3.5 is out , and , among a slew of major improvements , it now supports the HTML 5 < audio > and < video > tags .
I do n't post many video clips to Daring Fireball , but henceforth , when I do , it 'll be with the < video > tag .
IE users can suck it .
John Gruber - http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/06/30/ff5
Still , my question remains unanswered : when should we get excited about HTML5 and CSS3 ?
When will it be truly realistic to develop cross - browser compatible websites using these modern technologies ?
Even Microsoft has released online advertisements4 encouraging users to upgrade from " browsers several generations old " ...
Microsoft , er , might you be referring to your Internet Explorer 6 web browser ?
Here is the Microsoft advertisement called " GRIPES " featuring Dean Cain of Lois and Clark fame .
This humorous and well - intended video is proof that even Microsoft wants users to ditch its Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 products in favor of its much - improved Internet Explorer 8 web browser .
Start Now !
We must usher in the future of web development .
If your business model permits , drop support for Internet Explorer 6 .
Start learning HTML5 .
Jeffrey Zeldman Bruce Lawson , Rich Clark , Jack Osborne , Mike Robinson , Remy Sharp , and Tom Leadbetter have launched HTML5 Doctor , a website dedicated to teaching HTML55 .
O'Reilly says Google is backing HTML56 .
And Chris Wilson , platform architect of the Internet Explorer platform , says that Internet Explorer 8 will steadily increase its support for HTML5 ; Internet Explorer 8 already supports a few HTML5 features such as cross - document messaging , the window location hash , and network connection awareness7 .
As I see it , the problem we developers face is IE - users ' slow adoption of Internet Explorer 8 .
As much as I dislike Internet Explorer , it is imperative that we encourage , coerce , or even force Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 users to upgrade to Internet Explorer 8 .
Only then can we really get excited about the future of the World Wide Web .

The Obama administration Monday set the country on a course to confront whether actions taken in the name of defending Americans instead crossed criminal lines .
In simultaneous moves , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. opened an investigation into whether CIA interrogators broke the law and the administration complied with a judge ’s order and released a long - secret CIA report that cataloged allegations of agency prisoner abuse .
The administration also released memos sought in recent months by former Vice President Dick Cheney that he argued attest to the success of the CIA ’s controversial methods , but that appeared inconclusive in part because the agency had blacked out large portions of the memos .
The release of the report by the CIA ’s inspector general provided the most comprehensive account to date of the interrogation program , with previously undisclosed details such as prisoners being choked to the point of passing out or threatened with harm to their families .

The administration sought to limit the impact of Monday ’s moves , which it appeared to make with some reluctance .
Holder described the inquiry as “ preliminary , ” and the White House left many pages of the CIA report blacked out .
But fallout from the decisions could prove difficult to contain .
The investigation is likely to intensify an already bitter battle in Washington over whether to punish career intelligence officials for how they executed the Bush administration ’s counter - terrorism campaign .
The investigation means that CIA counter - terrorism officials could face criminal scrutiny for years at a time when the agency and the Justice Department are supposed to be part of a seamless counter - terrorism team and contributing to a new elite interrogation outfit , which was also unveiled Monday .

CIA Director Leon E. Panetta , who had fought both the criminal investigation and the release of the inspector general ’s report , issued a statement to agency employees Monday describing the details of the document as “ an old story . ”
“ For the CIA now , the challenge is not the battles of yesterday , but those of today and tomorrow , ” Panetta said .
In announcing the inquiry , Holder concluded that there was enough evidence to warrant a fresh examination of whether federal law had been violated .
He said he realized the decision “ will be controversial , ” but added : “ It is clear to me that this review is the only responsible course of action for me to take . ”
To lead the review , Holder tapped Assistant U.S. Atty .
John H. Durham of Connecticut , who in 2008 was appointed by the Bush administration to investigate the destruction of CIA videotapes of detainee interrogations .

Durham already has assembled a team of investigators who will determine whether the preliminary review turns up enough evidence to warrant a criminal investigation .
Holder ’s decision to open the investigation was driven to a large degree by his reaction to reading the CIA inspector general report earlier this year .
The report was issued in 2004 .
Officials within the Justice Department at the time reviewed the document and opted to keep it secret .
The report became available to the public , at least in part , for the first time Monday as the result of an ACLU lawsuit .
The document includes new disclosures on how top Al Qaeda prisoners were told that their families faced harm if they did n’t cooperate .
“ We could get your mother in here , ” a CIA interrogator told Abd al Rahim al Nashiri , the man suspected of plotting the 2000 bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole , according to the report .
The threat was meant to prey on fears in the Middle East that prisoners are made to witness the sexual abuse of their relatives .

Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the self - proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks , was told , “ If anything else happens in the United States , ‘ We ’re going to kill your children , ’ ” according to the report .
In some cases , the report praises how the CIA prisons were run , and acknowledges that the program provided valuable intelligence .
During a 19 - month stretch after the Sept. 11 attacks , the report said , the interrogation program accounted for 3,000 intelligence reports , providing the agency with much of its understanding of Al Qaeda .
Interrogations “ provided intelligence that has enabled the identification and apprehension of other terrorists and warned of terrorist plots , ” the report said .
Even so , the report concluded that the effectiveness of particular techniques “ cannot be so easily measured , ” raising the question of whether the enhanced methods had been crucial to collecting that data .
But the report also faults CIA personnel across agency ranks for failures in oversight and abuses in the interrogation booth .
In one passage , the document warns that the agency ’s activities “ are inconsistent with the public policy positions that the United States has taken regarding human rights . ”
The document also cites the anxieties of CIA case officers fearful they would one day be held to account .

“ One officer expressed concern that one day , agency officers will wind up on some ‘ wanted list ’ to appear before the World Court , ” the report said .
The report describes cases in which the CIA turned to off - the - books methods , including mock execution and threatening a prisoner with a gun and a power drill .
One previously undisclosed method was known as “ pressure points , ” and involved applying pressure to a prisoner ’s carotid artery “ to the point that the detainee would nod and start to pass out ” before being shaken awake .
Many of the incidents described in the document have been previously disclosed .
The report expresses deep misgivings , for example , about the simulated drowning method known as waterboarding .

Two prisoners were subjected repeatedly to that method , despite deep concern among the agency ’s own medical staff , as well as explicit language in Justice Department memos warning against such repetition .
The method appears to be the subject of a 23 - page section of the report that was nearly completely blacked out .
But even in laying out potential violations of U.S. anti-torture laws , the document contains details that underscore how difficult it could be to obtain convictions .
The excessive use of waterboarding , for example , appears to have been sanctioned by then - Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft , who “ confirmed that DOJ approved of the expanded use of various ” techniques .
There are new indications that CIA higher - ups sometimes pushed for the use of brutal tactics even after interrogators believed a prisoner was cooperating .

The opinions of CIA officials at headquarters “ are not always supported by an objective evaluation , ” and were often based on inflated “ presumptions of what the individual might or should know , ” according to the report .
The report was produced by former CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson , who issued a statement Monday saying he was “ disappointed ” that the government did not declassify large segments of the document , including the recommendations he issued to address problems the report identified .
President Obama outlawed the CIA ’s use of so - called enhanced interrogation techniques in January and ordered the secret prisons closed .
But he has come under criticism for dismantling programs that Republicans , led by Cheney , argue were crucial to keeping the country safe .
Advertisement
In recent months , the former vice president has pushed for the declassification of two documents he said would bolster his argument .
After the administration released them , Cheney issued a statement to the Weekly Standard saying the documents show he was right .
The documents “ clearly demonstrate that the individuals subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided the bulk of intelligence we gained about Al Qaeda , ” he said Monday night .
“ This intelligence saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks . ”
However , the documents provide few details on what role , if any , enhanced interrogation methods played in getting terrorists to talk .
One is titled “ Detainee Reporting Pivotal for the War Against Al Qaeda . ”
But it indicates that officials believe some top Al Qaeda leaders talked simply because they believed the CIA already had the information from other detainees .
Advertisement
The other document focuses on Mohammed , who gave up crucial information about Al Qaeda ’s weapons of mass destruction program because “ he apparently calculated -- incorrectly -- that we had this information already . ”

Geothermal Could be Cheaper than Fossil Fuels with $ 3 Billion DOE Investment Says NYU Study
July 18th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
[ social_buttons ]
It looks as if Geothermal power could be the genie let out of the bottle to provide us with almost staggering amounts of electricity at just 0.04 cents per kwh .
Geothermal could be cheaper than fossil fuels , according to a study just published at NYU Stern .
Yet , strangely , geothermal received the fewest Federal DOE dollars invested in R&D over the last 8 years .
Hm .
I wonder why that was ?
The first study to compare efficiency improvement of various renewable energy alternatives in response to government funding found that geothermal has yielded the highest returns per R&D dollars invested by the Department of Energy .
NYU Stern Professor Melissa Schilling ; an expert in strategic management and technology and innovation management found that of all renewable energy technologies the performance of geothermal improves the most per dollar of R&D invested .
Wind power was the next , and solar power received the most Federal R&D funding .
But they have all lagged fossil fuel funding .
The United States still invests more government dollars yearly on R&D for fossil fuel technologies than for all of the renewable energies combined .
By contrast , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom spend more R&D on renewable energies than fossil fuel technologies , the study found .
Despite getting the most funding in the US , fossil fuel technologies are no longer improving efficiency much or at all .
Below the fold : one geothermal breakthrough birthed by $ 1 Million in US DOE R&D funding :
One example of a DOE funded geothermal energy research breakthrough is the creation of a new method of capturing significantly more heat from low - temperature geothermal resources , developed by scientists at the US Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , using $ 1.2 million as one of 21 DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy grants through the Geothermal Technologies Program .
PNNL ’s conversion system exploits the rapid expansion and contraction capabilities of a new biphasic fluid .
When exposed to heat brought to the surface from water circulating in moderately hot , underground rock , the thermal - cycling of the biphasic fluid will power a turbine to generate electricity .
To aid in efficiency , scientists added nanostructured metal - organic heat carriers , or MOHCs , which boost the power generation capacity to near that of a conventional steam cycle .
The goal of the project is to enable power generation from low - temperature geothermal resources at an economical cost .
The research team is targeting the development of a functioning bench - top prototype generating electricity by the end of the year , according to PNNL Laboratory Fellow Pete McGrail , who says :
“ Some novel research on nanomaterials used to capture carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels actually led us to this discovery .
Scientific breakthroughs can come from some very unintuitive connections . ”
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/ierTocw1BG8&hl=en&fs=1&]
So that ’s what we got for a mere $ 1.2 Million in government funding .
For a one - time investment in R&D by the DOE of $ 3 Billion , we could have an alternative to fossil fuel , that is cheaper than fossil fuels .
To put that government funding in perspective , we have spent $ 12 Billion a month , every month in Iraq for 8 years , attempting to preserve our access to just one fossil fuel .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
The Philadelphia Daily News is reporting that the Portland Trail Blazers and point guard Andre Miller have a deal in place .
A deal which should be finalized within the next 24 hours .
ESPN.com is reporting that the deal is worth $ 21 million over three seasons , which completely dwarfs any other deal he ’s been offered .
Miller ’s former team the Sixers were rumored to be offering $ 6 million but for only one season .
The New York Knicks , another team interested in his services , were also interested in just a one year deal .
So the Blazers talked with money and length , giving Miller no choice but to take the deal .
ESPN.com says the first two years of the deal are guaranteed , with an option for a third year .
Miller is a clear winner in this as the Blazers went well above what he should of received .
There are a few other winners in this deal thou , as well as a couple losers .
Lets look at that aspect of this deal .
WINNER – Portland Trail Blazers
The Blazers have been looking to bring in some veteran experience all summer , especially at the point , and have been getting turned down left and right .
They had the well publicized diss from Hedo Turkoglu .
The Utah Jazz matched the teams offer to Paul Millsap .
All while losing out in the Jason Kidd swepstakes .
Bringing Miller in gives them a much needed veteran point guard .
He can provide a solid 35 + minutes a game and be a leader to the young kids on that team .
With his size he gives the team another weapon on offense as he excels in the post - up , back your opponent down type of game that most point guards do n’t .
“ He ’s got great savvy and leadership , ” GM Kevin Pritchard said .
“ We like him as a player for sure . ”
LOSER – Steve Blake
A big loser in this is last years starting point guard , Steve Blake .
Blake ’s minutes are going to take a huge cut next season .
As a starter he only averaged in the lower end of 30 minutes per game , look for that to drop to upper teens , low twenties next season .
Miller is the clear cut starter and its at the sacrifice of Blake .
Surprisingly Blake is bigger then Miller height wise but does n’t play it .
He ’s more of an outside guy , while Miller likes to mix it up all over the court .
Blake should still see plenty of action due to his ability to knock down the three , one area where Miller is not good at , at all .
But even with that , Blake ’s stock takes a huge hit .
What makes it worse ?
He ’ll be in the final season of his contact as a backup .
Not good for a guy who would like to strike it big in free agency next summer .
WINNER – Lou Williams
Lou has been a career backup in Philadelphia , never starting once during his 252 game tenure .
He gets his chance now , a chance he ’s been waiting for .
He let the public know it was a long time coming too .
“ It ’s something I felt like I ’ve been prepared for for a long time , ” Williams told Comcast SportsNet .
“ Hopefully , the opportunity remains and I ’ll take full advantage of it . ”
Well Lou , the opportunity is here and it ’s your time to shine .
With Coach Eddie Jordan ’s Princeton offense , Williams will be put in a position to succeed .
As long as the team does n’t go sign a veteran to back him up , he ’ll get more then enough chances to prove he belongs in the starting lineup .
His game differs a lot from Miller , which is n’t a bad thing either .
“ I ’m not going to be perfect , ” Williams said .
“ One thing I would ask people – just do n’t expect Andre Miller out of me .
I ’m not that type of player .
I use my scoring ability to create opportunities for other guys ; he used his passing ability to create opportunities for other guys .
Hopefully , people will stay open - minded . ”
So get ready Sixer fans he ’s definitely a change of pace , a scoring point guard .
UNCERTAIN – Philadelphia 76ers
I ’m not sure whether or not to call this a win or loss for the Sixers .
It literally could go either way .
The team could either take off with Williams at the helm , or fall apart at the seams .
We wo n’t have an idea till the season is a few weeks old .
The team does have a glaring need for an experienced guard now thou .
Currently their only point guards are Williams and rookie Jrue Holiday .
There was a rumor out there yesterday talking about Jamaal Tinsley who was just released by the Indiana Pacers and another about C.J. Watson .
Both are possibilities but will either sign for just one season .
But yea , the Sixers stay undecided till the NBA season starts .
Here ’s a link to other blogs about Andre Miller joining the Blazers .
Blaze of Love – Blazers Offer Andre Miller 3 Year $ 21 Million Deal
Rip City Project – Report : Blazers to sign Andre Miller
BAGHDAD
OUR dinner  a six - plus - pound common carp  came out of a murky pool and landed with a wet slap on a bare concrete floor , exposed to the dusty night air except for a crude awning of corrugated metal .
The sous chef , if you will , lifted a wooden club and delivered a crushing blow to the head that clearly came nowhere near killing the creature , since it continued to writhe as the knife was plunged through its gills and then along its spine , not through the gut , the only way I ’ve ever known to clean a fish .
Iraqis are particular about selecting their fish  preferring males over females , for example  and then seeing it to its mortal end for a simple reason : it should be as fresh as possible and , even while still twitching , roasted over an open fire in the style called masquf , which has been associated with Baghdad for centuries at least .
“ They want it exactly in the traditional way , ” said Munir Khadim , the owner of Al - Baghdadi , a restaurant on a stretch of the Tigris River in Baghdad where fish have probably been roasted in more or less the same way since the earliest days of civilization .
“ It ’s part of Iraqi folklore . ”
Conservationists in Bangladesh are celebrating after remote tribespeople discovered a rare and threatened leopard that was believed to have been extinct in the country for almost 20 years .
Villagers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in south - east Bangladesh captured the clouded leopard cub after they disturbed it , its sibling and their mother eating a dead monkey in the jungle .
The others escaped , but the villagers captured the three - month - old and put it in a cage .
It is understood the tribespeople planned to sell the animal but , after news of the discovery spread , conservationists persuaded them to release the leopard back into the wild .
They did so yesterday .
" We are delighted .
For many years now , we had thought this animal was gone or was going , " said Professor Anwarul Islam , head of the Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh .
" It 's good to know that they are still there and that they are breeding . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The clouded leopard , which famously has large dark patterns on its coat , is considered vulnerable across all of south - east Asia , with loss of habitat through deforestation and the Chinese trade in rare animal parts being blamed for the decline .
Listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , there are an estimated 100,000 living worldwide .
Reports suggest that the last sighting of the shy and nocturnal animal in Bangladesh was in 1992 .
Mr Islam said the villagers in an area of south - east Bangladesh bordering Burma and the north - east Indian state of Mizoram , had stumbled on the family of animals three weeks ago .
They took the cub to their village , where it was fed on chicken and milk .
The villagers were anxious about releasing the animal as they feared it would struggle to survive in the wild without its mother .
But Mr Islam said the fact that the leopard had a healthy appetite was a good sign .
" Most wild animals do not like to eat in captivity but this cub was eating chickens , " he said .
" The villagers also tried to feed it milk but apparently he preferred the meat . "
Environmentalists have long been on the losing side of a battle in Bangladesh , a desperately poor country where conservation has seldom seemed a priority .
In recent years , however , awareness has grown and organisations such as the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association ( Bela ) have campaigned for the enforcement of orders by the country 's courts on issues such as forest protection .
Clouded leopards are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity .
There is a breeding programme under way involving zoos in Thailand and the US , and three baby leopards were recently born at the Nashville Zoo .
Christine Breitenmoser - Würsten , a Swiss specialist on large cats who works with the World Conservation Union , said the threat to the clouded leopard varied from location to location .
In Burma and southern China local people still hunted the cats for food while elsewhere , pelt - hunters and destruction of habitat represented the biggest danger .
Of the discovery of the cub in Bangladesh , she said : " It 's very exciting – it 's fascinating .
I was thrilled when I heard about it . "
This Sunday ’s New York Times ’ Magazine had a special and resonant theme : “ Saving the World ’s Women . ”
The magazine had a descriptive collection of articles well - worth reading .
They covered subjects including the challenge of educating young girls in Afghanistan , an interview with Hillary Clinton covering the Obama Administration ’s foreign policy in relation to women ’s rights , a troubling trend of gender selection in developing countries , and a growing branch of philanthropy in which women support women ’s causes .
The cover article , “ The Women ’s Crusade , ” is an excerpt from Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn ’s upcoming book “ Half the Sky : Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide . ”
I ’ll highlight a few of the most important problems and solutions illustrated in the issue here , but the whole magazine is well worth reading , and much of it focuses on South Asia and issues relevant to South Asia .
The cover article speaks urgently about the world ’s “ missing women ” :
Amartya Sen , the ebullient Nobel Prize - winning economist , developed a gauge of gender inequality that is striking …â € œMore than 100 million women are missing , â€ 
Sen wrote in 1990 … Sen noted that in normal circumstances , women live longer than men , and so there are more females than males in much of the world .
Yet in places where girls have a deeply unequal status , they vanish .
China has 107 males for every 100 females in its overall population ( and an even greater disproportion among newborns ) , and India has 108 .
The implication of the sex ratios , Sen later found , is that about 107 million females are missing from the globe today .
Tragically , another article , “ the daughter deficit , ” points out that as development progresses in China and India , sexual selection actually becomes even worse .
As women become better educated , they have less children , and the implied urgency of having a boy ironically increases than if they had many children :
In Punjab , then Indiaâ€™s richest state , which had a high rate of female literacy and a high average age of marriage … the prejudice for sons flourished .
Along with Haryana , Punjab had the countryâ€™s highest percentage of so - called missing girls â€ ” those aborted , killed as newborns or dead in their first few years from neglect .
Here was a puzzle : Development seemed to have not only failed to help many Indian girls but to have made things worse .
There are many more striking facts about the oppression of women globally : 1 % of the world ’s landowners are women , a woman in India has a 1 - in - 70 chance of dying in childbirth , girls in India 1 - 5 years of age are 50 % more likely to die than boys their age , 1 million children work in Asia ’s sex trade , “ bride burnings ” take place in India every two hours , and much more harrowing information that is important to read .
But for all the bad news , there is also a lot of inspiring news in the magazine .
It illustrates that simple steps taken to help educate and empower the world ’s women can have a dramatic effect on the problems of poverty and extremism .
( The good news after the jump … . )
The description of Saima Muhammad ’s story is particularly powerful .
A woman in Lahore , Pakistan , Saima used to be beaten by her unemployed , deadbeat husband every afternoon , and her husband ’s family ’s mistreatment of her wrecked her spirit .
Yet when she thought she had hit an emotional low , she signed up for a microloan from Kashf Foundation , and using the initial $ 65 seed , created a thriving embroidery small business that allowed her to “ pay off her husband ’s entire debt , keep her daughters in school , renovate the house , connect running water and buy a television . ”
She is making sure all her three daughters get an education , and her husband now “ accepts orders ” from her .
The notable part of this story is not only the effect microfinance had on Saima , but also the effect that the microloan will have on future generations .
She will now be able to educate her children , which will hopefully allow them to all become productive , self - sustaining , politically moderate members of Pakistani society and in turn empower more productive , self - sustaining , politically moderate members of Pakistani society .
Microfinance is just one of the tools that effectively empowers women in some of the world ’s most oppressive countries ; thing as simple as providing free textbooks , uniforms for school , improving maternity care , and eliminating iodine deficiencies can also do wonders to improve gender equality , and thus , improve life in the country as a whole .
The many writers in the magazine make a convincing case that empowering women is absolutely necessary for a prosperous and peaceful world .
There are a variety of suggestions for ways in which you ( yes you , personally ! ) can help empower women in developing countries :
It suggests giving a microloan on Kiva , sponsoring a girl through Plan USA or Women for Women International , advocate at CARE , or finding your own cause that excites you .
The magazine left me sure that simple steps to empower women really can change our world .

Hubble takes unplanned glance at Jupiter
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : July 24 , 2009
Taking a break from extensive testing following May 's shuttle repair mission , the Hubble Space Telescope was expected to point toward Jupiter Thursday to take pictures of a dark impact scar that first appeared on the giant planet last weekend .

Engineers programmed Hubble to spend a few hours observing Jupiter Thursday afternoon .
Imagery of Jupiter could be released by late Friday , according to Ray Villard , spokesperson for the Space Telescope Science Institute .
" This impact is regarded as a target of opportunity , " Villard said .
" You drop everything and go look at it . "
Scientists plan procedures for such quickie observations , but Hubble has never been ordered to look at a target of opportunity so soon after a servicing mission .
Villard said Hubble 's Wide Field Camera 3 , a powerful new instrument just installed by the Atlantis crew , would be used to take pictures of Jupiter in ultraviolet and visible wavelengths .
Jupiter 's scar was first observed Sunday by an Australian amateur astronomer .
Ground - based observatories immediately turned toward Jupiter , confirming a blemish the size of the Pacific Ocean in the planet 's southern hemisphere .
Infrared images of Jupiter show the impact site is bright due to reflective aerosol particles thrown high into the atmosphere .
Visible light pictures show a darker bruise - like feature .
This image shows a large impact shown on the bottom left on Jupiter 's south polar region captured on July 20 , 2009 , by NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility in Mauna Kea , Hawaii .

The asteroid or comet responsible for the this week 's scar hit Jupiter on the 15th anniversary of the Shoemaker - Levy 9 impact events in 1994 .
More than 20 fragments struck Jupiter over a six - day period in July 1994 after the gas giant 's gravity tore the comet apart two years earlier .
This week 's event is only the second time astronomers have studied an impact on Jupiter .
Hubble was in the midst of a nearly four - month Servicing Mission Observatory Verification period , a series of tests and calibrations designed to check new equipment astronauts installed during May 's upgrades .
" There are certain kinds of images you can only get from Hubble , in terms of sharpness , quality ( and ) detail , " Villard said .
Astronomers could not wait long to schedule observing time on Hubble .
The smudge is expected to fade over the coming weeks and months .
" Because it is transient , we have to do it now , " Villard said .
British airlines on Sunday stepped up restrictions on suspected swine flu carriers , as a report said four more British students quarantined in China have had infections confirmed .
Britain is Europe 's worst - hit territory , with estimates of 55,000 new cases last week , and both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic said they have put in place measures to turn back passengers showing symptoms .
" If we have concerns about a customer or the customer is concerned , then we have a 24 - hour medical service we can call to give advice to staff , " said a British Airways spokeswoman .
" There have been a number of cases where we have advised customers not to fly on the basis of their diagnosis or symptoms of H1N1 . "
Britain's health authorities are advising people with symptoms to delay journeys if they are feeling unwell .
" If there are signs of something being wrong , be it excessive sneezing or coughing , not looking well , high temperature , then the airport staff can call in a medical team for extra advice , " added Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles .
" If the medical team believe there are reasons not to fly , the passenger will be asked to produce a fit to fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital , and they will be put at our cost on to the next available flight . "
The news of more stringent checks came with a group of 52 students and teachers in quarantine after the British Council said four students tested positive for the A( H1N1 ) virus upon their arrival in Beijing for a study tour .
Later Sunday , the BBC said on its website that another four British school pupils from the same group had been confirmed as having swine flu following tests .
" It was a bit of surprise to be detained at the airport .
We have been in a state of shock , " Ian Tyrrell , one of the teachers leading the tour , told AFP by telephone from the hotel where the group was quarantined .
Tyrrell said there were some Americans and other nationalities under quarantine at the hotel , some of them students , but he could not provide a specific number .
He added that two of the children who tested positive for swine flu had since rejoined their groups in quarantine , while two others were " doing well " in a Beijing hospital .
China , which has registered around 1,500 positive cases of the virus , has launched aggressive measures to try and detect swine flu , including temperature checks on foreign flights into the country .
While the World Health Organisation has stopped collating figures on infected numbers , European Union Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou predicted Saturday that 60 million people across the 27 - nation bloc would need priority vaccination .
Northern France , next to the Channel crossings into England , has seen an upsurge in new cases over the past week -- and Italy has warned that the start of the next school year could also be put back .
The spread of swine flu shows no sign of abating , with Egypt reporting its first death linked to the virus on Sunday after a 25 - year - old woman returning from Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia died in hospital .
Egypt 's top cleric or mufti , Sheikh Ali Gomaa , said he would not issue a decree barring Egyptians from making the pilgrimage , but health officials said all returning pilgrims would be quarantined .
New cases were also confirmed Sunday by Moroccan health authorities and in Russia , where a sailor back in port became the ninth person infected since the end of May .
In the last table released by the WHO on July 6 , the UN agency had recorded 94,512 laboratory - confirmed cases in 136 countries and territories since April , including 429 deaths .

' Mumbai plane passengers were treated inhumanely '
August 25 , 2006 16:49 IST
" The way they got arrested inside the plane with everybody seeing how they got treated , I thought it was inhumane ... they were treated like dogs , " said Antunius Slotboom , who was on Northwest flight No 42 with 149 passengers that was escorted back to Schipol airport by F - 16 fighters on Wednesday .
The behaviour of the men , all residents of Mumbai , shortly after the plane took off from Amsterdam had triggered the security alert .
They did not put on their seat belts , changed seats and exchanged their mobile phones , arousing the suspicion of the crew and air marshals .
Slotboom , who arrived in Mumbai on Thursday night along with 17 other Mumbai - bound passengers of the Northwest flight , however , said their arrest seemed part of an " offensive against Arabic people " .
" They did not hit them ( arrested men ) but they pushed them .
They let them feel that they have no power , that the people who arrested them had all the power , " he said .
Slotboom said he too was kicked off the plane after he remarked that the arrests were akin to what the Germans had done under Hitler during World War II .
" They came to me and said , " You come with us and you are not allowed to fly any more , " he said .
Nitin Dalal , another passenger , said the arrested men " were not listening to the crew " and did things that made the crew " suspicious . "
Another passenger Bharat Menon told PTI , " The cabin crew was repeatedly asking the passengers to fasten their seat belts when one of the passengers received a call on his cell phone .
The person , who was travelling in Economy Class along with his friends then spoke bit excitedly over the phone ....
The behaviour of these men was suspicious and they were handing the cell phones to each other . "
The men were released after Dutch authorities found no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities .
