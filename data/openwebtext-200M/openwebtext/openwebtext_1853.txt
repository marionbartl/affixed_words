Scientists found a component called epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) prevents HIV from binding to immune system cells by getting there first .
Once EGCG has bound to immune system cells there is no room for HIV to take hold in its usual fashion .
However , experts said the joint UK and US work , which appears in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , was at a very preliminary stage .
We suggest that it should be used in combination with conventional medicines to improve quality of life for those infected

University of Sheffield
Researcher Professor Mike Williamson , of the University of Sheffield , said : " Our research shows that drinking green tea could reduce the risk of becoming infected by HIV , and could also slow down the spread of HIV .
" It is not a cure , and nor is it a safe way to avoid infection , however , we suggest that it should be used in combination with conventional medicines to improve quality of life for those infected .
" Future research is also currently under way in order to determine how much effect can be expected from different amounts of tea . "
More work needed
Keith Alcorn , senior editor of the Aidsmap web service , said tests on animals would be needed before any conclusions could be safely drawn on the potential protective effect of drinking green tea .
" This study only looks at the ability of a chemical in green tea to block HIV binding to human CD4 immune cells in the test tube .
" Many substances shown to prevent HIV infection in the test tube turn out to have little or no effect in real life , so I think there 's a long way to go before anyone should rely on green tea to protect against HIV infection . "
Lisa Power , head of policy at the HIV charity , Terrence Higgins Trust said : " Condoms keep HIV at bay .
Anything that boosts your immune system is beneficial for people with HIV , but green tea can't be a substitute for proper medication and prevention techniques . "
Green tea has been linked to a positive effect on a wide range of conditions , including heart disease , cancer and Alzheimer's .
WASHINGTON --
Some lending companies with access to a national database that contains confidential information on 60 million student borrowers have repeatedly searched it in ways that violate federal rules , raising alarms about abuse of privacy , government and university officials said .
The unauthorized searching has grown so pervasive that the Education Department is considering a temporary shutdown of the government - run database to review access policies and tighten security .
Some officials worry that businesses are trolling for marketing data they can use to bombard students with mass mailings or other solicitations .
Students ' Social Security numbers , e-mail addresses , phone numbers , birth dates , and sensitive financial information such as loan balances are in the database , which is covered by federal privacy laws .
" We are just in shock that student data could be compromised like this , " said Nancy Hoover , director of financial aid at Denison University in Ohio .
Education Department spokeswoman Katherine McLane said the agency has spent more than $ 650,000 since 2003 to safeguard the database .
The department has blocked thousands of users it deemed unqualified for access after security reviews , McLane said , and it has blocked 246 users from the student loan industry .
In general , the department allows lenders to search records in the database only if they have a student 's permission or a financial relationship with the student .
The department has been " vigilant in its monitoring for unauthorized uses " of the database , McLane said .
Concerns about possible abuses of the database are emerging as the student loan industry is under investigation by congressional Democrats and the New York attorney general .
Critics say the $ 85 billion - a- year industry has cozied up to government and university officials who are in the position to help lenders .
The National Student Loan Data System was created in 1993 to help determine whether students are eligible for financial aid and assist in collecting loan payments .
About 29,000 university financial aid administrators and 7,500 loan company employees have access to it .
In a recent meeting with university financial aid directors , Theresa Shaw , chief operating officer of the department 's Office of Federal Student Aid , which manages the database , said lenders have been mining it for student data with increasing frequency , according to three participants at the meeting .
" She said the data mining had gotten out of control , and they were trying to tone it down , " said Eileen O'Leary , director of student aid and finance at Stonehill College of Easton , Mass . , who was at the Feb. 26 session .
" They 'd seen the mining for a few years , but now they felt it had grown exponentially . "
The department first noticed a problem in 2003 when loan consolidation became more popular , according to an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter .
As companies began to aggressively look for low - risk borrowers to target for consolidation plans , they turned to the database for prospective customers , the official said .
Users on the system can view only one student record at a time , and the department can monitor each time a user views an entry .
" When we see them go in and out very quickly , that 's when it raises flags " about data mining , the official said .
Such abuse would be a violation of department rules .
Officials grew so concerned that in April 2005 , the department sent a letter to database users warning that inappropriate use of the system -- in other words , looking for information without authorization -- could cause their access to be revoked .
The letter said the agency was " specifically troubled " that lenders were giving unauthorized users -- such as marketing firms , collection agencies , and loan brokerage firms -- the ability to access the database .
Through a spokeswoman , Shaw declined to comment .
After the warnings , inappropriate usage of the system seemed to decline .
But several months ago , top managers learned the practice had resumed .
Senior education officials are advocating a temporary shutdown of access to the database until tighter security measures can be put in place .
Some financial aid directors say abuse of the database would explain why some students who have taken out loans only directly with the government are deluged by up to a half - dozen solicitations a day from private loan companies .
" Our students are being inundated with marketing from consolidation companies , " O'Leary said .
" How else are the consolidation companies getting our students ' information ? "

Israel and the US have agreed to refuse recognition to a new Palestinian coalition government ahead of talks in Jerusalem today , the Israeli prime minister said yesterday , reducing the already slim prospects of progress in the peace process .
Ehud Olmert , who is due to meet Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , at a meeting chaired by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , in a Jerusalem hotel this morning , said that he and the US had agreed to shun the new Palestinian unity government .
When the talks were first announced a month ago they were hailed as the biggest effort in six years to restart peace negotiations , and came alongside new meetings of the Quartet of Middle East negotiators : the US , the UN , the EU and Russia .
One UN diplomat at the time described the effort as a " launching pad for the new peace process " , and Ms Rice spoke of " trying to accelerate progress on the road map " .
But there is now little expectation that the talks will produce any new deals .
Mr Olmert , who spoke by phone to George Bush on Friday , said that the US and Israel had agreed that the new Palestinian government , to be formed following a rare agreement between rival factions earlier this month , would not be recognised because it still failed to meet the Quartet 's conditions : that it recognise Israel , renounce violence and accept previous peace agreements .
" A Palestinian government that wo n't accept the Quartet conditions wo n't receive recognition and cooperation , " Mr Olmert said yesterday .
" The American and Israeli positions are totally identical on this issue . "
Washington had said it would wait to decide on the new government until after it had been formed , which could take another five weeks , and until its programme had become clear .
The Palestinians had hoped that today 's meeting would set out more clearly the details of a future Palestinian state , including issues such as borders and the fate of Palestinian refugees .
They argued that a clearer definition of what a future settlement would look like might speed up the peace process .
Yesterday Ms Rice met Mr Abbas and Mr Olmert separately ahead of today 's talks .
" I hope that this meeting of the three of us will be an opportunity to examine the current situation , to commit - recommit - to existing agreements but also to begin to explore and probe the political and diplomatic horizon , " she said .
Although the agreement for a new coalition Palestinian government does not meet the Quartet 's conditions , it has brought a halt to the factional fighting between Hamas and Fatah that had claimed more than 100 lives and threatened a slide into civil war .
The Palestinians argue that Mr Abbas would risk restarting the violence if he pulled out of the agreement now and note that he heads the Palestine Liberation Organisation , which has already recognised Israel .
But Israel says that Mr Abbas should distance himself from the radical elements of Hamas .
There is pressure from some quarters in Israel for the government to make a move .
" Placing the blame for stalling on the other side , in this case on Hamas , will not prevent terror attacks and holds no hope for the future , " an editorial in the left - leaning Ha'aretz said yesterday .
" It is the responsibility of Israel 's leadership to prepare itself and the nation that elected it for a daring and far - reaching political plan , even if the conditions for its implementation have not yet been created . "
Research labs are an old idea .
Edison âs Menlo park lab in the 1870s had most of the elements innovation labs and R&D groups try to emulate today .
But that does nât stop companies today from starting from scratch , assuming they âre the first to try .
In researching the book the Myths of Innovation I studied how research labs in established companies work , and why they fail .
Here âs why in simple terms :
Ideas are easy .
It âs not hard to find interesting ideas .
They âre everywhere .
Many corporate R&D ( research and development ) groups and universities know how to develop an idea into a prototype .
But developing a prototype into a complete , and marketable product is much harder .
A research lab at a large company could discover perpetual motion and it would still be hard to get release it as a product .

But developing a prototype into a complete , and marketable product is much harder .
A research lab at a large company could discover perpetual motion and it would still be hard to get release it as a product .
Creating an R&D group , or Innovation Team , alienates everyone else .
This is the killer â the limits of sociology kills innovation more often than the limits of technology .
The jargon is technology transfer , which means â how do we get ideas from the R&D group into products ? â
Product teams are very busy with their own projects and have little natural interest in wanting to follow someone else âs plans .
R&D , by design , sets goals unapproachable for product team âs 3/6/12 month horizons and wonder why they âre ignored 90 % of the time , while product teams look at R&D and think they âre insane ( 10 year horizons ?
Will we be alive then ? ) .
Managers love to couch this problem with jargon like â innovation pipelines â and â invention waves â but they âre missing the real challenge â they do nât see the problem as sociology .
R&D groups and product teams naturally resent each other , primarily because the leaders of each group have very different belief systems about what is valuable .
Until those issues are addressed little else matters : great ideas will go nowhere .

R&D never has a service arm .
One obvious way to build camaraderie with product teams is to dedicate 10 % of R&D as a service to Product team engineers .
What problems are too big for release schedules , but too tactical for typical R&D ambitions ?
That âs the sweet spot where technology transfer starts and grass roots level bonds can be made .
Any R&D manager who invests in closing the culture gap buys trust that will help when R&D has a breakthrough idea that ordinarily would scare product teams .
The problem is that R&D ego would see this role as a concession to product team â superiority â , which is why its never been done .

The politics are broken .
Conflicts start at the VP level .
R&D is directed at satisfying VPs , and R&D managers bet that when they deliver a great innovation the VP , or CEO , will do the radical shift from old ideas to new ones .
There are often big egos at work in anyone interested in leading an innovation lab and the hubris is hard to hide .
They underestimate how hard politically these moves are and how rarely they happen .
VPs may have the most power but often that means they are least likely to adopt change since they have the most to lose ( it âs likely rising middle managers on product teams that are at the leverage point of power , ambition and risk taking , not their boss ) .

Everyone wants to feel creative .
Would you want to be told to only work on other people âs ideas ?
Any R&D group faces the challenge of being in the ivory tower : they âre resented as soon as they walk in the door , especially if they throw their PhD âs and research pedigrees around at engineers with different values .
Innovation is a social process that smart motivated people want to participate in â if you propagate the belief that only special people in special roles can do it , something is broken ( see questioning VPs of Innovation ) .

At the end of the day someone has to make the bet .
Good R&D minimizes risk but never eliminates it .
It produces explorations and potentials , but someone has to say â I âm betting my successful and profitable division on new thing X â .
That âs a hard thing to say : I âve never said it , have you ?
Most R&D managers despite their confidence have never said it either and part of why they âre â in research â is their lack of aptitude or interest in business thinking .
In the end every failed R&D effort has a Product VP , or CEO , who was unwilling to take the risk , either for good reasons ( the ideas were not worthy ) or bad ( they did nât believe or did nât have the the courage ) .
No one likes to risk their career based on someone else âs bet .

Government officials now say at least 32 people - in addition to the gunman - have been killed today at Virginia Tech University , making it the deadliest mass shooting in U - S history .
It 's not clear if the gunman killed himself or if he was killed by police .
Witnesses at the school say they saw students jumping out the windows of a classroom building to avoid gunfire .
The first shooting happened in a dorm on one side of campus , and was followed at least two hours later by the shootings in the classroom building , which is on the other side .
Some students say they thought precautions on campus had been lifted after the first shooting .
Mrs Parks ' refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a bus prompted a mass black boycott of buses , organised by Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr .
His protest movement brought about the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which outlawed racial discrimination in the US .
Mrs Parks ' lawyer said she died in her sleep at her home in Detroit , Michigan .
It was revealed last year that she was suffering from progressive dementia .
Mrs Parks ' protest inspired a generation of activists

" She sat down in order that we all might stand up - and the walls of segregation came down , " civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said .
He said her legacy would never die , and added : " In many ways , history is marked as before , and after , Rosa Parks . "
" The nation lost a courageous woman and a true American hero , " Massachusetts Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy said .
" Her quiet fight for equality sounded the bells of freedom for millions , " he said .
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick said : " She 's an example for all people .
For one , I would not be standing here but for her sitting down and standing up at the same time . "

For years before her arrest , Mrs Parks had been active with local civil rights groups , which were looking for a test case to fight the city 's segregation laws .
Her arrest triggered a 381 - day boycott of the bus system organised by the then little - known Rev Luther King Jr , and the protest led to the desegregation of the transport system .
Speaking in 1992 , Mrs Parks said of her famous bus protest : " The real reason of my not standing up was I felt that I had a right to be treated as any other passenger .
We had endured that kind of treatment for too long . "
She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 , and the Congressional Gold Medal , the nation 's highest civilian honour , three years later .
Democratic Congressman John Conyers , from whom she worked in Detroit from 1965 until she retired in 1988 , described her as " an almost saint - like person " .
" She was very humble , she was soft - spoken , but inside she had a determination that was quite fierce . "
Report : Labor shortage and wage inflation in outsourcing market has other countries in hot pursuit .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Surprise !
India 's reign as the world 's " Outsourcing King " may be slipping , even with its rock - bottom call center costs .
A new report from market research firm Gartner , Inc. warns that a labor crunch and rising wages could erode as much as 45 percent of India 's market share by 2007 .
Indian industry watchers acknowledge that the country 's outsourcing industry -- its golden goose of the moment -- is indeed facing a " serious " problem .
In an interview with CNN / Money from New Delhi , Kiran Karnick , president of the National Association of Software and Service companies ( NASSCOM ) , said he 's concerned that these challenges could stymie India 's strong double - digit growth in outsourcing services .
NASSCOM is the trade body representing India 's information technology ( IT ) software and services industry .
More importantly , the Gartner report cautions that a host of emerging countries such as the Philippines , Malaysia , Vietnam and Eastern European nations including Hungary and Poland , are also starting to challenge India 's leadership in offshore business process outsourcing ( BPO . )
Many U.S. and international companies maintain that outsourcing business processes such as customer service call centers , administrative and accounting processes to low - cost and low - wage countries like India helps to keep down their own cost of doing business .
Analysts say India 's " go to " status as a premier outsourcing destination is a function of the country 's vast pool of about 2.5 million mostly English - speaking graduates that are ready to enter the workforce annually .
But India can't afford to rest on its laurels , said Sujay Chohan , one of the authors of the Gartner report and vice president and research director of offshore business process outsourcing with Gartner in New Delhi .
Unless India devises a long - term roadmap to improve infrastructure and consistently grow its skilled labor force , he said India will see some of its offshore BPO clients shift business elsewhere .
" Although India 's infrastructure is improving , it is not keeping pace with the rapid growth of the industry , " the report said .
The Gartner report pointed out that while no single nation yet poses a direct threat to India as a high - quality / low - cost location , over the past two years , more than 50 other countries have emerged that together could pose a viable challenge to India in the months ahead .
Gartner estimates that India 's current 85 percent ownership of the BPO market share could dwindle to about 45 percent by 2007 .
In dollar terms , that would be a significant blow to India , Chohan said .
In 2004 India raked in more than $ 2 billion of an estimated $ 3 billion global offshore BPO market with more than 250,000 workers .
He estimates that the worldwide offshore BPO market will grow to about $ 24 billion by 2007 of which India will earn about $ 13.8 billion .
Rising labor costs Given that India 's been doubling its outsourcing operations every year for the past four years , Chohan said he's not too surprised by the current imbalance in the labor demand - supply equation as well as the onset of wage inflation and high levels of attrition .
" Four years ago , a typical call center employee would have earned between 5,000 to 6,000 rupees ( $ 114 - $ 136 ) a month .
Now it may be up to between 7,000 to 9,000 rupees ( $ 159 - $ 204 ) a month , " he said .
" The rise in labor costs is n't significant yet .
What 's more important is that these increases so far have not been passed on to clients in the U.S. "
But if these costs continue to escalate , he predicts that Indian outsourcing firms will take a hit to their bottom line and eventually start to pass along the increases to their international clients .
Chohan said India could learn from Ireland 's mistakes more than a decade earlier .
" This is exactly what happened in Ireland in the 1990s , " said Chohan .
" As a result , companies that were outsourcing to Ireland began to look elsewhere and discovered India for the lower - level work , " adding that Ireland today still attracts what 's considered to be " high - value " outsourcing such as R&D and software development .
Chohan is n't worried about India losing it lead in IT outsourcing .
" India dominates now and will continue to do so in the future because of the sheer scale of skills in the country at low costs .
The only exception is China which has become very visible in this space within the last six months . "
Moving beyond call centers Ashank Desai , chairman of Mumbai - based Mastek , said one way for Indian companies to maintain their competitive advantage and ensure their international clientele is to upgrade their services by offering more sophisticated back office functions in addition to the basic call center services .
Mastek is a provider of offshore IT and BPO outsourcing services .
The company logged annual sales of $ 130 million in 2004 .
" At Mastek we 're already looking into merging BPO and IT services so that our clients get double the advantage , ' Desai said .
He gave an example , " We can reconfigure IT used for processing insurance claims to make it more efficient and then process these claims more efficiently for our customers . "
In order to emerge as truly global players and undercut the competition , Chohan said Indian outsourcing companies should also think about expanding their brand globally by setting up delivery centers outside of India .
Indian vendors depend too much on the U.S. market .
India has to make inroads into non-English speaking markets as well , " similar to what Ireland has done to successfully service the European market , " he said .
Growing youth turnout is good news for Dems / Phone calls , handshakes , even text messages encouraged those under 30 to go to polls

Two million more young people voted Tuesday than in the 2002 midterm elections -- but not because of trendy new campaigning tactics like uploading videos on YouTube or posting candidates ' profiles on MySpace .
Instead , 18 - to - 29 - year - olds were compelled to vote because of one of the oldest media tactics : Somebody asked them , often in person .
Of course , many were angry with the direction President Bush has taken the country and wanted change , according to a bipartisan exit poll from a youth voter organization .
Put the two factors together -- and add the growing influence of new media tools -- and some analysts say a generation of young voters is solidifying into a Democratic voting bloc .
" The 2006 elections show that Republican campaigns must mobilize their base of young voters to win , " said GOP pollster Ed Goeas , who conducted the poll of 500 18 - to - 29 - year - olds with Democratic pollster Celinda Lake for Young Voter Strategies in Washington , D.C.
The nonpartisan organization is a project of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University .
Tuesday " proved that young voters can and will be a force in elections , " Goeas said .
" Of the 28 seats in the House of Representatives that changed hands so far , 22 were won by less than 2 percent of the vote , 18 by 5,000 or less votes , and 4 by less than 1,000 votes . "
A key factor in wooing these 42 million people : campaigns that reached out and talked to them .
Forty - six percent of the young people in the survey said they were contacted by a candidate or a campaign .
Of those contacted , 28 percent said they received a phone call , and 22 percent got an in - person visit .
Only 3 percent received a text message on their cell phone , and 7 percent were contacted through a social networking site like MySpace or Facebook .
" Reaching young people is not rocket science , " said Dave Rosenfeld , organizing director of the nonpartisan New Voters Project , which registered 75,000 voters and ran outreach programs on 80 college campuses in 15 states .
Voter turnout increased dramatically Tuesday , Rosenfeld said , in precincts with the large college - student populations his project targeted .
" Campaigns are learning that they ignore youth at their own peril , " Rosenfeld said .
More peril could await Republicans if they do n't reach more young voters soon .
According to CNN exit polls , 60 percent of voters under 30 cast ballots for Democrats .
Seventy - eight percent of young people who vote for the same party in three elections in a row are likely to remain a member of that party through adulthood , said pollster Goeas .
" We lost ( the youth vote ) in 2004 by 11 percent , " Goeas said of Republicans .
Now , with that number doubling this year , according to early exit polls , Goeas worried that a generation of the electorate is growing up as reliable Democrats .
According to the bipartisan Goeas - Lake exit polls , 40 percent of young voters said they identify with Democrats , 30 percent with Republicans and 23 percent with independents .
However , half reported that they voted for Democrats , and 35 percent said they cast ballots for Republicans .
Despite Tuesday 's swing , Democrats should n't take young people for granted , said Molly Moon Neitzel , executive director of Music for America in San Francisco .
The organization connected with 3 million young voters this election cycle through MySpace , text messaging and its volunteers , who encouraged voting at the 1,000 concerts it sponsors annually .
" If they ( Democrats ) do n't do something with the power we gave them last night , we wo n't vote for them in 2008 , " Neitzel said Wednesday .
" The jury is still out on Democrats . "
Forty - three percent of young people responding to the Young Voter Strategies poll said the most important issue to them when deciding whom to vote for was the war in Iraq .
They wanted Congress to address education , the expense of college and the economy .
Sixty percent had an unfavorable impression of President Bush .
" The main thing people wanted was change , " said Kathleen Barr with Young Voter Strategies .
But while Music for America sent out 30,000 text messages Monday to remind young people of the election and point them to their polling places , Neitzel and others said the jury also is still out on the power of new media techniques that surfaced in this campaign .
" The 2006 election was an experimental one for new media , " said Peter Leyden , director of the New Politics Institute , a liberal San Francisco think tank that focuses on the intersection of new media tools and politics .
" But even if it was n't fully integrated into campaigns , what things like YouTube did was energize and excite young people about politics . "
Young voters make their mark
The bipartisan polling team of Ed Goeas and Celinda Lake released the initial findings of the first post-election Young Voter Battleground Poll .
The poll looked at motivations for youths going to the polls , surveyed 500 18 - to - 29 - year olds and has a margin of error of +/- 4.4 percentage points .
Key findings : Young voters ...
58 % ... talked a great deal / some with family and friends about the election .
43 % ... said most important issue to them when deciding whom to vote for was the war in Iraq .
60 % ... reported dissatisfaction with the president 's actions on education , college costs , the war in Iraq and the economy .
61 % ... said they believed America is on the wrong track .
31 % ... right track
40 % ... identify with Democrats .
30 % ... identify with Republicans .
23 % ... identify with independents .
35 % ... reported they voted for Republicans .
50 % ... reported they voted for Democrats .

Scientists have found that a gene controlled by the mammalian circadian clock also plays a role in weight gain from high - fat diets .
A team led by Joseph Besharse of the Medical College of Wisconsin and Carla Green of the University of Virginia report in this week 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that when the clock gene Nocturnin was disabled in mice , the animals did not plump up when fed fatty fare .
" We show evidence that the clock itself is behaving correctly in the mutant mouse , " Besharse says , " but various aspects of lipid ands glucose metabolism are disrupted . "
Besharse and Green discovered Nocturnin more than a decade ago .
The gene codes for a protein produced in a number of mammalian tissues â including the liver .
During the day the liver manufactures relatively low levels of the protein , but at night it ramps up its production a hundredfold .
The researchers knocked out the function of Nocturnin in a group of mice .
They then fed some of the mice normal diets , while others received high - fat meals .
The animals on standard diets looked and acted a lot like normal mice :
They were slim , spent time running on a wheel and were active at the same times of the day .
The Nocturnin - deficient mice on high - fat diets , however , showed only slight weight gain , whereas normal mice on the same diet ballooned to twice the size of their mutant counterparts .
In addition , wild mice had large stores of fat around their livers , but the gene - deficit animals did not .
" They 're better off without the gene , I guess , if you 're just looking at obesity , " says Besharse .
However , " the mutant mice have altered glucose metabolism on a standard diet .
It is likely that the Nocturnin [ protein ] , which is produced in multiple tissues â liver , fat cells , pancreas and gut â is affecting glucose and lipid metabolism at multiple levels . "
This , he adds , triggers resistance to the hormone insulin secreted by the pancreas , which ferries glucose from the blood into individual cells , where it is converted to energy .
People with low insulin production or resistance may develop type 2 diabetes .
Besharse says his team will continue to research the gene 's molecular mechanism in the liver as well as in other tissues where its protein is produced , including the eyes , brain and kidneys .
" Certainly it has crossed our minds that [ a drug ] that would inhibit the activity of Nocturnin might influence lipid [ fat ] storage , " Besharse says .
" But that 's way down the road , in terms of research . "
Back in the 1970s , Alexandr Solzhenitsyn , one of the giants of the 20th century , gave a commencement address at Harvard .
It was , I believe , the last public address he gave in America .
His criticism was so dead - on that he quickly became persona non grata .
I âve always thought that it is a permanent disgrace that this great man , whom many Russians credit with bringing down the Soviet Union , was never invited to the White House , while all sorts of two - bit communists and other poltroons have been fted and dined there .
At any rate , apropos of the current headlines , one of the criticisms he levied was that we as a country had become cowards .
He made it clear that he did not mean the American people ; he meant the American government and the American Establishment .
He said they bullied small and weak countries and appeased the powerful .
That was true then , and it âs true today .
Look , for example , at the contrast between George Bush âs rhetoric directed at North Korea and his rhetoric directed at Saddam Hussein .
Saddam , he said , had been given enough chances .
He had run out of time .
There was no point in any more talk .
Blah , blah , etc. Saddam , of course , did nât have nuclear weapons , or even chemical or biological weapons .
With North Korea , the president says we must seek a diplomatic solution , and diplomacy , of course , takes a lot of time , etc. and so forth .
Gosh , we hate to see North Korea so isolated .
What âs the difference ?
Saddam was weak , his regime was a toothless old hag , and Bush and his war hawks knew it .
We could bully and invade him without fear .
North Korea , however , is a regime with very sharp teeth .
It has a fully equipped standing army of more than one million men .
It has artillery wheel - to - wheel along the demilitarized zone .
Even without its missiles , nuclear or conventional , war with North Korea would produce casualties in the tens of thousands , and would do it in a matter of days .
So you âre darn right Bush wants to use diplomacy , though his diplomacy is so inept that it is not likely to work .
We are not going to attack North Korea or even try a " surgical strike , " and North Korea knows this .
It has a deterrent sufficiently strong to persuade us to let the sleeping dog lie on the Korean Peninsula .
You will notice , too , that all the tough rhetoric about Iran has suddenly quieted down .
I think both the U.S. and Israel have finally realized that we have no military option with Iran .
Iran is in a position to cause us unimaginable problems all over the Middle East .
Our failure in Iraq and the Israelis â failure to cower the Palestinians have reminded both countries that the Middle East is not a good place to cause trouble .
It is a place where conventional forces can win tactical victories , but not strategic ones .
T.E. Lawrence , or Lawrence of Arabia if you prefer , noted a characteristic of the Arabs :
They can be suddenly seized with an idea so passionately , he said , that they will willingly lose everything for it .
That âs all the explanation you need for suicide bombers .
There is a line in their psyche that Westerners would do well not to cross .
At any rate , our government and our Establishment remain as cowardly as they were in the 1970s .
Look at the great military " triumphs " in recent years â invading Panama and Grenada , bombing Libya and Serbia , fighting two wars with Iraq .
Any general who wanted a triumphal procession in Rome after victories that petty would have been limited to a single cart pulled by a donkey .
Probably , we do nât have a real peace movement in this country because one is nât needed .
We âre not going to fight anybody who has half a chance of drawing real blood .
We are never going to launch a preventative war against North Korea or Iran , and God knows not against China or Russia .
Perhaps , if Bush ever extricates himself from Iraq and Afghanistan , we might have another go at Somalia .
We are , just as Solzhenitsyn said , the bully of weak countries and an appeaser of strong ones .

The Best of Charley Reese
Mike is getting stressed at work , but that âs just natural these days .
In fact , if Mike is nât stressed , it probably means that he âs not really crucial to the organization .
The solution is to let Mike work less and with fewer responsibilities for a while until he recovers .
Or to let Mike work more for a while until he âs no longer falling behind and getting stressed over that .
And of course to send him on a stress management course to teach him all about stress .
Here âs some typical thinking on workplace stress :
Wrong .
Wrong , wrong , wrong .
Yes , workplace stress is a serious problem .
Yes , the cost to people , businesses and society is enormous .
Yes we must do something about it .
But some myths exist around stress that mean , that most of what we do about it is nât working .
Often , it even makes things worse .
Here are the top 5 myths about workplace stress .
Myth # 1 : Stress is normal â it means you âre important and it âs even good because it pushes you to perform
Some people seem to think that if you âre not too busy , you âre not really crucial to the organization .
These people revel in having full schedules , long working hours and too much work .
But stress does not mean you matter .
It either means that somethings wrong at work or that you âre not doing a good enough job of matching your tasks to your time .
Worse , it also means that you get less work done , because stressed people are less efficient , worse communicators and worse at making good decisions .
To accept stress as a normal condition of work is bad for people and bad for business !
Myth # 2 : Stress is caused by working too much
But then why do some people work 80 hours a week and feel great , while some people work 30 and get serious stress ?
Here âs why : Stress has nothing to do with the number of hours you work , and everything to do with how you feel during those hours .
If you work 100 hours a week feeling great , doing something meaningful to you , having fun , feeling supported by you boss and co-workers and taking pride in what you do , you wo nât be stressed .
If you work 30 hours a week feeling inadequate , bullied or unappreciated you will be stressed .
Myth # 3 : Stress is cured by working less
Most workplaces react to stress by reducing employees â workloads , responsibilities or working hours and in serious cases by giving people long sick leaves .
According to Danish medical researcher Bo NetterstrÃ¸m who has studied workplace stress for 30 years , this is a mistake .
People hit by stress need to increase their capacity and confidence at work , and while time off from work can be necessary to treat the immediate symtoms of stress , a long absence from the workplace does exactly the opposite .
When people return to the workplace , they âre even more vulnerable than before .
Worse , some never return to work at all .
Also , reducing work or leaving work remporarily does nât fix any underlying problems .
When employees return to work or to â normal â work conditions , nothing has changed and the stress returns quickly .
Myth # 4 : Stress is cured by working more
â Yes , I âm a little stressed at work right now because we âre falling behind .
If I work really hard for a while I âll catch up and it will go away . â
No it wo nât .
For three reasons :
Workplace stress does not come from falling behind at work .
It comes from how you feel about falling behind .
In most businesses , people will always be behind .
There is simply too much work and finishing all your tasks simply means getting assigned more work .
Working more hours often means getting less work done thus falling further behind .
Here âs why .
A temporary push to reduce a pile of work or meet a deadline is fine .
But all too often that temporary push becomes the new standard .
So the solution to stress is not to work harder to catch up because in most workplaces this is impossible .
The solution is to feel good about the work you finish and not to get stressed about the work you do nât finish .
It âs not that you should stop caring , it âs just that you should remember that being stressed makes you less productive , which means you get less work done and become more stressed .
That âs a vicious circle right there and we need to break it .
Myth # 5 : Stress is cured by focusing on stress
I âve seen a lot of the literature and training about workplace stress , and the typical content is :
What is stress
Symptoms of stress
Health implications of stress
How to fight stress
This is often presented by a stress consultant .
Here in Denmark that consultant may even come from the rather unfortunately named Center for Stress ( shouldnÂt that be against stress ? )
A recent study showed that people who return from anti-stress training felt more stressed than people who did nât attend .
No wonder , because focusing on stress is not the way to remove it â it âs a great way to create more stress .
Instead , you must focus on what gives you peace and energy .
Here âs a great way to do that every day at work .
The truth about stress
Repeat after me : Work does not give you stress .
Feeling bad about work gives you stress .
This means thant changing your workhours , your responsibilities , your priorities or your work environment is meaningless , unless it also changes the way you feel at work .
Those stress management courses will not do the trick either , unless they can achieve just that .
If you âre stressed , you must take charge and make whatever changes are necessary to go from feeling anxious , inadequate or drained at work to feeling appreciated , proud and energetic .
Which will not only remove workplace stress , but will also make you more efficient , creative , successful and happy at work .

Rep. Tom Davis ( R - VA ) this morning summed up in one pithy nugget why Americans are sick of Republicans .
In questioning outed CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson , Davis actually attempted to lay the blame for her blown cover at the feet of the CIA itself .
Seems that it sticks in Davis ' craw that though the Intelligence Identities Protection Act ( IIPA ) requires that the CIA take affirmative steps to protect the identities of undercover operatives , and though it is therefore required by law that the CIA report regularly to the Congress on its activities toward that end , such reports have not in fact been filed .
The CIA , Davis argues , is therefore at fault because it has not met its obligations under the law .
Of course , this revelation occurs to Davis only now , in relation to this nearly four year old story , and not at any time during his tenure as Chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee , when he could have actually done something about the lack of reporting .
This is why Americans are sick of Republicans , and took the keys away from them in the last election .
And it's why they 'll continue to boot even more of them from office .
It 's because of the shocking hypocrisy of even " moderates " like Tom Davis , who pretend not only that it's the CIA 's fault when a Republican White House engineers the outing of a vitally important undercover officer , but does n't even blush when he suggests that it happened due to his own failure to exercise oversight .
Tom Davis , asleep at the wheel , finally has " tough questions " ... for the fencepost he crashed into .
A gotcha objection is a proposition that your idea is false based on a premise that is true infrequently or only true for some small number of cases .

Therefore , we should build what we know we âll need . â
â Some bugs simply ca nât be found through automated unit tests , sorry .
This is why we have to use a programming language with static typing . â

The casino âs strategy is so secure , there is just one danger to its profits : if the casino plays very few games for very high stakes relative to their capitalization , they could lose their capital .
The casino must have an edge on each play ;
The more games played , the more likely that the casino will profit overall ;
Runs of good luck for some gamblers are offset by runs of bad luck for other gamblers .

Henk Tijms âs Understanding probability explains probability in simple terms requiring very little mathematics .
Examples drawn from everyday life include analyzing investment returns , lotteries , and gambling .
The book continues to build on the basics , worthing through Bayes ' theorem up to multivariate and conditional distributions .
A must - read for those working with data or seeking to understand risk analysis .
Arrange a small advantage on each game played ;
Play a very large amount of games ;
Ignore good and bad runs , they will offset each other ;
Do not risk large amounts of capital on games played very few times .
The process of developing software is just like the business of running a casino .
Does it offer a probable advantage each time it is employed ?
Can it be employed many times ?
Do streaks of â losses â and â wins â offset each other ?
Can we avoid risking the entire outcome of the project infrequent events ?
Does it offer a larger or smaller mathematical edge over the practice it replaces ?
In other words , does it lose less often ?
Can it be applied more or less often than the idea it replaces ?
In other words , how much benefit can we obtain from it ?
â When teams are disciplined about not writing code that wo nât be needed in the current iteration , we get more of the features developed earlier , where we can analyse and learn from them .
This lowers our technical and requirements risk .
Of course , sometimes this means that they have to throw stub or temporary scaffolding code out later , so there is some wasted code . â
â When projects are written using dynamic languages , they can use techniques like meta- programming to write less code and to concentrate the green code in one place .
Of course , we do not have the compiler telling us about certain types of errors . â
Ask whether you can balance the benefits of using the practice when it wins against the cost of using the practice when it loses , and evaluate the overall benefit in comparison to the benefits and costs of the alternative and see whether you would get more of a benefit over one entire project , or ;
Ask whether you can compare the success rate of teams using the practice to the success rate of teams using the alternative in aggregate , or ;
Both .
In Part I of â What I âve Learned from Sales , â Do nât Feed the Trolls , we looked at why resistance to a new idea is expressed as a never - ending series of objections .
We looked at one powerful way to avoid objections , by identifying a real , urgent problem that needs to be solved .
The next installment , Part III , How to use a blunt instrument to sharpen your saw , describes the mind - set that there are opportunities for improvement to be found everywhere .
In this part , we âre going to disregard my advice to avoid objections and talk about one way to respond to many of the objections raised against new ideas .
Right off the top , I want to say that I do nât believe you can â overcome â an objection by frontal assault .
And furthermore , you should nât try .
You cannot persuade someone to consider an idea by debating them into submission .
My belief is that you must discover and address their true problem .
The first reason to do so is that if they do not have a problem your idea can solve , there is no reason for them to â change for change âs sake . â
The second reason is that if you are not solving a real , genuine problem for them you will get caught defending an idea against an endless series of objections .
That being said , there are some circumstances where it is important to respond directly to objections .
Even if we have carefully qualified someone âs problem and explained how a new idea will solve their problem , a prudent person will analyse the idea carefully , looking for fatal defects that could prevent it from solving their problem .
Another common circumstance is when there are several parties involved in presenting , discussing , and analysing an idea .
Although one of the parties may be bringing up irrelevant objections to resist the idea , you may need to persuade another of the parties that these irrelevant objections do not have merit .
For example , you may be suggesting that agile meta- programming will solve a company âs problems to the CEO .
You may have carefully qualified the CEO âs priorities .
But the company âs IT department will raise objections because your proposals do not address their personal and departmental problems .
So you will need to respond to some of their objections as part of a campaign to neutralize their influence .
Overcoming an objection is , to borrow a phrase from law , â A sword , not a shield . â
When you overcome an objection , you point out that the reason for not considering your new idea is fallacious , or does not apply in this case .
However , overcoming the objection does not actually provide a reason to change : it merely removes a reason not to change .
This is why Part I goes on and on about discovering an immediate problem your idea can fix .
If you overcome an objection but have not presented a compelling reason to change , nothing will happen .
In other words , if someone says â I like your idea , however ... â you should attempt to overcome the objection .
If someone says â Your idea stinks because ... â you really need to identify a problem to solve .
Let âs assume you are going to respond to an objection , and you have good reason for doing so .
Here âs one common form of objection , and a method for responding to the objection .
In essence , I am going to share a pattern with you .
First , let âs look at one of the most common kinds of objections .
Here are some examples .
They all have something in common :
What these objections all have in common is what I call the â gotcha ! â fallacy .
The underlying assumption is that if your idea does not work 100 % of the time , on 100 % of the cases , it is no damn good .
And thus I call an objection based on the gotcha fallacy a .
A gotcha objection is a proposition that your idea is false based on a premise that is true infrequently or only true for some small number of cases .
Think about therapies in medicine .
None of them are deterministic !
Every pill , every technique , every therapy is described in probabilistic terms :
When compared to the control group who drank a glass of red wine daily but did little exercise , 36.7 % of those who combined daily exercise with a glass of red wine had an average improvement of 22.1 % in their combined evaluation scores for cardiovascular health .
Try this the next time you âre at the doctor âs office : point out to your physician that you have heard that some people who exercise drop dead right after their daily run .
Use this as an excuse not to exercise .
Now , software development is not the same thing as medicine , and I am not suggesting you respond to criticism by saying that since some drugs do not work for some patients that your ideas have merit regardless of evidence or suggestions to the contrary .
But I will walk you through the reasoning that leads to the same conclusion .
Our pattern for responding to these gotcha objections is to establish that software development is probabilistic in practice .
Once we establish this premise , we then turn the debate from whether there are cases where a particular practice does not appear to be optimal to whether the overall results of applying that practice is better than not applying that practice .
That âs it , and if you âre in a hurry you can stop right here : everything else is an elaboration of this idea . :
â Sometimes you are gonna need it , so you âre wasting time if you do nât build it in from the beginning .
Therefore , we should build what we know we âll need . â :
Well , sometimes you need it , sometimes you do nât .
And when you do nât need it , you save the code you would have written as well as all the other design that becomes coupled to the code you end up throwing out .
Of course , sometimes you end up throwing out some stub code , but think about the possibility that you will wind up getting more features done , earlier in the cycle where we can get feedback and reduce risk .
Why do nât we look at whether , in aggregate , more projects will succeed using YAGNI than will succeed using â Build everything we might need â ? :
â Some bugs simply ca nât be found through automated unit tests , sorry .
This is why we have to use a programming language with static typing . â :
Sure enough , some ca nât be detected with automated unit tests .
But our choice of a dynamic language provides us with many other benefits , most especially in the areas of metaprogramming and code reduction .
By writing less code , we may even have fewer bugs overall .
Should nât we try to compare similar projects written in a static language against those written in a dynamic language , and see whether the projects in the dynamic language had fewer bugs and whether the projects written in the dynamic language were more likely to be successful ?
Now that you have seen the results of applying the technique , we will patiently examine the reasoning in detail .
There are two schools of thought about the practice of managing software development ( the theory of managing software development is of little use to us because â the gap between theory and practice is larger in theory than it is in practice â ) .
One school is that everything is fully deterministic in practice ( â Theory D â ) .
If development appears , from the outside , to be probabilistic , it is only because we have nât discovered the â hidden variables â that fully determine the outcome of software development projects .
And , since we are talking about development in practice , it is practical to measure the variables that determine the outcome such that we can predict that outcome in advance .
The other school of thought is that development is fully probabilistic in practice ( â Theory P â ) , that there are no hidden variables that could be used to predict with certainty the outcome of a software development project .
Theory P states that the time and effort required to measure all of the variables influencing a software development project precisely enough to predict the outcome with certainty and in advance exceeds the time and effort required develop the software .
Theory P does not mean that software development cannot be managed in such a way that the desired outcome is nearly certain : the flight of an airplane is fully probabilistic as it encounters atmospheric conditions , yet we have a huge industry built around the idea that airplanes arrive at their destinations and land on the runway as planned .
Which theory fits the evidence collected in sixty years of software development ?
To date , Theory P is the clear winner on the evidence , and it âs not even close .
Like any reasonable theory , it explains what we have observed to date and makes predictions that are tested empirically every day .
( Sidebar : do not confuse Computer Science â the study of the properties of computing machines â with Software Development , the employment of humans to build computing machines .
The relationship between Computer Science and Software Development parallels the relationship between Engineering , the hard science of the behaviour of constructions , and Project Management , the employment of humans to construct engineered artefacts . )
Before we can go anywhere with gotcha objections , there is something you absolutely , positively must do when you respond .
And it must be the very first thing you do .
You must establish the fact that the premise of the objection is not universal and not predictable , it is probabilistic .
The objection is of the form that â since your idea works out badly some of the time , your whole idea is bad . â
You must respond by establishing that some of the time the idea does nât appear to work out , and some of the time it does appear to work out .
It is nât universally bad or universally good .
If you are in a face to face discussion , you can solicit agreement from the objecting party .
For example :
In a less interactive environment like a running language flame war on Usenet , you can start by simply stating that the premise is not universal .
Having established that the premise is not universal you must then establish that the cases where the premise applies are not easily distinguished from the cases where the premise does not apply .
Establish that nobody knows whether the premise will apply or not until after it has happened .
We simply canât tell in advance whether the bugs that would be caught by a static type system will end up being significant to the outcome of a project .
We ca nât tell in advance which constructs will end up being a waste of time .
And we ca nât tell in advance which people will fail when they try to pair program .
( The last point is absolutely true if the people involved are not doing the arguing about whether pair programming will work .
If the programmers involved do not believe it will work , they may have a point . )
This is the other aspect of establishing that the premise is probabilistic : not only does it only apply some of the time , but we do nât have a good way of knowing in advance when it applies and when it does nât .
Okay , we âve gone through all of this dry pseudo - academic talk of theories and probabilistic development .
Time for a vacation to Las Vegas .
Casinos make money by wagering money on the outcome of games with gamblers .
( If the gambling industry offends you , I apologize .
We could choose to look at how insurance companies make money , it is entirely the same thing . )
The games are arranged in such a way they the casino holds a small mathematical edge on each play .
Over the long run , with many gamblers playing the games many , many times , the casino inexorably makes money .
The casino may lose games here and there , and some gamblers may enjoy temporary winning streaks , but overall , the casino wins more than it loses .
The very briefest exploration of statistics reveals the following facts about the casino âs strategy for making money :
In fact , the casino âs strategy is so secure , there is just one danger to its profits ( besides the obvious fear of losing their license to print money ) : if the casino plays very few games for very high stakes relative to their capitalization , they could lose their capital .
One celebrated â whale , â Akio Kashiwagi , won more than $ 19 million in one casino and on another occasion won $ 6 million in a siangle session playing baccarat for $ 200,000 a hand .
Therefore , the casino âs prime safeguard is to avoid risking large amounts of capital on games played very few times .
To summarize , the casino âs strategy is to :
Now that we know the casino âs strategy , let âs consider how they evaluate games .
Imagine them sitting around a conference table , and someone suggests , â Let âs create a new game , Alaska Freeze . â
What do they use to evaluate whether to add this new game to their casino ?
Space in a casino is at a premium .
If Alaska Freeze goes in , something else comes out .
So there has to be an Incremental Value calculation : do they make more money with Alaska Freeze in and something else out ?
Or less ?
This calculation has two simple components : does Alaska Freeze have a larger or smaller mathematical edge than whatever it replaces , and will Alaska Freeze be played more or less often than whatever it replaces ?
Ok , let âs return to handling gotcha objections .
I âm sure you knew all of this , I was just presenting it in a palatable morsel so you can feed it to someone objecting to your idea .
You are handling an objection and you have established that its premise is neither universal nor predictable , it is probabilistic .
Well , if it has an uncertain outcome , it is just like a casino game .
And the process of developing software is just like the business of running a casino .
So the question is not whether a new practice ever has a case where it appears to â lose , â for the same reason that evaluating a new game for a casino does not involve worrying about whether gamblers will ever win .
The way to evaluate the idea is to examine it and see whether it fits the casino model :
And if it does , to identify what idea or practice it replaces to determine whether it is a net win or a net loss overall :
Now , I am not going to say that XP , YAGNI , or dynamically typed programming languages necessarily fit the casino model and are necessarily better than the practices they replace ( Classical Project Management , BDUF , and static typing ) .
But what I will say is that there is a huge difference between saying â some of the time , for some of the people , that idea loses â and saying â overall , when applied to an entire project , the project does worse than whatever idea it replaced .
â So to handle a gotcha objection , we establish that it is probabilistic in nature , then we analyse it as we would analyse any other probabilistic practice : we look at the overall effect of the practice on the entire project , comparing it to whatever practice it would replace .
And I have some easy - to - remember phrases for doing that .
The next step is rather obvious .
You have to state the payoff those times that your idea or practice â wins . â
And to be fair , you also have to agree to the cost of your idea or practice when it â loses .
â Needless to say , if you are in a face to face meeting you should solicit agreement to this second response as well .
If you ca nât establish that there are any benefits to your suggested practice , you have a great deal more work to do to handle this objection .
The final step is the clincher .
Having established that the objection âs premise is probabilistic , and that for those times the idea or practice â wins â there is a positive payoff , it âs time to compare the overall benefit of the idea or practice to whatever it replaces .
You want to shift the debate from debating the premise to debating the overall benefit .
And in fact , there are two different forms of the clincher .
You can use either , or preferably both :
And here are the example responses again , demonstrating the three forms of clincher : : â Sometimes you are gonna need it , so you âre wasting time if you do nât build it in from the beginning .
Therefore , we should build what we know we âll need . â :
Well , sometimes you need it , sometimes you do nât .
And when you do nât need it , you save the code you would have written as well as all the other design that becomes coupled to the code you end up throwing out .
Of course , sometimes you end up throwing out some stub code , but think about the possibility that you will wind up getting more features done , earlier in the cycle where we can get feedback and reduce risk .
Why do nât we look at whether , in aggregate , more projects will succeed using YAGNI than will succeed using â Build everything we might need â ? :
â Some bugs simply ca nât be found through automated unit tests , sorry .
This is why we have to use a programming language with static typing . â :
Sure enough , some ca nât be detected with automated unit tests .
But our choice of a dynamic language provides us with many other benefits , most especially in the areas of metaprogramming and code reduction .
By writing less code , we may even have fewer bugs overall .
Should nât we try to compare similar projects written in a static language against those written in a dynamic language , and see whether the projects in the dynamic language had fewer bugs and whether the projects written in the dynamic language were more likely to be successful ?
Good luck handling objections .
What is your experience : do you have another technique you can recommend ?
As Mike pointed out in the first comment , this post explains how to handle this one type of objection , the gotcha objection , by moving the debate away from the exception case and towards the overall case .
But it does not follow up by presenting hard data to justify the example ideas presented .
First , I want to say that even with hard data you will not foster change with numbers : you need to show how your idea addresses an urgent priority .
That should have happened before you got to this point .
If you have addressed the problem correctly , it really is sufficient to point out the fallacy in the objection and allow your original argument to stand .
Second , there is a dearth of hard data about anything to do with software development .
Repeat after me : â the plural of anecdote is not data . â
If you have a source of hard data about any practice , be it programming languages , practices , or even interviewing techniques , I would very much like to read and learn from it .
Does this mean that we should never change , that since there âs nothat new ideas are an improvement over old ones ?
If you are happy with your current situation , maybe not .
If you are unhappy with your current situation , if you want things to be better , you may want to change something .
It âs your call .

1. Bryan shows that education is the best predictor of what makes a person think like an economist .
This will create problems for his next book , which is a critique of education .
He also urges professors to teach better ; he is again putting his faith in education .
2 . I âm amazed that the public is as rational and smart as it is .
Few people demand that our leaders resort , say , to the tools of superstition , even though many people believe in astrology .
Our political irrationality is highly selective and self - serving in a " feel good about ourselves " way , rather than indiscriminate .
I do nât understand what , in Bryan âs theory , prevents voters from satiating in irrationality , with truly dire social consequences .
He writes of " a demand for irrationality " in stripped down Beckerian fashion , but the model in the back of his mind has a great more structure in it than the book lets on .
The sheep on the cover , for instance , do not play a formal role in the model of the book , even though conformism both eggs on and constrains real world political irrationality .
3. Voters are less irrational in many northern European countries .
I do nât agree with their socialistic view of the world , but in epistemically procedural terms they are making a much greater effort to get at the truth and put that truth into their vote .
What accounts for such a difference ?
4. Bryan comes dangerously close to agreeing with me on broad matters of politics .
I think public opinion , for better or worse , is often a constraint on what is possible ; that is why Henry Farrell described my view as " big government libertarianism . "
Bryan sees opinion as a variable to be manipulated , but he could equally well consider it as a constraint .
His proposal to take more matters out of democratic hands begs the question of how this could be possible , given current public opinion .
5. Bryan underrates the irrationality of many private decisions .
He views " decisiveness " as the most important quality in predicting the quality of an individual choice .
I think that even if our elections were up to one decisive voter , that voter would still choose lots of batty policies or politicians .
I view pride and self - image as the most important features in predicting the quality of an individual choice .
When our pride is at stake , we often self - deceive and make bad and irrational choices , even when we are purely decisive .
I âm not convinced , for instance , that most people make very rational decisions about marriage .
Or status goods , or giving to charity .
In these cases people often " look the other way " when they should be exercising their critical judgment .
Here is the book âs introduction .
Note that my criticisms , even if they are correct , do not puncture the major theses of the book .
Information wants to be free
Why settle for third - and fourth - hand explanations and retelling of the most important work ever conducted in Computer Science and Cryptography ?

Novelty counts .
Try to think of a really unique way to generate the bits .
Imagine you are determined to protect our freedom to program .
Once the Monopolistic Overloards detect that a particular program produces illegal codes , they will send cease - and - desist letters to anyone distributing that program .
Therefore , the greater good is served by collecting many different ways to generate the 128 bits of information .
Or if you prefer a less weighty objective , imagine this is a job interview question .
If the interviewers have seen your solution before , you wo nât stand out from the crowd .

You may express the 128 bits of output in any other form you like , however more complex or obscure formulations â such as steganographic images â should be accompanied by a method or program to recover the output into numeric form .

Here âs a programming challenge : Furthermore : Come on folks , we âre programmers .
We probably blew millions of person - hours writing programs that counted from one to one hundred .
Let âs stand up and prove that when the chips are down , we can invest a few minutes and write something that âs both interesting to code and meaningful .
What âs the smallest program that produces the 128 bits ?
Can it be done in pure lambda calculus ?
Is there a self - modifying program that turns itself into the 128 bits ?
Can it be done with an Enterprisey Servive - Oriented Architecture ?
Haskell ?
C# ?
Let âs really do this right !!
Follow - up : Quality
There was one proposal in Sir Rod Eddington 's report to the Treasury with which , when I first read it , I wholeheartedly agreed .
He insists that " the transport sector , including aviation , should meet its full environmental costs " .
Quite right too : every time someone dies as a result of floods in Bangladesh , an airline executive should be dragged out of his office and drowned .
Reading on , I realised that this is not exactly what he had in mind .
Instead , he meant that airports can keep expanding and the capacity of roads can be increased , as long as people pay more money for their pollution .
He has even been so kind as to put a price on other people 's lives : Â£ 70 per tonne of carbon .
This , we discover , is the " social cost " of global warming , derived by the British government 's department for the environment , and unquestioningly accepted by Eddington , who was charged by Gordon Brown with keeping the country moving .
But what the heck does it mean ?
Does the government believe we can put a price on Bangladesh ?
On the people threatened by drought in the Horn of Africa ?
On coral reefs , rainforests and tundra ?
On the security of global food supplies ?
When the Stern review was published , some of us warned that people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing would interpret it as a licence to reduce the argument to a dispute about financial costs .
This is what Eddington has now done .
As long as the books are balanced , the problem is deemed to have been solved .
Even if we were to accept his outrageous terms of reference , and even if we were to agree with his proposition that an ever - expanding transport sector is compatible with " sustainability " , there is an omission in Eddington 's report .
It is a dirty word beginning with c , which can not be uttered in the presence of politicians .
In 436 pages , the coach is mentioned only in the last volume , and then just to provide historical price comparisons with other modes of transport .
As a current or future option , it does not , in Eddington 's world , exist .
But few measures would go so far towards meeting his goal of " improving the capacity and performance of the existing transport network " than persuading people to switch from cars to coaches .
The M25 has 790 miles of lanes .
If these are used by cars carrying the average load of 1.6 occupants , at 60 mph the road 's total capacity is just - wait for it - 19,000 people .
Coaches travelling at the same speed , each carrying 30 passengers , raise the M25's capacity to 260,000 .
Every coach swallows up a mile of car traffic .
They also reduce carbon emissions per passenger mile by an average of 88 % .
So one of the key tasks for anyone who wants to unblock the roads while reducing the real social costs of carbon must be to make coach travel attractive .
But how ?
When I take the bus from Oxford to Cambridge , I arrive feeling almost suicidal .
First I must cycle for 20 minutes in the wrong direction , into the city centre .
Then I sit on a chair designed to extract confessions , and wait .
When , at last , the coach departs , it fights through streets designed for ponies .
After half an hour it leaves the city .
It then charts a course through just about every depressing dormitory town in south - east England .
On a good day , with a following wind , the journey from my house to my final destination in Cambridge , a total of 83 miles , takes four and a half hours .
The average speed is 18 miles an hour , about 50 % faster than I travel by bicycle .
By car you could do it in 100 minutes .
The reason for this misery is simple : the system is unbelievably stupid .
It is a hangover from the time when coaches were pulled by horses , and were probably faster .
A far better scheme has been proposed by a visionary economist called Alan Storkey .
Storkey 's key innovation is to move coach stations out of city centres , to the junctions of motorways .
One of the reasons long coach journeys are so slow in the UK is that - in order to create a system that allows passengers to transfer from one coach to another - they must enter the towns along the way , travelling into the centre and out again .
In the rush hour you might as well walk .
Instead of dragging motorway transport into the cities , Storkey 's system drags city transport out to the motorways .
Urban buses on their way out of town , he proposes , keep travelling to the nearest motorway junction , where they meet the coaches .
By connecting urban public transport to the national network , Storkey 's proposal could revitalise both systems , as it provides more frequent and more viable bus services for the suburbs .
The coaches would never leave the trunk roads and motorways .
Some services would constantly circle the orbital roads ; others would travel up and down the motorways that connect to them .
You would change from one coach to another at the junctions .
Just 200 coaches on the M25 , Storkey calculates , would ensure an average waiting time of between two and three minutes .
They would be given dedicated lanes and priority at traffic lights , disentangling them from the cars that now hold them up and force them to bunch .
The tabloid newspapers might fulminate , but it would not be long before people stuck in their cars began to notice the buses roaring past on the inside .
With faster links to the motorways provided by dedicated urban bus lanes , and relief from the need to find a parking space , this could bring the overall journey time to below that of car travel .
At rush hours and on bank holiday weekends the public system could be very much faster .
It might even be made comfortable .
Double - deckers could increase the leg room without losing much fuel efficiency , and why should n't every coach have TV screens and power points ?
In other words , the country 's slowest , most uncomfortable and most depressing form of mass transport could be transformed into one of its fastest , smoothest and most convenient systems .
An effective coach system could make a serious dent in car sales , and even reduce the demand for domestic flights .
Storkey 's system costs next to nothing .
It requires no new roads , no railway lines , no major public subsidies .
If the land now occupied by coach stations is sold , it could be self - financing from inception .
It 's a much better use of private money , too : capital investment in coaches is roughly 10 times more efficient than the same investment in cars .
You might have expected the financial case to have touched even Sir Rod Eddington 's shrivelled heart .
Eddington 's refusal to consider the form of transport that could make best use of our existing infrastructure is a disgraceful oversight .
It suggests that his review might have less to do with meeting our transport needs than with meeting the needs of his chums in big business , for whom an efficient coach system represents a dangerous form of competition .
But when the government hired the former chief executive of British Airways to reorganise the transport sector , what else did it expect ?
Â· George Monbiot 's book Heat : How to Stop the Planet Burning is published by Penguin

Pharyngula has picked up a Nature Genetics paper about the influence of stochastic , non-heritable effects in determining lifespan in the worm C. elegans .
I âd encourage you to read PZ âs lengthy analysis yourself , but here âs an excerpt of the summary portion of his posting :
â¦ [ I ] n humans only about 25 % of the variation in life span can be ascribed to genetic factors to any degree , and even in lab animals where variables can be greatly reduced , only 10 - 40 % of the life span variation has a genetic component .
â¦
Life is like a long dice game , and while starting with a good endowment might let you keep playing for a longer time , eventually everyone craps out , and a run of bad luck can wipe out even the richest starting position rapidly .
In between these extremes of genetic predetermination and pure luck , though , a recent paper in Nature Genetics finds another possibility : factors in the organism that are not heritable , yet from an early age can be reasonably good predictors of mortality .
Here âs the experiment .
Start with an isogenic line of Caenorhabditis elegans â¦
When raising a colony of isogenic animals , of course , they do nât all abruptly kick the bucket on the same day at the end of their maximum lifespan ( under two months for these worms ) , but instead a few die every day until they are all gone .
The question is , is there anything that will allow one to predict whether a newly hatched worm will die in one week , or in 8 weeks ?
The specific variable studied is the extent of expression of an hsp-16.2 - GFP transgene .
The authors find that among an isogenic population , worms with the highest level of transgene expression in early life live the longest .
( That animals with higher chaperone expression live longer is not particularly surprising in itself ; the key result of the paper is that genetically identical animals express this particular chaperone to varying degrees , and the particular level of early - life chaperone expression in a particular animal has a significant impact on how long that individual will ultimately live . )
Hence early - life variation can control late - life outcomes , consistent with the observations of McCarroll et al. , who showed in 2004 that much of the conserved transcriptional program of aging is implemented in early adulthood .
The study of variation in gene expression , already underway in relationship to aging ( see our earlier post , Genomic instability and transcriptional noise ) , is almost exclusively performed in single cells .
It âs exciting to see it happening in an intact metazoan , and furthermore to see the impact of the observed variation on a physiological endpoint of such significance ( i.e. , lifespan ) .
Where I live the interest rate on a brick - and - mortar savings account with a $ 100 minimum balance is 0.10 % .
Yes , 1/10 of one percent .
If you âre willing to keep a minimum balance of $ 10,000 , that rate increases to 0.40 % .
Compared to that , a rate of 4.50 % to 5.05 % ( or more , with a promotional rate ) with a $ 1 minimum balance at banks like ING Direct , HSBC , and Emigrant Direct probably seems too good to be true .
But it âs not .
So what âs the catch ?
Really , the only catch is that you ca nât walk up in person to your online - only savings account to make a withdrawal or deposit and have it take effect almost immediately .
You have to make withdrawals and deposits over the computer , and they take between 2 - 5 days ( depending on the bank ) .
You also have to have an account at another institution to transfer money to and from .
There are no fees for the transfers , unless your other bank charges one .
( Most do nât . )
And like the banks that pay the 1/10 to 4/10 of a percent interest on savings accounts , these online banks are FDIC insured .
They just give you more money , because their overhead is lower .
Chicago - I HAVE never met Sgt. Santos Cardona or Sgt. Michael Smith , but we share similar experiences .
In late 2003 and early 2004 , both men used their dogs to intimidate Iraqi prisoners during interrogations at Abu Ghraib prison .
They maintain that they were following legal orders .
Now they both face impending court - martial .
From January 2004 to January 2005 , I served in various places in Iraq ( including Abu Ghraib ) as an Army interrogator .
Following orders that I believed were legal , I used military working dogs during interrogations .
I terrified my interrogation subjects , but I never got intelligence ( mostly because 90 percent of them were probably innocent , but that 's another story ) .
Perhaps , I have thought for a long time , I also deserve to be prosecuted .
But if that is the case , culpability goes much farther up the chain of command than the Army and the Bush administration have so far been willing to admit .
When the chief warrant officer at our interrogation site in Mosul first told me to use dogs during interrogations , it seemed well within what was allowed by our written rules and consistent with what was being done at Abu Ghraib and other detention centers .
The dogs were muzzled and held by a handler .
The prisoners did n't know that , though , because they were blindfolded ; if they gave me an answer I did n't like , I could cue the handler so the dog would bark and lunge toward them .
Sometimes they were so terrified they'd wet their jumpsuits .
About halfway through my tour , I stopped using dogs and other " enhancements " like hypothermia that qualify as torture even under the most nonchalant readings of international law .
I could n't handle being so routinely brutal .
In training , we learned that all P.O.W.'s are protected against actual and implied threats .
You can never put a " knife on the table " to get someone to talk .
That was clear .
But our Iraqi prisoners were n't clearly classified as P.O.W.'s , so I never knew what laws applied .
Instead , a confusing set of verbal and written orders had supplanted the Geneva Conventions .
The Ã¢â¬ ÅDior AddictÃ¢â¬Â marketing campaign for cosmetics and perfume ( werenÃ¢â¬â¢t there the shirts as well ? ) launched a few years ago , peddling luxury goods and the accompanying addiction .
Christian Dior doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t use the Ã¢â¬ÅAdmit ItÃ¢â¬Â tagline anymore , but thatÃ¢â¬â¢s just as well .
DonÃ¢â¬â¢t admit it .
In fact , donÃ¢â¬â¢t even have a paper trail of the purchase .
Shivani VoraÃ¢â¬â¢s Ã¢â¬ ÅMoney DoesnÃ¢â¬â¢t TalkÃ¢â¬Â is an article in the New York Times about the growing trend of paying cash for luxury goods among women in order to avoid justifying purchases to husbands , boyfriends or parents .
Women are doing this , Vora says , even when itÃ¢â¬â¢s their own money that they are spending .
Of all the reasons cited for the increase in cash payments at luxury boutiques , hiding an addiction is conspicuously absent .

Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ ËTraditionally , women are supposed to be altruistic and put others first and arenÃ¢â¬â¢t supposed to lavish on themselves , Ã¢â¬â¢ said Kathleen Gerson , a professor of sociology at New York University and an author of Ã¢â¬ ÅThe Time Divide : Work , Family , and Gender Inequality.Ã¢â¬â¢
Women hide their personal purchases to cope with this labeling , she said .Ã¢â¬ Â
This theory recalls Depression or WWII - era thinking and it applied to both men and women .
Though the social script of putting others first may have lingered on through the Baby Boom , it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t apply today .
In fact , IÃ¢â¬â¢d say that this theory is apologist crap .
I have known men who blew irrational amounts of money and tried to hide it , too .
This simply suggests a spending problem .
a wartime poster advocating conservation
Last summer my sister found out that her receptionist , DÃÂ©jÃ , was using company money to buy stuff on the internet .
Clothes , mostly .
When she was confronted she burst into tears , admitting that her purchasing was out of control and that she was trying in earnest to deal with the problem .
The theatrics worked , IÃ¢â¬â¢m sorry to say , and DÃÂ©jÃ was never prosecuted for her crime because my sister felt the publicity might ruin the career of her high - profile husband .
I believe that DÃÂ©jÃ Ã¢â¬â¢s addiction is in its advanced stage : insistence of guilt or regret was a show sheÃ¢â¬â¢s probably put on before and IÃ¢â¬â¢m confident she will lock on to another target now that sheÃ¢â¬â¢s left town .
Guilt , in other words , is a healthy sign that you know itÃ¢â¬â¢s wrong to have succumbed to an urge , to have been so easily played .
While putting others first doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t define my gender role anymore , it was and still is batshit crazy for anyone to spend $ 2000 on a tote .
I confess that in the past IÃ¢â¬â¢ve collectively laid down an obscene amount of cash for clothes and felt guilty about it .
I donÃ¢â¬â¢t have those cravings anymore because IÃ¢â¬â¢m confident I can make much of what I see in store windows , and the exercise of browsing is more about admiring craftsmanship than purchasing .
When I know how a garment is constructed , IÃ¢â¬â¢m better able to tell the difference between an arbitrarily high price and the itemÃ¢â¬â¢s actual value .
Recognizing the high value of superior craftsmanship ensures that I wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be casting off the article as soon as the next seasonÃ¢â¬â¢s ad campaigns launch their full - scale assault .

Addiction , however , is hardy and adaptive .
It has an insatiable appetite , hijacking common sense in order to run rabid .
In the end it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t matter whether the goods are on the internet , hanging on a basement sale rack or are cleverly presented in an architecturally significant building .
The cycle of buying goods then hiding traces of the purchase is the same old DÃÂ©jÃ vu trip no matter how itÃ¢â¬â¢s packaged .

When Gwen Cox raised broiler chickens for Pilgrim âs Pride from 2001 to 2004 , she had to use poultry feed provided by the company .
After a few incidents when she felt physically ill working with it â
â I would start coughing and could hardly stop , or I âd get lightheaded or nauseous , â she remembers â she checked the feed labels and noticed that they listed roxarsone , an organic arsenic compound , as an ingredient .
Concerned about her chickens as well as her own health , she asked Pilgrim âs Pride why she was being forced to use feed containing arsenic .
â I was told to mind my own business , â she says .
â [ They told me ] âit âs a microbe inhibitor and is proven to be safe in the quantity used in the feed . â
But you know some of this stuff is bad when the tickets instruct you not to feed it to any other animals due to it being proven fatal if ingested . â
Pilgrim âs Pride , the second largest chicken company in the country , was nât doing anything uncommon : over 70 percent of all broiler chickens grown in the U.S. are fed roxarsone , according to a 2000 article published in the journal Poultry Science .
Roxarsone prevents the growth of microscopic intestinal parasites called coccidia that frequently infect livestock , and it provides the added bonus of better growth â i.e. , bigger chickens .
( Despite repeated requests , Pilgrim âs Pride would not confirm whether it still uses roxarsone . )
Roxarsone does nât disappear once chickens eat it .
Some is distributed throughout the animal âs tissues , including the breasts , thighs and legs â meat that is later eaten by consumers .
The rest is excreted unchanged in poultry waste .
Ninety percent of this manure is later converted into fertilizer that can contaminate crops , lakes , rivers , and eventually drinking water .
Little research , however , has investigated the public health consequences of this practice , which was banned in the European Union in 1999 .
Although several studies have looked at the levels of arsenic present in chicken muscle meat , and some have looked at crop soil contamination , the results have been inconsistent .
None have determined how extensively this practice contaminates drinking water .
â There âs been such a huge degree of regulatory attention paid to arsenic in drinking water , and yet here âs this very widespread practice that has a real potential of adding to drinking water contamination and yet nobody âs looking at it , â says Dr. David Wallinga , director of the Food and Health Program at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy ( IATP ) , a non-profit research and advocacy organization based in Minneapolis .
Any increase in Americans â levels of arsenic exposure is of great concern :
The Environmental Protection Agency , which regulates drinking water , considers arsenic a class A carcinogen , meaning that data have definitively shown it to cause cancer .
Other health effects from chronic low - level exposure include partial paralysis , blindness and diabetes .
Although the EPA tightened its regulations for arsenic levels in drinking water this past January , lowering it from a maximum of 50 parts per billion ( ppb ) to 10 ppb , this new level still exceeds the agency âs recommendations for exposure to a carcinogen by a factor of 50 .
The EPA typically recommends that the amount of a carcinogen in drinking water should not cause more than one person in 100,000 to develop cancer as a result of drinking that water daily .
But Americans who are regularly drinking water containing 10 ppb of arsenic are at a 50 - fold higher cancer risk than this : in other words , one out of every 2,000 of those Americans is likely to develop cancer because of the arsenic in their tap water .
And the EPA estimates that 12 million Americans are currently drinking water containing more than 10 ppb of arsenic â making their cancer risk even higher .
The EPA is nât meeting its own safety standard for arsenic because the recommended amounts â are set at a level which water systems cannot meet , â according to agency press officer Dale Kemery .
After preparing a cost / benefit analysis , the EPA set its arsenic limits at a level that maximized risk reduction while minimizing cost to the consumer , he says .
Where is all of this arsenic coming from ?
Most arsenic contamination arises from natural sources or from its former use in pesticides and wood preservatives .
Though these uses have since been banned , the arsenic remains in the environment and is extremely difficult to remove .
The poultry industry âs use of roxarsone , however , is one of the few easily preventable ways in which arsenic enters the food chain .
Given that arsenic is already a significant health risk , many think that its use in poultry feed should be investigated and , if found to be a significant source of contamination , banned .

Over the past 15 years , a group of scholars has finally persuaded economists to believe something non-economists find obvious : â behavioural economics â shows that people do not act as economic theory predicts .
However , this is not a vindication of folk wisdom over the pointy - heads .
The deviations from â rational behaviour â were not the wonderful cornucopia of humanist motivations you might imagine .
There were patterns .
We were risk - averse when it came to losses â likely to overestimate chances of loss and underestimate chances of gain , for example .
We rely on heuristics to frame problems but cling to them even when they are contradicted by the facts .
Some of these patterns are endearing ; the supposedly â irrational â concerns for equality that persist in all but Republicans and the economically trained , for example .
But most were simply the mapping of cognitive bias .
We can take advantage of those biases , as those who sell us expensive and irrational warranties on consumer goods do .
Or we can correct for them , like a pilot who is trained to rely on his instruments rather than his faulty perceptions when flying in heavy cloud .
Studying intellectual property and the internet has convinced me that we have another cognitive bias .
Call it the openness aversion .
We are likely to undervalue the importance , viability and productive power of open systems , open networks and non-proprietary production .
Test yourself on the following questions .
In each case , it is 1991 and I have removed from you all knowledge of the past 15 years .
You have to design a global computer network .
One group of scientists describes a system that is fundamentally open â open protocols and systems so anyone could connect to it and offer information or products to the world .
Another group â scholars , businessmen , bureaucrats â points out the problems .
Anyone could connect to it .
They could do anything .
There would be porn , piracy , viruses and spam .
Terrorists could put up videos glorifying themselves .
Your activist neighbour could compete with The New York Times in documenting the Iraq war .
Better to have a well - managed system , in which official approval is required to put up a site ; where only a few actions are permitted ; where most of us are merely recipients of information ; where spam , viruses , piracy ( and innovation and anonymous speech ) are impossible .
Which would you have picked ?
Imagine a form of software that anyone could copy and change , created under a licence that required subsequent programmers to offer their software under the same terms .
Imagine legions of programmers worldwide contributing their creations back into a â commons â .
Is this anarchic - sounding method of production economically viable ?
Could it successfully compete with the hierarchically organised companies producing proprietary , closed code , controlled by both law and technology ?
Set yourself the task of producing the greatest reference work the world has ever seen .
It must cover everything from the best Thai food in Raleigh to the annual rice production of Thailand , the best places to see blue whales to the history of the Blue Dog Coalition .
Would you create a massive organisation of paid experts with layers of editors producing tomes that are controlled by copyright and trademark ?
Or would you wait for hobbyists , scientists and volunteer encyclopedists to produce , and search engines to organise , a cornucopia of information ?
I know which way I would have bet in 1991 .
But I also know that the last time I consulted an encyclopedia was in 1998 .
It is not that openness is always right .
Rather , it is that we need a balance between open and closed , owned and free , and we are systematically likely to get the balance wrong .
Partly this is because we still do not understand the kind of property that exists on networks .
Most of our experience is with tangible property ; fields that can be overgrazed if outsiders cannot be excluded .
For that kind of property , control makes more sense .
We still do not intuitively grasp the kind of property that cannot be exhausted by overuse ( think of a piece of software ) and that can become more valuable to us the more it is used by others ( think of a communications standard ) .
There the threats are different , but so are the opportunities for productive sharing .
Our intuitions , policies and business models misidentify both .
Like astronauts brought up in gravity , our reflexes are poorly suited for free fall .
The questions I asked are related to the world wide web â which celebrated its 15th birthday last year .
Would we create it today ?
In 1991 , you would have scoffed at the web , at open - source software and at getting your information from Google .
Control and ownership seem intuitively the right way to go .
How do you feel about today âs debates ?
Should we preserve â net neutrality â and openness or give network owners greater control ?
Should we create new rights for broadcasters and database owners ?
The next project of the behavioural economists should be to study our cognitive frameworks about property , control and networks .
Like the pilot in the cloud looking at his instruments , we might learn that we are upside down .

One of the most common fallacies about scientific research is that the validity of a study can be determined by the date it was done .
â Outdated â studies are not to be trusted , we âre often led to believe .
It âs sort of the junk scientists â version of numerology .
Sadly , when we become convinced to dismiss studies out - of - hand because of some measure other than the strength of the science itself , we make ourselves vulnerable to being taken advantage of by unsound ideas and to miss out on the best available science ...

MATHEMATICALLY confident drivers stuck in the usual jam on highway 101 through Silicon Valley were recently able to pass time contemplating a billboard that read : â { first 10 - digit prime found in consecutive digits of e}.com . â
The number in question , 7427466391 , is a sequence that starts at the 101st digit of e , a constant that is the base of the natural logarithm .
The select few who worked this out and made it to the right website then encountered a â harder â riddle .
Solving it led to another web page where they were finally invited to submit their curriculum vitae .
If a billboard can capture the soul of a company , this one did , because the anonymous advertiser was Google , whose main product is the world 's most popular internet search engine .
With its presumptuous humour , its mathematical obsessions , its easy , arrogant belief that it is the natural home for geniuses , the billboard spoke of a company that thinks it has taken its rightful place as the leader of the technology industry , a position occupied for the past 15 years by Microsoft .
In tone , the billboard was â googley â , as the firm 's employees like to say .
That adjective , says one spokeswoman , evokes a â humble , cosmopolitan , different , toned - down â classiness .
A good demonstration of googley - ness came in the speeches at a conference in Las Vegas this year .
Whereas the bosses of other technology companies welcomed the audience into the auditorium with flashing lights and blasting rock music , Google played Bach 's Brandenburg Concerto Number
Three and had a thought puzzle waiting on every seat .
The billboard was also googley in that , like Google 's home page , it had visual simplicity that belied the sophistication of its content .
To outsiders , however , googley - ness often implies audacious ambition , a missionary calling to improve the world and the equation of nerdiness with virtue .
The main symptom of this , prominently displayed on the billboard , is a deification of mathematics .
Google constantly leaves numerical puns and riddles for those who care to look in the right places .
When it filed the regulatory documents for its stockmarket listing in 2004 , it said that it planned to raise $ 2,718,281,828 , which is $e billion to the nearest dollar .
A year later , it filed again to sell another batch of shares â precisely 14,159,265 , which represents the first eight digits after the decimal in the number pi ( 3.14159265 ) .
The mathematics comes from the founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
The Russian - born Mr Brin is the son of a professor of statistics and probability and a mother who works at NASA ; Mr Page is the son of two computer - science teachers .
The breakthrough that made their search engine so popular was the realisation that the chaos of the internet had an implicit mathematical order .
By counting , weighting and calculating the link structures between web pages , Messrs Page and Brin were able to return search results more relevant than those of any other search engine .
So far , they have maintained this superiority .
Danny Sullivan , the editor of Search Engine Watch , an online industry newsletter , ranks Google as the best search engine , Yahoo ! as second - best , Ask ( the re-named Ask Jeeves ) third , and Microsoft 's MSN last among the big four .
Google 's share of searches has gone up almost every month of the past year .
Including those on AOL , an internet portal that uses Google 's search technology , Google had half of all searches in March .
Excluding AOL , the figure was 43 % .
This is why people â google â â rather than , say , â yahoo â â their driving directions , dates and recipes .
Mathematical prowess is also behind the other half of Google 's success : its ability to turn all those searches into money .
Unlike software companies such as Microsoft which get most of their revenues from licence fees , Google is primarily an advertising agency .
It does not sell the usual sort of advertising , in which an advertiser places a display on a page and pays per thousand visitor â impressions â ( views ) : it has perfected the more efficient genre of â pay - per- click â advertising .
It places little text advertisements ( â sponsored links â ) on a page in an order determined by auction among the advertisers .
But these advertisers pay only once an internet user actually clicks on their links ( thereby expressing an interest in buying ) .
This works best on the pages of search results , which account for over half of the firm 's revenues , because the users ' keywords allow Google to place relevant advertisements on the page .
But it also works on other web pages , such as blogs or newspaper articles , that sign up to be part of Google 's â network â .
The world brain
These two interlocking â engines â â the search algorithms coupled with the advertising algorithms â are the motor that powers Google 's growth in revenues ( $ 6.1 billion last year ) and profits ( $ 1.5 billion ) , as well as its $ 117 billion market capitalisation .
Its horsepower is the reason why Andy Bechtolsheim , Google 's first investor ( as well as a co-founder of Sun Microsystems , a big computer - maker ) still holds on to all his shares in the firm .
It 's all about advertisers â bidding up the keywords â in Google 's auctions , he says .
â How far this thing could go , nobody can say . â
Since its stockmarket debut , however , Google has been adding new and often quite different products to this twin engine .
It now owns Picasa , which makes software to edit digital photos on computers ; Orkut , a social - networking site popular mainly in Brazil ; and Blogger , which lets people start an online journal .
It also offers free software for instant - messaging and internet telephony , for searching on the desktop computers of users , for ( virtually ) flying around the Earth , for keeping computers free of viruses , for uploading and sharing videos , and for creating web pages .
It has a free e-mail program and calendar .
It recently bought a firm called Writely , which lets people create and save text documents ( much as Microsoft 's Word does ) online rather than on their own computers .
Google is also scanning books in several large libraries to make them searchable .
It is preparing to offer free wireless internet access in San Francisco and perhaps other cities , and dabbling in radio advertising .
And that is only the start of a long list .
Whether these are arbitrary distractions or not depends on one 's point of view .
For Messrs Brin and Page , they make mathematical sense .
Mr Brin ( â the strategy guy â ) has calculated that Google 's engineers should spend 70 % of their time on core products ( ie , the search and advertising engines ) , 20 % on relevant but tangential products , and 10 % on wild fun that might or might not lead to a product .
The result is that lots of tiny teams are working on all sorts of projects , the most promising ones of which end up on the prestigious â top 100 â list that Mr Page ( â the product guy â ) spends a lot of his time on .
Most of the items on that list in theory have something to do with Google 's mission , which is â to organise the world 's information â .
Scanning and indexing books , for instance , brings offline information online .
The outside world increasingly sees it differently .
Among Google fans , the company has come to epitomise the more mature ( ie , post - bust ) internet generation , which goes by the marketing clichÃ© â Web 2.0 â ( see article ) .
In this context , it is assumed to be working on absolutely everything simultaneously , and every new product announcement , no matter how trivial , is greeted as a tiny step toward an eventual world - changing transformation .
At a minimum , this hypothetical transformation would consist of moving computation and data off people 's personal computers and on to the network â ie , Google 's servers .
Other names for this scenario are the â GDrive â or the â Google grid â that the company is allegedly working on , meaning free ( but ultimately advertising - supported ) copious online storage and possibly free internet access .
Free storage threatens Microsoft , because its software dominates personal computers rather than the internet ; free access threatens other internet - access providers .
At a maximum , the transformation goes quite a bit further .
George Dyson , a futurist who has spent time at Google , thinks that the company ultimately intends to link all these digital synapses created by its users into what H.G. Wells , a British science - fiction writer , once called the â world brain â .
Google , Mr Dyson thinks , wants to fulfil the geeks ' dream of creating â artificial intelligence â .
Passing the so - called â Turing test â , created by Alan Turing , a British mathematician , to determine whether a machine can be said to be able to think , would be the ultimate reward .
From primes to share prices
But many who deal with Google in their daily lives are getting fed up with such grandiose notions .
Google 's shares , after nearly quintupling since they began trading , have fallen in recent months .
Pip Coburn , an investment strategist , says that â Google was a simple story at one point : online ads on top of the most popular search mechanism on the planet .
Simple .
But now it is pretty much a mess and to get the stock going again , the company may need to work on its own simplicity so as to match the simplicity of the Google home page itself . â
Mr Sullivan of Search Engine Watch says Google has become distracted .
â Oh , give me a break , â he wrote in his blog after yet another product announcement .
â A break from Google going in yet another direction when there is so much stuff they have n't finished , gotten right or need to fix . â
He points to a rule in Google 's corporate philosophy that â it 's best to do one thing really , really well , â and suggests that the company is â doing 100 different things rather than one thing really , really well . â
Google is thus starting to look a bit as Microsoft did a decade ago , with one strength ( Windows for Microsoft , search for Google ) and a string of mediocre â me - too â products .
Google Video , for instance , was supposed to become an online marketplace for video clips , both personal and business , but has been overtaken by YouTube , a start - up that is a few months old but already has four times as much video traffic .
Google News , where the stories are , characteristically , chosen by mathematical algorithms rather than by editors , perennially lags behind Yahoo !
News , with its old - fashioned human touch .
Google 's instant - messaging software is tiny compared with AOL's , Yahoo ! 's and MSN's .
Google is beginning to resemble the old Microsoft in another way , too .
A decade ago , Microsoft stood accused of stifling innovation , because entrepreneurs would stay away from any area of technology in which it showed any interest .
Google , whose slogan is â Do n't be evil â , hates this comparison and wants to think of itself as ventilating rather than stifling the ecosystem of developers and entrepreneurs .
â I do n't see how they can say that , â says an entrepreneur and competitor who is too afraid of unspecified consequences to speak on the record .
Like most of Silicon Valley these days , he finds Google 's slogan ridiculous , because â we 're not evil either , we just do n't go around saying it . â
Entrepreneurs like him are getting annoyed by Google 's seemingly endless â betas â , also known as â technical previews â , when new products are not yet officially launched but available , ostensibly for testing and review .
Traditionally , beta reviews were meant to last weeks or months and were targeted at testers who would find and report bugs .
Google seems to use betas as dogs sprinkle trees â so that rivals know where it is .
Google News recently graduated out of its beta after about four years .
In fairness , Google 's role today is more complex than Microsoft 's was in the 1990s , when start - ups often hoped to â exit â by listing their shares on the stockmarket , and were occasionally expunged by Microsoft before they got there .
Today , start - ups ( such as Writely , Picasa , Orkut and Urchin ) often use Google ( or the other internet titans ) as the exit , selling themselves to the big guy .
It works for individuals too .
Paul Rademacher is a software engineer who last year came up with a clever way of combining Google 's interactive maps with other websites .
Google hired him .
To Google 's initial surprise and subsequent chagrin ( is it not enough to vow never to be evil ? ) , it alienates more groups of people as it enters more areas of modern life .
It appeared to be genuinely taken aback that some book publishers oppose its plan to scan their books and make them searchable .
Google also seemed surprised when privacy advocates voiced concerns over its practice of placing advertisements in contextually related e-mail messages on its webmail service , and again this year when it announced a Chinese version that censors the search results .
Slowly , the company is realising that it is so important that it may not be able to control the ramifications of its own actions .
â As more and more data builds up in the company 's disk farms , â says Edward Felten , an expert on computer privacy at Princeton University , â the temptation to be evil only increases .
Even if the company itself stays non-evil , its data trove will be a massive temptation for others to do evil . â
In a world of rogue employees , intruders and accidents , he says , Google could be â one or two privacy disasters away from becoming just another internet company â .
Such concerns are forcing Messrs Brin and Page , still in their early 30s , and Eric Schmidt , whom they hired as chief executive and who is in his early 50s , to behave increasingly like a â normal â company .
Google recently sent its first lobbyists to Washington , DC .
Its decision to build an â evil scale â to help it devise its China strategy was more unusual , but its hiring of Al Gore , a former American vice - president , to aid the process , was just the kind of thing that old - fashioned empire - building firms do all the time .
Other companies are reacting in traditional ways to Google 's dominance .
Former rivals , such as eBay , Yahoo ! and Microsoft , are exploring alliances to counter its influence .
When Microsoft tried to buy AOL from its parent , Time Warner , Google 's Mr Schmidt flew in for talks that led to Google taking a defensive stake in AOL , thus keeping it out of Microsoft 's and Yahoo ! 's reach .
In response , Microsoft has contemplated buying all or part of Yahoo ! , and has recently announced a vague but large increase in research spending which amounts to an arms race .
Google is now alleging that Microsoft is unfairly steering users of its web browser to MSN for searches , and is preparing to dispatch lawyers to keep Microsoft in check .
Google thus finds itself at a defining moment .
There are plenty of people within the company who want it to play the power game .
â The folks who are closest to Larry and Sergey are very , very worried about Microsoft , as well they should be , â says John Battelle , the author of a blog and a book on Google .
Yet the company 's founders themselves may not be prepared to drop their idealism and their faith in their own mathematical genius .
They have always wanted to succeed by being good and doing good .
â Never once did we consider buying a big company , â says David Krane , Google 's 84th employee , by way of example .
It would not be googley .
It would , he says , be â yuck â .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Plug in the words " India " and " superpower " into an Internet search engine and it's happy to oblige - with 1.3 million hits .
I confess that I did not check each one , but I suspect that almost all of these entries date from the last couple of years .
This is understandable .
For the first time ever , India has posted four straight years of 8 percent growth ; since it cracked open its economy in 1991 , it has averaged growth of 6 percent a year - not in the same league as China , but twice the derisory " Hindu rate of growth " that had marked the first 45 years of independence .
India has gone nuclear , and even gotten the United States to accept that status .
Its movies are crossing over to become international hits .
The recent $ 11.3 billion takeover of Corus by Mumbai - based Tata Steel was the biggest acquisition ever by an Indian firm .
No wonder the idea of India as the next superpower is fast becoming conventional wisdom .
" Our Time is Now , " asserts The Times of India .
And in an October survey by the Chicago Council on World Affairs , Indians said they saw their country as the second most influential in the world .
Sorry : India is not a superpower , and in fact , that is probably the wrong ambition for it , anyway .
Why ?
Let me answer in the form of some statistics .
47 percent of Indian children under the age of five are either malnourished or stunted .
The adult literacy rate is 61 percent ( behind Rwanda and barely ahead of Sudan ) .
Even this is probably overstated , as people are deemed literate who can do little more than sign their name .
Only 10 percent of the entire Indian labor force works in the formal economy ; of these fewer than half are in the private sector .
The enrollment of six - to - 15 - year - olds in school has actually declined in the last year .
About 40 million children who are supposed to be in school are not .
About a fifth of the population is chronically hungry ; about half of the world 's hungry live in India .
More than a quarter of the India population lives on less than a dollar a day .
India has more people with HIV than any other country .
( Sources : UNDP , Unicef , World Food Program ; Edward Luce )
You get the idea .
The 2006 UN Human Development Report , which ranks countries according to a variety of measures of human health and welfare , placed India 126th out of 177 countries .
India was only a few places ahead of rival Pakistan ( 134th ) and hapless Cambodia ( 129 ) and behind such not - about - to - be- superpowers as Equatorial Guinea ( 120 ) , and Tajikistan ( 122 ) .
As these and other numbers suggest , Indian triumphalism ( a notable 126,000 hits on Google ) is not only premature , it is misguided .
Yes , growth has been brisk , and of course growth is necessary to make a dent in poverty .
But as Edward Luce , author of the excellent , " In Spite of the Gods : The Strange Rise of Modern India , " noted in a recent talk , poverty in India is not falling nearly as fast as its brisk rate of growth might anticipate .
The reason for this is that Indian growth has been capital - intensive , driven by the growth in high - value services such as IT .
This is a good thing , but what it does not do is create stable and reasonably paid employment for not particularly skilled people - and this matters a lot , considering eight to 10 million Indians enter the labor force every year .
Luce estimates that there are 7 million Indians working in the formal manufacturing sector in India - and 100 million in China .
To look at it another way , the 1 million Indians working in IT account for less than one - half of one percent of the entire working population .
This helps build reserves ( and national confidence , and tax revenues ) but is not the poverty buster that labor - intensive development is .
As Prime Minister Singh told Luce , " Our biggest single problem is the lack of jobs for ordinary people . "
The problem with India 's self - proclaimed ( and wildly premature ) declaration of superpower status is that it reflects a complacency about both its present - which for many people is dire - and its future .
Eight percent growth for four years is wonderful , but as the saying goes , past performance is no guarantee of future results .
And India is not doing what it needs to in order to sustain this momentum .
Consider the postwar history of East and Southeast Asia .
The comparison is appropriate because India started at about the same point , and has watched just about every country in the region get ahead of it on the economic curve .
All these places developed by being relatively open to trade ; by investing in primary and secondary education ; and by building pretty decent infrastructure ( not only roads and ports , but health clinics and water supplies ) .
India has begun to embrace one leg of this triangle - freer trade .
Even here , though , many of the worst features of the swadeshi ( " self - reliance " ) era remain intact , including an unreformed state banking sector ; labor regulations that actively discourage hiring ; abstruse land laws ( and consequent lack of land titles ) ; misshapen subsidies that hurt the poor ; and corruption that is broad , deep and ubiquitous .
Nothing useful is being done about any of this .
As for the other two legs of this development triangle - education and infrastructure - these are still badly broken .
About a third of teachers fail to show up on any given day ( and , of course , are unsackable ) ; the supply of both water and power is expensive and unreliable .
These facts of life too often go unremarked in the current euphoria about the state of the nation .
" We no longer discuss the future of India , " Commerce Minister Kamal Nath told the Financial Times in a typical comment .
" The future is India . "
Hubris , of course , is the stuff of politics everywhere .
But the future will not belong to India unless it takes action to embrace it , and that means more than high - profile vanity projects like putting a man on the moon or building the worldï¿½s tallest tower .
It means showing that the world 's largest democracy can deliver real progress to the hundreds of millions who have never used the phone , much less the Internet .
And in important ways , that just is n't happening .
India has many reasons to be proud , but considering it remains a world leader in hunger , stunting and HIV , its waxing self - satisfaction seems sadly beside the point .

DOT - COM ON THE CHEAP / Startups shun forebears ' excesses , and some workers even bring their own chairs

It took backbone to launch a new company six years ago amid the mounting wreckage of the technology bust .
With no venture capital funding , Jay Borenstein and his fellow founders of Palo Alto 's Integration Appliance Inc. knew they would have to stretch every dollar .
So they came up with a " bring your own chair " hiring policy .
New employees might have developed poor posture , but they also learned the company 's Spartan mind - set .
" It was kind of a litmus test for people who were thinking about joining us , " said Borenstein , Integration Appliance 's CEO .
Gone are the Herman Miller Aeron desk chairs and the other technocrat excesses of the late 1990s when dot - coms burned through money and hype , throwing lavish launch parties , staffing up quickly and spending millions on Super Bowl ads .
Emerging in their stead is a post - crash generation of stingy startups using ingenuity to minimize the cost of turning raw ideas into viable businesses .
They hire slowly and avoid using recruiters .
They take advantage of plunging technology prices .
They generate buzz by word of mouth .
They establish overseas operations to lower labor costs .
They scrounge computers and furniture from the free section of community Web site Craigslist .
And , when they raise venture capital , they hoard it , fearful of blowing their shot at making it .
Statistics bear out this trend .
Bay Area startups are raising less money these days -- an average of $ 8 million a pop , down from $ 11 million in 2000 , according to research firm VentureOne .
And they are making the money last longer , an average of 17 months , up from 10 months in 2000 .
" Startups today just hole themselves away to code and code and code , " said Jessica Livingston , co-founder of startup venture firm Y Combinator and author of a new book , " Founders at Work : Stories of Startups ' Early Days . "
" They spend money where it matters , but nothing in excess .
They know that no matter how much they raise , be it $ 100,000 or $ 10 million , this is not funny money .
It 's what 's keeping them alive .
...
It 's much more important to them to focus on getting users and building a product that people want . "
That nouveau parsimony means this technology boom may have a softer landing than the last , when dot - coms went from flush to flat broke faster than a high - speed connection could download " Who Let the Dogs Out " and left hundreds of companies out of business and thousands of people out of work .
Many startups will fail this time around , too .
But with thriftier spending habits , they will last longer than their dot - com forebears .
" One of the sharpest differences between 1999 and 2000 and now is the lack of excess spending across the board , " said San Francisco venture capitalist Peter Thiel .
Take Munjal Shah , who raised $ 60 million for his first company .
He has barely touched the $ 19 million he raised for online shopping service Like.com , which his company Riya launched a few months ago .
More than half of Shah 's employees work out of an office in Bangalore , and he pays a significant percentage of the rent for his San Mateo office with stock .
He hired all but one of his employees from the social networking site LinkedIn , Craigslist and technology blogs .
And , instead of throwing a splashy launch party in November 2005 , Riya bought $ 2,000 worth of pizza and beer for a lower - key bash in the leafy backyard of TechCrunch blogger Michael Arrington 's Atherton home .
Perhaps most important , Shah created sophisticated technology -- a program that searches Web images for goods on a shopper 's wish list -- on a shoestring startup budget , a path that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
No expense is too small to escape scrutiny in this ascetic age .
" Someone said the other day , ' Let 's get T - shirts . '
And I said , ' You know , let 's not , ' " Shah said .
San Francisco entrepreneur James Currier welcomes the revival of the old - school Silicon Valley ethos , scrappy garage - dwellers cranking out revolutionary ideas in cramped quarters .
Currier started Tickle -- the Internet company he sold in 2004 for $ 100 million to Monster.com -- in a dank , drafty basement in Cambridge , Mass. , with a computer server perched on bricks to stay dry during rainstorms .
After moving to San Francisco , Currier rented offices in the Tenderloin that were cushy by comparison .
There his employees used old oak doors salvaged from a demolished apartment building as desks .
Currier said the hardened neighborhood made it easy during job interviews -- conducted over a no - frills $ 5 lunch at the nearby Vietnamese hole - in - the - wall Tu Lan -- to sort the believers from the opportunists .
" Starting a business is an adventure .
It can build your character as you build the business in that Joseph Campbell ' The Hero With a Thousand Faces ' kind of way , " Currier said .
" Having an austere environment helps get your team into that mind - set . "
That mind - set is in full force at meebo Inc. in Mountain View .
In September 2005 , Seth Sternberg , Elaine Wherry and Sandy Jen used their credit cards to fire up the instant messaging service .
Ever since , they have grown the business cautiously , spending about $ 160,000 a month on the 12 - employee operation .
Meebo , which raised $ 3.5 million in venture funding in December 2005 , announced that it has raised another $ 9 million this week as its registered users doubled to more than 1 million .
Despite its early success , meebo remains miserly .
The holiday party consisted of chips and soda served up in the company parking lot .
But meebo gets some of the biggest bang from not spending its bucks .
In another sign of the increasingly collective nature of the Internet , the company has deputized fiercely loyal users to find and fix bugs in the software , answer each other 's questions in a help forum , and identify and delete spam .
This significantly reduces day - to - day business costs and frees up meebo employees to focus on the big picture .
Users even help create new features .
They set up a group
Web page to translate meebo into 69 languages , including Creole , Swahili , pig Latin , Klingon , " Bork Bork Bork ! " ( the Swedish Chef language from the Muppets ) and Leet ( online gaming slang ) .
" This is way better than the stuff we could have ever paid for , " Sternberg said .
That cross between inventiveness and frugality is becoming as cultish as the iconic dot - com sock puppet .
The only thing conspicuous about San Francisco startup Rapleaf is the lack of consumption , even of something as basic as square footage .
Founder Auren Hoffman squeezes his seven - person posse into 1,800 square feet he splits down the middle with another startup .
For his share of the South of Market digs , he pays about $ 1,500 a month in rent , a San Francisco real estate bargain .
He did not even spring for a sign on the office door because the landlord charges $ 230 a pop .
" It 's a different take on being stealth , " Hoffman said .
Roy de Souza , founder and CEO of Zedo Inc. , also shares inexpensive offices with two other startups , upstairs from a " spa " that had been shuttered after being raided by federal agents .
Penny - pinching is a bit incongruous for the San Francisco Internet and advertising company that runs Zebo.com , a Web site devoted to young people making lists of all the possessions and brand names they have or want .
But de Souza credits that frugal guiding spirit with keeping the 7 - year - old Zedo afloat when the dot - com bubble burst .
De Souza relies on friends for everything from business leads to free furniture .
He hires college interns who need experience more than money .
" You want to invest in the technology and the product , not in furniture and white boards , " de Souza said .
No one boasts more frugal beginnings than Xuqa , the popular online game .
Like the game 's players who collect credits called " peanuts , " Ali Moiz , Murtaza Hussain and Prosper Nwankpa started their business with not much more .
Moiz and Hussain were students and Nwankpa had just graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts in spring 2005 when they began .
Their first server was cobbled together from spare parts stripped from old equipment in the campus computer center , where they built a site secretly hosted on the college 's fast Internet connection .
They raised money to buy new servers by trading dining hall meals back to the college for cash .
Often sleeping in the computer center , they brought in pillows and blankets on chilly winter nights .
Campus police even mistook them for homeless people one morning and almost threw them out .
A year ago , they put their college education on hold to move to San Francisco , where they bunk together in a two - bedroom apartment , subsisting on a fast - food diet .
They squatted in their venture firm 's offices until the investors gave them more money to find their own office .
They keep a lid on expenses by maintaining an office in Karachi , Pakistan , where most of their employees work .
" We keep the company lean and mean , " Hussain said .
Borenstein credits thrifty startup policies , such as bringing your own chair , with Integration Appliance 's success .
For months , Borenstein parked himself in an ergonomic nightmare , a family hand - me - down with a lumpy , foam - shedding cushion that he could n't stand for more than a few hours at a time .
Another chair was nicknamed " the back - stabber . "
They scavenged old printers and fax machines from their lawyers and customers , and played to determine who would get a voice mail box on the company 's $ 14.99 answering machine from Fry's .
A " recycling mound " in the middle of the office provided old parts employees could use to patch computers or build new ones .
Today , Integration Appliance is profitable , with 50 employees , steady revenue and 20 Fortune 500 customers from Citigroup to Chiron .
Borenstein may have a more comfortable chair , but he holds firm to his cautious way of spending and thinking .
" If you have an idea you really believe in , " he said , " you 're willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that overhead and expenses do n't get in the way . "

Bono and his wife , Ali Hewson , have been traveling the globe endorsing their new clothing line , Edun .
This clothing line promises to create Fair Tradeâlike principles which respect the workers who make the clothes and pass on the workers ' story .
As Ali Hewson says with an interjection from Bono , " It 's making people aware of the story of clothes â¦ do you really want to put on something that 's made â with despair . " [ 1 ]
Bono promises to have decent working conditions and to abstain from employing child labor .
According to the factory manager in Lesotho , Thabang Kholumo , the wages paid are 600 rand ( currently $ 87.68 ) a month .
This is a little over 50 cents an hour assuming a 40 - hour work week .
Surely these are twice that of other factories in the area ?
Not so .
The country of Lesotho has minimum - wage laws by profession .
According to a report highlighting current labor market conditions in Lesotho on the Global Policy Network website , [ 2 ] the minimum wage for trained sewing machine operators is 650 maloti ( $ 94.80 ) a month . [ 3 ]
Unless there were specific fluctuations in the currency price at the time of Thabang Kholumo 's information , Bono would have been paying below the minimum wage allotted for textile workers .
In any event , he does n't seem to be paying more than the required minimum .
Contrary to the ethos that Bono has been promoting , this is not a bad thing .
To put a floor on wages is to enforce two conditions that would be unfortunate for workers : first , it means that the least skilled cannot be employed because their productive contribution to the firm falls beneath the minimum ; second , it means that few people in general can be employed , which denies opportunities to people .
This further does not explain the fractional share of profits that workers receive .
Thabang Kholumo reveals that 125 female employees make 3,000 items a day .
These items retail for $ 50 - $ 300 !
A pair of Edun jeans will cost you a pricey $ 275 .
You can do the math for yourself .
One pair of jeans $ 275 and one month of work $ 87.68 in Bono 's " sweatshop . "
According to Bono 's mistaken economic theories , he is no champion of the poor in his own factory .
These wages are incompatible with the message Bono and Ali are trying to portray .
Bono speaks about creating a new business model that can be emulated by other companies .
In fact , he is doing what others are doing and have done for a very long time , and it is good for everyone .
Bono also boasts of not employing child labor .
Well of course you would n't use child labor Bono , because Lesotho has minimum - age - for - employment laws setting the working age in the industrial sector at 15 .
Further , the Labor Code sets regulations on working conditions .
According to the US Department of State 's 2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices , the working conditions are not that onerous .
They say , " The Labor Code requires employers to provide adequate light , ventilation , and sanitary facilities for employees and to install and maintain machinery in a manner to minimize risk of injury ; employers generally followed these regulations . "
Further , " labor inspectors generally conducted unannounced inspections in factories four times a year . "
Bono is simply following Lesotho laws , but no more .
Big deal .
But there is not much difference between Bono's " sweatshops " and others .
The only thing revolutionary about Bono 's business plan is not the way workers are treated but the way in which they are cleverly marketed to the public .
Edun 's website says :
In 1980 Africa had a 6 % share of world trade .
By 2002 this had dropped to just 2 % despite the fact that Africa has 12 % of the world 's population .
If Africa could regain just an additional 1 % share of global trade , it would earn $ 70 billion more in exports each year - more than three times what the region currently receives in international assistance .
If in addition , all countries in East Asia , South Asia and Latin America were each to increase their share of world exports by 1 % , the resulting gains in income could lift 128 million people out of poverty .
Freer trade would certainly be a tremendous benefit to Africa .
What is forgotten , however , is that free trade is exactly what leftist anti-sweatshop activists like Bono are against !
The truth is that Bono is doing something admirable just like Nike has been for a long time .
Any factory that opens in an area with low employment benefits the population .
Competition for labor eventually lifts wages as we have seen in Industrial Revolution Europe , South Korea , Taiwan , and many other places during many other times .
Capital investment and competition for labor by American multinational corporations has for decades caused wages and living standards to rise in underdeveloped countries like Lesotho .
Indeed , the mere fact that people seek such jobs is proof that they believe that their living standard will improve by doing so .
Bono may be paying below - minimum wages today , but that will not last as the productivity of his employees improves .
One thing that would speed up this process is even more foreign " sweatshop " investment , which would stimulate competition for Lesotho 's labor force even more .
Countries like Lesotho need more sweatshops , not fewer .
Perhaps Bono can persuade some of his multimillionaire entertainment industry friends to invest with him .
To say that Bono 's factory is something special would not be truthful .
The Edun clothing line is doing well , and is employing hundreds of people .
That 's great .
It 's called capitalism .

It is pegged to the South African rand on a 1:1 basis through the Common Monetary Area , and both are accepted as legal tender within Lesotho . "

( integral from 10 to 13 ) ( 2xdx ) = what I did with your mom last night !
Scrawled on the wall of a toilet stall in my local math department :
With quill in hand , Rabbi Menachem Youlus scrutinizes his latest treasure â a centuries - old Torah , stabbed and burned by Nazis during World War II .
Many of the onyx - colored Hebrew letters of the scroll are so damaged they now appear to float like rafts on a sea of tea-colored parchment .
The Torah scribe will painstakingly retrace the letters â 300,000 of them â reapplying the ink six times on each letter to preserve the original penmanship .
It 's a quietly tense job he performs .
A single mistake on the battered but sacred scroll could render the entire Torah pasul , or unfit .
His labors in the sanctuary of his workroom might be considered the easy part of Rabbi Youlus 's specialty of Torah restoration .
But before he can restore , he must locate and unearth the scrolls .
And therein lies the very unlikely cloak - and - dagger lifestyle of the unassuming , sparkling - eyed man with the deft fingers of a surgeon .
Thousands of Torahs lie buried or hidden wherever Jews have been persecuted â from Eastern Europe to the former Soviet Union .
Many other Torahs have found their way into hostile hands â such as Baghdad 's Saddam Hussein - era National Museum .
Part Indiana Jones and part Sherlock Holmes , scribe Youlus travels the world following leads on sacred scrolls , brokering secret deals for them , smuggling them in ingenious fashion across hostile borders , and even digging in the earth for them .
In arranging an interview for this article , the scholar - sleuth had to cut the call short because he was due to meet an ex-KGB general at Exit 11 on the Jersey Turnpike .
The former Soviet spy hoped to cut a deal for hundreds of Torahs ; to prove he had the Torahs , he mailed Youlus a piece of parchment torn from one of them .
" The Torah is different from other artifacts .
Seventy years from now we will not see a Holocaust survivor , " says Youlus .
" Having these Torahs will make it more real for people than just reading about the Holocaust ; the Torah is tangible . "
***
Youlus embarked on his mission more than 20 years ago .
One Friday night , a car struck his father and brother - in - law as they were walking to synagogue .
They were n't expected to live .
The young rabbi prayed .
He promised to devote the first year of his marriage to the Torah if they survived .
Today the pair work alongside Youlus .
The time came to fulfill his vow .
After studying in Israel , Youlus completed his training in Leningrad , Russia .
Today the rabbi â who speaks Polish , Hungarian , Russian , and Yiddish , plus a dollop of Spanish â works with antiquities departments worldwide .
He has rescued 523 Torahs , many of which come from places the Holocaust completely obliterated .
Often a town 's sole survivor is the Torah .
That 's how his current project â the Nazi - damaged , 228 - year - old scroll â found its way into his workshop at the Jewish Book Store of Greater Washington ( D.C. ) .
The Torah comes from Breznice , Czechoslovakia , where 200 Jews once lived .
When the Third Reich thundered into town , only 30 remained .
The Nazis confiscated all Jewish property and dispatched the Torahs to Prague to be displayed as relics of an extinct people .
Unlike Breznice 's Jews , the Torahs survived .
A generation later and a continent away , Adam and Monica Chusid , of Westport , Conn. lost their 13 - month - old daughter , Rebecca , in 1994 .
Gripped with sorrow , the Chusids yearned to heal .
" We searched to find something that would honor her memory and link her memory with our other children , " said Mr. Chusid , father of Hannah , now 16 , and Rebecca 's twin , Jenna , now 13 .
Chusid hoped to save a Holocaust era scroll .
Through the London - based Westminster Synagogue , Chusid located the Breznice scroll , which he was able to get put on permanent loan to The Conservative Synagogue in Westport .
It will remain in Maryland until Youlus finishes repairing the Nazi damage .
It keeps company with scores of Torahs , stacked floor to ceiling , awaiting the ministrations of the scribe .
The Torah , written in Hebrew , contains the Old Testament .
For Jews the Torah transcends theology and law ; it embodies Judaism 's soul .
For that reason there have been those from the Spanish Inquisition to Stalinist Russia who have sought its destruction .
It 's a visceral feeling Youlus recalls when once , in the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad , he stood before one of the oldest known versions of the Talmud .
" All I wanted to do was break the case and rescue this work from a regime not known for treating Jews very well , " he says .
Hussein considered Torahs talismans and ordered hundreds of Iraqi scrolls defiled .
Youlus hopes to someday save these Iraqi Torahs .
According to Jewish law , damaged Torahs , unless repaired , must be buried .
Thus the Westport scroll must be restored , explains Rabbi Robert Tobin of The Conservative Synagogue .
" If we bury that Torah scroll we will lose the last living thing from that community , " he says .
" Rabbi Youlus may be the only person who can save the scroll , " says Rabbi Tobin .
Some argue that preserving these scrolls intact , keeping their scars from Nazi bayonets and Jewish blood , can refute Holocaust deniers .
But for people like Chusid , " putting them in display cases is not much better than what the Nazis intended .
It makes the scrolls relics . "
***
Youlus 's Save A Torah Foundation retains 27 scribes and 20 spotters who help find endangered scrolls .
The spotters may be Jewish , Roman Catholic , or Muslim ; they may be priests , diplomats , or curators .
Once Youlus locates a Torah , he brings it back to the US to assess damage with digital cameras and infrared scanners .
The Torahs can cost between $ 8,000 and $ 12,000 and are then resold to carefully screened communities for between $ 12,000 and $ 20,000 .
Youlus earns nothing from this work and , in fact , has gone into debt .
In the beginning he faced many hurdles : " I did n't know the laws for getting Torahs out of countries .
I made too many unscrupulous contacts . "
He has disassembled a Torah into 62 panels to conceal it in a false - bottomed suitcase .
He once even " wrapped a Torah around my body and hid it under a trench coat to get it out of Iran , " he says .
Recounting his experiences with all the calm of reciting a grocery list , he says , " I once spent a night in a Soviet prison .
I was beaten up in Germany and lost two front teeth .
I was once knocked out . "
Many governments , including Russia , have nationalized their Torahs .
This riles Youlus : " They have no more Jews , but they 're still keeping our property â our cultural property . "
Several years ago , he had his most startling discovery .
In Kamenets - Poldoski , Ukraine , a farmer approached Youlus , staring at his yarmulke .
The farmer offered him a map for $ 1,500 .
His father had instructed him to sell it to the first Jew he met .
Like a child 's treasure map , an X marked the spot .
Tiny pictures of shoes showed how many " boots " it took to get to the spot .
Ivan , Youlus 's bodyguard , looked wary .
" But my gut told me something was there , " recalls Youlus .
" I paid him and climbed into his wooden cart .
It was an old cart with an older horse . "
Ivan ran behind .
Then , Youlus says , a farmer told him that " we have to own the land to dig .
So we pay .
Ivan digs like there 's no tomorrow , because our plane is [ leaving ] in less than three hours .
We hit upon something . "
Two Torah scrolls lay nestled among 260 sets of bones that belonged to Jewish children slaughtered in the Holocaust .
Unable to identify the remains , Youlus 's father suggested that words from psalms grace each headstone .
Since Youlus began , he has resettled Torahs everywhere from New Orleans to Uganda , he says .
" I have kept my promise but I 'll never be done .
There are thousands of Torahs out there . "
Ever since PayPal burst on to the scene , the Nostradamus types have been predicting one PayPal killer after another .
First it was " e- gold , " then Western Union , then C2IT ( by Citibank ) , then Google .
None of these players have put a dent in PayPal , and in fact more than a few of them have gone the way of the dodo .
Even Google Checkout is having problems these days .
The space is about to get much more competitive now that Microsoft has announced their plans to build a micropayment service with a twist .
The killer feature ?
The Redmond giant apparently wants to take on Visa and MasterCard , among others .
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Bill Gates indicated that Microsoft was looking into finding a way to make so - called micropayments a reality online .
And to make it a reality , Gates noted that traditional credit card fees would need to be undercut , and severely .
See , the credit industry makes money not only off interest , but they also scoop up 2.75 % + $ 0.35 in fees for most transactions ( on average ) .
As you can see , this makes charging for inexpensive items quite unattractive ; a $ 0.25 charge would be instantly doubled on account of fees .
For people who have fantasies of selling web content by the page , this is unworkable .
The question is , how can Microsoft pull this off ?
The DOW Jones newswire quotes Gates as saying , " If you want to charge somebody $ 0.10 or $ 1 a month , that will just be a click ... you wo n't have to manage some funny thing or pay some big credit charge , where half of it goes to the clearing . "
Microsoft has two options .
First , Microsoft could expand its " Points " system , which earned notoriety with the Xbox Live Marketplace ( and was later tapped for the the Zune Marketplace ) .
Such a scheme would see users buying points in bulk and then paying for items with said points .
It 's a virtual currency ecosystem of sorts based on a fixed " exchange rate " between real currency and the points system .
This is not Microsoft 's only option , of course .
Instead of points , Microsoft could simply borrow a page from PayPal and deal in real currency .
I 'd recommend that the company do the latter , because " points " are not popular with the early - adopter crowd .
They obfuscate the real cost of things , and many users have reservations about buying large amounts of " points " that then sit somewhere , unused .
What will Microsoft do ?
That remains unclear , although Gates ' comments make it clear that the system will be open to third parties for integration , meaning that retailers and site operators should be able to plug into the payment system via an API Âa must - have feature for any payment system .
Gates ' plans would also mean that Microsoft 's system will undercut PayPal as well .
PayPal charges between 1.9 % and 2.9 % plus $ 0.30 on transactions , and thus is unsuitable for micropayments .
Microsoft 's cut of any such system would need to be considerably less than that to make micropayments work .
The upside to this , of course , is that small transaction fees could also apply to larger purchases , which could eventually see Microsoft encroaching on the turf of existing regular transaction processors , including PayPal and the credit card guys .
I 'm cautiously optimistic for Microsoft 's solution , but when you think back to Passport or even Microsoft Wallet , you know that there are plenty of opportunities for the project to go awry .
Still , I can't help but think that anything that puts pressure on credit card fees is a good thing .
Mnesia is not perfect , of course , and its biggest downside at the moment is that its disc storage engine is n't suited for storing large volumes of data ( Mnesia was designed for soft real - time applications where the data is stored mostly in RAM ) , but I hope this will be resolved in the not - too - distant future .

I 'm really interested in distributed computing and concurrency right now .
Given that I 've been playing with Haskell so much , I thought I 'd give Erlang a try since it's all about distributed computing , concurrency , and scalability .
I must admit that it already seems easier for me to read than Haskell .
I 'm not sure why .
As I mentioned before , I do like Erlang - style concurrency , since strangely enough , that 's how I had always thought thingswork .
I 'm fascinated by Mnesia , Erlang 's distributed database .
Unfortunately , according to this
This is a major downer for me because I 'm currently interested in terabyte - sized data sets .
Nor is there a suitable MySQL driver Yaws is the Web application framework for Erlang .
I can't say whether it 's good or bad , but , ever since I used Apache 's Element Construction
Set back in the day , I 've had a particular dislike for generating HTML using programming language syntax as is done in Yaws : Yuck :( Nonetheless , Erlang hastaught me new ways of thinking about distributed computing .
I guess I 'm wondering if there 's anything I can't doin Python .
Afterall , consider Candigram , which is an implementation of Erlang concurrency primitives in Python ; although Candigram itself does n't provide microthreads like Erlang .
That reminds me , I 'm still looking for an answer to my post Limitations of Coroutines via Enhanced Generators
And if you 're wondering -- no , I do n't know what the hell I 'm talking about !
I 've only been looking at this stuff for like two days !
I guess I should just shut up and go back to reading Erlang for C , C++ and Java Programmers .
Hmm , I wonder where the tutorial for Python programmers is ;)

Women shunned high - flyers for men with average jobs
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the University of Central Lancashire research found the 186 female students asked preferred good - looking men .
But within that group , those without top careers were deemed most suitable , the Personality and Individual Differences journal reported .
The team said women seemed to feel high - flyers would not be good fathers .
We suggest that females see physically attractive , high status males as being more likely to pursue a mating strategy rather than a parenting strategy
Simon Chu , lead researcher
Send us your comments
Lead researcher Simon Chu said the high - earning career men were deemed to be " too good to be true " .
" Under particular circumstances , high socio- economic status in males can be subtly counter - productive in terms of attractiveness as a long - term partner .
" We suggest that females see physically attractive , high status males as being more likely to pursue a mating strategy rather than a parenting strategy . "
Using photographs of 60 men in their 20s , researchers asked students to rate them on a physical attractiveness scale .
Six from the good looking group , six considered average and six judged unattractive were then selected .
Profession
Alongside each photograph they added information on the man 's age , what he was looking for in a partner and their profession .
The professions included high - status jobs such as architects and company directors , medium - status positions such as teachers or travel agents and so - called lower - status roles such as gardeners and postmen .
The researchers found that purely on looks , the best - looking men were assessed as the best partners .
But within this group , when professions were taken into account , those good - looking men with medium status jobs came out top .
Ingrid Collins , a consultant psychologist at the London Medical Centre , agreed potential parenting and providing skills were important .
" I think there will always be a pattern where women will take the lead in caring for the children .
" Because of this they will tend to go for someone who can look after and provide for their family . "
" I do n't think we 've even begun to see the awkwardness that this will create , " Mr. Roberts said .
" It leads you inevitably back to the very simple rule that confidentiality should be granted very sparingly , but when it 's granted , you can't take it back . "
Mr. Roberts said one consequence might be that " people in the know simply wo n't talk to us because there is a heavy element of risk . "
He added that one reason Mr. Woodward " has been so successful is that he's had one of the best records in the business of not breaking a confidence . "
" What are we giving up if we start intruding on that ? " Mr. Roberts said .
Having revealed Mr. Woodward 's involvement in the case in an article and a statement from Mr. Woodward on Wednesday and two follow - up articles Thursday , Mr. Downie said he no longer believed that The Post was " in a bind or a dilemma " simply because it had not published the source 's name .
" There are often things we know that our readers do n't know , " he said .
" Sometimes it 's for reasons of national security or public safety .
Sometimes it 's because we do n't have it confirmed to our satisfaction .
It takes us time to get information into publishable form . "
Mr. Downie noted that another Post reporter , Walter Pincus , had testified in a deposition about another source in the leak case whom the newspaper had not identified because of a promise of confidentiality .
Mr. Downie said Mr. Woodward was continuing to press his source for permission to print the name , as well as continuing to report on the leak case .
" He 's always reporting , " Mr. Downie said .
" I do n't know if it 'll become a story for him or for another reporter . "
In The Post 's newsroom , opinions were divided about the Woodward revelation , said Jeff Leen , assistant managing editor for investigations .

The Classical Idea of Sound Money
The principle of sound money that guided nineteenth - century monetary doctrines and policies was a product of classical political economy .
It was an essential part of the liberal program as developed by eighteenth - century social philosophy and propagated in the following century by the most influential political parties of Europe and America .
The liberal doctrine sees in the market economy the best , even the only possible , system of economic organization of society .
Private ownership of the means of production tends to shift control of production to the hands of those best fitted for this job and thus to secure for all members of society the fullest possible satisfaction of their needs .
It assigns to the consumers the power to choose those purveyors who supply them in the cheapest way with the articles they are most urgently asking for and thus subjects the entrepreneurs and the owners of the means of production , namely , the capitalists and the landowners , to the sovereignty of the buying public .
It makes nations and their citizens free and provides ample sustenance for a steadily increasing population .
As a system of peaceful cooperation under the division of labor , the market economy could not work without an institution warranting to its members protection against domestic gangsters and external foes .
Violent aggression can be thwarted only by armed resistance and repression .
Society needs an apparatus of defense , a state , a government , a police power .
Its undisturbed functioning must be safeguarded by continuous preparedness to repel aggressors .
But then a new danger springs up .
How keep under control the men entrusted with the handling of the government apparatus lest they turn their weapons against those whom they were expected to serve ?
The main political problem is how to prevent the rulers from becoming despots and enslaving the citizenry .
Defense of the individual 's liberty against the encroachment of tyrannical governments is the essential theme of the history of Western civilization .
The characteristic feature of the Occident is its peoples ' pursuit of liberty , a concern unknown to Orientals .
All the marvelous achievements of Western civilization are fruits grown on the tree of liberty .
It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments .
Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights .
The demand for constitutional guarantees and for bills of rights was a reaction against arbitrary rule and the nonobservance of old customs by kings .
The postulate of sound money was first brought up as a response to the princely practice of debasing the coinage .
It was later carefully elaborated and perfected in the age which â through the experience of the American continental currency , the paper money of the French Revolution and the British restriction period â had learned what a government can do to a nation 's currency system .
Modern cryptodespotism , which arrogates to itself the name of liberalism , finds fault with the negativity of the concept of freedom .
The censure is spurious as it refers merely to the grammatical form of the idea and does not comprehend that all civil rights can be as well defined in affirmative as in negative terms .
They are negative as they are designed to obviate an evil , namely omnipotence of the police power , and to prevent the state from becoming totalitarian .
They are affirmative as they are designed to preserve the smooth operation of the system of private property , the only social system that has brought about what is called civilization .
Thus the sound - money principle has two aspects .
It is affirmative in approving the market 's choice of a commonly used medium of exchange .
It is negative in obstructing the government 's propensity to meddle with the currency system .
The sound - money principle was derived not so much from the Classical economists ' analysis of the market phenomena as from their interpretation of historical experience .
It was an experience that could be perceived by a much larger public than the narrow circles of those conversant with economic theory .
Hence the sound - money idea became one of the most popular points of the liberal program .
Friends and foes of liberalism considered it one of the essential postulates of a liberal policy .
Sound money meant a metallic standard .
Standard coins should be in fact a definite quantity of the standard metal as precisely determined by the law of the country .
Only standard coins should have unlimited legal - tender quality .
Token coins and all kinds of moneylike paper should be , on presentation and without delay , redeemed in lawful standard money .
So far there was unanimity among the supporters of sound money .
But then the battle of the standards arose .
The defeat of those favoring silver and the unfeasibility of bimetallism eventually made the sound - money principle mean the gold standard .
At the end of the nineteenth century there was all over the world unanimity among businessmen and statesmen with regard to the indispensability of the gold standard .
Countries which were under a fiat - money system or under the silver standard considered adoption of the gold standard the foremost goal of their economic policy .
Those who disputed the eminence of the gold standard were dismissed as cranks by the representatives of the official doctrine â professors , bankers , statesmen , editors of the great newspapers and magazines .
It was a serious blunder of the supporters of sound money to adopt such tactics .
There is no use in dealing in a summary way with any ideology however foolish and contradictory it may appear .
Even a manifestly erroneous doctrine should be refuted by careful analysis and the unmasking of the fallacies implied .
A sound doctrine can win only by exploding the delusions of its adversaries .
The essential principles of the sound - money doctrine were and are impregnable .
But their scientific support in the last decades of the nineteenth century was rather shaky .
The attempts to demonstrate their reasonableness from the point of view of the Classical value theory were not very convincing and made no sense at all when this value concept had to be discarded .
But the champions of the new value theory for almost half a century restricted their studies to the problems of direct exchange and left the treatment of money and banking to routinists unfamiliar with economics .
There were treatises on catallactics which dealt only incidentally and cursorily with monetary matters , and there were books on currency and banking which did not even attempt to integrate their subject into the structure of a catallactic system .
Finally the idea evolved that the modern doctrine of value , the subjectivist or marginal utility doctrine , is unable to explain the problems of money 's purchasing power .
It is easy to comprehend how under such circumstances even the least tenable objections raised by the advocates of inflationism remained unanswered .
The gold standard lost popularity because for a very long time no serious attempts were made to demonstrate its merits and to explode the tenets of its adversaries .
The Virtues and Alleged Shortcomings of the Gold Standard
The excellence of the gold standard is to be seen in the fact that it renders the determination of the monetary unit 's purchasing power independent of the policies of governments and political parties .
Furthermore , it prevents rulers from eluding the financial and budgetary prerogatives of the representative assemblies .
Parliamentary control of finances works only if the government is not in a position to provide for unauthorized expenditures by increasing the circulating amount of fiat money .
Viewed in this light , the gold standard appears as an indispensable implement of the body of constitutional guarantees that make the system of representative government function .
When in the ' fifties of the nineteenth century gold production increased considerably in California and Australia , people attacked the gold standard as inflationary .
In those days Michel Chevalier , in his book Probable Depreciation of Gold , recommended the abandonment of the gold standard , and BÃ©ranger dealt with the same subject in one of his poems .
But later these criticisms subsided .
The gold standard was no longer denounced as inflationary but on the contrary as deflationary .
Even the most fanatical champions of inflation like to disguise their true intentions by declaring that they merely want to offset the contractionist pressure which the allegedly insufficient supply of gold tends to produce .
Yet it is clear that over the last generations there has prevailed a tendency of all commodity prices and wage rates to rise .
We may neglect dealing with the economic effects of a general tendency of money prices and money wages to drop .
For there is no doubt that what we have experienced over the last hundred years was just the opposite , namely , a secular tendency toward a drop in the monetary unit 's purchasing power , which was only temporarily interrupted by the aftermath of the breakdown of a boom intentionally created by credit expansion .
Gold became cheaper in terms of commodities , not dearer .
What the foes of the gold standard are asking for is not to reverse a prevailing tendency in the determination of prices , but to intensify very considerably the already prevailing upward trend of prices and wages .
They simply want to lower the monetary unit 's purchasing power at an accelerated pace .
Such a policy of radical inflationism is , of course , extremely popular .
But its popularity is to a great extent due to a misapprehension of its effects .
What people are really asking for is a rise in the prices of those commodities and services they are selling while the prices of those commodities and services which they are buying remain unchanged .
The potato grower aims at higher prices for potatoes .
He does not long for a rise in other prices .
He is injured if these other prices rise sooner or in greater proportion than the price of potatoes .
If a politician addressing a meeting declares that the government should adopt a policy which makes prices rise , his hearers are likely to applaud .
Yet each of them is thinking of a different price rise .
From time immemorial inflation has been recommended as a means to alleviate the burdens of poor worthy debtors at the expense of rich harsh creditors .
However , under capitalism the typical debtors are not the poor but the well - to - do owners of real estate , of firms , and of common stock , people who have borrowed from banks , savings banks , insurance companies , and bondholders .
The typical creditors are not the rich but people of modest means who own bonds and savings accounts or have taken out insurance policies .
If the common man supports anti-creditor measures , he does it because he ignores the fact that he himself is a creditor .
The idea that millionaires are the victims of an easy - money policy is an atavistic remnant .
For the naive mind there is something miraculous in the issuance of fiat money .
A magic word spoken by the government creates out of nothing a thing which can be exchanged against any merchandise a man would like to get .
How pale is the art of sorcerers , witches , and conjurors when compared with that of the government 's Treasury Department !
The government , professors tell us , " can raise all the money it needs by printing it . "
Taxes for revenue , announced a chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , are " obsolete . "
How wonderful !
And how malicious and misanthropic are those stubborn supporters of outdated economic orthodoxy who ask governments to balance their budgets by covering all expenditures out of tax revenue !
These enthusiasts do not see that the working of inflation is conditioned by the ignorance of the public and that inflation ceases to work as soon as the many become aware of its effects upon the monetary unit 's purchasing power .
In normal times , that is in periods in which the government does not tamper with the monetary standard , people do not bother about monetary problems .
Quite naively they take it for granted that the monetary unit 's purchasing power is " stable . "
They pay attention to changes occurring in the money prices of the various commodities .
They know very well that the exchange ratios between different commodities vary .
But they are not conscious of the fact that the exchange ratio between money on the one side and all commodities and services on the other side is variable too .
When the inevitable consequences of inflation appear and prices soar , they think that commodities are becoming dearer and fail to see that money is getting cheaper .
In the early stages of an inflation only a few people discern what is going on , manage their business affairs in accordance with this insight , and deliberately aim at reaping inflation gains .
The overwhelming majority are too dull to grasp a correct interpretation of the situation .
They go on in the routine they acquired in non-inflationary periods .
Filled with indignation , they attack those who are quicker to apprehend the real causes of the agitation of the market as " profiteers " and lay the blame for their own plight on them .
This ignorance of the public is the indispensable basis of the inflationary policy .
Inflation works as long as the housewife thinks : " I need a new frying pan badly .
But prices are too high today ; I shall wait until they drop again . "
It comes to an abrupt end when people discover that the inflation will continue , that it causes the rise in prices , and that therefore prices will skyrocket infinitely .
The critical stage begins when the housewife thinks : " I do n't need a new frying pan today ; I may need one in a year or two .
But I 'll buy it today because it will be much more expensive later . "
Then the catastrophic end of the inflation is close .
In its last stage the housewife thinks : " I do n't need another table ; I shall never need one .
But it 's wiser to buy a table than keep these scraps of paper that the government calls money , one minute longer . "
Let us leave the problem of whether or not it is advisable to base a system of government finance upon the intentional deception of the immense majority of the citizenry .
It is enough to stress the point that such a policy of deceit is self - defeating .
Here the famous dictum of Lincoln holds true :
You can't fool all of the people all of the time .
Eventually the masses come to understand the schemes of their rulers .
Then the cleverly concocted plans of inflation collapse .
Whatever compliant government economists may have said , inflationism is not a monetary policy that can be considered as an alternative to a sound - money policy .
It is at best a temporary expedient .
The main problem of an inflationary policy is how to stop it before the masses have seen through their rulers ' artifices .
It is a display of considerable naivete to recommend openly a monetary system that can work only if its essential features are ignored by the public .
The index - number method is a very crude and imperfect means of " measuring " changes occurring in the monetary unit 's purchasing power .
As there are in the field of social affairs no constant relations between magnitudes , no measurement is possible and economics can never become quantitative .
But the index - number method , notwithstanding its inadequacy , plays an important role in the process which in the course of an inflationary movement makes the people inflation - conscious .
Once the use of index numbers becomes common , the government is forced to slow down the pace of the inflation and to make the people believe that the inflationary policy is merely a temporary expedient for the duration of a passing emergency , one that will be stopped before long .
While government economists still praise the superiority of inflation as a lasting scheme of monetary management , governments are compelled to exercise restraint in its application .
It is permissible to call a policy of intentional inflation dishonest as the effects sought by its application can be attained only if the government succeeds in deceiving the greater part of the people about the consequences of its policy .
Many of the champions of interventionist policies will not scruple greatly about such cheating ; in their eyes what the government does can never be wrong .
But their lofty moral indifference is at a loss to oppose an objection to the economist 's argument against inflation .
In the economist 's eyes the main issue is not that inflation is morally reprehensible but that it cannot work except when resorted to with great restraint and even then only for a limited period .
Hence resort to inflation cannot be considered seriously as an alternative to a permanent standard such as the gold standard is .
The pro-inflationist propaganda emphasizes nowadays the alleged fact that the gold standard collapsed and that it will never be tried again : nations are no longer willing to comply with the rules of the gold - standard game and to bear all the costs which the preservation of the gold standard requires .
First of all there is need to remember that the gold standard did not collapse .
Governments abolished it in order to pave the way for inflation .
The whole grim apparatus of oppression and coercion â policemen , customs guards , penal courts , prisons , in some countries even executioners â had to be put into action in order to destroy the gold standard .
Solemn pledges were broken , retroactive laws were promulgated , provisions of constitutions and bills of rights were openly defied .
And hosts of servile writers praised what the governments had done and hailed the dawn of the fiat - money millennium .
The most remarkable thing about this allegedly new monetary policy , however , is its complete failure .
True , it substituted fiat money in the domestic markets for sound money and favored the material interests of some individuals and groups of individuals at the expense of others .
It furthermore contributed considerably to the disintegration of the international division of labor .
But it did not succeed in eliminating gold from its position as the international or world standard .
If you glance at the financial page of any newspaper you discover at once that gold is still the world 's money and not the variegated products of the diverse government printing offices .
These scraps of paper are the more appreciated the more stable their price is in terms of an ounce of gold .
Whoever today dares to hint at the possibility that nations may return to a domestic gold standard is cried down as a lunatic .
This terrorism may still go on for some time .
But the position of gold as the world 's standard is impregnable .
The policy of " going off the gold standard " did not relieve a country 's monetary authorities from the necessity of taking into account the monetary unit 's price in terms of gold .
What those authors who speak about the rules of the gold - standard game have in mind is not clear .
Of course , it is obvious that the gold standard cannot function satisfactorily if to buy or to sell or to hold gold is illegal , and hosts of judges , constables , and informers are busily enforcing the law .
But the gold standard is not a game ; it is a market phenomenon and as such a social institution .
Its preservation does not depend on the observation of some specific rules .
It requires nothing else than that the government abstain from deliberately sabotaging it .
To refer to this condition as a rule of an alleged game is no more reasonable than to declare that the preservation of Paul 's life depends on compliance with the rules of the Paul 's - life game because Paul must die if somebody stabs him to death .
What all the enemies of the gold standard spurn as its main vice is precisely the same thing that in the eyes of the advocates of the gold standard is its main virtue , namely , its incompatibility with a policy of credit expansion .
The nucleus of all the effusions of the anti-gold authors and politicians is the expansionist fallacy .
The expansionist doctrine does not realize that interest , that is , the discount of future goods as against present goods , is an originary category of human valuation , actual in any kind of human action and independent of any social institutions .
The expansionists do not grasp the fact that there never were and there never can be human beings who attach to an apple available in a year or in a hundred years the same value they attach to an apple available now .
In their opinion interest is an impediment to the expansion of production and consequently to human welfare that unjustified institutions have created in order to favor the selfish concerns of money lenders .
Interest , they say , is the price people must pay for borrowing .
Its height therefore depends on the magnitude of the supply of money .
If laws did not artificially restrict the creation of additional money , the rate of interest would drop , ultimately even to zero .
The " contractionist " pressure would disappear , there would no longer be a shortage of capital , and it would become possible to execute many business projects which the " restrictionism " of the gold standard obstructs .
What is needed to make everyone prosperous is simply to defy " the rules of the gold - standard game , " the observance of which is the main source of all our economic ills .
These absurd doctrines greatly impressed ignorant politicians and demagogues when they were blended with nationalist slogans .
What prevents our country from fully enjoying the advantages of a low - interest - rate policy , says the economic isolationist , is its adherence to the gold standard .
Our central bank is forced to keep its rate of discount at a height that corresponds to conditions on the international money market and to the discount rates of foreign central banks .
Otherwise " speculators " would withdraw funds from our country for short - term investment abroad and the resulting outflow of gold would make the gold reserves of our central bank drop below the legal ratio .
If our central bank were not obliged to redeem its banknotes in gold , no such withdrawal of gold could occur and there would be no necessity for it to adjust the height of the money rate to the situation of the international money market , dominated by the world - embracing gold monopoly .
The most amazing fact about this argument is that it was raised precisely in debtor countries for which the operation of the international money and capital market meant an inflow of foreign funds and consequently the appearance of a tendency toward a drop in interest rates .
It was popular in Germany and still more in Austria in the 1870s and 80s , but it was hardly ever seriously mentioned in those years in England or in the Netherlands , whose banks and bankers lent amply to Germany and Austria .
It was advanced in England only after World War I , when Great Britain 's position as the world 's banking center had been lost .
Of course , the argument itself is untenable .
The inevitable eventual failure of any attempt at credit expansion is not caused by the international intertwinement of the lending business .
It is the outcome of the fact that it is impossible to substitute fiat money and a bank 's circulation credit for non-existing capital goods .
Credit expansion initially can produce a boom .
But such a boom is bound to end in a slump , in a depression .
What bring about the recurrence of periods of economic crises are precisely the reiterated attempts of governments and banks supervised by them to expand credit in order to make business good by cheap interest rates .
The Full - Employment Doctrine
The inflationist or expansionist doctrine is presented in several varieties .
But its essential content remains always the same .
The oldest and most naive version is that of the allegedly insufficient supply of money .
Business is bad , says the grocer , because my customers or prospective customers do not have enough money to expand their purchases .
So far he is right .
But when he adds that what is needed to render his business more prosperous is to increase the quantity of money in circulation , he is mistaken .
What he really has in mind is an increase of the amount of money in the pockets of his customers and prospective customers while the amount of money in the hands of other people remains unchanged .
He asks for a specific kind of inflation ; namely , an inflation in which the additional new money first flows into the cash holdings of a definite group of people , his customers , and thus permits him to reap inflation gains .
Of course , everybody who advocates inflation does it because he infers that he will belong to those who are favored by the fact that the prices of the commodities and services they sell will rise at an earlier date and to a higher point than the prices of those commodities and services they buy .
Nobody advocates an inflation in which he would be on the losing side .
This spurious grocer philosophy was once and for all exploded by Adam Smith and Jean - Baptiste Say .
In our day it has been revived by Lord Keynes , and under the name of full - employment policy is one of the basic policies of all governments which are not entirely subject to the Soviets .
Yet Keynes was at a loss to advance a tenable argument against Say 's law .
Nor have his disciples or the hosts of economists , pseudo and other , in the offices of the various governments , the United Nations , and diverse other national or international bureaus done any better .
The fallacies implied in the Keynesian full - employment doctrine are , in a new attire , essentially the same errors which Smith and Say long since demolished .
Wage rates are a market phenomenon , are the prices paid for a definite quantity of labor of a definite quality .
If a man can not sell his labor at the price he would like to get for it , he must lower the price he is asking for it or else he remains unemployed .
If the government or labor unions fix wage rates at a higher point than the potential rate of the unhampered labor market and if they enforce their minimum - price decree by compulsion and coercion , a part of those who want to find jobs remain unemployed .
Such institutional unemployment is the inevitable result of the methods applied by present - day self - styled progressive governments .
It is the real outcome of measures falsely labeled pro-labor .
There is only one efficacious way toward a rise in real wage rates and an improvement of the standard of living of the wage earners : to increase the per -head quota of capital invested .
This is what laissez - faire capitalism brings about to the extent that its operation is not sabotaged by government and labor unions .
We do not need to investigate whether the politicians of our age are aware of these facts .
In most universities it is not good form to mention them to the students .
Books that are skeptical with regard to the official doctrines are not widely bought by the libraries or used in courses , and consequently publishers are afraid to publish them .
Newspapers seldom criticize the popular creed because they fear a boycott on the part of the unions .
Thus politicians may be utterly sincere in believing that they have won " social gains " for the " people " and that the spread of unemployment is one of the evils inherent in capitalism and is in no way caused by the policies of which they are boasting .
However this may be , it is obvious that the reputation and the prestige of the men who are now ruling the countries outside the Soviet bloc and of their professorial and journalistic allies are so inseparably tied up with the " progressive " doctrine that they must cling to it .
If they do not want to forsake their political ambitions , they must stubbornly deny that their own policy tends to make mass unemployment a permanent phenomenon and must try to put on capitalism the blame for the undesired effects of their procedures .
The most characteristic feature of the full - employment doctrine is that it does not provide information about the way in which wage rates are determined on the market .
To discuss the height of wage rates is taboo for the " progressives . "
When they deal with unemployment , they do not refer to wage rates .
As they see it , the height of wage rates has nothing to do with unemployment and must never be mentioned in connection with it .
If there are unemployed , says the progressive doctrine , the government must increase the amount of money in circulation until full employment is reached .
It is , they say , a serious mistake to call inflation an increase in the quantity of money in circulation effected under these conditions .
It is just " full - employment policy . "
We may refrain from frowning upon this terminological oddity of the doctrine .
The main point is that every increase in the quantity of money in circulation brings about a tendency of prices and wages to rise .
If , in spite of the rise of commodity prices , wage rates do not rise at all or if their rise lags sufficiently behind the rise in commodity prices , the number of people unemployed on account of the height of wage rates will drop .
But it will drop merely because such a configuration of commodity prices and wage rates means a drop in real wage rates .
In order to attain this result it would not have been necessary to embark upon increasing the amount of money in circulation .
A reduction in the height of the minimum - wage rates enforced by the government or union pressure would have achieved the same effect without at the same time starting all the other consequences of an inflation .
It is a fact that in some countries in the 1930s , recourse to inflation was not immediately followed by a rise in the height of money wage rates as fixed by the governments or unions , that this was tantamount to a drop in real wage rates , and that consequently the number of unemployed decreased .
But this was merely a passing phenomenon .
When in 1936 Lord Keynes declared that a movement of employers to revise money - wage bargains downward would be much more strongly resisted than a gradual and " automatic " lowering of real wage rates as a result of rising prices , he had already been outdated and refuted by the march of events .
The masses had already begun to see through the artifices of inflation .
Problems of purchasing power and index numbers became an important issue in the unions ' dealings with wage rates .
The full - employment argument in favor of inflation was already behind the times at the very moment when Keynes and his followers proclaimed it as the fundamental principle of progressive economic policies .
The Emergency Argument in Favor of Inflation
All the economic arguments in favor of inflation are untenable .
The fallacies have long since been exploded in an irrefutable way .
There is , however , a political argument in favor of inflation that requires special analysis .
This political argument is only rarely resorted to in books , articles , and political speeches .
It does not lend itself to such public treatment .
But the underlying idea plays an important role in the thinking of statesmen and historians .
Its supporters fully accept all the teachings of the sound - money doctrine .
They do not share the errors of the inflationist quacks .
They realize that inflationism is a self - defeating policy which must inevitably lead to an economic cataclysm and that all its allegedly beneficial effects are , even from the point of view of the authors of the inflationary policy , more undesirable than the evils which were to be cured by inflation .
In full awareness of all this , however , they still believe that there are emergencies which peremptorily require or at least justify recourse to inflation .
A nation , they say , can be menaced by evils which are incomparably more disastrous than the effects of inflation .
If it is possible to avoid the total annihilation of a nation 's freedom and culture by a temporary abandonment of sound money , no reasonable objection can be raised against such a procedure .
It would simply mean preferring a smaller evil to a greater one .
In order to appraise correctly the weight of this emergency argument in favor of inflation , there is need to realize that inflation does not add anything to a nation 's power of resistance , either to its material resources or to its spiritual and moral strength .
Whether there is inflation or not , the material equipment required by the armed forces must be provided out of the available means by restricting consumption for non-vital purposes , by intensifying production in order to increase output , and by consuming a part of the capital previously accumulated .
All these things can be done if the majority of citizens are firmly resolved to offer resistance to the best of their abilities and are prepared to make such sacrifices for the sake of preserving their independence and culture .
Then the legislature will adopt fiscal methods which warrant the achievement of these goals .
They will attain what is called economic mobilization or a defense economy without tampering with the monetary system .
The great emergency can be dealt with without recourse to inflation .
But the situation those advocating emergency inflation have in mind is of a quite different character .
Its characteristic feature is an irreconcilable antagonism between the opinions of the government and those of the majority of the people .
The government , in this regard supported by only a minority of the people , believes that there exists an emergency that necessitates a considerable increase in public expenditure and a corresponding austerity in private households .
But the majority of the people disagree .
They do not believe that conditions are so bad as the government depicts them or they think that the preservation of the values endangered is not worth the sacrifices they would have to make .
There is no need to raise the question whether the government 's or the majority 's opinion is right .
Perhaps the government is right .
However , we deal not with the substance of the conflict but with the methods chosen by the rulers for its solution .
They reject the democratic way of persuading the majority .
They arrogate to themselves the power and the moral right to circumvent the will of the people .
They are eager to win its cooperation by deceiving the public about the costs involved in the measures suggested .
While seemingly complying with the constitutional procedures of representative government , their conduct is in effect not that of elected officeholders but that of guardians of the people .
The elected executive no longer deems himself the people 's mandatory ; he turns into a fÃ¼hrer .
The emergency that brings about inflation is this : the people or the majority of the people are not prepared to defray the costs incurred by their rulers ' policies .
They support these policies only to the extent that they believe their conduct does not burden themselves .
They vote , for instance , only for such taxes as are to be paid by other people , namely , the rich , because they think that these taxes do not impair their own material well - being .
The reaction of the government to this attitude of the nation is , at least sometimes , directed by the sincere wish to serve what it believes to be the true interests of the people in the best possible way .
But if the government resorts for this purpose to inflation , it is employing methods which are contrary to the principles of representative government , although formally it may have fully complied with the letter of the constitution .
It is taking advantage of the masses ' ignorance , it is cheating the voters instead of trying to convince them .
It is not just an accident that in our age inflation has become the accepted method of monetary management .
Inflation is the fiscal complement of statism and arbitrary government .
It is a cog in the complex of policies and institutions which gradually lead toward totalitarianism .
Western liberty cannot hold its ground against the onslaughts of Oriental slavery if the peoples do not realize what is at stake and are not ready to make the greatest sacrifices for the ideals of their civilization .
Recourse to inflation may provide the government with the funds which it could neither collect by taxation nor borrow from the savings of the public because the people and its parliamentary representatives objected .
Spending the newly created fiat money , the government can buy the equipment the armed forces need .
But a nation reluctant to make the material sacrifices necessary for victory will never display the requisite mental energy .
What warrants success in a fight for freedom and civilization is not merely material equipment but first of all the spirit that animates those handling the weapons .
This heroic spirit cannot be bought by inflation .
Animals of this and similar species of Antarctic sponges grow extremely slowly in the low temperatures .
Estimates based on growth rates suggest a very long lifespan in this and similar animals .
One two meter high specimen in the Ross Sea was estimated to be 23,000 years old , though because of sea level fluctuations in the Ross Sea it is unlikely that such an animal could have lived for more than 15,000 years [ 0688 ] .
Even if 15,000 years is an overestimate , which may well be the case , this specimen appears to be the longest - lived animal on earth .
" A tree is a wonderful living organism which gives shelter , food ,
warmth and protection to all living things .
It even gives shade to
those who wield an axe to cut it down " - Buddha .
There are probably hundreds of majestic and magnificent trees in the world - of these , some are particularly special :

Buffeted by the cold Pacific Ocean wind , the scraggly Lone Cypress [ wiki ] ( Cupressus macrocarpa ) in Pebble Beach , Monterey Peninsula , California , is n't a particularly large tree .
It makes up for its small size , however , with its iconic status as a stunningly beautiful tree in splendid isolation , framed by an even more beautiful background of the Pacific Ocean .
9. Circus Trees
As a hobby , bean farmer Axel Erlandson [ wiki ] shaped trees - he pruned , bent , and grafted trees into fantastic shapes and called them " Circus Trees . "
For example , to make this " Basket Tree " arborsculpture , Erlandson planted six sycamore trees in a circle and then grafted them together to form the diamond patterns .

Erlandson was very secretive and refused to reveal his methods on how to grow the Circus Trees ( he even carried out his graftings behind screens to protect against spies ! ) and carried the secrets to his grave .
The trees were later bought by millionaire Michael Bonfante , who transplanted them to his amusement park Bonfante Gardens in Gilroy in 1985 .
8. Giant Sequoias : General Sherman
( Image credit : Humpalumpa [ flickr ] )
Giant Sequoias [ wiki ] ( Sequoiadendron giganteum ) , which only grow in Sierra Nevada , California , are the world 's biggest trees ( in terms of volume ) .
The biggest is General Sherman [ wiki ] in the Sequoia National Park - one behemoth of a tree at 275 feet ( 83.8 m ) , over 52,500 cubic feet of volume ( 1,486 mÂ³ ) , and over 6000 tons in weight .
General Sherman is approximately 2,200 years old - and each year , the tree adds enough wood to make a regular 60 - foot tall tree .
It 's no wonder that naturalist John Muir said " The Big Tree is Nature 's forest masterpiece , and so far as I know , the greatest of living things . "
For over a century there was a fierce competition for the title of the largest tree : besides General Sherman , there is General Grant [ wiki ] at King 's Canyon National Park , which actually has a larger circumference ( 107.5 feet / 32.77 m vs. Sherman 's 102.6 feet / 31.27 m ) .
In 1921 , a team of surveyors carefully measured the two giants - with their data , and according to the complex American Forestry Association system of judging a tree , General Grant should have been award the title of largest tree - however , to simplify the matter , it was later determined that in this case , volume , not point system , should be the determining factor .
7. Coast Redwood : Hyperion and Drive - Thru Trees
There is another sequoia species ( not to be confused with Giant Sequoia ) that is quite remarkable : the Coast Redwood [ wiki ] ( Sequoia sempervirens ) , the tallest trees in the world .
The reigning champion is a tree called Hyperion in the Redwood National Park , identified by researcher Chris Atkins and amateur naturalist Michael Taylor in 2006 .
Measuring over 379 feet ( 155.6 115 m ) tall , Hyperion beat out the previous record holder Stratosphere Giant [ wiki ] in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park ( at 370 feet / 112.8 m ) .
The scientists are n't talking about the exact location of Hyperion : the terrain is difficult , and they do n't want a rush of visitors to come and trample the tree 's root system .
[ Image : The Stratosphere Giant - still an impressive specimen , previously the world 's tallest tree until dethroned by Hyperion in 2006 . ]
That 's not all that 's amazing about the Coast Redwood : there are four giant California redwoods big enough that you can drive your car through them !
The most famous of the drive - through trees is the Chandelier Tree [ wiki ] in Leggett , California .
It 's a 315 foot tall redwood tree , with a 6 foot wide by 9 foot tall hole cut through its base in the 1930s .

The ChÃªne - Chapelle ( Chapel - Oak ) of Allouville - Bellefosse is the most famous tree in France - actually , it 's more than just a tree : it 's a building and a religious monument all in one .
In 1669 , l 'Abbe du Detroit and du Cerceau decided to build a chapel in ( at that time ) a 500 years old or so oak ( Quercus robur ) tree made hollow by a lightning bolt .
The priests built a small altar to the Virgin Mary .
Later on , a second chapel and a staircase were added .
Now , parts of the tree are dead , the crown keeps becoming smaller and smaller every year , and parts of the tree 's bark , which fell off due to old age , are covered by protective oak shingles .
Poles and cables support the aging tree , which in fact , may not live much longer .
As a symbol , however , it seems that the Chapel - Oak of Allouville - Bellefosse may live on forever .
5. Quaking Aspen : Pando ( The Trembling Giant )

Pando [ wiki ] or the Trembling Giant in Utah is actually a colony of a single Quaking Aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) tree .
All of the trees ( technically , " stems " ) in this colony are genetically identical ( meaning , they 're exact clones of one another ) .
In fact , they are all a part of a single living organism with an enormous underground root system .
Pando , which is Latin for " I Spread , " is composed of about 47,000 stems spread throughout 107 acres of land .
It estimated to weigh 6,600 tons , making it the heaviest known organism .
Although the average age of the individual stems are 130 years , the entire organism is estimated to be about 80,000 years old !

Local legends say that you can make out animals like jaguars and elephants in the trunk , giving the tree the nickname of " the Tree of Life " ( Image credit : jvcluis [ flickr ] )
El Ãrbol del Tule [ wiki ] ( " The Tule Tree " ) is an especially large Montezuma cypress ( Taxodium mucronatum ) near the city of Oaxaca , Mexico .
This tree has the largest trunk girth at 190 feet ( 58 m ) and trunk diameter at 37 feet ( 11.3 m ) .
The Tule tree is so thick that people say you do n't hug this tree , it hugs you instead !
For a while , detractors argued that it was actually three trees masquerading as one - however , careful DNA analysis confirmed that it is indeed one magnificent tree .
In 1994 , the tree ( and Mexican pride ) were in jeopardy : the leaves were sickly yellow and there were dead branches everywhere - the tree appeared to be dying .
When tree " doctors " were called in , they diagnosed the problem as dying of thirst .
The prescription ?
Give it water .
Sure enough , the tree soon recovered after a careful watering program was followed .
3. Banyan Tree : Sri Maha Bodhi Tree
The Banyan tree is named after " banians " or Hindu traders who carry out their business under the tree .
Even if you have never heard of a Banyan tree ( it was the tree used by Robinson Crusoe for his treehouse ) , you 'd still recognize it .
The shape of the giant tree is unmistakable : it has a majestic canopy with aerial roots running from the branches to the ground .

If you were thinking that the Banyan tree looks like the trees whose roots snake through the ruins of the Ta Prohm temple like tentacles of the jungle ( Lara Croft , anyone ? ) at Ankor , Cambodia , you 'd be right !

One of the most famous species of Banyan , called the Sacred Fig [ wiki ] or Bo tree , is the Sri Maha Bodhi [ wiki ] tree in Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka .
It is said that the tree was grown from a cutting from the original tree under which Buddha became enlightened in the 6th century BC .
Planted in 288 BC , it is the oldest living human - planted tree in the world , with a definitive planting date !

2. Bristlecone Pine : Methuselah and Prometheus , the Oldest Trees in the World .

The oldest living tree in the world is a White Mountains , California , bristlecone pine ( Pinus longaeva ) named Methuselah [ wiki ] , after the Biblical figure who lived to 969 years old .
The Methuselah tree , found at 11,000 feet above sea level , is 4,838 years old - it is not only the oldest tree but also the oldest living non-clonal organism in the world .
Before Methuselah was identified as the world 's oldest tree by Edmund Schulman in 1957 , people thought that the Giant Sequoias were the world 's oldest trees at about 2,000 years old .
Schulman used a borer to obtain a core sample to count the growth rings of various bristlecone pines , and found over a dozen trees over 4,000 years old .
The story of Prometheus [ wiki ] is even more interesting : in 1964 , Donald R. Currey [ wiki ] , then a graduate student , was taking core samples from a tree named Prometheus .
His boring tool broke inside the tree , so he asked for permission from the US Forest Service to cut it down and examine the full cross section of the wood .
Surprisingly the Forest Service agreed !
When they examined the tree , Prometheus turned out to be about 5,000 years old , which would have made it the world 's oldest tree when the scientist unwittingly killed it !

Today , to protect the trees from the inquisitive traveler , the authorities are keeping their location secret ( indeed , there are no photos identifying Methuselah for fear of vandalism ) .
1. Baobab
The amazing baobab [ wiki ] ( Adansonia ) or monkey bread tree can grow up to nearly 100 feet ( 30 m ) tall and 35 feet ( 11 m ) wide .
Their defining characteristic : their swollen trunk are actually water storage - the baobab tree can store as much as 31,700 gallon ( 120,000 l ) of water to endure harsh drought conditions .
Baobab trees are native to Madagascar ( it 's the country 's national tree ! ) , mainland Africa , and Australia .
A cluster of " the grandest of all " baobab trees ( Adansonia grandidieri ) can be found in the Baobab Avenue , near Morondava , in Madagascar :

The baobab trees in Africa are amazing as well :

Legend has it that the Tree That Owns Itself [ wiki ] , a white oak in Athens , Georgia was given ownership of itself and the surrounding land by Dr. William Henry Jackson in 1820 !
The original tree had died long ago , but a new tree ( Son of The Tree That Owns Itself ) was planted at the same location from one of its acorns .
Bonus 2 : The Lonely Tree of TÃ©nÃ©rÃ©
The Tree of TÃ©nÃ©rÃ© in the 1970s , before a truck crashed into it ( Image credit : Peter Krohn )
The Tree of TÃ©nÃ©rÃ© or L'Abre du TÃ©nÃ©rÃ© was the world 's most isolated tree - the solitary acacia , which grew in the Sahara desert in Niger , Africa , was the only tree within more than 250 miles ( 400 km ) around .
The tree was the last surviving member of a group of acacias that grew when the desert was n't as dry .
When scientists dug a hole near the tree , they found its roots went down as deep as 120 feet ( 36 m ) below to the water table !
Apparently , being the only tree in that part of the wide - open desert ( remember : there was n't another tree for 250 miles around ) , was n't enough to stop a drunk Libyan truck driver from driving his truck into it , knocking it down and killing it !
Now , a metal sculpture was placed in its spot to commemorate the Lonely Tree of TÃ©nÃ©rÃ© :

I 'll be the first to acknowledge that this list is far from complete : there are many more magnificent trees in the world ( for instance , see the List of Famous Trees [ wiki ] ) .
If you have any addition of noteworthy tree ( and stories about trees ) , please leave it in the comment section .
Earth 's oldest known tree stood nearly 30 feet tall and looked like a modern palm , a new reconstruction shows .
Workers uncovered hundreds of upright stumps of the 385 million - year - old tree more than a century ago , after a flash flood in Gilboa , New York uncovered them , but little else was known about the tree âs appearance .
Then , in 2004 , scientists unearthed a 400 - pound fossilized top â or crown â of the same genus a few miles away .
The following summer , the same team discovered fragments of a 28 - foot trunk .
Piecing together stump , trunk and crown now reveals what the full tree looked like for the first time .
â These were very big trees , â said study team member William Stein , a paleobotanist at the State University of New York at Binghamton .
â Our reconstruction shows them to be a lot longer and much more treelike than any of the reconstructions before , â Stein told LiveScience .
â I do nât think any of us dared think of them being quite that big . â
The tree belonged to a group of early fern - like plants called Wattieza .
Unlike flowering plants , which use seeds to reproduce , Wattieza used spores , the reproductive method of choice for algae , ferns and fungi .
The finding , detailed in the March 19 issue of the journal Nature , will help scientists understand a crucial turning - point in our planet âs history â when the first forests appeared .
â In forming the first forests , they must have really changed the Earth system as a whole , creating new types of micro-environments for smaller plants and insects , storing large amounts of carbon and binding the soil together , â said study leader Christopher Berry of Cardiff University in Wales .
Now extinct , Wattieza lived during the Middle Devonian period , before aquatic creatures clambered onto land .
â The trees preceded dinosaurs by 140 million years , â said study team member Ed Landing of the New York State Museum .
â There was nothing flying , no reptiles and no amphibians . â
The rise of land plants such as Wattieza drastically altered the climate and paved the way for terrestrial animals and insects .
â The rise of forests removed a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , â Berry explained .
â This caused temperatures to drop and the planet became very similar to its present - day conditions . â
The history of the Internet is filled with stories about companies that tried to make a positive change in the world and ended up failing miserably .
And then there are online term - paper sites .
Despite inspiring nothing but scorn from educators , purveyors of collegiate prose are finding life on the dark side of online commerce quite lucrative .
" They 're the only ones besides casinos or porn really making money on the Internet , " said Kenny Sahr , founder of SchoolSucks.com , a free homework site that makes money posting ads for fee- charging term paper providers .
If his advertising customers are any indication , Sahr said , online term - paper mills are weathering the dot - com bust remarkably well .
With the new school year about to begin , research paper companies are gearing up for peak season .
It appears academicians ' attempts to eradicate these hotbeds of plagiarism have done little to stifle their growth .
SchoolSucks is no exception .
Although the 6 - year - old site has n't made him rich , Sahr says it does provide enough money " to pay for my habits " and does n't require full - time work .
He runs the site with a staff of two , each working out of their homes and periodically holding meetings on a beach in Tel Aviv , where the operation is based .
Sahr attributes the site 's longevity largely to the fact that it gets its material for free , mostly through submissions from students .
This keeps the cost of running the business quite low .
SchoolSucks draws about 10,000 unique visitors on a typical day and has been growing steadily , Sahr said .
Meanwhile , traffic to competing sites is n't slowing either .
" I do n't think we 've had a year so far where we have n't grown , " said Jared Silvermintz , college student and co-founder of Genius Papers .
The site , which Silvermintz started as a junior in high school six years ago , charges $ 20 for a one - year subscription to a soon - to - be - upgraded database that he says will contain more than 40,000 papers .
Silvermintz says he 's probably sold more than 20,000 subscriptions in the six years he and his partner , Josh Levy , have been running the site .
Naturally , such success stories are anathema to educators , who had trouble enough fighting plagiarism before the Internet began tempting cheaters .
Although nearly all paper sites urge students to use their materials for " research purposes only , " it 's an accepted fact in the business that not everyone follows the rules .
" The way we want people to use this is as a research database , " Silvermintz said .
" But as far as how it 's actually used , I 'm sure there 's a ton of kids using it for plagiarism . "
This basic truth is not lost on teachers .
Over the past few years , educators have grown wise to cheaters ' tactics , said Diane Waryold , executive director of the Center for Academic Integrity .
" It used to be that you would look at a sample of a student 's work and you would get a gut feeling if it was more sophisticated than their standard of writing , " Waryold said .
" Now teachers will search through Google and they 'll do a bit of investigation . "
Waryold says academics are also changing the kind of assignments they give , looking for unique topics that are more difficult to plagiarize .
When all else fails , teachers also have an expanded array of tools they can use to crack down on plagiarism , such as Turnitin.com , a service that looks for similarities between student papers and previously published works .
Teachers are also among the more frequent visitors to the term - paper sites they so abhor .
In a user survey conducted by SchoolSucks , 48 percent of visitors to the site identified themselves as teachers .
Presumably , most were using the site to weed out plagiarism in their classrooms , although Sahr says he also gets resumes from teachers interested in working as term - paper writers .
But unlike many other sites that provide custom papers , SchoolSucks does n't pay for material .
Thus , it provides little opportunity for out - of - work term - paper writers .
Sahr says students should also keep the free submission policy in mind before they consider copying a paper from his archives .
Even if they do n't get caught , it might not be the greatest academic move .
" It does n't say on the papers ' A plus ' or ' A minus ' or anything .
In fact , I think a lot of them stink , " Sahr said .
Another entry for HOPL - III that is an interesting account of The Evolution of Lua by Roberto Ierusalimschy , Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes .
We report on the birth and evolution of Lua , and discuss how Lua moved from a simple configuration language to a versatile , widely used language that supports extensible semantics , anonymous functions , full lexical scoping , proper tail calls , and coroutines .
The paper is timely for me , since I recently acquired the book " Programming in Lua V2 " and am slowly trying to learn the language .
It 's hard not to like the model of language evolution taken by the Lua community .
Lua has actively staked the ground of an embeddable scripting language , having simplicity and size as a major focus , and a very active two way street between embedded scripting language and host language C .
The paper provides a good accounting of many of the design decisions made through the history of versions , though I would have liked a bit more mention of the decision to go with a register based VMs .
Overall , I 'd rate it as a very good read for those that are interested in PL design .
Other papers from HOPL - III mentioned on LtU : Haskell and AppleScript .
Clever Ravens Masters of Deceit
Ravens can toboggan , ride other animals and spy on their enemies .
Their life as cadgers stealing prey from wolves , eagles and bears has made them outstandingly intelligent .
But do ravens know what they 're doing and why ?

One of the main reasons that poor countries are poor and remain poor is because of excessive regulation of business ( see graph above - high income countries have significantly less regulation than poor countries ) .

JÃ¼rgen Kamm was fined 3,600 euros for his gear
Officials fear that neo -Nazis could skirt the ban
A Stuttgart court fined a German company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .
How far can individuals go in using a symbol banned by the German constitution ?
It was just this question that the Stuttgart district attorney âs office wanted clarified when it brought a case against Nix Gut , a mail - order company that offers left - wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
The swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but German law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to National Socialism .
A crossed - out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left - wing movement in Germany .
But a judge ruled on Friday that the use of the Nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , JÃ¼rgen Kamm , 3,600 euros ( $ 4,500 ) .
It is nât the first time that left - wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo -Nazis .
Last year , a student in TÃ¼bingen was fined for wearing an anti-Nazi button on his backpack .
The local court had argued that a Japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would nât recognize the crossed - out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
The student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
In another case , Nigerian soccer player Adebowale Ogungbure , who plays for Sachsen Leipzig made a mock Hitler salute to fans in Halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
The player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had nât understood the gesture was illegal .

OSLO â For a people whose deep national pride is in bestowing the Nobel Peace Prize , Norwegians are developing a reputation for throwing some sharp elbows .
And they are doing so in an unexpected way : by pulling investments out of Wal - Mart and other big companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin for what they say are ethical failings .
Norway has amassed a fortune of more than $ 300 billion over the last decade , thanks to its profits from oil exports .
Yet few countries are more ambivalent about their vast wealth than this modest , socially conscious society of less than five million people .
So rather than managing their monstrous nest egg simply for the best returns , the reluctant billionaires of Norway are using the money to advance an ambitious ethical code they established in 2004 for their oil reserve , known as the Government Pension Fund .
I have a good imagination .
Even when I disagree with a point of view , I can usually imagine how I might be wrong .
For example , I do nât believe that alien spaceships have visited earth , but I can imagine it .
And I do nât believe that Dick Cheney is the love child of Lucifer and a penguin .
Seriously , I do nât .
But I can imagine it .
What amazes me is when I run into a point of view that I literally canât imagine in any way that makes sense .
For example , I âve been trying to imagine how the â surge â strategy in Iraq could fix things .
The word â surge â implies it âs temporary .
The bad guys plan to be around forever , which is longer than temporary .
It seems to me that they âll just take their badness where the surge is nât happening and then come back after the U.S. forces leave .
That âs just my admittedly uneducated guess about how things work .
I could be wrong .
To give the alternate viewpoint a fair shake , I wrinkle my forehead and squint and try to imagine how the surge could work .
So far I have come up with these imagined scenarios :
1 . The insurgents from all over Iraq decide to throw their guns down and run toward Baghdad in broad daylight yelling WALALALALALALA !!!
SHOOT ME ! WALALALALALA !!!
2 . The word â surge â turns out to be the Arabic word for â pork flavored bullets . â
When word gets around , all the insurgents start yelling WALALALALALALA and running toward the ocean where they drown .
3 . The surge is successful at gaining control of parts of Baghdad .
This unexpected success seems to be a sign from God , so all the insurgents convert to Judaism .
They still yell WALALALALALALA but only at the Wailing Wall .
On the other side of the Iraq argument are the people who say the war has made the U.S. less safe because our military is stretched thin .
Huh ?
There âs no question that we âve depleted our military resources , especially the people .
But I âm trying to imagine the scenario where those reduced resources make me less safe .
Here âs what I âve imagined so far :
1. China decides it âs a good time to attack its most important customer and be incinerated in a nuclear fireball .
2 . We forgo the opportunity to invade Iran by land and , as is our custom , accidentally create a few million additional terrorists .
3 . We do nât have enough forces to pursue Bin Laden in the places where Pakistan does nât let us go anyway .
4 . We do nât have enough forces permanently stationed in Japan to help out in case Godzilla returns .
5 . Beer - soaked Canadians start throwing snowballs over the border and wo nât listen to reason .
That âs the best I can imagine .
Someone paint me a scene where either the surge works or the degradation of the military makes me less safe .
I âm here to learn .
A POINT OF VIEW
By Brian Walden
The well - spoken are condemned as " toffs "
A couple of recent events of less than outstanding importance have nevertheless touched off a spate of comment about how the British behave and what it means to be British .
On the reality show Celebrity Big Brother , offensive remarks were made to an Indian contestant , which upset many viewers , with the row rumbling on for days .
And research presented to the Foreign Office by the Montesquieu University in Bordeaux showed that thousands of Britons are buying homes in France in order to enjoy old - fashioned British values , which it 's claimed only exist in French villages .
All countries occasionally have a discussion about what they are and what they represent .
The exception is the United States of America , which has a permanent on - going debate about what it means to be an American .
But even older countries like France are n't so secure , or complacent , that they do n't need from time to time to brood about where they are as a society and how they got there .
BBC NEWS : AUDIO Hear A Point of View in the BBC Radio Player
Britain is coming to the end of the Blair era , because the prime minister will retire in the summer .
It 's been an important period in British history , but it leaves many questions unanswered .
Uncertainty is in the air and when it coincides with rapid change people clutch at any chance to talk about what worries them .
One of the things that worries them is so - called yob culture .
This concern is n't brushed aside by the prime minister on the grounds that he 's got bigger things to think about .
On the contrary , Tony Blair says cracking down on intimidating and unpleasant behaviour is vitally important .
He has established 40 special " respect " areas in the country and appointed Louise Carey , whom the media have dubbed a " respect Tsar " .
I 've rather lost track of how many of these Tsars are now operating in various fields , but the appointment of one is always a sign the issue is thought to be politically significant .
That unpleasant behaviour has become a social problem in Britain is confirmed by Montesquieu University , who cite it as one of the reasons why some of the urban British want to live in rural France .
Quarrels
But Celebrity Big Brother raises the question of whether being a yob is n't better than being a racist ?
I do n't want to go into the details of what happened in the programme , but I do think some things of importance can be learned from this row .
Celebrity Big Brother is part of what 's called reality television , which has become a modern passion .
What the makers of the programme do is to select contestants from very different backgrounds and give them nothing to do all day but talk to each other .
Big Brother sparked a debate about Britain
Naturally quarrels are inevitable .
This time it was because some of the English contestants - one in particular - made disparaging remarks about an Indian actress .
The remarks were racist said some .
No they were n't that bad said others , they were only what you 'd expect from ladettes and yobs .
I hope if there is going to be a serious national discussion about how the British behave , we face the truth that racism is n't the only evil social prejudice .
A view seems to be taking root that though racism is unspeakably vile , it 's understandable , perhaps even forgivable , that there should be quite a lot of class prejudice in Britain .
Regrettable of course , but in a way natural .
For do n't the so - called yobs detest the so - called nobs and regard them as stuck - up , idle and smarmy , just as they themselves are looked down on as illiterate chavs , who are n't even amusing , but simply dim , aggressive and piggish in their habits .
They perpetuate the vicious myth that someone with a plummy voice , who did n't in youth have a chip butty for tea , is a patronising snob
This ingrained class hatred has existed far longer in Britain than racial hatred and does at least as much harm .
The extent to which it lurks in the subconscious of some Britons was revealed when David Cameron made a comment about youths in hoods .
He was aware of the problems some of them presented , but thought along with social discipline we might show them some love .
This innocuous remark , that could well have been made from a hundred pulpits every Sunday , was greeted with much derision .
" Hug a hoodie " jeered the headlines .
Cameron 's statement was deemed to be ridiculously " soft " and very depressing for respectable opinion to hear .
Nobody dared say , but quite a few implied , that instead of worrying about the lack of love and role models in the life of the hoodies , the Tory leader would be better employed in finding some legal way for the police to use their truncheons to sweep this scum off the streets .
The class hatred coming the other way is just as bigoted .
Think of the intelligent , well - read men and women , who made their place in the world through scholarships and good teaching , but some of whom can't forgive anybody who was born into a privileged background .
They perpetuate the vicious myth that someone with a plummy voice , who did n't in youth have a chip butty for tea , is a patronising snob who despises most people he meets .
Plummy voice
I mention the plummy voice because accents are a British obsession .
I know of nowhere in the world where so many people are annoyed by hearing another person pronounce or intone words differently from the way they do .
Bill Clinton can take his southern drawl all over the US without doing himself any damage , even though everybody can tell he 's from one of the poorer parts of Dixie .
It 's not like that in Britain .
Yes , things are better than of old , but only the other day I heard a woman on television say she could n't vote for somebody because he " spoke like a toff " .
And it would n't be difficult to find those who can't vote for anybody with a cockney accent .
Class and accent are British obsessions
Why is class prejudice now judged in some circles to be less harmful than racial prejudice ?
Surely they both arise from the same mistake of judging only by appearances .
Idi Amin was black , but so was Martin Luther King .
Adolf Hitler was white , but so was Abraham Lincoln .
Perhaps we show increasing good sense about skin colour because the topic has received so much publicity .
Without overdoing it , we ought to be alert to class prejudice .
I spoke to someone recently who , though good at his job , could never please his boss , or get promotion .
One day he found out why .
After a busy morning his boss slapped him on the back and said : " Well , I must break for lunch and you should go and have your dinner . "
I believe British society should pay as much attention to class as to racial prejudice .
But , of course , it should n't become fixated by any social prejudice .
Zeal
I 'm not a fan of dozens of new laws and directives on the subject .
Tolerance develops best in a relaxed atmosphere .
As the famous French foreign minister , Talleyrand , said when briefing his associates : " Above all , gentlemen , not the slightest zeal . "
He recognised that feverish passion was counter - productive .
You may say it 's difficult to be deeply interested in something , yet not zealous .
Indeed it is , but that 's what we have statesmen for .
The rest of Britain has to vault the class barrier and reach out
Since British society has a " live and let live " attitude , there has to be a very good reason why it should do more to improve class - co- operation .
There is .
The old working - class has sub - divided .
Some of it is already middle - class in economic terms .
If it receives the occasional social slight , I deplore the fact , but it wo n't produce a crisis .
But part of the traditional working - class has slithered into becoming the underclass .
Its economic deprivation is probably less than that of a working - class family of yore , but every other standard that encourages improvement has withered .
Most of the underclass does n't live in a friendly community where they feel safe .
On many estates drug abuse and crime are part of everyday life .
And nobody is able to leave for a French village .
I think it 's now recognised across the entire political spectrum that the underclass has become a major social problem .
It 's gradually dropping out of national life .
You do n't have to like its ways to see it needs help .
The rest of Britain has to vault the class barrier and reach out - for pity 's sake .
Recently saw a whole section of Chav joke greetings cards in W H Smith .
I believe such jokes are very offensive and insulting .
Similar cards about blacks or muslims , for example , would quite rightly cause a public outcry , and possibly be illegal .
Geoff , Cardiff
It 's very easy to look at yob culture and place blame on others and tut disapprovingly , but until we accept our share of the blame , nothing will change .
These ' chavs ' feel neglected by a system created by ' posh ' middle - class politicians who have no idea what their life is like - and they 're right .
We 're abandoning this new underclass so we can focus on our own lives , but until we offer the help , funding and respect to every member of society equally , why should we expect respect from those felt neglected .
We all need to make an effort to understand all points of view and why certain people feel neglected by the political system if we want a cohesive and more stable society .
Michael Hardy , Swindon , United Kingdom
Simple attributes of courtesy , manners , tolerance ( in all its forms ) , respect for others ( and their property ) are basic things which bind a society together , irrespective of " class " .
If you can't or wo n't abide by these , you marginalise yourself from society and in turn , society from you .
Nobs or yobs , British society - per se - is guilty as charged .
R Wilson , Kenilworth , England
I totally agree , but its the " underclass " that has the biggest problem with accents .
I have a fairly standard Cambridgeshire accent , but when im out in town each day , these people seem to take great joy in calling me names like toff , rich t*** etc even though i dont come from a wealthy background , just happen to want to speak english correctly .
I dont judge them by their accent or clothes , yet they do to me .
The problem is huge and there are 3 or 4 generations of people that have that chip on thier shoulder .
What is the solution !?
Dom , cambs
This is a very insightful and interesting article .
I was outraged when Big Brother Execs did not make a decision to intervene in the house , citing that the problem was not race related but rather to do with class .
When did it become OK to pick on someone because of their class ?
Its just as offensive and should not be tolerated .
Ambika Natarajan , Newcastle Upon Tyne
As always with Brian Walden , commonsense prevails .
An excellent article .
I consider that I had a working class upbringing , although many who know me would say I 'm middle class .
I 'm proud of my working class background but do n't feel constrained by it .
When it comes to other people I 'm more interested in what they 're like as an individual rather than what ' group ' they 're from .
Andy , Darlington
... and you think there are no class distinctions in the US ?
Think again as this is a very class divided country and is not just the haves and have nots .
Chris ( expat ) , Boston , USA
Every time there 's a debate on ' Have Your say ' , people pop up with the nastiest , most disgusting jokes about chavs .
If they made the same jokes about someone of colour , they'd be branded a racist , and rightly so , but because they 're making a joke about the ' working class ' ( which is what chavs are ) the jokes are not only seen as acceptable , but hysterically funny .
It 's a truely awful and divise prejudice , but no - one seems to see the harm , as it's based purely on social class .
MB , London
An interesting and thought - provoking piece .
The comments on accents I find particularly interesting , given what I 've found to be almost an obsession with labelling people based on where they 're from , often based on ( or supported by ) their accent .
SW , Caerphilly , Wales
Brian Walden 's article is one of the few intelligent things that I have read on this whole debate and he reflects my views entirely .
Racial and class prejudices were certainly demonstrated in Big Brother and this is sad and unacceptable , however that is true for all forms of aggressive and bullying behaviour .
When I read a comment such as Jade is a " stupid ignorant pig " I feel equally as disgusted as when I viewed Jade 's own aggressive behaviour .
These people who appear to be supporting Shilpa should take note of her dignified and understanding attitude .
Those who are crucifying Jade are no better than she is as this is bullying and scapegoating on the biggest scale .
More intelligent people such as Shilpa recognise that although they disagree with Jade 's aggressive outbursts , they are probably the result of her childhood experiences , which sound to be fairly tough , it seems that these have almost inevitably led to some resentment for those who have enjoyed a better upbringing , education and opportunities than herself .
None of us are immune from forming prejudices , the importance is that we are aware of them and try to approach all people with understanding .
This is what we are asking Jade to do and yet most of the people criticising her for her prejudices seem unaware that they are hypocrites .

Using Wikipedia , Technion researchers have developed a way to give computers knowledge of the world to help them â think smarter , â making common sense and broad - based connections between topics just as the human mind does .
The new method will help computers filter e-mail spam , perform Web searches and even conduct intelligence gathering at more sophisticated levels than current programs .
Researchers at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology have found a way to give computers encyclopedic knowledge of the world to help them â think smarter , â making common sense and broad - based connections between topics just as the human mind does .
The new method will help computers filter e-mail spam , perform Web searches and even conduct electronic intelligence gathering at a much more sophisticated level than current programs , according to researchers Evgeniy Gabrilovich and Shaul Markovitch of the Technion Faculty of Computer Science .
The findings will be presented next week in Hyderabad , India during the Twentieth International Joint Conference for Artificial Intelligence .
The program devised by the Technion researchers helps computers map single words and larger fragments of text to a database of concepts built from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia , which has over one million articles in its English - language version .
The Wikipedia - based concepts act as â background knowledge â to help computers figure out the meaning of the text entered into a Web search , for instance .
Giving computers this deeper knowledge has been a long - standing problem in artificial intelligence , according to Markovitch .
â Humans use a significant amount of background knowledge â to understand text , â but we did nât know how to have computers access such knowledge , â he said .
Most Web search and e-mail filter programs appear smart by calculating how often certain words appear in two texts , Markovitch explained .
â But what is common to all these applications is that the programs that actually do this kind of thing do nât understand text .
They treat text as a collection of words , but they do nât understand the meaning of words . â
This shallow understanding is what makes an e-mail spam filter block all messages containing the word â vitamin , â but fail to block messages containing the word â B12 . â â If the program never saw â B12 â before , it âs just a word without any meaning .
But you would know it âs a vitamin , â Markovitch said .
â With our methodology , however , the computer will use its Wikipedia - based knowledge base to infer that " B12 " is strongly associated with the concept of vitamins , and will correctly identify the message as spam , " he added .
Or , computers could look at a chunk of text about Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction and know that it is conceptually related to topics such as the Iraq war and U.S. Senate debates on intelligence â even if those terms do not appear anywhere in the original text .
The method also helps computers figure out ambiguous terms â deciding , for instance , whether the word â mouse â refers to the computer device or the fuzzy animal .
This can be especially important in translated documents , Markovitch said .
In the near future , the Technion researchers hope to improve their method by adding information from the Web page links inside Wikipedia articles .
They are already pursuing a patent on their work , which they say will be of interest to the intelligence community and Web search engine companies , among others .

Much of the money is heading in one direction , though : Iraq is becoming dependent on imports because industries here have been ravaged by the economic sanctions of the 1990s and the current sectarian violence .
Reconstruction and security have lagged so far behind the expectations of ordinary Iraqis that cheap goods from Iran and neighboring countries often provide the only comforts in their lives .
â What is happening in Iraq at the moment is a lot of trade , but it âs almost all one - way trade , â Barham Salih , the Iraqi deputy prime minister for finance , said of the country âs economic ties with Iran and other neighbors .
â If you take oil away , there âs a lot of imbalance in this . â
Iraqi leaders from the Shiite bloc currently in power say political and economic ties with Iran , which is governed by Shiite Persians , will inevitably strengthen .
As driving factors , they cite the hostility of Sunni Arab nations to a Shiite - run Iraq and the ambivalence of the White House toward the devout Shiite parties here .
â If the Shiites do not feel protected , if they feel what they âve achieved ca nât be maintained , much of the leadership will have to work with Iran , â said Sami al - Askari , a Shiite legislator who advises Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , himself a religious Shiite with close ties to Iran .
â The Arabs and the Americans are saying Iran is bad , but it âs the only recourse . â
According to one commonly cited statistic , trade between Iraq and Iran has grown by 30 percent a year since the 2003 invasion .
But American officials here say no accurate numbers are available because Iran refuses to release complete figures .

For decades now , the federal government has been hitting us in the wallet in order to subsidize the production of ethanol â alcohol derived from corn that is now being added to gasoline for a variety of reasons , which include claims that it is better for the environment than gasoline and helps to reduce American dependence on foreign oil .
But if you âre a boat owner , there âs a good chance you âve been feeling another big side - effect of these ethanol appropriations .
As in , your boat 's engine wo nât start .
At least that âs the case with me .
It âs bad enough that taxpayers are forced to help foot the bill for the production of ethanol , but if you âre like me , you just may be perversely funding the destruction of your own property as well .
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported the potentially devastating effects of ethanol on boat engines in an article back in August , explaining that the gasoline substitute can be most harmful to boats that have fiberglass fuel tanks and carbureted engines .
Specifically , " problems include erratic engine performance from water and contaminants trapped in boat fuel systems . "
According to the Mercury Marine website , the fuel - system components of its engines " will withstand up to 10 percent ethanol content in gasoline . "
However , even gasoline with this ethanol formulation has been found to cause a chemical reaction with fiberglass where resins are drawn out and carried into the engine ; it also tends to break down hoses and gaskets in motors that are not made with ethanol - compatible material , which leads to clogged fuel filters and carburetors , leaks , or engine damage .
I purchased a 2005 17 - foot Boston Whaler with a 90 - horsepower Mercury four - stroke outboard engine last summer , and this past August I had to have my carburetors repaired after only about 20 hours of use on the motor because it would n't start .
My wife and I wanted a boat that was relatively low - maintenance , one that would allow us to just get in it and go whenever we felt like it .
To the contrary , we could n't even get the engine started in November in order to pull the boat out of the water to winterize it .
That means that in only a few months time â and after running the gas line dry following each use since the carburetor work , per recommendation of the mechanic â the engine again failed to start .
Since my problems began , I 've discovered that Mercury 's 90 four - stroke motor , in particular , has been causing headaches for many other boat owners as well , which may indicate that this engine contains some design characteristics making it even more susceptible to ethanol issues than other motors happen to be .
Nevertheless , the point remains that ethanol is wreaking havoc for many boaters â havoc resulting from government regulations and incentives aimed at increasing the production and use of gasoline formulated with ethanol .
Worst of all â aside from coercive government mandates that impose all sorts of costs on citizens â there is evidence suggesting that this ethanol push is more or less intended to be one big handout for American corn farmers , and , by extension , ethanol manufacturers .
According to the non-partisan budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense , â the United States government has granted a multitude of tax incentives and subsidies to promote the growth of a domestic ethanol industry â since 1978 .
Indeed , the group claims that â ethanol has neither reduced dependence on foreign oil nor significantly helped to reduce pollution , â and that taxpayer subsidies â serve no other purpose than to artificially prop up the corn and ethanol industry . â
Journalist Robert Bryce has also written in Slate that ethanol will not reduce oil dependence ( as environmental and ethanol lobby groups like to claim ) , arguing that it will lead to higher gas prices , requires more fossil energy to produce than it actually contains , and provides only two - thirds the energy of gasoline .
According to Mr. Bryce , â Between 1995 and 2003 , federal corn subsidies totaled $ 37.3 billion . "
Incidentally , Bruce Stockman , director of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association , has accused Mercury Marine of having an â anti-ethanol agenda . â
I suppose I would too if the government was artificially increasing my costs and potentially helping to destroy my business by pushing fuels that damaged my product .
What is undeniable , however , is that Mr. Stockman most certainly has a pro-ethanol agenda .
The only difference , of course , is that Mercury is nât presently in business at the expense of American taxpayers .

The Best of Trevor Bothwell
The two best - known analyses of the war âs costs agree on this figure , but they diverge from there .
Linda Bilmes , at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard , and Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel laureate and former Clinton administration adviser , put a total price tag of more than $ 2 trillion on the war .
They include a number of indirect costs , like the economic stimulus that the war funds would have provided if they had been spent in this country .
Mr. Wallsten , who worked with Katrina Kosec , another economist , argues for a figure closer to $ 1 trillion in today âs dollars .
My own estimate falls on the conservative side , largely because it focuses on the actual money that Americans would have been able to spend in the absence of a war .
I did nât even attempt to put a monetary value on the more than 3,000 American deaths in the war .
Besides the direct military spending , I âm including the gas tax that the war has effectively imposed on American families ( to the benefit of oil - producing countries like Iran , Russia and Saudi Arabia ) .
At the start of 2003 , a barrel of oil was selling for $ 30 .
Since then , the average price has been about $ 50 .
Attributing even $ 5 of this difference to the conflict adds another $ 150 billion to the war âs price tag , Ms. Bilmes and Mr. Stiglitz say .
The war has also guaranteed some big future expenses .
Replacing the hardware used in Iraq and otherwise getting the United States military back into its prewar fighting shape could cost $ 100 billion .
And if this war âs veterans receive disability payments and medical care at the same rate as veterans of the first gulf war , their health costs will add up to $ 250 billion .
If the disability rate matches Vietnam âs , the number climbs higher .
Either way , Ms. Bilmes says , â It âs like a miniature Medicare . â
In economic terms , you can think of these medical costs as the difference between how productive the soldiers would have been as , say , computer programmers or firefighters and how productive they will be as wounded veterans .
In human terms , you can think of soldiers like Jason Poole , a young corporal profiled in The New York Times last year .
Before the war , he had planned to be a teacher .
After being hit by a roadside bomb in 2004 , he spent hundreds of hours learning to walk and talk again , and he now splits his time between a community college and a hospital in Northern California .
Whatever number you use for the war âs total cost , it will tower over costs that normally seem prohibitive .
Right now , including everything , the war is costing about $ 200 billion a year .
Treating heart disease and diabetes , by contrast , would probably cost about $ 50 billion a year .
The remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations â held up in Congress partly because of their cost â might cost somewhat less .
Universal preschool would be $ 35 billion .
In Afghanistan , $ 10 billion could make a real difference .
At the National Cancer Institute , annual budget is about $ 6 billion .
The average driver should never need to think about tactical driving , but there is the rare occasion that it will become a necessity .
More so , those in law enforcement may find tactical driving a life saving skill , or an ability which will help catch the â bad guy â .
This tutorial covers some of the basics of skills and maneuvers which tend to be considered tactical driving , but may even be useful during an extreme situation such as avoiding an accident .
While reading this article may give you the knowledge about driving a car in certain situations , actually performing the skills will prove to be very different than just reading about them .
The maneuvers should be practiced and perfected before attempting to do them in a situation which requires flawless execution under stressed conditions .
Some of the things mentioned in the tutorial may be illegal on public streets and should never be practiced or performed there unless it is absolutely necessary .

What an amazing bloody catastrophe .
The Bush administration 's policy towards the Middle East over the five years since 9/11 is culminating in a multiple train crash .
Never in the field of human conflict was so little achieved by so great a country at such vast expense .
In every vital area of the wider Middle East , American policy over the last five years has taken a bad situation and made it worse .
If the consequences were not so serious , one would have to laugh at a failure of such heroic proportions - rather in the spirit of Zorba the Greek who , contemplating the splintered ruins of his great project , memorably exclaimed : " Did you ever see a more splendiferous crash ? "
But the reckless incompetence of Zorba the Bush has resulted in the death , maiming , uprooting or impoverishment of hundreds of thousands of men , women and children - mainly Muslim Arabs but also Christian Lebanese , Israelis and American and British soldiers .
By contributing to a broader alienation of Muslims it has also helped to make a world in which , as we walk the streets of London , Madrid , Jerusalem , New York or Sydney , we are all , each and every one of us , less safe .
Laugh if you dare .
In the beginning , there were the 9/11 attacks .
It 's important to stress that no one can fairly blame George Bush for them .
The invasion of Afghanistan was a justified response to those attacks , which were initiated by al - Qaida from its bases in a rogue state under the tyranny of the Taliban .
But if Afghanistan had to be done , it had to be done properly .
It was n't .
Creating a half - way civilised order in one of the most rugged , inhospitable and tribally recalcitrant places on the planet was always going to be a huge challenge .
If the available resources of the world 's democracies , including those of a new , enlarged Nato , had been dedicated to that task over the last five years , we might at least have one partial success to report today .
Instead Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld drove us on to Iraq , aided and abetted by Tony Blair , leaving the job in Afghanistan less than half - done .
Today Osama bin Laden and his henchmen are probably still holed up in the mountains of Waziristan , just across the Afghan frontier in northern Pakistan , while the Taliban is back in force and the whole country is a bloody mess .
Instead of one partial success , following a legitimate intervention , we have two burgeoning disasters , in Afghanistan and in Iraq .
The United States and Britain invaded Iraq under false pretences , without proper legal authority or international legitimacy .
If Saddam Hussein , a dangerous tyrant and certified international aggressor , had in fact possessed secret stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , the intervention might have been justified ; as he did n't , it was n't .
Then , through the breathtaking incompetence of the civilian armchair warriors in the Pentagon and the White House , we transformed a totalitarian state into a state of anarchy .
Claiming to move Iraq forward towards Lockean liberty , we hurled it back to a Hobbesian state of nature .
Iraqis - those who have not been killed - increasingly say things are worse than they were before .
Who are we to tell them they are wrong ?
Now we are preparing to get out .
After working through Basra in Operation Sinbad , a reduced number of British troops will draw back to their base at Basra airfield .
We will sit in a desert and call it peace .
If the White House follows the Baker - Hamilton commission 's advice , US troops will do something similar , leaving embedded advisers with Iraqi forces .
Three decades ago , American retreat was cloaked by " Vietnamisation " ; now it will be cloaked by Iraqisation .
Meanwhile , Iraqis can go on killing each other all around , until perhaps , in the end , they cut some rough - and - ready political deals between themselves - or not , as the case may be .
The theocratic dictatorship of Iran is the great winner .
Five years ago , the Islamic republic had a reformist president , a substantial democratic opposition , and straitened finances because of low oil prices .
The mullahs were running scared .
Now the prospects of democratisation are dwindling , the regime is riding high on oil at more than $ 60 a barrel , and it has huge influence through its Shia brethren in Iraq and Lebanon .
The likelihood of it developing nuclear weapons is correspondingly greater .
We toppled the Iraqi dictator , who did not have weapons of mass destruction , and thereby increased the chances of Iran 's dictators acquiring weapons of mass destruction .
And this week Iran 's President Ahmadinejad once again called for the destruction of the state of Israel .
Those American neocons who set out to make the Middle East safe for Israel have ended up making it more dangerous for Israel .
We did not need an Iraq Study Group to tell us that resolving the Arab - Israeli conflict through a two - state solution for Israel and Palestine is crucial .
In its last months the Clinton administration came close to clinching the deal .
Under Bush , things have gone backwards .
Even the Bush - backed Ariel Sharon scenario of separation through faits accomplis has receded , with the summer war in Lebanon , Hamas ascendancy in Palestine ( itself partly a by - product of the Bush - led rush to elections ) , and a growing disillusionment of the Israeli public .
Having scored an apparent success with the " cedar revolution " in Lebanon and the withdrawal of Syrian troops , the Bush administration , by its tacit support of sustained yet ineffective Israeli military action this summer , undermined the very Lebanese government it was claiming to support .
Now Hizbullah is challenging the country 's western - backed velvet revolutionaries at their own game : after the cedar revolution , welcome to the cedar counter - revolution .
In Egypt , supposedly a showcase for the United States ' support for peaceful democratisation in the Bush second term , electoral success for Islamists ( as in Palestine and Lebanon ) seems to have frightened Washington away from its fresh - minted policy before the ink was even dry .
On the credit side , all we have to show is Libya 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction , and a few tentative reforms in some smaller Arab states .
So here 's the scoresheet for Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran , Israel , Palestine , Lebanon and Egypt : worse , worse , worse , worse , worse , worse and worse .
With James Baker , the United States may revert from the sins of the son to the sins of the father .
After all , it was Baker and George Bush
Sr who left those they had encouraged to rise up against Saddam to be killed in Iraq at the end of the first Gulf war - not to mention enthusiastically continuing Washington 's long - running Faustian pact with petro-autocracies such as Saudi Arabia .
I 'm told that Condoleezza Rice , no less , has wryly observed that the word democracy hardly features in the Baker - Hamilton report .
Many a time , in these pages and elsewhere , I have warned against reflex Bush - bashing and kneejerk anti-Americanism .
The United States is by no means the only culprit .
Changing the Middle East for the better is one of the most difficult challenges in world politics .
The people of the region bear much responsibility for their own plight .
So do we Europeans , for past sins of commission and current sins of omission .
But Bush must take the lion 's share of the blame .
There are few examples in recent history of such a comprehensive failure .
Congratulations , Mr President ; you have made one hell of a disaster .

Hitch 's assault on Ralph " Tinkerbell " Reed for his ties to Abramoff alone make this an instant classic .
It 's astounding to hear Sean Hannity -- the King of demonizing people for single instances of perceived transgressions ( for which they apologize profusely -- see : Sen. Byrd , Dick Durbin , John Kerry etc. ) -- dismiss away Falwell 's long record of hateful comments .

Last week , facing enormous opposition , the White House pulled the nomination of controversial Swift Boat campaign funder , Sam Fox , to be Ambassador to Belgium .
Today , in a direct rebuke to America 's veterans who served in Vietnam unlike Bush and Cheney , Bush used a " recess appointment " to avoid Senate confirmation and gave
Fox the job anyway :
President Bush named Republican fundraiser Sam Fox as U.S. ambassador to Belgium on Wednesday , using a maneuver that allowed him to bypass Congress where Democrats had derailed Fox 's nomination .
Democrats had denounced Fox for his 2004 donation to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
The group 's TV ads , which claimed that Sen .
John Kerry exaggerated his military record in Vietnam , were viewed as a major factor in the Massachusetts Democrat losing the election .
Recognizing
Fox did not have the votes to obtain Senate confirmation , Bush withdrew the nomination last month .
On Wednesday , with Congress out of town for a spring break , the president used his power to make recess appointments to put Fox in the job without Senate confirmation .
This means
Fox can remain ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress , effectively through the end of the Bush presidency .
Bush is the first one to play games to avoid the normal procedure when he 's going to lose .
The Senate should cut funding for the embassy in Belgium .

Anyway , last night was typical of the past few weeks ... was awoken around 1:00 a.m. ( I get up at 6 ) by the sound of what , in my half asleep state , sounded like some sort of bomb about to go off in my closet .
Not long after this split second of subliminally injected Code Orange Terror ( and I âm politically somewhere left of a bed wetting liberal â thanks G.W. )
I realized that some serious primal fucking was going on .
I also realized that the most exciting thing going on in my room was that I finally got a space heater â sweet !
But definitely not sexy .
When they were finally finished they turned on their television which happened to be airing a WWII documentary .
I never ever thought the sounds of a country being decimated by bombing and heavy artillery shelling would be soothing music to my ears , but at least I did not have to listen to Churchill yelling , â Oh yeah , oh baby , look at you now ! "
I finally fell asleep somewhere around V - E Day .
So , I need someone , male or female , to come hang out with me in my room and simulate the sound of two people having wild sex .
This does not have to be constant , after all I âm aiming for something realistic , so in between our bouts of faux fucking we can watch a movie , have a beer , do each others nails and warm ourselves by the space heater .
Thanks .*** me - 5 ' 3 " , 110 lbs , brown / blue / yellow ( ear plugs ) .
I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think IÃ¢â¬â¢ve met many people who wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t want a body like Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt .
However , people like this are generally born with good genes , which gives them their spectacular bodies .
Because they are in the public eye they are also going to make the most of what they have and they do this by going to the gym and working their butts off and by eating a sensible diet .
It seems to almost be the norm for celebrities today to strip off and flaunt their bodies in the media .
Have you ever wished you could do the same but you know that if you took your clothes off most people would run a mile ?
And why not , if you stand naked in front of your mirror and only see this
Rounded shoulders
Sagging boobs ( men and women alike )
Folds of unsightly fat around the middle
Dimply low hanging backside
Fat wobbly thighs
Well you and only you hold the answer to these problems .
Think about your body more and treat it well .
You simply must start to tone your muscles by doing the correct exercises .
You must take care to watch what you eat .
Stand tall and stop hiding beneath all those clothes .
Imagine when you walk down the street that you are naked and thereÃ¢â¬â¢s nowhere to hide .
WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s the first thing you should do ?
Yes , stand tall and upright .
This will immediately create a longer leaner body .
Secondly , hold your stomach in and stride out with confidence .
Ok , this is unlikely to happen , but what you can do is to imagine it happening and you will start to become more aware of your body and hopefully take control .
ItÃ¢â¬â¢s so so easy to let yourself go , easy to eat that extra cake , easy to slouch with our shoulders rounded , easy to watch the telly instead of going for a walk .

Ghost bikes are typically old bicycles painted white and placed where bicyclists have died .
Plaques identify the dead .
The memorials are the work of Time âs Up ! , an advocacy group , and Visual Resistance , a group of Brooklyn artists and activists .
Inspired by similar campaigns in St. Louis and Pittsburgh , the two organizations have erected more than 20 such memorials .
It âs been a long week .
After almost a year at Google , our team finally released our new service to the world at OSCON this week in Portland .
Of course , I did nât actually get to attend the conference ; I spent four days holed up in a smelly hotel room with three other team - mates , trying to prepare for public launch .
This lovely photo shows us like the caged animals we are .
My co-worker Fitz and I did manage to escape the hotel room twice to present two talks .
We âve been working together so long now that we can actually finish each other âs sentences , so we âve turned this abliity into a presentation gimmick .
We stand in front of crowds each holding a microphone , riffing on slide bullets back and forth .
I âm not sure if it âs comedic or just novel , but we get really great feedback .
One blogger did an amazing writeup of our first talk , and another blogger practically republished the slides of our second talk .
A third blogger said that our first talk was the â best session of the day â .
Woo !
In any case , the real news is our product announcement .
Long ago I made post describing What I Do at Google .
Namely , I work on the Open Source team , whose mission is to promote open source software development however we can : create more of it , and make it better .
Working for a large company like Google , we have two main resources : ( 1 ) money , and ( 2 ) a massive data - serving infrastructure .
Given these resources , how can we accomplish our mission ?
Our team has been using money in a few ways .
We make financial donations to important open source projects , and sometimes even pay people to work full - time on them .
We also fund the hugely successful Summer of Code program , which pays hundreds students to work on open source software as â virtual summer internship â ; the result is not only accelerated open source development across the board , but a whole new generation of open source programmers .
But it âs the massive data - serving infrastructure that we âve not really used much â until now .
Our big product announcement was Open Source Project Hosting on our team âs main website , code.google.com .
You can read all the gritty details in our FAQ , and there are many blogs and news posts that talk about our new service , as well as folks posting screen shots .
The general jist of the service is : come to our site and create an open source project .
There âs no approval process .
Within a few seconds , your project is ready to go .
You get a super - simple front page which describes your project , an issue tracker , and a Subversion repository to store your source code .
No , this is not a new concept .
There are many project - hosting sites out there such as Sourceforge and Tigris .
Our intent is nât to compete directly with these sites , but rather to provide more options to open source developers ; we feel that we âve got a fresh new take on project hosting , and we âre excited to see how developers make use of it .
Following the motto on our front page , we âve â released early â ( our service is admittedly quite spartan right now ) but also plan to â release often â â there are a whole slew of new features planned over the next several months .
Let me draw your attention to the two main features we âre providing at launch .
The issue tracker ( written by a team - mate of mine ) is unlike any I âve ever seen .
Like many Google products , it âs extremely fast and AJAX-y , has cool customizable views , and has a simple Gmail - like interface .
Instead of forcing users to fill out myriads of fields , the issue entry is simple and uncluttered .
Developers can invent any sort of arbitrary â labels â to describe an issue , much like Gmail labels .
The issue tracker then uses Google search technology to search over all of the data in a free - form fashion .
There âs just one search box .
I really think it âs a whole new approach to issue tracking applications , and we hope it âs useful to open source developers .
However , the thing which I âve been working on for the last ten months ( with Fitz ) is the Subversion hosting feature .
A typical Subversion repository has two different back - end options for storing your code : either a Berkeley DB database or a FSFS ( flat filesystem ) store .
What Fitz and I have done is write a new Google - specific back - end which stores the code in our datacenters , specifically in an internal technology called Bigtable .
Jeff Dean ( another Googler ) has given public presentations about Bigtable , and you can read more about this technology by Googling for it .
It âs much like a gigantic spreadsheet for holding data , but it can run over thousands of machines spread over mulitple datacenters .
So just like other Google services ( picasaweb , Gmail , Calendar , etc. ) , your data gets put into a massively scalable , redundant , and reliable system .
I know that in the past , I âve been personally frustrated when my own Subversion server goes down ; it can be a lot of work to manage your own repository .
Instead of being distracted with that , let Google Code be your free host , and get on with coding !
I know that some of my closer friends may wonder if I âve turned to the Dark Side .
Are nât I the same guy who worked on open - source Subversion for five years ?
Who wrote a free book about Subversion ?
Why have I spent time all this time writing a proprietary (! ) extension to an open source system ?
My answer is that it âs all about seeing the forest through the trees .
Yes , I wish that our new Subversion back - end were open - sourceable , but it âs not a realistic possibility .
Google has amazing hardware and a complex mountain of software to make use of it effectively , but it âs all one proprietary ecosystem .
Releasing this new Subversion back - end as open source would be meaningless , since it âs not something that can function outside of Google .
That said , the point here is the larger , longer - term benefit : by providing free , highly - available Subversion repositories to the world at large , we open to â embiggen â open source everywhere .
( Yes , that âs the word used by my team leader , Chris DiBona ) . ð
To technical friends : I hope this post has been enlightening .
To my nontechnical friends and family : hope that was nât too much babble !
Documents show new secretive US prison program isolating Muslim , Middle Eastern prisoners Jennifer Van Bergen
Published : Friday February 16 , 2007 Print This Email This Sponsored by : The Agenda with Joe Solmonese Program in apparent violation of federal law The US Department of Justice has implemented a secretive new prison program segregating " high - security - risk " Muslim and Middle Eastern prisoners and tightly restricting their communications with the outside world in apparent violation of federal law , according to documents obtained by RAW STORY .
Quietly implemented in December , the special " Communications Management Unit " ( CMU ) at a federal penitentiary in Indiana targeting Muslim and Middle - Eastern inmates was not implemented through the process required by federal law , which stipulates the public be notified of any new changes to prison programs and be given the opportunity to voice objections .
Instead , the program appears to have been ordered and implemented by a senior official at the Department of Justice .
In April of last year , the US Federal Bureau of Prisons -- part of the Department of Justice -- proposed a set of strict new regulations and , as required , there was a period of public comment .
Human rights and civil liberties groups voiced strong concerns about the constitutionality of the proposed program .
The program originally proposed was said to be applicable only to terrorists and terrorist - related criminals .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , however , along with a coalition of other civil liberties groups , objected to the language of the regulation as too broad , and potentially applicable to non-terrorists and even to those not convicted of a crime but merely being held as " witnesses , detainees , or otherwise . "
After pushback from civil rights groups , the program appeared to have been dropped by the Prisons Bureau , with coalition groups believing that they had made their case regarding Constitutional rights .
Yet documents obtained by RAW STORY show that a similar program , the CMU , was surreptitiously implemented in December 2006 .
Executive Director Howard Kieffer of Federal Defense Associates , a legal group based in California that assists inmates and lawyers of inmates on post - conviction defense matters , says the order for the program must have been issued by one of the offices which oversee the US Federal Bureau of Prisons .
Only three government offices have the authority to issue such changes in federal prison operations , and they all fall within the senior management of the Justice Department : the office of Harley Lappin , the Director of Prisons Bureau , the Office of Legal Counsel , or directly from the office of the US Attorney General , Alberto Gonzales .
The Public Affairs offices of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General referred all requests for comment to the Prisons Bureau .
As of press time , Felice Ponce , an officer in the Prisons Bureau Office of Information , was unable to answer requests to confirm the existence of the program , provide details about it , or comment on it at all .
Those who had such information at the Bureau were all " out of pocket , " Ponce said .
Documents obtained by RAW STORY show that the CMU program , instituted Dec. 11 , 2006 -- shortly after the mid-term elections in which Democrats won both chambers of Congress -- is being implemented at Terre Haute Federal Correctional Institution in Indiana .
Under the CMU program , telephone communications must be conducted using monitored phone lines , be live - monitored by staff , are subject to recording , and must be in English only .
All letters must be reviewed by staff prior to delivery or sending .
Visits must be non-contact only , live - monitored , and subject to recording in English .
Keiffer asserts that the program , which purports to house high - risk inmates for the purpose of better monitoring their communications , " is not related to inmate security " at all .
The program " does n't affect the highest security inmates who are still being kept in other high security prisons , where some may be allowed greater freedom in communications than the CMU inmates , " he says .
" It affects a class of inmates who would not garner as much sympathy as others and who have diminished support in the US . "
" It is just like the detentions after 9/11 , " he adds .
" It 's profiling . "
Calls placed to the FBI were not returned .
The CMU is in apparent violation of the Federal Administrative Procedures Act , which explicitly requires that all prison regulations be promulgated under that law .
Courts have overturned programs that have violated this law " half a dozen times over the past ten years , " Keiffer says .
One of the documents obtained by RAW STORY , titled " Institution Supplement , " was issued by the Terre Haute facility and given to prisoners transferred into this new program .
The document states that " all contact " between the inmates and " persons in the community " may only occur " according to national policy , with necessary adjustments indicated herein , " indicating that the new program 's contact rules are the same as normal prison rules except where " adjusted " in the Supplement .
Attorney Peter Goldberger , a Philadelphia - area specialist in criminal appeals and former law professor who has 30 years experience dealing with federal prisons and inmates , told RAW STORY that the Terre Haute Institution Supplement is officially a supplement to the Prison Bureau 's national Program Statement on Inmate Discipline and Special Housing Units , published in the Code of Federal Regulations and last amended in 2003 .
Keiffer explains that an Institution Supplement cannot exist by itself without specific authorization .
The CMU Institution Supplement states that it is " according to national policy . "
But Keiffer notes that the national Program Statement does not in fact authorize the CMU program .
In order for the program to be properly authorized , it would have to address the particular program parameters , locations , specify the inmates to whom it applied , and would have to take into account the specific and unique features of that program .
The already existing national Program Statement does not address the CMU program and thus does not authorize it .
Goldberger notes that " what 's different " about the program , " is limitation of contact with friends , family and outsiders -- instead of 300 minutes of telephone time per month , it 's one 15 minute call per week , which can be reduced in the Warden 's discretion to a mere three minutes once a month . "
" Instead of all - day visiting every week or every other week , it 's only two hours at a time , twice a month , with no physical contact , presumably sitting on opposite sides of a plexiglas window , " Goldberger continued .
" And all letters , except to lawyers , courts , and Congress , will be read and copied , with weeks of delay , instead of cursorily inspected and sent right on , " he adds .
" It 's a totally new and different program . "
Director of the Center for National Security Studies in Washington , D.C. Kate Martin told RAW STORY that restrictions of inmate communications must be narrowly tailored to serve a specific identifiable need of the government .
Martin said that there was a clear rationale for restricting communications of those who had previously handled classified information -- for example a former CIA agent who had passed secrets to a foreign government .
But with individuals who never possessed classified information , she said , that rationale does n't exist .
The government must show that the inmates had been plotting terrorist crimes from their cells or some similar scenario , Martin said .
Without that , the restriction of communication of a group of prisoners raises a suspicion that it is actually an effort by the government to deny information to the press and public about what it is doing .
Who 's in the program ?
The federal penitentiary where the most dangerous criminals are held , including the Unabomber and the Millennium Bomber , is the maximum security prison known as ADMax at Florence , Colorado .
The CMU is not being implemented there , however ; instead it is being implemented in Terre Haute Federal Correctional Institution in Indiana .
The CMU is said to be targeting terrorists or suspected terrorists , but many being held are not considered high risk or even convicted of violent crimes .
According to a letter obtained by RAW STORY , sent by CMU inmate Dr. Rafil Dhafir to one of his supporters , the current unit has at present only 16 prisoners , but is expected to have 60 - 70 more added soon .
Dhafir writes that the CMU " is still not fully understood .
The staff here is struggling to make sense of the whole situation , " and says that the prisoners are " so far treated with great respect and good accommodation " but " with the new system we will have absolutely no privacy . "
The letter has been posted on a support site for Dhafir .
Dr. Dhafir was convicted for violating US sanctions against Iraq , because he had sent humanitarian aid to the country during the restricted period .
Dhafir was not charged with any terrorism related activities or a violent offense .
Also in CMU detention are also five of the " Lackawanna Six , " a group of six American citizens who traveled to Afghanistan before Sept. 11 , 2001 and were indicted for giving material support to Al Qaeda .
Yahya Goba , one of the group 's members -- who turns up as a government witness in numerous cases -- is not in the system , although he was sentenced to ten years along with the other Lackawanna defendants .
Unconstitutional ?
Howard Keiffer believes that the program not only violates federal law but the Constitution as well , saying it abridges the prisoners ' right to freedom of expression and association .
These inmates are " not able to communicate like other inmates , " he said .
James Landrith , Jr. , who heads " The Multiracial Activist , " an on - line journal that covers social and civil liberties issues relating to multi-racialism , says the new program sets a " very , very bad precedent . "
Landrith says it's " interesting that this administration is trying to push these things through covertly " -- things he views as unconstitutional restrictions -- " while you have a sitting Vice President who could be charged in the short - term future with having been involved in outing a CIA agent . "
He added that the program " makes it very very hard for someone to mount a real defense or appeal when they can't talk to anyone on the outside . "
Some say the program smacks of racial or religious profiling .
Paul Wright , the editor of Prison Legal News , told RAW STORY that " segregating prisoners based on their race , national origin or language directly contradicts the recent US supreme court ruling in Johnson v. California which held that the racial segregation of prisoners was illegal . "
Johnson v. California , a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision , involved the segregation of African - American inmates .
While the Court noted in its decision that it did not decide whether the segregation violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution , it nonetheless " explicitly reaffirm[ed ] that the ' necessities of prison security and discipline , ' are a compelling government interest justifying only those uses of race that are narrowly tailored to address those necessities . "
Race , national or ethnic origin , one 's status as an alien , or any innate or immutable characteristic that a person has no power to change must be scrutinized by courts under the same standard : only a compelling government interest and a narrowly tailored program is held to be constitutional .
Religious discrimination is prohibited by Prison Bureau regulations .
The regulation states that Bureau " staff shall not discriminate against inmates on the basis of race , religion , national origin , sex , disability , or political belief .
This includes the making of administrative decisions and providing access to work , housing and programs . "
Director of the Human and Civil Rights Division of the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation Ibrahim Ramey says his group is " deeply concerned about the violation of civil rights of incarcerated Muslims " who are targeted by the program .
" The removal and concentration of Muslims " Ramey says , is a " violation of the concept of innocent until proven guilty . "
Though the inmates have been convicted , Ramey believes the CMU appears to be " a precursor to a program of segregation of people by religion in federal detention facilities . "
" You do n't segregate all Jews or all Christians , " he adds .
Most of RAW STORY 's calls and emails to inmates ' attorneys or former attorneys were not returned .
Several refused to comment .
One attorney who represented one of the inmates at trial commented that " the new facility creates hardships for the family because of the distance and restrictions on visitation and phone use , but overall the staff are treating the inmates very well ; they are very professional in their handling of the inmates . "

Officials say GPS data shows the personnel were in Iraqi waters
MoD news briefing
Vice Admiral Charles Style said the sailors had been " ambushed " in the Gulf after searching a vessel and their detention was " unjustified and wrong " .
Tony Blair said it was time to " ratchet up " pressure on Iran , with whom the UK has now suspended bilateral contacts .
Reports suggest the only woman among the group will be freed shortly .
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman is quoted as saying Faye Turney , 26 , would be released either later on Wednesday or on Thursday .
Iran has insisted the group were in its waters when they were taken last Friday .
The eight sailors and seven marines , based on HMS Cornwall , which has its home port in Plymouth , were taken at gunpoint by Iranian Revolutionary Guards after they had searched a merchant vessel .
UK VERSION OF EVENTS 1 Crew boards merchant ship 1.7NM inside Iraqi waters
2 HMS Cornwall was south - east of this , and inside Iraqi waters
3 Iran tells UK that merchant ship was at a different point , still within Iraqi waters
4 After UK points this out , Iran provides alternative position , now within Iranian waters
UK version in more detail
Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki told Turkey 's CNN - Turk television the 15 - thought to be at the guards ' base in Tehran - were in " completely good health " .
Iran 's embassy in London also issued a statement in response to the UK data , in which it said the sailors and marines had been 0.5 km inside Iranian waters at the time they were seized .
The statement , quoted by the official IRNA news agency , said " the governments of Iran and Britain have the ability to solve the incident through contacts and close co-operation " .
At a briefing in London , the Ministry of Defence said it " unambiguously contested " Iran 's claims that the Royal Navy personnel had strayed into Iranian waters .
Speaking later , Mr Blair told MPs it was time to increase pressure on Iran " in order to make sure the Iranian government understands their total isolation on this issue " .
The seizure of the personnel was " unacceptable , wrong and illegal " and the UK was now in talks with all its key allies and partners , he said .

Mr Blair added : " Our thoughts are with the servicemen and the servicewoman and their families , and their safe return is our paramount concern . "
The prime minister said : " These personnel were patrolling in Iraqi waters under a United Nations mandate .
Their boarding and checking of the Indian merchant vessel was routine - there was no justification therefore for their detention . "
Mr Blair said the personnel had been " doing their job " and the government would be talking to international partners in Nato and the UN to reach a " sensible " solution .
The UK government said the Iranians initially said the merchant vessel searched by the navy personnel had been at a point within Iraqi waters , before later providing a second , alternative position , within Iranian waters .
In a statement to the Commons , Mrs Beckett said : " We find it impossible to believe , given the seriousness of the incident , that the Iranians could have made such a mistake with the original coordinates . "
She told MPs that Britain were suspending bilateral contacts with Iran until the navy personnel were released .

Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " The seizure of our personnel was clearly unjustified and the evidence the foreign secretary and the MoD has presented shatters the credibility of any claim they were operating in Iranian waters . "
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the freeze on ties between the two countries meant that until the Britons were returned there would be " no inward or outward visits to Iran " and no UK visas would be granted to Iranian officials .
Fire engines and police cars sealed off the embassy
The rocket , fired from street level into the front of the embassy , caused minor damage to the building but no - one was injured .
The US envoy condemned the " very serious attack " , as fire engines and police cordoned off the area .
Greece 's Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras said it was " very likely " a domestic group was behind the attack .
He said police were investigating claims that a left - wing radical group , Revolutionary Struggle , was responsible .
' Windows shattered '
The blast was reported in the early morning at the embassy , which is on one of the main boulevards in Athens .
Police said a rocket was fired at the US eagle emblem at the front of the building .
" A self - propelled explosive was fired at 0558 ( 0358 GMT ) from the surrounding area , causing minor damage to the front windows and the roof , " a statement from the Greek public order ministry said .
The rocket landed in a toilet on the third floor of the building , which also houses Ambassador Charles Ries 's office .
" I am treating this as a very serious attack , " Mr Ries said .
" The embassy was attacked in a senseless act of violence . "
Mr Ries said the reliability of any claims of responsibility would have to be assessed .
Television pictures showed a mass of emergency vehicles and stationary traffic outside the embassy as the area was sealed off .
Left - wing groups
The US embassy is one of the most fortified and tightly guarded buildings in the region and is frequently the target of protests in a country brimming with potent anti-Americanism , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens .
In February 1996 , it suffered minor damage when unknown attackers - thought to be leftist radicals - fired a rocket at it .
In the past , the far - left November 17 group - now disbanded and whose leaders were jailed in 2003 - attacked Greek , US and other foreign targets , killing more than 20 people .
Revolutionary Struggle - a group which emerged after November 17 disintegrated - is regarded by security experts as Greece 's most active terrorist group , our correspondent says .
It has broadly the same left - wing , anarchic anti-capitalist agenda as November 17 and vigorously opposes America 's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as the economic and social policies of the current conservative Greek government .
It has carried out a number of bombings and attacks in recent years .
< Routine Episodes >
I have advocated that we pick routine subjects for haiku .
For that matter , I have an unforgettable episode , which I want to share with my readers .
Please bear with me for a little digression .
In the morning we spread the newspaper and scan through accidents and affaits of human life all of which we think are totally unrelated or at best very remote to us .
To those of us , ordinary citizens , who live a peaceful , quiet routine life , those reported affairs look as remote as accidents to strangers in another world .
Should they happen in our neighborhood , they still remain unnoticed until they really involve us personally .
Winter is the season for tasteful blow fish ( " fugu " ) dishes .
Haiku trips often take me to Kyushu and Yamaguchi prefectures and feast of fugu dishes .
I remember the impressive taste of sashimi or thin sliced pieces of raw meat so transparent that decorative patterns on the dish showed through .
Concern about the fish poison was not serious enough to spoil my fugu taste .
It was some 10 years ago , I guess .
Four friendly couples of us decided to go to a highly reputable fugu restaurant in Kobe .
One cold day towerd end of January , perhaps the last occasion for the fugu season , I left home with exciting anticipation of a pleasant gathering abd chat over fugu meal .
All those familiar face naturally filled the tatami room with a warm and joyful atmosphere .
Presently came impressive arrays of thin sliced fugu sashimi on the plates accompanied by hot Japanese sake with a fish fin dipped .
After a while , two pans of water for fugu cooking began to boil with steam filling the entire room .
A young cook , apparently under apprenticeship , served fish neat and others in the boiling water .
Then he picked up some light brown soft stuff from another plate .
I asked , " Is that a fugu liver ? "
He replied yes .
" Is that all right ? " " Sure , all right . "
As he tried to serve a boiled piece of liver in my dish , I said , " I 'm not Sure it 's all right .
Maybe I should pass . "
I turned down the offer as I had not tried liver before while I always enjoyed fugu sashimi .
" Let me have yours , then . " a man volunteered from the other side of the table , I tried to hand over my share to him , then the young cook warned , " a piece only per person .
Please donlt give yours to others beyond prescription . "
" Maybe , that 's the fatal dose . " people laughingly joked for a while and their as8luring remarks eased my stubborn reluctance .
I timidly ate a piece of fugu liver for the first time inmy life while all my friends closely watched me !
" My lips are hot and burn , " I said .
" It 's because of spices , " they assured me and laughed .
After the fugu dinner , we dropped in at another place and came home together : we decided to take advantage of the occasion and play mah - jong .
Approximately four hours had passed after the fugu meal - I was not the only person who felt numb on finger tips .
" Probably we ate poison today , " someone said .
" My finger tips wo n't hold a piece of mah - jong , " someone else joined .
We all felt something out of ordinary but nobody took the matter seriously .
The mah - jong was over and I tried to rise for the guest 's belongings upstairs .
I fell on my hip before I knew .
" What on earth is the natter ? " I wondered , but managed , while feeling ny body numb , to go upstairs and get back to my guests .
" I feel dizzy , " someone said .
" Something i8 Strange , " others uttered and they all left .
I felt too sick to put things away .
" sorry but let me go to bed , " I excused myself and rose to go to ny bedroom upstairs , then I suddenly felt like vomitting .
My stomach by then was empty and left me in sheer agony .
I felt dizzy and crawled on all fours to the bed .
I was barely aware of a phone persistently ringing downstairs , then someone answered .
Presently I heard approaching steps on the stairway and my sister reported , " The fugu restaurant you visited today says that some customers were poisoned today , and that they found a bad fugu fish Was served to your party and wonder if you are all okay . "
She continued , " They suggest that you go to hospital right away if you feel sick .
Your guests are all on their way to hospital .
What would you do ? "
" What else could I do but lie in bed .
I would hardly survive the cold outside .
Better in bed , I think . "
" I see , " she said and went downstairs for the waiting phone .
I felt my whole body .
in sickening rotation whether I opened or closed my eyes .
I felt pressures on the breast and hard to breathe .
I called for my husband .
who would not wake up .
Our eldest son , then a primary school student , woke to help me .
I asked him to bring me certain medicine for heart , which helped soothe the ailing condition and gave me some sleep .
I remember joking under all such agonies , " If I should die , take 48 hours before you bury me .
You may come to life again when poisoned by fugu . "
I learned to my bitter experience that one would hardly relate one 's own sickness to death .
My poisoned sickness lasted for good three days and nights .
The docter came for camphor injections and said that I would have to wait for natural recovery .
After all , none of us died or appeared in the newspapers .
When I read articles reporting death due to fugh poison including the case of Bando Mitsugoro , famous Kabuki actor I always remember the agonizing sick feeling .

Paul Krugman made similar points about new York :
Cities Shed Middle Class , and Are Richer and Poorer for It , by Janny Scott , NY Times : Some big American cities are flourishing as at no time in recent memory .
Places like New York and San Francisco appear to be richer and more dazzling than ever : crime remains low , new arrivals pour in , neighborhoods have risen from the dead .
...
But middle - class city dwellers across the country are being squeezed .
[ T ] hey are ... a casualty of high housing costs and the thinning out of the country âs once broad economic middle .
The percentage of middle - income neighborhoods in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles , Chicago and Washington has dropped since 1970 , according to a recent Brookings Institution report .
The percentage of higher - income neighborhoods in many places has gone up .
...
Does it matter if there is less room for a middle class ?
...
Obviously , cities benefit economically from the presence of the rich .
Tax revenues go up when the rich pour into what some economists now call â superstar cities , â places like New York , San Francisco , San Diego , Boston and Washington that attract highly skilled people but have limits on the ability to build housing .
...
Edward L. Glaeser , a Harvard economist who studied 300 large cities with a range of levels of income inequality in the 1960 âs and 1970 âs , says he found little evidence that those levels later affected the growth of housing prices , income or population there .
Of course , cities need police officers , firefighters , teachers .
But as long as they can get the labor they need from somewhere nearby , ... middle - class shrinkage may not hurt .
In Southern California , developers import construction workers from Las Vegas and put them up in hotels ; costs go up but rich clients can pay .
...
Pay for essential workers like plumbers and cabdrivers will tend to go up ...
Professor Glaeser said : â There âs no obvious smoking gun saying cities will be substantially worse off .
There âs a whole lot of America that does a very good job of taking care of the middle class .
The great sprawling edge cities of the American hinterland provide remarkably cheap housing , fast commutes , decent public services and incredibly cheap products available in big box stores .
As a New Yorker , I understand the view that exile from New York is consignment to hell ; but that âs not accurate .
The majority of middle - class people that have moved out have presumably found themselves better lives out there . â
But sociologists and many economists believe that there can be non-economic consequences for cities that lose a lot of middle - income residents .
The disappearance of middle - income neighborhoods can limit opportunities for upward mobility ...
It becomes harder for lower - income homeowners to move up the property ladder , buy into safer neighborhoods , send their children to better schools and even make the kinds of personal contacts that can be a route to better jobs .

The government will soon be able to sue parties involved in " hoaxes " that are mistaken for terrorism if a new bill is passed by Congress .
The bill , entitled " The Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007 , " was introduced by the Senate and will amend the federal criminal code to include a number of new clauses meant to up the ante on wasting government resources .
The amendments include extensions to the prohibitions on the spread of false information and mailing threats , increases to maximum prison terms , and allowances for civil suits so that local and federal governments can attempt to recoup expenses related to an incident .
The bill 's introduction comes several months after the city of Boston made headlines over a " bomb scare " that turned out to be something not quite so serious .
The Great Mooninite Scare of 2007 was , in fact , a guerrilla marketing campaign carried out by a marketing agency employed by the Cartoon Network for its popular late - night show Aqua Teen Hunger Force .
Circuit boards with LED lights in the shape of a Mooninite were placed all over 10 cities in the US : Boston , New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , Atlanta , Seattle , Portland , Austin , San Francisco , and Philadelphia .
The signs were in place for several weeks without incident .
However , that changed one fateful day in January when a passenger on Boston 's mass transit system spotted one and alerted the authorities .
The rest , as they say , is history .
The police descended upon Boston and shut down large parts of the city over what they thought was an act of terrorism .
After realizing that the Mooninites were of no harm , the authorities were quick to call the incident a hoax and arrested two people who were employed to put the signs up .
A judge eventually said that the suspects did not appear to have intended to create panic .
However , that did not placate city officials who remained outraged at the incident , promising to push for harsher punishments in the future for incidents that waste government resources .
That brings us to where we are today , with the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007 .
Although the Mooninite scare was determined to not be a hoax ( but rather an unfortunate series of poor decisions ) , the provisions in the bill would allow the government to take civil action against parties involved in perceived hoaxes if they fail to " promptly and reasonably inform one or more parties ... of the actual nature of the activity " once they learn about investigative action taking place .
In the case of Boston , this means that everyone involved could be sued for not immediately informing the police of the campaign upon receiving news of the emergency reaction .
This sounds all well and good â who would n't want the government to be reimbursed for resources wasted during a hoax ?
However , it also assumes that the local governments themselves are n't contributing to the unnecessary waste of resources .
The government can sue individuals for contributing to the wasting of resources ( even if accidentally ) , but individuals cannot sue the city in return for the same .
Reimbursement - wise , however , things seem to have worked out in the aftermath of the Boston scare .
The companies involved in the Boston scare did in fact end up settling with the city , agreeing to pay $ 1 million to reimburse the city of Boston and another $ 1 million to fund Homeland Security .
They even issued a statement taking responsibility for the marketing campaigns that caused such disturbance , although the two suspects originally arrested in the event are still being charged for putting up the signs despite the apparent settlement between the companies and the city .
Will they get to sue in the end too ?
It seems unlikely that someone who truly wants to incite terrorist - like panic would be deterred by the possibility of a civil suit .
So what is the point of this bill , exactly ?
Friday
IN THE crisp night air , some guys are playing hockey in a rink decorated with maple leaves , watched by an appreciative crowd armed with Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts .
An ordinary scene anywhere in Canada , you might think .
Except this is Kandahar , the Taliban 's former capital .
Only here would Tim Hortons put up a sign explaining that the outlet will close if there is a warning of an attack , and reopen a quarter of an hour after the all - clear .
An extra shot with that , sir ?
The deployment in Afghanistan is a much bigger deal for Canada than it is for the Americans or the Brits .
The Canadians stormed the beaches of Normandy on D - Day , but for most of the past 50 years they turned themselves into the ultimate â soft â power , deploying their soldiers mainly for peacekeeping .
In Kandahar they have gone back to being a fighting force , and have lost more than 40 lives in the process .
If the Brits have been having a hard time in Helmand , it is the Canadians in Kandahar province who fought the decisive battle of Nato 's war so far , leading a brigade - sized assault on Taliban positions in the Panjwayi valley last autumn .
The Canadians are the first contingent to bring main battle tanks to Afghanistan .
The French - speaking men of the Vandoos regiment in Panjwayi look even bigger and meaner than the Royal Marines in Kajaki .
The operation is hugely controversial at home .
A Canadian Senate report this month said : â Anyone expecting to see the emergence in Afghanistan within the next several decades of a recognisable modern democracy capable of delivering justice and amenities to its people is dreaming in Technicolor . â
Yet among the soldiers there is a sense of relief at getting rid of the blue helmets and white paint from their armoured vehicles .
There is even some macho mocking of the Dutch in the neighbouring province of Uruzgan : â Wooden shoes , would n't shoot , â they quip .
The Canadian recreation room is filled with messages from home , whether patriotic slogans such as â Thankx for fighting for my freedom â , or apprehensive advice such as â Duck , please duck â .
Corporal Dan Haynes , of the Royal Canadian Regiment , says : â I have come into some intense situations , but I pulled through and I can say I 've had fun . â
Did it feel strange to have Canada fighting a war rather than keeping the peace ?
â It 's all part of the pre-peacekeeping part of things , " he replied .
You have to defeat the Taliban before you can do peacekeeping .
Canadian journalists are far more dedicated to reporting the actions of their soldiers than are the Brits .
A group of correspondents is permanently embedded , inhabiting a group of tents at NATO 's base in Kandahar .
They generously allow our band of visiting correspondents to pump them for information and use their internet communications .
If you go out into the countryside , they advise , it would be safer to dress up in Afghan clothes .
Fortunately there is a local carpet and souvenir seller on base who sells us a purple salwar kameez ( the traditional dress of tunic and loose trousers ) with a little embroidered cap .
I decide to forgo a turban , fearing ridicule .
Still , my colleagues are not entirely satisfied , saying the clothes are too clean to pass for local .
I use my new shirt to dust down the tent .
Thus disguised , we walk off the base half an hour later .
The Taliban may or may not be fooled , but there is now the danger of being shot by Nato soldiers , for whom one salwar kameez looks like another .
At the final checkpoint , the soldiers look bemused by the gesticulations of the tall , pale Afghan workers walking past them .
Still , our Afghan fixers waiting in cars outside seem delighted .
Being seen with foreigners can be a death sentence .
â It is good you changed clothes , â says Nour , beaming â But please take the caps off .
They are only worn by childrenâor by American special forces . â

Thursday
AFTER two days of battle rations in Helmand , the canteen at NATO headquarters in Kabul is a bountiful feast .
There are almost as many meals here as there are nationalities ( 37 ) in the international force âpasta for the Mediterraneans , curry for the Asians , smoked ham for the Germans , hamburgers for the Americans and a salad bar for the multinational veggies .
Around the tables , little ghettos of French , Italian , Turkish , American , Canadian and many other unidentifiable soldiers form spontaneously .
We have come to interview their boss , Lieutenant - General David Richards , a British commander who is finishing his tour of duty .
We journalists have an unavoidable tendency to judge the quality of people we meet by whether they a ) speak English and b ) speak to journalists .
General Richards does both willingly , and is therefore classified as a military genius .
Military types love their TLAs ( three - letter acronyms ) .
General Richards has coined a five - letter strategy : â R, D , G , P and S â , standing respectively for reconstruction , development , governance , Pakistan and security .
It 's hardly catchy , but does the job of summarising his strategy against the Taliban which , he says , depends for its success on making progress in all five dimensions â synergistically â .
Much of the interview , though , is more personal .
He defends his record in overseeing NATO 's violent deployment to southern Afghanistan last year , distances himself from tactics of static defence adopted by the British in Helmand last summer , justifies a decision to strike a deal to extricate British forces from the town of Musa Qala , warns the Americans against poppy eradication , and , in a thinly - veiled way , tries to tie the hands of his American successor , General Dan McNeill .
The new commander 's nickname , â Bomber â McNeill , inspires little confidence
Relations between the Americans and the British are poor .
Many in NATO worry privately that the new commander will be much too â kinetic â âtoo keen to use force , too reluctant to get involved in the messy , complicated , unglamorous business that the gurus of counter - insurgency call â armed social work â .
The new commander 's nickname , â Bomber â McNeill , inspires little confidence among the veterans of Kabul .
General Richards believes that an active information strategy âtalking to the mediaâis as important as killing Taliban .
But General McNeill is a different sort of leader .
He sent word to NATO staff that he would not do any interviews on arrival .
Nor would he copy General Richards 's â Prism group â , a body of exotic travellers , academics and other civilians whose job has been to offer alternative advice and facilitate access to a wider range of Afghans .
Dinner with General Richards was akin to attending the court of a philosopher king .
General McNeill , apparently , will rely on a small staff of army colonels .
They may not thank him , though .
In a country of bearded men and burqa - clad women , the Prism group has offered a rare locus for ordinary , mixed , polite and intelligent society .
In the evenings , many members of the Prism group and NATO command , with journalists and other expatriates , are to be found in a handful of meeting places in Kabul that serve alcohol .
These are hidden from sight , and protected by armed guards .
Inside , they try to recreate the ambience of a British pub or a French restaurant .
Since the arrival of foreign forces there has also been a lively trade in â Chinese restaurants â that double up as brothels .
Few people in Kabul want the return of the Taliban .
There has been progress of a kind .
Now the city can grapple with the modern ill of traffic jams .
The markets are full of goods and people to buy them .
Many seem happy for international forces to stay .
But the foreigners ' degenerate ways have not gone unnoticed .
â They are encouraging people to drink alcohol , â says one veteran Afghan journalist , â but they are stopping Afghans from growing poppies that provide livelihoods for their families . â

Wednesday
THE Royal Marines decide to take us to the sharp end of the war , in a town called Kajaki in northern Helmand .
Marines mutter cryptically about things â kicking off â in Kajaki , but offer no details .
Arrival there is by helicopter , after dark to reduce the chances of being shot down .
We land at a hilltop position overlooking the Kajaki dam , on the Helmand river .
No sooner have we exited the Chinook than things do indeed â kick off â .
The Brits are blasting away with mortars , and shout at us to get down .
A nearby position had received an incoming round shortly before we landed , probably from an old Soviet Dushka anti-aircraft gun .
The mortar line was responding .
The Athens of Afghanistan
As things quieten down , and we wait for our transport to the more sheltered base of the hill , we have tea with some of the hilltop lads .
Officially , the Royal Marines do n't do â body counts â , but up here they have a scoreboard with a stick figure for each Talib confirmed killed : ten on January 13th , four on the 16th , three on the 17th , six on the 19th , six on the 23rd and two on the 24th .
We are introduced to Royal Marine argot .
Tea is â wets â .
Accommodation is a â grot â .
Something difficult , exciting , scary or strenuous is â emotional â .
Something simple is â no dramas â .
The Brits hold a line of peaks known as Athens , Normandy and Sparrow Hawk , and they have relabelled the surrounding countryside with tags such as Nipple Hill , Balcony House , Banana Lay - by and Bandit Lane .
A big local wadi , or dry riverbed , is called the M1 , after a British motorway .
Later that evening we get a fireworks display as we are tucking into our boil - bags for supper .
A British Javelin rocket streaks through the sky , followed by tracer rounds from a machine gun on Sparrow Hawk .
A large boom denotes the detonation of a 1,000 kg bomb dropped by an RAF Harrier ( at least they arrive in time ) .
An American B - 1B bomber is on station to follow up .
The target was Balcony House , from where the Taliban had fired their anti-aircraft gun .
â Balcony House has no more balcony , â said one officer .
There were two confirmed Taliban sentries killed .
Clearly , NATO has awesome technology and firepower at its disposal , and can win any engagement .
But it does not have the forces to hold territory .
At Kajaki there is a single company of Royal Marines ( roughly 100 men ) controlling a radius of about five kilometres , with the questionable help of a small detachment of Afghan police and a private militia .
The nearest Afghan villages have been abandoned .
Beyond that , it is Taliban country .
The ultimate aim of the operation here is to promote a vital reconstruction project , the refurbishment of a hydroelectric power station at the dam to provide more power to southern Afghanistan .
To do that , about 70 kilometres of road have to be secured , with a six - kilometre corridor on either side free of Taliban , so that a new turbine can be brought up .
That job alone could occupy a battalion , even the full brigade strength of the British forces in Helmand .
The alternative is to cut deals with local tribes , persuading them to keep the road safe in return for the promise of jobs .
Something along these lines was tried in the nearby town of Musa Qala , where the British gave control to local elders and withdrew in October , after fierce battles involving paratroopers in the summer .
The Brits told us this was a â model â to be followed .
The Americans saw it as craven surrender to the Taliban , and at Kajaki both the Brits and their Afghan allies had little doubt about where the Taliban were coming from : Musa Qala .
Just before we left Afghanistan , the Musa Qala deal collapsed .
The Taliban seized full control of the town and bulldozed parts of the local police station .
Sooner or later , the Brits would have to go back in , and they would be back at square one .

Tuesday
SOME people like driving when they travel abroad , others prefer cycling or even walking .
I find there is no better way of seeing Afghanistan than from a Chinook helicopter .
The breathtaking view from the open back door is obscured only by the silhouette of the rear gunner .
On a good day the floor is also opened up so you can see the ground whizzing past the under - slung load .
It is so noisy you need not make small talk with your neighbour .
The only drawback is a draught of cold air as the chopper gains altitude
From the air , Helmand province is a small version of Egypt : an expanse of desert with river shimmering through it .
Occasionally mountains rise up from the flatness , rather as a child might draw them .
The favoured mode of transport here is helicopter or Hercules transport plane .
British and NATO forces rule the air .
On the ground , though , it is another story .
It may look featureless , uninhabited terrain , but it is for the most part Taliban country .
British helicopter pilots fly low and furiously fast , weaving like slalom skiers , rotors skimming the ground as if this were a giant grass - cutter .
The Chinooks usually fly in pairs , with an Apache helicopter gunship as escort .
All this is exhilarating , but it belies the fundamental weakness of NATO 's position in Afghanistan .
A new American manual explains that the key to success in counter - insurgency is to provide security for the local population .
Down in Helmand , the Brits worry mainly about securing themselves .
I begin to think of south Lebanon , where the Israelis were driven off the roads âand , once flying helicopters became dangerous , they were driven out of the country altogether .
If the Taliban ever find an effective way of shooting down NATO helicopters , as the mujahideen did for Soviet ones in the 1980s ( they used American Stinger missiles ) , then the mission will be doomed .
We may encounter turbulence
The main British base is at Camp Bastion , a city of tents and shipping containers in the desert , far away from any hostile population and with infinite fields of fire to intercept hostile attackers .
Once upon a time it was the Americans who were mocked for obsessive â force protection â .
But the British government knows that every British casualty in Afghanistan will erode support at home for the deployment .
After a chilly night in Kandahar ( the RAF lost our luggage and sleeping bags ) our first real stop is Lashkar Gah , Helmand 's provincial capital .
This is the geographical heart of the British strategy .
British officials describe it as an â oasis â of stability , and tell us of their plans to radiate into the countryside with reconstruction and development .
Stability is a relative term in Helmand .
British officials can move only in high - speed convoys of armoured SUVs , pushing traffic out of the way .
When we go to interview residents in the market ( where the Brits have built a new tin- roofed area ) we are surrounded by big white blokes with wrap - around glasses and guns .
The locals , though , are not shy about complaining that the fighting in the surrounding districts has made things worse ever since the Brits arrived .
We find little evidence of hearts and minds being won over .
The Brits tell us that Lashkar Gah has suffered no mortar or rocket attacks , no road - side bombs , and â only â seven suicide bombers .
The eighth blows himself up a few minutes after we pass the governor 's compound .
The armoured SUVs and the guys with guns will be busy for a while yet .

Monday
NEVER more will I associate the word â military â with â efficiency â .
We are supposed to fly to Afghanistan care of Britain 's Royal Air Force , but when we turn up at Brize Norton , west of Oxford , we are told our flight has been cancelled for lack of crew .
When we turn up the following day at 10 am we are told the flight is full because it has to take on the previous day 's stranded passengers , and journalists are â not a priority â .
A few calls to the Ministry of Defence soon set the record straight .
No doubt some poor Royal Marines are told to come back tomorrow .
Let 's hope they do n't catch up with us in Afghanistan .
Brize Norton is a throwback to a different era of air travel .
Unlike Heathrow airport , it has no swanky shopping mall , only a stationer 's shop and a little coffee - bar that has run out of hot dogs .
Goodies on sale include spare bootlaces , insect repellent , camouflage paint and other essentials for the combat soldier .
My eye is drawn to a display case of â prohibited items â for military flights ( shown below ) .
Remember the nail clippers and cigarette lighters that are imperiously confiscated from ordinary passengers in civilian airports ?
Here they worry about commando knives , machetes , pistols , ammunition and knuckle - dusters ; the kind of thing a Royal Marine might forget to leave at home .
At least bottles of water are OK .
Flak - jackets and helmets are compulsory in the cabin , to be worn on landing in the Afghan war zone .
We are soon to discover , however , that the more immediate threat to our lives is not the Taliban , but the appalling state of the RAF 's fleet of 30 - year - old Tristar transport planes .
The buses to the plane are loaded according to rank .
Colonels and lieutenant - colonels go first , followed by officers , and then other ranks .
We journalists appoint ourselves majors , in the hope of getting decent seats .
Just as we are about to reach the aircraft , though , the retreat is sounded .
The plane has developed a technical fault and we must wait some more .
We finally make it on board on hour or so later , only to face more delays .
One of the anti-missile defence turrets has broken down , and the captain must obtain permission to fly finally from the higher - ups .
It is dusk by the time we take off .
In the galley , crew members have pinned up a map showing our intended progress with hand - written crosses .
Somewhere over the Caucasus there is one marked â point of no return â .
Beyond that , explains a crew member , â if anything goes wrong we do n't have enough fuel to go back â .
The plane would have to limp on to Kandahar , or negotiate for permission to land in a possibly less - than - hospitable country along the way .
I am assured it would not be the first time this has happened .
But useful on a long flight
Everybody in the British forces , I discover , has an RAF horror story to tell .
Transport delays are commonplace , eating up valuable R&R leave .
One soldier recalls how , instead of closing the doors before take - off , the crew accidentally inflated the escape chute .
Another recounts how his plane hit the runway too hard on landing and damaged its tail .
Even the crew members are keen to retell their experiences of flying in these rust - buckets .
Not long ago Tony Blair delivered a speech explaining why Britain still had to exert hard power around the world .
If so , he 'd better order some new planes .
British cabinet ministers long ago stopped using the RAF transport fleet , preferring the Queen 's Flight , or even posh private charters .
But they still send the boys to war in clapped - out aircraft .
The captain tells us that , in the case of a loss of cabin pressure , oxygen masks will drop down .
But above my head I see only a hole .
The ceiling panel has come off , revealing the inner guts of the fuselage .
Spare parts , apparently , are hard to come by .
Still , we make it into Afghan air space without mishapâonly to hear , as we circle Kandahar , the captain announcing that we will not be landing after all .
Another turret has broken down , and we must divert to an American base at al - Udeid , in Qatar .
It proves to be an American city in the desert , complete with outlets for Pizza Hut , Baskin Robbins and Burger King .
The British reception tent has dusty camp beds and some tea on offer ; the American chow - hall offers pancakes and bacon , the air - conditioned accommodation tents have lovely bunk beds with orthopaedic mattresses .
A British NCO briefs us on our behaviour on base .
The Royal Marines must honour the British uniform , and compliment their American hosts whenever possible .
â You will be subject to American military discipline , â he bellows , â they arrest you first and ask questions later . â
Forget the special relationship .
For America , Britain is just the poor relation .
What VCS would you rather have ?
The Tortoise : Bazaar ( bzr ) A version control system , which appears to have a careful and well - planned development effort .
The latest release is numbered 0.14 .
The import from Mozilla CVS is working so far ; unfortunately , at the current import rate it will take more than a month to complete .
And we have concerns about it âs performance even after import is complete .
The Hare : Mercurial ( Hg ) A version control system , which appears to have a fast - and - loose development style .
The latest release is numbered 0.9.3 .
If it would run to completion , importing Mozilla CVS would take a couple days .
Unfortunately , every time we âve tried to do an import we âve run into bugs or undocumented features in the import tool , or odd edge - cases in the Mozilla CVS tree .
I have been helping preed bring Mozilla into the world of distributed version control systems .
It sucks .
Learning It All Over
At least for me this is a very uncomfortable experience .
I âm not going to pretend I like CVS , but at least the usage model for CVS is straightforward and fairly consistent .
For my projects I âve been using SVN without problems .
Using a distributed VCS is a mind - bending exercise in which familiar terms like â repository â , â branch â , and â merge â no longer mean what they meant .
The documentation for these tools is in general quite painful .
Partly this is because of terminology , but I have discovered that a lot of the confusion is that there is not a single usage model .
There may be an official repository which hackers â push â to ( a CVS - like model ) .
There may be a central repository maintained by the project owner who â pulls â changes from others .
There may not be an official repository at all , with a bunch of mostly - equal peers .
I think that I have a general understanding of how this is supposed to work , and I have a couple projects in Mercurial trees now .
But I have nât had to resolve merge conflicts yet , so I do nât feel that I âve done more than scratch the surface of how these tools are supposed to be used .
Importing Mozilla CVS
Importing Mozilla âs CVS repository is a large task .
The entire Mozilla CVS repository , with all its branches , has over 1 million file revisions which can be represented as about 200,000 change sets .
One of the things we decided early on is that Mozilla wanted a prepackaged solution as much as possible .
Mozilla developers â collective expertise is writing a web browser , not hacking version control .
Any time that developers have to spend patching / hacking their VCS is collective waste .
We are willing to hire outside experts to solve problems if necessary , and would very much like to do so .
Of course , before hiring somebody you have to pick a system .
Unfortunately , neither of the two candidates has reached a 1.0 release yet , and the tools which import a CVS repository into the new system are even less complete .
The two candidate VCS systems seem to have very different design philosophies , which show up quickly when performing import operations .
The Mercurial ->CVS importer is very hacky code .
The import process proceeds fairly quickly , but every time we tried it we ran into errors .
We have yet to do a complete import that contains anything but the trunk :
Random CVS commit message character sets ( patchset 565 )
The commit message in CVS are all sorts of character sets .
Initially the importer assumed that they were UTF8 and failed when it encountered invalid UTF8 .
I discovered a hidden HGENCODING environment variable which allowed the import to proceed by ignoring unknown character sets .
CVS backbranching ( patchset 5155 )
In CVS , branching is not an atomic operation , and there are several old branches that were performed at multiple times .
The importer did not know how to handle this situation .
Solution : do nât import those branches .
Commit messages containing cvsps - like output ( patchset 47070 )
Several CVS commit messages contained output that could be parsed as cvsps output .
The cvsps parser contained the hg - cvs - import tool is terrible .
Solution : I replaced the parser with the cvsps parser code contained in bzr .
AssertionError : failed to remove webshell / embed / ActiveX/tests/vbrowse/VBrowse.vbp from manifest ( patchset 61380 )
This one is still undiagnosed .
Bazaar âs CVS importer , on the other hand , feels like a carefully designed tool , with modules and unit tests .
Unlike the Hg importer , the bzr ->CVS importer has dealt with all odd input successfully .
However , importing the trunk and all branches looks like it will take more than a month on a fast machine .
I like the fact that Bazaar focuses on correctness first and then deal with performance .
Bazaar provides several desirable features , such as partial pull and a SVN frontend .
But , until we can actually complete an import from CVS we do nât know whether bzr will perform acceptably .
We have asked the bzr developers for assistance ; we âll see what happens .
To help speed the process , I created a tool to post - process cvsps output and limit it to branches which are still actively being developed .
This should help reduce import times somewhat , as well as solving the backbranching issue which broke the Hg importer .
Other Issues
In addition to the import issues , there are other unsolved problems with deploying a distributed VCS system .
We need to be able to control commit ( aka â push â ) access to the repository using our existing LDAP / ssh infrastructure .
In addition , we want to be able to log who committed which changesets to the main repository : because a user can push other people âs commits , this is not as easy as it sounds , and I have nât found a builtin log which saves this information .
Conclusion
Currently , we do nât have enough information to choose between Mercurial and Bazaar for a VCS , because we have not been able to complete a CVS import of either system .
Right now we âre leaning heavily toward Hg , because of speed issues and because we have managed to get a trunk - only import kinda working .
But the entire process is much more complicated than any of us would like , and is already turning into a major time - sucking adventure .
Hopefully we can pick a system soon , and contract out the remaining work to developers who have done this before , or at least know the tools extremely well .
Impeachment part of system of checks , balances
April 22 , 2007 â By LIZA EARLE
A call for impeachment investigations passed in 38 out of 40 Vermont town meetings because it âs common sense .
It âs not extreme .
What is extreme is the abuse of executive power , including misleading us into war , the policy of torture and disregard for citizens â rights .
Wait until Jan. 20 , 2009 ?
Nearly two more years of not questioning Bush - Cheney will cement our reputation throughout the world as a people who condone torture and lies .
Two more years of a soldier dying every seven hours and mounting hatred toward our country , all to the tune of $ 2 billion per week , is unconscionable .

If a person has his sword out all the time , he is habitually swinging a naked blade ; people will not approach him and he will have no allies .
If a sword is always sheathed , it will become rusty , the blade will dull , and people will think as much of its owner .
There are two kinds of dispositions , inward and outward , and a person who is lacking in one or the other is worthless
~ Excerpt from the Hagakure : Book of the Samurai .
Do you keep your sword hidden , afraid to show it , or do you swing it wildly ?
What does the sword refer to ?
Your personal power .
I know what you thought it referred to , but this is nât that kind of site .
From frog or barbarian
This is a post that turns you from a frog or a barbarian into a prince .
Read on !
Ladies , please read this as well ( but with a grain of salt ) .
Personal power applies to both genders , but I know next to nothing about female specific personal development , so some parts might not apply .
The relationship section at the end is particularly helpful to ladies , though .
No rites of passage
True manhood is being a perfect balance of velvet and steel .
It is the perfect balance between being hard and soft .
It is knowing when to unsheathe your sword , and when to hide it .
Are you a man ?
Most males are not .
In current culture , we grow up into adulthood without any proper training .
The education system gives us skills to earn a living , and that âs not good enough .
Being able to support yourself is just a part of manhood , yes , but only a part .
We have no rites of passage like ancient cultures do .
The result ?
Boys in men âs bodies .
What manhood Is nât
I kept my sword sheathed as a teen .
I kept my power hidden for fear of upsetting others .
I was a wimp .
I went through life governed by fear .
Read the list of what I was afraid of Do you recognize any of these in yourself ?
Fear of women ( especially beautiful ones ) , fear of the boss , fear of hard work , fear of being humiliated , of standing out , and fear of displeasing my parents .
That was not a good way to live .
I achieved nothing , I got nothing .
Other males have their swords out all the time .
These are the cool bad boys .
They use anger and intimidation to get their way .
They often show no regard for other people .
They could come across as cal9lous or rude .
I went through a phase like this ( the pendulum effect , which I shall detail in a future post ) , and it does give you slightly more power and leverage .
But I did nât like it I had simply changed I was afraid of .
I can also honestly say that people like this hide a different fear and insecurity .
Once we have developed the courage to find and draw our sword ( notice I did nât say develop personal power we are all born with power , its just buried ) , we have to learn how and when to use it .
This does nât come naturally , no matter what anyone says .
No -one is born an expert in anything .
There is always a period of learning , trial and error .
But once we pay our dues , we become a prince .
What manhood is
A prince is confident , passionate , in control , assertive , strong , brave , loyal , and has a code of honor .
He takes risks , and he does nât need the approval of others .
He has been tempered by fire .
He has faced and conquered his inner demons .
And yet he is kind , gentle , and compassionate .
He likes himself and is comfortable with who he is .
Most men do nât think it is possible to have both steel and velvet .
Others mistake strength and power for beating on their chest and roaring like a Spartan ( not that those guys are not manly , but you do nât have to roar ) .
On the other side of the fence , some guys confuse being a gentleman with being a doormat .
Think about it what is the true meaning behind the word gentleman ?
A Gentle .
Man .
Both parts are vital .
A gentleman is a man who is not afraid of life nor his desires .
He has the strength to protect his loved ones , and fight for what he believes in .
Yet one who can laugh , grieve , nurture and heal .
Who can appreciate the beauty in a child âs smile , in the sunset , and in a woman âs embrace .
How to develop it
This is an introduction to the entire masculinity section of the blog .
Well go into further detail on how to develop each trait that Ive listed above .
But I cant leave you hanging .
So here âs a basic tip : Live as if you are a prince .
Act like you âre a prince on a white horse in shining armor .
A prince , surrounded by his loving subjects , and loved by maidens and fellow warriors alike .
Not a black knight .
Not a tyrant .
( Bear with me on this one , if it sounds stupid . )
From frog to prince
How would you react in any situation , new or old , in your life ?
If you lack power , are you being too weak ?
Are you taken for granted ?
Are you being pushed around ?
Or bullied ?
Do you lack the courage to implement change , or to speak up for yourself ?
Are you too shy to ask that pretty woman out ?
Change it .
You âre not a frog any more .
Be a prince , and take matters into your own hands .
What is the right way to respond ?
That depends on your individual judgement and on the situation .
Pretend you are a prince , and handle it like one .
Take action .
Be louder at a party if you are usually shy .
Tell those people calmly and politely , but firmly that their behavior is unacceptable .
Smile and ask your crush for a dance .
Stand straight , put your arms around her waist and look deep into her eyes .
Start doing things for yourself and not other people .
Start walking in front of your group of friends .
Start taking pride in your appearance .
Ill go into more specific detail in later posts .
But do it now , without any further guidance .
Why ?
â It is the single best way to develop courage .
â It is the best way to learn ( trust me on this I worked as a tutor / lecturer in college , but the specific reasons will be too boring ) .
â It is a good way to learn how to think on your feet .
There will be situations that are unique to you alone and cant be covered on a blog or a book or anything .
You cant read up on every possible situation before trying it .
â It overcomes the common self - help mistake of reading but not doing .
Get off your arse , do it , and then read , not the other way around .
â It shows you that making mistakes is fine .
It wont be the end of the world .
Paralyzing perfectionism is often a sign of low self - esteem , and this will train you out of it .
You will make errors .
It is impossible to do something new and not slip up , and that is exactly what I want to happen .
One last note for you frogs :
Do you defend your normal , shy , wimpy actions by saying you are a gentleman ?
I did when I started .
I thought I was being a noble and gracious by being polite when walk all over me .
Wrong .
I was in a position of weakness .
Instead , be polite and soft - spoken from a position of strength , like a prince would .
Do nât hide your sword , show it .
Be prepared to use it if you have to .
A polite man with a big strong body and a big sword is far more respected than a polite man who is unarmed , frail and sickly .
Okay , go out and spend the next week as a prince .
Do it !
From barbarian to prince
Now what about the other end of the scale ?
If you are on this side , you probably have discovered the effectiveness of force .
Being loud , walking with a swagger .
Being too loud , too commanding , too arrogant .
Do you rely on your strength or size to get what you want ?
It does command a certain measure of respect from some people .
Certain things will come easier to you .
But force will always lose to power .
Those who have true power will always triumph over brute force .
What would a prince do ?
He has true power , but he does nât wield it unnecessarily .
His fire has been honed into a laser .
He speaks with measured assertion and force he does nât shout .
He controls his temper .
He expresses anger in healthy , proper ways .
He is polite and calm .
He still wont take any shit , but he wont rage against it like a child .
He takes other people into consideration when making decisions .
He learns that true power comes from compassion .
He learns to wield his power for a cause other than himself .
Go out and spend a week as a prince who uses power , not force .
( For more info on why not to use force , read David Hawkins Power vs. Force . )
Men in relationships
The benefits of being a prince are obvious .
Confidence , assertion , compassion , courage , social savvy , and so on will get you places you never dreamed possible .
You will set goals and achieve them in all areas of your life your career , studies , family relationships , social activities , and so on will all benefit .
Its slightly different when it comes to relationships , though .
Its often misunderstood that being a bad boy is the way to go when it comes to dating .
So Ill clear it up here .
Yes , the bad boys do better then the wimps and the nice guys .
But a prince would do better than the bad boys .
Its just that becoming a bad boy is fairly easy becoming a prince requires hard work .
Bad boys are attractive despite ( and sadly sometimes because of ) the danger .
They are exciting .
They are loud .
They lead the way , they dont follow .
These are often mistaken for the traits displayed by the truly confident and attractive princes .
For example , a prince speaks just loud enough for the occasion .
A bad boy speaks loudly because his ego is afraid that no - one will notice him Please tell me I exist .
A prince is exciting because hes fun .
A bad boy is exciting because hes stupid .
A prince is cool because hes confident .
If he wears a leather jacket , he makes it cool , not the other way around .
A bad boy relies on the leather jackets and slick haircuts .
A prince leads because hes a leader .
A bad boy can be mistaken for a leader because he doesnt care about his girlfriend , and he doesnt take her feelings into consideration when making decisions .
Sadly , true bad boys are self - destructive and abusive to others , including their partners , friends and family .
What is worse is that most young women canât tell the difference , especially since princes are so rare , and so fall for the bad boys anyway .
It âs a biological thing , just like when males often go for a gorgeous woman although they know she is a gold - digger or a heart breaker .
Whats next
Now that âs been cleared up , whats next ?
Have you forgotten ?
Live as a prince for a week .
Take risks .
Do things that you would nât normally do , but a prince would .
Man up to become a prince if you have too much velvet .
Temper yourself if you have too much steel .

The quote below hides the secret .

But over the years it âs stuck with me .
Can you find the secret ?
If you like this post , please support me by Stumbling it !
Roll with the punches
Non-resistance .
Earth - shattering , it might not seem , but read on .
Inner resistance disrupts peace .
Although this applies to everything that can happen in life , well use something in the quote as an example
Extreme heat is something that makes many people uncomfortable and grumpy .
Why ?
The automatic reaction is to fight the heat .
Turn the air - con on , take a shower .
Thats fine .
But what if you cant ?
What if you have to sit in a boiling room for an hour ?
Dont fight it .
Fighting it is what causes the discomfort .
Telling yourself I dont want this ; I wish I was somewhere else , I hate this feeling .
This inner resistance is not your fault ; it is simply an automatic response .
This article will help you to recognise that habit , and help you break it .
What happens when you break it ?
If , in the middle of summer , you simply let yourself be hot , without complaining mentally or vocally , and simply feel the heat , wo nât there be true peace ?
A burning hot example
To help explain , let me use myself as an example .
I was searching for peace and happiness .
It consumed me .
But I went about it the wrong way .
I tried to fix everything that made me unhappy on an individual basis .
Argument with my girlfriend ?
Hit the books and find a tactic to deal with it .
That worked until a different problem came up .
Then open the books again .
It didnt work well .
My core personality was still the same , and my peace was easily disturbed and fragile .
Then something happened that no Self - Help book can fix .
Extreme heat .
It was in the middle of a 48 degree Celsius heatwave .
I was stuck in the middle of an important evening class .
The fan was on , but with 50 people in the room we were burning .
It made me grumpy and irritated .
I couldnt concentrate .
My thoughts began drifting back to past hurts and memories , no matter what I tried to do .
As the class continued my mood got worse and worse .
The heat seemed to get more and more unbearable .
Why was this so ?
I was resisting the heat .
I wanted to finish the class so I couldnt leave .
Then I tried just letting myself be hot .
There was no resistance to it .
I turned off my mind .
I let myself stop thinking .
I simply let myself feel the heat .
What does it feel like ?
A warm sensation on my skin .
My skin was sticky .
The air seemed heavy .
These sensations in themselves were not bad .
They were only bad because I made them bad .
No sensation in itself is good or bad , it is only your mind that makes it good or bad .
Why is being sweaty irritating ?
It was just a sensation , no different to the sensation of rolling around in the softest silk sheets .
Only our mind makes the artificial distinction .
Turn the mind off .
When its off , it can no longer make a story around the heat , and then what you are feeling just becomes a sensation .
Without any resistance to it , it means nothing any more .
In my meditation class , after a while , the heat actually became quite pleasant .
More tips of switching off your mind
One way to switch your mind off is to feel everything .
This doesnt apply only to heat .
Even if you are in the midst of a bad situation â someone is shouting at you , you just found out you went bankrupt â you can simply feel .
Feel the sensation of your shirt on your skin .
Feel the wind on your skin .
Feel everything â use all your senses .
But dont attach any meaning â good or bad â to them .
That sound you are hearing isnt good or bad in itself â you make it good or bad .
That sound might be your favourite song , but it might drive someone else crazy .
Just use your senses and dont attach any meaning to anything .
Another tip is to feel your breath .
Feel the breath as it enters your nose , as it moves down your throat , into your lungs .
Feel it come out of your lungs and out of your nose again .
You dont have to purposely make your breaths deep if you do this ; it will naturally become deep .
By focusing your mind on feeling , it can no longer think .
Contrary to what we might think , the mind cannot do more than one thing at a time .
Try it if you dont believe me .
Once you turn your mind off , the emotions follow soon after .
Its like heating a soup on an oven â even if you turn the fire off , the soup remains hot for a while â it doesnt cool down straight away .
Go with the flow
Can you see how this might apply to many events that are happening in your life ?
Are you living in a house that you are unhappy with ?
Are you being stood up by your date ?
Is someone shouting at you ?
By letting go of inner resistance , you go with the flow , you roll with the punch , and you take away most of the pain .
Sleeping in a small house does nât feel that much different from sleeping in a huge mansion .
Sitting alone at a cafÃ© waiting for a date that never shows up feels no different from sitting at a cafÃ© alone because you want to be alone .
Someone shouting at you is no different from someone whispering sweet nothings in your ear .
It might hurt your ego , it might hurt your pride , but who you are , your essential core being , is unaffected .
This principle appears in major philosophies worldwide , and in the works of many great thinkers .
But most of them just dont explain it .
I dont know why , perhaps it works better if you figure it out for yourself .
The willow which bends to the tempest , often escapes better than the oak which resists it ; and so in great calamities , it sometimes happens that light and frivolous spirits recover their elasticity and presence of mind sooner than those of a loftier character .
â Albert Schweitzer
Important warning !
This philosophy is not encouraging you to let yourself be abused , or anything of the sort .
I âm talking about inner resistance , which is different from outer resistance .
For example , if someone is slapping you around , I âm not recommending you stand there and let them do it !
Do something !
Calling the police is not inner resistance , it âs not wrong .
Get out of it !
If you are freezing to death , put a jacket on !
If you are in the middle of a fire , non resistance wont magically save you from being burnt to a crisp .
Get out of it !
But once it is over , it is over .
It doesnt exist any more .
Die to the past every moment .
He or she is no longer abusing you ; learn from your mistakes and never let it happen again .
If you are in a poor financial situation and you do nât like it , I âm not saying that you just be poor forever .
If you like it , then more power to you .
But if you do nât want to be poor , work on getting out of poverty .
That is not inner resistance ; that is growing .
But what if you get angry and upset , thinking about it over and again ?
That is inner resistance , and that is the cause of unhappiness .
When hot be thoroughly hot , when cold be thoroughly cold .
DIGG THIS
Falsified Freedom
Anyone who appeals to freedom as a reason for war has to support and favor freedom .
He has to favor the exercise of freedom over one âs just property .
He has to favor the absence of unjust attacks and infringements on one âs life , liberty , and property because that is what freedom means , correct ?
Not so .
Politicians constantly make the appeal to freedom while simultaneously supporting the state âs multiple infringements upon life , liberty , and property .
What are we to think of this blatant contradiction ?
We can conclude that our rulers are hypocrites .
This is true .
They pretend to favor freedom while their every act undermines it .
Whenever they invoke freedom , watch out .
They are talking about other things , things that are not freedom , things that go against exercising one âs free will over one âs property .
Their aim is to sabotage freedom .
Our rulers are even worse than hypocrites .
They falsify the meaning of freedom in three distinct ways .
Without shame , they claim that the democratic process sanctions the laws they pass .
They claim , in other words , that since the democratic processes ( including majority rule ) are lawful , freedom is not infringed by the laws that are passed via these processes .
Then they claim that democracy guarantees freedom , meaning that democracy is what gives human beings their rights through its processes .
Finally , they claim more generally that democracy is freedom and freedom is democracy .
But all of these claims are totally false .
If majority rule or any democratic process takes one man âs just property to give to another , this destroys freedom .
Taking a man âs just property is unjust .
There is not a democracy on earth that does not destroy freedom in this way .
Nor does democracy guarantee freedoms or rights .
The rights of man are anterior to government of any kind , including democracy .
And if democratic processes violate rights and are not necessary for their existence , it is false to say that democracy is freedom and vice versa .
Rulers liberally lard their speeches with these freedom phrases .
This is by no means harmless rhetoric .
They do this to deceive their audiences .
In Orwellian fashion they are intent on persuading listeners that their ( democratic ) slavery is freedom , and conversely they wish to teach them that freedom means ( democratic ) slavery .
But since freedom means the absence of others interfering with a man âs rightful exercise of his free will , every interference by the majority upon such exercise violates and diminishes his freedom .
Since democracies routinely violate rights , they diminish freedom .
The correct slogans are slavery is democracy , and democracy is slavery .
At the risk of some confusion , we might also say that democratic freedom is slavery , that is , what passes for freedom in democracies is actually slavery .
If our rulers mislead us about something as basic as freedom , we have to be very skeptical about anything they say .
At a minimum , their other ideas are liable to be skewed and twisted too .
If some listeners suspect deceit , this is understandable .
At a maximum the more cynical will conclude that whenever politicians move their lips , it is to lie .
Fighting for freedom ?
Consider this statement made to combat veterans : " And you know the price of freedom , because you risked your lives , shed blood , and lost friends in freedom âs defense . "
Statements like these are frequently made to battle - scarred veterans .
At this point , I feel like Linda Schrock Taylor who could not tell her father , who was a veteran , what she really felt and thought : that he was used as a pawn .
It would have hurt him too much to admit that he had spent 50 years of his life celebrating the loss of his own freedom .
It is very , very hard to admit longstanding errors .
This is why Gorbachev wrote : " â¦ how can we agree that 1917 was a mistake and all the seventy years of our life , work , effort and battles were also a complete mistake , that we were going in the u2018 wrong direction â ?
No . . . it is the socialist option that has brought formerly backward Russia to the u2018 right place . â "
America is not different from Russia .
It also embraced socialism , imperialism , and empire .
It also has gone in the wrong direction for a very long time .
It also can not admit this .
It also has to hold on to the illusion that socialism has brought it to the right place , only it calls socialism by the name of democracy .
The pain of changing one âs basic view plays into the hands of rulers .
It makes it easier for them to equate slavery with freedom .
What did the veterans risk their lives for ?
They âve been bravely risking their lives for a long time , and many shed the final drops of blood that Secretary Rumsfeld referred to , for it was he who made that statement .
Suppose we choose the Spanish - American War ( 1898 ) as a convenient date .
Have the veterans defended freedom successfully ?
If that were so , we would have more freedom today than in 1898 .
This is simply not the case .
American governments today control a vastly greater fraction of every person âs life , liberty , and property than in 1898 .
Yet we are told that America won its critical wars for freedom .
The veterans defended freedom and did so successfully , we are instructed .
No , the problem here is the one analyzed above .
By freedom , Rumsfeld does not mean real freedom .
He means democratic freedom , he means democracy , he means slavery , he means socialism , he means the American system , he means the American state .
Rumsfeld spoke of the price of freedom .
Similarly , Vice - President Cheney remarked to the same audience : " Freedom is not free . "
A very high price was paid in America âs wars since 1898 , but what was it paid for ?
The question is whether all these wars were even necessary .
Many of us think they were not .
Certainly our freedom was not threatened by the Spanish , by the Central Powers in World War I , by the North Koreans , by the North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong , and by Saddam Hussein and Iraq .
And America âs dispute with Japan over Japan âs war with China led to Pearl Harbor and Germany âs entry into World War II against America .
America âs freedom was not directly at stake in Japan âs conquest of China .
But even if these wars were necessary , they brought us no closer to real freedom over property .
They did the very opposite .
" War is the health of the state , " Bourne wrote .
Every war increased the state âs control over us and our resources , as Robert Higgs has so ably shown .
Every war decreased real freedom while augmenting the state .
The veterans risked their lives for the state , state socialism , and the American empire .
And in most of the wars since 1898 , it is not clear they defended any property of the American people as a whole at all as Rumsfeld claims .
I am sure that Rumsfeld and our other rulers calculate their words and their effects .
But I do not think they construe them in terms of the kinds of arguments I am making .
They are too deep into their own unquestioned world view to be doubting their own deeply held assumptions .
Rumsfeld is not defending his ideology when he tells the veterans that they risked their lives on behalf of freedom .
He believes his own deliberate falsehoods .
He has heard and repeated them so often that he no longer thinks much about them .
And Americans have heard them so often that they no longer question them either .
Freedom indivisible
Freedom at home means ending America âs degrading democratic socialism here in America .
But freedom is indivisible ; it does not stop at the shorelines of the two great oceans .
To take wealth in order to pay for armed forces that are stationed all over the world is just as much a diminishment of domestic freedom as to take wealth in order to subsidize peanut farmers .
To funnel American resources taken from Americans to foreign countries infringes American freedom here .
For American rulers to overthrow or try to overthrow foreign regimes is just as illegitimate as trying to depose the governor of a state .
America cannot champion freedom overseas while denying it to Americans and also dominating foreign peoples through the somewhat hidden and subtle techniques of diplomacy , currency manipulations , military pressure , aid , debt , and trade pacts .
To prevent Americans from traveling or exchanging goods with foreigners is just as much an imposition on freedom as a domestic edict on the composition of gasoline .
Domestic tyranny and international tyranny go hand in hand .
The ideas that support one support the other .
They feed off of each other .
If domestic freedom is compromised , it is natural for rulers to interfere with the freedom of peoples overseas too .
Freedom at home means ending America âs international empire overseas .
Conclusion
Freedom is the basic American value , and Americans have retained this value and term throughout America âs history .
But America has changed from a relatively free country into a standard democratic socialist atrocity .
America could not have been transformed from a free country into a country tottering on the edge of abandoning its last vestiges of freedom without having transformed the meaning of the word freedom .
The concept had to change to remain consistent with the political changes .
As the country âs economic and political relationships have become debased , so has the meaning of the word freedom .
Today the word freedom as used by our rulers means something closer to slavery .
It means acceptance of the American system of government in its current form , and that means a socialism that is inimical to true freedom .
Defending freedom now means little more than defending the power of the state to do as it wishes .
Our rulers now demand that we spill our blood for them , not for the sake of our own freedom .
This is a bad bargain .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
On April 7th the peloton will be racing from Williamsburg to Richmond , VA in the inaugural U.S. Open Championships road cycling race .
This event will be the first professional cycling race to hit the streets of the Capital since the Tour de DuPont and Tour de Trump last rumbled down the cobblestones of Monument Avenue 11 years ago .
This contest will consist of both a women âs and a men âs race .
The women âs race will be a bit short and will begin in downtown Richmond , covering a total of around 27 miles .
The men âs race will start at 8:10 a.m. in Williamsburg and head west into Richmond covering 5o miles .
Once in Richmond , the racers will ride eight laps around a downtown circuit totaling seven miles .
Attending the race will be 2007 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis .
His presence at the race will help promote cycling not only here in Virginia , but throughout the country .
In addition , NBC will be televising the race by delay on April 7th at 2:30 pm .
I will be there in attendance as I was for the Tour de Trump when Greg LeMond won and the Tour de Dupont when Armstrong won .
This race will be a fantastic stage hosting the most tremendous , young cycling talent the U.S. is producing since LeMond put the U.S. on the cycling map in the 80s .
I hope to report my adventures from race in my next post .
Wikipedia has come of age .
The online user - created encyclopedia is now influential enough that the federal government feels the need to doctor it up .
In late August , someone with an IP address that originated from the National Institutes of Health drastically edited the Wikipedia entry for the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which operates within NIH .
Wikipedia determined the edit to be vandalism and automatically changed the definition back to the original .
On Sept. 18 , the NIH vandal returned , according to a history of the site 's edits posted by Wikipedia .
This time , the definition was gradually changed , presumably to avoid the vandalism detector .
Advertisement
NIDA spokeswoman Dorie Hightower confirmed that her agency was behind the editing .
She said in an e-mail that the definition was changed " to reflect the science . "
A little more than science - reflecting was done to the site .
Gone first was the " Controversial research " section that included comments critical of NIDA .
Next went the section on the NIDA - sponsored program that grows marijuana for research and medical purposes .
The next slice of the federal editor 's knife left all outside references on the cutting - room floor , replaced with links to government Web sites .
Then the battle began .
Over the next few weeks , Wikipedia users challenged the site 's neutrality and took out the more egregious propaganda .
Each time , the NIH editor would return .
The fight left the article in tatters .
Folks wondering what NIDA does now get four basic , non-controversial sentences followed by 10 links to federal Web sites .
And at the bottom of the page is a plea from Wikipedia : " This article about a medical organization or association is a stub .
You can help Wikipedia by expanding it . "
If you have nothing to lose , you can only win
When you think about it , it âs amazing how many issues around the world are caused because of people being afraid of what they have to lose , either right now or further in the future .
This is not only true on a global scale , but also on a personal level .
Many problems can be avoided if you would simply structure your life in such a way where you have nothing to lose , or in the worst case , very little .
Why would you want to do that ?
One of the important reasons is that if you have nothing to lose , the only option that remains is that anything you do , if it does not leave you in the status quo , will make you win .
Very simple reasoning , but the implications are enormous .
And when I say â have nothing to lose â it does nât literally have to mean that you have nothing to lose .
Obviously you may have things that you are capable of losing , but in that case I mean you should nât care about it if you lose those things .
One of the benefits of having nothing to lose is not having to deal with the fear of losing something .
Imagine the burden that gets taken off of your shoulders when you realize that you do nât have to worry about losing anything .
This in turn gives you more freedom to do the things that you want to do most , without having to worry about losing anything .
This is one of the most important benefits you get .
Less fear , more choices , more freedom .
Today âs world , and indeed for a very very long time now , is structured in such a way where people are directed , if not forced , to become dependent .
Dependent on the system , or dependent on others .
When you do enough research , you will find that this is all by design .
I wo nât go into details in this post , but certainly will in the future .
For now it âs enough to note that this is by design .
The reason why things are set up in this way is of course to be able to control people and limit their freedoms .
When people depend on you , you can manipulate them into behaving the way you want .
Because they depend on you , they have little choice but to go along with anything you say because they fear losing what they get from you .
By definition if someone depends on someone else , or something else , that person has something to lose .
So one of the important things in life is to be as independent as possible and rely on very few things .
After all , when it comes down to it , the only thing you can really and always depend on in life is yourself .
This does nât mean that you should nât want a lot of things in life .
Want and have as much as you like , but require as little as possible .
This is the simple rule you can use to guide you in making decisions about what you want to depend on in life .
Want as many things as you like , work hard to get them , but do nât ever be afraid of losing them .
In fact , be perfectly capable of living without them .
The moment you let yourself be controlled by the fear of losing what you have , you make yourself vulnerable and open yourself up to manipulation .
That job you always wanted ?
Work hard to get it , but do nât require it .
As soon as you require it , you depend on it , and it becomes a vulnerability .
People might use this vulnerability against you , knowingly or unknowingly .
You might get in all kinds of undesirable situations .
For example , if someone knows you desperately need that job , he / she might have you do things you would normally not choose to do .
And you would do it because of the fear of losing the chance to get that job you wanted .
Another example would be when you depended on the job you currently have .
If your employer or your boss knew about this , they could put a lot of pressure on you to get you to do whatever they wanted .
As you can imagine , people in such a position soon find themselves doing things , or agreeing with decisions , which are entirely against their principles .
If you did nât depend on that job , and had no fear of possibly losing it , you would disagree with them whenever you felt like it because you would feel absolutely free to do so .
After all , you âd have nothing to lose .
You âd be free in doing and thinking what you wanted all the time .
So when you finally get that dream job with the great salary , be careful how you handle it .
Do nât immediately go out and buy that new expensive car , that big house and take a big loan at the bank .
That only makes you depend a lot more on your job and potentially sets you up for losing a lot more if you were to lose that job .
The key thing here is to not maneuver yourself into a position where you require that job to be able to live your life .
The fact that you have it is great , and you should want even more , but never require it .
Only if you know that you will be able to handle it when you lose that job , should you do things like buying that new expensive car , that big house and take that big loan .
You should always have a plan B , and even a plan C and D , in place , just in case things do nât go as planned .
This will make that you wo nât require that job , and you wo nât be afraid of losing it as a result .
If you have to give up that new car because you lost your job and ca nât afford it , you should be perfectly OK with taking the bus again .
If you have to lose that big house , you should be perfectly OK with renting a small room somewhere and continue your life as if nothing happened .
It âs easy to do this when you require very little in life , even though you may want many things .
This is one of my basic principles in life .
There are a lot of things that I want , or already have , but I require very little of them .
I quite frankly do nât care if I have to work at some fast food restaurant or even have to become a gardener in the near future .
I do nât care if I somehow lose everything I have tomorrow .
Perhaps I âll have to go live in the bushes somewhere , but I âll try to find a way to live .
Besides , seeing how nice and peaceful Indians live here in the Amazon forest often makes me want to do the same .
I have nothing to lose .
I try to think of something I would nât be able to give up , but ca nât come up with anything .
Not even my family .
As long as I have myself I âll be just fine .
Of course I love my family and always want them around , but I do nât require it and certainly do nât depend on it .
Speaking of family , it always amazed me when watching those movies where some gangsters threaten someone with destroying their family if he / she does nât agree with something they want , and then watching that person give in to the threats .
These things also happen in reality every day .
People get threatened with their jobs and even get threatened with the jobs or businesses of other family members for example .
It can happen in many ways or forms .
Such a thing would never work on me , since I have nothing to lose .
In addition , my family are responsible for themselves .
I do nât see why gangsters would want to do something to them because they ca nât get me to agree with something .
I do nât feel responsible for them ; they âre responsible for their own lives .
Since I have nothing to lose , doing something to my family would nât change my mind .
It would be the same thing if people would kidnap my son ( which I do nât have by the way ) in order for me to agree with something they wanted .
The moment they kidnap my son , he would be their responsibility , not mine .
If he died , it would not be my fault .
And again , I have nothing to lose .
Getting me to do what they want would be the last thing they âd achieve with that .
If most people were like this , imagine how fast the manipulation around the world would cease to exist .
It would cease to exist because people would see that it would be no use to do it anymore because it would not be possible to get the results they wanted .
It âs that simple .
One of the ways people try to make others afraid of losing what they have is making sure they have little or no choice , or at the very least giving them the impression that they have no choice and that what they are getting is the best there is .
Of course , when you think about it , there âs always choice .
The problem might be that the other options available at that time may not be as nice .
But if you have nothing to lose , you wo nât mind giving up the better option and being satisfied with something less , because you did nât require the better option in the first place .
It was nice to have , but not required .
Of course you âll continue to want better and that will make that you âll work to get it again in the future .
Those who like to manipulate and control others know that having a lot of choice means having a lot of freedom and no fear of losing what you have since there âs plenty more to choose from .
So when there âs a lack of choice , create choices yourself .
You never have to put up with anything you do nât like .
Never .
And if you have nothing to lose , you âll never have to .
Is your husband abusing you everyday ?
You do nât have to put up with it .
You have choice ; you can just walk away .
Do nât depend on him to take care of you or give you whatever you may be getting from that relationship .
Become independent and have nothing to lose .
People do nât want to pay you enough for your work ?
Do nât work for them .
Go flip burgers for far less money if you have to .
Have nothing to lose .
When they can value your work well enough , they know where to find you .
And I âm sure you can think of even more examples .
The people benefitting from this system of manipulation and control of course will never like the fact that they ca nât control you .
They do nât like it when people are free to do as they please whenever they please .
They do nât like it when people can be independent and rely on themselves .
They do nât like it when people have choice , and as a result , freedom .
It becomes more difficult for them to manipulate such people .
To them , these are dangerous people .
And it âs quite easy to understand why .
I do nât think I have to explain it anymore at this point .
So have principles in life , value your integrity , make your own choices , be free and have some backbone .
Above all , make sure you have nothing to lose , because that âs the only way you âll be able to really have those things .

WHAT
provides the most complete visualization of DOM structure and hierarchy
WHY
A Picture Says A Thousand Words
is a JavaScript - based developer tool which .
It is available as a Firefox browser add - on and as a bookmarklet for use with all major browsers
Source Charts plainly express the most amount of information possible within the current viewport .
Since eyesight is the most efficient way for the human brain to process large amounts of information , visual cues which convey code structure and tag information enables the brain to take in the maximum amount of information in minimal time .
In the screenshot to the left , you can tell immediately how deeply nested the span tag is .
You can even tell the types of tags its ancestors are .
All without scrolling or reading a single tag .
" This Simple Tool can make it easier and faster for any Web developer to debug a design " - Macworld Magazine
" ... the most accessible DOM inspector available to web developers .
( This ) extension should be standard in every web developer 's toolkit . "
- John Resig , creator of jQuery , from his book , Pro JavaScript Techniques .
It 's Better Because ...
Whitespace is both an inefficient and inaccurate way to navigate the DOM .
When we have to build invisible code boundaries mentally - which always includes some devised series of manual actions ( clicking , finding , reading , etc. ) - we experience forced breaks in cognitive processing .
As the DOM becomes more complex , more productivity is lost .
It does n't take long before mentally navigating the DOM becomes impossible .
Work smart to work hard .
Whitespace Fail
One example of how whitespace fails humans is demonstrated in the Apple February 2014 SSL / TLS bug .
The extra " goto fail " line in the image ( left ) is indented , implying to a human that it is attached to the preceding if .
But in reality , it is not .
This rogue goto was the sole cause of the failure .
Would the bug have been found more quickly if the source charting interface had been applied ?
An image of the same code overlaid with a source chart ( left ) makes it obvious that the goto is outside the scope of the if .
Another article about this bug brings in to question the effectiveness of current code review tools , and is worth a read .
Typical browser " View - Source "
HOW
Theatre of the absurd , anyone ?
Using View Source Chart bookmarklet ( VSCb ) is very easy - click the bookmark to launch , and click individual containers to collapse and expand pieces of the page DOM .
Tooltip
Hovering your mouse cursor over any container , even one whose top and bottom are out of view , will display that container 's entire opening tag in a tooltip .
This allows you to easily see the opening tag of any container in the viewport .
Zoom Out
A lesser known but very useful debugging / inspecting technique is decreasing the font size ( Ctrl + -) to zoom out of the chart .
This is useful when viewing the charts of highly complex pages .
Hovering your mouse over a container will still display the container 's opening tag in a normal - sized , readable tooltip .
Bookmarklet Demo using Chrome
VSCb's Color - Coding Convention
The color convention is easy to learn and makes scanning the DOM a breeze .
You can also use it to debug a web page with a bit of acquired skill .
Customization
The bookmarklet is easy to customize if you know CSS .
Just paste into an editor and have fun !
Locating Errors
Often times , a P tag is involved in a chart anomaly , because the Firefox , Safari , and Chrome browsers do not automatically make a correction when block level elements are mistakenly placed inside a P tag .
Hence , when this type of error has occured , your charts will display container mis-matches or , as seen in the capture to the right , empty - ended containers .
Find the error using the process of elimination : begin collapsing " well " containers nested within this chart manifestation .
As you can see in the capture below , the P tag is not always the culprit .
In this screenshot , the first red flag that something is wrong is that the body tag is out of it's black - dashed - bordered container : a closing div is there instead .
Notice the iframe container : the ending iframe tag is outside its container .
In this case , the easiest way to find a mismatch is by hovering your mouse next to the end tag and comparing it to the opening tag displayed in the tooltip .
Here , the tooltip displays an opening div tag , but the container has a closing span tag .
Opera
Finally , it is of utmost importance that you know ( and take advantage of ) how Opera displays source charts .
Unlike Firefox , Safari , and Chrome who display charts based on CORRECTED and RENDERED source code , Opera displays charts based on the original source code .
This means that it will not display the result of any JavaScript - generated markup , or include corrections ( although it too makes corrections to markup ) .
Last I checked , Internet Explorer functioned in this same way .
This is a plus because you are able to see errors in full , especially helpful when pulling content together from different sources .
So why would I use other browsers who display charts based on corrected and rendered source code ? ,
You ask .
It is because of something I call " Green Code " .
What is Green Code ?
Green Coding is a method of relying on the client browser to finish building the page for you - something heavy traffic sites do to reduce file size , hence saving bandwidth .
Writing green code is very simple : omit the end tags of certain elements .
Because browsers ' HTML parsers make corrections to markup , you can omit even end tags that are n't supposed to be optional .
Viewing Source Charts in Chrome , Safari and Firefox will reveal the corrections the browsers have made to the original markup ( and the result of script - generated markup ) .
Using VSCb in these browsers is the best way to be sure your page is being parsed exactly as you want it to be .
Chrome - Safari - Firefox
This capture is from a page in which the closing span , td , and tr tags have been commented out .
The commented tags are seen , followed by the identical tags the browser replaced them with !
Even ending span tags are inserted by the browser , which are not on the end - tag - optional list .
Opera - Internet Explorer
Conversely , viewing the same Source Chart in Opera exposes the errors of the missing end tags .
The closing span , tr , and td tags are not inserted into the DOM view ( though the browser has made the corrections ) , and as a result , the subsequent tr and td tags appear inside the span tag 's container , indicating an error .
Similarly , IE returns many , but not all browser corrections .
The Moral of the Story
VSCb for Opera is a wonderful debugging tool when you want to see your original markup in charted form .
VSCb for IE is also a useful debugger .
VSCb for Chrome , Safari and Firefox is vital for Green Coding , or for simply viewing the final stage of your code after the browser gets through with it .
See this Google Webmaster article for more info on optional end tags .
Andrew Kirk , an environmental history professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , whose new book , â Counterculture Green : The Whole Earth Catalog and American Environmentalism , â will be published by University Press of Kansas in September , is reminded of environmentalism âs last big bubble , in the 1970s , long before Ronald Reagan pulled federal funding for alternative fuel technologies ( and his speechwriters made fun of the spotted owl and its liberal protectors , a deft feat of propaganda that set the movement back decades ) .
Those were the days when Stewart Brand and his Whole Earth writers , Mr. Kirk said , â focused on a brand of environmentalism that kept people in the picture . â
â That âs the thing about this current wave of environmentalism , â he continued .
â It âs not about , how do we protect some abstract pristine space ?
It âs what can real people do in their home or office or whatever .
It âs also very urban .
It âs a critical twist in the old wilderness adage : Leave only footprints , take only photographs .
But how do you translate that into Manhattan ? â
With equals parts grace and calamity , it appears .
Washed down with a big draught of engaging palaver .

Before No Impact â this is a phrase that comes up a lot â Ms. Conlin and Mr. Beavan were living a near parody of urban professional life .
Ms. Conlin , who bought this apartment in 1999 when she was still single , used the stove so infrequently ( as in , never , she said ) that Con Edison called to find out if it was broken .
( Mr. Beavan , now the family cook , questioned whether she had yet to turn it on .
Ms. Conlin ignored him . )
In this household , food was something you dialed for .
â We would wake up and call â the man , â â Ms. Conlin said , â and he would bring us two newspapers and coffee in Styrofoam cups .
Sometimes we âd call two men , and get bagels from Bagel Bobâs .
For lunch I âd find myself at Wendy âs , with a Dunkin â Donuts chaser .
Isabella would point to guys on bikes and cry : â The man !
The man ! â â
Since November , Mr. Beavan and Isabella have been hewing closely , most particularly in a dietary way , to a 19th - century life .
Mr. Beavan has a single - edge razor he has learned to use ( it was a gift from his father ) .
He has also learned to cook quite tastily from a limited regional menu â right now that means lots of apples and root vegetables , stored in the unplugged freezer â hashing out compromises .
Spices are out but salt is exempt , Mr. Beavan said , because homemade bread â is awful without salt ; salt stops the yeast action . â
Mr. Beavan is baking his own , with wheat grown locally and a sour dough â mother â fermenting stinkily in his cupboard .
He is also finding good sources at the nearby Union Square Greenmarket ( like Ronnybrook Farm Dairy , which sells milk in reusable glass bottles ) .
The 250 - mile rule , by the way , reflects the longest distance a farmer can drive in and out of the city in one day , Mr. Beavan said .
The announcement that Halliburton , the Houston , Tex. - based oil services company , was moving its headquarters to Dubai may have surprised many Americans .
But for people in Dubai , it simply ratified decades of hard work .
With scant oil reserves , Dubai âs ruling family , the Maktoums , long ago realized that their state âs future lay in serving as the commercial hub of the Arab Middle East , not pulling petroleum from the desert sands .
â They have had to live on their wits , â says Bulent Gultekin , a Wharton finance professor .
â So they âve tried to build Dubai into the business platform for the region . â
To that end , the Maktoums , led by the billionaire known today as â Dubai âs CEO , â Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , have invested heavily in the infrastructure of a modern economy .
They have built a first - class port , airport and airline ; created lightly regulated enterprise zones to foster the development of new industries and attract foreign firms ; and spent lavishly on amenities ranging from the white , sail - shaped Burj al Arab , the world âs tallest hotel , to an indoor ski slope chilled to about 30 degrees Fahrenheit .
â Sheikh Mohammed has been a real visionary , â says Todd Millay , executive director of the Wharton Global Family Alliance .
â The biggest decision he has made is to create a very free economy .
It âs true laissez faire without many of the regulations we have in the U.S. â
Indeed , in some sectors , the country might benefit from a few more rules , Millay notes .
â You see construction workers working outside in the summer when it âs 120 degrees . â
Sheikh Mohammed âs let - it - be attitude extends to the social norms that have caused so much angst in places like Saudi Arabia and Iran .
Though Dubai âs native population is overwhelmingly Muslim , expatriates and visitors can buy alcoholic beverages in restaurants and bars , and western women do nât have to wear headscarves or veils .
Sheikh Mo , as he âs known , is an avid breeder and racer of horses and knocks around in jeans and a T - shirt when he visits his thoroughbred farm in Kentucky .
The mix of infrastructure , economic freedom and tolerance is paying off as multinationals , including General Electric and AT&T , are increasingly selecting Dubai , which is about the size of Rhode Island , as their Middle Eastern base .
Others , including Microsoft and Intel , have located sizeable offices there .
The emirate also has been boosted by high oil prices , which are pumping tens of billions of dollars into the Persian Gulf area , and from political tensions and safety concerns in some nearby nations .
Long peaceful , Dubai welcomes foreigners , and expatriates comprise about 80 % of its population of 1.3 million .
â Everybody in the region has an interest in Dubai being a business hub , â says Mauro Guillen , Wharton management professor and newly appointed director of the Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies .
â You need a safe place where you can do business .
The elites in all of these countries want a haven where they can put their money and meet . â
Adds Millay : â There âs no other natural â capital â in the area like a New York , a Tokyo or a London . â
Port Controversy
Dubai , which is one of the seven United Arab Emirates , has served as a commercial crossroads in the Middle East for centuries .
Originally , local pearl divers and date farmers traded there with merchant seamen from farther east , who came bearing silk and spices .
â It âs long had commercial links with India and Iran , â says David Butter , Middle East business editor for the Economist Intelligence Unit , an affiliate of the Economist magazine .
It was a British protectorate during much of the 20th century , gaining its independence in 1971 .
In the 1970s , Sheikh Mohammed âs father realized that , to continue to play a central role in the region âs trade , his emirate needed a modern container port .
He borrowed heavily to build it , and his bet paid off .
Dubai âs port ranks as the world âs 9th busiest in container volume , and its manager , DP World , is considered a leading operator , overseeing facilities around the globe .
Last year , DP World found itself mired in controversy when it bought a British company with operations at several U.S. ports , including New York and Philadelphia .
Members of the U.S. Congress objected to Middle Eastern ownership , citing security concerns , and DP World , although it had the Bush Administration âs support , decided to sell the U.S. operations .
Oil was discovered in Dubai a few years before independence from Great Britain , and it led to a wealth surge there , as it did throughout much of the region .
But Dubai long ago weaned itself off a dependence on petroleum , Butter says .
Today , only about 5 % of the emirate âs GDP comes from oil , and the reserves are expected to disappear by 2010 .
Even so , Dubai benefits handsomely from the economic activity that the rest of the region âs oil riches generate .
Many energy company employees operate out of Dubai â often their families will remain there while they work elsewhere â and wealthy people from other Persian Gulf countries spend and invest their money there .
Those investments have fostered the real boom in today âs Dubai : real estate .
â As you come from the airport , you see hundreds of high cranes and high rises , â Gultekin says .
â It âs mind boggling .
Twenty years ago , there were three or four high rises .
Now it âs like Manhattan . â
Dubai has made the construction of superlatives a central part of its marketing strategy .
At the moment , the world âs tallest building , Burj Dubai , is rising beside the world âs biggest mall .
â They do nât want to disclose how tall it will be , â Guillen says .
â I âve heard that they have come up with a design that they can add to â if another building surpasses it .
Another hotel , even larger than the Burj al Arab , is being planned as part of a new resort complex that will encompass 31 hotels with more than 29,000 rooms .
Just off Dubai âs coast , the world âs biggest manmade islands , shaped like giant palm trees , have been dredged out of the Persian Gulf sand .
â Thousands of people are working there simultaneously to build houses , â Gultekin says .
â The entire city is like a giant construction site . â
Soon 300 more islands , shaped and arrayed like continents and islands on a map of the world , will join them .
According to the Yearbook of the United Arab Emirates , â Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of residential buildings in Dubai increased by more than 42 % , to 79,000 buildings , from 56,000 .
This compares with a modest growth in residential buildings of 6.7 % in the previous five years . â
Beware the Bubble
There is , of course , a method to the madness .
Dubai is nât a place like San Francisco , Sydney or Vancouver , with a striking natural setting .
And its beaches quickly give way to desert and the sort of climate that only camels find comfortable .
Summertime highs routinely top 100 degrees Fahrenheit .
â If the air conditioning broke down , it could quickly become an unpleasant place , â says Butter .
â But it âs been fairly well planned .
Everything is created to make life as comfortable as possible . â
Behind the opulent buildings stands the country âs equally important , if more mundane , bureaucratic infrastructure , including its ballyhooed free trade zones .
The zones try to remove the usual barriers that discourage multinationals from setting up operations in a developing country like Dubai .
Within the International Financial Centre , which includes a fledgling stock exchange , foreign firms can own 100 % of their operations â Dubai restricts ownership outside of the free zones â and pay no tax on income or profits .
Similarly relaxed rules apply in Dubai âs Internet and media zones .
A new â studio city â is targeting the film industry .
Dubai also has created a special judiciary to resolve disputes involving financial firms .
â They brought in British common law , â Gultekin says .
â They even brought in a British judge to oversee it . â
Growth on this scale brings a host of challenges and worries .
Perhaps the foremost is the real estate boom , which has the makings of a bubble â if it has nât already become one .
â There âs a huge amount of new capacity coming online , and it âs unclear what the implications of that will be , â says Millay .
â I was at a conference in Doha [ in Qatar ] , and some American real estate guys were saying , â Who âs going to live in these new buildings ? ' â
Guillen agrees : â The biggest danger is that real estate is going wild .
People are always surprised that it takes so long for a bubble to burst .
But when it does burst , the fall is really big . â
Another challenge is traffic , which like the construction , has reached Manhattan - like proportions .
â It âs totally out of control , â Guillen notes .
A big drop in oil prices also could hurt the country since it would curtail spending by citizens and companies from other Persian Gulf states as well as by western firms that do business with them .
But Butter says that Dubai has diversified its economy enough that it should continue to thrive .
â We âve had such a long period of high oil prices that the economic development throughout the region really has its own momentum , which can keep going for some time , â he notes .
â Plus , a lot of the development is related to the fact that the Persian Gulf is where much of the remaining oil and gas reserves are located .
These are the projects that are going to meet the incremental demand in the world oil market . â

The Oslo Natural History Museum opened the show last week and says it has been well attended , not least by families .
Organisers reported early criticism of the project , and being told by one opponent they would " burn in hell " .
But there has been strong interest in an aspect of animal behaviour the museum says is quite common .
It says homosexuality has been observed among 1,500 species , and that in 500 of those it is well documented .

- includes photographs of one male giraffe mounting another , of apes stimulating others of the same sex , and two aroused male right whales rubbing against each other .
We hope to reject the all too well known argument that homosexual behaviour is a crime against nature
Oslo Natural History Museum
" Homosexuality is a common and widespread phenomenon in the animal world , " says an exhibition statement .
" Not only short - lived sexual relationships , but even long - lasting partnerships ; partnerships that may last a lifetime . "
The museum says it is the first exhibition in the world to touch on a subject that has been taboo in the past .
It says sex between animals - as between humans - is often a matter of enjoyment , rather than procreation , and that this applies to animals of the same sex as well as opposite sexes .
' Bisexual species '
While homosexuality would appear to contradict evolutionary imperatives , scientists involved in the exhibition say it appears to do no harm and may actually help in some circumstances .
Sometimes a pair of male birds may rear eggs " donated " by a female .
In the case of flamingos , for instance , " two males can hold a much larger territory than a regular flamingo pair , thus more chicks can grow up " , the exhibition states .
Pairs of male flamingos have been known to raise young
In some colonies , as many as one in 10 pairs of penguins may be same - sex , while " in some animals the whole species is bisexual " , the exhibition says , giving bonobo chimpanzees as an example .
There has been some hostility to the exhibition .
An American commentator said it was an example of " propaganda invading the scientific world " .
Petter Bockman , a zoologist who helped put the show together , admitted that " there is a political motive " .
In Norway there was a desire among publicly funded museums to be " deliverers of truth " and to " put on display controversial subjects , things that are not said and are swept under the carpet " .
The museum says one of its aims is to " help to de-mystify homosexuality among people ... we hope to reject the all too well known argument that homosexual behaviour is a crime against nature " .
BYTE Interview with Richard Stallman
Conducted by David Betz and Jon Edwards
Richard Stallman discusses his public - domain Unix - compatible software system with BYTE editors ( July 1986 )
Richard Stallman has undertaken probably the most ambitious free software development project to date , the GNU system .
In his GNU Manifesto , published in the March 1985 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal , Stallman described GNU as a â complete Unix - compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it â¦
Once GNU is written , everyone will be able to obtain good system software free , just like air . â ( GNU is an acronym for GNU 's Not Unix ; the â G â is pronounced . )
Stallman is widely known as the author of EMACS , a powerful text editor that he developed at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .
It is no coincidence that the first piece of software produced as part of the GNU project was a new implementation of EMACS .
GNU EMACS has already achieved a reputation as one of the best implementations of EMACS currently available at any price .
BYTE : We read your GNU Manifesto in the March 1985 issue of Dr. Dobb's .
What has happened since ?
Was that really the beginning , and how have you progressed since then ?
Stallman :
The publication in Dr. Dobb 's was n't the beginning of the project .
I wrote the GNU Manifesto when I was getting ready to start the project , as a proposal to ask computer manufacturers for funding .
They did n't want to get involved , and I decided that rather than spend my time trying to pursue funds , I ought to spend it writing code .
The manifesto was published about a year and a half after I had written it , when I had barely begun distributing the GNU EMACS .
Since that time , in addition to making GNU EMACS more complete and making it run on many more computers , I have nearly finished the optimizing C compiler and all the other software that is needed for running C programs .
This includes a source - level debugger that has many features that the other source - level debuggers on Unix do n't have .
For example , it has convenience variables within the debugger so you can save values , and it also has a history of all the values that you have printed out , making it tremendously easier to chase around list structures .
BYTE : You have finished an editor that is now widely distributed and you are about to finish the compiler .
Stallman : I expect that it will be finished this October .
BYTE : What about the kernel ?
Stallman : I 'm currently planning to start with the kernel that was written at MIT and was released to the public recently with the idea that I would use it .
This kernel is called TRIX ; it 's based on remote procedure call .
I still need to add compatibility for a lot of the features of Unix which it does n't have currently .
I have n't started to work on that yet .
I 'm finishing the compiler before I go to work on the kernel .
I am also going to have to rewrite the file system .
I intend to make it failsafe just by having it write blocks in the proper order so that the disk structure is always consistent .
Then I want to add version numbers .
I have a complicated scheme to reconcile version numbers with the way people usually use Unix .
You have to be able to specify filenames without version numbers , but you also have to be able to specify them with explicit version numbers , and these both need to work with ordinary Unix programs that have not been modified in any way to deal with the existence of this feature .
I think I have a scheme for doing this , and only trying it will show me whether it really does the job .
BYTE : Do you have a brief description you can give us as to how GNU as a system will be superior to other systems ?
We know that one of your goals is to produce something that is compatible with Unix .
But at least in the area of file systems you have already said that you are going to go beyond Unix and produce something that is better .
Stallman :
The C compiler will produce better code and run faster .
The debugger is better .
With each piece I may or may not find a way to improve it .
But there is no one answer to this question .
To some extent I am getting the benefit of reimplementation , which makes many systems much better .
To some extent it 's because I have been in the field a long time and worked on many other systems .
I therefore have many ideas to bring to bear .
One way in which it will be better is that practically everything in the system will work on files of any size , on lines of any size , with any characters appearing in them .
The Unix system is very bad in that regard .
It 's not anything new as a principle of software engineering that you should n't have arbitrary limits .
But it just was the standard practice in writing Unix to put those in all the time , possibly just because they were writing it for a very small computer .
The only limit in the GNU system is when your program runs out of memory because it tried to work on too much data and there is no place to keep it all .
BYTE : And that is n't likely to be hit if you 've got virtual memory .
You may just take forever to come up with the solution .
Stallman : Actually these limits tend to hit in a time long before you take forever to come up with the solution .
BYTE : Can you say something about what types of machines and environments GNU EMACS in particular has been made to run under ?
It 's now running on VAXes ; has it migrated in any form to personal computers ?
Stallman : I 'm not sure what you mean by personal computers .
For example , is a Sun a personal computer ?
GNU EMACS requires at least a megabyte of available memory and preferably more .
It is normally used on machines that have virtual memory .
Except for various technical problems in a few C compilers , almost any machine with virtual memory and running a fairly recent version of Unix will run GNU EMACS , and most of them currently do .
BYTE : Has anyone tried to port it to Ataris or Macintoshes ?
Stallman : The Atari 1040ST still does n't have quite enough memory .
The next Atari machine , I expect , will run it .
I also think that future Ataris will have some forms of memory mapping .
Of course , I am not designing the software to run on the kinds of computers that are prevalent today .
I knew when I started this project it was going to take a few years .
I therefore decided that I did n't want to make a worse system by taking on the additional challenge of making it run in the currently constrained environment .
So instead I decided I 'm going to write it in the way that seems the most natural and best .
I am confident that in a couple of years machines of sufficient size will be prevalent .
In fact , increases in memory size are happening so fast it surprises me how slow most of the people are to put in virtual memory ; I think it is totally essential .
BYTE : I think people do n't really view it as being necessary for single - user machines .
Stallman :
They do n't understand that single user does n't mean single program .
Certainly for any Unix - like system it 's important to be able to run lots of different processes at the same time even if there is only one of you .
You could run GNU EMACS on a nonvirtual - memory machine with enough memory , but you could n't run the rest of the GNU system very well or a Unix system very well .
BYTE : How much of LISP is present in GNU EMACS ?
It occurred to me that it may be useful to use that as a tool for learning LISP .
Stallman :
You can certainly do that .
GNU EMACS contains a complete , although not very powerful , LISP system .
It 's powerful enough for writing editor commands .
It 's not comparable with , say , a Common LISP System , something you could really use for system programming , but it has all the things that LISP needs to have .
BYTE : Do you have any predictions about when you would be likely to distribute a workable environment in which , if we put it on our machines or workstations , we could actually get reasonable work done without using anything other than code that you distribute ?
Stallman :
It 's really hard to say .
That could happen in a year , but of course it could take longer .
It could also conceivably take less , but that 's not too likely anymore .
I think I 'll have the compiler finished in a month or two .
The only other large piece of work I really have to do is in the kernel .
I first predicted GNU would take something like two years , but it has now been two and a half years and I 'm still not finished .
Part of the reason for the delay is that I spent a lot of time working on one compiler that turned out to be a dead end .
I had to rewrite it completely .
Another reason is that I spent so much time on GNU EMACS .
I originally thought I would n't have to do that at all .
BYTE : Tell us about your distribution scheme .
Stallman : I do n't put software or manuals in the public domain , and the reason is that I want to make sure that all the users get the freedom to share .
I do n't want anyone making an improved version of a program I wrote and distributing it as proprietary .
I do n't want that to ever be able to happen .
I want to encourage the free improvements to these programs , and the best way to do that is to take away any temptation for a person to make improvements nonfree .
Yes , a few of them will refrain from making improvements , but a lot of others will make the same improvements and they 'll make them free .
BYTE : And how do you go about guaranteeing that ?
Stallman : I do this by copyrighting the programs and putting on a notice giving people explicit permission to copy the programs and change them but only on the condition that they distribute under the same terms that I used , if at all .
You do n't have to distribute the changes you make to any of my programs â you can just do it for yourself , and you do n't have to give it to anyone or tell anyone .
But if you do give it to someone else , you have to do it under the same terms that I use .
BYTE : Do you obtain any rights over the executable code derived from the C compiler ?
Stallman :
The copyright law does n't give me copyright on output from the compiler , so it does n't give me a way to say anything about that , and in fact I do n't try to .
I do n't sympathize with people developing proprietary products with any compiler , but it does n't seem especially useful to try to stop them from developing them with this compiler , so I am not going to .
BYTE : Do your restrictions apply if people take pieces of your code to produce other things as well ?
Stallman : Yes , if they incorporate with changes any sizable piece .
If it were two lines of code , that 's nothing ; copyright does n't apply to that .
Essentially , I have chosen these conditions so that first there is a copyright , which is what all the software hoarders use to stop everybody from doing anything , and then I add a notice giving up part of those rights .
So the conditions talk only about the things that copyright applies to .
I do n't believe that the reason you should obey these conditions is because of the law .
The reason you should obey is because an upright person when he distributes software encourages other people to share it further .
BYTE : In a sense you are enticing people into this mode of thinking by providing all of these interesting tools that they can use but only if they buy into your philosophy .
Stallman : Yes .
You could also see it as using the legal system that software hoarders have set up against them .
I 'm using it to protect the public from them .
BYTE : Given that manufacturers have n't wanted to fund the project , who do you think will use the GNU system when it is done ?
Stallman : I have no idea , but it is not an important question .
My purpose is to make it possible for people to reject the chains that come with proprietary software .
I know that there are people who want to do that .
Now , there may be others who do n't care , but they are not my concern .
I feel a bit sad for them and for the people that they influence .
Right now a person who perceives the unpleasantness of the terms of proprietary software feels that he is stuck and has no alternative except not to use a computer .
Well , I am going to give him a comfortable alternative .
Other people may use the GNU system simply because it is technically superior .
For example , my C compiler is producing about as good a code as I have seen from any C compiler .
And GNU EMACS is generally regarded as being far superior to the commercial competition .
And GNU EMACS was not funded by anyone either , but everyone is using it .
I therefore think that many people will use the rest of the GNU system because of its technical advantages .
But I would be doing a GNU system even if I did n't know how to make it technically better because I want it to be socially better .
The GNU project is really a social project .
It uses technical means to make a change in society .
BYTE : Then it is fairly important to you that people adopt GNU .
It is not just an academic exercise to produce this software to give it away to people .
You hope it will change the way the software industry operates .
Stallman : Yes .
Some people say no one will ever use it because it does n't have some attractive corporate logo on it , and other people say that they think it is tremendously important and everyone 's going to want to use it .
I have no way of knowing what is really going to happen .
I do n't know any other way to try to change the ugliness of the field that I find myself in , so this is what I have to do .
BYTE : Can you address the implications ?
You obviously feel that this is an important political and social statement .
Stallman :
It is a change .
I 'm trying to change the way people approach knowledge and information in general .
I think that to try to own knowledge , to try to control whether people are allowed to use it , or to try to stop other people from sharing it , is sabotage .
It is an activity that benefits the person that does it at the cost of impoverishing all of society .
One person gains one dollar by destroying two dollars ' worth of wealth .
I think a person with a conscience would n't do that sort of thing except perhaps if he would otherwise die .
And of course the people who do this are fairly rich ; I can only conclude that they are unscrupulous .
I would like to see people get rewards for writing free software and for encouraging other people to use it .
I do n't want to see people get rewards for writing proprietary software because that is not really a contribution to society .
The principle of capitalism is the idea that people manage to make money by producing things and thereby are encouraged to do what is useful , automatically , so to speak .
But that does n't work when it comes to owning knowledge .
They are encouraged to do not really what 's useful , and what really is useful is not encouraged .
I think it is important to say that information is different from material objects like cars and loaves of bread because people can copy it and share it on their own and , if nobody attempts to stop them , they can change it and make it better for themselves .
That is a useful thing for people to do .
This is n't true of loaves of bread .
If you have one loaf of bread and you want another , you can't just put your loaf of bread into a bread copier .
You can't make another one except by going through all the steps that were used to make the first one .
It therefore is irrelevant whether people are permitted to copy it â it 's impossible .
Books were printed only on printing presses until recently .
It was possible to make a copy yourself by hand , but it was n't practical because it took so much more work than using a printing press .
And it produced something so much less attractive that , for all intents and purposes , you could act as if it were impossible to make books except by mass producing them .
And therefore copyright did n't really take any freedom away from the reading public .
There was n't anything that a book purchaser could do that was forbidden by copyright .
But this is n't true for computer programs .
It 's also not true for tape cassettes .
It 's partly false now for books , but it is still true that for most books it is more expensive and certainly a lot more work to Xerox them than to buy a copy , and the result is still less attractive .
Right now we are in a period where the situation that made copyright harmless and acceptable is changing to a situation where copyright will become destructive and intolerable .
So the people who are slandered as â pirates â are in fact the people who are trying to do something useful that they have been forbidden to do .
The copyright laws are entirely designed to help people take complete control over the use of some information for their own good .
But they are n't designed to help people who want to make sure that the information is accessible to the public and stop others from depriving the public .
I think that the law should recognize a class of works that are owned by the public , which is different from public domain in the same sense that a public park is different from something found in a garbage can .
It 's not there for anybody to take away , it 's there for everyone to use but for no one to impede .
Anybody in the public who finds himself being deprived of the derivative work of something owned by the public should be able to sue about it .
BYTE : But are n't pirates interested in getting copies of programs because they want to use those programs , not because they want to use that knowledge to produce something better ?
Stallman : I do n't see that that 's the important distinction .
More people using a program means that the program contributes more to society .
You have a loaf of bread that could be eaten either once or a million times .
BYTE : Some users buy commercial software to obtain support .
How does your distribution scheme provide support ?
Stallman : I suspect that those users are misled and are not thinking clearly .
It is certainly useful to have support , but when they start thinking about how that has something to do with selling software or with the software being proprietary , at that point they are confusing themselves .
There is no guarantee that proprietary software will receive good support .
Simply because sellers say that they provide support , that does n't mean it will be any good .
And they may go out of business .
In fact , people think that GNU EMACS has better support than commercial EMACSes .
One of the reasons is that I 'm probably a better hacker than the people who wrote the other EMACSes , but the other reason is that everyone has sources and there are so many people interested in figuring out how to do things with it that you do n't have to get your support from me .
Even just the free support that consists of my fixing bugs people report to me and incorporating that in the next release has given people a good level of support .
You can always hire somebody to solve a problem for you , and when the software is free you have a competitive market for the support .
You can hire anybody .
I distribute a service list with EMACS , a list of people 's names and phone numbers and what they charge to provide support .
BYTE : Do you collect their bug fixes ?
Stallman :
Well , they send them to me .
I asked all the people who wanted to be listed to promise that they would never ask any of their customers to keep secret whatever they were told or any changes they were given to the GNU software as part of that support .
BYTE : So you can't have people competing to provide support based on their knowing the solution to some problem that somebody else does n't know .
Stallman : No .
They can compete based on their being clever and more likely to find the solution to your problem , or their already understanding more of the common problems , or knowing better how to explain to you what you should do .
These are all ways they can compete .
They can try to do better , but they cannot actively impede their competitors .
BYTE : I suppose it 's like buying a car .
You 're not forced to go back to the original manufacturer for support or continued maintenance .
Stallman :
Or buying a house â what would it be like if the only person who could ever fix problems with your house was the contractor who built it originally ?
That is the kind of imposition that 's involved in proprietary software .
People tell me about a problem that happens in Unix .
Because manufacturers sell improved versions of Unix , they tend to collect fixes and not give them out except in binaries .
The result is that the bugs do n't really get fixed .
BYTE : They 're all duplicating effort trying to solve bugs independently .
Stallman : Yes .
Here is another point that helps put the problem of proprietary information in a social perspective .
Think about the liability insurance crisis .
In order to get any compensation from society , an injured person has to hire a lawyer and split the money with that lawyer .
This is a stupid and inefficient way of helping out people who are victims of accidents .
And consider all the time that people put into hustling to take business away from their competition .
Think of the pens that are packaged in large cardboard packages that cost more than the penâ just to make sure that the pen is n't stolen .
Would n't it be better if we just put free pens on every street corner ?
And think of all the toll booths that impede the flow of traffic .
It 's a gigantic social phenomenon .
People find ways of getting money by impeding society .
Once they can impede society , they can be paid to leave people alone .
The waste inherent in owning information will become more and more important and will ultimately make the difference between the utopia in which nobody really has to work for a living because it's all done by robots and a world just like ours where everyone spends much time replicating what the next fellow is doing .
BYTE : Like typing in copyright notices on the software .
Stallman :
More like policing everyone to make sure that they do n't have forbidden copies of anything and duplicating all the work people have already done because it is proprietary .
BYTE : A cynic might wonder how you earn your living .
Stallman : From consulting .
When I do consulting , I always reserve the right to give away what I wrote for the consulting job .
Also , I could be making my living by mailing copies of the free software that I wrote and some that other people wrote .
Lots of people send in $ 150 for GNU EMACS , but now this money goes to the Free Software Foundation that I started .
The foundation does n't pay me a salary because it would be a conflict of interest .
Instead , it hires other people to work on GNU .
As long as I can go on making a living by consulting I think that 's the best way .
BYTE : What is currently included in the official GNU distribution tape ?
Stallman : Right now the tape contains GNU EMACS ( one version fits all computers ) ; Bison , a program that replaces YACC ; MIT Scheme , which is Professor Sussman 's super - simplified dialect of LISP ; and Hack , a dungeon - exploring game similar to Rogue .
BYTE : Does the printed manual come with the tape as well ?
Stallman : No. Printed manuals cost $ 15 each or copy them yourself .
Copy this interview and share it , too .
BYTE : How can you get a copy of that ?
Stallman : Write to the Free Software Foundation , 675 Massachusetts Ave. , Cambridge , MA 02139 .
[ The current address ( since 2005 ) is : Free Software Foundation 51 Franklin St , Fifth Floor Boston , MA 02110- 1301 , USA Voice : +1-617-542-5942 Fax : +1-617-542-2652 ]
BYTE : What are you going to do when you are done with the GNU system ?
Stallman : I 'm not sure .
Sometimes I think that what I 'll go on to do is the same thing in other areas of software .
BYTE : So this is just the first of a whole series of assaults on the software industry ?
Stallman : I hope so .
But perhaps what I 'll do is just live a life of ease working a little bit of the time just to live .
I do n't have to live expensively .
The rest of the time I can find interesting people to hang around with or learn to do things that I do n't know how to do .
Levitown is a bus ride beyond the aptly named Hicksville in the outer suburbs of New York .
Its lawns are neat and its houses boxy .
From many gardens fly American flags and yellow ribbons : typical displays of suburban patriotism .
It was here , almost 60 years ago , that modern American suburbia was born .
Work began on the town in 1947 and Long Island potato fields were soon covered with a radical new form of housing : single , similar , purpose - built houses designed for car - owners and aimed at families .
At the time it was a shock .
Social scientists scoffed at Levittown .
But within decades the suburban experiment had come to define US life and what began in Levittown now covers the country in urban sprawl , strip malls and a way of life revolving around the car .
Now there are fears it is coming to an end .
For the past five years America has been gripped by a housing price bubble .
It has funded a huge expansion of suburbia as Americans poured their wealth into their homes .
Yet many think that bubble may be about to burst .
That would send shock waves through the US economy and into the rest of the world .
Nor is that the only threat .
The rising price of oil is squeezing suburbanites .
It threatens a way of life where pavements are rare and everyone moves by car .
' We have invested all our wealth in a living arrangement with no future , ' said James Howard Kunstler , author of the Long Emergency which postulates the end of suburbia .
' In building suburbia we embarked on the greatest misallocation of wealth in the history of the world . '
Not that it looked that way in Levittown last week .
Kids were driven to school , fathers and mothers drove off to work , the retired sheltered indoors from the heat .
Most had an obvious pride in where they lived .
' It 's quiet and its peaceful .
It 's great here .
I know it 's the suburbs but it is where you want to live to raise a family , ' said resident Sherri Smith .
Yet there are real signs America 's long and profitable love affair with the suburbs may be over .
The past five years have seen an unprecedented rise in house prices , which in turn has triggered a massive building boom .
But the pace of house sales in America has now declined nine months in a row after setting a record last summer .
Across the US once booming markets are stagnant or prices slipping .
One recent survey showed home builders have started offering free add - ons , like pools or garages , in order to sell their houses .
Home builder confidence is at its lowest level in 14 years .
Fortune magazine recently headlined a piece on the housing bubble with the words : ' Welcome to the Dead Zone ' .
It is a far cry from the mania of the past five years when Americans queued up - sometimes literally - to buy homes in new developments , often doubling their investment in 12 months .
Not surprisingly the construction industry responded by a binge of development that saw 75 per cent of new building taking place in the suburbs .
That has left the economy deeply reliant on housing .
Between 2001 and 2005 housing created 43 per cent of all new jobs in America .
If the bubble bursts , the economy could plunge into recession .
So tied up is the average American that a 20 per cent drop in prices is seen as equivalent in effect to a 40 per cent drop in the stock market .
Though a price collapse would be devastating , trapping homeowners in negative equity and wiping out savings , the fallout cannot be underestimated .
Soaring oil prices have threatened suburbia as petrol has risen above $ 3 a gallon .
At the same time heating costs have risen and the so - called McMansions of the 1990s are expensive to keep warm .
' We have these terrible perfect storm conditions .
The real estate market in America has gone south .
We will get a death spiral , ' said Kunstler .
Those warning of a coming crisis believe suburbia 's economic collapse would force a rethink of the fundamentals of the American way of life .
The cultural and political force of suburbia is vast .
It is where most Americans live .
From The Graduate to American Beauty to Desperate Housewives , the suburbs pervade culture .
Their bonhomie and good living have been celebrated in iconic TV shows such as Father Knows Best .
Their dark side has also been explored in everything from David Lynch 's surreal films to The Simpsons .
' The great American story has ultimately been told in the suburbs , ' said Professor Robert Thompson of Syracuse University .
Thompson has charted how popular portrayals of the suburbs have changed .
In the 1950s it was a celebration of their Edenic qualities as a place to raise a family .
By the 1980s cynicism had set in .
But most Americans have still chosen to live there , which leads some to believe predictions of a crisis are overblown .
Professor Robert Bruegmann of the University of Illinois in Chicago sees the suburban model as the future .
In his book , Sprawl , Bruegmann launched a passionate defence of modern urban development that , he argues , has been a great democratic leveller : allowing ordinary working families access to a standard of living previously only available to the wealthy .
And the idea of suburbia as a homogeneous , mainly white , cultural desert is a myth .
' They have always been more diverse and interesting than people ever thought , ' he said .
Suburbia is home to 38 per cent of black Americans , 58 per cent of Asian Americans and more than half of Hispanics .
It is also where most new immigrants choose to live .
Bruegmann says the model has been closely copied in Europe and thus : ' High oil prices have no impact on suburbs .
We have already had that experiment .
It is called Europe . '
He believes antipathy towards the suburbs lies in the snobbishness of elite culture - Victorian styles were ridiculed right up until the 1950s .
Now the first suburban houses in Levittown are sought after as historical monuments .
Bruegmann thinks tastes will change as suburban living becomes ingrained in the American psyche .
' That Wal - Mart store that everyone now reviles will be seen as quaint .
People will say what wonderful construction methods we had back then , ' he said .
There may be some truth in that .
When Levittown was first built , the houses were derided by architectural critics .
Now the Smithsonian Institution in Washington wants to buy one .
But federal officials said that the fastest - growing type of Medicare Advantage plan generally does not coordinate care , does not save money for Medicare and has been at the center of marketing abuses .
These â private fee - for - service plans â allow patients to go to any doctor or hospital that will provide care on terms set by the insurer .
In most cases , no one manages the care .
And some patients have found that they have less access to care , because their doctors refuse to take patients in private fee - for - service plans .
Moreover , those plans may be more expensive than traditional Medicare for some patients , because the co-payments for some services may be higher .
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission says that the cost to the government is also higher because it pays the private fee - for - service plans , on average , 19 percent more than the cost of traditional Medicare .
Richard S. Foster , chief actuary for the Medicare program , said â the additional payments to Medicare Advantage plans , above and beyond the costs â of traditional Medicare , were causing higher premiums for all beneficiaries and speeding the depletion of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for Medicare .
Almost one - fifth of the 43 million Medicare beneficiaries are now in some type of private plan .
Much of the growth in private fee - for - service plans has come in rural areas , where doctors and hospitals are often in short supply .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI is guilty of " serious misuse " of the power to secretly obtain private information under the Patriot Act , a government audit said Friday .
The Justice Department 's inspector general looked at the FBI 's use of national security letters , in which agents demand personal and business information about individuals -- such as financial , phone , and Internet records -- without court orders .
The audit found the letters were issued without proper authority , cited incorrect statutes or obtained information they were n't supposed to .
As many as 22 percent of national security letters were not recorded , the audit said .
" We concluded that many of the problems we identified constituted serious misuse of the FBI 's national security letter authorities , " Inspector General Glenn A . Fine said in the report .
The audit said there were no indications that the FBI 's use of the letters " constituted criminal misconduct . "
The audit sparked a new stage in the ongoing battle over the Patriot Act , which was put into place after the September 11 attacks .
Critics have slammed some of its provisions for intruding on civil liberties .
The American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress to " act immediately to repeal these dangerous Patriot Act provisions . "
The FBI has made as many as 56,000 requests a year for information using the letters since the Patriot Act was passed in October 2001 , the audit found .
A single letter can contain multiple information requests , and multiple letters may target one individual .
The audit found that in 2004 and 2005 , more than half of the targets of the national security letters were U.S. citizens .
Letter used to track phone calls , FBI says
FBI Director Robert Mueller said Friday that 90 percent of the letters are used to access phone records in helping to track U.S. contacts with suspected terrorists overseas .
Mueller took responsibility for the FBI 's problems and said steps had been taken to eliminate them .
" I am the person responsible , I am the person accountable , and I am committed to ensuring that we correct these deficiencies and live up to these responsibilities , " he said .
President Bush learned of the report about a week ago , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
Earlier this week , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Mueller briefed Bush on its key findings , as well as measures the Justice Department and the FBI were proposing in response , she said .
Bush was " relieved to learn the inspector general found no instances of intentional misconduct , " Perino said , but expressed " significant concern over the seriousness of the issues . "
The inspector general 's review identified " 26 possible intelligence violations " between 2003 and 2005 , 19 of which the FBI reported to the president 's Intelligence Oversight Board , the audit said .
Of the 26 , " 22 were the result of FBI errors , while four were caused by mistakes made by recipients '' of the letters , it said .
The audit also found problems with " exigent letters , " which are supposed to be used only in emergencies when time may not permit the national security letter procedure to be followed .
The audit found exigent letters were not used in emergencies and gave the agency access to telephone records it should not have had .
Mueller said Friday the FBI stopped using exigent letters in May 2006 after the practice was revealed .
He said they were used to obtain information the FBI was entitled to but should have gained in other ways .
Use of letters grew after 9/11 attacks
Most of the 200 - page report focuses on the national security letters , the use of which it says has undergone a " dramatic increase " since the Patriot Act was put into law after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The letters existed before the attacks , but the Patriot Act allowed them to be used on a broader scale to seek more information .
The American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress to " act immediately to repeal these dangerous Patriot Act provisions . "
Gonzales wrote
Fine praising the report and saying he has asked the Justice Department 's National Security Division and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Office to work with the FBI in making changes .
" They will report to me regularly on their progress , " Gonzales said .
" In addition , I ask that you report to me in four months on the implementation of your recommendations . "
Mueller said the national security letters are indispensable in the the war on terror , citing the recent arrest on espionage charges of a former U.S. Navy sailor in Arizona as one instance where the letters were needed .
The FBI director said no one has suffered harm from the errors made in use of the letters .
On Capitol Hill , the audit brought calls for better oversight and possibly changes in the law .
Rep. Silvestre Reyes , D - Texas , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , announced he will hold " briefings and hearings to understand the scope of these problems and to ensure corrective action has been taken . "
Sen . Arlen Specter , R - Pennsylvania , said the Patriot Act may have to be changed and the FBI 's power curtailed because " they appear not to be able to know how to use it . "
" You cannot have people act as free agents on something where they are going to be delving into your privacy , " Sen .
Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , said .
" We all want to stop terrorists .
We all want to stop criminals .
But the FBI work for us , the American people , not the other way around . "

CSS Styling for Print and Other Media
In : Articles
By Ian Lloyd
Note :
This excerpt from the upcoming book â Pro CSS Techniques â by Jeff Croft , Ian Lloyd , and Dan Rubin , has been edited for this publication with permission of the chapter âs author , Ian Lloyd .
The excerpt is approximately two - thirds of the length of the original chapter .
There are many different media types that you can apply to CSS , some of which are more useful than others , and they let you specify the look , feel , or sound of the web page that is linked to the CSS files .
In this section , we âll look at the various media types that are available ( as gleaned from the official source , namely the W3C : www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html#q1).
However , rather than list them all and suggest wonderfully practical ways to use them , we âll break the list down into two categories : useful and not - so - useful ( read : which ones you âre likely to use on a day - to - day basis in the foreseeable future , and those that you wo nât touch in a month of Sundays ) .
The Useful Media Types
This list includes the media types that you will truly find a use for on regular occasions :
screen â For color computer screens
/files/includes/print.css âFor / files / includes / print.cssed versions of the document
projection â For presentation or kiosk versions of the document ( where toolbars are removed , and the display renders completely full screen )
all â For styles that are suitable for all devices
We âll be using ( or covering briefly ) these media types in this chapter âs examples .
The Not -So - Useful Media Types
Remember what I was saying about those media types that you âd never use in a month of Sundays ?
Well , here they are , listed for your soon - to - be - ignored pleasure :
aural â For use with speech synthesizers or talking browsers
braille â For Braille - tactile feedback devices
embossed â For paged Braille / files / includes / print.cssers
handheld â For handheld devices ( for example , small - screen PDAs and cell phones )
tty â For media using a fixed - pitch character grid , such as Teletypes , terminals , or portable devices with limited display capabilities
tv âFor television - type devices
We wo nât focus on these types because , while the reasoning behind them is good , support for their usage may be nonexistent .
However , we âll expand on the aural and handheld types in the section â Style Sheets for Other Media Types â later in this chapter .
Specifying the Media Type
Next , let âs look at how you can tell the user agent which medium ( or media ) the styles you are asking it to render should apply to .
Adding a media Attribute to the link Element
Arguably , the simplest method for linking to a style sheet is to use the link element , like so :
< link rel=" stylesheet " href="css/mainstylesheet.css " />
This code tells the user agent that the link is to a style sheet and where it can find the link ( css/mainstylesheet.css ) .
The user agent will then deal with the link however it sees fit .
You can , however , scope the use of the CSS contained in that style sheet with the media attribute :
< link rel=" stylesheet " href="css/mainstylesheet.css " media= " screen " />
In this example , only devices that will be displaying the content on a large screen will do anything with that style sheet .
And where screen is concerned , that pretty much means a PC ( Windows , Mac , Linux , etc. ) and a web browser ( Firefox , IE , and so on ) .
Adding a media Attribute to the @import Statement
If you are using the @import method for linking to a style sheet ( perhaps to throw older , non-standards - friendly browsers such as Netscape 4 off the scent ) , you could use the following syntax :
< style type =" text/css " > @import url( " /files/includes/css-/files/includes/print.cssstylesheet.css " )
/ files/includes /print.css ; </style >
There is a small problem with this approach , however : IE versions 6 and earlier wo nât deal with this syntax ( at the time of this writing , IE 7 did nât understand this construct either ) , so you âre probably going to have to use the previous method for linking wholesale to a CSS file .
Note :
You can place the @import statement in a style block as shown in the example , or you can embed that @import statement in another style sheet that is already linked to the document , but the @import statement must be at the beginning of that style sheet , not after any other CSS selectors .
Adding the Media to Specific Selectors within a Style Sheet
Finally , you can embed some media - specific styles within another style sheet like so :
< style type =" text /css " > body { font - size : 62.5 % ; } h1 { color : red ; } h2 { color : blue ; } @media / files / includes / print.css { h1 { color : black ; } h2 { color : gray ; } } </style >
Creating a Print Style Sheet
In our experience , the greatest use you âll have for different media types is with / files / includes / print.cssed output .
There are a few quirks to be aware of ( and we âll cover those ) , but it âs very well supported in general and can be put to great use .
We âve mentioned the various techniques that you can use to link to a style sheet with different media .
Our preference is to do the following :
Create a basic CSS file that contains generic visual styles that are understood by most browsers .
Avoid CSS layout and anything that could be considered intermediate - to - advanced CSS .
This CSS file is attached to the document using a link element but without specifying any media type whatsoever .
element but without specifying any media type whatsoever .
Create a second style sheet that is used for more advanced screen styles and use the @import statement embedded in the / files / includes / basic.css file to attach it .
Netscape 4 wo nât see this advanced file , but other newer browsers will .
statement embedded in the file to attach it .
Netscape 4 wo nât see this advanced file , but other newer browsers will .
Create a / files / includes / print.css -only style sheet and attach it using the link element with media= " / files/includes /print.css " .
Note :
You should declare the / files / includes / print.css style sheet last ( link to it even after any < style > </ style > block inside the HTML page ) .
If you declare the / files / includes / print.css style sheet first , you could undo any values set there in the subsequent generic style sheets if they are not scoped for screen or some other medium .
Translating that English into markup , we get this in the document :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > Simple / files / includes /print.css test</title > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=iso - 8859-1 " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " href="css//files/includes/basic.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " href="css//files/includes/print.css.css " media= " / files/includes/print.css " /> </head >
and in the basic CSS file :
@import url( " /files/includes/advanced.css " ) ;
What Do You Put in a Print CSS File ?
There are not any real hard - and - fast rules about what should or should nât go into a / files / includes / print.css CSS file .
However , let âs take a moment to consider some of the characteristics of the / files / includes / print.cssed format .
Keep in mind that in / files / includes / print.css you ca nât do the following :
Click on navigation items to take you to another piece of paper
Conduct a search or carry out a calculation
Zoom in or out on a map or resize text using a text widget of some kind
â E-mail this story to a friend â
Scroll the page
Send feedback
What you can do with / files / includes / print.css CSS is almost the reverse of the previous list :
Hide all navigation elements that are no longer any use
Hide search facilities or other interactive form elements
Hide controls that affect on - screen display
Hide links that spawn some browser or application functionality
In fact , anything that you can click on or interact with on screen may need some kind of alternative treatment for / files / includes / print.css .
Examples include hiding the element entirely or removing some display attribute that no longer works in the / files / includes / print.cssed format ( for example , removing underlines in body text links ) .
Note :
In most browsers , you do not need to be too concerned about dealing with background images that appear on screen ; they are usually set not to / files / includes / print.css by / files / includes / default.css and , as such , are unlikely to need any special / files / includes / print.css - only treatment .
One exception is Opera , which will / files / includes / print.css backgrounds out by / files / includes / default.css ( or at least it does in versions 8 and 9 that we tested ) , but this can easily be unset in the File Â» TRA Print Options menu .
If you have a sufficient number of Opera users , you might want to override background images for given elements , for example , body { background - image : none;} , so that users do not have to specify this for themselves â but it âs not a major consideration that you need to worry about .
One of the first things you should consider with a / files / includes / print.css layout is resetting any layout mechanisms you âve used for the screen view .
This involves removing floats , absolute positioning , padding , and margins .
Tips for Even Better Printed Pages
Our previous example showed a simple / files / includes / print.cssout that you can achieve by resetting certain CSS properties and redefining others .
There is more that you can do to improve matters , though :
Use serif fonts .
Because of the low resolution that monitors provide , and the fact that a large number of users do not have something like ClearType ( www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/Step1.aspx) enabled , small - sized serif fonts often look poor on screen â there simply are nât enough pixels available to render all the little flourishes ( or serifs ) at the ends of letters .
It âs no mistake that a large number of web sites use sans - serif fonts ( such as Verdana , Arial , and Helvetica ) on screen ; the lack of serifs makes them easier to render and thus easier to read .
On screen .
For the / files / includes / print.cssed version , though , you can quite easily use a serif font , such as Georgia or Times New Roman .
Serif fonts provide extra shape to the letters and can often help distinguish among similar - looking characters ; the serifs also create an implied horizontal line that âs supposed to aid readability .
If you âve lost background images for / files / includes / print.css , you might be able to work around this by including an inline image that is hidden in the main style sheet ( give it a unique id so that you can reference it ) with a display : none but is made visible in your / files / includes / print.css CSS file using display : block or display : inline .
The downside is that you are including an image that , for the vast majority of users , will not be seen but will still get downloaded to the client .
If that âs something that concerns you ( and it probably depends on how big the image is ) , you could use CSS - generated content to dynamically write in the image â for example , in the / files / includes / print.css style sheet , div.offer : after {content : " < img src='/files/includes/images/articles-css_styling_for_/files/includes/print.css_and_other_media-/files/includes/print.cssimage.gif ' alt =" Special offer " />" } .
But remember that IE 7 and earlier wo nât pay any attention to that code .
Certainly , the former technique enjoys better support .

Certainly , the former technique enjoys better support .
Bullet points missing ?
In the previous chapter , we suggested that applying background images was the best method for creating custom list item symbols .
When you / files / includes / print.css them , though , the images wo nât show .
For that reason you should redefine the display for / files / includes / print.css so that the image is attached using list - style - image ( or simply remove the custom bullet styles altogether and go with the basic styles that the browser would apply ) .
( or simply remove the custom bullet styles altogether and go with the basic styles that the browser would apply ) .
Provide special offers for / files / includes / print.cssouts .
While the browser will , by / files / includes / default.css , / files / includes / print.css information such as the date , URL , and page number , you can add custom information for the / files / includes / print.cssed version .
As an example , if on our travel site you found the perfect vacation and / files / includes / print.cssed out the details , you could include a / files / includes / print.css - only section on how to make a booking .
This section might include a telephone number and a reference number , while the screen view would instead display a link to the e-commerce section of the site to make an online booking .
Things to Watch Out For
With a little care and attention , you can create web pages that perfectly suit the / files / includes / print.cssed medium .
Yet be aware that there are some things you need to take into account .
Checking Your Page Width
If you have defined a width for your page using pixels , you will need to redefine that for / files / includes / print.css using a real - world measurement such as centimeters , millimeters , or inches .
Be sure to allow for the fact that the / files / includes / print.csser your site visitor is using may not be able to / files / includes / print.css right up to the edges .
If you take a US letter or A4 sized piece of paper , measure its width , then take off a couple of centimeters or a quarter inch from either side , that should give you a / files / includes / print.cssable page width .
Printing Errors with CSS Positioning
If you have reset all the positioning properties as suggested earlier in this chapter , you will probably not run into difficulties .
However , be sure to try / files / includes / print.cssing a web page with a lot of content â a page that you would expect to run into several / files / includes / print.cssed pages â to make sure that the entire web page / files / includes / print.csss .
Using floats and absolute position can affect the / files / includes / print.cssout , resulting in only the first page getting / files / includes / print.cssed .
If this happens , double - check the CSS for the container of the content that is being â clipped â and ensure that you have set float : none and position : static .
Note :
In case you âre wondering â What âs that static value ?
And why have nât we heard about it before ? â it âs because that âs the browser âs / files / includes / default.css positioning model .
You would not normally need to set this yourself â we only have to do this to get around a known / files / includes / print.cssing problem .
Getting Feedback About Your â Funny Printouts â
Despite all your hard work , someone is bound to ask , â Why does your page not / files / includes / print.css out properly ? â
Many users expect that what they see on screen will be replicated in the / files / includes / print.cssout .
Remember that you can use / files / includes / print.css CSS itself to address the issue ( e.g. , perhaps a block of text that reads â This page has been crafted for perfect / files / includes / print.cssing â¦ â that is hidden on screen but set as display : block for the / files / includes / print.cssed version ) .
Advanced Print CSS Techniques
Hiding and showing or restyling content dependent on the medium is fairly straightforward stuff once you âve grasped the basics .
In this section , we âll examine some more advanced features that introduce some extra dynamics into the usually static world of / files / includes / print.css .
This is where browser support can get a little flakier , though , so be sure to treat these as nice - to - haves , rather than as essential features that must be available to all browsers .
Inserting URLS in Printed Pages
The great thing about reading a web page with links is that when you see an underlined phrase you can click on that link and immediately investigate another avenue .
With that page / files / includes / print.cssed out , you have no way of following that link , so you have a couple of choices :
Suppress the underline ( or any other link styling , such as bold text ) for / files / includes / print.css so that it does nât get in the way needlessly ; there âs no point signifying a link that ca nât be followed .
Choose the opposite route â instead of hiding the link styling , expand on it and dynamically create a / files / includes / print.cssed version of the web address ( whatever is in that link âs href attribute ) .
The latter is definitely doable , but it requires some slightly advanced CSS ( not supported by IE 7 or earlier ) or a JavaScript solution .
Using Generated Content to Write Out the URL
Here is the basic CSS that does the job of writing out links on the page ( be sure to add this only to the / files / includes / print.css CSS file ) :
a : after { content : " ( " attr ( href ) " ) " ; }
This code tells the browser to get the value of an attribute ( the href attribute , as detailed in the parentheses ) and then place that value in a string that begins and ends with parentheses .
If you are familiar with JavaScript , it âs equivalent to
" ( " + this.getAttribute ( ' href ' ) + " ) "
but there is no concatenation symbol such as + or & .
In this example HTML :
< h3 > < a href= " /book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10079 " >
Building Flickr Applications with PHP </a> </h3 >
it would render on the / files / includes / print.cssed version like so :
Building Flickr Applications with PHP
( http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10079)
Tip :
You probably would nât want every link on the page to get this treatment , so you may want to scope it by using a contextual selector , for example # bodycontent a : after {content : " ( " attr ( href ) " ) " ;} .
When looking at a block of content , a long URL directly after the text can make it a little difficult to read , regardless of the benefit offered by having the reference there .
Would nât it be great if you could simply create a footnote from each link and just place a number after the link that references the footnote link ?
Well , you can thank Aaron Gustafson for devising a JavaScript technique that does just that , all ready for you to download and implement .
Selective Printing Using the DOM and CSS
One final advanced technique that you might like to consider is mixing together DOM scripting and CSS to create specific / files / includes / print.cssable areas of a page .
An example of how this works is a FAQ page that contains many blocks of content .
You might want to / files / includes / print.css only one section of that page ; by using JavaScript you can dynamically toggle display attributes of different sections so that only the part you want / files / includes / print.cssed is shown â but without affecting the screen view .
This is a fairly involved technique , which is covered thoroughly ( a chapter in its own right ! ) in another Apress book , Web Standards Creativity ( February 2007 ) , although you can also read about the technique online on my personal blog .
Style Sheets for Other Media Types
As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , the support for other media types is very spotty indeed , and what you can do with it is severely limited .
We wo nât explore all the various CSS property values that you can use with audio style sheets ( it âs highly unlikely that such a discussion would be of use to most readers ) , but we âll look at a few media types .
The Projection Media Type
Another media type that does have a modicum of support is projection .
As far back as version 4 , Opera has supported this type , but what does it do ?
Projection is intended for use with presentation versions of a web page ; all browser toolbars and the like are removed , and the information is presented in full screen .
A good example is S5 , a web - page - based presentation format that CSS guru Eric Meyer devised , and which is used by many web standards advocates throughout the world .
In Opera you trigger the Projection mode by choosing View Â» TRA Full Screen .
Firefox and IE will not render the projection content when viewed in full - screen mode , so you have to ask yourself :
What benefit can you get from using this ?
The Aural Media Type
With the aural CSS properties , you should be able to control the pitch , speed , tone , and other attributes for speech - synthesized versions of the web page to great effect , but support for this is very much lacking .
To date , we âve only seen ( or rather heard ) one good application of this : a plug - in for Firefox called Firevox , which is definitely worth downloading and checking out to see what should be possible with this technology .
You can find out more about the various CSS aural properties and values at the W3C ( www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html), or for a simpler example try the W3Schools introduction to this topic .
The Handheld Media Type
Another example of â great in theory , but almost useless in practice , â the handheld media type is perfect for specifying styles that can be used for a cell - phone - based browser , Blackberry , or similar device .
However , the mobile market ( phones in particular ) are almost a law unto themselves and have devised various strategies for rendering web pages in the struggle to gain a competitive edge .
At http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=HandheldStylesheets you âll find a quotation that pretty much sums up the sorry state of handheld support :
Some current phones apply â screen â styles as well as â handheld â styles , others ignore both , and in some cases the phone carrier runs pages through a proxy that strips styles out even if the phone could recognize them , so it âs a crapshoot figuring out what will get applied .
So , all bets are off !
It âs good to be aware that the media type exists and what its intended use is , but , seriously , do nât waste effort in trying to design a slick interface for a given handheld device and expect it to honor only your handheld styles and ignore the screen styles â and certainly do nât expect the next handheld to do the same .
The All Media Type
The all media type is pretty much superfluous .
If you want a style sheet to be rendered on all devices , you may just as well not set a media type at all and let the device , browser , or user agent work it out for itself .
Summary
The ability to create specific style sheets for different media seems , on the face of it , to be a very powerful tool .
However , in practice you are limited in what you can do .
It seems a shame to end on a sour note , but we hope the things that you can do with the / files / includes / print.css medium more than make up for the rest .
Now , if only the mobile market could decide on a standard and stick with it , we could do great things with those devices just as we can with the / files / includes / print.cssed medium .
Well , we can hope â and a good place to start is with Blue Flavor âs presentation on mobile web design .

I want to quit my job and travel around living in a van .
I like sleeping in enclosed spaces .
i dont like material possesions ..
i like simlicity and freedom - the idea of just writing and reading all day without owing my time to anyone .
I want to live cheaply .
I would sleep in the van at night but i wouldnt really spend much time in it .
I would park it either in or near a city or on the outskirts .
During the day
Id be in the public library ( where there are public restrooms ) .
Im from the cold northeast so I want to take my van south where the are warm cities , maybe arizona or southern california .
I dont want to freeze at night when im sleeping in my van .
The city would need to have good libraries .
I would park my van in empty parking lots or industrial lots or whatever i could find , so it would need to be inconspicuous and blend in so I wont get bothered by cops .
I am thinking either a dodge 1500 or a chevy express van because they are both cheap and look like the typical white service van .
I dont care about having windows or much space .
all i need is a sleeping bag , pillows and lots of books .
To wash clothes id take them to a laundromat and for showering i can get a gym membership .
Id buy a lot of rice and dry bulk food that you can cook just with water , you can make some nice meals with a bunsen burner stove , beans , soups , noodles etc .
I would get lots of batteries for reading light .
Im not doing this out of desperation because i'm broke .
The point is so that i can be FREE and not have expectations from anyone and to see if its possible to survive on my own and take care of myself without paying rent .
I do have 40 K set aside - i want to make it last as long as I can .
My question is , am i crazy ?
has anyone else had experience living out of a van in a city ?
what else do i need to worry about ?
hearing your stories would be very helpful !

Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon 's web - scale messaging infrastructure as a web service .
Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages without any installed software or special firewall configurations .
Reliable -
To prevent messages from being lost or becoming unavailable , all messages are stored redundantly across multiple servers and data centers .
Simple - Developers can utilize Amazon SQS queues by using only four APIs : CreateQueue , SendMessage , ReceiveMessage , and DeleteMessage .
The SOAP , REST and query APIs can be used with virtually any language and platform .
Scalable - Amazon SQS was designed to enable an unlimited number of computers to read and write and unlimited number of messages at any time .
Inexpensive - No up - front or fixed expenses .
The only cost of sending messages through Amazon SQS is a small per-message handling fee based on the size of a message .
Again pricing is based only on usage .
In high school , I worked at Bruegger 's Bagels ( after a natural food co-op and an Italian restaurant ) .
I was very good at constructing bagel sandwiches , and I enjoyed the work immensely .
Making great food for people to their satisfaction right in front of them is surprisingly fulfilling .
At the end of each shift , I knew that I was responsible for making about 100 tired , hungry people happier by filling them with great food and fresh coffee .
I was pretty good at it , too - probably in the top 10 % .
( I was a terrible busboy for the Italian place . )
But as much as I enjoyed the job , it did n't pay very much .
Fortunately , bagel - sandwich construction is not my only skill .
Like many other geeks , I 'm also incredibly good at designing , building , troubleshooting , and fixing computers - what I 'll collectively refer to as IT .
That job pays far more than Bruegger 's ever would , and my skills and knowledge are probably in the top 1 % of all people who do it for a living .
Except I do n't .
I have before .
During breaks and vacations in college , I would get extra money by taking as many IT jobs as I could .
But since graduation , I 've only accepted programming jobs .
At my current job , I write the back - end code for dynamic websites using a language easy enough for millions of people to easily learn it .
I 'm probably only in the top 10 % of all web developers , and the pay is similar to advanced IT work .
I 've completely walked away from a field in which I 'm incredibly skilled .
I 'm much better in IT than I am as a programmer .
But I do n't accept independent IT work anymore , and I minimize my IT duties as a web developer .
My resume contains minimal references to these skills , and I would reject any job offer for this field .
The addiction
I 'm not sure if it 's because I 'm a man , or because I 'm a geek , but I have an innate need to fix things .
It 's painful to see someone struggling with a stupid computer problem , or doing something incredibly inefficiently when I know there 's a better way , or believing some terrible myth that I know is wrong .
In the past , I 've grabbed any opportunity to fix everything , get the right products , and set things up properly .
It usually has n't gone well , taking up too much of my time and causing too much aggravation .
But the next time an opportunity would come , I 'd still jump at it .
Not anymore .
It 's very difficult to walk away from an IT situation in which I know I could help , but I 'm done with that world .
Now , I just sit back and listen to people spout off wrong information , unnecessarily waste truckloads of money , and live with inferior setups .
I pretend that I have neither opinion nor expertise , hiding my frustration , because I know it 's better for me .
Why ?
Good question .
In 2004 , I switched to using a Mac full - time .
I underwent a corresponding transition away from activities that I felt were wasteful of my time .
This could have been caused by the Mac awakening , or it could just be a part of growing up and living after college .
Building computers was fun .
But there 's not much work in building computers - nobody wants a computer without someone to support it ( and I sure do n't want that job ) .
I still love to build computers for myself , but I only need so many computers .
I also can't build Macs .
( Although I would love to . )
Fixing computers , however , was not fun .
Here 's how it usually went :
Decode the symptoms from the user 's terrible use of computer terms .
( I pity anyone who performs this step over the phone . )
Fight with hordes of spyware apps , viruses , and shortcomings in Windows to restore the computer to a clean , usable state .
Talk to the angry user 3 months later when the system is back to an unusable state , and convince them that this is not my fault and I am not obligated to come fix it for free .
Or , if I 'm lucky , the customer will be nice and I 'll just have to feel guilty accepting their money again to fix the same problem .
Go to step 1 .
Figure out why the server 's RAID array occasionally goes offline .
Comb through pages of awful Google search results to find awful mailing - list posts describing minor incompatibilities under specific circumstances using a slightly different kernel version than mine .
Call awful vendor support departments and convince them that my RAID card deserves a replacement and I should n't have to pay for its shipping , and trust me , I already went through all of these stupid troubleshooting steps that you 're making me repeat .
Eventually discover that this particular RAID card is slightly incompatible with this particular version of this particular distribution of this particular operating system under my specific circumstances , even though the vendor claimed it was compatible .
Buy a new card with overnight shipping , because it 's more important to get this server online tomorrow than to waste more hours troubleshooting this stupid problem that may never be fixed .
Go to step 1 .
Occasionally , I 'd get a different problem .
( Very occasionally .
99 % of computer repairs are the same problem .
The different problems are usually on servers . )
After a day of IT frustration , I 'd occasionally go home without fixing the problem .
It 's a terrible feeling to leave an unsolved problem at work , but eventually I 'd get hungry and tired and realize I could n't fix it that day .
I 'd get home late , look back at my day , and think , " What have I accomplished today ? "
That 's what killed it for me .
IT work is miserably unfulfilling .
It 's a constant stream of problems , bugs , shoddy hardware , half - assed software , idiotic users , and infuriating management .
The best you can hope for is a return to the original , clean , working state .
It 's nearly impossible to improve or build anything , and there 's no creativity - you just clean up other people 's messes , whether they 're the users in your company or the programmers at Microsoft .
IT people are glorified janitors .
But janitors are usually nicer people to work with .
At least janitors tend to be decent at their jobs .
IT is filled with people who think they know how to do their jobs , but trust me , they do n't .
I 've heard far more misinformation come out of people 's mouths in this field than from all of the new - age crackpots who came into the natural food co-op in high school .
It 's hard to work in a field where all of your coworkers are idiots .
The aftermath
I still have a PC at home , but it sits idle most of the time .
Its Windows installation is a mess , but I do n't care enough to format and reinstall .
( I used to do that every 6 months for fun . )
When people ask me if I can fix their computers , I lie and say I do n't know anything about Windows PCs .
( Nobody ever asks me to fix their Mac .
Take from that what you will . )
I 'm far more satisfied doing a fulfilling job decently instead of doing a soul - sucking job nearly perfectly .
To all IT people who are n't idiots ( do n't worry , you 'll never know for sure either way ) , I commend you for your patience and persistence .
But that 's not for me .
Not at all .
And I 'm relieved to be out of it .
US Politics US Democracy Under Threat
The global economy is set to start shrinking as the supply of oil goes into decline .
Big business will fight ruthlessly to protect their share of the pie .
By Ryan McGreal
Published October 06 , 2006
I 've long been concerned with developments south of the border , but in the past I consoled myself that America has flirted with domestic fascism before and eventually righted itself .
This time it may be different : for the first time , the long global trajectory of economic growth is on the cusp of a permanent reversal .
A Century of Progress
Even during the darkest days of WWI , the Great Depression , WWII , and the Cold War , the world was getting richer , the total global production and consumption of energy was increasing , and " Progress " ( with a capital P ) still seemed the order of the day .
These crises were seen as the last great lurches of a dying imperial order that had run its course and grown unstable .
Even the Great Depression was seen mainly as a misguided overreaction to the bursting of a vast financial bubble that had not yet been subjected to the sophisticated regulatory tools that today allow people like US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to wield godlike powers .
Through all this , global economic output grew steadily as the net flow of usable energy increased at around two or three percent a year .
It was easy to struggle for universal civil rights when there was enough energy to go around and you did n't need slaves , serfs , or sharecroppers anymore .
It was comparatively easy to struggle for social justice .
For the first time in history , there was plenty to go around .
Poor , unbearable shanties in the rural South suddenly became livable , thanks to air conditioners and motor vehicles , all powered by cheap , abundant fossil fuels .
Rotting northern industrial cities emptied into their hinterlands , levelled and paved and bristling with new single houses .
The movement to universalize the basic trappings of modern life gained traction , and with the infrastructure of Roosevelt 's New Deal in place , corporate America signed onto a bargain in which industry reluctantly accepted full employment policies and high wages in exchange for steady growth .
Backlash
Then , starting in the 1970s with the OPEC oil shocks , North American industries and their lobbying groups and think tank " institutes " went on the offensive , fighting back against egalitarianism and steadily clawing away at the gains the social justice movement had achieved .
Over the next three decades , big business pressure slashed corporate taxes , froze minimum wages , rolled back unionization , and cut budgets for education , health care , and public infrastructure .
In that period , nearly all the wealth increases have gone to the top ten percent of Americans , of whom the top one percent has taken the largest share .
Executive salaries have soared , while the size of the poor underclass has grown , eating into the middle class while median incomes have stalled and declined .
Today , cities are crumbling , public schools struggle with inadequate resources , and in the US , some 47 million people have no comprehensive health care coverage .
When the next big recession hits , the basic protections built up over half a century will no longer exist .
At the same time , elections have turned into hundred million dollar extravaganzas of public manipulation .
What used to be considered influence peddling has been normalized in the US Congress , with " registered " lobbyists and overt corruption .
Illusory Growth
Since 2000 , if you exclude the booming health care industry , the net change in employment in the private sector has been strongly negative .
The boom in home construction , fueled by the housing bubble that grew out of Alan Greenspan 's rock - bottom interest rates early in the decade , has produced some low - skilled construction jobs .
However , that has not been enough to counteract the net decline in manufacturing work .
Even the much - ballyhooed " information economy " , which was supposed to replace manufacturing jobs with a new generation of high - skilled tech jobs , has generated almost zero net jobs since the tech bubble burst in 2000 .
The US federal government is hemorrhaging around three hundred billion dollars a year , plus deficits at the state and municipal level .
This year , the US economy will import close to $ 800 billion more in goods and services than it exports .
In an ominous echo of the 1998 collapse of Long Term Capital Management , another hedge fund has just failed .
Amaranth Advisors , Inc. pulled the plug after a month - long collapse , losing $ 6 billion dollars .
Banks are scrambling to insulate themselves from the fallout , but this is another sign of growing volatility .
Ironically , Amaranth collapsed because a trader bet that natural gas futures for March - April 2007 would continue to rise .
Instead the futures share price dropped by four - fifths on the strength of a mild hurricane season and reports of a warm winter .
A Geological Date with Destiny
In the context of this volatile political milieu , consider the effects of peak oil , the period at which half the world 's conventional petroleum reserves have been consumed .
After the peak , total oil production goes into an inexorable decline .
Many geologists believe the peak is happening now , and point as early evidence to the fact that this year 's total global oil production has fallen compared to last year 's , for the first time since the 1970s .
While the earlier production declines were political - the first because OPEC cut production , and the second because Iran overthrew its government and stopped oil production - today 's decline is geological .
When the total output of oil is growing , we can trust market forces to allocate that oil more or less fairly .
When the total output is shrinking but the world 's largest buyer refuses to pay the scarcity premium or consume less , then it must circumvent the market and secure a steady supply by force - and to hell with the rest of the world .
Oil Price Volatility
The price of oil has risen steadily since its 1999 low of $ 18 per barrel to a high of $ 75 per barrel in mid-2006 because demand has grown steadily but production could not increase to match it .
Reserve margins in the oil industry fell to zero over this time , and even Saudi Arabia , the world 's oil producing powerhouse , admits it has passed its production peak .
Lately , high prices have destroyed some of the demand for oil , particularly in poorer countries , and investors fear that the US will go into a recession next year , so the price has fallen near $ 60 per barrel , which feels like a break today but is still over three times higher than in 1999 .
Cornucopian economists will point to today 's falling prices as proof that there 's no oil shortage and that the market works just fine , thank you very much .
However , peak oil theory actually predicts several years of exactly this kind of price volatility as the production ceiling repeatedly destroys demand via high prices .
When the demand drops , the price falls ; the lower price , in turn , restores a demand that the physical capacity of the oil industry cannot meet .
Each time demand bounces off the global peak in production , the new baseline of wealth will be a little lower than before , the security of the middle class less certain , the desperation of the poor more acute .
Bad Times Ahead
This bodes very badly for struggling people the world over .
If big business fought back fiercely against public spending when economic growth merely slowed , how fierce and unrelenting will they be once the economy actually starts to shrink in real terms ?
How hard will they push the government to repress and resist the social justice movement when that pie starts shrinking ?
We already face attempts to tie the social justice and environemental movements to the so - called War on Terrorism .
If domestic resistance to US policy escalates beyond timid protests , apolitical unions , and " free speech zones " , will the US government be able to resist characterizing protests as terrorist acts ?
When there 's plenty of food to go around , enough is left to toss some scraps to the hounds to keep them happy .
But when there 's not so much to go around and there are no scraps , you have to beat the dogs to keep them quiet .
Once they become too desperate and unruly to silence with threats and repression , you have to kill them .
I fear we 're in for ugly times ahead .

Right this second , there are five books sitting on my desk .
I âm not talking about the invisible books stacked up next to my monitor , I âm talking about the books I want you to see the second you walk in my office .
They change over time , but right now they are :
My degree is in Computer and Information Science .
I spent four years grinding on the basics of developing software , yet , strangely , there are no programming books on my desk I do have these books , stuffed on nearby bookshelves , but these are not the books I pick up when I have five random minutes .
I pick up the architecture book and read the blurb about the Canary Wharf Underground Station in London .
It describes a subway station design with a high degree of visual transparency between floors which means there is very little need for supplementary signage .
I spend the rest of the day staring at signs and absorbing the irony that while signs are trying to make my life easier ; they exist because of basic deficiencies in design .
Yes , I âm a wannabe designer .
It started four years ago when I opened my first iPod and read the following :
â Designed by Apple in California . â
This is not marketing ; this is advice .
Designers Need Developers to Make Their Products
I listed the top three themes from SXSW a couple months back , but the entry did not capture the holy shit I took from Austin .
SXSW is a gathering of music , movie , and interactive enthusiasts .
On the plane to Texas , the game of figuring out which person belonged to the different aspects of the conference began â¦
Yeah , the music folks look like music folks â¦ edgy â¦ arty .
The movie folks dripped with glamour and intense LA energy .
What about the interactive folks ?
Wait , what does interactive actually mean ?
I still do nât know .
My impression is the interactive portion of SXSW is a mutated version of what used to be the multimedia portion of the conference .
You remember this fad , right ?
When everyone got crazy about pouring all sorts of content onto CDs and Macromedia Director was king ?
Developers were scratching their collective heads during these times because no one was inviting them to multimedia conferences .
Their thought , â They âre building software , right ? â
Wrong .
The multimedia types were thinking , â It âs bigger than software , MAN â¦
We âre building complex interactive multimedia experiences .
It âs not ones and zeros , MAN â¦ it âs SOOOOOOUUUUUUL . â
Right .
So , it âs software .
Simply because creatives could hide from software engineers behind their authoring tools did nât mean they were nât developing software .
It just meant they had a comfortable space to live in where they could design , not program .
Over the past few years , someone started inviting developers to SXSW .
Designers discovered that whiz bang Web 2.0 technology heavily intersected with their domain , but they also found the tools were primal .
There is no Director for developing web applications because everyone is still trying to figure this shit out .
Designers have two choices .
Either dip their feet into the programming pool and learn this frontier technology , or figure out how to speak developer .
This leads to part of the beauty of this year âs SXSW .
Tables full of passionate designers and developers .
Both parties buying each other drinks and silently staring across the table thinking , â Shit , I really need this guy , but I totally do nât speak his language . â
Which leads us to â¦
Developers Need Designers to Make Their Products Work
The third hire at the start - up was an interaction designer , Barney .
When I arrived several months later , I thought , â Swell , someone to make pretty pictures of my product .
That âll sure make presentations easier because I suck at drawing . â
In our first design meeting , I was shocked when Barney was running the meeting and there was nât a pretty picture to be seen .
He had these low - fidelity wireframe designs of the product that were nât at all fun to to look at .
After twenty minutes of staring at them , I realized they described how our product fit together .
Me : â Wait wait , wait , Barney , page two â¦
Are you sure that âs how it âs supposed to work ?
That makes no sense to me . â
Barney : â Rands , you are nât the customer .
I âll explain why . â
In the months before I arrived at the start - up , Barney had gotten into the the head of our target customers .
He âd spent weeks onsite withpotential clients and he grilled them and he captured every nugget of truth about what they cared about .
Three years later , Barney was long gone , and we were still flipping through his specifications â¦ searching for inspiration .
Barney âs lesson was simple .
Design for the customer .
It does nât matter if it âs HTML , C , Python , or Ruby on Rails .
Your job as a developer of software is to build software which works for human beings and there are conferences full of bright people who are well versed in cognitive psychology , usability , visual design principles , and art .
The problem is you are nât going to these conferences and soaking in their experience .
It turns out that is a career limiting move for both of us .
You Canât Offshore Art
There is a person sitting somewhere on the planet Earth who is capable of doing your job for a lot less money .
I know what I said , jobs which lend themselves to a well defined process will be the first to go , but that will change .
Each year that passes , more technology and infrastructure spreads across the globe and anyone with a computer and connection to the Internet has a chance to build the skills to develop software .
If someone figures out a useful way to integrate remote workers as a team , the Silicon Valley software developer has a problem .
How do you compete with an equally skilled developer who is willing to do your job for half the cost ?
Do you know what the biggest expense is for a software development company ?
That âs right , it âs your salary .
If I could figure out how to effectively engage a remote team , I could build a virtual team of developers that could be twice the size of my local team , but I wo nât do that because I âm not hiring developers for my next start - up .
I âm hiring designers .
When I âm building up the next development team , each of my hires will need to demonstrate they can talk maniacally about a slice of design .
Maybe they âll care deeply about color theory ?
Architecture ?
Interaction design ?
I do nât care , but they must be passionate about something other than writing fast , bug - free code because software is art .
We do nât need another Microsoft Word , we need the next word processor and that âs going to come from a small group of people with a delicious interdisciplinary mix of design and development skills .
So , take a small leap .
If you have nât already , go buy this book .
It âs full of bite - sized design ideas .
Soak in it and prepare for your next job .
What caused the high rates of economic growth in Botswana from the 1960s to the 1990s ?
Was it good leadership alone , or was it good leadership combined with the " lack of an exploitative colonial legacy " that allowed " pre-colonial institutions that encouraged cooperation , tolerated dissent , and ... provided solid support for the development of a mature civil society " to survive ?
This is from Andrew Leonard at Salon :
The battle of Dimawe , by Andrew Leonard , Salon : ... Botswana is an African mystery -- for 30 years , from the 1960s to the 1990s , it boasted the fastest growing economy in the world .
In 1965 , at the moment of independence , it was the third poorest nation in the world .
In 2001 , per capita income was $ 7,280 , placing it squarely in the ranks of the world 's upper - middle - income nations , leaps and bounds beyond the vast majority of its sub-Saharan brethren .
It is rated the least corrupt country in Africa , has a rock - solid credit rating , and substantial foreign reserves .
A country the size of Texas with a population of 1.6 million , Botswana is no paradise .
Inequality and unemployment are high , and AIDS is a nightmare .
But in a continent of failed states , Botswana is a beacon .
How did it do it ?
And can its example be copied ?
There seems to be near universal agreement that good leadership and sound policy choices were critical to Botswana 's success .
The first president of Botswana , Seretse Khama , a tribal chieftain educated at Balliol College in the U.K. , is widely credited with being a great leader .
Taxation rates have historically been low and rule by law effective .
The prudent use of revenues from Botswana 's lucrative diamond mines to fund government expenditure was also crucial .
But the most interesting question is whether Khama and Botswana benefited from historically contingent forces related to colonialism that ended up giving the country a leg up .
" An African Success Story : Botswana , " by Daron Acemoglu , Simon Johnson and James Robinson ( three economists , two from MIT and one from Harvard ) , argues that the Tswana tribes enjoyed pre-colonial institutions that encouraged cooperation , tolerated dissent , and in general provided solid support for the development of a mature civil society .
Due to a unique set of historical circumstances , those institutions survived the colonial era .
...
Distracted by the rest of their empire , convinced that there was nothing to be gained from direct exploitation , [ Britain ] left the Tswana essentially to themselves .
Whereas elsewhere in Africa , colonial incursions by the British , the French and , most notoriously , King Leopold 's Belgians in the Congo made havoc of whatever pre-colonial institutions existed , typically practicing divide - and - rule strategies that set tribe against tribe , setting in place resentments that have lasted to this day , with awful consequences .
The theory put forth by Acemoglu et al. is not holy writ .
In " Explaining Botswana 's Success : The Critical Role of a Post - Colonial Policy , " Scott Beaulier , an assistant professor of economics at Mercer University , takes direct issue with the thesis .
Beaulier argues that the policy choices of Khama were far more important than the lack of an exploitative colonial legacy , and that much of the rest of Africa 's failures can be laid at the door of bad leaders who went down ill - fated Marxist paths .
Historical arguments that attempt to explain economic success ( or failure ) can rarely be settled , one way or another .
But in this corner , attempts to explain away the impact of colonialism on Africa are viewed with suspicion .
Great historical crimes do mean something .
...
In the contemporary debate over how to nurture economic development , Africa often gets the worst of it , blamed for its failures because of its own mistakes .
And no doubt about it , mistakes have been made aplenty .
Nor are there any easy answers offering a road map to ridding oneself of corruption or escaping the poverty trap .
But Botswana does offers a counter - example , a model for what can happen when good leaders make good decisions in an environment where traditional social structures survive intact in the face of Western imperial domination .
It is not at all clear how to apply the Botswana model to other countries with more tragic histories , but at the very least , a contemplation of its circumstances gives rise to hope .

If you âre tired of the old clichÃ© that information is power , here âs a new one : Disinformation is every bit as powerful .
That much we know from the mischievous email that was apparently sent out to Apple employees and that â naturally â quickly found its way into the tech - news cycle via the respected and highly trafficked tech site Engadget .
The terse email said simply that the iPhone would be delayed to October from June and that the OS X Leopard operating software would not be released until January .
( Apple declined to offer any comment beyond reiterating that the email â was nât authentic â and that both the iPhone and Leopard are on track as previously announced . )
That was enough to cause Apple âs stock to tumble 5 % from its morning high .
It took only seven minutes for Apple to fall to its intraday low of $ 103.42 from $ 108.83 .
Apple was trading below $ 105 for only two minutes , but in those two minutes more than 2.2 million shares were traded .
In the volatile 23 minutes of turmoil between the minute the disinformation hit the stock market at 8:55 PST and Apple âs announcement that the initial email â is fake and did not come from Apple , â nearly 15 million shares changed hands .
That âs 60 % of Apple âs normal volume in well under a half hour .
That âs also an awful lot money lost for some investors â and gained for others â all of it because of a lie .
There are two things about this that are interesting :
The practice itself , seeding the stock market with deceptive news that moves prices , is usually reserved for over - the - counter stocks , where a frantic post on a hyperactive message board can cause illiquid stocks to rise or fall five or 10 percent in less than a day .
But Apple , with an average trading volume of 25 million shares a day , is no penny stock .
And yet , given all the hype that has surrounded the iPhone since January you âd have to think long and hard to come up with a piece of fake - news that would cause , in a matter of seconds , more investors ( and Apple fanboys ) to lose control of their anal sphincter muscles than this rumor did .**
The other notable twist is in how the fake news was spread .
It seems someone figured out how to send an email to Apple employees around the world , putting the familiar â Bullet News â in the from line ( for Apple âs sake , one hopes this is not as simple as sending an email to â [ email protected ] â ) .
A week ago , I noted how H - P pre-announced key earnings data after a non-employee had been emailed access to the market - moving numbers .
This incident is the dark side of the same phenomenon :
An email leads to investors being broadsided with surprising news , only this time the message is false .
And the fallout ?
Apple reacted as swiftly and judiciously as H - P did .
The SEC would do right to take this as seriously as they do backdated stock options , and look into who may have profited from shorting the stock ahead of the news .
And there is also already debate about how Engadget handled the news .
Some say it just ran with what an Apple employee sent in ; others say it could have benefited from double - checking with Apple .
But let âs not forget that only 11 days ago , the New York Post , the country âs 13th oldest newspaper , ran the rapidly discredited news of a Microsoft - Yahoo merger .
That fake news drove Yahoo âs stock up 19 % , and most of those gains have since eroded away .
The SEC has its work cut out for it .
But what really stands out for me in this bizarre but fascinating episode is that Apple investors were taken by a technological goof that could have happened a decade ago but that in 2007 is like being sold the Eiffel Tower .
If the irrational hopes surrounding the iPhone had not gotten so overheated , this would never have happened .

The brain contains stem cells with a surprising capacity for repair , researchers report in recent issue of the journal Cell .
The novel insight into the brain âs natural ability to heal might ultimately have clinical implications for the treatment of brain damage , according to the researchers .
The researchers found that mice whose brains were severely damaged by loss of the genes â Numb â and â Numblike â in one region just after birth showed substantial mending within weeks .
They attributed that repair to neural stem cell â escapees â that had somehow retained or restored the genes â activity and , with it , their regenerative potential .
â At two weeks , the knockout animals â brains had developed a big hole , â said Yuh - Nung Jan , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of California , San Francisco .
â We thought that the mice would not live long , but by four weeks , the hole was largely repaired and the animals survived .
â It was a big surprise .
It was not known that the brain has this kind of ability to repair itself . â
Jan and his colleagues first discovered Numb in the fruit fly Drosophila more than 10 years ago .
The gene was found by them and others to play a role in determining the fate of neuroblasts , cells that develop into neurons or other support cells in the insects â brains .
Later , researchers found two functionally related mammalian proteins , dubbed Numb and Numblike , to be critical in the development of neurons in embryonic mice .
To investigate the genes â role after birth , Jan âs team developed mice in which Numb and Numblike could be turned off only in a portion of the brain termed the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) when they administered a particular drug .
The SVZ is known to be a site , or niche , that contains neural stem cells after birth .
In newborn mice , loss of the genes left the SVZ â greatly disturbed , â Jan said .
Their results indicated that Numb and Numblike have two important functions , namely a role in the survival of neuroblasts and an unexpected role in maintaining the cellular wall that lines the ventricular region of the brain in which the SVZ resides .
Without the normal complement of genes , that wall â disintegrated , â he said , leaving holes in the brain .
Surprisingly , they reported , the ventricular damage was eventually repaired .
SVZ reconstitution and remodeling of the ventricular wall was driven by progenitor cells that escaped Numb deletion , they found .
â Although the exact mechanisms are still being worked upon , these observations raise the possibility that postnatal neurogenesis can one day be used to repair brain damage , â the researchers concluded .
â Our results here show that self - repair and local remodeling can indeed happen along the brain âs lateral ventricular wall , and further insights into this process should shed light on whether SVZ neural stem cells participate in stroke / trauma - induced brain remodeling and postnatal / adult brain tumor formation .
Furthermore , understanding how the SVZ cells participate in local repair should help bring us closer to the goal of using neural stem cells as therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative diseases . â

Mrs. Satan
By now you 'll be asking why these jihadist wannabes did n't conspire simply to bring TATP onto planes , colored with a bit of vegetable dye , and disguised as , say , a powdered fruit - flavored drink .
The reason is that they would be afraid of failing : TATP is notoriously sensitive and unstable .
Mainstream journalists like to tell us that terrorists like to call it " the mother of Satan . "
( Whether this reputation is deserved , or is a consequence of homebrewing by unqualified hacks , remains open to debate . )
It 's been claimed that the 7/7 bombers used it , but this has not been positively confirmed .
Some sources claim that they used C - 4 , and others that they used RDX .
Nevertheless , the belief that they used TATP has stuck with the media , although going about in a crowded city at rush hour with an unstable homebrew explosive in a backpack is not the brightest of all possible moves .
It 's surprising that none of the attackers enjoyed an unscheduled launch into Paradise .
So , assuming that the homebrew variety of TATP is highly sensitive and unstable - or at least that our inept jihadists would believe that - to avoid getting blown up in the taxi on the way to the airport , one might , if one were educated in terror tactics primarily by hollywood movies , prefer simply to dump the precursors into an airplane toilet bowl and let the mother of Satan work her magic .
Indeed , the mixture will heat rapidly as TATP begins to form , and it will soon explode .
But this wo n't happen with much force , because little TATP will have formed by the time the explosion occurs .
We asked University of Rhode Island Chemistry Professor Jimmie C. Oxley , who has actual , practical experience with TATP , if this is a reasonable assumption , and she tolds us that merely dumping the precursors together would create " a violent reaction , " but not a detonation .
To release the energy needed to bring down a plane ( far more difficult to do than many imagine , as Aloha Airlines Flight 243 neatly illustrates ) , it 's necessary to synthesize a good amount of TATP with care .
Jack Bauer sense
So the fabled binary liquid explosive - that is , the sudden mixing of hydrogen peroxide and acetone with sulfuric acid to create a plane - killing explosion , is out of the question .
Meanwhile , making TATP ahead of time carries a risk that the mission will fail due to premature detonation , although it is the only plausible approach .
Certainly , if we can imagine a group of jihadists smuggling the necessary chemicals and equipment on board , and cooking up TATP in the lavatory , then we 've passed from the realm of action blockbusters to that of situation comedy .
It should be small comfort that the security establishments of the UK and the USA - and the " terrorism experts " who inform them and wheedle billions of dollars out of them for bomb puffers and face recognition gizmos and remote gait analyzers and similar hi-tech phrenology gear - have bought the Hollywood binary liquid explosive myth , and have even acted upon it .
We 've given extraordinary credit to a collection of jihadist wannabes with an exceptionally poor grasp of the mechanics of attacking a plane , whose only hope of success would have been a pure accident .
They would have had to succeed in spite of their own ignorance and incompetence , and in spite of being under police surveillance for a year .
But the Hollywood myth of binary liquid explosives now moves governments and drives public policy .
We have reacted to a movie plot .
Liquids are now banned in aircraft cabins ( while crystalline white powders would be banned instead , if anyone in charge were serious about security ) .
Nearly everything must now go into the hold , where adequate amounts of explosives can easily be detonated from the cabin with cell phones , which are generally not banned .
Action heroes
The al - Qaeda franchise will pour forth its bowl of pestilence and death .
We know this because we 've watched it countless times on TV and in the movies , just as our officials have done .
Based on their behavior , it 's reasonable to suspect that everything John Reid and Michael Chertoff know about counterterrorism , they learned watching the likes of Bruce Willis , Jean - Claude Van Damme , Vin Diesel , and The Rock ( whose palpable homoerotic appeal it would be discourteous to emphasize ) .
It 's a pity that our security rests in the hands of government officials who understand as little about terrorism as the Florida clowns who needed their informant to suggest attack scenarios , as the 21/7 London bombers who injured no one , as lunatic " shoe bomber " Richard Reid , as the Forest Gate nerve gas attackers who had no nerve gas , as the British nitwits who tried to acquire " red mercury , " and as the recent binary liquid bomb attackers who had no binary liquid bombs .
For some real terror , picture twenty guys who understand op - sec , who are patient , realistic , clever , and willing to die , and who know what can be accomplished with a modest stash of dimethylmercury .
You wo n't hear about those fellows until it 's too late .
Our official protectors and deciders trumpet the fools they catch because they have n't got a handle on the people we should really be afraid of .
They make policy based on foibles and follies , and Hollywood plots .
Meanwhile , the real thing draws ever closer . Â®
CEO Steve Jobs launched Apple 's iPhone last month
Last month Apple announced its forthcoming iPod - based mobile phone would be called iPhone , but Cisco had registered it in 2000 .
Under the deal , they will also work together in the areas of security , consumer and business communications .
The financial terms of the agreement have not been released .
Cisco has already been marketing its own iPhone
In a joint statement , Cisco and Apple said both companies could use the word iPhone on their products worldwide .
All lawsuits connected with dispute have been dismissed .
Cisco had argued that Apple 's use of the iPhone name was a " wilful and malicious " violation of a trademark it had held since 2000 , when it acquired another company , Infogear .
Infogear 's original filing for the trademark dated back to 20 March , 1996 .
Cisco's Linksys division has been producing a range of wireless VoiP phones under the name since 2006 .
Apple unveiled its iPhone at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco in January .
Mike , over at What Really Happened , in a breathless little bit of outrage , proclaims â The Iranian 81 mm mortar page is a fake ! â .
His proof ?
Apparently incorrect WHOIS data , typographic errors ( in English ) , and the IP address belonging to an Iranian college .
Never mind it âs a government - run college with some very shady programs ; that âs good enough for him to discount it as fake â¦ and for Kurt Nimmo to retract his retraction .

Scourge of the Computing Industry
Microsoft .
We all know them .
A lot of us hate them .
We can all give reasons , of course ; some technical , some philosophical , some economic , some moral , some just plain emotional .
Of course , it 's a difficult case .
Too many people just get stuck on " Yes , but they 're making money " , and stop listening at that point .
Other people do n't even get that far , and stay with " They 're popular " , or even the dreaded " They made it possible for anybody to use a computer " , or other catchphrases which tend to just derail real arguments .
And it 's not because they 're valid points , it 's because they 're practically impossible to address ; they 're perfectly valid points , but in a totally different context than the one the arguments are in .
Where to start ?
So , I 'm starting fresh .
I 'm delivering the following assertion :
Windows has significantly set back and held back the IT industry , and continues to do so .
Windows encourages , rewards , and practically demands stupidity on the part of its users , and further attempts to force such on anybody who has to deal with the users .
I do n't care what you think of them as a business ; everybody and their mother , including me , will agree that they 're doing a great job of running a business .
If you feel it necessary to take the stated stupidity as an insult , you might as well just stop here .
It 's not an insult .
It 's a statement .
Stupidity is not an insult .
If you do n't know something , you 're stupid about that something .
I 'm pretty stupid about automotive engineering .
I 'm pretty stupid about plexiglass manufacturing , animal husbandry , agriculture , and biochemistry .
If you do n't understand computers , you 're stupid about computers .
You 're not bloody well " computer illiterate " .
It 's a copout phrase , and the only reason to use a copout phrase is to attempt to delude other people and / or yourself .
Admit it ; you 're stupid about computers .
It 's not a stigma , it 's an admission , and it's a positive thing .
It means " I do n't know this " , which should n't be seen as a negative , but as a positive .
It 's not a void , it 's a void ready to be filled with knowledge .
OK , I 'm stupid .
Now what ?
Well , that 's what this rant is about .
This is not " How to use computers " .
This is not an instruction in the curing of that stupidity .
What I 'm going to do is explain how Microsoft in general and Windows in particular are encouraging and spreading the stupidity which has infested this industry .
I 'm also going to generalize a bit , and talk about some general concepts such as " user - friendliness " , and try to explain the ways in which they can be expanded to really serve us the people , rather than vice versa .
For a more in - depth treatment of user - friendliness , see my What User Friendly Means rant .
Onward and Upward
So , where to start ?
There 's actually a broad range of general topics at issue here .
There 's a lot of learning theory and behavioral psychology .
I 'm not a behavioral psychologist ; I 'm just watching what 's happening in the IT industry with constant alarm .
The first thing , is the concept of learning curves , and their effect on long - term usage .

Are you exhausted and looking for better sleep tips for new moms ..?
I know exactly how you feel !
As a new mom , it can be really hard to get the sleep you need .
Who cares if things get better when my baby is three months old ?
I will have died from lack of sleep by then !
That âs really how I felt getting my first child .
I was so exhausted !
Looking back now at my first time as a new mother , I did nât do much to improve the situation at that time .
Why ?
I did nât know what to do !
â Sleep when the baby does also at daytime â was the only advice I heard .
Easy to say !
Boring and hard to do .
I mean , you âre not a robot as a new mom ; there âs no off - button to press as soon as the baby falls asleep !
When I was home with our third child things were different .
Tired â yes sometimes .
Like when all kids woke up at night â¦
But I was not exhausted ; not at all actually .
Why ?
Because I had learned how to help myself getting much more sleep .
Below I âve gathered and explained the sleep tips for new moms I used to maximize my own sleep when our third child was a young baby .
Pick the ones you like the most .
If you have additional ideas on how to get some sleep as a new mom , please share them at the end of the article , to help other exhausted moms .
Helpful Sleep Tips for New Moms
Dreamfeed when YOU go to bed
To be honest , this wo nât help your baby sleep better , but it will give you more undisturbed sleep .
If you make sure that your baby is full when you go to sleep , chances are that you will get a few undisturbed hours when they are the most important .
I really hate to be awakened an hour or so after falling asleep in the evening .
How to do it ?
Take your baby up very gently to not wake him up .
Sit comfortably in the dark and place his mouth on your nipple ( or the bottle ) .
Push lightly .
If necessary open his mouth gently and wait .
If he does nât react , move around a little bit to disturb him .
It might take a few minutes especially the first times , but he âll learn .
For more details on how to dreamfeed your baby , click here .
Afterward , New Mom will have a full , sleeping baby , which hopefully will not call for your attention for a few hours .
While he eats listen carefully if he seems to be swallowing air .
If not ( many babies do nât when eating in their sleep ) , you do nât even have to burp him before putting him to bed again .
Co-sleep
Not until with our youngest child did I learn how to breastfeed lying down without hurting my neck and back .
The trick is to place the baby much lower than you might think .
He is supposed to have to really stretch his neck to reach your nipple .
Co-sleeping and nursing in bed are likely to mean that you fall asleep while feeding your child .
This means a lot less time awake than if you sit up .
Also , the milk tends to flow more slowly this way , preventing your baby from swallowing as much air .
Burping might therefore not be necessary .
Double bonus !
Over time , as we taught our baby to sleep better , the disadvantages of having him in our bed started to dominate .
( Like having this little fence ( the boy ) between me and my husband â¦
;- D) Then it is time to start putting him back in his own bed after nursing .
Ideally ( I think ) you should start doing this as early as possible at least once a night so that he gets used to sleeping in his own bed too .
A word of warning .
Some studies indicate a higher incidence of SIDS ( Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ) when children sleep in their parents â bed .
( Other studies indicate the opposite . )
Remember to consult your care provider in this matter and never ever have your baby sleep with you in your bed if you or your spouse have consumed alcohol !
For a more detailed checklist on safe co-sleeping , click here .
Dad âs night UP !
I like this one ! :-)
Someone told me ( do nât know if it âs true ) that a new mom wakes up on average every third minute to check on her newborn .
That is some 160 times a night !!
The mother does nât remember more than maybe 6 or 7 times , but guess what â she gets really tired .
So , every now and then , go to bed early with earplugs .
If possible even sleep in your own room .
Let dad take care of the waking up at night and let him carry the baby to you for nursing .
If your baby is bottlefed , then dad takes care of the feeding that night .
If possible even let him handle the burping ( whether the baby is breastfed or not ) .
Chances are you will only wake up a few times instead of 160 â¦
Let dad handle the first nighttime feeding
Being a new mom , a friend of mine used to put her baby to bed at 8 PM .
Then she went to bed at 9 PM and let her husband bottle feed their infant at 11 PM .
That meant that she had undisturbed sleep from 9 PM to 2 am without asking her husband to take responsibility at night .
Great !
This can be done even if you breastfeed ( and even if your husband has to be able to think clearly the day after ) .
Pump just before you go to bed .
The milk can be stored in the refrigerator for several hours without deteriorating .
Or you can use formula if appropriate for your child .

A cradle and a rope
When I was a baby , my dad tied a rope around my bassinet and hung it on a hook in the ceiling .
Then he could pull the rope from his bed to rock my home - made cradle .
Instead of making your own hanging cradle , which seems a bit unsafe , consider buying one designed for the purpose .
Here is a wonderful example .
( Opens in new window to Amazon )
And if you ca nât actually hang a cradle , even a rocking cradle standing on the floor , like this beautiful cradle from BabyBjorn , can work perfectly if put close to dad âs bed .
( And remember to let dad handle the rocking â¦ )
But even if you are the only one attending ot your baby at night , this tip can certainly be used to softly help your baby go back to sleep without you even having to get out of bed .
Do nât check what time it is
This may sound like a weird tip , but to me , it is quite important .
Being a new mom with my first child I was ( I think now ) almost obsessed with checking how many hours it was between the nighttime feedings and how long they took .
This meant that every time the feedings were frequent ( and they often were ) or took a long time , I was very aware of how little sleep I was getting .
Sometimes this was so stressful that it was really hard for me to get back to sleep after my baby did .
Less sleep for me !
So do nât focus too much on how much you are awake .
Just do what you have to do as fast and easy as you can and head back to bed .
Go to bed when your child does
To go to sleep with your baby in the evening is nât much fun .
The free time with your spouse ( and yourself ! ) is eliminated .
But if you â are an exhausted new mom â honestly â how much fun are you to be with ?
I know I âm not anyway !
So if you âre really tired , go to bed early at least one night per week or so .
Do this even if you do nât want to or can hand over the first nighttime feeding to dad .
Sleep during the day
To sleep during the day is nât much fun either .
But if you âre at home and tired , sleep for a while when your baby does .
Even 20 minutes will make a difference .
And going to sleep next to your infant can be really cozy !
Well new mom , start implementing these tips NOW .
I know from my own experience that they make a huge difference .
Good luck !

Cycling in Havana : Green Transportation by Default
by Joseph Scarpaci , Associate Professor , Virginia Tech ,
and Annie Z. Hall , Freelance Writer .
Cuba 's political response to a changing world elicits strong emotions from its friends and enemies .
Its streets appear to be trapped in time and its people constrained by forces beyond their control .
At the peak of its alliance with the former USSR and its Eastern European allies , Cuba received nearly $ 5 million in foreign aid daily .
The collapse of the USSR in the late 1980s however , triggered draconian measures that now dominate Cuba 's development and planning agendas .
This austere time , called the " Special Period in a Time of Peace , " challenges the island 's transportation system .
Cuba must triage its use of petroleum -- usually of high sulfur content bought on the spot market -- because domestic supplies satisfy just one percent of its domestic oil needs .
Petroleum requires hard currency which is in scarce supply .
Although it is only too willing to exchange sugar for oil ( it continues to do so with Russia , but at increasingly unfavorable terms for the island ) most petroleum purchases are targeted to public utilities , factories , and fueling tractors for sugar - cane harvests .
Cuba 's transportation system is indicative of the radical turn the country has taken .
Automobile and bus travel receive low priority during these dire times .
If Cuba elicits strong emotions from most readers who hold polarized views of the Revolution , the beauty of Havana is sure to be a point of consensus .
Situated on the Straits of Florida where 16th and 17th century garrisons guard a harbor that was once coveted by corsairs and pirates , the Malecon seaside promenade figures prominently in postcard images of this tropical city .
Havana 's splendid colonial , modern , and Art Deco architectural styles have earned it a variety of names :
The Nice of the Caribbean , " " The Paris of the Antilles , and the " City of Columns , " and Old Havana has been immortalized by Cuban writers such as Alejo Carpentier , Guillermo Cabrera Infante , Reinaldo Arenas , and Jose Lezama Lima .
Havana had a special allure to foreigners who visited the city after the 1959 Revolution , with its old ' 57 Chevys , 49 Buicks , and other classics from an era when Elvis actually wore blue suede shoes .
Today , the four lane Malecon carries more cyclists than automobiles .
Bicycle commuters fret more about strong Northeasterly Trade Winds and the occasional wave that breaks over the sea wall than about bumper to bumper car traffic and air pollution which afflicts most Latin American cities .
The Special Period has cleared Havana 's streets of most of those gas guzzling 8 cylinder ' road hogs ' ; not by choice , mind you , but by the demands of the socialist system for fuel rationing , combined with Cuba 's reinsertion into the global economy .
Just over 2 million residents call Havana home in a country of 11 million .
Like many capital cities , Havana generates a disproportionate amount of the island 's industrial output and holds the lion 's share of the island 's service economy .
Once it was crisscrossed with a streetcar network that greatly expended during the U.S. occupation ( 1898 - 1902 ) following the Spanish - American War .
Preference for the automobile led to the demise of the streetcar in the 1950s , and since then automobile and diesel engine buses came to dominate .
Since the 1960s Eastern European - designed buses have run through Havana 's streets .
By 1990 , however , the number of bus trips and routes began declining .
In 1986 , Havana 's buses accounted for 86 % of total trips by motorized transport , and automobiles - - never a significant mode of transportation , accounted for just 6 % .
Roughly half of the 200 buses in Havana are now out of circulation , and many bus routes have been eliminated , consolidated or cut back , making lengthy waits at crowded bus stops a multi- hour endeavor .
In the wake of this transportation crisis has come a huge increase in bicycles .
In 1990 , Habaneros used their roughly 70,000 bicycles mostly for recreation and sport .
By 1993 , Havana had 700,000 bicycles and 1000 cargo tricycles , mostly purchased from China .
Today , bicycles are used mainly for commuting .
Unlike in China , though , Cuba has not had a bicycle culture .
No road space had been dedicated to non-motorized vehicles before the ' Special Period , ' nor were there traffic signs or data .
With the Special Period , however , all this began to change .
The Chinese models Phoenix , Forever , and Flying Pigeon can now be bought on installment plans for from between $ 60 pesos for students to $ 120 pesos for workers .
In deflated 1995 real dollars , this ranges from $ 1 to $ 2 USD .
Some of the side - effects of the shift to the bicycle include less air pollution in Havana , greater commuting time for workers , and a proliferation of private sector bicycle repair and parking services .
When Fidel Castro legalized more than 100 private sector occupations in July of 1993 , employment in bicycle cottage industries grew rapidly .
Tire repair services , bicycling parking lots , and mechanical repair shops continue to proliferate throughout Havana , and employ many workers idled by public down - sizing and factory closings .
Last year the kind of bicycle taxis common in South Asia surfaced in the Vedado tourist district for foreigners seeking a ride along the Malecon or the tree - covered side streets of Vedado and Miramar .
Tourists can also rent bicycles and jump into the fray themselves .
The big increase in demand for bicycles has had considerable spill - over effects on the Cuban economy .
Although China has been the main supplier of bicycles to Cuba , Cuba is increasingly building more of its own bicycles and components .
In 1990 the Giron bus factory in Havana was refit and retooled for the manufacture of bicycles .
After its first year of operation it produced approximately 20,000 bicycles .
Projected production for 1995 is 100,000 bicycles .
Cubans can now manufacture all components except spokes , bearings , the rear hub and chains , and heavy - gauge seamless pipe , which comes from Mexico .
The Cuban 26 " wheeled bicycle is about 15 pounds lighter than the 57 lb .
Chinese models and better suited for multiple purposes than the 28 " Asian wheel .
Cuban bikes also come in a variety of colors ( now in 12 tropical varieties ) , and most use the all - terrain type straight handlebar .
Habaneros are only slowly adjusting to bicycle transportation .
Until recently , most had not used the bicycle for other than recreational purposes .
Riding in traffic -- usually with hundreds of other cyclists rather than in automobile - clogged streets -- has meant learning a whole new set of skills .
Ignored stop signs , pot hole - ridden streets , tropical downpours , and other obstacles have produced numerous bicycle accidents and even a few casualties .
In 1990 , for instance , about 1/3 of the 306 road fatalities in Havana were non-motorized vehicle - related .
City officials , however , are working towards making Havana a safer city for cyclists .
Today there are at least 26 kms. of non-motorized vehicle - dedicated lanes and cycle paths throughout Havana .
Havana 's beauty is even more striking when seen gliding along on a two - wheeler .
Although the City 's roads were never heavily bogged down with automobile traffic , traveling around the city by bicycle for the foreigner is a beautiful experience .
In the eyes of most Cubans , however , it is a mixed blessing .
Most Cubans begrudgingly accept it as the only way to get around .
On the one hand , the rise in cycling is a rational coping mechanism during the Special Period , is environmentally friendly , and provides excellent exercise .
On the other hand , commuting time has increased as many household heads drop off spouse and children , all packed onto one bike , at their various destinations .
Bicycle theft has also increased , partly because of the new ' liberties ' that Cuba 's free market economy has brought , and partly because locks are scarce .
Finally , Habaneros are exerting more physical energy on their commute at a time of food rationing when belt sizes are being ratcheted down .
There is growing concern about productivity among laborers who on average confront a decreasing caloric intake .
A taxing commute in a torrid climate can weaken some cyclists , especially the elderly .
Some Habaneros who arrive at work hot , tired , and at a job site with few co-workers are unwilling to sacrifice so much for jobs that pay in pesos .
Transportation difficulties and falling worker productivity only irritate the city 's broader economic problems .
The rise of this new , green , and ecologically sound means of transportation , however , brings other rewards .
Havana officials offer a ' ciclo - bus ' , or bicycle bus that carries commuters from the huge post revolutionary suburb of Habana del Este ( Eastern Havana ) and their bikes to and from the central city .
This is a safety measure to carry cyclists who would otherwise have to travel next to cars in a narrow and dimly lit tunnel running under the Bay of Havana .
Flat bed trailers assist the ciclo - bus by shuttling thousands of cyclists through in ' rush ' hours .
Havana 's turn to the two - wheel machine is not a policy of choice , but neither were the 1973 OPEC oil price increases that forced American car manufacturers to produce more economically and environmentally friendly cars .
Will Havana maintain its us of non-motorized transport once economic recovery sets in ?
The 34 - year old U.S. boycott continues to make any imminent economic bonanza highly unlikely , especially considering the increasingly hostile U.S. foreign policy towards Cuba .
Will the bicycle permanently replace the automobile ?
This seems unlikely .
Regardless of how Cuba navigates its present economic storm , it is improbable that either the nation or its capital will revert back to the pre- Special Period levels of subsidized fossil - fuel driven transportation .
Politics and shifts in global political alliances often produce unintended outcomes .
Cycling through the rolling hills of Havana reveals the tenacity of Cubans in the face of extreme adversity .
It also highlights the practical aspects of simple , sustainable transportation .
Bicycle lanes continue to be added , and after six years of bicycle commuting , Habaneros are as likely to welcome lightweight alloy bicycles as cheap gasoline vouchers -- even if they could get spare parts for those old ' 57 Chevys .
This article came originally from the Institute for Transportation & Development Policy RNC Critical Mass Bike Ride
by B. Okie Around 630 pm on Friday , August 27 , bicyclists were gathering in Manhattan at Union Square for the monthly Critical Mass ride .
This ride was of course special because of the Republican National Convention going on during the week of August 30 through September 2 .
The Critical Mass ( CM ) ride was a kickoff for a week of street protests , political gatherings , art and public theater events inspired by a common disgust for the Republican Party National Convention .
Police follow protesters , wearing orange arm bands but not using lights or having bells as required by LAW .
The police were present at Union Square passing out flyers with bike - related laws , trying to intimidate CMers from participating in what has traditionally been a ride that follows its own rules instead of the government's .
The ride was amazing , to have 6,000 cyclists riding as a group through the streets with people cheering on th sidewalks like a parade .
As a cyclist , it feels good to actually feel safe and get respect on the road instead of always being forced to submit to automobile traffic .
We did not see any trouble with the police until the ride went near Times Square , a site temporarily occupied by CM on every ride .
We saw an increased number of cops and police vehicles , and barricades along the sidewalks in the area in and around Times Square .
The police blocked off Seventh Avenue at 34th street , forcing many cyclists to go back or be arrested .
At least three of the arrestees on Seventh Avenue were National Lawyers Guild Legal Observers , whose job it was to gather the names of arrestees and monitor the police .
When the police ordered cyclists to move back , I moved to the side .
Unable to move onto the sidewalk because of the barricades , I was grabbed by a police officer and handcuffed ( much too tightly ) with plastic cuffs .
Several of the Legal Observers who were merely attempting to gather the names of arrestees were also arrested in this hasty mass arrest .
Most of the ride continued west on 35th street , if they had not already broken off into smaller groups earlier on in the ride .
The police again attempted to blockade the ride , this time with orange netting .
Although more riders were arrested , including a couple who walked out of a restaurant with hot take - out food in hand , a couple who had gone grocery shopping and held bags of groceries , and a wall street businessman in suit who had just stepped onto the street to ride to work , most of the Critical Massers escaped .
On 2nd Avenue in the Lower Eat Side , police continued with mass arrests .
Some were arrested at 17th and the bulk of the remaining arrestees at 10th street .
The ride was over and bicyclists were socializing and looking for places to park their bikes .
Some cyclists reported being ordered to disperse in one direction only to be confronted by fierce riot cops ready for a brawl when they did .
Officers in riot gear corralled cyclists , refused to let them disperse , threw them on the ground , on vehicles , and generally roughed them up .
The Criminalization of Bicyclists
At least 260 cyclists were arrested that night in Manhattan .
Clearly , the cops were looking for a reason to arrest any and all that had a bicycle that happened to be near the Critical Mass ride .
Although , the cops have never given NYC Critical Mass trouble in the past , and have even at times provided escorts , on Friday , August 27 , NYPD was inconsistent , misleading , cruel , and unfair .
At times on the ride the cops told cyclists to stop at lights , at other times they stopped side traffic with a green light so that the Critical Mass could pass .
The incidents at 2nd Ave. and 10th street , where cyclists were mass arrested even though the ride was over , clearly shows that NYPD was looking for a reason to mass arrest cyclists .
On Saturday outside Madison Square Garden , Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said " They chose to drive 5,000 bicycles through midtown Manhattan .
Obviously the government had to respond in some fashion . "
When people drive many more than 5,000 cars down Manhattan streets everyday causing wrecks , injuries , and air pollution , thats not a problem ?
Why did n't the " government respond in this manner to any of the previous rides that drew more than a thousand cyclists ?
NYPD had prepared a warehouse / processing station at Pier 57 on the West Side of Manhattan to detain and process up to 1,000 protesters each day of the planned week of NoRNC protests .
the Critical Mass ride was their opportunity to put this warehouse to use and practice for the upcoming days of action .
A big displayed cardboard sign replica behind the processing tables showed arresting officers how to fill out a property clerk 's invoice for a confiscated bicycle , further proving that NYPD planned to mass arrest Critical Massers long before the ride began .
In the days that followed Friday , August 27 , bicyclists were among the most harassed and arrested of all the protesters .
On Sunday , August 29 , the bike bloc in solidarity with the big United For Peace and Justice march was harassed , blockaded , detained and arrested from the moment they left Union Sqare .
That afternoon , cyclists on Broadway were targeted with harassment or arrest for merely passing through the area during the peaceful Mouse Bloc actions intended to send messages to the RNC delegates going to Broadway shows .
It is not just a matter of bicyclists being targeted as protesters .
In a country at war over oil , with a government administration of oil executives , in a city hosting that ruling government 's political convention , cyclists are targeted for political reasons .
Because bicycles as a transportation option present a threat to the oil and car industry in this country , they have already historically not been given fair treatment and infrastructure in city planning .
In NYC during the NoRNC convergence , the targeting of bicyclists for arrest shows that they are seen as a real threat to the powers that be .
For many of the arrestees that night , being arrested was a first .
It was my first time being arrested , and although I did not enjoy the experience , it was a learning experience , something that adds another dimension to my understanding of just how messed up this system is .
For the wall street businessman and all the other privileged people arrested that night , they now have a taste of what it is like to be among those people all too frequently harassed by police and law enforcement for the color of their skin , the neighborhood they live in , or the way they look .
Story of a Critical Mass Arrest
The other cyclists and I grabbed by the police on Seventh Avenue were never told we were under arrest and never read our rights .
When I asked the officer that grabbed me if I was under arrest , he kind of shrugged .
While kept in a little pen on Seventh Avenue , reporters swarmed around us asking questions and shoving cameras in our faces .
" What 's your message ? " " What were you doing ? "
Gradually , buses showed up .
The Arresting officers forced the cyclists and their bikes on the buses .
As I was boarding the bus , several bystanders raised their fists in solidarity .
It gave me some hope .
As the bus I was on headed toward the notorious Pier 57 , it attempted to turn right onto a narrow street lined with cars .
The warning from the police officers on the bus was too late , the bus hit the Cadillac Escalade parked on the corner causing the vehicle to shake and the alarm to go off .
How ironic that the bus full of Critical Mass arrestees hits an SUV on the way to the jail !
Once we arrived at the Pier 57 warehouse , an old bus depot , we were taken off the bus with our bikes by the arresting officers .
We waited in line as each cyclist was photographed 3 times and then a photo was taken of the bike .
We were searched and our belongings were put in a bag .
It felt good to finally get the tight plastic cuffs cut off .
We were placed in chain - link cages with razor - wire , each containing two or three wooden benches and a water dispenser .
The floor of the warehouse was covered in an oily residue that caused skin rashes on some prisoners and filthy stains on everyones clothes that sat or laid down .
Orders form the top , frustration at the bottom
The police officers were visible frustrated and unhappy with the warehouse process .
As I watched the police officers fumble around with the paperwork , bikes , and prisoners , unsure of what to do next , I thought about comments I 've heard people make about activist or anarchist groups being unorganized and laughed to myself at the confusion of the police .
When my name was called to leave the first cage and go through the tables of paperwork and property confiscation , I heard my arresting officer comment to another that " there 's no way this is going to continue like this tomorrow . "
The younger cops and oftentimes the officers of color were frustrated and disgruntled by bureaucratic process and the orders of the commanding officers , who walked around , barked orders , and chuckled to each other .
It feels good to be free ... or sort - of free .
On Saturday , August 28th , I was released from jail on a Desk Appearance ticket , with the promise that I would be back to see a judge in a couple weeks .
It was great to have jail support people waiting outside with legal aid info , food , and support .

If you 've used the internet at all in the last few years , I 'm sure you 've seen your share of CAPTCHAs :
Of course , nobody wants to use CAPTCHAs .
They 're a necessary evil , just like the locks on the doors to your home and your car .
CAPTCHAs are designed to discriminate between computer scripts from spammers and real human beings .
There 's a popular misconception in technical circles that CAPTCHA has been " broken " :
CAPTCHA , which stands for ( C ) ompletely ( A) utomated ( P)ublic ( T ) uring test to tell ( C ) omputers and ( H ) umans ( A ) part , works well for small sites but larger ' community ' sites where there are multiple SPAM targets CAPTCHA only provides a false sense of security - it can be broken fairly easily and serious spammers are getting more sophisticated all the time .
Some people actually believe that spammers can now " fairly easily " write scripts which use advanced optical character recognition to automatically defeat any online CAPTCHA form .
Although there have been a number of CAPTCHA - defeating proof of concepts published , there is no practical evidence that these exploits are actually working in the real world .
And if CAPTCHA is so thoroughly defeated , why is it still in use on virtually every major website on the internet ?
Google , Yahoo , Hotmail , you name it , if the site is even remotely popular , their new account forms are protected by CAPTCHAs .
The comment form of my blog is protected by what I refer to as " naive CAPTCHA " , where the CAPTCHA term is the same every single time .
This has to be the most ineffective CAPTCHA of all time , and yet it stops 99.9 % of comment spam .
I can count on two hands the number of manually entered comment spams I 've gotten since I implemented it .
Granted ,
Yahoo is more popular than my blog by many orders of magnitude .
But it 's still strong evidence that moving the difficulty bar up even one tiny notch can be quite effective in reducing spam .
I went from cleaning up comment spam every day to cleaning one per month .
Big difference .
I 've been experimenting with improving the rendering algorithms in my CAPTCHA server control , and it 's interesting how fragile typical computer OCR really is .
SimpleOCR has an online form that allows you to upload and OCR small greyscale TIF images .
Here are the results of submitting a few standard 180x50 CAPTCHAs from my reworked rendering algorithm .
Note that these CAPTCHAs all use the same font , Courier New .
OCR result Standard CQXKN 5/5 Low perturbation KxT * 2 3/5 Medium perturbation acNx4 2/5 High perturbation Kc 0/5 Extreme perturbation ( blank ) 0/5 Standard , low noise ( blank ) 0/
5
I did n't expect it to do well , but I was frankly surprised how poorly the SimpleOCR engine actually performed .
Adding a tiny bit of noise or perturbation to the CAPTCHA text was all it took to break the OCR .
I 'm sure there are more advanced OCR engines out there that might be able to do somewhat better than the free SimpleOCR engine .
Still , it 's unlikely that any OCR engine could beat high perturbation â where the characters are physically overlapping each other â plus a little background noise .
And that level of CAPTCHA security is absolute overkill unless you happen to run one of the top 100 most popular sites on the internet .
Furthermore , none of these are particularly difficult CAPTCHAs .
The most extreme perturbation sample shown above is eminently " human solvable " , at least in my opinion .
The default settings for my new and improved CAPTCHA server control , a combination of â¦
high contrast for human readability
medium , per-character perturbation
random fonts per character
low background noise
â¦ should be far more protection than most websites need .
Remember , I use " naive CAPTCHA " with 99.9 % effectiveness .
The " low " settings will be even easier to read than the defaults and may be more appropriate for your user base .
Of course , OCR is n't the only way to attack CAPTCHA .
But the other scenarios for spammers " beating " CAPTCHA are even more far - fetched .
The Petmail documentation explains :
1. The Turing Farm
Let 's say spammers set up a sweatshop to employ people to look at computer screens and answer CAPTCHA challenges .
They get to send one message for each challenge passed .
Assuming 10 seconds per challenge , and paying roughly $ 5 per hour , that represents $ 14 per thousand messages .
A typical spam run of 1 million messages per day would cost $ 14,000 per day and require 116 people working 24/ 7 .
This would break the economic model used by most current spammers .
A recent Wired article showed one spammer earning $ 10 for each successful sale .
At that rate , the cost of $ 14,000 for 1,000,000 spam emails requires a 1 in 1000 success rate just to break even , whereas current spammers are managing a 1 in 100,000 or even 1 in 1,000,000 sucess rate .
2. The Turing Porn Farm
A recent slashdot article described a trick in which spammers run a porn site that is gated by CAPTCHA challenges , which are actually ripped directly from Yahoo's new account creation page .
The humans unwittingly solve the challenge on behalf of the spammers , who can therefore automate a process that was meant to be rate - limited to humans .
This attack is simply another way of paying the workers of a Turing Farm .
The economics may be infeasible because porn hosting costs money too .
If you 're not using CAPTCHAs because you think they 're compromised , then you 're too gullible for your own good .
There 's absolutely no concrete data supporting any of these attack scenarios happening outside laboratory ( read : infinite money and time ) conditions .
Just ask Google :
Some captchas have been solved with more than 90 % accuracy by scientists specializing in computer vision research at the University of California , Berkeley , and elsewhere .
Hobbyists also regularly write code to solve captchas on commercial sites with a high degree of accuracy .
But several Internet companies say their captchas appeared to be highly effective at thwarting spammers .
" Researchers are really good , and the attackers really are not , " says Mr. Jeske of Google , based in Mountain View , Calif .
" Having these methods in place we find extremely effective against automated malicious attackers . "
The real secret to CAPTCHA is that it hits spammers where they are most vulnerable : in the pocketbook .
The minute you put up a computational barrier , the entire economic model of spam comes crashing down .
Now if you 'd prefer not to use CAPTCHA because it's an inconvenience for the user , I can respect that .
CAPTCHA is n't the only way to block spammers .
But give CAPTCHA its due : it was one of the original spam blocking measures used way back in 1997 by AltaVista .
And , even more impressively , it 's still one of the most effective ways to block spam at its source today .
Bush Administration push for privatization may have helped create Walter Reed ' disaster ' Ron Brynaert
Published : Saturday March 3 , 2007 Print This Email This The Bush Administration 's drive for privatization may be responsible for the " deplorable " outpatient care for soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , according to a top Democratic Congressman investigating the scandal , which has already led to the resignation of the Secretary of the US Army .
A five - year , $ 120 million contract awarded to a firm run by a former executive from Halliburton Â a multi-national corporation where Vice President Dick Cheney once served as CEO Â will be probed at a Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs hearing scheduled for Monday .
A letter sent by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , to Major General George W. Weightman , the former commander at Walter Reed , asks him to " address the implications of a memorandum from Garrison Commander Peter Garibaldi sent through you to Colonel Daryl Spencer , the Assistant Chief of Staff for Resource Management with the U.S. Army Medical Command " in order to better prepare himself for his testimony at the hearing .
" This memorandum , which we understand was written in September 2006 , describes how the Army 's decision to privatize support services at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was causing an exodus of ' highly skilled and experienced personnel , ' " Waxman 's letter continues .
" As a result , according to the memorandum , ' WRAMC Base Operations and patient care services are at risk of mission failure . ' "
Waxman 's letter states that " several sources have corroborated key portions of the memorandum . "
" We have learned that in January 2006 , Walter Reed awarded a five - year $ 120 million contract to a company called IAP Worldwide Services for base operations support services , including facilities management , " Waxman continues .
" IAP is one of the companies that experienced problems delivering ice during the response to Hurricane Katrina . "
Waxman notes that IAP " is led by Al Neffgen , a former senior Halliburton official who testified before our Committee in July 2004 in defense of Halliburton 's exorbitant charges for fuel delivery and troop support in Iraq . "
Before the contract , over 300 federal employees provided facilities management services at Walter Reed , according to the memorandum , but that number dropped to less than 60 the day before IAP took over .
" Yet instead of hiring additional personnel , IAP apparently replaced the remaining 60 federal employees with only 50 IAP personnel , " Waxman writes .
Waxman adds that " the conditions that have been described are disgraceful , " and that the Oversight Committee will " investigate what led to the breakdown in services . "
" It would be reprehensible if the deplorable conditions were caused or aggravated by an ideological committment to privatized government services regardless of the costs to taxpayers and the consequences for wounded soldier , " Waxman writes , alluding to the Bush Administration 's push for privatization .
A year ago , the Government Accountability Office " dismissed a protest filed on behalf of employees at the Army 's Walter Reed Medical Center , ruling that the employee group had no standing to challenge the outcome of a public - private job competition initiated prior to January 2005 , " GovExec.com reported .
" The American Federation of Government Employees , which provided funding to back the protest , said the impetus to appeal came from Walter Reed managers who were disappointed to see how the competition process played out , " Jenny Mandel reported in February of 2006 .
" While the initial employee bid was $ 7 million less than that of IAP Worldwide Services , a mid-stream solicitation change resulted in a recalculation of the bids by all parties and in IAP 's bid coming in $ 7 million lower , said John Threlkeld , a lobbyist for AFGE . "
The article continues , " Threlkeld said the process for recalculating the employee bid was flawed , resulting in the inflation of the estimate that rendered it uncompetitive with IAP 's bid . "
On Saturday , the Army Times revealed that the Garibaldi memorandum cited by Waxman states that " the push to privatize support services there accelerated under President BushÂs Âcompetitive sourcing Â initiative , which was launched in 2002 . "
Excerpts from Army Times article : #
The letter said the Defense Department Âsystemically Â tried to replace federal workers at Walter Reed with private companies for facilities management , patient care and guard duty Â a process that began in 2000 .
Â But the push to privatize support services there accelerated under President BushÂs Âcompetitive sourcing Â initiative , which was launched in 2002 , Â the letter states .
During the year between awarding the contract to IAP and when the company started , Âskilled government workers apparently began leaving Walter Reed in droves , Â the letter states .
Â The memorandum also indicates that officials at the highest levels of Walter Reed and the U.S. Army Medical Command were informed about the dangers of privatization , but appeared to do little to prevent them . Â
The memo signed by Garibaldi requests more federal employees because the hospital mission had grown Âsignificantly Â during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It states that medical command did not concur with their request for more people .
Â Without favorable consideration of these requests , Â Garibaldi wrote , Â [ Walter Reed Army Medical Center ] Base Operations and patient care services are at risk of mission failure . Â

Meet Marco : he is 13 years old , now is 4 PM , and his best friend has just called him because he has free tickets for the most awaited soccer match of the year .
The match starts at 5 PM .
Unfortunately , Marco has a lot of dishes to clean before his mum allows him to go out .
Anger is mounting by the minute â Mum is Evil ! ! â , then an idea struck him : â I could do the washing up faster , If I use more hot water and I move my hands quickly , I should be able to clean up everything in time for the match .
Let âs get started ! â [ Washing up takes place â¦ ] .
â I made it !
It was not that bad after all ; actually I even enjoyed it a bit â¦ â â¦ and that was my first step in the direction of enjoying the previously boring activity of washing up .
I did nât know it at the time , but I was on my way to experience Dr. Csikszentmihalyiâs Flow You have probably tried a state of total absorption : your sense of self is temporarily suspended , all of the usual worries disappear , and your concentration goes fully to the task at hand .
Is Flow only possible in activities usually regarded as pleasant ?
No , Dr. Csikszentmihalyi has abundantly documented that Flow is reported in a wide variety of situations : you can learn to enjoy an activity which you currently experience as boring .
1- Clarify goals and ways to get feedback .
In order to experience Flow you need to know what your goal is and if you are getting closer to it or not .
In the washing up example , my goal was to finish the activity faster .
It was easy to get feedback , just by looking at the clock I knew if I was performing as I wanted or not .
2- Remove distractionsSometimes to make a boring activity more bearable we add pleasant distractions , for example listening to loud music whilst doing the washing up .
Flow needs concentration , so remove all of the distractions .
3- Select an appropriate level of challenge for you skill .
If I had wanted to complete the washing up in one - third of the usual time , I would have probably experienced stress and failure .
I almost got Flow instead , because the challenge was both realistic and appropriate to my level of skill .
Engagement is found between the boredom of an easy task and the anxiety of an impossible one .

Color us skeptics on this one , but we 've got a tipster claiming to have the scoop on Google Switch .
This version of the mythical Googlephone is said to be the result of a collaboration with Samsung -- not Alpha Networks or HTC .
Of course , it 's a button - less touchscreen device as is the rage these days only this time with GPS built - in for pinpoint navigation around Google Maps .
What 's pictured in that all too familiar blur ( Photoshopped ? ) is the phone 's contact program said to be an extended version of Gtalk combining Gmail , text and instant messaging .
According to our tipster , the device does n't have any on - board storage .
That 's right , all your applications are served up over the network with new apps " attached " to your account via a web interface .
So what is it ... the real deal or engorged fanboy fantasy ?

The Importance Of " Correct Punctuation "
Dear John :
I want a man who knows what love is all about .
You are generous , kind , thoughtful .
People who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior .
You have ruined me for other men .
I yearn for you .
I have no feelings whatsoever when we 're apart .
I can be forever happy -- will you let me be yours ?
Gloria

Much of the concern for global warming has been focused on the Arctic Ocean , where sea ice is disappearing faster than scientists had predicted .
The southern regions of the Earth did nât seem to be as affected .
But new satellite images from NASA âs QuikScat satellite are showing that Antarctica is melting too .
QuikScat measured snowfall accumulation and melting in Antarctica , tracking the period from July 1999 through July 2005 .
Scientists analyzing the results found that several distinct regions across the continent were accelerating their rate of snow melt .
And these regions were places nobody would have anticipated .
There was evidence of melting 900 km ( 560 miles ) inland from the open ocean , only 500 km ( 310 miles ) from the South Pole , and 2,000 metres ( 6,600 feet ) above sea level .
These melting regions do nât actually reach the sea ; however , they refreeze into an extensive ice layer .
The water can penetrate into ice sheets through cracks and glacial shafts , and then lubricate the underside of the ice sheet at the bedrock , causing the ice mass to move more quickly towards the ocean , and raising sea levels .

GEORGE W. BUSHâS presidency is devolving into an extended holding action .
On too many fronts , his top priority now appears to be delaying the inevitable .
Donald H. Rumsfeld , the former Defense secretary , once described the Iraqi resistance as a few â dead- enders â who refused to acknowledge that the world around them had changed .
Increasingly that phrase applies as a self - portrait for the administration that Rumsfeld served .
Forget â the decider . â
Bush has become the dead - ender .
Example A is the debate over embryonic stem cell research , in which Bush has grown increasingly isolated in his determination to block broad federal funding .
Religious conservatives back his stance .
But when the Senate this month approved legislation to loosen the funding restraints that Bush set in 2001 , the bill drew support from 525 medical , business , academic and civic organizations .
Fully 63 senators voted for the bill -- all but two Democrats in attendance and 17 Republicans , including conservatives such as Trent Lott and Orrin Hatch .
Among the top Republican presidential contenders , only Mitt Romney stands with Bush ; John McCain voted for the bill , and Rudy Giuliani indicated support .
( Full disclosure : My wife works in McCain âs Senate office . )
Every major Democratic presidential candidate also supports broader funding .
Bush may hold the line with a veto , but the odds are overwhelming that the next president will reverse his direction .

The same is true on global warming .
Bush has nât completely ignored the problem .
He âs increased federal research on such green technologies as clean coal and advanced biofuels .
But he opposes the critical step that could move such ideas from the lab to the marketplace : mandatory requirements for industry to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming .
BUSH âS POSITION leaves him , like the polar bears threatened by receding Arctic ice , clinging to shrinking ground .
In a recent Gallup Poll , four - fifths of adults supported mandatory greenhouse gas reductions .
Even two - thirds of Republicans agreed .
Just as dramatic is the realignment in the boardroom .
In January , leading companies , such as General Electric and Alcoa , joined with environmentalists to form the United States Climate Action Partnership , which is promoting mandatory greenhouse gas reductions .
These businesses have recognized that such mandates â incentivize â green innovation ; without them , companies that make the investments to reduce emissions can face a competitive disadvantage .
ConocoPhillips recently became the first major U.S. oil company to sign on to the partnership .
Even the auto and utility industries , two of the biggest emission sources , are warming to mandatory carbon limits .
Jeff Sterba , the incoming chairman of the Edison Electric Institute , the trade association of investor - owned utilities , says he supports â moving our country forward as quickly as possible â to compulsory carbon reductions .

On global warming , in other words , there are oil , auto and utility executives showing more urgency than Bush .
That âs like prisoners worrying that the warden is skimping on security .
The leading Democratic candidates all support mandatory greenhouse gas reductions .
Some potential Republican nominees ( particularly Romney ) might join Bush in resisting these mandates .
But given the coalition assembling behind them -- and the recent Supreme Court decision virtually requiring the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases -- the real question is not whether , but how quickly , the next president will act .
On Iraq , the path ahead is murkier , but a turn away from Bush âs open - ended commitment also appears inevitable .
For now , solid congressional Republican support is allowing Bush to resist Democratic proposals to unwind American involvement .
But two trends are eroding Bush âs stone wall .
One is the war âs strain on the military .
The Defense Department âs announcement that it is extending tours for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from 12 to 15 months -- the longest stints since World War II -- underscored the practical difficulty of sustaining such a large troop commitment .

The second is persistent public discontent over the war .
In surveys , about 60 % of Americans call the war a mistake .
If the public remains disillusioned as 2008 nears -- a good bet -- the demand will grow even among Republican candidates for a plan to responsibly lead the U.S. out of Iraq .
Bush could begin building a consensus that emphasizes regional diplomacy and sharper pressure on Iraqis to reform and reconcile , and that ties a fair test of his surge with a commitment to begin withdrawing if it does nât yield more progress than it has so far .
But Bush appears determined to leave the hard job of forging a new direction to his successor .
Bush is nât looking backward on all tests .
He âs trolling for deals with Democrats on two big 21st century challenges -- immigration and controlling entitlement costs -- though the overall tension between the White House and Congress makes achieving agreement on those issues difficult .
But on stem cells , global warming and Iraq , Bush seems intent on defending the decisions he âs made already , even at the price of obstructing a new consensus attempting to form around him .
If Bush continues to view standing alone as the highest form of principle , he will never escape the dead end into which he âs steered his second term .

Close all applications , then open Minesweeper , type xyzzy , then hold down the Shift key for a second .
Now when you move your mouse over the cells , you will see either a white or black pixel in the top left of your desktop ... white means no mine , black means mine ( you might adjust your wallpaper to see this ) .
Works like a charm ... [ Via XP Secrets . ]
You can also play Minesweeper online ...
Blish is a marketplace where you can buy and sell all kinds of stuff ... but it âs only digital stuff ( like audio files , or videos ) .
Interesting concept with a clean layout .
Gary points out the Google Personalized Homepage is now also available for certain mobile phones .
Just point your phone to â www.google.com/ig/mobileâ.
It crashed my mobile Opera and did nât work on my Nokia default browser either , but you might want to give it a try with your phone ...

Starting today , Google 's homepage is running an ad for Firefox with Google Toolbar that is only displayed to Internet Explorer users ( currently only in the US ) .
And the folks at
SpreadFireFox
have
a screenshot
The web developer in me is Very Happy about this news .
IE7 is supposedly " of what this 'll look like ( edit : The Screenshot is n't available on SpreadFireFox anymore , but you can look at it right here ) .
The add will only be shown to IE users ( so those of you who 're cool enough to be using a modern browser wo n't see it ) , and only in the US ... for now .
The web developer in me is Very Happy about this news .
IE7 is supposedly "
layout - complete
" in the latest beta .
This means that although the application is n't yet " feature - complete , " development on the rendering engine is frozen and locked down for this particular version of the software .
While the new rendering engine is a BIG improvement over the stagnated IE6 muckery , there 're still several CSS rendering issues do n't look like they 'll be addressed .
So the more people who switch to a
Gecko
- based app , the better .
Plus , the little orange fox is so much cooler than the Big Blue E .
The Mathematics Behind Quantum Computing : Part I Posted May 2007 .
This column and next month 's will present a description of Shor 's Factorization Algorithm in terms appropriate for a general mathematical audience ...

Mail to a friend Print this article Quantum computing Quantum computing may be just around the corner or it may be , for all practical purposes , permanently out of reach :
The physics needed for a useful quantum computer has not yet been discovered , and may in fact not exist .
A quantum computer , real or potential , is essentially different from an adding machine .
Whereas the dials in Pascal 's A.D. 1645 brass calculator always line up to read out exactly one 6 - digit number , the set of qubits in a quantum register exist in a superposition of states :
When the register is interrogated one of these states is read out , with a definite probability , and the remaining information is lost .
Because the register can simultaneously be " in " a huge number of states , a huge number of calculations may be carried out simultaneously .
But the inputs to a quantum computer must be organized to take advantage of superposition , and the calculating process must force the probabilistic output to give useful information .
This is the problem of programming a quantum computer , and in certain important and interesting cases it has been solved .
One of the quantum computing algorithms , a factorization algorithm due to Peter Shor , will be the focus of these two columns .
The factorization problem Communication security today is almost universally ensured by the use of RSA encryption .
This method relies on the inaccessibility of large prime factors of a large composite number .
The problem is an artificial one :
The encrypter takes two ( or more ) large primes and multiplies them .
The decrypter tries to work backwards from the product to the factors .
It is hard work .
The largest number factored so far ( " RSA - 640 " ) had 193 decimal digits and took " approximately 30 2.2GHz - Opteron - CPU years , " over five months of calendar time .
At that rate a 1024 - bit number , the size currently recommended by a commercial cryptology site , would take on the order of 10145 years ( " bit " is short for " binary digit ; " each additional bit contributes a factor of 2 to the size of the calculation ) .
The site adds : " For more security or if you are paranoid , use 2048 or even 4096 bits . "
A quantum computer of suitable size could factor these large numbers in a much shorter time .
For a 1024 - bit number , Shor 's Algorithm requires on the order of 10243 , about one billion , operations .
I do not have any information on how quickly quantum operations can be executed , but if each one took one second our factorization would last 34 years .
If a quantum computer could run at the speed of today 's electronic computers ( 100 million instructions per second and up ) then factorization of the 1024 - bit number would be a matter of seconds .
A note on " suitable size . "
To run Shor 's Algorithm on a 1024 - bit number requires two quantum registers , one of 2048 qubits and one of 1024 .
These qubits all have to be " in coherence , " so that the totality of their states behaves as a single , entangled state .
( More about entanglement later ) .
It was reported as an extraordinary technical feat when IBM scientists in 2001 constructed a coherent quantum register with 7 qubits and used it with Shor 's Algorithm to factor 15 .
This column and next month 's will present a description of Shor 's Factorization Algorithm in terms appropriate for a general mathematical audience .
This month will cover the number - theoretical underpinning along with the Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms .
These convert factorization into a frequency - detection problem which is structured so that it can be adapted for quantum computation .
The problem itself has a definite answer but takes exponential time to get there .
Next month 's column will address the more specifically quantum - computational aspects of the algorithm , including superposition and entanglement , leading up to Shor 's ingenious quantum jiu - jitsu , which forces the quantum read - out , with high probability , to give a useful answer .
That probability is high enough , and the running time on a suitable machine would be short enough , for the calculation to be repeated until the unknown factors are produced .
Number Theory and Fourier Analysis { C}
The light from a star can be split into a spectrum , where the characteristic frequencies of its elements can be detected .
Analogously , a composite number N can be made to generate a spectrum , from which its factors can be calculated .
Choose a number a relatively prime to N , and make the list of integer powers of a modulo N : a , a2 , a3 , ... .
If a and N are relatively prime , it follows from a theorem of Euler that this list will eventually include the number 1 . ( Euler 's Theorem says specifically that if Ï ( N ) denotes the number of positive integers less that N which are coprime to N then aÏ ( N ) is congruent to 1 modulo N ) .
Suppose this happens for an even power of a , say a 2 b = 1 mod N , i.e. a 2 b â 1 = 0 mod N.
This means that ( ab + 1 ) ( ab â 1 ) is a multiple of N ; if it is one times N we have our factors ; otherwise the Euclidean Algorithm will speedily find a common factor of , say , ab + 1 and N .
These examples are trivially simple , but illustrate the phenomenon : Take N = 85 and a = 19 .
The powers of 19 mod 85 are 19 , 21 , 59 , 16 , 49 , 81 , 9 , 1 , 19 , 21 , ... ; in particular 19 8 = 1 mod 85 .
We deduce that 19 4 + 1 = 17 and 19 4 â 1 = 15 both have common factors with 85 .
In fact the first is a factor and the second has 5 as common divisor with 85 .
= 1 mod 85 .
We deduce that 19 + 1 = 17 and 19 â 1 = 15 both have common factors with 85 .
In fact the first is a factor and the second has 5 as common divisor with 85 .
Take N = 85 and a = 33 .
The powers of 33 mod 85 are 33 , 69 , 67 , 1 , 33 , 69 , 67 , 1 , ... ; in particular 33 4 = 1 mod 85 .
We deduce that 33 2 + 1 = 70 and 33 2 â 1 = 68 both have common factors with 85 .
In fact the first yields 5 and the second 17 .
= 1 mod 85 .
We deduce that 33 + 1 = 70 and 33 â 1 = 68 both have common factors with 85 .
In fact the first yields 5 and the second 17 .
Note that Ï ( 85 ) = 64 , so 64 would always work ; but this number cannot be calculated a priori : you have to know the prime factorization 85 = 17 x 5 , and use the rule Ï ( pq ) = ( pâ1 ) ( qâ1 ) for p and q prime .
How do we get our hands on b ?
Just examining the terms of the sequence and waiting for 1 to show up takes too long , because the length of the list is commensurate with the number N we want to factor :
It increases exponentially with the number , say n , of bits used to write N. But think of the stream of numbers a mod N , a2 mod N , a3 mod N , ... as the light emitted by N .
If we can find the frequency , or equivalently the period , with which this sequence repeats itself , we can use the equivalence aj = ak < = > ajâk = 1 ( modulo N ) , and find a factorization of N as above .
We will see that on a quantum computer , this computation requires a number of steps increasing only as a polynomial in n .
That is the key to quantum factorization .
Discrete Fourier Transforms
Fourier transforms detect periodicity ; we will find b using a quantum adaptation of the Fast Fourier Transform , a speeded - up version of the Discrete Fourier Transform , which itself arises from adapting to sequences the Fourier Series designed to work with continuous functions .
The ( complex ) Fourier coefficients of a real - valued function f( x ) defined on [ 0,2A ] are .
Notes : Writing e i nÏx / A as cos nÏx / A + i sin nÏx / A and c n = a n + i b n gives the usual sine and cosine coefficients , except that c 0 is twice the usual a 0 .
as cos nÏx / A + i sin nÏx / A and c = a + i b gives the usual sine and cosine coefficients , except that c is twice the usual a .
The factor 1 / allows the identity , which will be important in our later quantum computations .
Suppose now we think of a sequence f = f 0 , f 1 , ... , f 2Aâ1 ( A now an integer ) , as the set of values at x = 0 , x = 1 , x = 2 , ... , x = 2A â1 of a function f( x ) defined on the interval [ 0,2A ] , and that we define a new c n by replacing the Fourier integral with a left - hand sum with 2A equal subdivisions of length 1 .
This sum only involves the elements of f : .
Notes : e i ( 2A +k ) mÏ/ A = e i 2 m Ï e i kmÏ / A = e i kmÏ/ A , so coefficients indexed 2A and higher give no extra information .
= e e = e , so coefficients indexed 2A and higher give no extra information .
The sequence c of coefficients c 0 , ... , c 2Aâ1 is the Discrete Fourier Transform of the sequence f .
of coefficients c , ... , c is the Discrete Fourier Transform of the sequence .
Essentially the same calculation retrieves f from c : ( note the minus sign in the exponents ) .
Transform of a periodic sequence Suppose that f has period p , i.e. f m+p = f m for every value of m ; the simplest case to analyze is when p is a divisor of 2A , say p = 2A / k , k an integer .
In that case , if n is not a multiple of k ( green boxes in the examples below ) the periodic reappearances of a sequence item f m are multiplied by coefficients which cycle through a complete set of roots of 1 , and thereby add up to zero .
The explicit formula is :
So the only chance for a non-zero Fourier coefficient is when n is a multiple of k , ( and then , up to a factor , c 0 , c k , c 2 k , ... , c ( pâ1 ) k are the 0th , 1st , 2nd , ... , ( pâ1 ) - st Fourier coefficients of the sequence f restricted to a single period ) .
Fig. 1 . Discrete Fourier Transform analysis of the sequence given by the first 16 powers of 19 ( modulo 85 ) , a sequence with period 8 and frequency 16/8 = 2 .
When n is a multiple of 2 ( e.g. orange boxes ) every re-occurrence of a sequence item gets the same coefficient , and c n has a chance of being nonzero .
Otherwise ( e.g. green boxes ) it is zero .
The complex numbers in the matrix are graphically represented as unit vectors .
Each c n is the weighted vector sum of the entries in the column above it , weights coming from the f k column on the right , with an overall factor of 1 / = 1/4 .
The c n have been uniformly scaled to fit in the picture .
Fig. 2 . Discrete Fourier Transform analysis of the sequence given by the first 16 powers of 33 ( modulo 85 ) .
This sequence has period 4 and frequency 16/4=4 .
The non -zero c n only occur for n a multiple of 4 .
Graphic conventions are the same as in Fig. 1 . Why powers of 2 ?
I have chosen for illustration a number ( 85 ) which generates power residue sequences with periods which are powers of 2 , and I have chosen to analyze a length ( 16 ) of sequence which is also a power of 2 .
The second choice is not immaterial : The Fast Fourier Transform we will use , and its quantum adaptation , both require it .
The first choice is only for covenience in generating a small example .
Shor shows that to get a reliable read on the power residue period in general , in the problem of factoring N , one must analyze sequences of a length 2n between N2 and 2N2 .
So to analyze a number like 85 realistically , we would have to work with sequences of length 8192 .
The Fast Fourier Transform
The Fast Fourier Transform which adapts directly to quantum computation is the Radix - 2 Cooley - Tukey algorithm , invented in 1965 ( reinvented , actually , since it later turned out to have been known to Gauss ) .
To control the width of this presentation , I am going to work with the order - 8 Discrete Fourier Transform , rather than order - 16 as above .
Taking Ï = eiÏ /4= 2 â1/2(1 + i ) as our primitive 8th root of 1 , the 0 - 7th powers of Ï are 1 , eiÏ / 4 , eiÏ / 2 , e3iÏ / 4 , eiÏ , e5 iÏ / 4 , e3iÏ / 2 , e7iÏ / 4 , or 1 , Ï , i , iÏ , â 1 , âÏ , âi , âiÏ , the numbers represented graphically above as , , , , , , , .
The transform c of an arbitrary length - 8 sequence f = f 0 , f 1 , ... , f 7 , given by , would be produced from the array 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 f 0 1 Ï i iÏ â 1 âÏ âi âiÏ f 1 1 i â 1 âi 1 i â 1 âi f 2 1 iÏ âi Ï â 1 â iÏ i âÏ f 3 1 â 1 1 â 1 1 â 1 1 â 1 f 4 1 âÏ i âiÏ â 1 Ï âi iÏ f 5 1 âi â 1 i 1 âi 1 i f 6 1 â iÏ âi âÏ â 1 iÏ i Ï f 7 c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 by setting the last row to be f 0 times the first plus ... plus f 7 times the eighth , the whole sum divided by .
This calculation would require eight multiplications and seven additions for each item in c , or 120 operations in all .
Working with a sequence of length 2n , the number of operations would be 2n ( 2n+1 â 1 ) .
Our Fast Fourier Transform leads in n steps from the elements f 0 , ... f 2nâ1 of the input sequence to the coefficients c 0 , ... c 2nâ1 of its Discrete Fourier Transform .
We illustrate the process here for n = 3 .
Each column represents a successive step of the calculation .

In this presentation of the algorithm the elements of the sequence f are ordered backwards and the elements of the transformed sequence c appear in " bit reversed " order : c n appears on line k where ( in binary ) k is n written backwards ; e.g. c 6 ( 110 ) appears on line 3 ( 011 ) .
Working with a sequence of length 2n the computation table has 2n rows ; in each row are n columns requiring computation ; each entry is calculated as a linear combination of two entries from the previous column , and so requires two multiplications and a sum ; altogether 3n operations per row for a total of 3n2n operations .
Contrasting this with the 2n ( 2n+1 â 1 ) operations to implement the Discrete Fourier Transform shows that the Fast Fourier Transform is fast indeed .
Why does this work ?
The most transparent explanation I know uses properties of polynomial long division .
Here I will specalize to the example at hand .
we can understand Step 1 as transforming the degree - 7 polynomial f into two degree - 3 polynomials ( red boxes ) each of which can produce , via its remainders , half of the c n .
Then Step 2 transforms each of the degree - 3 polynomials into two degree - 1 polynomials ( green boxes ) , each of which can produce a quarter of the c n , and Step 3 transforms each of the degree - 1 polynomials into two degree - 0 polynomials , which are their own remainders .
For a sequence f of length 8 , the expression for the nth Fourier coefficient can be read as the value at einÏ / 4 of the polynomial f( x ) = f 0 + f 1 x + ... + f 7 x7 : .
If a polynomial p(x ) is divided by the monic , first degree polynomial xâa , the remainder is exactly the number p(a ) .
So c n is ( 1/ ) times the remainder when f(x ) is divided by ( xâ ein Ï / 4 ) .
The shift in focus from evaluation of a polynomial to calculation of remainders is the key to the economies of the Fast Fourier Transform .
The remainder when f(x ) is divided by x4 â 1 is ( f 3 + f 7 ) x3 + ( f 2 + f 6 ) x2 + ( f 1 + f 5 ) x + ( f 0 + f 4 ) , and its remainder upon division by x4 + 1 is ( f 3 â f 7 ) x3 + ( f 2 â f 6 ) x2 + ( f 1 â f 5 ) x + ( f 0 â f 4 ) .
And in general , if a 2 nâ1 x2n â1 + ... + a 0 is divided by xn â c , the remainder is a nâ1 xnâ1 + ... + a 0 + c ( a 2nâ1 xnâ1 + ... + a n ) [ Note : last term corrected ( from a 2n ) 6/2/14 ] .
This is what makes calculation of remainders especially simple when the overall degree is a power of 2 .
Since x4 â 1 = ( x2 â 1 ) ( x2 + 1 ) = ( x â 1 ) ( x + 1 ) ( x â i ) ( x + i ) , it follows that f( x ) and p(x ) = ( f 3 + f 7 ) x3 + ( f 2 + f 6 ) x2 + ( f 1 + f 5 ) x + ( f 0 + f 4 ) have the same remainder when divided by any one of the factors ( x â 1 ) , ( x + 1 ) , ( x â i ) or ( x + i ) .
Because if f( x ) = ( x4 â 1 ) q( x ) + p( x ) and for example p( x ) = ( x â i ) q ' ( x ) + a , then f( x ) = [ ( x â 1 ) ( x + 1 ) ( x â i ) ( x + i ) ] q( x ) + ( x â i ) q ' ( x ) + a also has remainder a when divided by ( x â i ) .
Similarly , since x4 + 1 = ( x2 â i ) ( x2 + i ) = ( x â Ï ) ( x + Ï ) ( x â iÏ ) ( x + iÏ ) , the degree - 3 polynomial ( f 3 â f 7 ) x3 + ( f 2 â f 6 ) x2 + ( f 1 â f 5 ) x + ( f 0 â f 4 ) can be used , via its remainders , to calculate f( Ï ) , etc. Returning to the Fast Fourier Transform calculation

The people who agreed to describe the closed meeting of vice presidents last week would do so only when promised anonymity .
The descriptions were provided both by critics and defenders of Mr. Wolfowitz , who said they wanted to ensure that the public got an accurate account of the proceedings .
Those who attended the meeting said that Mr. Wheeler , the managing director , did not raise the issue of the anticorruption agenda , but that the residue of the battles on that issue continued to be felt .
Mr. Wheeler said that if Mr. Wolfowitz did not resign , bank staff and colleagues would direct their ire at the board of directors and also the finance ministries around the world for not taking action against him .
The board is studying whether Mr. Wolfowitz violated bank rules in arranging a pay - and - promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza , his companion , and whether she violated bank rules in traveling to Iraq in 2003 as a temporary employee of a defense contractor .
Mr. Bennett , the lawyer , is seeking to make the case that Mr. Wolfowitz âs role in arranging the package when Ms. Riza was detailed to the State Department in 2005 was not a â hanging offense . â
But he has apparently failed in his effort to persuade the bank board to give Mr. Wolfowitz more time to make his case on the matter of Ms. Riza .
â I have heard that the board is not inclined to meet with me , â Mr. Bennett said in an interview .
â I âm very concerned about that because I think there âs a lot of bad information out there , and I want to make sure the board has all the information , some of which I believe is exculpatory . â
A new indication of how deep the divisions are over Mr. Wolfowitz surfaced Tuesday .
The bank board met to give support to a broad strategy on maternal health policies and got into a wrangle with the American director , Eli Whitney Debevoise II , over language referring to comprehensive reproductive â services , â which some equate with abortion .
Bank officials said that word of the dispute touched off a new round of e-mail messages and telephone calls at the bank , with most officials charging that the United States was trying to impose a conservative agenda on bank policies .
Mr. Wolfowitz , seeking to allay suspicions on this issue , has told many bank officials that he favors all aspects of the bank âs family planning approaches .
Quantum Physics Summary
Note :
This is an earlier quantum theory summary .
I thought it was still useful ( and short ! ) so I left it here .
From 1900 to 1930 there was a revolution in the foundations of our understanding of light and matter interactions .
In 1900 Max Planck showed that light energy must be emitted and absorbed in discrete ' quanta ' to explain blackbody radiation .
Then in 1905 Albert Einstein showed that the energy E of light is determined by its frequency f , where E=hf .
Finally , in the mid 1920s , Louis de Broglie and Erwin Schrodinger introduced the concept of Standing Waves to explain these discrete frequency and energy states of light and matter ( standing waves only exist at discrete frequencies and thus energy states ) .
So it is clear that Waves are central to Quantum Physics and our understanding of the structure and discrete energy states of both Light and Matter ( which explains why Quantum Theory is also called Quantum Wave Mechanics ) .
This is only a very simplistic summary ( the probability / non-locality problems have not been addressed ) , but it is enough to start with , the quantum theory pages ( on either side ) provide more detailed explanations of these ' strange ' aspects of Quantum Physics .
What I find strange though , is that while the discrete energy states of light and matter were calculated using standing wave equations , only recently ( Wolff 1986 , Haselhurst 1997 ) has there been any effort to consider a pure Wave Structure of Matter .
i.e.
To discard the discrete ' particle ' concept and explain the ' particle ' properties of light and matter in terms of spherical standing waves and their interactions ( which only occur at discrete frequencies f which then explain the discrete energy quanta E where E=hf ) .
When we do this we find very obvious and simple solutions to many of these Quantum Physics problems .
Basically it seems that this ' strangeness ' of quantum theory has been caused by the continuing assumption of the discrete ' particle ' concept for both light and matter , and thus the resulting paradox of the ' Particle / Wave ' duality .
This has contributed to our current postmodern world view that it is impossible for us to ever correctly understand and describe physical reality ( Bohr , Heisenberg ) .
Thus a solution to these problems , founded on this new paradigm of the Metaphysics of Space ( existing as a continuous Wave Medium ) and the Wave Structure of Matter is clearly a significant discovery .
More so when you realise that this new way of looking at things also explains and solves a lot of the problems of Albert Einstein 's Theory of Relativity and Cosmology .
Help Humanity
" You must be the change you wish to see in the world . "
( Mohandas Gandhi )
" When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence : Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter .
...
Physical objects are not in space , but these objects are spatially extended .
In this way the concept ' empty space ' loses its meaning .
...
The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high .
...
The free , unhampered exchange of ideas and scientific conclusions is necessary for the sound development of science , as it is in all spheres of cultural life .
...
We must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing situation is possible without a severe struggle ; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm and the misguided .
...
Humanity is going to need a substantially new way of thinking if it is to survive ! " ( Albert Einstein )
Our world is in great trouble due to human behaviour founded on myths and customs that are causing the destruction of Nature and climate change .
We can now deduce the most simple science theory of reality - the wave structure of matter in space .
By understanding how we and everything around us are interconnected in Space we can then deduce solutions to the fundamental problems of human knowledge in physics , philosophy , metaphysics , theology , education , health , evolution and ecology , politics and society .
This is the profound new way of thinking that Einstein realised , that we exist as spatially extended structures of the universe - the discrete and separate body an illusion .
This simply confirms the intuitions of the ancient philosophers and mystics .
Given the current censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals ( based on the standard model of particle physics / big bang cosmology ) the internet is the best hope for getting new knowledge known to the world .
But that depends on you , the people who care about science and society , realise the importance of truth and reality .

Screensaver of floating money used in some of the experiments .
Just the mere thought of money can turn a person selfish , so that he helps others less often and prefers to play alone , a new study shows .
In a series of nine experiments , researchers found that money enhanced people 's motivation to achieve their own goals and degraded their behavior toward others .
The concept of money , they suggest , makes a person feel more self - sufficient and thus more apt to stand alone .
The scientists said the study had nothing to do with making a person feel wealthy .
When real or fake money , or even a photo of cash , was placed in sight of participants , they became selfish .
The results could explain why the topic of money can be so detrimental to a couple 's lasting bond .
" In our experiments , the people who are reminded of money really worked hard toward their own goals .
But that might not be conducive to a good interpersonal relationship , " said study leader Kathleen Vohs of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota .
Staged scenes
The scientists split 50 undergraduate students into two groups .
One was primed with the concept of money ; other served as a control and was not primed .
A few methods were used to get the participants thinking about money :
In some experiments , a stack of play Monopoly money was within a subject 's peripheral view , or a subject would unscramble word phrases dealing with money , while in others a participant would sit in front of a computer screensaver showing pictures of floating money [ image ] .
The subjects were unaware the money was even a part of the experiments as they filled out unrelated questionnaires .
Then scientists gave the subjects a challenging problem to solve with the experimenter letting them know he was available for help if needed .
Sure enough , the money subjects persisted much longer before asking for help .
In one test , a participant sat in a lab filling out a questionnaire when a supposed student walked into the room and said , " Can you come over here and help me ? "
She explained that she was an undergraduate student and needed help coding data sheets , each of which would take five minutes .
Some of the participants did n't help at all , Vohs said .
The control group volunteered an average of 42.5 minutes of their time , whereas the money group gave about 25 minutes .
Another experiment gave participants the opportunity to lend a helping hand in a situation requiring no skills .
In a staged accident , a random person walked through a room where a participant sat filling out a questionnaire , and spilled a bunch of pencils .
The money participants picked up far fewer pencils than the controls .
Stand alone
To understand how money affects interpersonal relationships , the scientists told each participant they would have a conversation to acquaint themselves with another participant .
While the experimenter went to retrieve the other subject , the participant was to set up two chairs for the engagement .
The subjects in the money group put more physical distance between themselves and new acquaintances compared with control subjects .
When choosing between two activities -- such as an in - home catered dinner versus four personal cooking lessons -- the money - primed subjects chose individually focused activities more often .
And when given the option of working with another participant or working alone on an advertising project , fewer money subjects chose teamwork .
The results , detailed in Nov. 17 issue of the journal Science , showed no differences in terms of socioeconomic status or gender .
Money message
A take - home message , Vohs explained , is that " cooperation really goes down the drain when money is an issue . "
For business managers , this could translate into keeping the idea of money in the background .
" In a lot of businesses , we train our MBA 's to work in teams , " Vohs said .
" If the team has a sales goal , then to the extent that money is really a big topic to that team , you 're likely to see that cooperation is going to be reduced . "
And for couples who want to work as a team , she said , taking money out of the equation can only help .

I use pretty often emacs - w3 m to read technical HTML docs within Emacs .
When you âre programming , reading manuals , blogs or tutorials without leaving your operating system editor is all but convenient .
Actually , emacs - w3 m does a very , very good job rendering even moderately complex sites , and iâve been known to use it as my default browser .
It is not limited to plain text ( Emacs groks images these days ) , has tabs ( shameless plug : take a look at my w3m- session package to add session management ) and renders tables and other HTML constructs nicely .
And of course , navigating sites like the Emacs wiki without leaving Emacs is just the way to go .
Besides , if you do nât like how a page looks in emacs - w3 m , opening it in your graphical browser is just a keystroke away ( C- h w w3 m - view - url - with - external - browser to discover it ) .
I also have usually open a tab with my Gmail account , to quickly check my email every now and then .
As you can see in the screenshot on the right , emacs - w3 m renders Gmail pages very decently ( hint : you âll need to activate cookies to use Gmail , by setting the variable w3 m - use - cookies to a non-nil value ) .
But of course the Gmail page i visit more frequently is the Spam tab , and the operation i want to perform more frequently in there is to mark all the mails and press â Delete Forever â .
But alas , w3 m does not support javascript , and the handy â Select All â link is missing .
Obviously , tabbing your way to every single spam mail to select it would be a pain , and one is tempted to follow the advice at the top of the page about a better Gmail experience .
But wait , this is not your regular browser .
We âre inside Emacs , and in here , when we need something , we usually just hack it and keep on working .
After all , what we need to do is quite simple : look for occurrences of â[ ] â in the buffer , click them , and leave the pointer over the â Delete forever â button , ready to send all our spam where it deserves .
As it happens , our life is even easier thanks to the functions provided by emacs - w3 m. w3 m - form - goto - next - field allows easy navigation inside a form , and w3m - view - this - url will perform a click for us .
So here we go : let âs write an Elisp command that looks for unmarked checkboxes and clicks them :
( defun jao - w3 m - gmail - mark - all ( ) ( interactive ) ( beginning - of - buffer ) ( when ( search - forward " [ ] " nil t ) ( backward - char 4 ) ( w3 m - form - goto - next - field ) ( while ( looking - at " \\\\ ] " ) ( w3m- view - this-url ) ( w3m-form - goto - next - field ) ) ) )
That âs it .
After evaluating this definition , we just M-x jao - w3 m - gmail - mark - all to mark all our mails .
Of course , a keyboard shortcut will come in handy :
( define - key w3 m - mode - map ( kbd " C-ck " ) ' jao-w3m-gmail - mark - all )
and now we only need to press C - ck to get the job done .
While we âre at it , it would be nice if typing a prefix would unmark mails instead of marking it , would nât it ?
Well , that only needs a few tweaks in our original definition :
( defun jao - w3 m - gmail - mark - all ( unmark ) ( interactive " P " ) ( beginning - of - buffer ) ( when ( search - forward ( if unmark " [ * ] " " [ ] " ) nil t ) ( backward - char 4 ) ( w3 m - form - goto - next - field ) ( while ( looking - at ( if unmark " \\\\*\\\\ ] " " \\\\ ] " ) ) ( w3m- view - this-url ) ( w3m-form - goto - next - field ) ) ) )
Now , C - ck will mark , and C - uC - ck will unmark .
As you can see , the limit is just your imagination .
For instance , when iâm reading non-spam , i usually mark some mails for deletion .
Then i need to go to the â More actions â¦ â menu , select the â Delete â operation and press â Go â .
Hmm , a bit of a chore .
Elisp to the rescue :
( defun jao - w3 m - gmail - delete ( ) ( interactive ) ( beginning - of - buffer ) ( when ( search - forward " [ More Actions " nil t) ( w3 m - view - this -url ) ( search - forward " Trash " ) ( beginning - of - line ) ( w3m-form- input-select-set ) ( w3m-form - goto - next - field ) ) )
Admittedly , these little extensions are far from earth - shattering , but i think that they illustrate quite well what having an extensible system means .
You control your environment and adapt it to your particular needs , often building upon functionality provided either by the system or by some other extension library .
Another nice example of extensibility at work is my w3m - session package : i wanted persistent sessions , so i wrote an extension .
And it was easy , thanks to the nice work of the emacs - w3 m hackers and , let âs not forget , the dynamic nature of Elisp .
In addition , the programmer in me finds tweaks like this a continuous source of fun .
You know , that fuzzy warm feeling â¦ but i digress .
Happy hacking !
If one is to endure a prime ministerial discourse on Iraq for any length of time these days , it is necessary - in the name of sanity - to cultivate strategies of detachment .
Destroying another radio solves nothing , and there may be health risks associated with beginning one 's waking day shouting dementedly at the glottal - stopped voice drifting over the airwaves .
And so it was , listening to Tony Blair sing the praises of his Iraq adventure on the Today programme on Thursday , that my mind began to wander .
If it was n't all such a bleeding mess , I thought vaguely , the prime minister 's delusions of success would be almost comical .
Comical ... comical ... the word triggered some neural connection .
But what ?
Gradually but inexorably , the memory of another charismatic proselytiser for Iraq 's rude health began to resolve itself .
Cast your mind back to the Iraq war as it was originally billed - the one where we won in three weeks - and which revisionist historians may just come to classify as a kind of phoney war curtain - raiser to the prolonged horror that succeeded it .
Quite the most entertaining cameo of the day - even counting Clare Short 's hilarious insistence on staying in the cabinet so she could oversee the reconstruction effort - was that played by Saddam 's information minister Mohammed Saeed al - Sahaf , who we came to know as Comical Ali .
Not for him the relentless negativity that so exasperates Tony Blair where critics of his mission 's success are concerned .
" There are only two American tanks in the city , " the information minister would beam beatifically during one of his must - watch daily briefings in early 2003 , surrounded by reporters who would have been to able to count at least three if they stood on a low chair .
Or recall his declaration as news channels screened footage of coalition troops patrolling Saddam international airport : " They are not in control of any airport . "
Listening again to Blair 's Today interview , it is easy to imagine his declarations as simply one melody in a discordant symphony , a series of those beloved soundbites that could be spliced with contrapuntal news of actual events .
" We should be immensely proud . "
Crash !
A six - hour firefight in Ramadi leaves 12 dead .
" What we had to do was rebuild an Iraqi army and police - we did that . "
Bang !
A US soldier dies and three are injured by a roadside bomb in Diwaniya .
" It is better now that [ Saddam ] has gone . "
Wallop !
A car bomb factory is discovered in Baghdad .
Just as it was with his apparent inspiration , Comical Ali , it becomes ever more difficult to avoid the suspicion that the prime minister is living in a parallel universe , where success and failure are merely states of mind .
Of course , as mentioned , the information minister 's input in this historic saga was limited to a cameo .
After being captured by coalition forces , he was almost instantly released , evidently deemed to have known so little as to be useless .
Unlike Mr Blair , al - Sahaf seems to have become swiftly aware of the limits of his appeal , and after a few TV appearances , he now lives an unassuming existence in the United Arab Emirates .
His prime ministerial imitator , however , is assumed to have far loftier plans , with the North American lecture tour a seeming inevitability .
Enthralled audiences can no doubt expect more insights such as we gained on Thursday , when the PM appeared to justify Iraq 's sprightly journey in the direction of civil war with the observation : " You ca n't absolutely predict every set of circumstances that comes about . "
Well quite .
You can , however , have a vague punt on possible outcomes , and if you are over the age of 15 , not involved in a still - unfathomed platonic infatuation with the US president , and willing to listen to intelligence you did n't pilfer off the internet , you might hazard the road ahead was slightly more pitfall - ridden than seems to have been judged .
But will the time ever come , one wonders idly , when our revisionist historians reconsider the ravings of Comical Ali ?
The idiocy of most of his statements will , admittedly , endure .
Footwear - based supremacy has not been achieved , despite the much - vaunted boast that the Iraqis would be waiting for the coalition forces " with shoes " .
But the smile fades when recalling other pronouncements .
" Do not be hasty because your disappointment will be huge , " the old crazy warned .
" You will reap nothing from this aggressive war , which you launched on Iraq , except for disgrace and defeat . "
" We will embroil them , confuse them , and keep them in the quagmire , " he said later , adding that " they cannot just enter a country of 26 million people and lay besiege to them !
They are the ones who will find themselves under siege . "
There are , of course , rather fewer than 26 million people in Iraq these days , but even those who dispute the precise extent of the population depletion might agree that it comes to something when , in hindsight , several statements by this preposterous character seem more prophetic than anything spouted by the British government at the time .
Fortunately for Mr Blair , this kind of cynicism is not voguish in the hotel ballrooms of North America .
There he may expect to be permanently cossetted against any unwelcome intrusions of reality , and we can only wish him the speediest of journeys .

Novell filed a flurry of summary judgment motions earlier this week in its ongoing legal battle with SCO .
Summary judgment motions , which are filed after the discovery phase but before a case goes to trial , are awarded when undisputed material facts nullify the need for a full trial to evaluate specific claims .
With the discovery phase out of the way , Novell is once again asserting that SCO 's claims regarding UNIX ownership are baseless and not substantiated by fact .
The question is whether or not a contractual Asset Purchase Agreement ( APA ) between SCO and Novell from 1995 included UNIX copyrights .
On this matter , SCO 's argument revolves around Schedule 1.1 ( a ) of the APA , which enumerates the UNIX and UnixWare assets conveyed from Novell to SCO .
As Groklaw has reported in the past , Schedule 1.1 ( a ) of the APA specifically lists licenses , claims , binaries , test data , and several other things , but not copyrights .
In Schedule 1.1 ( b ) , which enumerates the assets excluded from the agreement , the APA clearly and explicitly excludes " all copyrights and trademarks , except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare , " and " all patents . "
How does SCO justify its belief that Novell handed over UNIX copyrights ?
During discovery , the company offered the deposition of Kim Madsen , a SCO office manager who did n't directly participate in the negotiations in any capacity and never heard copyrights discussed at all by her own admission .
SCO bases its claims of UNIX ownership on Madsen 's personal belief that the language in Schedule 1.1 ( a ) implied transfer of copyright ownership , despite the fact that Schedule 1.1 ( b ) clearly indicates that copyrights and patents were not included in the agreement .
SCO 's UNIX ownership claim could only be described as incomprehensibly vacuous , which means that it is roughly on par with just about everything else SCO has said during its litigious reign of terror .
Novell 's filing points out that the integration clause in the APA â which states that the text of the agreement is the sole basis for the agreement â makes evidence regarding the perceptions of others ( like Kim Madsen ) regarding legal intent inadmissible and irrelevant .
We have previously revealed that SCO 's infringement allegations against IBM amount to nothing , and no evidence emerged during the discovery process to substantiate SCO 's claims of UNIX ownership .
One must marvel at the determination a company to drag out multiple cases for years on the basis of overtly baseless fabrications .
A favorable ruling for Novell would also spell the death of SCO 's case against IBM .
The trial in SCO v. IBM has been postponed until the conclusion of the Novell case , as a Novell victory would undermine SCO 's position against IBM â if Novell owns the copyrights to Unix , SCO has no legal standing to bring a case against IBM .
SCO 's case has obviously imploded , and the legal onslaught could soon come to a close .
SCO 's revenue is still rapidly declining as a result of decreasing UNIX sales and the company has admitted that it may not be able to remain liquid past October .
With SCO 's hopes for legal salvation obliterated and UNIX revenue continuing to decline , it may be time for SCO executives to move on to more practical endeavors , like claiming ownership rights of rickety shopping carts filled with aluminum cans , cardboard box domiciles in deserted alleyways , and handmade signs that read " will work for litigation money .

â¢ Read the transcript of an interview with William Clark , a / k / a. " Zeke . "
â¢ Listen to audio clips of an interview with Zeke .
The Palisades Nuclear Plant in Covert , Michigan , is real .
It produces 778 megawatts of electricity , and the electricity keeps the lights burning for about half a million residents .
The nuclear reactor inside the nuclear plant is also real .
It gets really hot , and anyone driving on Interstate 196 on his way to Grand Rapids or St. Joe can see thin clouds of steam rising from its cooling towers , as constant a presence as the weather .
The steam is real ; it 's water from Lake Michigan , pumped in to keep the reactor cool .
The nuclear power plant is on the shore of Lake Michigan , right next to the tourist town of South Haven and about eighty miles from Chicago as the crow flies .
Lake Michigan is real , definitely , though it comes off as an illusory ocean , offering the horizon as its only boundary .
South Haven is real , too , although it empties out in the cold of winter .
And Chicago ?
As real as the millions of people who live there , and the strange American fervor they generate .
Chicago is so damned real , and so damned American , that it's hard to imagine an American reality without it -- it 's hard to imagine an American reality if , say , a terrorist attack on Palisades Nuclear contaminated the big lake for the next thousand years or so and emptied out Chicago , not to mention St. Joe and South Haven and Covert .
Which is why it 's a good thing that the security manager at Palisades Nuclear for the last year and a half is real , too , with real qualifications for the job .
His name is William E. Clark , and he has been in the Army , he 's been a cop , he 's done some contracting work for the Department of Energy , he 's gone to Kosovo on a diplomatic mission , and after Katrina , he worked for Blackwater , the security company , outside New Orleans .
He started at Palisades in early 2006 .
He has a new house and a new wife and has told people , " I would shed blood to keep this job . "
As a statement of determination , this is reassuring ... but what if he means it as a statement of fact ?
What if William E. Clark has told people -- told me -- that he has in fact shed blood many times , in many places , over the course of many years ?
What if William E. Clark says that he worked for Blackwater in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as in New Orleans and killed so many people that he considers himself a cold - blooded murderer ?
What if he says that his job as the security manager of a nuclear plant on Lake Michigan is both a reward for all the killing he 's done and a means for keeping him quiet about it ?
The guilt is real .
The shame is real .
He is not proud of the things he 's done , although that does n't stop him from talking about them .
He 's not proud of what he had to do in Vietnam , his son says .
He 's not proud of having to kill someone in New Orleans , his ex-wife says .
He wakes up with nightmares , his new wife says , because he 's starting to see the faces of the human beings he once saw through the rifle scope .
And so this story represents his attempt to come clean .
He is a bad person , he says , but he wants to be a good person -- he wants to be thought of as a good person .
He wants to be purified , shriven .
He is telling his story because he knows it will destroy him .
He is telling his story because he knows it will set him free .
He has kept stuff , over the years , because he knows that nobody will believe him .
He has kept the stubs from all the boarding passes , the keys from all the hotel rooms .
There are hundreds of them , and he keeps them in thick wads and piles .
He has kept a business card for one of his aliases , Zeke Senega , a reporter for The Irish Times in Dublin .
He has kept his passports , including the diplomatic one that was required for the work he did for the State Department .
And he has photographs .
He has a folder full of photographs from what he calls an " operation " in Iraq -- an operation that ended with two jihadists slumped dead in the front seat of an Opel , their car windows spiderwebbed with the ghosts of two precision gunshots .
He also has a photo album , which he calls the Book .
The Book is not very different from a lot of photo albums -- it is a record , in snapshots , of the places he 's been and the people he 's met -- except that the mostly unsmiling men staring at the camera are usually wearing camouflage and armed to the teeth .
And in the middle of the Book , there is one photo , black - and - white and larger than the rest , of William E. Clark cradling a rifle to his chest in what appears to be a jungle .
He does not seem to be posing , and indeed he looks a little sick -- his mouth slightly slack and his long face droopy with exhaustion .
And yet when he remembers the circumstances of the photo , he relishes them : " That picture was taken in El Salvador in 1996 .
I was n't supposed to be there .
Nobody was .
Suddenly this UPI photographer shows up , taking pictures .
I said , ' If you do n't put that camera down and give me the film , I 'll shoot you .
I 'll kill you and get away with it .
Because I do n't exist . ' "
Photograph by Tom Junod
Somewhere along the line , Bill Clark from Tulare , California , became Zeke , the " shooter " in his prized photograph , above .
The volunteer is real -- so real that her name cannot be disclosed , nor any identifying details .
She is one of the Americans who volunteered their time after Hurricane Katrina flooded the Gulf Coast in 2005 .
She worked at a makeshift shelter where people were very sick and could n't be evacuated .
There were drugs at the shelter , a store of narcotics , to keep the sick people comfortable .
There had to be protection , and Blackwater USA supplied it , through a government contract .
The volunteer was happy that Blackwater was there , because she kept hearing stories of what was happening in New Orleans -- its descent into lawlessness .
It was a very scary time .
In fact , one night one of the Blackwater contractors at the shelter said he had received intelligence to the effect that a New Orleans gang had found out about the drugs at the shelter and was on its way .
He assured her that she would be safe , because he had just come from Iraq , and after what he'd been through there with the jihadists , he was n't about to be scared by American lowlifes .
He was a senior member of the Blackwater team , and he made sure that if anyone so much as even parked around the block from the shelter , there was a Blackwater contractor in his face .
Nothing happened that night , and nothing ever happened , for she had her own personal protector .
His name was William E. Clark , but he told her to call him what everyone called him -- Zeke .
She was struck by the apparent contradictions in him .
He made her feel secure , but he seemed so terribly wounded , both literally and metaphorically .
He had a problem with his neck , an injury that occasionally caused him to pass out .
When she asked him how he got it , he told her that he could n't say , that he was prohibited from saying .
Little by little , though , it came out , because secrets come to light during the night shift , and stories get told in the dark .
He 'd done terrible things for his country .
He 'd had to do terrible things , but that was because of his willingness to do them .
He was n't so willing anymore .
He was doing the worst thing someone like him could do :
He was growing a conscience .
No , worse than that :
He was talking about it .
He was talking to her .
He had never talked to anyone about the terrible things he'd done , not even his wife of thirty years .
He felt safe with the volunteer , as she felt safe with him .
He scared her a little , of course .
She had never met anyone like him .
He showed her how to use one of his guns .
She had never fired a gun before and was surprised how much she liked it .
But she also felt that he was watching her .
He even said that he was .
He would call her on her cell phone , in the middle of the night , when she could n't see him .
" I 'm sick of just watching you , " he would say and describe everything she was doing , so that she knew she was being watched .
It was obsessive , and once they came together , they came together obsessively .
She was in thrall to him , as he was in thrall to his stories and his terrible past .
She did n't know whether to believe his stories , but when she got home , he sent her videotaped footage of people being executed in what he said was Iraq .
There were voices on the video , and one of them sounded exactly like Zeke's .
Death is real .
Its reality is unsurpassed , and the people at the disaster - relief conference in Houston last July were on intimate terms with it .
They were morticians , they were forensic anthropologists and forensic dentists , they worked suicide hotlines , and they handled the public relations when airplanes went down .
Now they were all standing up and saying who they were and where they came from and why they were interested in doing work that few people wanted to do -- why they wanted to take care of the dead left behind by mass disasters .
As the attendees were introducing themselves to one another by both name and profession , a man stood up and said , " My name is William Clark , and I 'm a designated marksman for Blackwater . "
He stood out as soon as he stood up .
He was lean and he was lanky , with his face and everything else about him aligned on a vertical axis -- he had a full head of springy hair rising straight up off his scalp in a kind of modified brush cut and a Fu Manchu mustache bracketing his rabbity front teeth .
There was an arrogance in his military bearing and a desire to shock secreted in the monotonal nonchalance of his voice .
I was one of the people who gave him the reaction he was looking for , and when I asked him if I could speak with him , he seemed as though he'd been waiting for me to ask the question .
We met in a small room away from the main auditorium and away from the other attendees of the conference .
I was well aware of Blackwater and its reputation as a private security company whose armed contractors had changed the rules of engagement in Iraq and elsewhere , even in New Orleans .
I was also well aware of the reputation its contractors had for not talking , and so I was surprised when William Clark sat down and , in the same manner he used when he was introducing himself in the auditorium -- a manner at once matter - of - fact and challenging -- he started not only talking but confessing .
Yes , he said , he was one of them -- a " merc , " or mercenary , for Blackwater .
He was a sniper .
He had been a countersniper for the security details assigned to protect Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan and Paul Bremer , the former American proconsul , in Iraq .
He did overwatch , which meant he sat up on rooftops and shot people who looked dangerous .
" Hey , " he said , " thirty - seven Al Qaeda and twenty - one Baathists can't be wrong . "
At first , he was blithe on the subject of killing , saying that the Blackwater contract was " perfect for a guy like me -- a thousand bucks a day , and you get to kill people legally . "
Then he said that he must be " missing a chromosome or something -- I do n't have the moral firewall that keeps normal people from killing . "
He had met people doing body - retrieval work when he was in New Orleans for Blackwater , and when they told him what they did , he said , " You 're a taker - outer ?
That 's funny -- I 'm a putter - inner .
Maybe we can work together . "
It was a joke , of course -- the kind of bitterly defensive joke he liked to make -- but then he'd started giving the matter some thought .
He was fifty - three years old .
He was old for the kind of life he led , the life , in his words , of " an operator , " " a shooter , " " a trigger puller . "
In effect , he had given his life to take lives , and it had cost him almost everything , including , he said , as he held up his left hand and displayed a denuded ring finger , his thirty - year marriage .
He was trying desperately to adjust to civilian life , but a lifetime habit of chasing headlines did n't die easily .
He was at the conference because he was hoping that maybe there was a way to chase headlines without having to kill anybody .
False IDs and other work tools on Zeke 's kitchen counter
I called the number he gave me a few days later and asked for William Clark .
" Who ? " a voice said .
" William Clark . "
" Who is this ? "
I told him I was the reporter he met at the disaster - relief conference .
" Oh , yeah , " he said .
" I remember .
You just threw me off , asking for William . "
" Your name is n't William ? "
" It is .
But everybody calls me Zeke .
The only person who does n't is my mother , and she calls me Billy . "
There was a story he told about his first day at Palisades .
He was already at his desk when his boss came in .
His boss said , " I just want you to know you 're not my first choice for the job , so if you 're in over your head , please tell me . "
Zeke could n't help himself .
He answered , " Well , you 're my first choice to throw out the window . "
The boss beat an immediate retreat , and later , it had to be explained to Zeke that threats are taken very seriously in the modern corporate workplace .
" But yeah , he knew who he was hiring , " Zeke said when I asked him if his boss at Palisades knew what he had done for a living .
" He knew he hired an assassin . "
He had been screened , and the screening was real .
He had been checked and vetted .
The screening was standard but rigorous -- it was the same screening everyone got when they were applying for a job that gave them complete freedom of movement and access at a nuclear power plant .
His piss was checked , and so were his finances .
He was given a psychological test and a polygraph .
His references were called .
Zeke claimed to have extremely high - level security clearances -- a TS / SCI with the Department of Defense and a Q clearance with the Department of Energy -- but Randy Cleveland , who 's in charge of employee screening for the company that operates Palisades , said that he does n't generally check security clearances , because he's in the business of granting security clearances of his own .
Besides , he said , " I do n't know how much work Zeke did that by its nature you would n't be able to validate .
Some of these operations , he tells us , were of such a covert nature that you have to do an extreme amount of digging to find out about them , if you can find out at all . "
So they knew .
What 's more , they all seemed to know .
On the first day I visited Zeke at Palisades , some of his security guards were receiving special - operations training at the plant 's practice range , and all day long the people who came to observe the training seemed to know not only Zeke but also his history .
The idea for the training was based on his history -- based on his certainty that the jihadists he'd fought against in Afghanistan and Iraq would be able to take Palisades without much of a fight if the security guards were n't given the proper training .
He wound up convincing the owners of Palisades to pay $ 50,000 , he said , for the creation of an elite strike force from the ranks of his security guards , which he would call the Viper team .
He wound up inviting Aaron Cohen , a former Israeli commando Zeke had seen giving commentary on Fox News , to come to Michigan and provide Viper training .
He wound up convincing a local agent from the FBI and a local agent from the Department of Homeland Security to participate in the training and become members of the Viper team .
He wound up convincing representatives from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to come and observe the training , which he called the first - ever partnership between a private security team and federal law - enforcement agents for the purpose of critical - infrastructure protection .
And so they all came to the practice range , and they all gave Zeke credit for making Viper training happen , although a senior manager at Palisades confided that Zeke was far better at creating elite strike forces than he was at doing paperwork and dealing with corporate politics .
But this was not surprising , the manager said , given who Zeke was and where he'd been -- given that Zeke had gone to Afghanistan and Iraq looking to die and had instead wound up a security manager at Palisades .
He was still new to his house .
On his refrigerator door , he still had a drawing a little boy down the block had sent him , a stick figure emblazoned with the words mr. zeke , welcome to the neighborhood .
He had n't met the little boy yet , nor any of his other neighbors .
After all , he had not bought the house because he wanted to make friends but rather , he said , because it was at the end of a dead - end street and offered an advantageous line of fire .
The house was two stories , with dormer windows , and contained a small arsenal .
There were bullets everywhere -- in boxes , in the bathroom , on bookshelves , a few scattered on the floor -- like candy in the home of a fat man .
There were a lot of knives , too , the fighting kind , with handles like brass knuckles .
There was a handgun secreted away in the couch that faced the forty - three - inch TV screen , another next to the computer keyboard , and another on top of the refrigerator .
In Zeke 's bedroom , there were two handguns on his nightstand and a black pump-action shotgun propped in the corner .
In one of the spare bedrooms , there was an empty black case , very long and designed to carry the long rifle -- Zeke said he preferred a Remington 700 -- that snipers use .
There was a Ruger .22 - caliber Mark II long - rifle target pistol .
There was a scope next to a pair of black gloves .
There were a dozen empty magazines , a magazine half filled with bullets , and three magazines that were fully loaded .
There were a couple of holsters , a stock , a shooting brace , and a metal case filled with 7.62 mm shells .
On the floor , there was a pair of handcuffs and a big box filled with smaller boxes of bullets .
On the shelf bracketing another wall , there were two Kevlar helmets , a set of pads for a shooter 's knees and elbows , and a long coiled rope .
In the corner , there was a backpack , ready to go , and then a duffel bag , olive - green and already packed with clothing and gear , so that if Zeke ever got called on a mission , he would be able to leave -- and leave everything behind , including his new house and his new wife and his very real job at the nuclear plant -- at a moment 's notice .
He lived in fear , because he was not in control of his life .
He had a handler , he said .
Did I know what a handler was ?
A handler was a person who handled him and who handled things for him .
He 'd had a handler since 1984 .
He 'd been in the Army , been in Vietnam , been a Ranger , with marksman as his particular skill set .
He 'd gotten into some trouble , so he 'd gotten out in 1977 .
He 'd become a cop , outside of L. A .
He was SWAT .
He was , by his own description , " hard charging , " maybe too aggressive .
He made a lot of arrests .
He also spent a lot of time at the range .
One night , he said , the phone rang at his house .
" Friend of a friend .
' We hear you 're a hell of a shot .
Why do n't you come and talk to us ? '
I told him I had a job .
He said , ' Do n't worry , we 'll pave the way . '
The next day I got to work and was told to take a leave of absence .
I went for training in northern Virginia , and six months later I was in Honduras .
' There 's your target .
Handle it . ' "
He handled it , and from then on he had a handler .
It was n't always the same guy , and one time , about five years ago , it was a woman .
But the handler always did the same thing .
Made sure he was current on his piss test .
Made sure he was current on his polygraph .
Made sure he could get insurance and a mortgage .
Made sure that Zeke had a reference when he went for a job and had to explain the gaps in his rÃ©sumÃ© .
Made sure that Zeke knew where to go and knew what to do once he got there .
Made sure that Zeke followed orders .
Made sure that Zeke was still handling it , which meant that he was n't talking to anyone -- whether wife or friend or shrink or reporter .
Handling it was what Zeke was good at , until he was n't .
Now , for the first time in his life , he was scared .
He could n't sleep at night .
He had nightmares .
He was afraid that he was too old .
He was afraid that no one was going to call him with another mission .
He was afraid that he was going to get called on another mission tomorrow .
He was afraid that he was never going to go back to Afghanistan or Iraq .
He was afraid that he was going to go back to Afghanistan or Iraq and die there .
He was afraid of losing his job at the nuclear plant and winding up on a park bench .
He was afraid that he was going to spend the rest of his life at the nuclear plant , a washed - up old operator " with a lot of stories that no one believes till they see the scars . "
He was afraid of being betrayed , afraid of disappearing , afraid of being afraid forever .
" I 've hurt a lot of people , Tom , " he said .
And he knew he would hurt a lot of people again if he did n't burn his bridges to the handler who ordered him to hurt them .
" And there 's only one way I 'm going to burn my bridges , and that 's by talking to someone like you . "
He had the most amazing things to say about hurting people , about the reality of sitting up on high and hunting them , about the quiet deliberation of it , about the stillness of it , about watching a man " through the glass " -- the scope -- about watching him smoke and drink coffee and talk to friends even as you know the order is in and he 's already dead , about taking aim at his lip or his teeth -- " teeth are always good , because you can always see them " -- or between his buttons and concentrating only on the shot , on the tumbling piece of paper that helps you determine which way the wind is blowing , and then on the soft squeeze of the trigger , only that , before the kick of the rifle brings you back to life with almost more adrenaline than you can bear .
He 's always lived for the adrenaline .
We were watching an NFL game one night at his house , and he got up and assumed the stance of a defensive back , but with his elbow up high , as if ready to drop the hammer .
He said that he'd been a cornerback in high school , all county , and that he still remembered what it was like , watching a play develop , watching the whole field , the movement of the ball both chaotic and marked by a sense of inevitability , because it had to come to an end , and it came to an end when he made the hit .
He was the end .
He was a hitter , and nothing could match that feeling of intervention -- that feeling of being the instrument of inevitability -- until later in his life , when he felt the kick of the Remington 700 and heard his spotter say , " Man down . "
One night his mother called his cell phone .
She called him almost every day .
He was closer to his mother than he was to anybody , and once , when I asked him if he had any code of conduct , he said , " No women .
No children .
And I do n't lie to my mother . "
Now he talked to her for a few minutes and handed me the phone .
" Well , I 'm glad someone 's finally writing about Billy , because he's an American hero , " she said , in a strong old - woman 's voice .
Then I handed the phone back to Zeke , but he was sitting on the couch , looking sick to the soul .
" She 's so happy that I have this job at the plant , " he said .
" I do n't have the heart to tell her that I hate it .
So I lie to her , like I lie to everyone else . "
I stayed at his house three times .
The first time , last August , I stayed with him for two nights .
I stayed with him for two nights again in September .
When I visited in December , I cut my trip short -- I stayed one night instead of two -- but by that time the process of revelation that he'd started in the summer threatened to go out of control .
He had revealed secrets about himself from the moment I introduced myself to him , and yet over the course of four months he had always managed to up the ante , to suggest that behind every secret there loomed another whose revelation would prove dangerous not only to him but to me .
In August , he told me about his handler and about the remorselessness his handler expected of him .
He detailed his methods as a sniper and called himself an assassin .
And he told me that he lived in fear of being arrested for what he'd done for Blackwater -- and , by extension , his country -- in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In September , he said that it was in Iraq where he had crossed the line that had made him lose " the stomach " for killing .
" In all my years as a professional , I 've seen a lot of conflicts , " he said .
" I never committed murder until I went to Iraq . "
When I pressed him about what he meant , he said , " You 're going to get me indicted , Tom . "
And when I asked him why , he replied , " War crimes , man .
War crimes . "
And yet he kept talking , driven by his guilt and his compulsive need to tell me that he was not like mere contractors -- that he was both better and far worse .
In November , I sent him a book about Blackwater and asked him to read it .
When I called for his comments , he said that it was accurate , but only so far as it went .
" The guys in that book are really sort of knuckle draggers , " he said .
" I operate on a much higher level . "
" What do you mean ? " I said .
" I 'll tell you the next time you come up . "
And so I visited him again , one last time , in December .
It was 12 degrees in Michigan , and the phone books and old cardboard boxes that had littered his driveway in the summer were now stuck there , frozen solid .
He was wearing all black , black jeans and a black ribbed mercenary sweater , and he told me that something had changed since the last time I spoke to him .
He told me that he had gotten married .
The people who love him are real .
He has a mother and father , still alive .
He has two brothers .
He has an ex-wife , Linda , to whom he was married for thirty years .
He has a son , Rick -- -- Linda 's son , whom Zeke adopted when he was four years old .
And he has a new wife , a woman he calls Baby Doll .
They all love him , but he is afraid they would n't if they knew who he really was and what he had really done .
Does he love them in return ?
He said he did , while acknowledging that a man who could n't tell the truth about himself to those closest to him was going to have trouble with his relationships .
He had , for instance , a photograph of one of his brothers on his bookshelf , but he said that he had n't seen or spoken to him in years .
And he had n't spoken to his son , Rick , since the divorce , and although Rick lived on an Air Force base not five hours away , Zeke had never met his grandchildren .
And although he still spoke to Linda as often as twice a day -- as often as he spoke to his mother and Baby Doll -- he viewed his divorce from her as the ultimate cost of his lifestyle and its necessary secrets .
In his darkest moments , he even intimated that his handler had gotten to her , had called her and told her , well , everything , for why else would he have come home from the hell of New Orleans and heard from his wife that she wanted out after thirty years ?
He had met her in high school , in Tulare , California , in the Central Valley , south of Fresno .
She was his English teacher his senior year .
She was eleven years older than he was .
They got married in 1975 , when he was still in the Army .
They did not live together at first -- he was at Fort Stewart , in Georgia , and she remained in Tulare , teaching -- but she was always available to him , as she had to be , for even as a young man he was haunted by his past , he said , and in this case his recent past was Vietnam .
These were the last shadowy years of the war .
There was a period when he just disappeared -- when neither his mother nor Linda knew where he was -- and when he resurfaced , he had a story to tell , except that he could n't tell it .
He was bound not to tell it , though of course it leaked out over the years , both to Linda and to Rick , as did all the others .
It was hard on Linda , Zeke said , because she had to guard his secrets as closely as he did .
She was even liable to be polygraphed , as he was , and so after a while he made it easy for her -- he stopped telling her things , and she stopped asking questions .
She just knew -- and it was her unspoken knowledge of who he really was that led him to say that she was his " real wife , " no matter what , and to keep the gold band from his wedding with Linda up on his bookshelf , right next to the picture of Baby Doll .
Baby Doll was his nickname for a woman he met on eHarmony in 2006 .
Her real name was Terri , but she had a small , breathy voice , so he called her Baby Doll .
She was divorced , living with two teenaged sons , and she described herself as a " wounded soul , " for she had multiple sclerosis .
Zeke was a wounded soul , too , she said , and their relationship seemed to enter a new stage with each visit :
In August , they met ; in September , she 'd just visited him in Michigan for the first time , and he was deciding whether to " take on " a woman with such a debilitating illness ; in December , he'd just married her , because she 'd saved his life .
He 'd been all alone on Thanksgiving 2006 , eating a frozen pizza , waiting for the phone to ring and determined to " eat the barrel " of one of his handguns if it did n't .
It did , and it was Baby Doll .
Her voice gave him something to live for , and he married her a week later .
She was n't living with him , but she called his cell phone all day long , and one night , when we were out to dinner , he passed the phone to me .
Terri 's voice was just as Zeke said it was , and in answer to my question , she confirmed that she had met Zeke on eHarmony .
Then she said that she had a question of her own : " Is he wearing his ring ? " I told her that he was , although as soon as she hung up , he said he was going to take it off when he got home and put it on the bookshelf next to the ring from his marriage to Linda .
Zeke tried to continue the affair with the volunteer he met in New Orleans after they both returned home .
One day , she even received an e-mail from Zeke 's wife , Linda , while Linda and Zeke were still married .
It was an admission of failure -- an admission that Linda had never been up to the adventure of living with someone like Zeke , an admission that she simply was n't as passionate as he was .
Linda wished the volunteer luck and expressed hope that Zeke had finally met a woman who was his equal .
How extremely gracious , the volunteer thought , and how extremely odd , for the e-mail was marred by elementary misspellings and grammatical errors .
Was n't Linda Clark an English teacher ?
Then she realized something , in a flash of alarm :
The letter had been written by Zeke , from his wife 's account and in his wife 's name .
She began trying to extricate herself from the relationship , but there was a problem :
He threatened her and he threatened her husband .
He said that he had no qualms about killing women -- that when he was in Iraq , the locals had been prohibited from doing so by their religious scruples , and that the dirty business had fallen to him and had become a specialty .
He even told her exactly how he'd kill her , sticking the knife above her collarbone and flicking it toward her feet , so that , with just the barest nick , her jugular and carotid would bleed out .
And then , when threats failed , he said he was going to kill himself .
He told her he was spending Thanksgiving 2005 alone , eating frozen pizza , and that he was going to eat the barrel of one of his handguns if he did n't get a call from the volunteer , whom he called his Baby Doll .
He made a lot of threats .
Some of them were just avowals of lethal capacity -- " Hey , I 'm a trigger puller , " he said when I first met him .
" I 'll put a round in your eye . "
Others were the result of him playing around , as when I was watching TV in his living room in August and the red dot of a laser pointer started dancing around the walls .
He was standing behind me , in the kitchen , pointer in hand , and when I said , " Um , Zeke ? " he answered , " Oh , sorry .
But do n't worry -- if I ever wanted to kill you , you 'd never see the red dot . "
Others were more specific .
When he first told me about his handler , he said that he'd told his handler about me -- with the assurance that if I revealed information he did n't want revealed , " I 'll hunt you down and kill you . "
Another time , on the subject of journalistic betrayal , he said , " Never betray someone who can kill you from a thousand yards away . "
And yet for a long time I was not scared of him , because on some level he was not a scary guy .
He was a lonely guy .
He was a pathetic guy .
He was a recently divorced guy who , like every other recently divorced guy in America , had a George Foreman grill in his kitchen and a stack of DiGiorno pizzas in his freezer .
He was too hangdog to be threatening , and when he finally did scare me , it was not because he threatened me .
It was because I thought he was going crazy .
He had a photograph of a sniper on his living - room wall .
It was poster sized , and it was framed , and the man it portrayed was carrying a gauze - wrapped long rifle and wearing a hood that hid everything but his eyes and the bridge of his nose .
He looked like a primordial executioner , rising out of the swamp , and as soon as I saw the photo , I thought it was Zeke .
He had always said that I would never be able to trace him to Afghanistan or Iraq -- that his participation there , though ostensibly part of a Blackwater contract , was a " black op , " with no paper trail .
Now there was a poster in his living room whose copyright line -- " Steve Raymer , National Geographic Image Collection , 2005 " -- made me think that I had found an image linking Zeke to Iraq , right there on his wall .
He was cagey when , during my September visit , I asked who it was .
" A friend , " he 'd said .
" Misunderstood .
You 'd like him if you got to know him , but not too many people get to know him . "
And so I went home and did a search for Steve Raymer .
His name came up right away , and so did the photograph , which was available for sale , tagged with the following information : " French Soldier , 13th Demi-Brigade of the French Foreign Legion , Djibouti , Horn of Africa , 1988 . "
I called Steve Raymer , and he said yes , he was sure of the photo 's provenance -- that he remembered being out in the desert on a Foreign Legion training exercise and all these snipers rose up all around him , in terrifying silence .
Raymer did n't say a word to the sniper , and the sniper did n't say a word to him -- he just took his picture , and eventually National Geographic put it up for sale .
It was the first thing I asked Zeke about when I visited him in December , because -- even though he'd made no claims for the photo -- now I thought I 'd somehow caught him in a lie .
" Tell me about the guy in the poster , " I said .
" You do n't want to know that guy , " he answered .
" He 's a guy going through a very bad time . "
" Zeke , I know who it is . "
" You do ? "
" It 's a soldier with the French Foreign Legion in the Horn of Africa . "
He did n't miss a beat .
Standing in front of the poster , he said , " Second Para , out of Corsica , " meaning the Legion 's Second Paratroop Regiment , which is indeed out of Corsica .
" That 's where we mobilized out of . "
" You were in the French Foreign Legion ? "
" Among other things , " he said .
" So that 's you ? "
" That 's me . "
" I do n't get it .
I do n't get why you 're so coy about it . "
" I do n't like talking about Africa .
Those were the bad years . "
" Zeke , what are you afraid of ? "
" I 'm afraid of going to jail , man .
Have you ever been arrested ? "
" No . "
" Well , I have .
I was arrested for attempted murder when I was a Ranger .
McIntosh County , Georgia .
You can look it up if you want to .
It 's a matter of public record . "
He was defending a friend , he said .
The friend had gotten beaten up at a notorious brothel called the S&S Truck Stop .
With a few other soldiers , Zeke had gone back and put an incendiary device on the roof , with the intention of " burning up everyone inside , including the whores . "
The bomb did n't go off , he said , but he and the others were arrested anyway and spent nine days in jail before an FBI agent investigating the S&S for drug trafficking set them free .
The incident ended his career as a Ranger , but he said it also might have played a role in the call he received a few years later : for he had demonstrated a willingness not only to kill but to incinerate a room full of undesirables .
" Do you have things in your life that you 're ashamed of ? "
Zeke asked .
He had gone from the photo of the sniper to the couch and was stretched out on it , with his hands covering his face .
I told him I did ; of course I did .
He said , " Well , you probably do n't do them anymore .
But I do .
I keep doing them .
I seek them out . "
He was finally paying the price ; he'd had a mild heart attack the month before , on account of the stress of living with his secrets .
I told him that maybe he had received a sign that he should begin talking , starting with Africa .
He said , " You might not like me very much after I do , " and asked if I thought he was a bad person .
" I think you 're trying to be a good person , " I said , " or else I would n't be here . "
He got up and told me to follow him .
He opened the door to his basement and turned on the light .
He went halfway down the stairs and then stopped and looked at me over his shoulder .
" Have you ever been around pure evil ? " he asked .
I paused .
I 'd been around pure evil before .
I had just never followed pure evil down to the basement , and when I got there , I expected to be greeted by the grinning ricti of other journalists who 'd pursued Zeke 's story and wound up preserved in pickle jars .
But no :
It was just a basement , and Zeke could n't find the photographs of the evil he had done in Africa .
He did find , however , a big cardboard box full of the plays and screenplays he'd been writing since he got out of the Army , some of them faded with the passage of time .
The wind was making noises .
The noises were making Zeke jumpy .
He was sitting up on the couch , doing what he was always doing -- watching Fox News on the big - screen TV and revealing his secrets .
On this night , however , he was saying that everything had changed since he 'd married Baby Doll .
" I have something to lose now , man , " he said , by which he meant Baby Doll , by which he also meant his house , his job , his life .
He had told me about everything .
He had told me about Africa , about Afghanistan and Iraq .
He 'd also told me about the Philippines , about Indonesia , about Somalia , about Yemen , about Angola , about Nigeria , about Guatemala , about Haiti and El Salvador and Honduras .
He had continued raising the stakes on his secrets until they all bled together .
Indeed , he really had only one secret , because over the last twenty years he'd had only one job .
He did not really work for Blackwater , and he did not really serve in the French Foreign Legion , and he was n't a missionary for World Vision , and he was n't a diplomatic observer for the State Department .
Those jobs were just covers for his real job , which was something he called " direct sanction . "
No matter where he was , he worked for his handler , and his handler paid him to kill people .
He was , in his words , " a national - security asset , " " one of the best in the world at what I do " -- a one - man death squad .
He had revealed his secrets in order to survive them , but now he thought he had made a mistake .
He wondered if I had endangered him , and if it was the revelation , not the secrets , that would be impossible to survive .
I told him that he had no choice now but to go all the way -- that going public was the only way he could protect himself .
" Do you mean testify ? " he said , like a snake handler who had fallen from his trance and realized what he had been holding .
" No way , man .
I have nightmares about Charles Schumer asking me questions .
You ever raise your right hand ?
I have , and it's a life - altering experience .
My mother could n't stand it .... "
Suddenly he stood up .
The wind had gusted , and there was a noise .
He went to the refrigerator and came back with a handgun .
He cocked it and went to the garage door , peeking outside while standing next to the jamb , his back pressed against the wall .
When he returned to the couch , he did not uncock his gun .
Instead , he started transferring it from hand to hand and told me that I did n't know who I was dealing with : " If they want to get you , they get you .
Or they do n't get me .
They get Baby Doll .
They rape her , they sodomize her .
It 's called a break - in .
Random violence .
But it 's not , and I know it 's not .
So no fucking way .
I 'm not going to get my Baby Doll raped and sodomized so Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton can make political hay ! "
His handlers were real .
Zeke was talking to them on the phone .
I was sitting across the table from him .
It was the next day , and we were having breakfast at a restaurant in South Haven .
At 9:30 , he picked up the cell phone and dialed .
He said , " Clark , William , " and then a number , 553 .
Then he said what sounded like a last name .
And then he was talking to his handler , whom he called Larry .
He was telling Larry that he was sitting with the writer from Esquire .
He cringed at his handler 's response .
Then , as he explained later , he was transferred immediately to his handler 's subordinate , who read him his secrecy oath and threatened him with the penitentiary .
The subordinate 's name was Kyle .
Zeke complained about the way he was being treated by Kyle , then he began complaining about the way he was being treated by Larry .
When he was finally transferred back to Larry , he said this : " Hey , Larry , thanks for the kick in the balls . "
He said that if he ever saw Kyle in the street , he'd " take him out , " and then he promptly apologized for the threat .
He hung up , and when he called back , a secretary answered and told him that Larry was at a meeting .
" I just talked to him two minutes ago , " he said , and she put him through .
" Larry , how much longer do I have to be in purgatory ? " he said , and accused Kyle of selling him out years earlier .
His tone softened after that ; he said , " Hey , I 'll do it , I 'm a good soldier , " and hung up .
He finished his coffee but not his eggs , and when we got back to the car , he said , " I fucked myself .
I stayed in too long , now they have their hooks in me .
I have a new house , a new wife , a new job , and it 's all fake .
They can punch through it whenever they want to , and they just did .
The thing is , you do n't know what they can do -- so they can do anything .
If you ever hear that I 've committed suicide , investigate the hell out of it . "
A few days later , the phone in my home office rang at eight o'clock in the morning .
I did n't run to get it , though I knew it was Zeke .
All that week I 'd been on the phone with him , trying to get him to go public with his story , trying to convince him to allow me to use his name .
He kept saying that he was going away .
He was going back to Afghanistan .
He was taking a job with a company that provided security for firms trying to do business in Kabul .
He was leaving in January and did n't know when or if he was going to be back .
He had n't told Baby Doll , he said , then asked : " Do you think she 's going to be mad ? "
When the phone rang , I knew I 'd lost him .
And sure enough , when I checked the message , this is what it said : " Hi , Tom , this is Zeke .
Hey man , I could n't sleep at all last night , thinking about this story and stuff .
And I gotta tell you , man , I have nothing to do with Iraq or Afghanistan , I have no operational knowledge of Iraq and Afghanistan , I have no knowledge of any operational plans that have taken place in Iraq or Afghanistan , there 's no record of me ever being in Afghanistan or Iraq , I 'm a nonentity , I just do n't exist in any of that kind of thing , I have nothing to do with Iraq or Afghanistan .
Anything else is fine , but I have no knowledge of , there 's no witnesses , there 's nothing that ties me to Iraq or Afghanistan , never been to Iraq or Afghanistan , I just do n't have anything to do with that , I can't have anything to do with that , and I 'm sorry , I do n't want to have anything to do with my name at all with Iraq or Afghanistan , I do n't exist in that arena , never have , never will , and I just had a sleepless night last night , so I wanted to call and tell you that I do n't know anything about Iraq or Afghanistan and never have been and never will .
I hope you 're okay , your family 's okay .
I just had to tell you that .
So .
Thanks , Tom. Bye - bye . "
Was it a denial or a confirmation ?
Was it the lie that told the truth or the truth that told the lie ?
I called Blackwater , and it was exactly as Zeke had foretold : A spokeswoman said there was no such thing as a " designated marksman " for Blackwater : " It 's not a term we would use , because all our missions are defensive . "
She confirmed that a William E. Clark had worked for Blackwater in Louisiana in the wake of Katrina , but that he was " never , ever , ever in Iraq or Afghanistan for us .
He was never there on a Blackwater contract . "
And then she said , " My understanding is also that he is prone to give false information and is not to be considered a trustworthy source . "
Blackwater , of course , had an interest in proving him a liar , since he'd come home from Louisiana and told his wife and son that he 'd killed someone there .
Zeke was still married to Linda then .
He was still talking to Rick .
He pulled both of them aside and told them that some dope addict made a play for the narcotics in storage , and he'd shot him .
It was n't something he was proud of , because it was n't clean .
It was n't precise .
He 'd shot him in the dark , and he'd hit him without killing him .
The addict died eventually , but still .
He was pretty shaken up about it , Rick said -- and that 's what gave the story its legitimacy .
Rick had grown up with his father 's stories .
He 'd come to doubt a lot of them , but there were certain ones he believed , because his father was n't playing the hero .
Ever since Rick was a little boy , his father had told him stories about Vietnam -- but the story he believed was the one where the Vietnamese captured and broke him .
Why , Rick thought , would someone tell a story like that if it was n't true ?
What kind of man would try to make you believe what he was ashamed of ?
Dennis Collins met William Clark in El Salvador in the mid-nineties .
He will not say what he was doing there ; he is , he says , prohibited from saying what he was doing there .
All he will say is that he was there , and that when he was there , he met William Clark , who called himself Zeke .
They were in El Salvador for different reasons , he says , but they became friends , and when they came home , Collins started getting Zeke work .
Collins was associated with Nuclear Security Services Corporation , or NSSC .
It provided security training for nuclear facilities , and it employed a lot of former operators .
Zeke was a perfect fit , because he was so enthusiastic , such a great motivator and storyteller -- when clients gave their evaluations , " the number - one guy they talk about is Zeke , " Collins said .
Zeke 's success with NSSC led him to find work with DynCorp , the security company that provided manpower for the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission in 1998 .
And his success with DynCorp led him to find work with a company that contracted with the Department of Energy to provide assault teams -- adversary teams , as they 're known -- that would stage mock attacks on nuclear facilities for the purpose of exposing their vulnerabilities .
Zeke never would have gotten any of these jobs without Dennis Collins -- Collins was a critical reference -- nor would he have gotten the security - manager job at Palisades , for it was one of Collins 's associates who recommended Zeke for the position .
Zeke called Collins " my best friend in the business , " and Collins knew that Zeke was struggling at Palisades .
Zeke was a " shooter and operator , " he said , and like a lot of shooters and operators , he was having trouble accepting that he had become " a desk jockey . "
That was why Zeke was so desperate to get to Iraq .
He and Collins had gone to Camp Pendleton , California , for counterterrorism training about five or six years ago , and Collins had seen how some of the young marines had responded to Zeke 's stories -- they were enthralled .
A few years later , when they went back , everything had changed .
There was a war on .
Now there were young marines who had been to Fallujah , and when Zeke told his stories , they were like , You do n't know what you 're talking about , old man .
Zeke could n't take it .
He became obsessed with getting to Iraq , but then , during one of the training exercises , he hit his head against a wall and passed out .
People thought he was playing around , but he was n't .
He had a neck injury that occasionally cut the flow of blood to his brain .
And so he washed out .
Nobody 's going to hire a guy with an injury like that .
" Believe me , he 's not going to Iraq , " Collins said .
" Because if he does go , he 's either going to get killed or get somebody else killed .
But it 's tough , because he 's having a real hard time .
If you ask me , what happened at Camp Pendleton cracked him . "
Last October , Zeke ï¬ew to Washington , D. C. , and gave a presentation to the Department of Homeland Security .
He went with one of his superiors from Palisades , and with Al DiBrito and Mike Moll , the agents from the FBI and the DHS who had become part of Zeke 's Viper team .
That 's what the presentation was about : Viper .
It was Zeke 's brainchild , and now he was proposing to create Viper teams at every nuclear power plant in the United States .
The presentation was attended by Craig Conklin , the head of the DHS 's nuclear - hazards branch , as well as by other representatives from the FBI and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- " about ten people in all , " Conklin says .
Zeke did most of the talking and was impressive enough for some of the participants to consider Viper training as a " best practice , " in which case Zeke would be able to take his program nationwide .
Zeke got shot in Kosovo .
Everybody knew about it :
He told some of the shooters and operators he'd met when he was staging the mock assaults on nuclear plants .
It was part of Zeke 's legend .
He 'd gone to Kosovo for DynCorp , which had contracted to provide personnel for the State Department 's Diplomatic Observer Mission .
He had a diplomatic passport .
But he says he was also there as a cover .
He was an operative whose mission was to determine the war - fighting capacity of the Kosovo Liberation Army .
He would hike into KLA camps with not much more than a box of Marlboros and a medical kit .
He should have been shot , but people would line up as soon as they saw him .
He would spend all day stitching wounds and get the information he needed .
Then he did get shot , and the only thing that saved him was his flak jacket .
When he got home , he showed Linda the sweater with the hole in it .
Did she believe him ?
Well , she loved him , she said .
And besides , she 'd seen the sweater ; she 'd put her finger in the hole .
That was the first thing Linda Clark said to me , the first thing she wanted me to know .
They were divorced , but she still loved him .
She had known him for so long that being married to him " was almost like raising another child . "
He used to ride motorcycles with her first husband , and when she was divorced and became a single mother , he protected her .
" He always made me feel secure , " she said .
They were baptized together before they were married .
But around 1984 , he lost his job as a policeman in Visalia , California , for having an affair with another officer 's wife , and they struggled .
They struggled financially , as he wrote the six novels that never got published and wrote the stack of plays and screenplays that never got produced -- well , one did , at a community theater .
And he did make a movie .
Did I know that he made a movie ?
He did , he really did , in the early nineties , with a friend 's workmen 's - compensation check .
But of course it never went anywhere , and what kept Bill and Linda afloat , she said , was Bill 's job as a chimney sweep .
For twelve years , from ' 84 to ' 96 , he worked as a chimney sweep in his hometown of Tulare , down the road from Visalia .
" I 'll bet Bill did n't tell you about that , did he ? "
No , I said , he did n't .
It 's not on his rÃ©sumÃ© , either , those twelve years representing the gap only his handler could explain .
But wait a second -- did n't he go by Zeke ?
" Oh , I do n't know where he got that , " she said .
" Everybody I know calls him Bill .
But then he went on that trip to El Salvador and everything changed .
He was always big into skydiving , and though we did n't have a lot of money , he wanted to go skydiving with the El Salvadoran army .
I let him go , because it was so important to him , and that 's where he met Dennis Collins .
And when he came home , he wanted me to call him Zeke .
I could n't do it .
He 's still Billy to me . "
Their finances got better after that , Linda said , because Bill started doing work for Dennis , and the work for Dennis led to work for the DOE , and the work for the DOE led to work for security companies like Vance and Blackwater .
What got worse was Bill 's ... well , his problem , Linda said .
He has to make himself more interesting than he is .
He can't bear to be just plain old Bill Clark from Tulare , California , because plain old Bill Clark had dyslexia , and really suffered in school ....
" Did he ever play football ? " I asked .
" Junior varsity , " she said .
" He was too small for varsity . "
Well , was he ever in Afghanistan or Iraq ?
I asked .
" Oh , heavens no , " Linda said .
" He told you that ? "
" He also told me that he was in the Horn of Africa with the French Foreign Legion . "
" Well , he did go to Nigeria , back in the early eighties .
A Nigerian minister came to Tulare , and Bill went to Nigeria with him as a missionary .
He did n't like it very much , though .
He came back in about two or three weeks . "
She said this without malice .
Indeed , she was praying for him to see the error of his ways , so that their marriage could be repaired and they could reconcile .
She still loved the man .
She still spoke to him .
As a matter of fact , she had spoken to him just the day before , and he was saying that he wanted to break off his engagement with Terri so that he could remarry Linda .
" Linda , I hate being the one to tell you this , but he and Terri are n't engaged .
They 're married . "
" Oh , my God , " Linda Clark said .
An official at one of Zeke 's former employers confirmed that he did have a Q clearance with the DOE , which gave him access to top - secret information at nuclear plants .
But when two officials with access to Department of Defense databases -- one in the DOD , the other a screener for a private security company -- checked Zeke 's TS / SCI clearance , they found no record of William E. Clark having DOD " eligibility or access . "
That is , they found no record of William E. Clark holding the high - level DOD security clearance he included on his rÃ©sumÃ© at Palisades Nuclear .
He had never talked about his life before , Zeke said , and he was always disdainful of people who did .
He was always disdainful of both the " cowboys " who liked to brag and the " wannabes " who were endemic to the world of covert operations .
Real operators , he said , never talked about their exploits when they got together .
They talked about their wives , they talked about their families , they talked about how much they missed home .
It was strange , then , that about seven years ago he held the ultimate wannabe job -- he was an auxiliary cop in Kingsburg , California , an unpaid position that called on him only to " assist officers on duty . "
And it was even stranger when , last year , he called a cop he knew from Kingsburg named Kevin Pendley .
" He tried to recruit me to go to Iraq , " Pendley says .
" He called out of the blue .
He said he'd been over there for Blackwater and that he'd just gotten back .
He said he killed sixty - nine people . "
Rick Clark knew instinctively that his father had remarried .
He had , in fact , warned his mother that his father had remarried , although he had n't spoken to his father in a year and a half .
It was just something he felt , from a lifetime of experience -- the familiar vibrations of his father 's falsehoods .
" He 's living a movie in which he 's the flawed but sympathetic central character , a really deeply interesting central character , " Rick said .
" He 's smart enough to show his flaws , because when he does , he becomes believable , and you become an accomplice in the movie of his life . "
Was Rick one of Bill Clark 's accomplices ?
" I grew up with the mythology and to some extent defined myself by it , " he said .
" One of the reasons I went into the military was to carry on the tradition . "
Rick is thirty - five now , about to leave the Air Force , and he does n't consider himself an accomplice anymore .
" If my father told me the sun was shining , I would n't believe him -- even if I lived in the next town over , for God 's sake . "
But he did want to know one thing .
He wanted me to find out the truth of one story , because he'd been hearing it since he could remember and had built his life around it .
He wanted to know if Bill Clark had been a Ranger and had been in Vietnam .
" I really need to know that , Tom , " he said .
" Because I need to know whether everything has been a lie . "
There was no incident on Zeke 's first day at Palisades ; no threat to throw his boss out the window .
That 's what the senior manager said , the same one who had told me that Zeke had gone to Afghanistan looking for a high - velocity round between the eyes .
When I told him that Zeke had never actually been to Afghanistan or Iraq , he said , " He was n't ? "
And then he said , " You know , I 'm really glad you called , because he 's been trying to get me to quit my job and go into business with him .
He said that I had the know - how , and he had all the contacts from his years in covert operations . "
The movie was called Team Dragon .
Bill Clark got the idea for it when a B - movie company came to Tulare to reshoot some footage on the cheap , and he went out to get some stunt work .
He thought it looked pretty easy , making a movie , so he started watching movies obsessively on his VCR , with a notebook in his lap .
When he felt ready to direct , he began shooting bits of a script he 'd written , featuring guys he knew from Tulare .
One of them , Ken Washman , was bothered by the suspicion that if what Clark was shooting ever did become a movie , he would n't get paid a dime , and so he began asking Clark what it would cost to get cut in -- to make a real movie whose profits he could share .
Clark came up with a figure , which happened to be the amount of the check Washman had recently received in compensation for a workplace accident .
And so , in 1990 and 1991 , Bill Clark shot Team Dragon in and around Tulare , with Ken Washman as his star .
It was about a Vietnam veteran who had to face his demons when he found out that the NVA was selling opium in California , and it cost $ 25,000 to make .
" My wife was n't real happy about it , " Washman says now .
" She did n't really like me spending that much time with Bill Clark , and she wanted me to put the money in a piece of property or something .
I guess I would have had a better return on my investment if I did , but I would n't have had as much fun as I did running around and shooting guns out there in Tulare .
And it was a real movie , you know .
We had a premiere at the Elks club in Tulare .
Bill showed it and said , ' Well , Ken , what do you think ? '
" I said , ' Well , Bill -- it 's a movie . '
There was not a whole lot much more you could say about it , other than that . "
Zeke did n't kill anyone in Louisiana .
A former marine who was on Zeke 's Blackwater team said that no one even discharged his weapon , because it was well known that if you did , Blackwater would fire your ass .
Besides , they were in the sticks .
They were n't in New Orleans .
It was quiet where they were , really sort of boring , except when Zeke told the story that a gang was coming to get at the narcotics .
Even then , the former marine listened with half an ear .
That guy was always telling stories .
The volunteer from the shelter in Louisiana received a call one day from Linda Clark .
Linda told the volunteer that she 'd been speaking to the Lord , and the Lord had instructed her to forgive the volunteer for breaking up her marriage to Bill .
By this time , the volunteer was living in fear of the man she knew as Zeke , and so she asked Linda the one thing she really wanted to know :
Is he dangerous ?
Oh , I do n't think so , Linda said .
But what about the video footage he sent ?
the volunteer asked .
What about the footage of him executing people ?
And that 's when the volunteer found out about Team Dragon .
That 's when she found out about everything , including the fact that he had never been to Afghanistan or Iraq .
She was hoping that she could keep the affair from her husband , but she wound up confessing it all , and once she did , he forgave her , as the victim of a skilled predator .
" So I dodged a bullet , " she told me .
" And so did you . "
It was embarrassing to think of it that way , of course -- embarrassing to think that Zeke had singled me out the way he'd singled out so many others , embarrassing to think that I was one of his victims .
" Hey , look at it this way , " the volunteer said .
" At least you did n't have sex with him . "
The old soldier was surprised to hear Zeke 's name when I called him on the phone .
" William Clark from California ? " he asked , and when I told him what I was calling about , he responded immediately .
" Well , if he 's the security manager at a nuclear plant , he bullshitted his way into it .
He was like that as a teenager .
He was one of the most grandiose , storytelling individuals I 've ever met . "
Indeed , in May 1975 , the soldier had been arrested for the sake of one of Clark 's stories .
At the time , the most famous mercenary in the world was a man named Michael Hoare , who had raised private armies in the Congo and the Seychelles .
Clark said he had been a Ranger , but now , like the soldier , he was in the 34th Infantry .
He and a friend told the soldier that they knew somebody who worked for Michael Hoare , and that Hoare was looking for new recruits .
First , though , they had to prove that they were brave and that they were ruthless .
And so one night , Clark convinced the soldier to throw a bomb at the window of the S&S Truck Stop .
It bounced off the bulletproof glass and exploded in the parking lot .
They were arrested , along with three others , and spent the night in jail , before their CO got them out the next morning .
There was no friend they were defending ; there was no FBI agent .
There were only a bunch of ignorant kids beguiled by a shot at glory , and in the story the old soldier tells , " I disassociated myself from William Clark as soon as I got back to the base . "
So he was living it , even then -- the fantasy that has consumed his life , as well as the lives of everybody who has trusted him .
Court records from McIntosh County indicate that there were no charges of attempted murder , as Zeke had said ; the charge was " criminal attempt , " and it was dropped when it came to the docket .
His military records indicate that although he might have gone to Ranger School , he did not graduate , and although he was assigned to a Ranger battalion , he finished out his career in the 34th Infantry , with an undistinguished rank and without a Ranger tab .
There was no career as a Green Beret , as he had told his son ; nor had he ever served in Vietnam .
The gooks had not broken him , but he had come damned close to breaking Rick , who , when I told him the military records conï¬rmed that he'd been lied to since he was four years old , said simply , " I want to put my head through a wall . "
When Zeke had the cell - phone conversation with his handlers in the restaurant , I knew that his story had only two possible outcomes , and that both were monstrous .
If Larry and Kyle were real , then Zeke was an assassin in the employ of a secret governmental agency that had seen fit to give him a job at a nuclear plant just as he was starting to go crazy with guilt and shame .
If they were n't real , then Zeke was not just a liar ; he was a liar who was willing to engage in complicated three - way public conversations with people who did n't exist .
He was a liar with an alias and fake passports , a liar who maintained extensive stocks of boarding passes and hotel - room keys , a liar who packed a duffel bag and kept it in his house in order to further the fiction that his next mission was one phone call away .
He was a liar who conflated his lies with threats so that skepticism would be conflated with fear .
He was a deranged liar , and he was the security manager of a nuclear plant on Lake Michigan .
I have a pretty good idea of what the answer is .
After all , Zeke told the volunteer the exact same things about the handler that he told me , with the exact same proviso : that this was the first time he had talked about him to another living soul .
And Linda Clark said that when Zeke got phone calls from his girlfriends , he often told Linda that his handler was on the line , and that he had to take the call in private .
There is no handler .
There was no Larry or Kyle .
And yet sometimes I find myself wishing that there were , because the alternative is harder to accept .
In the four months I spent with Zeke , he told me exactly two signiï¬cant facts , two plain truths uncomplicated by falsehood and fantasy : first , that he was security manager of Palisades Nuclear .
And second , that last October he had gone to Washington , D. C. , in the company of two federal agents and presented his vision of nuclear security to the head of the nuclear - hazards branch of the Department of Homeland Security .
He was wondering if he should tell her .
He was wondering if she would love him if he did .
I urged him to .
It was last December , and he had been married less than two weeks .
I was saying goodbye to him for what turned out to be the final time , and I urged him to tell his new wife who he really was , so that he would n't make the same mistakes he'd made with Linda .
And then the phone rang .
It was Baby Doll .
He handed the phone to me , and I asked her why she 'd married him .
She told me that he was tall , that he was not fazed by her multiple sclerosis , and that he was , in her mind , " a gentle protector .
He 's afraid that if I found out what he did , I would n't love him .
But that 's not the part of him that I care about .
The part that I care about is the courageous part , the part that came to Michigan to start a new life without knowing a soul .
The rest -- he did what he had to do , what he was asked to do for his country .
Others did it , too , and are still doing it .
I know he has bad dreams about it .
But I want to hold him through his bad dreams .
He told me when we first met that we 're both wounded souls , and he 's right .
But that 's why I love him . "
It is easy to think of lying as a victimless crime , akin to storytelling , akin to performance -- after all , was n't Zeke performing when he was speaking to his handlers ?
All those unpublished novels , all those unproduced plays and screenplays ; and now , at fifty - three , the chimney sweep finds his true mÃ©tier , telling tales to a complicit reporter .
And yet his victims number more than those whose feelings he 's hurt , whose lives he 's wrecked .
When I called Blackwater about William E. Clark , I asked if Blackwater prohibited its contractors from having sex with the people they were supposed to be protecting .
" What ? " the spokeswoman answered , in disbelief .
" Yes .
Of course .
It 's the ï¬rst thing they 're prohibited from doing .
It 's the worst thing they can do .
Does that answer your question ? "
When I called DynCorp to see if William E. Clark was part of DynCorp 's Kosovo Mission -- he was , but he was n't shot ; no diplomatic observers were -- the spokesman was chiefly concerned with Zeke 's claim that he was really in Kosovo for American intelligence .
" He 's saying DynCorp was his cover ? " he said .
" You have to understand -- that 's the kind of claim that can put all our guys in jeopardy . "
And when I called an FBI agent who until recently had been one of the chief liaisons between the bureau and the CIA , he listened to what I told him about Zeke , then said : " Fuck this guy .
Expose him .
He 's an asshole .
Guys like that make it much , much harder for the guys who are legit . "
A story about a liar always turns out to be about one thing :
He lied .
Zeke says he does n't talk to his brothers anymore ?
He lied .
Zeke says that he threatened a UPI photographer who took his picture in El Salvador ?
UPI says it never had a photographer in El Salvador at the time in question .
And yet what haunts me are not Zeke 's lies but the truths he told , or tried to tell , from the moment I met him .
He was confessing , after all , and though his confession was a failed one , the impulse behind it brought a psychological truth -- the momentum of a man unraveling -- to his most outrageous falsehoods .
He said that he was a nobody .
He said he lacked a moral firewall .
He said he lied to his mother like he lied to everyone else .
He said that his life was a fake .
He said that he'd been a lot of people , and that he'd hurt a lot of people .
He even said , at length , in a phone message , that he'd never been to Afghanistan or Iraq .
I listened , but I did n't believe him , because as invested as I was in telling his story , I was even more heavily invested in proving him a killer and not just a liar .
I was aware , all along , that he was one or the other , but somehow I could not bear to think that he was just a liar , and neither could he .
It was too shameful .
So he said he was a killer instead , because he knew that somehow human sympathy extends to killing even as it ends at lying .
He said that he was talking to me because he needed to burn his bridges ; because he needed to be stopped ; because he did n't want to hurt any more people .
I believed him then .
I believe him now .
In April , Palisades Nuclear was bought by another firm , and Zeke 's future status was unclear .
He told a colleague at the plant that he was going abroad again .
He said he had to go to Afghanistan to " counsel " someone who had displeased the government .
By " counsel , " he meant " kill , " and he asked if he could borrow the colleague 's gun .
The colleague wondered why Zeke would want a gun , when he already had so many .
" Plausible deniability , " Zeke said .

I just played around a bit with Parsec , which is a parser which comes with all major Haskell98 implementations .
Usually if you âre doing parsing in Haskell you âre using Happy , which is a fairly typical LALR ( 1 ) functional parser generator .
Parsec is a top - down parser , much like a recursive descent parser .
Parsec provides you a monad in which to write pretty grammars ; it then returns to you either a parse value â probably a tree â or an error message .
I have to admit , the error messages it gives you by default , if you ca nât parse , are stunning .
Typically error messages are the hardest , and least often done , tasks in parsing , but Parsec âs defaults are fairly clever .
Anyway , combinator parsers like Parsec , like LL( k ) parser generators , are predictive .
I.e. , you should know what rule you âre using to parse by some finite , constant look - ahead .
In LL( k ) parsing , this â should â is a strict requirement , and is what gives LR ( k ) its supremacy over LL( k ) in terms of languages recognized ; in Parsec , it âs a performance issue .
Parsec handles back - tracking for you , but for performance reasons , the manual suggests you factor out your grammar yourself .
Example parenthesis grammar in an LALR ( 1 ) or LR ( k ) system :
a := '(' a ' ) '
| Îµ
Example parenthesis grammar in Parsec :
parens =
do
char '( '
parens
char ' ) '
< |>
I âve left out attached semantics , but they do nât ugly things up much more .
The very cool thing about combinator parsers is the integration with the main language .
Terminals , nonterminals and rules are nothing but Haskell functions and data .
Thus , if you have some grammar design pattern , such as infix operator associativity , or lists of nonterminals with some separators , all you have to do is make a new combinator .
I should say that another cool thing about Parsec is that it âs not limited to a subset of context - free grammars , or even limited to context - free grammars at all .
It âs not too much trouble to write Parsec grammars which accept non-context - free , but context - sensitive , languages .
The downside , which fits into a previous rant of mine , is that you âre shifting parsing from compile - time to run-time .
Parser generator manuals like to give toy examples and show the expressiveness and how wonderful things are , but the fact is that writing correct grammars is hard .
Maybe I âm just especially dumb with grammars , but I like to have all the help I can get .
I like it when yacc tells me I have reduce / reduce conflicts or what have you : it tells me that I have nât written my grammar correctly yet .
Also , its expressiveness and integration with Haskell , allowing you to do write non-context - free languages and crazy things like that , does nât strike me as a big win .
Any language that you âd like to express in a computer science context is certainly going to be context - free â probably much more restrictive than that â and I like the sharp division we currently have between syntax and semantics .
The simple , bitchy , LALR ( 1 ) parser generator deals with the syntax tree .
Once it hands you the tree , you can forget all about syntax and start looking at semantics .
I ca nât come up with a parsing situation in which I âd want anything else .
Update : I did actually come up with a situation in which I âd want something else .
There âs a rather famous language that I ca nât recall ( ALGOL ? ) which had no keywords .
It allowed you to write ridiculously stupid things like IF IF = THEN THEN THEN = ELSE â e.g. , IF , THEN and ELSE are regular identifiers , as well as constructs , depending on context , hence the â no keywords â idea .
Does anyone recall which language this was , and why such a brilliant decision was made to not have keywords ?
In any case it âs a pain to parse : the usual trick is for the grammar to â know â when it âs looking for a keyword , and then flag the lexer ; the lexer will then stop parsing identifiers and start parsing keywords .
It âs an even bigger pain if you want to make your parser re-entrant , and a crazy combinator parser like Parsec might just make your life a lot easier then .
Several people returning home have been hurt by munitions
Cluster bombs spray large numbers of bomblets over a wide area - which can remain unexploded and endanger civilians long after they are fired .
US - made weapons have been found at many of 300 sites in south Lebanon hit by cluster bombs , according to the UN .
Israel says all its weapons usage conforms to international standards .
Secret agreements
" We are definitely looking into these allegations and we 'll see where they lead , " State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said on Friday .
A senior White House official told the BBC that the investigation will focus on whether US - made weapons were used against non-military targets .
Washington has supplied Israel with cluster bombs since the 1970s , on the understanding that they would only be used against defined military targets .
' Balconies and roofs '
The UN's Mine Action Coordination Centre says it has found 318 sites in south Lebanon where cluster bombs have been used .
" A lot of them are in civilian areas , on farmland and in people 's homes , said spokeswoman Dalya Farran .
" We 're finding a lot at the entrances to houses , on balconies and roofs , " she said .
" Sometimes windows are broken and they get inside the houses . "
" Most of them are from America , " Ms Farran said .
According to the UN , eight Lebanese have been killed and at least 30 wounded by exploding ordnance left behind after the 14 August ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah came into force .
Hezbollah tactics
Although cluster bombs themselves are not illegal under international law , many human rights groups believe their use in populated areas violates the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks contained in the Geneva Conventions .
The Israeli army said all weapons it uses were " legal under international law and their use conforms with international standards " .
A congressional investigation after Israel 's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 found Israel guilty of intentionally dropping cluster bombs in civilian areas .
A six year ban was imposed on further sales of the weapons to Israel .
But a senior White House official told the BBC that the current investigation is unlikely to lead to any serious repercussions .
Throughout the recent conflict , Israel argued that it tried to minimise civilian casualties .
But it said that Hezbollah fighters had hidden rocket launchers in houses , blurring the distinction between civilian and military targets .

In an opinion ( PDF ) handed down earlier today , the US Supreme Court killed a class - action antitrust lawsuit that accused AT&T , Qwest , Verizon , and their predecessor companies of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to hinder local phone and broadband competition .
The plaintiffs had accused the Baby Bells of conspiring to suppress competition in a couple of ways .
First , the telecoms had , for the most part , decided to stay out of one another 's territory .
For example , Denver was ( and is ) Qwest territory , and none of the other telecoms have tried to move in .
Second , the phone companies allegedly failed to give sufficient assistance to new competitors as directed by the Federal Communications Commission and a 1996 law that allowed local phone companies to offer long - distance service if they opened up their local markets to competition .
Originally filed in 2002 , a District Court had dismissed Bell Atlantic v. Twombly , ruling that the plaintiffs ' evidence of antitrust law violations was n't sufficient enough to proceed with a lawsuit .
The District Court decision was reversed by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit .
The Appeals Court held that companies that make similar moves or act in parallel could be subject to antitrust claims if there was also a conclusory allegation of conspiracy .
" To rule that allegations of parallel anticompetitive conduct fail to support a plausible conspiracy claim , a court would have to conclude that there is no set of facts that would permit a plaintiff to demonstrate that the particular parallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than coincidence , " read the majority opinion .
In a 7 - 2 decision , the Supreme Court disagreed with the Appeals Court and threw out the case .
Writing for the majority , Justice David Souter said that the mere fact that a conspiracy was conceivable and there was parallel conduct did not form a sufficient - enough basis for the lawsuit to proceed .
" We have previously hedged against false inferences from identical behavior at a number of points in the trial sequence , " Justice Souter wrote .
" An antitrust conspiracy plaintiff with evidence showing nothing beyond parallel conduct is not entitled to a directed verdict . "
In the wake of the ruling , it will now be more difficult for consumer groups and others to sue the telecoms over antitrust concerns .
Would - be litigants would have to show evidence that an actual conspiracy exists , not just that the existence of one is plausible .
Color the telecoms happy with the Supreme Court 's ruling .
Verizon released a statement saying that the ruling gives companies the freedom they need to make autonomous decisions on which markets to enter and compete in .
" Today 's decision is the fifth in a series of Supreme Court decisions establishing that firms will not be challenged under antitrust for making independent choices that benefit consumers , " noted Verizon senior VP John Thorne .
" Today 's decision affirms the freedom to decide when and how to enter new markets . "
Japan has been hunting and eating whales for centuries .
And continues to do so today .
Despite the political guise of whaling for scientific purposes , much of the blood red whale meat ends up in Japan âs fish markets and supermarkets for public consumption .
Is Japan justified in whale hunting and being unfairly attacked by crackpot greenies , or are they really as cruel and inhumane as the Western news reports make out ?
Whichever side you are on , the fact remains that Japan âs â bi-product â of its scientific research program ends up on the plates of Japanese consumers , and is still an extremely lucrative market .
We at stippy.com went to Tsukiji Fish Markets in Tokyo to get graphic evidence of whale on sale .
The shopkeeper was even kind enough to point out which whale he was researching on his â Whales of the World â poster ( Click on image to see an enlarged version ) .
The Catch of the Day was Fin Whale on that particular day .
Without siding with either the greenies or the Japanese , let us introduce you to the background of this issue , with some real facts .
You decide for yourself which side of the fence you are on , and if you feel like letting us know , leave a comment at the bottom of the article .
Whaling Cultures in Japan and the West :
Japan âs recorded history of whale hunting goes back to the Jomon Era ( ç¸ææä»£ , from around 10,000 BC to 300 BC ) , with archaeologists having found hand spears etc from this time .
However according to historians , whaling on an organized scale began in Japan in the early 1600âs .
The traditional name for â whale â was â isana â ( åé­ ) , meaning brave fish .
Whale meat was a delicacy served at special occasions and festivals .
During the same period , whaling was becoming popular in Western Europe , especially in England where whale fat was burned to fuel street lights , and whale oil was used in Rolls Royce gearboxes .
This created an increased demand for whales , and hunting on a global scale began during this period .
( Think â Moby Dick â , the 1851 tale of the heroic Englishman captain who leads his crew on the hunt for the mighty whale . )
In fact one of the objectives of early migrants from England to New Zealand and the Pacific was to search for new whale resources to sell back into Europe .
Following the invention of the light bulb ( replacing the street light ) , efforts in whaling dropped somewhat in the West , which never had a culinary whale culture .
Although it continued in other countries including Japan , and the 200 years from 1770 - 1970 became retrospectively known as the Era of Excessive Fishing ï¼ä¹±ç²æä»£ï¼ , or the Whaling Olympics ( é¯¨ãªãªã³ããã¯ ) .
It was during this period that Blue Whales ( ã·ã­ãã¬ã¹ã¯ã¸ã© ï¼ and Southern Right Whales ï¼ã»ãã¯ã¸ã©ï¼ were fished to dangerously low levels , which sparked the cultural clash between Japan and the West that began in the 1970 âs and continues to today .
The Save the Whales Movement of the 1970âs :
Enter US popular culture and Christian righteousness in the form of Olivia Newton - John and the 1970 âs â Save The Whales â campaign .
This was perhaps Greenpeace âs most successful campaign , and is rightly credited with aiding the ailing Southern Right Whale population back to sustainable levels .
Greenpeace made extensive use of new media , such as television , and Hollywood stars to gain support for their movement .
Unfortunately , while they could have stuck with the facts such as â some species of whales are on the brink of extinction ! â and been just as successful , they also took a populist angle stating that â whales are intelligent animals , and should not be killed ! â
This took strong hold in especially the US which did not have a whaling history , and the image of a whale became synonymous with saving endangered animals .
And although the populations of endangered whale have been greatly restored , this image continues in the West today , and is center of the commercial whaling battle being fought through the International Whaling Commission .
The International Whaling Commission :
The IWC ï¼å½éæé¯¨å§å¡ä¼ï¼ was founded in 1946 under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling ( å½éæé¯¨åç· æ¡ç´ï¼ to regulate , in a commercial context , whaling and whale populations by preventing over - fishing of whales .
It was initially signed by 15 counties , and Japan was not involved ( we suspect it had more serious matters to deal with in 1946 . )
This body effectively watches over commercial whaling to ensure the sustainability of whale stockpiles .
It was not founded on the presences of conservation .
In the 1960 âs , countries such as England and Holland which had been strong whalers , finding decreasing returns from commercial whaling , gave up the industry completely , and started putting more efforts into conservation .
The number of countries pushing for a complete ban on commercial whaling grew dramatically during the 1970 âs partly thanks to Greenpeace and the Save the Whales effort .
In 1982 , the IWC determined that there was not sufficient scientific data on the population numbers and environmental conditions of various whale species , and in a majority vote , voted in favour of a commercial whaling moratorium , banning the commercial hunting of whales .
This was implemented in 1986 , and still stands today .
( There are over 70 species of whales in the world .
However , the IWC only watches over 12 species .
These IWC whales ( as they are called ) are Minke , Blue , Fin , Sei , Bryde âs and Humpback which are baleen whales , the Sperm and Bottenosed which are toothed whales , as well as the Beluga , Narwhale , Baird âs beak and Pilot whales which are in fact dolphins ( or from the Delphinapterus family . )
Scientific Whaling :
The 1982 moratorium caused outrage in traditional whaling countries such as Japan , Norway and Iceland , who have never really agreed with this and have all looked to exploit loopholes .
Specifically , the ICRW states that â contracting Governments may grant to any of its nationals a special permit authorizing that national to kill , take and treat whales for purposes of scientific research â .
From 1982 , Japan and Norway halted their commercial whaling and began killing whales under the provision for scientific whaling .
Since 1994 however , Norway has abandoned the claim of â science â and has openly called its whaling â commercial â , which the country is allowed to do because it filed an official objection when the moratorium was first put in place .
Japan however did not do so , and has taken a more condescending stance towards the moratorium , and continued to fish under the name of scientific research , officially to obtain data on population numbers , age and sex makeup , and natural death rates .
Japan states that the quality of its research research results are thought of as high quality .
And the logic behind the meat being sold in the consumer market is the whale meat not used in research should not be wasted , and is sold to prevent waste , as well as to fund further research .
In other countries carrying out scientific research , this meat is thrown out .
( A kilo of whale meat costs about 2500 yen wholesale , with the choicest cut , part of the tail , costing three times as much .
By the time it reaches supermarket shelves , the price can have risen ten - fold . )
Numbers and Statistics â The Facts :
The table below shows the estimated whale populations from the IWC .
Type Ocean Numbers Minke Whale Southern Hemisphere 761,000 North West Pacific and Okhotsk Sea 25,000 North Atlantic 174,000 Bowhead Whale Bering - Chukchi- Beaufort Seas 10,500 Fin Whale North Atlantic 30,000 Humpback Whale Western North Atlantic 11,570 Blue Whale Southern Hemisphere 1,700 Pilot Whale Central & Eastern North Atlantic 78,000
Source : International Whaling Commission Official Homepage
Additional , estimate populations include :
Sperm Whales â from 200,000 to 2.2 million ,
Bryde âs
Whales â in the hundreds of thousands , and
Sei Whales â approx .
54,000 .
So with that in mind , exactly how many whales is Japan hunting each year ?
Since 1987 , under the name of scientific research , the IWC has allowed Japan to fish 6065 tonnes of only Minke whales ( thats about 400 actual whales ) .
And since 2001 , Japan has applied to increase this to include another 100 Minkes in the North Atlantic , 50 Bryde âs , 10 Sperm whales , and 39 Sei whales .
That âs all folks .
So why the Big Problem ?
With such a raging debate over such small number of whales , it appears to have developed into a cultural clash .
Greenpeace has stooped to doing reckless things , such as when Japanese whalers have harpooned a whale , attaching its own dinghy in protest around the rope and whale being pulled up , somehow expecting the whaling boat to stop hauling it in .
This has already resulted in damage and injuries for boats and people on both sides .
Even if whales are that intelligent , how many whale lives is a human life worth ?
This shows how rational thought in this conflict has been replaced by raw emotion .
This video shows an actual high seas collision that occurred in the Southern Ocean between a Japanese whaling boat , and a Greenpeace boat .
It was highly publicised at the time , and the marketing power of Greenpeace had the world believing it was all the Japanese boat âs fault .
I am no boat captain , but looking at this , the Greenpeace boat was in a position to prevent the accident more than the Japanese boat was :

On the other hand , the Japanese side have made some childish moves .
At the IWC meeting held in Shimonoseki in 2002 , they had the audacity to serve up whale meat for lunch to the delegates of the participating countries , apparently in an effort to show that whale meat actually tastes good â .
Here is the specific whale recipe prepared before the IWC Meeting .
They have also contempt for the IWC by overtly buying votes from countries new to the Commission , such as Mongolia , one of the most landlocked countries in the world , which should need no place in the IWC at all .
Despite all the childish games , throwing of stones , and poking with sticks ; from the perspective of ensuring the sustainability of whale populations , the IWC seems in fact to be functioning adequately .
The question of whether or not Japan should be allowed to sell whale meat on the market should be something that all countries sit down and discuss like adults , based on fact , not blind faith in the supposed intellect of an animal .
And whether eating it is â right â or not , should then be up to whoever is sitting at the dinner table .
As long as my children and their children will be able to see and enjoy this large animal of the sea , I do nât have a problem if they enjoy whale meat with perhaps a bit of ginger , wasabi and garlic .
What do you think ?
Please leave a comment telling us where you stand , and more importantly why ?
WHY DO WE VOTE ON TUESDAYS ?
THE ANSWER ?
NO GOOD REASON .
Violence and video games go together like peas and carrots .
It 's no surprise that the first video game involved two spaceships trying to blow each other up .
So even though contemporary games often feature more peaceful goals like training your brain or caring for a puppy , the vast majority of them are still about the wanton destruction of other living things .
Because it just feels good .
Well , it feels good if the game is well - designed .
Three new games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 bring superhuman , over - the - top , hyperbolic violence right into your living room , but only two of them do it well .
God of War II
What 's better than being enslaved by Ares , the Olympian god of war , then being forced to hack and slash all of Greece with giant cursed blades attached to your forearms , accidentally killing your family ?
Having to do it all again , that 's what .
If you were wowed by the original , you 'll want to jump right back into the fray with God of War II for PlayStation 2 , which takes all the mile - a- minute , monster - filleting action of the first and turns it up to XI .
God of War II 's first level is an intense , epic battle with the Colossus of Rhodes brought to life .
I repeat : this is the first level .
Screenshot : SonyWhile some game designers might build a few giant set pieces , then make you spend hours grinding in each one until you 're sick of it , God of War II moves you from scene to breathtaking scene at breakneck speed .
One minute you 're clambering across the backs of a fleet of giant horses , the next you 're pulling yourself up the face of Atlas , having nearly fallen off the Earth .
Although Greek hero Perseus is voiced by Harry Hamlin , reprising his role from the film Clash of the Titans , the fight against him is brief and not especially fun .

As you gain experience , you can upgrade your weapons and restore their magic to its glory , although some are mostly useless :
Supercharging your magical bow and arrow is pointless when the screen - filling lightning magic is so much better .
And some of the encounters with boss monsters can be frustrating , or just boring .
But these are minor quibbles .
God of War II , like its predecessor , is a slap to the face of every other action game .
Its breathtaking presentation and heart - stopping action outdoes its peers so thoroughly that it 's plain difficult to play other games afterward .

Earth Defense Force 2017
I wanted to like Earth Defense Force 2017 for the Xbox 360 .
You tell me you 're releasing a game based on cheesy ' 60s science fiction movies in which soldiers wear colored jumpsuits and fight giant lizards , and I 'm there with flowers and a nice bottle of wine .
Unfortunately , in addition to fighting off space aliens and giant bugs , the Earth Defense Force also puts up a feisty defense against attempts to like it .
" Klaatu barada nikto " does n't work against these guys .
I know , I tried .
Screenshot : D3 PublisherI 'm just going to name a few of the problems with the game , because listing them all would take nearly as much time as the rather short game .
There 's no reload button for weapons .
There 's no Xbox Live capability at all .
The power - ups ( armor , health and weapons ) are pixelated and would look dated in the original Doom .
The levels are repetitive and mostly uninspired .
Your character looks like his hips are on a swivel .
Your computer - controlled allies will never shut up ever .
The Achievements are scarce and uninspired .
Upsides ?
The main one is the character design , in which all the enemies are extremely cool in a dated sci - fi sort of way .
In addition , there 's a wide variety of weapons to acquire , and it's fun to try out a new rocket launcher or shotgun .
And you get to blow up entire buildings .
That 's neat .
In general , the game provides a nice sense of scale , from the giant tower - crawling ants to the crashing spaceships .
In short , Earth Defense Force 2017 had solid awesomeness potential , but could n't turn it into an equally solid game .

Crackdown
In Crackdown for the Xbox 360 , you roam freely around a large city made up of three major islands , stealing cars , listening to the radio , taking out gang members and causing havoc by wasting innocent bystanders with heavy weapons .
Sound familiar ?
If you 've played Grand Theft Auto 3 , or any of its sequels , probably so .
And BOOM goes the dynamite !
Screenshot : MicrosoftCrackdown brings its own flavor to the mayhem pie , though .
It lacks the humor , character and variety of the GTA series , but as a trade - off you get superpowers and better controls .
You play a genetically engineered cop of the future , and you start out strong , agile and good with weapons .
As you build your skills â this may be the only game where you get better at driving by running over people â you learn to lift buses , jump from skyscraper to skyscraper and wipe out enemies more efficiently .
In fact , building your skills is more fun than the actual missions , most of which involve tracking down one crime kahuna or another and rubbing him out .
Not that the missions are bad , but after your first dozen they start to blur together .
It 's nice , at least , that the game accommodates a variety of approaches to your assassination duties , often giving you a choice between slogging through waves of henchmen or cleverly making your way directly to the boss , wiping him out and leaping away with what can only be described as aplomb .
The game could improve the targeting , and it would be nice to be able to shut off the voiceover after you get the same piece of advice for the fifth time .
Here 's hoping the next version builds on the great graphics and fun side tasks and gives us a solid main story to go with it .

WIRED : Looks great , fun powers , enjoyable side missions .
TIRED : Weak main story line , lack of character .

Long winters make cyclists do crazy things .
Sometime in early January , I decided to take a shot at a world record riding a streamlined human powered vehicle â a recumbent bicycle with a carbon fiber shell .
I 'll be aiming for the flying 200 - meter world record , which is currently held by Canadian rider Sam Whittingham with a speed of 81 mph flat .
That 's right , 81 mph on a bike , on flat ground .
I 'll be riding the Varna Orpheus , a stable mate of Whittingham 's Varna Diablo that went 81 mph in Battle Mountain , Nevada , in 2001 .
Georgi Georgiev of Vancouver , British Columbia , built the Orpheus in 1996 .
It 's a bit longer and wider than the Diablo , which is n't good from an aerodynamic standpoint , but I 'd never fit in anything smaller anyway .
The old Orpheus has had a long and storied history .
It 's a monocoque carbon fiber and Kevlar chassis design .
With a fresh coat of paint , it 's a very slick machine .
But once the top is removed , it looks more like a World War I biplane cockpit .
The subframe is made of chromoly steel and features adjustable steering geometry .
As world class streamliners go , the Orpheus is a fairly conventional design .
Some wackier designs rely on camera navigation or even require the rider to travel down the course facing backwards .
Many newer streamliners also have computer designed laminar flow shapes .
Oddly , the Varna design is still the most successful in the world and it was not drawn with the aid of a computer â it came straight from Georgiev 's artistic brain .
The Orpheus only has five forward gears and all of them are huge .
The lowest gear is about equal to the upper - middle gear on an average road bike .
Combined with a steering range of about 4 inches , starting is by far the most difficult part of the job .
Everyone who rides a streamliner has the occasional tip over and a helper is required to hold the bike steady until you 're up to jogging pace .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FAzcEPMi14
The Orpheus really comes into its own at about 30 to 40 miles per hour .
At those speeds you can finally start spinning at a decent cadence and the bike 's handling really comes into its own .
When it speeds up , its too excited to be scared , but once I get over the initial euphoria of riding this bike , I may change my tune â it 's fast .
The Orpheus cockpit is a very noisy place and there are a lot of sharp pointy things sticking out to make you nervous .
But these bikes are built to withstand high - speed crashes .
Several riders have crashed at 60 to 70 miles an hour and walked away without a scratch .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUgXtZFdUcs
I 've been working overtime to get into shape for the record attempt , but it will take some time to make myself into a Whittingham quality sprinter .
Whittingham is a very high - level amateur track racer and has been a member of the Canadian National Team .
I 'm just a former semi-professional mountain bike racer that is half a decade removed from competition .
I 'm probably at least a year away from even dreaming about 80 - plus - mph speeds .
Luckily the low altitude record is a much more reasonable 62.3 mph .
That mark is also held by Whittingham .
This is what I 'll be aiming for .
I 've hired Dave Grigsby of Everybody 's Bike Coach to whip me into shape .
As a freelance writer , my schedule is pretty open and I 'm taking advantage of it .
I 've spent many lonely hours on my stationary trainer with nothing but an iPod and dreams of going fast .
Grigsby 's workouts are planned very scientifically and quite regimented , but they are not as physically demanding as I was expecting .
At the end of every day I upload data such as wattage , heart rate , hours of sleep and any pain I 'm having to a website and Dave adjusts my workouts accordingly .
I 've never met him in person but I feel I 'm getting pro-level attention .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzFavvTqHk
The Varna and I will be taking our first shot with 19 other human - powered vehicles over Easter weekend in Casa Grande , Arizona , at Nissan Motor 's 5.6 - mile test track .
Nissan uses the track to test prototypes and concept cars .
We 're all sworn to secrecy in case we see something we should n't .
Riders will be making attempts at the hour record and the flying 200 meter .
With several world - class bikes and riders , several records are sure to fall .
The next major opportunity for a record will be in October on Highway 305 in Battle Mountain .
October seems like a long time to wait but that 's when the winds and temperatures are the most favorable .

Corel Software , who purchased InterVideo last August , have announced that they have issued a mandatory update for all WinDVD owners who wish to continue to use the software to view Blu-ray and HD DVD discs .
The update is being issued to address the recent cracks that have extracted volume and title keys from AACS - protected Blu-ray and HD DVD titles .
" Our decision stems from recent reports that hackers have illegally obtained certain software licensing keys and have used them to duplicate copyrighted content without prior authorization , " a Corel spokesperson explained in a press release .
" Corel takes this situation very seriously .
We have been working closely with our partners and other industry organizations to ensure we take the steps necessary to prevent copyright infringement from happening in the future . "
The AACS system of copy protection was designed to adapt to hackers figuring out the Device Keys for playback units â these keys combined with the Volume and Title Keys stored on each disc are used to decrypt the content .
Compromised Device Keys can be revoked , and all new high - definition discs made afterwards will simply refuse to play on a revoked device .
According to the AACS spec , only titles that are produced after the Device Key has been revoked will fail to play ; existing titles should still play back without any problems .
However , Corel warns WinDVD users that they should " Please be aware that failure to apply the update will result in AACS - protected HD DVD and BD playback being disabled , " implying that no high - def discs will play without applying the update .
It is possible that Corel designed the software to check for updates in the background and simply disable Blu-ray and HD DVD functionality if a new update was found but not installed .
However , it seems more likely that Corel merely neglected to mention this aspect of the AACS specification .
While the hackers responsible for the AACS cracks did not mention WinDVD by name , it was clear that they were using this software to make their discoveries .
Reaction to Corel 's announcement has been fairly muted : everyone expected this patch to arrive , and the hacking community hopes that the new Device Key for the updated software will be found soon .
The battle between hackers and copy protection developers will continue , with neither side gaining a decided advantage just yet .

Entire organs could be grown from stem cells British scientists have grown part of a human heart from stem cells for the first time .
Heart surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub , who led the team , said doctors could be using artificially grown heart components in transplants within three years .
His researchers at Harefield hospital managed to grow tissue that works in the same way as human heart valves .
Sir Magdi told the Guardian newspaper a whole heart could be produced from stem cells within 10 years .
' Common pathway '
The team which spent 10 years working on the project included physicists , pharmacologists , clinicians and cellular scientists .
You can see the common pathway of death and suffering is heart failure
Sir Magdi Yacoub Researchers will see their achievement as a major step towards growing entire organs for transplant .
Stem cells have the potential to turn into many different types of cell .
Many scientists believe it should be possible to harness the cells ' ability to grow into different tissues to repair damage and treat disease .
Previously , scientists have grown tendons , cartilages and bladders , which are all less complex .
Sir Magdi , professor of cardiac surgery at Imperial College London , had been working on ways to address a shortage of donated hearts for patients .
Entire heart hope
He said he hoped that soon an entire heart could be grown from stem cells .
STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY
Key sources for stem cells are adult organs or embryonic cells Adult stem cells are identified and separated from other cells Embryonic stem cells are removed from 5 - day - old embryos Cells are manipulated to stimulate them to take on a specific function Specialised cells may then be used to treat unhealthy areas BACK NEXT 1 of 5
He added : " It is an ambitious project but not impossible .
If you want me to guess I 'd say 10 years . "
His team extracted stem cells from bone marrow and cultivated them into heart valve cells .
After they were placed in scaffolds formed from collagen , 3 cm - wide discs of heart valve tissue were formed .
Later in the year , these will be implanted into animals such as sheep or pigs to see how well they fare .
Heart valves do not simply open and close like the artificial alternatives currently used in surgery , they are able to anticipate changes in the way the blood flows , and respond accordingly .
Professor Yacoub 's team hope the valves they are growing will be equally sophisticated .
No drugs
In theory , if the valve was grown from the patient 's own cells there would also be no need to take drugs to stop the body rejecting it .
They would also be potentially much longer lasting than artificial valves , which often have to be replaced after several years .
Dr Adrian Chester , a senior member of the research team , said : " We are attempting to grow a valve that will be functional in adults and children and will be made entirely of living tissue .
" Hopefully it will be able to adapt to its environment , and then just sit there and function just as a normal valve functions under normal physiological conditions . "
Dr Chester said ultimately the work could mean that some patients might be able to avoid a heart transplant .
Dr Stephen Minger , a stem cell expert at London 's King 's College , said Sir Magdi 's team were at the forefront of tissue engineering for cardiac disease .
" If the valves they 've engineered prove successful in experimental animals , this could open the door to generating complex tissues from stem cells for a wide variety of clinical application .
" But as they stress , this is very preliminary work and the direct translation to human is still some way off in the future . "
Professor John Martin of the British Heart Foundation , which supported the research , said : " This opens the possibility that whole parts of the heart may be made in the laboratory from the patient 's own stem cells .
"

He said patients could benefits because using the tissue could prevent the need for a heart transplant .
Professor Martin added : " Although the work carried out the Harefield is exciting there is a long road to be travelled before patients awaiting heart transplants will benefit from this research . "
Heart disease is the UK 's biggest killer .
More than 200,000 people died from heart disease and strokes in 2004 .
And in 2003 nearly 10,000 people needed surgery to replace heart valves with artificial ones .

The Phoenix Mars Mission heads for the Red Planet in August
The new method of scanning for water offers vastly more accurate readings than before , they say .
The data could prove vital for the Phoenix Mars Mission which launches this August and which will put a lander on the surface to dig for ice .
The new data shows wide variation as to how deep below the surface ice exists .
Seasonal changes
The deposits - far beyond the ice that is known to exist in the planet 's North Pole - could be so large that were they to melt , they would deluge the planet in water forming an ocean .
Up until now , scientists had been able to search for water deposits using a spectrometer fixed to the orbiting Mars Odyssey spacecraft .
It is a device that measures gamma rays coming from a planet to detect different materials .
However , only readings that are accurate to within several hundred kilometres can be obtained .
Now Dr Joshua Bandfield of Arizona State University has devised a new method for detecting ice .
By comparing seasonal changes in thermal infrared patterns , detected by the same Odyssey spacecraft , he says he can make readings accurate to within just hundreds of metres .
Dr Bandfield said water ice in terms of surface area would be " probably roughly a third to a half " .
Though there is plenty of water ice , the new thermal imaging data also shows that there is considerable variation across the planet in terms of how far down ice can be found .

A talk by Phil Gossett given in Google 's Advanced Programming Language series .
Cites my work on type classes and the Girard - Reynolds isomorphism ; I was pleased to see he began by discussing Frege and Russell , and finished by describing Lennart Augustsson 's Djinn .
Nice talk , and has me looking forward to speaking at Google ( which I 'm scheduled to do this Friday ) ; my talk will cover some similar material .
( I tried to find Gossett 's e-mail and failed , maybe this will help me get in touch . ) I spotted a couple of technical errors in the talk .
( 1 ) He suggested that the Girard - Reynolds Isomorphism guarantees that every term that has a given polymorphic type is isomorphic ; in fact , distinct proofs of a theorem correspond to distinct terms of a type .
( 2 ) In answer to a question , he said that parametricity does not extend to type classes ; in fact , my paper Theorems for Free includes a sketch of how parametricity does extend to type classes ( see Section 3.4 ) .
Streetlights that adjust their light output according to the phases of the moon â this design idea was the winner of Metropolis Magazine âs Next Generation design awards .
These streetlights would have light sensors built into them that are sensitive enough detect the brightness of the moon , and dim themselves accordingly .
For example , if there was a full moon with a clear sky , the lights would be dimmed to 10 % of their power , whereas a moonless night would mean lights come on at fully intensity .
Since the streetlights would also make use of energy efficient LEDs , the combined savings would be 90 - 95 % over a traditional streetlight .
It seems that everyone from Paris to Paris â dog Tinkerbell are wearing plaid and houndstooth this season .
The bold patterns have been becoming more and more popular thanks to designers such as Diane von Furstenberg who have used the striking designs on their runway more recently .
Houndstooth prints are coming out now in both larger or smaller checks and are making a comeback since the original design became popular in the 1930 âs and then again in the 1970s .
Plaid is another bold design that is making a comeback , and can be seen on Gwen Stefani and Jessica Simpson .
Tell us what you think of Plaid and Houndstooth â would you wear it ?
A wireless network that employed less protection than many people use on their home systems appears to be the weak link that led TJX Companies , the US - based retailing empire , to preside over the world 's biggest known theft of credit - card numbers .
Despite a market capitalization of almost $ 13bn , it appears the company could n't afford to secure its Wi-Fi network with anything more robust than the woefully inadequate Wired Equivalent Privacy protocol .
( The much more secure Wi-Fi Protected Access has come standard on most routers for four years now . )
It also failed to use firewalls or install software patches and disregarded requirements imposed by Visa and MasterCard concerning how card information is stored and transmitted .
According to a front - page article in today 's Wall Street Journal , the nonfeasance allowed hackers to use a simple telescope - shaped antenna and a laptop to intercept data flowing through a Wi -Fi network used at a Marshalls discount clothing store near St. Paul , Minnesota .
" It was as easy as breaking into a house through a side window that was wide open , " a person familiar with the investigation told the Journal .
The hackers , who bore the hallmarks of Romanian gangs and Russian organized crime groups , were able to eavesdrop on employees logging into TJX's central server in Framingham , Massachusetts , where the miscreants eventually were able to set up their own accounts .
From then on , they were able to log onto the system remotely , from anywhere in the world .
The trespassers brazenly used the network as a communication post , leaving each other encrypted messes so one would n't duplicate the work of another .
They also may have lifted card information that was being processed over the network , taking advantage of TJX 's failure to use encryption when transmitting the data , as required by credit - card company guidelines .
TJX has fessed up to losing 45.7 m credit and debit card numbers and personal information relating to almost 500,000 people .
But according to one person , the thieves may have purloined as many as 200 m accounts .
( TJX rejects that claim as " speculation . " )
Stolen card numbers have been used in at least seven US states and at least eight countries , including Mexico , China , Italy , Australia and Japan .
In one case , police in Florida charged a single gang with using hacked TJX card data to steal $ 8 m in transactions at Wal - Mart Stores and other outlets .
All told , the breach could cost TJX $ 1bn over five years in costs for consultants , security upgrades , attorney fees and damage - control marketing , analysts from Forrester Research estimate .
Significantly , Forrester 's estimate does n't include liabilities that may result from lawsuits , such as one recently filed by associations representing almost 300 Northeastern banks in the US .
Plenty of banks have been saddled with costs resulting from the breach .
Banking associates are lobbying federal and state lawmakers for legislation that would require companies who suffer security breaches to absorb the costs of issuing new credit cards . Â®
ClÃ©ment Sire is n't just a statistical physicist â he's also a champion bridge player .
Combining his love of physics and games , he has created a model of the poker variant Texas hold 'em that enables him to do everything from predicting the length of a tournament to figuring out his ranking simply by assessing the average size of his opponents ' fortunes .
It may seem like an odd way to spend his time .
After all , is n't physics supposed to be about particle colliders and superconductivity ?
" Physicists , " Sire explains , " are now more than ever involved in the study of complex systems that do not belong to the traditional realm of their science . "
Sire , of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics , University of Toulouse , France , published his work Universal Statistical Properties of Poker Tournaments on arXiv.org .
He used real data from online poker tournaments and found that it matched the results of his model .
" What 's exceptional about this paper is that ClÃ©ment somehow took what seems to be a complex and mysterious system and quantified it [ with the tools of statistical mechanics ] in a very precise way , " says Sidney Redner , a physicist at Boston University who works on related problems .
Poker is an especially attractive subject , because it's one of the few truly isolated systems .
Unlike , say , the stock market , which is often governed by factors such as politics , war and weather , poker tournaments are not affected by external phenomena .
As a result , even Sire 's simplified model of Texas hold 'em appears to mathematically express many features of the game that experienced players would recognize .
In the model , poker hands are represented by a random value between 0 ( bad ) and 1 ( best possible ) .
The " blind , '' or minimum , bet for any table of 10 players gradually increases as the tournament progresses .
In any given hand , players can either fold , bet the blind , or go " all - in , " as in bet all of their chips .
Sire 's model includes functions that reproduce the most basic tasks a poker player must carry out , such as deciding whether to bet strictly on the strength of his or her hand .
Using the model , Sire discovered that there is an optimal value for a player 's tendency to go all - in .
This value , which he calls q , varies depending on whether a player has few or many chips .
But any player , whose average tendency to bet the farm deviates from q , is going to win less often than a player whose tendency to go all - in is closer to q , he says .
Predicting Rank
One feature of Sire 's model came directly from his own experience playing in poker tournaments .
" I noticed when playing that when I had twice the number of chips as the average , " he says , " I was typically in the 10 best people of a 100 - person tournament . "
Curious , he used data from his model to graph the rankings of players versus the number of chips they held .
He found that his anecdotal observations were correct and , also , that his model almost perfectly matched the data he had gathered from online poker tournaments .
You 're Only as Rich as the Size of Your Tournament
Sire also discovered that the maximum number of chips held by the " chip leader , " or the player with the most chips at any given time , as well as the total number of chip leaders , are both a function of the number of players who enter a tournament .
( Specifically , they 're proportional to the logarithm of the initial number of players . )
" This phenomenon has been observed in many different models involving competing agents , " Sire notes .
" In models of biological evolution , it shows up where you have many species who compete and there is one prominent , or leading , species . "
Instinctive Math
In Internet Texas hold 'em poker tournaments , the minimum bet goes up exponentially over time , which means that it increases by a factor of 10 every hour or two .
Tournament organizers do this to ensure that tournaments with 10,000 players do n't take 100 times longer to complete as those with only 100 players .
" The increase of the [ minimum bet ] in tournaments is only to ensure that the number of players decreases sufficiently fast , " Sire says .
" What 's interesting is that organizers must intuitively know this , even though they do n't know the math behind it .
Essentially they have estimated the rate at which they should increase the blind , but with [ my model ] they can control very accurately the duration of the tournament . "
Winning with Physics
Sire 's ability to reproduce many of the characteristics of a poker tournament indicates that , when taken as a whole , the features of these tournaments are entirely predictable .
Before anyone attempts to use Sire 's model to plot a winning strategy , however , they should take heed of Sire 's findings .
It turns out that the distribution of the " stack , " or fortune , of the chip leaders across tournaments mirrors the pattern found in the distribution of maximum temperatures during every August in history or countless other natural phenomena where physicists have attempted to predict the nature of extreme values .
This pattern , called the Gumbel distribution , means that the frequency with which chip leaders accrue fortunes of any given size is , in a way , a natural phenomenon that arises as much from the characteristics of the game being played as from the dispositions and abilities of those playing it .
" To have the Gumbel distribution show up here makes sense in hindsight , " says Redner , " but it is beautiful to see someone find it in this area for the first time . "
DIGG THIS
Regnery âs Politically Incorrect Guide series is turning out to be surprisingly good .
Of course I knew I would enjoy Tom Woods â PIG to American History , but I was also fascinated by Tom Bethell âs PIG to Science .
What makes these books so good is that they make simply shocking assertions â e.g. that the so - called Civil War was nât just about slavery , or that it is an open question whether HIV causes AIDS â and then back them up with careful scholarship .
In this respect , the cartoonish illustrations and bullet - point summaries may have misled the sympathetic reader .
Yes , part of the point of the PIG series is to annoy the heck out of the left - liberal media establishment .
But far from relying on an anti-intellectual , hick " You gonna trust them - there college perfessors with all that book learnin â ? " - type argument , on the contrary the PIG books make careful , well - reasoned cases and quote experts in the fields under discussion .
The latest addition to the series is my own Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism .
I know I âve lived up to the " shocking " assertions of my predecessors ; in this book I question the need for child labor laws , Civil Rights legislation , and medical licensing , and I defend golden parachutes for canned CEOs as well as outsourcing and trade deficits .
And if I may be so immodest , I âd like to think that my arguments on all of these points do not betray a simpleton apologist for corporate America , or a closet racist .
( If the experience of Tom Woods is any guide , though , I âm sure hostile reviewers will draw such conclusions . )
The Style and Structure
The basic structure of my book is to take on a wide range of topics â including oil profits , unequal wages , the environment , discrimination , safety regulation , globalization , and more â and first summarize the typical anti-capitalist condemnation relevant for that topic .
This reminds the reader of the " politically correct " version that he âs heard growing up and every time he turns on the news .
After reviewing the basic case against the free market for the topic in question , I then go through and pick apart every component of the criticism .
By the end of the chapter , I âve ( hopefully ) convinced the reader that it is the government that causes ( or at least exacerbates ) the problem under discussion , and that the best antidote is not more regulations or federal dollars , but rather more freedom .
Just to clarify , the PIG to Capitalism is not a textbook in economics .
If you want that , Gene Callahan âs Economics for Real People is a better choice .
Having said that , the PIG to Capitalism does provide a very good introduction to " thinking like an economist " on a wide range of topics .
If you âll forgive my quotation from the back cover :
Dr. Murphy has the gift of making clear and simple what appears to be confusing .
While many economists attempt to complicate issues in order to " prove by intimidation , " Dr. Murphy makes the argument with such clarity that the average reader will wonder why she did nât figure this out in the first place .
~ Gary Wolfram , Chair of Hillsdale College âs Economics Dept .
Oldies But Goodies â¦
Much of what I do in this book is simply codify the best arguments for the free market that I âve encountered over the years .
For those of you who ( like me ) have been in the movement for a while now , you wo nât learn anything new here , but even so the book will serve as a great reference when your socially conscious egalitarian buddy starts arguing with you .
For example , remember that great Thomas Sowell quote about affirmative action causing blacks to fail in disproportionate numbers in higher education , because the brightest black students get artificially bumped up into schools that are a bit too hard for them ?
Yeah , I loved that argument ( and his data to back them up ) too â and that âs why they âre in my book .
Ditto for Jane Jacobs â critique of city zoning , and Milton Friedman âs condemnation of medical licensure .
â¦ but Plenty of New Material Too
Beyond the synthesis of classic responses to the " tough questions , " I âve dug up some new research and provided some original arguments in the book too .
Besides my defense of outsourcing , capital export , corporate raiders , and financial derivatives ( developed in the last year or so in articles at Mises.org ) , I discuss shocking new research on airbags that I have nât seen other libertarians discuss .
Hint : Airbags are dangerous not just for frail women and children .
Want to know more ?
I guess you âll just have to buy my book .
( What did you expect from a capitalist pig ? )
" Yeah but you must have sold out ! "
The last plug I âd like to make for the fairly radical readers of LRC is that the people at Regnery were very pleasant to work with .
When I first opened the Word document containing their initial edits to my manuscript , I half dreaded what I âd find .
Surely they would take out the chapter blaming slavery on the government , or at the very least the Hans Hoppe quote where he said being a privately owned slave was nât as bad as being a government slave .
Nope , they left that heated material in , and I was never pressured to tone things down or put in weasly " Sometimes federal safety regulations are a good idea , but often they go awry " - type disclaimers .
The final result ?
The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism is probably the most radical defense of the free market that you can get at Barnes & Noble .
Fans of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard can pass it along to their more mainstream colleagues without feeling like sell - outs .
So go buy yourself a copy , and ten more for your intellectual ( but oh so confused ) friends .
And remember , every copy you buy puts more money in circulation and hence boosts GDP .*
* Oh wait , I debunked that silly logic in Chapter 10 .
The Best of Bob Murphy
They are being " interrogated , " apparently .
The news reports put that word in quotation marks .
I wonder if it emerges that they are being subject to George W. Bush 's preferred euphemism " coercive interrogations . "
And if that turns out to be the case , and we have to pray it is n't , then what will the United States and its ally Great Britain say in complaint ?
After all , Iran is only doing to Western soldiers in captivity what the U.S. has been doing to " enemy combatants " since the war began .
Then there 's a question of what kind of trial they might face .
One in which their defense gets a chance to see all the evidence against them ?
Oh , wait ... we do n't do that either .
The first strategic crisis created by the Bush - Cheney torture regime is now occurring .
It wo n't be the last .
And if these British sailors are found to have been mistreated and their " trials " tainted , who in the international community is now going to come to Britain 's and America 's defense ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
As a parent , it is how your home and family work as a culture that sets the path for your child .
It is the same for an organization today .
In a complicated world - you can and should control events .
In a complex world you cannot control events - there are too many interacting variables .
So what can you do ?
In my recent Mr. T post , I discussed the difference between complex and complicated problems .
In the book More Space , Johnnie Moore defines the two as follows :
" The wiring on an aircraft is complicated .
To ï¬gure out where everything goes would take a long time .
But if you studied it for long enough , you could know with ( near ) certainty what each electrical circuit does and how to control it .
The system is ultimately knowable .
If understanding it is important , the effort to study it and make a detailed diagram of it would be worthwhile .
So complicated = not simple , but ultimately knowable .
Now , put a crew and passengers in that aircraft and try to ï¬gure out what will happen on the ï¬ight .
Suddenly we go from complicated to complex .
You could study the lives of all these people for years , but you could never know all there is to know about how they will interact .
You could make some guesses , but you can never know for sure .
And the effort to study all the elements in more and more detail will never give you that certainty .
So complex = not simple and never fully knowable .
Just too many variables interact .
Managing humans will never be complicated .
It will always be complex .
So no book or diagram or expert is ever going to reveal the truth about managing people .
But do nât panic .
We can manage people if ... "
( Yes , that 's a tease to get you to read the rest ! )
Henceforth here at Spooky Action , we will use these definitions for the terms complex and complicated .
They define a profound and very useful difference between types of problems and systems .
The difference is important because you can't control complex systems .
It 's a mathematical impossibility .
The Conant - Ashby Theorem : " Every good regulator of a system must have a model of that system . " leads to the Law of Requisite Variety : " That the available control variety must be equal to or greater than the disturbance variety for control to be possible " , which is to say , that the control mechanism of a thing must be more complex than the thing being controlled .
To continue with Johnnie 's airplane metaphor , the autopilot system has to have greater control variety than the plane itself .
The analogy to business is that managers often want to see new initiatives as complicated when they are in fact complex , and thus design complicated systems to manage the change .
Which usually fail miserably in very short order when they encounter a circumstance outside of the control model .
The problem with designing control mechanisms for organizational change management is that the system being controlled consists of the entire contents of the minds of the effected group !
That is the epitome of a complex system .
Of course , as Johnnie notes , if we abandon the idea of controlling complex systems and focus on intelligently influencing them , we 'll have greater success .
Here is how FairPlay works :
When you buy songs at the iTunes Music Store , you can play them on one â and only one â line of portable player , the iPod .
And when you buy an iPod , you can play copy - protected songs bought from one â and only one â online music store , the iTunes Music Store .
The only legal way around this built - in limitation is to strip out the copy protection by burning a CD with the tracks , then uploading the music back to the computer .
If you âre willing to go to that trouble , you can play the music where and how you choose â the equivalent to rights that would have been granted automatically at the cash register if you had bought the same music on a CD in the first place .
Even if you are ready to pledge a lifetime commitment to the iPod as your only brand of portable music player or to the iPhone as your only cellphone once it is released , you may find that FairPlay copy protection will , sooner or later , cause you grief .
You are always going to have to buy Apple stuff .
Forever and ever .
Because your iTunes will not play on anyone else âs hardware .
Unlike Apple , Microsoft has been willing to license its copy - protection software to third - party hardware vendors .
But copy protection is copy protection : a headache only for the law - abiding .
Microsoft used to promote its PlaysForSure copy - protection standard , but there must have been some difficulty with the â for sure â because the company has dropped it in favor of an entirely new copy - protection standard for its new Zune player , which , incidentally , is incompatible with the old one .

Update
Thanks to drational again for the transcript .
Update Over the Edge kindly gave a link to Mary2002's previous diary on Comey .here
The logical assumption was that the focus of the testimony would be about the fired U.S. Attorneys General .
Senator Charles Shumer opened with questions about the recertification by the DOJ of a program near and dear to the White House 's black heart .
While Comey refused to name the program because of attorney / client privilege and security reasons , it was clear that it was the " illegal " wire - tapping fandango .
Shumer asked Comey to replay the scenario which occurred on March 11 , 2004 .
The program had to be recertified by DOJ every 45 days and the deadline was March 11 .
Comey and Ashcroft had previously requested a legal opinion from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel regarding the legality of the program .
The conclusion appears that OLC deemed the program not to pass legal muster .
Ashcroft had fallen seriously ill just before this event and was rushed to the hospital .
The White House , via Andrew Card and Alberto Gonzales ( then WH Counsel ) started putting the pressure on Comey to certify the program , which he refused .
On his way home after work , he received an urgent call from Mrs. Ashcroft indicating that Card and Gonzales were heading to the hospital to get the barely conscious Ashcroft to certify .
Comey immediately notified a couple of members of his staff to high - tail it over to the hospital as he did a U - turn and sped there himself .
They barely beat out the two goons .
Card and Gonzales ignored everyone in the room and went to Ashcroft 's bedside with the papers for him to sign -- it was an Executive Order .
Comey thought Ashcroft was barely compis , but to his surprise , Ashcroft repeated significant portions of his conversation with Comey weeks before and refused to sign .
Card and Gonzales barreled out of the room furious .
Shortly thereafter , Card called Comey to come to the WH for an 11 p.m. meeting .
Comey indicated that he would come only with someone as a witness and said he was bringing Ted Olsen .
Once at the WH , Card refused to let Olsen in for the first part of the meeting .
After about 15 minutes of discussion , Olsen and Gonzales came in for the remainder of the discussion .
Much to Comey shock , the WH certified the program without the DOJ .
Comey drafted his resignation and a number of senior DOJ officials including Ashcroft threatened to resign .
At a March 12 briefing , the President requested a meeting with Comey most likely because of the rumor of revolt in the DOJ .
Comey told the President that he should speak to FBI Director Meuller .
Afterwards , the WH , through Meuller indicated that they would allow Comey to fix the problem ( aka , make it legal ) .
Two weeks later , DOJ offered a revised program which they certified .
The illegal program was in existence for those two weeks .
Comey indicated that he still had resistence from Cheney and his gang .
He also indicated that one of his staff members who was at the hospital with him was deliberately overlooked for promotion , and he believed that it was in retaliation for being present with Comey and Ashcroft .
This testimony is a blockbuster .
It was short and to the point .
The only Republican who showed up was Arlen Specter who seemed to try to elicit testimony that certification was not required , rather custom .
I do n't think he was successful in softening the blow .
Here we have the first real clear cut evidence of the illegal activity by the WH .
Yes , I know , we can repeat a long list of other things , but this one has all the makings of high drama that the average person can understand .
It is time to drag Gonzales back before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer to these allegations
Rationality and Game Theory

Introduction
If you were offered $ 1000 , no strings attached , you would probably take the money .
And run ?
If the amount were $ 10,000 rather than $ 1000 , again , no strings attached , you would probably take the money , and run even faster .
However , if you saw a $ 100 bill lying on the street , and your back had been giving you agonizing pain recently , though currently you were in no pain , you might not bend over to pick it up .
Certainly for a quarter ( 25 cents ) it would not be worth it to stoop over .
In explaining and offering advice about economic behavior , economists and mathematicians invoke arguments about " rational " behavior to explain what actions people should take .
However , as the example above shows , if the decision maker has more information ( the state of her back ) than the observer , then the behavior observed may be different from the behavior expected .
The Theory of Games , pioneered by the mathematician John Von Neumann ( 1903 - 1957 )
and the economist Oskar Morganstern ( 1902 - 1976 ) ,
offers a variety of thought - provoking examples where the difference between the behavior that logic dictates and the behavior actually seen are worlds apart .
Thus , Game
Theory offers mathematicians , psychologists , political scientists , philosophers , economists , and other scholars an exciting playground for exploring fascinating ideas and a tool for probing a wide variety of problems that are at the core of their disciplines .
If one views game theory from a mathematical modeling point of view , where parts of game theory are used to provide a representation for behavior in the " real world , " then experiments involving games offer not only a way to improve our insights into human behavior but also a way to develop new approaches and ideas for game theory itself .
Those who are familiar with the theory of games may wish to skim the next section which deals with some relatively well known aspects of game theory .
The goal of this preliminary material is to serve as a contrast between what " standard " game theory wisdom suggests about certain games and the way these games are played in practice .
Game Theory : The Basics
Game theory has grown into a complex and multi- branched subject .
The basic idea is that one has a group of people ( usually referred to as players ) who are interacting with each other with some conflict the group desires to resolve .
For simplicity , let us consider only two people ( countries or companies ) as players .
Depending on the actions or decisions that are taken by the players , different " payoffs " will accrue to the two people involved .
We will assume that the games involved are games of perfect information .
This means that each player knows exactly what actions are open to him / her and to his / her opponent .
It is also assumed that the payoffs to each player are known and what the value of each payoff is .
The games we are interested in here typically arise in daily life , economics and political science ( law ) , in contrast to games such as Nim , Dots and Boxes , and Hackenbush , which are sometimes called combinatorial games .
The examples below give the range of conflict situations that game theory illuminates .
Situation 1 :
A husband and wife are trying to decide what do on Friday night .
The husband would like to see a movie but the wife would like to go to the opera .
Situation 2 :
Country X has threatened to test a newly developed nuclear weapon underground and Country Y is upset about the possibility .
Situation 3 :
Two children simultaneously flash either two fingers or one finger .
If the sum is even , each child wins a dime ; if the sum is odd , each child loses a dime .
Situation 4 :
Two competing electronic stores must decide whether to use television advertising during the week before the Thanksgiving holiday .
These situations show a small sample of various degrees of seriousness of consequences to the players involved and although only two people ( entities ) are mentioned , there are often other " parties " affected by the decisions made by players in a game .
For example , for the nuclear testing situation , the whole world runs the risk of having radiation released into the atmosphere if something goes wrong with the underground test .
Situations of these kinds may occur only once or may be repeated often under more or less the same circumstances .
Sometimes the players may be able to communicate with each other about what actions to take , but in other situations the players interact more or less independently of each other .
Even if the players can communicate and reach agreements about how to act when playing the game , there is not always a guarantee that one or both players might not break a " treaty " that they have agreed upon .
Sometimes the players may be strangers to each other whereas in other cases they may know each other well .
When players do know each other , they might know what their respective values might be as well as the way they think about situations involved in the game .
However , even in the case of playing against a stranger , the players may be governed in their actions by their views about fairness , sympathy , and altruism .
When players interact in games of this kind , they may look at the outcomes from the play of the game in complex ways .
In some games there is money that changes hands in the game .
However , in many cases the outcomes may be measurable on several scales .
Thus , for a couple deciding which event to attend on a Friday evening , there may be monetary implications to the outcome ( movies are typically cheaper to attend than operas ) but also " satisfaction " outcomes .
Psychologists and economists , together with mathematicians , have developed theories of " utility " which attempt to allow a player of a game to assign a single number , called a utility , to the outcome that the player receives from a game ( or more generally from making some decision ) .
The main idea is that if action A is preferred to action B , then the utility assigned to A should be higher than the utility assigned to B .
However , it is well known that in expressing preference humans are not always consistent .
Thus , John might prefer apples to bananas , bananas to cherries , but cherries to apples .
Some people , when this " intransitivity " of preference is pointed out to them will " correct " their stated preferences ; other people will stand by what they have said .
This can be because there is no single underlying scale on which the fruit are being judged by this person , which means that when expressing a preference , a person is balancing complex views about the fruits .
Thus , when such " cyclic " preferences exist , it will not be possible to assign a number to each of the fruits so that one fruit is preferred to the other when the number assigned to it is higher .
This brief discussion should suggest that " utility theory " is a fascinating and complex subject .
Thus , a rich and a poor person would look at the same sum of money that might change hands in a game quite differently .
For our purposes let us pretend that the players are able to evaluate for themselves how to measure the outcomes of the game on some scale of utilities .
These outcomes of the game arise from the players making a choice among actions that are available to them .
An action on the part of each player leads to an outcome .
Sometimes the utilities associated with an outcome will be known to both of the players and sometimes they wo n't .
We will also assume that given a choice of a higher versus lower numerical payoff , both players will always select the higher payoff .
It will be convenient to refer to the two players involved in a game as Row and Column .
I will use female pronouns for Row and male pronouns for Column .
How can we record the actions available to the players of a game ?
One method is to use a " tree diagram " ( graph ) where the vertices ( sometimes called nodes ) of the tree show alternative choices for the player whose move is represented by being at this node .
In the simplest case trees are used to merely show alternative actions for the players , but they can also be used to display what information is available to the players at the times choices might be made .
Thus , a player 's opponent may or may not know what choices an opponent might have at a tree node .
When the " moves " and payoffs for a game are displayed in this form , the game is said to be described in " extensive form . "
A very simple example is displayed below ( Figure 1 ) .
In the diagram shown , the 1 - valent vertices of the tree , or leaves of the tree , are labeled with pairs ( r , c ) which indicate the payoff to row and column , respectively .
Thus , if Row plays her choice II and Column plays his choice 1 , then Row receives - $ 8 and Column receives $ 8 .
This can be interpreted to mean that Row pays Column $ 8 .
Figure 1 Figure 1
The " extensive form " of this game can be displayed more compactly , and in many respects more clearly ( though as previously noted with a loss of generality ) , if the results are displayed in " normal form . "
This is done with a matrix , showing Row 's choices in the rows of the matrix and Column 's choices in the columns of the matrix , as in Figure 2 .
The payoffs again are displayed as pairs and the Row player 's payoff is indicated first in each pair .
The way this game is played is that without communicating , the two players choose one of the two actions indicated .
For Row this means picking Row I or Row II while for column it means selecting either Column 1 or Column 2 .
You can think of each of the players as writing either I or II on a piece of paper by Row , and 1 or 2 on a piece of paper by Column , and handing their choice to a " judge . "
This person then affirms the payoff involved .
For example , if Row writes II and Column writes 1 , the judge asks Row to give Column $ 8 .
This particular game is known as a zero - sum game because the sum of the amounts that change hands with each play of the game is zero .
( Often the payoffs in a zero - sum game are displayed with only one entry in each cell of the matrix .
This number is typically the payoff to the row player .
The payoff to the column player can be deduced to be the negative of the amount that is paid to Row , whose payoff may be negative . )
Suppose that you play this game over and over again .
What this means is that you ( say you are Row ) would have to pick which of I or II to play on the first play of the game and then you would have to decide what to do on future plays of the game either based on what Column did in her previous plays of the game or independent of any behavior that Column might follow .
How would you chose to play ?
Note that the symmetry of the payoffs suggests that whatever is the best thing for Row would also be the worst thing for Column .
Also note that the sum of the row player 's entries ( in the possible outcomes ) adds to zero .
Do you think that this means that the game is " fair ? "
A fair game can be thought of as one in which the two players , assuming that each plays as well as possible ( e.g. optimal play ) , will have a net earning of zero in the long run .
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 9 , - 9 ) ( - 2 , 2 ) Row II ( - 8 , 8 ) ( 1, -1 )
Figure 2
Mixed strategies
Perhaps it is not so clear to you what would be your optimal way to play the game in Figure 2 if you were Row .
Here is a game that is perhaps simpler !
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 9 , - 9 ) ( - 2 , 2 ) Row II ( 4 , - 4 ) ( - 5 , 5 )
Figure 3
How would you play this game if you were Row ?
Notice that since 9 is bigger than 4 and - 2 is bigger than - 5 , if Row plays row I , REGARDLESS of what Column does , Row gets a higher payoff .
Thus , it would seem , in light of our discussion that more money is always preferred to less money , Row will never play Row II because she can do better by playing row I whatever Column does .
In a situation such as this we say that row I dominates row II because no matter which column the column player might select the payoff for Row in row I is better than the payoff for Row in row II .
However , if Column is a rational player he will realize that Row will never want to play row II and , thus , makes the best move consistent with that reality .
This means that Column would want to pick column 2 .
To do otherwise would be to lose on every play of the game while column 2 means that Column will win on every play .
This game is certainly not fair to Row , but rational play requires that the players do as indicated .
After all , Row easily sees that if Column plays column 2 all of the time , then playing row II rather than row I will result in a loss of 5 with each play of the game rather than a loss of 2 with each play .
These numbers can be thought of as constituting a " solution " for this game .
The analysis above was started from Row 's point of view and indicated that there was a dominating row .
We could have started the analysis from the point of view of Column .
It turns out that column II is a dominating column from Column 's point of view .
Why ever play column I when , no matter which choice Row makes , column 2 yields a higher payoff ?
From the point of view of logical reasoning , it seems reasonable to call the outcome Row 1 and Column 2 to be the " solution " to the game in the sense that rational play should result in this outcome .
( For more complicated game theory situations there may well be more than one " solution " to a game .
The reason for this is that different ways of looking at sensible or rational behavior leads to different outcomes from the different points of view . )
In playing the game in Figure 3 optimally , each player is able to chose a row and a column which results in his / her best outcome .
The fact that this is true is expressed by saying that there is a " pure " strategy ( always play a fixed row by Row and always play a fixed column by Column ) that yields optimal results .
This terminology is applied whether or not the game is played once or is played many times , and it is also true whether or not the game is zero - sum or not .
Note that situation may not always be this " clean . "
For some games there will be no optimal way to play that involves " pure " strategies .
Now consider the game which is not a zero- sum game ( Figure 4 ) .
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 2 , 1 ) ( 3 , 0 ) Row II ( 4 , - 5 ) ( 1 , 2 )
Figure 4
Suppose Row and Column have been happily playing this game for several rounds .
Row and Column both are getting positive payoffs , and although Column is not getting as much as Row , he is not unhappy with his payoff of 1 .
Now , Row notices that if Column continues to play column 1 in the next " round of play , " Row will get 4 units ( instead of 1 ) and Column will get - 5 .
Row does not really dislike Column but she reasons that he has won some money in the previous rounds and can stand some loss now without getting too angry .
So , in the next round Row plays row II and Column plays column 1 .
Needless to say Column is upset that Row changed from row I to row II but he notes that if Row is planning to assume that he is a " sucker " who will continue to play column 1 in the next round , she is not thinking clearly .
He realizes that if Row plays row II , then he will respond in the next round with column 2 .
Not only will this erase his loss but he will now earn more than Row when row I and column 1 were being played .
Furthermore , if while he moves to column 2 , Row moves to row I , he will be better off than losing 5 as is currently the situation .
Suppose Row holds steady at row II and Column moves to column 2 .
Now Row , less happy than she was when she was getting a payoff of 2 and her opponent was getting a payoff of one , decides that if Column stays with column 2 she wants to move to Row 1 .
Well you get the idea .
This game has no outcome where one of the two players might not be tempted to move to another action .
No " pure " action will lead to a " solution " for this game .
Now let us go back to the zero -sum case .
Consider the following game ( Figure 5 ) :
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 1 , - 1 ) ( - 1 , 1 ) Row II ( - 1 , 1 ) ( 1, -1 )
Figure 5
This game is symmetrical in its payoffs but it does not have any row or column that dominates any other row or column .
The sum of the entries for the four payoffs for Row and Column each add to zero .
This game is fair , that is , the long - term payoff for either player from playing this game many times would be 0 .
( To obtain this long term payoff one adds together the winnings on the individual times the game is played and divides by the number of times the game is played . )
Indeed , this is a fair game .
However , this does not mean that one can play this game in any way one might want .
Thus , suppose Row decided that to make her life easier she would play rows I and II in the fixed sequence I , I , II , I , II , II repeated over and over .
Over a period of time , an observant Column player would notice this pattern and would start playing the pattern of columns 2 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , with the result that Column would win every play of the game .
Of course , Row might catch on to the fact that she was always losing , so a clever Column who saw a deterministic pattern of play from his opponent might somewhat vary his play so that he won most of the time rather than all of the time !
The probably unexpected point here is that playing this game , say by Row , involves using a random pattern of Rows .
And not just any random pattern of rows , but a pattern where row I is used 1 / 2 of the time and row 2 is also used 1 /2 of the time .
This way of playing the game is known as the optimal mixed strategy .
" Mixed " refers to the mixture or fraction of the time Row plays each of the rows ( and similarly for Column ) .
In order to get the best return of payoffs Row must not play a deterministic pattern of the rows but must mix the percentage of time row I and row II are played in a particular way .
How does one find the optimal mixed strategies for the players in the following game ( Figure 6 ) :
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 8 , - 8 ) ( - 6 , 6 ) Row II ( - 2 , 2 ) ( 3,-3 )
Figure 6
Rather than derive the appropriate theorems from scratch , let me show a way to use one of these results to shorten the computation of the mixed strategy for a game such as this one .
Remarkably , it has been shown that for many zero - sum 2 - person games such as that in the example below , when either of the players , say Row , is playing his / her optimal mixed strategy with a resulting long run payoff P , it makes no difference what pattern of play is used by the other player ; the payoff to the other player will be - P .
Note that when Row is playing optimally , there is no guarantee that Row 's optimal long run payoff will be positive .
Using this theorem , we can compute the optimal mixed way each player should play the game ( Figure 6 ) .
Suppose , for example , that we use p to represent the fraction of the time that Row should play row I to achieve her maximum payoff .
Then it follows that she should play row II 1 - p of the time .
Since the payoff to Row in this case will be the same whatever Column does , let us first compute the payoff to Row when Column plays column 1 all of the time .
Since Row plays row I a fraction p of the time , the " expected " long run payoff for this would by 8 p and since Row plays row II 1 - p of the time , the expected payoff for this would be - 2 ( 1 - p ) .
In the long run the payoff from this pattern play would be : 8 p - 2 ( 1 - p ) .
Using a similar calculation when Column plays column 2 all of the time we get - 6 ( p ) + 3 ( 1 - p ) .
Hence , to find the optimal value of p we must solve the linear equation below for p :
It is easily seen that q , the fraction of the time that Column should play column 1 is 9/19 , though it is worth making this calculation and solving the resulting linear equation to practice how the thinking goes .
To find out who has an advantage , one can substitute the value p=5/19 into the left or right hand side of the equation above .
One sees that Row 's payoff is 12/19 and , thus , Column 's payoff is - 12/19 .
This is not such an easy number to see without the mathematics !
Thus , if this game is repeated 19 times the payoff to Row will be approximately $ 12 .
Each time the game is played $ 8 , $ 6 , $ 3 or $ 2 changes hands but on the average , over a long number of plays of this game , Row will win 12/19 of a dollar on each play of the game and Column will lose 12/19 of a dollar on each play .
A famous theorem of von Neumann in essence shows that for a two - player zero - sum game where Row has m choices and Column has n choices , each time the game is played that game has an optimal mixed strategy for each player .
This optimal strategy has the property that if either player deviates from the mixed strategy which is best for him / her , then that player will only do worse .
Nash Equilibria
However , many of the most interesting games that mathematicians and those who try to apply game theory in the real world have to analyze are not zero - sum games .
For example the game below might be a model of the situation described earlier in which a couple is trying to decide whether to go to a movie or to the opera .
Column 1 ( Opera ) Column 2 ( Movie ) Row I ( Opera ) ( 6 , 2 ) ( 4 , 4 ) Row II ( Movie ) ( 7 , 4 ) ( 10 , 3 )
Figure 7
Using dominating strategy analysis this game has the " solution " of Row playing row II and Column playing column 1 , using pure strategies .
However , other nonzero - sum games , such as the one we saw in Figure 4 , do not have a solution in pure strategies .
Remarkably , it has been shown that if one moves to the domain of " mixed strategies " there will always be an " equilibrium " solution for Row and Column - that there will always be a " Nash Equilibrium . "
The concept is named for John Nash , who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his seminal work in showing the existence of the " equilibria " that now bear his name .
Nash 's Theorem is an existence theorem .
He uses mathematics , the Kakutani fixed point theorem , to show that equilibria exist for certain games but does not show how to find them .
In fact , the issue of determining the number and computational complexity of finding Nash Equilibria for games is still a wide open area of research .
The basic idea behind the concept of a Nash Equilibrium is that for wide classes of games there are ways for the players to play the game , sometimes as pure strategies and sometimes as mixed strategies so that if a player deviates from the Nash Equilibrium strategy , he / she can not improve his / her payoff .
Our more detailed analysis of the two - person zero - sum games with two action choices for each player gives the spirit of what is involved .
Fictitious Play
For those with mathematical skill one can master the techniques for finding the optimal play of games such as the ones we have been looking at .
It would be nice , however , if there was a more pragmatic approach to playing a game such as the one we solved ( Figure 6 ) .
An insight into this was obtained by the mathematician Julia Robinson ( 1918 - 1985 ) , who is much better known for her famous role in the solution of Hilbert 's 10th Problem .
Robinson was also the first woman President of the American Mathemtical Society .
She proved an intriguing result based on an idea pioneered by the Princeton educated mathematician George William Brown .
Brown introduced the idea of " fictitious play , " though the terminology is not particularly felicitous because it is a technique that often can be used in practice to play games .
Suppose you are asked to play a zero - sum game with no dominating rows or columns such as the one in Figure 6 .
You could , if you have mastered how , do the calculations we did to find the optimal way to play .
However , another approach might be to see if there was some " adaptive " way to play the game .
Intuitively , the idea is to learn from playing the game to be able to play the game better .
Start by making what you hope is a good first move , look at the payoff you receive based on your opponent 's choice and then move in the future in a way to try to " improve " ( or not make worse ) your situation .
What Julia Robinson showed is that for 2 - person zero -sum games this " learning as you go along " approach to games works .
In the end , if each player adopts this point of view they will eventually converge to their optimal mixed strategies .
Unfortunately , as shown by Lloyd Shapley this is not true for all games .
Shapley provided an example of a 3x3 game for which the adaptive learning approach does not work .
Robinson 's work and extensions of it have important connections to the area of mathematics known as dynamical systems .
Robinson 's work has been extended in a variety of ways .
Other works have been showing connections between ideas involving adaptive approaches to playing games and learning environments in general .
Other researchers are showing exciting connections to ideas in evolutionary biology , where game theory is having exciting implications .
Prisoner 's Dilemma
Perhaps the most famous of all games is Prisoner 's Dilemma .
It deserves ( and perhaps will eventually get ) a column of its own .
The game takes its name from a " story " to accompany the matrix of the game , that is due to Albert W. Tucker , who for many years headed the Mathematics Department at Princeton University .
The story helps explain the payoffs of a 2 - person nonzero - sum game with a structure that has " paradoxical " implications .
( Albert W. Tucker , courtesy of his son Alan Tucker ) ( Albert W. Tucker , courtesy of his son Alan Tucker )
The game below belongs to the Prisoner 's Dilemma type of game .
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 3 , 3 ) ( 0 , 5 ) Row II ( 5 , 0 ) ( 1 , 1 )
Figure 8
If one carries out a dominating strategy analysis of this game , one sees that the players should play row II and column 2 to achieve their " best " outcome .
However , the payoff of 1 to each of Row and Column is poorer than the payoff of 3 to each of them for playing row I and column 1 .
This creates the paradoxical situation that rational play leads to a poorer outcome than irrational play .
The situation is even more dramatic when the outcomes become negative :
Column 1 Column 2 Row I ( 8 , 8 ) ( - 6 , 20 ) Row II ( 20 , - 6 ) ( - 4, -4 )
Figure 9
Game theory suggests that the " rational " way to play this game is to play row II and column 2 either when the game is played once , or when there is repeated play of this game .
Yet , this seems difficult to accept if there is an outcome where on each play , instead of losing 4 units , the players can each gain 8 units .
However , the game theory analysis shows that playing row I and column 1 is not " stable . "
Players playing this way in repeated plays of this game will always be tempted by the fact that if their opponent does not shift action simultaneously , then they can improve their own payoff while " hurting " their opponent .
Thus , if Column continues to play column 1 while Row moves from row I to row II , the result will be that Row earns 20 instead of 8 , while Column goes from winning 8 to losing 6 .
Not that this is true even though Row and Column may have signed a " binding treaty . "
Unfortunately , Prisoner 's Dilemma is not merely an intellectual curiosity .
It seems like a reasonable model for various confrontational games such as those that occur between unions and management during contract negotiations , and in the relationship between countries .
In fact , the US Defense Department did research into the ways games such as Prisoner 's Dilemma were played by " real people " in an attempt to understand the implications of " cold war " politics during the time of the Soviet Union .
The Centipede Game
Compared with Prisoner 's Dilemma the centipede game is not that well known , but like Prisoner 's Dilemma , it has been a very fertile window into gaining insight into the nature of rationality .
The discrepancy between the predictions that game theory makes for the way to play the centipede game and what happens in actual practice has created a torrent of research .
The centipede game , again like Prisoner 's Dilemma is actually a family of games with similar characteristics but in which the specific game variant depends on a collection of numerical parameters .
Experiments using different parameters yield different results and insights into the family .
This game was developed by Robert W. Rosenthal , a mathematically trained economist .
However , the name for the game is due to Kenneth Binmore .
( Courtesy of Professor Randall Ellis , Dept. of Economics , Boston University ) ( Courtesy of Professor Randall Ellis , Dept. of Economics , Boston University )
Sadly , Rosenthal died of a heart attack in 2002 at the relatively young age of 57 .
His research ranged over a variety of aspects of the interplay of game theory and economics .
His work often returned to the issue of what constituted sensible or rational behavior in economic settings .
The basic idea of the centipede game involves alternating moves of two players in a game which is described in " extensive form " by a tree .
In looking at the current move that a player has versus the move that his / her opponent can next make , the player sees that the current pot of outcomes gives her more income than her opponent , but on the next move the reverse will be true .
A generic version of the game is shown below .
The two players ' names are A and B and at a given vertex ( white circle ) of the " decision tree " the names of the players alternate .
At a particular dot , say one labeled A , which is where player A must make a decision , there are two moves that A can make .
A can move either to the right ( go to the next vertex to the right ) where A cedes to B the decision about what to do next , or A can terminate the game by going down .
Going to the right in the literature of the centipede game is often described as " pass , " which means the player currently to move does not terminate the game ( except for the very last decision ) , while the decision to go down is described as " take . "
The two numbers at the end of the down arrow are the payoffs to A ( on the left ) and B ( on the right ) .
The down ( take ) moves are indicated in blue to contrast them with the right ( pass ) moves .
Usually , the game is assumed to have equal numbers of decision moves for A and for B .
( This means there is an odd number of 1 - valent vertices or leaves in the tree . )
Figure 10
The game gets its name from the diagram above where there is a resemblance to a critter with many legs .
However , consider the small version of the centipede game which is shown in Figure 11 in order to see the troublesome aspects of this game for theorists .
Figure 11
Suppose you are A .
How would you play this game ?
Here is the mathematical reasoning that comes with treating this game as one of perfect information , where both players are completely rational each opponent behaves rationally .
Suppose the game were to reach the stage where player B has to act at the far right decision vertex .
Now B , preferring more money rather than less will choose take ( down ) at this node .
This follows since if B passes , he gets 16 while his opponent A gets 64 .
By " taking , " B gets 32 while A only gets 8 .
Thus , at the prior vertex , A knowing what B will do , will chose to pick take ( down ) .
Knowing this , " backward reasoning " means that at the prior node B will take , which in turn means that at the very first decision node , A should take as well !
Reasoning of this kind has come to be called " backward induction . "
Similarly , in the " long " ( e.g. many feet ) version of the centipede game it means that A should choose the take ( down ) option on the very first play of the game .
This means that both players receive relatively meager payoffs .
To play longer offers each of the players a chance to make more but only at the risk that when the game is stopped , his / her opponent will walk away with more than he / she will .
In this variant of the game the amounts each player gets are going up quickly ; however , in some variants , the growth is very slow .
Furthermore , in some variants the initial pot , if taken , gives each equal amounts .
One can look at a version of the game where the sum of the payoffs to the players is a constant .
The characteristic of these games is that rational play suggests that the first player should take right at the start .
Yet , this seems a perplexing choice since so much more can be gained by being " irrational . "
Also , note that if A passes ( allows B to move ) at the first node of the game , then B faces a new version of the centipede game with essentially the same structure that A had !
Why might you not take at the first opportunity if you are player A ?
One reason is that you might have some " altruistic " component to your personality .
You might also think that perhaps your opponent , if the centipede is longer ( rather than having 4 legs ) , will make a mistake in the analysis and continue to play longer when it is his / her decision .
The situation gets interesting if one takes this game and sees what happens when real people ( rather than armchair philosophers , mathematicians and game theorists ) play the game !
Experimental economists and other scholars have actually done this .
Nearly always , real people , who have been clearly explained the rules of the game and understand them , do not terminate the game at the first move !
Does this mean that the analysis of the game that we have given is wrong or does it mean that human beings are " irrational " ?
Are you surprised that many people do not play this game " rationally " in the sense that when given the chance to play A at the first round , they do not choose " take " ?
On the other hand it is also the case that the game does not typically last as long as allowing B to make the pass move at the last vertex .
Variants of the centipede game have provided a controlled environment to probe the nature of altruism , signaling to achieve cooperation , and the limits to rationality .
These experiments have worked with the centipede game in extensive form as well as in recent work that gets new insights from using a normal form for the centipede game .
In this work the subjects of the experiments must name the " round " where they would " take " in the centipede game rather than play the game dynamically as such .
An interesting recent set of experiments concerns playing the centipede game where groups of players compete in the game against each other rather than individuals playing each other .
The results here suggest that groups come closer to the prediction of " taking " on the first round of play than when individuals play .
The accelerating number of papers of both a theoretical type and experimental type that draw inspiration from the centipede game are a testament to the fertility of a single game and its associated circle of ideas to stimulate mathematicians and scholars over a wide array of disciplines .

The proposed burqa ban comes ahead of Dutch elections
The burqa , a full body covering that also obscures the face , would be banned by law in the street , and in trains , schools , buses and the law courts .
The cabinet said burqas disturb public order , citizens and safety .
The decision comes days ahead of elections which the ruling centre - right coalition is expected to win .
Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk , who is known for her tough policies , said it was important that all people in the Netherlands were able to see and identify each other clearly to promote integration and tolerance .
Last year a majority of MPs in the Dutch parliament said they were in favour of a ban .
An estimated 6 % of 16 million people living in the Netherlands are Muslims .
But there are thought to be fewer than 100 women who choose to wear the burqa , a traditional Islamic form of dress .
Civil rights debate
The latest move came after an expert committee judged that it would not contravene Dutch law .
Other forms of face coverings , such as crash helmets with visors that obscure the face , would also be covered by a legal ban .
Ms Verdonk insisted the burqa was not an acceptable part of public life in the Netherlands .
" The Cabinet finds it undesirable that face - covering clothing - including the burqa - is worn in public places for reasons of public order , security and protection of citizens , " she said .
Critics of the proposed ban say it would violate civil rights .
The main Muslim organisation in the Netherlands , CMO , said the plan was an " over- reaction to a very marginal problem " , the Associated Press reported .
But the minister told the BBC that social interaction would be easier if faces were not covered .
" It is very important that we can see each other and can communicate with each other .
Because we are so tolerant we want to respect each other . "
Tension
The issue of the type of clothing worn by Muslim women has become a hotly - debated subject in a range of European countries .
France has passed a law banning religious symbols , including Muslim headscarves , from schools .
Find out about different styles of Muslim headscarf
In graphics
Italy has banned face - coverings , resurrecting old laws passed to combat domestic terrorism , while citing new security fears .
The issue of Muslim women 's dress also surfaced in the UK , where former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said women should not wear the veil .
The Dutch relationship with its Muslim community has been under scrutiny since the murder of film - maker Theo van Gogh by Islamic extremists in November 2004 .
Earlier this year Ms Verdonk clashed with a minority party in the governing coalition over her handling of the citizenship case of Somali- born Dutch MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
The MP scripted a controversial film about the treatment of women in Islamic society , directed by van Gogh before he was killed .
But she admitted lying on her 1992 application for Dutch citizenship , and Ms Verdonk initially called for the MP to be deported .
Drug campaigners have warned that a batch of cannabis adulterated with tiny glass beads which they say could pose a risk to health has flooded the UK market .
Anecdotal reports suggest it is being sold in almost every part of the country .
The charity Drugscope is issuing a warning .
" We want to make people aware of it from a public health point of view .
If you are smoking this stuff and taking it into your lungs it 's not good news . "
The fact that " grit weed " , as it is being called , is so widespread suggests that contamination is happening at an early stage in the production process .
" It seems to be being done on an industrial scale , " said Harry Shapiro of Drugscope .
The dealers ' motivation seems to be to bump up the weight of their product .
They appear to be doing this by spraying plants with the reflective element from the paint used on road lines .
The tiny reflective glass beads become imbedded in the leaves .
" It looks perfectly normal .
In fact it looks good quality , " said Derek Williams of UK Cannabis Internet Activists , which campaigns against cannabis prohibition .
Contributors to its internet forum have said the contaminated leaves can be identified by rubbing them between wetted fingers .
The residue will feel gritty if chewed .
The first reports of grit weed circulated in late summer , but the groups have only recently received pictures of the beads taken with an electron microscope by an anonymous scientist .
There have been rumours of users experiencing a tight chest for days after smoking grit weed , but a spokesperson for the British Thoracic Society said that the contamination was unlikely to be dangerous because the particles are too big to be inhaled into the lungs .
An analysis carried out by the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction found that the glass particles are between 0.02 and 0.3 millimetres across .
But Richard Russell , a consultant at Imperial College London , said few particles above 0.015 millimetres would be able to pass into the lungs because they are too big .
" It is likely that they will deposit in the mouth or the throat , " said Dr Russell .
Here they would most likely pass harmlessly through the system .
Using a filter would stop them entering the mouth .
Dr Russell said that smokers should be aware that cannabis smoke causes emphysema , lung inflammation and cancer .
" You are likely to do more damage from the marijuana than these particles . "
Mr Williams said that the widespread contamination highlighted the problems which stem from cannabis prohibition .
" Cannabis is called a controlled drug , but there is no control over the supply side .
It 's a completely underground product , " he said .
Does Secrecy Help Protect Personal Information ?
Personal information protection is an economic problem , not a security problem .
And the problem can be easily explained :
The organizations we trust to protect our personal information do not suffer when information gets exposed .
On the other hand , individuals who suffer when personal information is exposed do nât have the capability to protect that information .
There are actually two problems here : Personal information is easy to steal , and it âs valuable once stolen .
We ca nât solve one problem without solving the other .
The solutions are nât easy , and you âre not going to like them .
First , fix the economic problem .
Credit card companies make more money extending easy credit and making it trivial for customers to use their cards than they lose from fraud .
They wo nât improve their security as long as you ( and not they ) are the one who suffers from identity theft .
It âs the same for banks and brokerages :
As long as you âre the one who suffers when your account is hacked , they do nât have any incentive to fix the problem .
And data brokers like ChoicePoint are worse ; they do nât suffer if they reveal your information .
You do nât have a business relationship with them ; you ca nât even switch to a competitor in disgust .
Credit card security works as well as it does because the 1968 Truth in Lending Law limits consumer liability for fraud to $ 50 .
If the credit card companies could pass fraud losses on to the consumers , they would be spending far less money to stop those losses .
But once Congress forced them to suffer the costs of fraud , they invented all sorts of security measuresâreal - time transaction verification , expert systems patrolling the transaction database and so on âto prevent fraud .
The lesson is clear :
Make the party in the best position to mitigate the risk responsible for the risk .
What this will do is enable the capitalist innovation engine .
Once it âs in the financial interest of financial institutions to protect us from identity theft , they will .
Second , stop using personal information to authenticate people .
Watch how credit cards work .
Notice that the store clerk barely looks at your signature , or how you can use credit cards remotely where no one can check your signature .
The credit card industry learned decades ago that authenticating people has only limited value .
Instead , they put most of their effort into authenticating the transaction , and they âre much more secure because of it .
This wo nât solve the problem of securing our personal information , but it will greatly reduce the threat .
Once the information is no longer of value , you only have to worry about securing the information from voyeurs rather than the more commonâand more financially motivated âfraudsters .
And third , fix the other economic problem : Organizations that expose our personal information are nât hurt by that exposure .
We need a comprehensive privacy law that gives individuals ownership of their personal information and allows them to take action against organizations that do nât care for it properly .
â Passwords â like credit card numbers and mother âs maiden name used to work , but we âve forever left the world where our privacy comes from the obscurity of our personal information and the difficulty others have in accessing it .
We need to abandon security systems that are based on obscurity and difficulty , and build legal protections to take over where technological advances have left us exposed .

A few minutes minutes later I noticed her walk back the other way .
The sushi was gone , but this time she stopped in front of a different garbage can opposite my table and bent forward so that her face was halfway into the opening .
This time , instead of walking away she opened the front door of the wooden stand that housed the garbage can , tilted the can towards her with one hand , and then reached in with the other hand so that her entire body up to her neck vanished for a moment behind the black plastic liner .
When she reappeared seconds later , she had a half - eaten chicken leg in her fingers , which she brought close to her eyes for inspection while simultaneously tilting the garbage can back into place and closing the front door of the wooden stand .
Leaning against the opening of the wooden stand , she placed the chicken leg on a plastic carry - out tray that she retrieved from the top of her pull - cart , quickly turning the leg from side to side a few times .
Then she lifted it up to her nose , then closely stared at the spots that bore the marks of what looked like a single , quick bite from original owner .
And before the situation quite registered , before I had a sense of how intently I was staring at this elderly woman , she jerked the chicken leg to her mouth , pulled it back , looked closely again , then placed it on her tray and disappeared around the corner .
I did not see her again .
Besides the fact that she was eating garbage , the woman looked " ordinary . "
I live in an area with a high density of elderly women and this particular woman appeared no different than most .
It was a cold night and she was dressed warmly .
Her pull - cart was half filled with what appeared to be groceries .
She had a scarf and eyeglasses .
Her hands looked clear , her hair was combed .
What was most startling was how normal she looked and the horrifying scenario her normal appearance raised in my mind .
It seemed she was not a homeless person eating from garbage cans to alleviate hunger , but an elderly woman working a strategy to extend her monthly budget .
America 's Dirty Secret : Elderly Poor Women
At the end of the Clinton Administration , the White House commissioned a study looking into the retirement security of women in America .
It is a startling study for anyone interested in the related questions of poverty and aging in the United States .
Some key findings from that study ( full PDF of report ) :
Women Have Lower Income in Retirement than Men -- And Thus Higher Poverty .
In 1997 , median income for elderly unmarried women ( widowed , divorced , separated , and never married ) was $ 11,161 , compared with $ 14,769 for elderly unmarried men and $ 29,278 for elderly married couples .
Thus , the poverty rate for elderly women was higher than that of men : in 1997 , the poverty rate of elderly women was 13.1 percent , compared to 7.0 percent among men .
Among unmarried elderly women , the poverty rate was significantly higher -- about 19 percent .

Social Security Is Particularly Important to Women .
Elderly unmarried women -- including widows -- get 51 percent of their total income from Social Security .
Unmarried elderly men get 39 percent , while elderly married couples get 36 percent of their income from Social Security .
For 25 percent of unmarried women , Social Security is their only source of income , compared to 9 percent of married couples and 20 percent of unmarried men .
Without Social Security benefits , the elderly poverty rate among women would have been 52.2 percent and among widows would have been 60.6 percent .

Women Face Greater Economic Challenges in Retirement .
First , women tend to live longer : a woman who is 65 years old today can expect to live to 85 , while a 65 year old man can expect to live to 81 .
Second , women have lower lifetime earnings than men do .
And third , women reach retirement with smaller pensions and other assets than men do .
In other words , the problem of old - age poverty in the United States is disproportionately a problem facing women .
Thus , Social Security and its complex layering of benefits is disproportionately a system that American women draw upon to avoid slipping into debilitating levels of poverty .
Of all the statistics in this report , this is perhaps the most astounding :
Women make up nearly three quarters -- 72 percent -- of the increasing number of Americans over 85 years old : Because women live longer , on average , than men , women make up 72 percent of all beneficiaries age 85 and above .
This general statistic gets even more dramatic as the population ages , such that by the time the population approaches the late 80s , we see that a vast majority of Social Security recipients are women :
The logical extension of this situation as discovered by the working group that commissioned the study : without Social Security , the number of elderly women living below the poverty line would spike to more than 50 percent :
Why this report came into existence in the first place is just as interesting as the findings itself as it opens onto the broader discussion raised by the sight of elderly women eating out of garbage cans in America .
A Nation Once Concerned With the Well - Being of Women
In 1995 the United Nations convened the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing , China .
One of the key action items agreed upon at the conference was a decision to promote gender mainstreaming .
Simply put , " gender mainstreaming " is a process of studying the impact that any given policy will have on women as compared to men .
In anticipation of this recommendation by the conference , President Clinton established what he called the " President 's Interagency Council on Women " ( archive here ) headed by then Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala .
The Council was charged with the task of applying the Beijing World Conference Action Agenda to the United States .
The very first strategic objective of that Action Agenda -- action item " A.1 " -- and hence the very top priority of President Clinton 's Interagency Council on Women - - was women and poverty .
It is worth reading the first part of item A.1 from 1995 -- the actions recommended for governments -- not merely for the progressive agenda it lays out for eradicating the social problem of poverty amongst women , but to get a sense of how much the United States has abandoned this agenda in the past six years [ emphasis mine ] :
Review and modify , with the full and equal participation of women , macroeconomic and social policies with a view to achieving the objectives of the Platform for Action ; Analyze , from a gender perspective , policies and programmes - including those related to macroeconomic stability , structural adjustment , external debt problems , taxation , investments , employment , markets and all relevant sectors of the economy - with respect to their impact on poverty , on inequality and particularly on women ; assess their impact on family well - being and conditions and adjust them , as appropriate , to promote more equitable distribution of productive assets , wealth , opportunities , income and services ; Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies that are designed and monitored with the full and equal participation of women , encourage broad - based sustained economic growth , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender - based inequality within the overall framework of achieving people - centred sustainable development ; Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; Develop agricultural and fishing sectors , where and as necessary , in order to ensure , as appropriate , household and national food security and food self - sufficiency , by allocating the necessary financial , technical and human resources ;
Develop policies and programmes to promote equitable distribution of food within the household ; Provide adequate safety nets and strengthen State - based and community - based support systems , as an integral part of social policy , in order to enable women living in poverty to withstand adverse economic environments and preserve their livelihood , assets and revenues in times of crisis ; Generate economic policies that have a positive impact on the employment and income of women workers in both the formal and informal sectors and adopt specific measures to address women 's unemployment , in particular their long - term unemployment ; Formulate and implement , when necessary , specific economic , social , agricultural and related policies in support of female - headed households ; Develop and implement anti-poverty programmes , including employment schemes , that improve access to food for women living in poverty , including through the use of appropriate pricing and distribution mechanisms ;
Ensure the full realization of the human rights of all women migrants , including women migrant workers , and their protection against violence and exploitation ; introduce measures for the empowerment of documented women migrants , including women migrant workers ; facilitate the productive employment of documented migrant women through greater recognition of their skills , foreign education and credentials , and facilitate their full integration into the labour force ;
Introduce measures to integrate or reintegrate women living in poverty and socially marginalized women into productive employment and the economic mainstream ; ensure that internally displaced women have full access to economic opportunities and that the qualifications and skills of immigrant and refugee women are recognized ;
Enable women to obtain affordable housing and access to land by , among other things , removing all obstacles to access , with special emphasis on meeting the needs of women , especially those living in poverty and female heads of household ; Formulate and implement policies and programmes that enhance the access of women agricultural and fisheries producers ( including subsistence farmers and producers , especially in rural areas ) to financial , technical , extension and marketing services ; provide access to and control of land , appropriate infrastructure and technology in order to increase women 's incomes and promote household food security , especially in rural areas and , where appropriate , encourage the development of producer - owned , market - based cooperatives ; Create social security systems wherever they do not exist , or review them with a view to placing individual women and men on an equal footing , at every stage of their lives ;
Ensure access to free or low - cost legal services , including legal literacy , especially designed to reach women living in poverty ;
Take particular measures to promote and strengthen policies and programmes for indigenous women with their full participation and respect for their cultural diversity , so that they have opportunities and the possibility of choice in the development process in order to eradicate the poverty that affects them .
These recommendations painted quite a startling picture of a world where women still face such basic problems as equal access to food within their own homes .
But they also pointed to the importance of social security systems as a key factor in maintaining equality for women throughout their lives .
The Interagency Council , thus , led to the report and the statistics cited above .
Bush Dismantles the Gender Mainstreaming Put in Place by Clinton
It should come as no shock to anyone that President Bush not only abandoned these initiatives against women 's poverty , but he actually disbanded the agencies set up by Clinton .
As reported in 2004 by Deborah Zabarenko on Reuters , not only did the Bush administration eliminate the Interagency Council on Women , he actually deleted from government web sites many of the resources created by the past initiatives :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The Bush administration has stripped information on a range of women 's issues from government Web sites , apparently in pursuit of a political agenda , researchers reported on Wednesday [...]
At the Labor Department 's Women 's Bureau Web site , the report said 25 key publications on subjects ranging from pay equity to child care to issues relating to black and Latina women and women business owners had been deleted with no explanation .
Key government offices dedicated to addressing the needs of women have been disbanded [...]
These include the Office of Women 's Initiatives and Outreach in the White House and the President 's Interagency Council on Women .
At the Pentagon , the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services was slated to be dismantled but was saved after an outcry .
However , the report said this committee now focused on issues such as health care for servicewomen and the effects of deployment on families , but not on equity and access issues .
In the area of scientific objectivity , the report said two advisory committees recommended the Food and Drug Administration approve a contraceptive known as Plan B as a nonprescription drug but were blocked by political pressure from doing so .
Regarding violence against women , the report said the U.S. attorney general , as of March 2004 , had failed to conduct and publish a study required under the 2000 Violence Against Women
Act to investigate discrimination against domestic violence victims in getting insurance .
One way to interpret Bush 's purging of information and disbanding of agencies is to place it in the wider context of Bush 's efforts to strip the federal government of anything that even vaguely resembled women 's equal rights vis -Ã  - vis abortion .
Many of these reports seemed to be thrown out with the anti-abortion bathwater that Bush tossed into the street in his first term .
But the other context was a radical policy priority that Bush introduced into his policies .
From the moment he took office , Bush turned government into an instrument that blocked advances in gender equality , racial equality and economic equality , while at the same time reinventing government as an advocate for " faith - based " or religious organizations .
Where Clinton established an interagency on gender mainstreaming , Bush established a White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives ( January 29 , 2001 ) .
Interestingly , the responsibilities charged to Bush 's Faith - Based office have similar elements to those addressed by Clinton 's Interagency on Women , albeit with drastically different implications :
Section 1 . Policy .
Faith - based and other community organizations are indispensable in meeting the needs of poor Americans and distressed neighborhoods .
Government cannot be replaced by such organizations , but it can and should welcome them as partners .
The paramount goal is compassionate results , and private and charitable community groups , including religious ones , should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field , so long as they achieve valid public purposes , such as curbing crime , conquering addiction , strengthening families and neighborhoods , and overcoming poverty .
This delivery of social services must be results oriented and should value the bedrock principles of pluralism , nondiscrimination , evenhandedness , and neutrality .
Whereas the Clinton administration was concerned with understanding and ending such social problems as women 's access to resources and opportunity -- ending women 's poverty -- the Bush administration was concerned that religious institutions have equal access to government funding .
The Bush administration became an advocate for the rights of faith - based organizations , while at the same time it charged ahead with plans to dismantle Social Security -- the very system that was found to be the greatest barrier to poverty amongst elderly women .
Eating Garbage
The federal government cannot by itself guarantee the end of poverty for any group in society .
But it should anger every American to learn that our government was in the process of identifying and addressing what will be the key poverty demographic for the next 50 years : elderly women .
It would be too simplistic to say that when President Bush disbanded the Interagency Council on Women he set in motion a set of social policies that led to elderly women eating out of garbage cans .
That would be too simplistic .
But it is worth seeing how this horrific site leads us back to the great strides at dealing with women 's poverty that our country was making before it was hijacked by the violent authoritarian policies of President Bush .
And this brings us to the most frustrating aspect of this story :
What happened to the poor women at the opening of my story ?
Unfortunately , she vanished before I had a chance to find her .
No doubt , her strategy for feeding out of garbage cans also involved moving from spot to spot so as not to be caught by employees of the cafe .
As an individual -- one person -- I was unable to do anything directly to remedy her situation .
Yet , the great purpose of government is specifically to help people in these situations -- to act in a way that individuals cannot act .
What shameful chapter in American history this has become .
A chapter where our government tosses our soldiers like garbage into a war they cannot win , then leave them neglected in hospitals filled with rats .
A chapter where our government leaves people to drown in their homes and then blames them for not being prepared for a hurricane .
A chapter where our government destroys all evidence of advocating for women , and becomes numb to the problem of elderly women feeding out of garbage cans .

PARIS , May 7 â Violent protests against the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France ended early today with hundreds of people arrested , hundreds of cars gutted and hundreds of windows smashed in several cities across in France .
Some people fear the reaction is just a taste of what is likely to come if Mr. Sarkozy makes good on his campaign promises to push through controversial economic legislation during his first 100 days in office .
Agence France - Presse , citing national police headquarters , reported that 730 cars had been set afire overnight , 35 in Paris , and that 592 people had been arrested , 79 in the capital .
It said 78 police officers had been injured .
Some of the most concentrated violence took place at Place de la Bastille in Paris where the police fired volley after volley of teargas cluster grenades that looked like fireworks before descending on the crowd of young protesters .
At one point , the square â the site of the July 14 , 1789 , uprising that is celebrated annually â was thick with white teargas reflecting the orange glow of a car fire while silhouetted youths heaved paving stones at tight formations of armored riot police officers .
Ten of the Biggest Mistakes Developers Make With Databases
Although fashions come and go in software development , some things stay remarkably constant .
One of these is the use of databases .
You may be wonderfully up - to - date with an AJAX Web interface or the latest whizbang Windows user interface , but under the covers , you 're probably still pumping data in and out of a database , just as we all did a decade or more ago .
That makes it all the more surprising that developers are still making the same database mistakes that date back to those good old days of Windows 95 and before .
Perhaps it 's just that most of us learn to use databases on the side , rather than really studying them .
In any case , here are my nominations for the biggest mistakes that I see over and over again .
Choosing the Wrong Database
Not all databases are created equal â which means before you do anything with a database , you have to pick the appropriate database .
Time and again I 've seen Access databases groaning to bear the load of huge data sets that would have been child 's play for SQL Server , or harried users trying to pay for and set up SQL Server to hold a few hundred rows of data .
Broadly speaking , there are three tiers of databases in the market these days : desktop and embedded databases suitable for smaller tasks , " Express " versions of the major players that are good up to a few gigabytes of data , and the truly enterprise databases like SQL Server , Oracle , and DB2 that can handle just about anything you can throw at them .
Before you do anything else , you need to make some realistic estimates about the amount of data that you 'll be storing and pick the appropriate product to do the storage .
Choosing Too Many Databases
APIs such as ODBC , JDBC , and OLE DB have promoted the notion of database independence - the idea that you can write your application code in such a manner that you can plug any database at all in for data storage .
Well , yes , but there are compromises .
I 've seen a lot of teams go down the rat hole of database independence , writing layers to translate all of their SQL statements to some lowest common denominator dialect that every conceivable database will support , and at the same time giving up on advanced features available in any particular database .
The notion seems to be that some client in the future might want to switch to Oracle or DB2 or Fox Pro or whatever , so it 's best to be prepared now .
On the contrary : when you 're starting out with a new product , pick your storage engine and write to it .
If your product is good , people will install the database you specify , and you wo n't be wasting untold man-hours supporting " just in case " scenarios that you 'll probably never need .
Know Your Data
If I had a dollar for every time it turned out that some customer numbers had seven digits instead of six , or that the registrar 's office really did allow students to register without a social security number due to privacy concerns and so the column has to be made nullable - well , I 'd have a lot of dollars .
Database design can't be done in a vacuum , away from the business rules .
It 's critical that you get the input of the actual users of the data , and hammer on them to find out for sure how big each column needs to be , what rules apply to it , what types of data it will hold , who can update it , and so on .
Otherwise , you 're setting yourself up for costly rework down the line .
You 'll learn to dread sentences starting with " Well , it looks fine , except ... "
It 's Just Like Excel , Right ?
There 's a tendency , especially among managers of smaller shops , to assume that any developer knows how to set up a database .
Frankly , this perplexes me .
You would n't assume that any given developer knows how to code in C # or set up a Web Service , so why is it that we 're all supposed to be database pros ?
The end result is that too many databases are designed by people who have never even heard the term normalization , never mind developed any understanding of the various normal forms .
I can't tell you how many times I 've found everything shoved into one big table with hideous update anomalies and performance issues as a result .
If you 're in this situation yourself , and you 're over your head , demand training - or start job - hunting .
Efficient database design is something you need to learn , not discover by trial and error .
Third Normal Form is Not the Holy Grail
On the other hand , a little knowledge really can be a dangerous thing .
I 've seen databases that were normalized to death by well - meaning developers who insisted on putting everything in lookup tables .
I recall one memorable instance in which " yes " and " no " were relegated to tblAnswers , where they could be referred to by an AnswerID foreign key from other tables .
Yes , you need to know the normalization rules , but you also need to develop the skill to know when to stop normalizing , and when denormalization for performance actually makes sense .

When Victoria Simmonds gave birth at only 23 weeks , her son Kaven weighed just over 1lb and doctors put his chances of survival at nil .
He was so fragile that his ribs broke with the effort of breathing , and both of his legs fractured as his nappy was changed .
As he hung on to life he suffered a flesh - eating bug inside his stomach , and he underwent a gruelling six operations and 50 blood transfusions .
Scroll down for more ...
But after six months in hospital , Kaven - one the most premature babies ever born in the UK - was finally allowed to go home .
And yesterday his mother told of the moment she became convinced he would survive .
" When he put his tiny hand on to mine , I knew he was going to be all right , " said Miss Simmonds , 25 , a civil servant from Cardiff .
" He is such a little fighter . "
It was in May last year that Miss Simmonds went into labour .
Doctors could not halt it and frantically administered steroid injections to try to develop the baby 's lungs .
" I prayed that he would hang on , " said Miss Simmonds .
Kaven - the name means " handsome " in Gaelic - was born within minutes of his mother 's admission to Heath Hospital , Cardiff , and doctors did not think he would last through the night .
At five days old , he was diagnosed with the flesh - eating bug Necrotising - Fasciitis and needed emergency surgery to remove part of his bowel .
" We were so frightened for him , " added his mother , whose 25 - year old partner Lawrence Gainey is an IT project manager .
" We had him baptised before the operation , as the doctors did n't think he would be coming back .
We just had to sit and pray that he would hang on . "
The operation took nearly three hours but Kaven 's battle still was n't over .
Scans revealed his ribs and legs were broken .
Miss Simmonds said : " He was so fragile , the doctors thought his legs had been broken just by lifting his legs up to change his nappy .
" We bought him a little kangaroo as his first toy , but it was so much bigger than him that one of the nurses cut the baby joey out of the kangaroo's pouch and he had that beside him instead . "
Kaven had an operation to close a heart valve in July , followed by laser treatment to save his sight after blood vessels failed to develop his eyes .
He is now ten months old and weighs 15 Ib .
He has just moved into clothes for three - month babies , and he will have to have physiotherapy until the age of five .
Miss Simmonds said : " He is so tiny that some people think he is new - born .
But he 's doing fantastically well and we are so thrilled with his progress . "
Kaven was born only eight days later than the world 's most premature surviving baby , Amillia Taylor , who was born last year in Florida at 21 weeks and six days .
Their survival will further fuel the debate over abortion laws , which still allow pregnancies to be terminated for non-medical reasons up to 24 weeks .

Anna Nicole âs Son Dies 3 Days After Her Daughter is Born
The 20 - year - old son of Anna Nicole Smith died suddenly in the Bahamas on Sunday , three days after the former Playboy Playmate gave birth to a girl , Smith âs attorney said .
A statement from Howard K. Stern , Anna Nicole Smith âs attorney , did not provide any details of Daniel Smith âs death , and he declined to comment when contacted by Reuters .
â We have yet to learn the cause of death but do not believe that drugs or alcohol were a factor , â Stern said in the statement .
â Anna Nicole is absolutely devastated by the loss of her son .
He was her pride and joy and an amazing human being . â
Daniel Smith was in the Caribbean nation where his mother , 38 , gave birth to a healthy girl on Thursday , Stern said .
He appeared in â The Anna Nicole Show , â a reality TV series that aired on the E! cable channel .

Bush Administration vaunted bogus credentials for birth control czar , records show Lindsay Beyerstein and Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Tuesday May 15 , 2007 Print This Email This Medical Directorship was part time or volunteer post , group says
The former head of the federal agency overseeing family planning programs misled the public about his qualifications and background , a RAW STORY investigation has found .
Appointed by President George W. Bush in late 2006 as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services , Dr. Eric J. Keroack resigned unexpectedly in March of this year after Massachusetts officials launched a formal investigation into allegations of Medicaid fraud during his tenure in private practice .
Medicaid is a state - federal health program for the poor .
Although as an appointee he quickly became mired in controversy over his opposition to birth control , abortion and comprehensive sex education , newly obtained documents show that from the start Dr. Keroack was far from qualified to head the federal womenÂs health program .
As Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs , Dr. Keroack was responsible for a $ 283 million budget and charged with running a federal agency overseeing womenÂs health issues such as screening for cervical and breast cancer , contraception planning , pregnancy counseling and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases .
However , a RAW STORY investigation has found that Keroack either misled the Bush administration about his background or was appointed regardless of his record and with little vetting .
HHS officials repeatedly cited KeroackÂs long tenure in private practice as one of his key qualifications , along with his highly publicized role as medical director for a chain of Christian pregnancy centers .
According to the Washington Post , Â Eric Keroack , a nationally known advocate of abstinence until marriage , served for more than a decade as medical director for A WomanÂs Concern , a Massachusetts nonprofit group that discourages abortion and does not distribute information promoting birth control .
But HHS spokeswoman Christina Pearson said yesterday that most of KeroackÂs professional time had been devoted to his private practice of 20 years , not the group . Â
Documents and interviews with KeroackÂs associates , however , show that the post of medical director was merely a part - time or volunteer job .
KeroackÂs claims of an extensive private practice also appear dubious .
Administration vaunted bogus credentials Records from the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine show that Dr. Keroack did not finish his residency in obstetrics and gynecology until 1993 .
This means he could not possibly have practiced obstetrics for 20 years .
In addition , according to the Post , Dr. KeroackÂs board certification as an OBGYN , which would have been good for ten years , had lapsed in 2005 , a full year before his appointment .
As a result , KeroackÂs tenure in private practice as a board - certified OB - GYN at the time of his appointment could have been no more than 10 years .
Documents obtained by RAW STORY suggest that Keroack may have been in practice even less time .
When Dr. Keroack took stewardship of Population Affairs in 2006 , Massachusetts Â medical licensing board had already spent roughly a year reviewing a complaint that he had violated ethical norms by prescribing medications for people who werenÂt his patients , had practiced outside of his area of specialty and had attempted to defraud the insurance system .
Massachusetts medical board spokesman Randal Aims said late last week that when a complaint is filed against a physician , the doctor is allowed to respond in writing .
In KeroackÂs Sept. 18 , 2005 response , in which he defended himself against the allegation that he was not qualified to provide counseling , he indicated that he had not been in practice for Âover 5 - years . Â
Â As you might expect , the fact that it has been over 5 - years [ sic ] since I took a leave from my direct practice of clinical medicine in the North Shore area has made the location of some of the individual single session C.M.E. lectures quite difficult , Â he wrote .
Â I confess to being less than perfect when it comes to long - term personal record keeping .Â
This indicates that as of 2005 , Keroack had withdrawn from practicing clinical medicine at least five years earlier , suggesting that the duration of his tenure in private practice was roughly five years .
The same document also includes Dr. KeroackÂs admission that he has no proof that he completed the Continuing Medical Education modules required to maintain his medical license .
HHS spokewoman Christine Pearson told the Post Keroack Âinadvertently missed the recertification deadlineÂ and Âplans to seek recertification in the future .Â
Records show that Keroack also let another professional certification lapse in 2005 .
The American College of Obstetrics and GynecologyÂs director of membership services , Bernice Jones , confirmed in a letter that KeroackÂs membership in the College had lapsed in July , 2005 .
RAW STORY asked Pearson to respond concerning these discrepancies between Dr. KeroackÂs background and the public profile presented by HHS and to provide his official biography and any press releases or statements regarding his hiring , his term in office or his resignation .
Responding via email , Pearson indicated that sheÂd never seen a copy of Dr. KeroackÂs resume .
Â I have never had a copy of his resume nor am I aware of any press releases , pre-hiring announcements or press releases pertaining to his acts while he was in office , Â Pearson wrote .
Asked to explain how she knew how long Dr. Keroack had been in practice , Pearson explained that he had personally told her of his qualifications .
Another HHS spokesperson , Rebecca Ayer , said that HHS had never had an official biography for Dr. Keroack , but provided assurances that he had gone through the Âstandard hiring process . Â
Saying she could not comment further on personnel issues due to the Privacy Act , Ayer suggested this reporter file a Freedom of Information Request .
Medical directorship was part - time or volunteer job The controversy over Dr. KeroackÂs association with A WomanÂs Concern and his particular views with regard to womenÂs health in the wake of his appointment may have overshadowed deeper issues regarding his actual background .
A WomanÂs ConcernÂs tax records show no mention of him during the six - year period he was supposed to have been the medical director .
As a non-profit , AWC is required to list all employees and contractors who are paid more than $ 50,000 per year .
Mark Conrad , the president of A WomanÂs Concern , said that Dr. Keroack was only a part - time volunteer with the organization and simultaneously rented an office at one of their facilities .
Former WomanÂs Concern president Rev. Ensor , who led the organization during most of KeroackÂs tenure , gave a different account .
Â Was he paid ?
Sure he was paid , Â Ensor said .
Â Some seasons he volunteered , and sometimes we paid him .Â
Dr. KeroackÂs private practice address during this period shows him at 103 Broadway in Revere , MA Â in the same building as one of the AWC pregnancy centers .
Both Conrad and Ensor agree that the doctor rented space from AWC but has now terminated his lease with the clinic .
The phone number for KeroackÂs office at that facility is disconnected .
The business address Dr. Keroack lists on his physician profile is in Marblehead , Mass .
The phone number is registered in the name of D. Merrick and was shown by additional background checks to be located at yet another address in Marblehead , 5 Orchard Circle .
Real estate records indicate that 5 Orchard Circle is a single - family home owned by Eric J. Keroack .
It is not clear who owns or lives at or practices out of the second Marblehead address .
RAW STORY made repeated calls to the phone the number listed in the physician profile .
During one such call , a woman answered the phone .
She did not identify herself but did confirm that the number belonged to Dr. Keroack and that there was no office or other number by which he could be reached .
Subsequent calls to the number yielded an answering machine message that strongly suggested the number was a residential line and not a doctorÂs office .
Moreover , a spokesman for the Massachusetts Secretary of StateÂs office said they have no record of Keroack Âregistering to run an office - based practice in the state .Â
Dr. Keroack did not return repeated phone calls and emails seeking comment .
KeroackÂs abrupt resignation Dr. Keroack announced in late March of this year that he was resigning to defend himself against allegations of Medicaid fraud levied against his clinical practice .
It is not clear whether the Medicaid investigation he was referring to was sparked by the ethical complaints filed with the medical board against him during his dual role as a private practice gynecologist and volunteer at A WomanÂs Concern .
It Âs possible that there are other complaints against Keroack that have yet to be resolved .
Massachusetts board spokesman Russell Aims told RAW STORY that as of January , 2007 , two earlier complaints against KeroackÂs license had been resolved .
Aims , however , stressed that medical licensing authorities in Massachusetts are prohibited from acknowledging the existence of unresolved claims still pending against a physicianÂs license .
Though he has no formal research credentials , Dr. Keroack has lectured widely from a PowerPoint presentation that uses Loony Tunes characters to illustrate his theory that premarital sex damages the female brain , making non-abstinent women incapable of forming emotional bonds .
KeroackÂs highly unorthodox medical views had originally cast doubt on his qualifications to serve as the nationÂs birth control czar .
His appointment did not require confirmation from Congress .

On my shelf I have the book " Basic Topology " by Armstrong .
After you 've fought your way through 173 pages you eventually get to the section on simplicial topology and you can start playing with one of the basic tools of modern topology : homology groups .
But you do n't want to go through all that hassle .
If you can read Haskell code then you can get there in 20 lines .
But do n't get too excited - this is n't meant to be an introduction to algebraic topology .
Instead it 's a demonstration of how incredibly expressive Haskell is .
Before starting on this project I expected it to take a couple of weeks of early morning hacking and many hundreds of lines of code .
It actually took a couple of hours .
So the goal is this : use the standard chain complex from simplicial homology to compute the Betti numbers .
First we need some code to compute the rank of a matrix .
As this is general purpose code I 'm not counting it in my 20 line budget .
It took me a little while to find a recursive implementation of this suitable for Haskell .
Basically , the idea is that a zero matrix has zero rank and the following operations leave the rank of a matrix unchanged :
Deleting a row of zeroes
Deleting a column of zeroes
Multiplying a row or column by a non-zero constant
Adding one row to another .
import List
rank m = let m' = removeZeroRows $ removeZeroColumns m in
if m'== [ ]
then 0
else let ( zero , ( pivot : rest ) ) = break ( ( 0 /= ) . head ) m' in
1+rank ( map ( cancelZero pivot ) ( zero++rest ) )
where
removeZeroColumns x = let n = foldl1 min ( map countZeros x ) in
map ( drop n ) x
removeZeroRows = filter ( or . map ( 0 /= ) )
countZeros = length .
fst . break ( 0 /=)
cancelZero ( a: as ) ( b: bs ) = zipWith ( \x y -> a*y - b*x ) as bs
d x = zip ( d' x ) ( cycle [ 1 , - 1 ] ) where
d ' [ ] = [ ]
d ' ( x:xs ) = xs : ( map ( x : ) ( d ' xs ) )
matrix basis1 basis2 op = map ( coefficients basis1 . op ) basis2 where
coefficients basis x = map ( flip coefficient x ) basis
coefficient e = sum .
lookup e
lookup k [ ] = fail " "
lookup k ( ( k ' , v ) : xs ) = if k == k' then return v else lookup k xs
grade n = filter ( ( ==( n+1 ) ) . length )
dim c = foldl1 max ( map length c ) -
1
dmatrix _ 0 = [ ]
dmatrix c n = matrix ( grade ( n - 1 ) c ) ( grade n c ) d
betti c = let d = dim c
ranks = map rank $ map ( dmatrix c ) [ 0..d ]
dims = map ( \i -> length ( grade i c ) ) [ 0..d ] in
h dims ranks where
h ( c: cs ) ( d : d' : ds ) = c - d - d ' : h cs ( d ' :ds )
h [ c ] [ d ] = [ c - d ]
One last thing is needed : if there is a non -zero value standing on its own in a row or column then deleting both the row and column that it is in reduces the matrix rank by one .
Here 's the complete code for the rank function :
With that out of the way , here is the code to compute the homology of a simplicial complex :
That 's it !
No hundred thousand line algebra library , or polygonal mesh geometry library .
Just the standard Haskell List library .
At this point I suggest looking at something like these notes on simplicial complexes .
My d function corresponds to â defined at the bottom of page 1 .
Let 's take the example at the bottom of page 2 and the top of page 3 :
example = [
[ 1,2,3 ] ,
[ 1,2 ] , [ 1,3 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 2,4 ] , [ 3,4 ] ,
[ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ]
-1
( Note I do n't have anything corresponding to F .
This is always the set containing the empty set so the code is hard coded to work as if it were there . )
If you play with the dmatrix routine you 'll see that it gives the matrices on page 3 ( transposed ) .
And now we can fire up ghci or hugs and get :
* Main > dmatrix example 1
[ [ - 1,1,0,0,0 ] , [ - 1,0,1,0,0 ] , [ 0, -1,1,0,0 ] , [ 0, -1,0,1,0 ] , [ 0,0 , - 1,1,0 ] ]
* Main > betti example
[ 2,1,0 ]
The example has 2 connected components , 1 1 - hole , and no 2 - holes .
( Quick one line summary of the whole of algebraic topology :
Make a hole in a piece of paper : that 's a 1 - hole .
Hollow out the interior of a solid sphere : that 's a 2 - hole , etc . )
Here are some more topological spaces to play with :
point = [ [ 0 ] ]
line = [ [ 0 ] , [ 1 ] , [ 0,1 ] ]
ball n = sublists [ 0..n ] \ \ [ [ ] ]
sphere n = ball ( n+1 ) \\ [ [ 0 .. ( n+1 ) ] ]
torus = [ [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] ,
[ 1,2 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 1,3 ] ,
[ 5,9 ] , [ 8,9 ] , [ 5,8 ] ,
[ 4,6 ] , [ 6,7 ] , [ 4,7 ] ,
[ 1,5 ] , [ 4,5 ] , [ 1,4 ] ,
[ 2,9 ] , [ 6,9 ] , [ 2,6 ] ,
[ 3,8 ] , [ 7,8 ] , [ 3,7 ] ,
[ 1,9 ] , [ 3,9 ] , [ 1,8 ] ,
[ 4,9 ] , [ 6,8 ] , [ 5,7 ] ,
[ 1,6 ] , [ 2,7 ] , [ 1,7 ] ,
[ 1,5,9 ] , [ 1,2,9 ] , [ 2,3,9 ] , [ 3,8,9 ] , [ 1,3,8 ] , [ 1,5,8 ] ,
[ 4,5,9 ] , [ 4,6,9 ] , [ 6,8,9 ] , [ 6,7,8 ] , [ 5,7,8 ] , [ 4,5,7 ] ,
[ 1,4,6 ] , [ 1,2,6 ] , [ 2,6,7 ] , [ 2,3,7 ] , [ 1,3,7 ] , [ 1,4,7 ] ]
* Main > betti ( sphere 3 )
[ 1,0,0,1 ]
* Main > betti ( sphere 0 )
[ 2 ]
* Main > betti torus
[ 1,2,1 ]
sublists [ ] = [ [ ] ]
sublists ( a: as ) = let b = sublists as in b ++ map ( a :) b
properSublists x = sublists x \\ [ x ]
chain f x = [ x: xs| x '
bary x = x >>= chain ( filter ( not . null ) . properSublists )
* Main > betti ( bary torus )
[ 1,2,1 ]
* Main >
dmatrix ( ( bary torus ) ) 2
The torus is copied from page 4 of the notes .
Here are some more examples :
But that 's not all .
Pay your $ 19.95 right now and I 'll throw in barycentric division for free :
As expected , barycentric division of a simplicial complex leaves the homology unchanged :
OK , I admit , it 's a little slow on the last one .
But it does have to perform unoptimised Gaussian elimination on fairly large matrices .
( Type
And here 's my laundry list of things to do with this project :
More efficiency .
The vectors over the simplices are stored incredibly inefficiently .
Compute homology groups over Z , not Q. I just use dimension counting to compute the dimensions of the homology groups over a Q .
I really ought to actually compute the kernels of these matrices and then find representatives of the homology groups .
I also need to write code to manipulate Abelian groups rather than vector spaces .
To my shame , I do n't know what the algorithms to use for the latter are .
Compute cohomology groups .
Compute homology groups associated to a poset .
( The barycentric subdivision code kinda does this already . )
Actually , this is where I started from originally .
alpheccar asked if there was a connection between certain types of Hopf algebra and the Euler characteristic .
I think the answer is yes : it comes from computing the Euler characterstic of posets used to define the Hopf algebra .
Actually , the whole renormalisation with Hopf algebras thing that alpheccar points out is reminiscent of a really beautiful paper I read years ago on " fat graphs " that computes the Euler characteristics of the very moduli spaces used in string theory .
euler c = sum ( zipWith ( *) ( betti c ) ( cycle [ 1 , - 1 ] ) )
And the last thing on my list I can do right now .
Computing the Euler characteristic , via the Betti numbers , is a one liner :
Of course I showed there was an easier way to compute this earlier
How can Haskell not be the programming language that all mathematicians should learn ?
Update : I just found some slides on the " fat graph " thing I mentioned above .
I rate it as one of the most beautiful pieces of mathematics ever .
Some time I 'll devote a whole post to it .

A bunch of WordPress profiles have jumped ship to work with a new open source blogging platform , titled Habari .
Habari represents a fresh start to the idea of blogging .
The system is fast , easy to use , and easy to modify .
New users should have no problem using and enjoying Habari .
Advanced users should have no problem tweaking Habari to do exactly what they need it to do .
Habari relies on PHP5 with PHP Data Objects ( PDO ) , and your choice of SQL database ( MySQL , PostgreSQL , SQLite ) .
Habari is strongly object oriented , and implements the full suite of the Atom Publishing Protocol .
User - created plugins make Habari do nearly anything imaginable , and a robust theme system permits the use of several popular templating solutions .
Chris J Davies and Khaled Abou Alfa are working on the design interface , and Kubrick designer Michael Heilemann is on - board as well .
Other names include Scott Merrill , Owen Winkler and Bryan Veloso .
ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s probably more , IÃ¢â¬â¢m piecing this together from IM chats , e-mails and these guysÃ¢â¬â¢ blog posts .
Will Habari stand a chance ?
Well , of course , it might even kick ass .
PHP5 offers a lot and WordPress , the main competitor if any , needs a bit of cleanup .
Still , Habari is far from launch with just SVN versions to show , so weÃ¢â¬â¢ll see .
Personally , IÃ¢â¬â¢ll follow this one closely .
We regret the tardiness of the following personal tribute to the late science fiction writer .
Unfortunately its author , a test pilot and native of the planet Tralfamadore who knew the author well , exists in all time periods at once and decided to submit his piece to us in 1892 .
Having now managed to unearth it from among a pile of discarded copies of Punch , a collection of top hats and several bottles of Josiah Ackerthwaite 's patented balsam , we are pleased to publish it here .
Kurt Vonnegut was an author , more or less .
He was one of those people who turn facts into something more than fiction and fiction into something a lot like fact .
When we met he was n't at all old , except for his eyes which had seen too much .
He called himself Billy Pilgrim .
He called himself Kilgore Trout .
You can never trust authors .
Once he said he ran a Saab dealership without telling Saab themselves .
It made him bankrupt .
He said it cost him the Nobel Prize .
He said a lot of things like that .
In the war , the big war , the one where you Earthlings tried to blow Europe into nothingness and your society into nowhere , he was a soldier .
He fought against the Germans , which was funny because his family was German - American .
That 's the sort of irony aliens who live in all times at once can appreciate .
Kurt or Billy or whoever was n't trained very well for war or for German snow .
He was captured and locked up .
That 's when he got unstuck in time .
He spent some time with us in our zoo .
He was about as happy there as he was on Earth .
We locked him up with Montana Wildhack , a motion picture star .
She had great breasts and Billy Pilgrim had a tremendous wang .
Authors get to write things that way , it 's part of the fun .
In Germany , Kurt Vonnegut saw the bombing of Dresden from the wrong side .
He saw thousands upon thousands of people killed in just two nights by other people who thought they were fighting evil .
It changed him .
He wrote Slaughterhouse 5 about what happened and people liked it .
Most every English student in the United States had to read it .
Students liked Slaughterhouse 5 because it had lots of short sentences and was kind of like science fiction .
Professors liked it because it told an important story and even Professors of English like short sentences now and again .
Kurt Vonnegut wrote other books too .
Some were great , some not so good .
For a time he was a humanist but then he changed his mind .
For a while he went about defending Intelligent Design , which just goes to prove that even novelists can make mistakes .
He became a kind of conscience for a certain type of American .
After Dresden he did n't have much time for war , which just goes to prove that even novelists can get things right .
Someone named an asteroid after him , which was nice .
Kurt Vonnegut is dead now .
So it goes .
Stalin is accused of creating the 1932 - 1933 famine in Ukraine
The decision was taken after protests by human rights groups and nationalists , AP news agency said .
Billboards saying " Those who do not pay for heating will be punished ! " appeared in the eastern city last week .
Historians say Stalin engineered the 1932 -1933 famine in Ukraine , during which up to 10 million people died .
A local energy company had come up with the idea of putting up the Stalin billboards , Ukraine 's media said .
It said at least five of them appeared in Donetsk last week .
One of the billboards showed Stalin holding a piece of paper and saying : " Comrades !
This is not a film !
This is life ! "
Utility rates have increased dramatically across Ukraine in recent months , and many residents have stopped paying them in protest .
New research published in the March issue of Psychological Science may help elucidate the relationship between religious indoctrination and violence , a topic that has gained renewed notoriety in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks .
In the article , University of Michigan psychologist Brad Bushman and his colleagues suggest that scriptural violence sanctioned by God can increase aggression , especially in believers .
The authors set out to examine this interaction by conducting experiments with undergraduates at two religiously contrasting universities : Brigham Young University where 99 % of students report believing in God and the Bible and Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam where just 50 % report believing in God and 27 % believe in the bible .
After reporting their religious affiliation and beliefs , the participants read a parable adapted from a relatively obscure passage in the King James Bible describing the brutal torture and murder of a woman , and her husband 's subsequent revenge on her attackers .
Half of the participants were told that the passage came from the Book of Judges in the Old Testament while the other half were told it was an ancient scroll discovered in an archaeological expedition .
In addition to the scriptural distinction , half of the participants from both the bible and the ancient scroll groups read an adjusted version that included the verse :
" The Lord commanded Israel to take arms against their brothers and chasten them before the LORD . "
The participants were then placed in pairs and instructed to compete in a simple reaction task .
The winner of the task would be able to " blast " his or her partner with noise up to 105 decibels , about the same volume as a fire alarm .
The test measures aggression .
As expected , the Brigham Young students were more aggressive ( i.e. louder ) with their blasts if they had been told that the passage they had previously read was from the bible rather than a scroll .
Likewise , participants were more aggressive if they had read the additional verse that depicts God sanctioning violence .
At the more secular Vrije Universiteit , the results were surprisingly similar .
Although Vrije students were less likely to be influenced by the source of the material , they blasted more aggressively when the passage that they read included the sanctioning of the violence by God .
This finding held true even for non-believers , though to a lesser extent .
The research sheds light on the possible origins of violent religious fundamentalism and falls in line with theories proposed by scholars of religious terrorism , who hypothesize that exposure to violent scriptures may induce extremists to engage in aggressive actions .
" To the extent religious extremists engage in prolonged , selective reading of the scriptures , focusing on violent retribution toward unbelievers instead of the overall message of acceptance and understanding , " writes Bushman " one might expect to see increased brutality "

The quest for a new form of green energy has taken a significant step with the purchase of a 25,000 - acre sheep farm in the Australian outback .
The huge alternative energy project is n't driven by manure , but by a 1 - kilometer - high thermal power station called the Solar Tower .
Announced several years ago , the 3,280 - foot Solar Tower is one of the most ambitious alternative energy projects on the planet : a renewable energy plant that pumps out the same power as a small reactor but is totally safe .
If built , it will be nearly double the height of the world 's tallest structure , the CN Tower in Canada .
The Solar Tower is hollow in the middle like a chimney .
At its base is a solar collector â a 25,000 - acre , transparent circular skirt .
The air under the collector is heated by the sun and funneled up the chimney by convection â hot air rises .
As it rises , the air accelerates to 35 mph , driving 32 wind turbines inside the tower , which generate electricity much like conventional wind farms .
But the Solar Tower has a major advantage over wind farms and solar generators :
It can operate with no wind , and 24 hours a day .
Thanks to banks of solar cells , the tower stores heat during the day , allowing it to produce electricity continuously .
Originally slated to be operational this year , construction of the massive project wo n't begin until 2006 at the earliest , said Roger Davey , chairman of EnviroMission Limited , the Melbourne , Australia , company behind the venture .

Watch an animation of what [ EnviroMission 's Solar Tower ] ( popChild ( ) will look like .
But the purchase of the farm , which cost $ 1 million , near Mildura , Victoria , is a " very big step " in getting the project built , Davey said .
So far , the main impediment to building the tower has been the cost , with estimates ranging from $ 500 million to $ 750 million .
Davey wo n't say how much the project will ultimately cost but said the company is considering two new engineering innovations that will reduce construction costs and improve efficiency .
" It will make the project a totally different business case , " Davey said .
The timing could n't be better .
With the price of oil topping $ 50 a barrel , many countries are looking for cheap energy and to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
" The time is now here , " Davey said .
" The world is looking for a major renewable energy source . "
It 's estimated the Solar Tower will generate 200 megawatts , enough electricity to power 200,000 homes , and will keep 830,000 tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere annually .
" Solar chimneys ( towers ) have become a hot area of research recently , " said S.A. Sherif , a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Florida , who wrote several papers on the technology in the early 1990s and is the technical editor of the Solar Energy journal .
Although expensive to build , solar towers " essentially produce energy for free , " said Sherif .
In addition , the technology has been proven to work : A 650 - foot solar tower was built in Manzanares , Spain , in 1981 by German structural engineers Schlaich Bergermann and Partner .
Producing 50 kilowatts , it operated for seven years .
But with oil prices at $ 15 a barrel in the mid-1980s , there was little interest in building a larger one , Sherif said .
And when it comes to solar power towers , size matters .
" The higher the tower , the greater the efficiency , " said Sherif .
Despite the iconic scope of Australia 's Solar Tower project , private investors may be deterred by the fact it may take 10 years or more to see a return on an investment .
" It will need some government funding to make it happen , " said Sherif .
The same was true for nuclear power â a much more complex and dangerous technology .
However , the U.S. government invested enormous sums of money to create a new source of energy from the atom .
But it was n't a particularly wise investment , according to Sherif .
" Energy from nuclear power plants remains very expensive and there is the huge waste problem , " he said .
And while there 's renewed interest in nuclear power , the world 's supply of uranium is limited , while the sun 's energy is not , he said .
EnviroMission has signed a joint - venture agreement with a Chinese company that will build several solar towers in China , said Davey .
" China has big future energy needs and has set renewable energy targets . "
Other areas â southern Asia , the Middle East and the southwestern United Statesâ have enough solar radiation to be excellent locations for solar towers , he said .
Solar power is at a tipping point , especially on the utility power plant scale , said Brad Collins , executive director of The American Solar Energy Society .
" The governors of the Western states have said they want to generate 1,000 megawatts from solar in the near future , " said Collins .
" Solar towers are a good fit for power companies because they operate 24/7 and deliver maximum energy output during the hottest part of the day just when everyone 's air conditioners are on high , " he said .
Despite the advantages of solar power towers , especially over the long term , it 's unlikely one will be built in the United States .
The federal government is pinning hopes on hydrogen as a new energy source , while continuing to overexploit fossil fuels , said Collins .
" Not many years from now we 'll have to choose between using oil for energy , plastics or fertilizers , " he said .
Meanwhile , it 's important that the Australians get their Solar Tower built , Collins said .
" There 's nothing like taking policy makers and investors to see something like that and kick the tires , " he said .

The woman was arrested when the plane landed in Australia
Sandrine Helene Sellies , 34 , who has a fear of flying , had drunk alcohol and taken sleeping tablets ahead of the flight from Hong Kong to Brisbane .
She was seen on the Cathay Pacific plane walking towards a door with an unlit cigarette and a lighter .
She then began tampering with the emergency exit until she was stopped by a flight attendant .
Defence lawyer Helen Shilton said her client had no memory of what had happened on the flight on Saturday , and that she had a history of sleepwalking .
She pleaded guilty to endangering the safety of an aircraft at Brisbane Magistrates Court and was given a 12 - month A$ 1,000 ( Â£ 429 ) good behaviour bond - she will forfeit the money if she commits another offence .

It looked for all the world as if the couple on a date -- he was darkly handsome and a little older than the pretty , petite blonde with the Russian accent -- were having a great time together .
" A really great time , " their waitress , Karri Cormican , recalled thinking .
" She was facing him , had one of her legs up on the bench seat . "
Good body language .
So it came as a shock when after the woman left the window - side table to visit the restroom , Cormican saw the man shake a white powder into the Hefeweizen beer he had ordered for his date .
" Did I really see that ? " Cormican asked herself .
" Why would he do that ?
It seemed like they were having fun . "
This was in a bar in Noe Valley that draws a mostly local crowd -- early on most days , the patrons were older folks like the 93 - year - old who got upset when the bar manager took a week off .
Later , when the restaurants on 24th Street close for the night , a younger bunch of waitstaff and kitchen workers dropped in to watch sports on television or play pinball .
Over the years , the bar has seen a lot of incarnations .
When the neighborhood was mostly blue - collar Irish and German , it was Doyle's , and then it became the Connection .
As yuppies moved into what became million - dollar Victorians in the 1990s , it became Noe 's Arc , and now it 's Noe 's Bar .
Not a place for trouble .
Not the kind of place where what looked like an attempted date rape would occur .
Or where a guy on a first date , like Joseph Szlamnik , at the time a 43 - year - old senior management assistant for the San Francisco Unified School District , would commit a crime .
Szlamnik was sentenced last week to a year in jail by Superior Court Judge Anne Bouliane on narcotic charges related to the incident .
According to the National Crime Victimization Survey conducted by the Department of Justice , 66 percent of sexual assaults in 2005 were committed by friends , acquaintances or other people intimately known to the victims .
No tally is kept specifically of date rapes .
Rape of all kinds has dropped by more than half since 1993 , said Lynn Parrish , a spokeswoman for the Rape , Abuse and Incest National Network , which operates a national hot line .
Because of educational efforts , " people are aware that these drugs are used in bars by perpetrators of all ages , " she said .
" So these two women who saw it knew what was happening . "
On the night in question , Cormican , 23 , quickly approached the bartender , Hannah Bridgeman - Oxley , 27 , and told her what she had seen .
The two women hatched a plan .
Cormican returned to the table and told Szlamnik and his date , whom the court identified only as Tatiana K. , then 34 , that the woman 's beer had come from a fermented keg and that they were going to replace it .
Cormican brought her a Stella Artois .
Cormican carried the adulterated Hefeweizen to Bridgeman - Oxley and out of sight into a back room .
They held it up to the light and saw , unmistakably , a white powder .
At a preliminary hearing last summer , Nikolas Lemos , chief forensic toxicologist at the San Francisco medical examiner 's office , identified the powder as zalepron , a prescription sleeping drug sold as Sonata .
After seeing the white powder , Bridgeman - Oxley said she " panicked a little bit .
We had to figure out a way to keep her away from this man . "
Their chance came when Tatiana went outside to smoke a cigarette .
Cormican grabbed the beer with the white powder and followed her .
It was a mild night in May 2005 -- the wheels of justice in this case , as one courtroom observer said , have ground exceedingly slowly .
Tatiana was stunned -- she said it was their first date , and they had met at a salsa dancing class only weeks before .
Earlier , he had picked her up in his BMW after her classes at City College .
" She 's a trusting young lady , " says David Merin , the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case .
Cormican had to repeat herself several times before Tatiana absorbed what had happened .
And then things got even worse .
The bartender rushed outside to tell the two women that while they had been talking , Szlamnik had dropped two pills into the new beer Tatiana had left behind on the table .
" He did it again , " she said .
All three women looked through a window and saw Szlamnik trying to wipe up beer that had foamed over the edge of Tatiana 's glass and was fizzing as if there were Alka - Seltzer in it .
In fact , as Dr. Lemos would later testify , the pills were alprazolam , commonly sold as Xanax , a central nervous system depressant prescribed to relieve anxiety .
" In combination with alcohol , " Lemos testified at the preliminary hearing , the two drugs " are encountered frequently in drug - facilitated sexual assaults ... without giving the victim the chance ... to even realize what 's going on . "
On the sidewalk , Tatiana was sobbing .
Bridgeman - Oxley stalked back into the bar with Tatiana following , swiped the foaming glass off the table and looked the stunned Szlamnik in the eye when he began to protest that she had served him a second bad beer .
He said to Tatiana , " Let 's go . "
" Your date 's over , mister , " the bartender told him .
" She 's staying with us . "
After offering to buy everybody a shot of whiskey , Szlamnik fled while Bridgeman - Oxley was calling the police , who arrived quickly and took possession of the two beers .
And the quick - thinking barmaids of Noe's -- a jukebox joint that Bridgeman - Oxley describes as " pretty chill " -- became heroines .
" These were two heroic people who stopped this crime from happening , " said Susan Breall , the judge at the preliminary hearing .
Lynn Parrish , the spokeswoman for the Rape , Abuse and Incest National Network , agreed : " I do n't remember hearing another story like this , " she said .
" They 're heroes in my book . "
Last Tuesday , Judge Bouliane sentenced Szlamnik , who had no prior criminal history , to one year in jail but suspended six months of that .
Szlamnik entered jail voluntarily in January after agreeing to plead guilty to transporting and furnishing a narcotic rather than to a crime directly related to a planned sexual assault .
He is due to be released in May .
At the time of his plea , he was terminated by the school district , said a spokesperson .
Cormican had arrived in San Francisco from Fargo , N.D. , only six months prior to the incident and still works at Noe's .
She shrugs off any attempt to call her a heroine .
" It 's just the kind of place where everybody looks out for everybody , " she said recently while working behind the bar .
" I mean , people look out for me .
I hope . "

IRAQ : Did cavemen invent the funeral ?
That was the question posed in the 1950s , when the excavation of nine Neanderthals in northern Iraq 's Shanidar cave [ wiki ] produced evidence that the 60,000 - year - old stiffs had been left there together , perhaps as part of a concerted effort to mourn their passing .
American anthropologist Ralph Solecki , who led the dig , cited a layer of many types of seeds and pollen found surrounding one grave as proof that prehistoric man invented not only the funeral , but also the floral arrangement .
Many remain unconvinced of by Solecki's findings , however - and barring the excavation of a receipt from the Grogg & Grogg Bereavement hut , the mystery of Shanidar will never be resolved .
INDIA : Think traditional funeral services are for the birds ?
Then do your best to die somewhere in the vicinity of one of the Towers of Silence , where one of the neighborhood 's Zoroastrians might give you a chance to have the exciting air burial you 've always dreamed of .
Per their religion , Zoroastrians leave their dead atop a local tower , where vultures handle the nasty business of disposing the spiritually impure flesh .
From there , it 's as simple as throwing the bare bones down into the tower 's pit , where they can rest for all eternity ( in a pile with all the others ) .
And while the Zoroastrians do offer several convenient locations throughout the deserts of Bombay and Iran for disposing of remains , you should probably act fast .
Remember , the recently declining populations of vultures make this a limited - time - only offer , so do n't delay .
GHANA : If you want an ornate but relatively inexpensive coffin , you 'll be well advised to avoid the American funeral home racket altogether and die , as no less an American than W.E.B. Du Bois did , in Ghana .
There , the dead are often buried in elaborate " fantasy coffins " that come carved in everything from airplane to fish styles .
SWEDEN : The latest technology in funeral services is that of Swedish marine biologist Susanne Wiigh - MÃ¤sak , who in 1999 patented the " ecological funeral , " a meticulous cryotechnological process that does all the work of decomposition so that you wo n't have to .
The process begins with the reduction of the corpse to a fine powder that makes your dead self healthier for the environment .
Next , scientists extract the leftover metals and send them off to be recycled - meaning that in your next life part of you may just be a Volkswagen Beetle .
Finally , the remains are ready to be sent back into Earth - and you can be sure that Earth will be glad to have you , thanks to your biodegradable casket .
Roman columbarium
ROMAN EMPIRE :
When an ancient Roman was dying , the oldest surviving male of the family leaned in close to the dying person and attempted to inhale the dying breath ( that 's just ... not sanitary ) .
They did try and put the fun back in funeral , though .
The rites lasted several days and often featured hired mourners and professional dancers .
And while most people know that the Romans liked a party , not many are aware of how much they liked fire .
Almost all Romans were cremated , and their ashes placed in a columbarium .

AM - Tuesday , 8 May , 2007 08:16:00 Reporter : Barney Porter TONY EASTLEY : A day after electing right - wing Nicolas Sarkozy to be the country 's next president , France is preparing for a new political era .
Mr Sarkozy has pledged to boost the economy by creating jobs , liberalising industrial relations laws , and cracking down on crime and illegal immigration .
More than 700 cars have been set alight and 600 people arrested in violence that hit cities across France , after it was announced he'd won office .
Paris , Lyon , Marseille , and Toulouse were among the cities hit by violence .
Mr Sarkozy takes over the Presidency from Jacques Chirac on May the 16th .
Barney Porter has more .
( Glass breaking , people calling out , banging )
BARNEY PORTER : Several hundred people went on a rampage in the Bastille area of eastern Paris , toppling motorbikes and smashing shop windows .
Running fights with police first broke out soon after the announcement that Nicolas Sarkozy had beaten Segolene Royal with 53 percent of the vote to her 47 .
She had warned a Sarkozy victory could see the country slide into violence and unrest .
That unrest continued last night , with some of the worst violence in the third - biggest city of Lyon , where officers fired tear gas to clear a window - smashing mob of around 200 .
The situation was reminiscent of the three weeks of rioting that flared in poor French suburbs in late 2005 .
Nicolas Sarkozy was then a hardline Interior Minister who described youths in such areas as " rabble " .
But the president - elect was n't in France to monitor last night 's violence .
He's on the Mediterranean island of Malta for three days of seclusion before he takes office next week .
Back home , France is in economic decline .
One in every five young people is unemployed .
Of the big economies , it has the most sluggish growth in mainland Europe , the public sector soaks up half of the country 's output and it has the fastest rising public debt in Western Europe .
French MP Herve Mariton .
HERVE MARITON :
The expectation is enormous and victory and the score of the victory make that our responsibility is great .
So action will have to start quickly .
Today is a day for victory and tomorrow is a day for action .
BARNEY PORTER : On foreign policy , he 's off to a good start .
Mr Sarkozy 's victory has been welcomed by European leaders , including the British Prime Minister , Tony Blair .
TONY BLAIR : Nicolas Sarkozy is somebody I know well , I like him very much , I respect him .
He 's a strong leader and I know he 'll want to forge a good and close partnership between Britain and France for the good of our two countries for Europe and for the wider world .
BARNEY PORTER : There 's also relief in Washington .
US State Department Spokesman , Sean McCormack .
SEAN MCCORMACK : Colin Powell had the great , had , had the best line on this .
You know , ' the US and France have had a marriage of 200 years and we 've been in marriage counselling for much of that .'
There have been ups and downs in the relationship and there was a difficult moment , the frictions over whether or not to overthrow Saddam Hussein .
BARNEY PORTER : But Mr McCormack says he 's confident about future relations .
SEAN MCCORMACK : We have great cooperation on issues from Lebanon , to Iran , to dealing with the combat against terrorism , to finding nuclear non-proliferation around the world , to dealing with Afghanistan and the issue of missile defence .
So there are a wide variety of areas in which we are cooperating very well with the French Government and it goes without saying that the US and France have deep cultural ties as well .
Tony Blair agrees .
TONY BLAIR : Today , for countries like ours , it 's also through alliances with others that we exert influence , between Britain and France , in Europe , and of course with the United States of America .

The 400 - page report was kept secret for six years
Alleged UFO sightings
In spite of the secrecy surrounding the UFO study , it seems citizens of planet Earth have little to worry about .
The report , which was completed in 2000 and stamped " Secret : UK Eyes Only " , has been made public for the first time .
Only a small number of copies were produced and the identity of the man who wrote it has been protected .
His findings were only made public thanks to the Freedom of Information Act , after a request by Sheffield Hallam University academic Dr David Clarke .
The four - year study - entitled Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK - tackles the long - running question by UFO - spotters : " Is anyone out there ? "
The answer , it seems , is " no " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Never in thirty years of working out of doors at all hours have I seen anything that cannot be explained by a few seconds reasoned thought

It adds : " There is no evidence that ' solid ' objects exist which could cause a collision hazard . "
So if there are no such things as little green men in spaceships or flying saucers , why have so many people reported seeing them ?
Well , here is the science bit .
" Evidence suggests that meteors and their well - known effects and , possibly some other less - known effects are responsible for some unidentified aerial phenomena , " concludes the report .
Meteors may have been responsible for some UFO sightings
" They appear to originate due to more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions , and are observed so infrequently as to make them unique to the majority of observers . "
People who claim to have had a " close encounter " are often difficult to persuade that they did not really see what they thought they saw .
The report offers a possible medical explanation .
" The close proximity of plasma related fields can adversely affect a vehicle or person , " states the report .
" Local fields of this type have been medically proven to cause responses in the temporal lobes of the human brain .
These result in the observer sustaining ( and later describing and retaining ) his or her own vivid , but mainly incorrect , description of what is experienced . "
There are , of course , other causes of UFOs - aeroplanes with particularly bright lights , stray odd - shaped balloons and strange flocks of birds , to name but a few .
The report admits its findings will not persuade everyone
Some UFO - spotters believe governments will always cover up the truth about UFOs , because they are afraid of admitting that there is something beyond their control .
It is not clear how much time and effort the MoD has spent looking at the skies in recent years , but it appears there are no plans for an in - depth UFO report like the one written in 2000 .
A MoD spokesperson said : " Both this study and the original " Flying Saucer Working Party " [ already in public domain in the national Archives ] concluded that there is insufficient evidence to indicate the presence of any genuine unidentified aerial phenomena .
" It is unlikely that we would carry out any future studies unless such evidence were to emerge . "
Condoleezza Rice Demonstrates How She Made It To The Top
From a new biography of Condoleezza Rice :
... Rice was drawn to Bush .
" First of all , I thought he was wonderful to be around , " she recalled , sitting on the couch in her State Department office .
" He was warm and funny and easy to be around .
I thought he had just an incredibly inquisitive mind ... You could barely finish an explanation before he was digging into it . "
Huh .
Well , I guess when you 've spent years saying things that are 178 % the opposite of reality , there 's no reason not to up the percentage to 180 % .
Still , the amount of self - degredation degradation you have to engage in to get to these positions is really something .

Which characteristics define the modern - day Republican Party ?
Glenn has some thoughts and they are downright chilling .
Salon :
Various Republican candidates attended a meeting of Club for Growth , and afterwards , National Review 's Ramesh Ponnuru spoke to Cato Institute 's President Ed Crane about what they said .
This brief report from Ponnuru is simply extraordinary : Crane asked if Romney believed the president should have the authority to arrest U.S. citizens with no review .
Romney said he would want to hear the pros and cons from smart lawyers before he made up his mind . [...]
Crane said that he had asked Giuliani the same question a few weeks ago .
The mayor said that he would want to use this authority infrequently .
That is the modern Republican Party .
Its base , its ruling factions , simply do not believe in our most basic Constitutional guarantees .
For anyone who wants to dispute that , how is it possible to reconcile the above with any claim to the contrary ?
The next time journalists want to write about political extremism by focusing on things like " the Far Left MoveOn.org " or bad words on the " Far Left blogs " -- without ever citing a single belief that is actually " extremist " -- why not instead focus on the fact that Mitt Romeny is open to , and Rudy Giuliani explicitly favors , vesting themselves with the very powers that this country was founded in order to banish ?
One of our two major political parties believes that the U.S. President should have powers that not even the pre-Revolution British King possessed .
Maybe that is worth some commentary and examination .

Despite it 's faults , here is our modern - day Democratic Party :

According to a 2002 email exchange obtained by lawyers in an Iowa case , Microsoft executives wanted to " whack "
Dell because it was focusing on Linux deals a little too much .
The first email by Bill Veghte , currently a company vice president , describes a Linux panel where a Dell executive explains their plans to increase Linux in the enterprise market .
The responses to his email start in a worried tone over market competition but quickly escalates as Paul Flessner , a senior vice president in Microsoft 's server applications unit , states :
Now there is nothing to disagree around what we should do .
We should whack them , we should make sure they understand our value , we should do all the things you and Brian suggest .
Paul Flessner then goes on to describe the advantages to promote Linux over Windows for Dell :
In the end , if I were them [ Dell ] , I would do all I could to see Linux succeed because it would put $ 50 / pc [ $ 50 per PC Dell sells ] ( or whatever our OEM license costs ) back into my pocket .
Sure Windows has greater value and lower TCO [ total cost of ownership ] and all of that .
I would keep my relationship with MS [ Microsoft ] and customers and do the dance .
But every chance I get I would invest in Linux and try to make more sales on Linux because I increase my margin by $ 50 / pc .
It is an advantage for Linux .
A recent study funded by the EU Commission concluded that " in almost all the cases , a transition toward open source reports of savings on the long - term costs of ownership of the software products . "
In addition , Microsoft has long been at the center of criticism and allegations over its alleged unfair and anticompetitive business tactics in Europe and elsewhere .

The connection was found to date back many generations
A Leicester University study found that seven men with a rare Yorkshire surname carry a genetic signature previously found only in people of African origin .
The men seem to have shared a common ancestor in the 18th Century , but the African DNA lineage they carry may have reached Britain centuries earlier .
Details of the study appear in the European Journal of Human Genetics .
The scientists declined to disclose the men's surname in order to protect their anonymity .
The discovery came out of genetic work looking at the relationship between the male , or Y , chromosome and surnames .
The Y chromosome is a package of genetic material normally found only in males .
It is passed down from father to son , more or less unchanged , just like a surname .
Rare lineage
But over time , the Y chromosome accumulates small changes in its DNA sequence , allowing scientists to study the relationships between different male lineages .
Y chromosomes can be classified into different groups ( called haplogroups ) which , to some extent , reflect a person 's geographical ancestry .
Certain haplogroups might be very common in , for example , East Asia and very rare in Europe .
By chance , the researchers discovered a white man with a rare Yorkshire surname carrying a Y chromosome haplogroup that had previously been found only in West African men .
And even there , it is relatively uncommon .
" We found that he was in haplogroup A1 , which is highly West African - specific , " said Turi King , a co-author on the study at the University of Leicester .
" It is incredibly rare , there are only 25 other people known worldwide and they are all African . "
Family tree
The individual had no knowledge of any African heritage in his family .
Sharing a surname also significantly raised the likelihood of sharing the same type of Y chromosome , with the link getting stronger as the surname gets rarer .
Analysis of Thomas Jefferson 's DNA also threw up a surprise
Of 18 people they tested , seven carried the rare African haplogroup .
Turi King and Leicester colleague Mark Jobling then commissioned a genealogist to fit the men into a family tree to see how they were related and find clues about where exactly their unusual Y haplogroup came from .
" He could only get them into two trees , one which dates back to 1788 and the other to 1789 .
He could n't go back any further .
So it 's likely they join up in the early 18th Century , " said Turi King .
The majority of the one million people who define themselves as " black " or " black British " trace their origins to immigration from the Caribbean or Africa from the middle of the 20th Century onwards .
Prior to the 20th Century , there have been various routes by which people of African ancestry might have reached Britain .
For example , the Romans recruited from Africa and elsewhere for the garrison that guarded Hadrian 's Wall .
Different routes
Another major route was through the slave trade .
" Some of the Africans who arrived in Britain through the slave trade rose quite high up in society , and we know they married with the rest of the population , " said Ms King .
" It could be either of these two routes , " she said .
Even if the two family trees link up in the 18th Century , haplogroup A1 could have reached Britain long before that .
" But my guess is that , because many slaves came from West Africa , it could have been through that route , " Ms King told BBC News .
She added that the study showed that Britain has always been composed of a mosaic of different people .
Professor Jobling echoed this view : " This study shows that what it means to be British is complicated and always has been , " he said .
" Human migration history is clearly very complex , particularly for an island nation such as ours , and this study further debunks the idea that there are simple and distinct populations or ' races ' . "
Turi King said she had since found another African Y chromosome haplogroup in a different British lineage .
There are other precedents for the finding .
The third US president , Thomas Jefferson , probably had a Y chromosome belonging to the haplogroup known as K2 .
This discovery came out of a project to determine whether he had fathered children from Sally Hemings , a slave owned by Jefferson .
The president had no surname - bearing progeny , so researchers had to test male - line descendents of his paternal uncle .
Jefferson 's father claimed Welsh ancestry .
But his Y - haplogroup is rare in Europe and has not yet been reported in Britain .
In fact , genetic studies show that Thomas Jefferson 's K2 haplogroup ultimately came from north - east Africa or the Middle East , the areas where it is most commonly found today .
The research on haplogroup A1 was funded by the Wellcome Trust .

[ Oberon ] ANN , Unix Oberon ports , release 2.4.3
Hi Oberoners , I 'm pleased to announce a new release of Unix ports of the Oberon system .
They can be used as guest systems on top of the following host systems : Solaris / SPARC , Solaris/x86 , Linux /x86 and MacOSX / ppc .
The ports will be available at the ETH server in a few days .
They can already be downloaded from : ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-bremen.de/home/fld/oberon/x86.Linux/*
ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-bremen.de/home/fld/oberon/x86.Solaris/*
ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-bremen.de/home/fld/oberon/sparc.Solaris/*
ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-bremen.de/home/fld/oberon/ppc.Darwin/*
The following has changed since release 2.3.8 : ------------------------------------------------------------------------- - boot loader All Unix Oberon ports are now shipped with two boot loaders .
The default boot - loader < arch >. oberon has the threads extension support enabled .
A second one < arch>.oberon.nothr is compiled with threads support disabled .
It can be used as a fallback if in a future version of the host system the behaviour of the threads ( posix threads in Linux ) changes again .
The user can select the needed boot loader by modifying the starup script .
The Oberon system still does not depend on threads ! - Input .
Mod
The module Input contained code which enabled users to type german umlauts on US ASCII keyboards .
This code caused more problems than it solved .
As nowadays most systems are equipped with native keyboards this code is no longer needed and got removed .
The arrow keys did n't work with num - lock or caps - lock on .
solved .
- Kernel .
Mod Kernel got a more rubust garbage collector .
The old version of the GC trapped when it came upon illegal pointer values in records .
This should never happen , but some times , after reloading modules with changed interfaces , it did .
- Compiler , Watson , OFormatter
The compilers now recognize keywords in lower case as well as in upper case if the first keyword in a compilation unit ( the keyword MODLULE ) is typed lower case .
- Threads a ) Module
Threads got a cleaner and less error prone interface and conditions were added .
A new module Semaphores which implements Dykstra 's P- and V - operations was added . b)
A race condition which happend when starting threads on multi- processor machines got fixed .
For testing and demonstation look at TestThreads .
Mod and TestSemaphores .
Mod and the new SortDemo Gadget ( see below ) .
In the Solaris ports the threads allways support priorities .
To enable priorities in the other ports , which use posix threads , the boot loader must have root previlleges .
This is the default in the MacOS port but very dangerous on Linux systems .
- Sort Demo
To see how well the Oberon Gadgets work with preemptive multitasking the sort demo , which was originally created by W. Weck and J. Gutknecht , has been modified .
It now runs in a Gadgets panel , clever quicksort got added and the main activity ( sorting ) is performed as background thread thus keeping the system alive while the demo is running .
This is done by using the Threads module of the Unix ports and it shows that it is possible to use Gadgets in conjunction with threads with minor effort .
The modfications needed to adapt the sort demo to threads are marked red in the sources ( SortDemo .
Mod , SortViews .
Mod , Sortd1Control .Mod , Sortd2Control .Mod ) .
The display speed has been adjusted to allow the users to really see what happens .
The compared elements get highlighted and the speed can be increased or decreased while the sorting is in progress .
The users can even select for animated swaps .
Or they can start two or more sorts in parallel and watch how different they do their work .
The latter is also done in a second panel ( SortDemo2 .
Panel )
I think it 's a really nice demo now which allows you to study the behaviour of the sort algorythms in great detail .
The demo got tested on Solaris8/10 sparc .
Solaris10 x86 , Linux ( fedora3 and fedora5 ) and MacOSX on single processor machines as well as on multi processor machines .

The nuts are actually seeds encased in an outer shell
Help is at hand for the Amazon rainforest and Brazil 's poverty - stricken rural people - courtesy of the country 's famous native nut .
Brazil nuts are a valuable food source with a huge market in Europe and North America : up to 7,000 tonnes of unshelled nuts and 20,000 tonnes of shelled nuts are shipped every year .
And because the trees that supply the nuts grow wild , they offer a way for communities to make a living from the forest without destroying it - something that is now being put to use in the country .
" This is a real financial resource for communities , " Dr Rafael Salomao , who works at the Museu Goeldi , one of the most important centres for the study of the Amazon , told BBC World Service 's One Planet programme .
" A tree which is over 400 years old can provide for generations and generations . "
Tree cemeteries
Brazil nuts are considered to be one of the most valuable products that can be harvested from undisturbed rainforest .
The nuts , known to Brazilians as Castanha do Para , grow uniquely in the Amazon basin .
They are hazardous to collect : each hard outer shell weighs over 1kg .
Unfortunately , when they have talked about sanctuaries - places where you can't touch any plants at all - well , they do n't exist
Hans Muller , Embrapa Institute
For many years , this meant the destruction of Brazil nut trees , even after they became officially protected .
" Sadly , today , we have cemeteries of Brazil nut trees , " said Dr Salomao .
" It 's because of the arrival of agriculture .
We call it the ' agricultural frontier ' , which goes along with cattle ranching .
" When this arrives , they destroy the forest .
First , they exploit the valuable wood , and then the cattle ranchers come and turn it into pasture .
" Having said that , they keep the Brazil nut trees as well as the rubber trees , as these are legally protected .
But they burn the forest to clear the land and the Brazil nut tree is very sensitive to fire .
After three years of repeating this process , the trees are dead . "
What is worse for Brazil nut collectors is that once the trees have been destroyed , there is little chance of getting them back .
Attempts to replace them have been largely unsuccessful .
Saplings will not grow in shade and take up to 15 years to begin producing nuts .
" Brazil nut trees do not have an easy natural regeneration , " said Hans Muller , who works at Belem 's Embrapa Institute , specialising in agricultural research in the Amazon .
" When you destroy one , it 's a real loss .
" Unfortunately , when they have talked about sanctuaries - places where you can't touch any plants at all - well , they do n't exist . "
Incentives
However , at the end of 2006 , the governor of the large state of Para announced a protected reserve of 16.4 million hectares of forest , with the aim of creating a huge conservation corridor through northern Amazon .
Amapa is home to the largest rainforest reserve in the world
" We had this idea , we 've a vast resource of Brazil nuts and we needed to create organisations in the region in order to strengthen local production , " said Ajama da Silva Mendes , from the Amapa state department of industry , commerce and minerals .
" So the government gave some incentives to create co-ops , together with the communities .
" Now we can see the promise of bigger production and better living conditions for rural workers . "
Brazil nut gatherers and their families are now able to maintain a decent livelihood .
And small - scale factories have been set up producing Brazil nut biscuits and oil , broadening the range of products available for export , meaning there is a better way for people to get a fair price for their valuable resource .
But there are further problems .
Subsidised production in Bolivia is challenging Brazil 's dominance in the market .
And when , in 2004 , the European Union found that Brazil nuts with shells on had traces of aflatoxins , which can cause liver cancer , strong regulations were put in place regarding the nuts .
While the American limit on aflatoxin levels in Brazil nuts is 15 parts per billion , the European limit is just four parts per billion .
This has hit Brazil nut exporters hard .
" In case the product does n't meet the EU 's laws , all the costs which have arisen have to be paid by the exporter , " said Benedito Mutra Emfilio , chair of Association of Brazil Nut Exporters .
" This is impossible . "
Sperm stem cells are normally found in the testes , where they divide to help provide a continuous supply of sperm .
While sperm stem cells have two sets of chromosomes , mature sperm capable of fertilising eggs have only one set .
In a first step towards creating artificial sperm cells , researchers have turned human bone marrow tissue into primitive sperm cells .
If these precursor cells can be coaxed into becoming fully functioning sperm cells , the technique could allow infertile men to father their own children , and even allow women to produce their own sperm .
But experts caution that provoking the sperm precursors to fully mature presents a serious challenge .
In July 2006 , biologist Karim Nayernia at the University of Newcastle - upon - Tyne in the UK , and colleagues reported they had successfully converted stem cells from mouse embryos into functioning sperm that could fertilise mouse eggs and produce live offspring .
Nayernia says trying this approach in humans would spark controversy as it would involve creating embryonic clones of infertile men : â If we used this method in the clinic , it would raise ethical concerns . â
He believes his latest advance , which instead used stem cells taken from bone marrow , would present fewer ethical problems .

Continuous supply
Nayernia âs team obtained the bone marrow stem cells , called mesenchymal stem cells , from four adult men who were about to undergo bone marrow transplants .
The researchers mixed these cells with proteins that promote cell growth and vitamin A , which appears to play an important role in sperm development .
This mixture converted the cells into sperm stem cells , called spermatogonium cells .
Sperm stem cells are normally found in the testes , where they divide to help provide a continuous supply of sperm ( see diagram , right ) .
While sperm stem cells have two sets of chromosomes , mature sperm capable of fertilising eggs have only one set .
Nayernia says his ongoing experiments have suggested that sperm cells derived from the bone stem cells of mice can undergo the first two of three divisions necessary to become mature sperm .
He says that his team will work to achieve all the necessary divisions in mice before trying similar manipulations with human cells .
The acid test
Experts caution that turning sperm stem cells derived from bone marrow into functioning sperm would be no small feat .
â Before we get too excited about this being a new form of infertility treatment , these cells cannot as yet be made into functioning sperm , so we have no idea if they can pass â the acid test â â the ability to fertilise female eggs as is achieved with donor sperm in IVF treatment , â says Malcolm Alison of the London School of Medicine and Dentistry in the UK .
Stem cell biologist Harry Moore at the University of Sheffield in the UK worries that sperm created from bone stem cells could have undetectable abnormalities that could cause disease in offspring .
â Unfortunately , these stem cell manipulations can lead to permanent genetic changes which would make them unsafe to use especially as a potential sperm or egg , â he says .
Nevertheless , Nayernia remains optimistic about manipulating stem cells to treat infertility , and says a positive outcome could help many men , including those whose sperm stem cells have been destroyed by potent anti-cancer drugs .
Female sperm
Nayernia hopes that one day it might be possible to inject the sperm stem cells directly into the testes of human patients , so that these men can conceive naturally as opposed to using IVF .
And women may be able to use the technique to produce sperm , allowing lesbian couples to have their own biological daughters .
Nayernia says that researchers have produced the same early - stage sperm cells in mice from bone marrow cells taken from female mice .
â It should be perfectly possible for fully functional mature sperm cells to be made from these female - derived cells too , â he told New Scientist .

Â· 22 - year study of 125,000 people ' solidifies ' linkage Â· Caffeine is not the key , as drinking tea has no effect
Drinking as little as one cup of coffee a day could help protect you from liver disease caused by alcohol , according to research published today .
People who drink one cup of coffee are 20 % less likely to have alcoholic cirrhosis than those who abstain from doing so .
And the protective effect increases with the more coffee you drink :
People who drink two or three cups a day are 40 % less likely to contract cirrhosis , while those who drink four or more cups are 80 % less likely to suffer the disease .
The findings , conducted by researchers at the Kasier Permanente , in Oakland , California , are thought to be the largest study to look at the inverse relationship between coffee and cirrhosis .
The link was first reported by researchers at the same institute in 1993 but this new study - of 125,000 people over 22 years - " solidifies the association " , Arthur L Klatsky , the lead author of the study , said .
Dr Klatsky , who was involved in the earlier research , added : " Consuming coffee seems to have some protective benefits against alcoholic cirrhosis , and the more coffee a person consumes the less risk they seem to have of being hospitalised or dying of alcoholic cirrhosis .
We did not see a similar protective association between coffee and non-alcoholic cirrhosis . "
The researchers , whose findings are published in the US journal Archives of Internal Medicine , followed more than 125,000 health plan members who underwent a medical examination between 1978 - 1985 and who , at the time , had no diagnosed liver disease .
Participants filled out a questionnaire detailing how much alcohol , coffee and tea they drank daily .
By the end of 2001 , 330 participants had been diagnosed with liver disease , including 199 with alcoholic cirrhosis - caused by the consumption , each day , of three or more units of alcohol .
Researchers - who only counted those who had been hospitalised or died because of the disease - found that the more coffee a person drank the less likely they were to develop alcoholic cirrhosis .
Drinking tea had no effect , suggesting the ingredient that protects against cirrhosis is not caffeine .
Blood tests conducted on the 5 % of drinkers who consumed the most alcohol confirmed that coffee drinkers were less likely to have high levels of enzymes in the liver - a key indicator of liver damage .
Dr Klatsky added : " Even allowing for statistical variation , this shows there is a clear association between coffee consumption and protection against alcoholic cirrhosis .
" This is not a recommendation to drink coffee .
Nor is it a recommendation that the way to deal with heavy alcohol consumption is to drink more coffee .
And while there is very little evidence that moderate coffee drinking - say up to four cups a day - is harmful to the health , that 's not the message we want to get across .
There is a lot of harm caused by heavy drinking other than liver damage . "
Dr Klatsky said that if caffeine were the key protective ingredient , he would expect to have seen some protection for heavy tea drinkers .
" We can't answer why this has happened , " he said .
" The value of this study is that it may offer us some clues as to the biochemical processes taking place inside liver cells that could help in finding new ways to protect the liver against injury . "
Cirrhosis , caused by thickening of the normal tissue , causes progressive damage and impaired function of the liver .
There are numerous causes including viruses , obesity or genetic problems - but excess alcohol is the main culprit .
Figures published in The Lancet this year show that Britons are drinking themselves into the grave at a sharply increasing rate .
In the 1950s England and Wales had low rates of liver cirrhosis deaths - for men 3.4 per 100,000 a year and for women 2.2 .
By 2001 rates were 14.1 for men and 7.7 for women .
While the US remains the world 's biggest consumer of coffee - with the average American drinking 3.2 cups a day - British men now drink an average of 1.7 cups , and women 1.5 cups a day .
Pippa has been through a ' maternal stage '
Pippa has been protecting the chocolates at Nuneaton and Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary since she was taken outside , put on a table and saw them .
Her owner , Geoff Grewcock , said : " She went straight over , climbed on the creme eggs and that was it .
She thinks they 're her eggs .
" Until she clicks they 're not real eggs , we 'll just leave her there . "
' So comical '
The 17 - year - old cockatoo , who has been at the sanctuary for about four years , is expected to live until the age of 70 .
Pippa is one of 300 birds at the Nuneaton sanctuary , which also has 50 animals .
She hates men - we 've had a builder in who had his neck bitten
Geoff Grewcock , Pippa 's owner
Mr Grewcock described her as " very , very protective " and she had been through a " maternal stage " .
He said : " She picked an egg up and threw it at a photographer with her beak as if to say ' leave my eggs alone .
They 're mine ' .
" She 's got so much character it 's unbelievable .
She hates men - we 've had a builder in who had his neck bitten .
We had to prise Pippa 's beak off his neck .
" When she attacks you , she attacks your ear lobe - she goes straight through them .
We do free ear piercing here .
" She 's ever so comical - always has been . "
SHOULD we ban the term â Europe â ?
It will be much used â and misused â at the EU 's 50 - year anniversary celebrations in Berlin .
â Europe â is certainly not the European Union .
Cities like KÃ¶nigsberg and Lemberg have been European for centuries ( albeit not under those names ) .
They wo n't be in the EU any time soon .
Even snobs who think that the mud-and - vodka belt is inhabited by barbarians would have to admit that anything that excludes Switzerland and Norway is n't complete .
The label is meaninglessly elastic .
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development stretches to include such unlikely Europeans as Turkmenistan and Mongolia .
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has ( thankfully ) a strong American presence .
So â Europe â means nothing geopolitically .
Nor does it make sense in internal politics .
The Belarus autocracy is â un-European â ?
Hang on : Belarus is the historic core of the late lamented Grand Duchy of Lithuania , once the largest state in Europe , an early modern superpower that was multicultural and multi-confessional before its time .
Calling Belarus â un - European â is like calling Virginia â un- American â .
If only the Belarusian regime were more â un- European â .
The idea that â Europe â means deeply - rooted multiparty democracy and strong institutions is fanciful , even if you look only at the past 15 years .
Try finding a common political theory that encompasses Britain , Serbia and Belgium over that period .
Look back over a century , and Europe is better termed the cradle of totalitarian dictatorship and mass murder .
What about the European Convention on Human Rights : surely that embodies the European ideal ?
Not a bit of it .
Countries outside Europe ( mostly , but not only , former British colonies ) uphold those ideals better than some European countries that have signed up to it .

â Europe â means equally little when it comes to economic models .
It is dirigiste and free - market , flexible and calcified , low - tax and high - tax , celebrating both private property and its confiscation .
â Well , what about creativity â , the Europhiles whinge , â surely the common European tradition is the wellspring of world culture ? â
True : there were at some points some common trends across the continent â the Renaissance and the Enlightenment , perhaps .
Thereafter , though , such trends were not European , but products of their time .
They stretched across oceans to the Americas and India and beyond .
European languages such as English and Spanish , when they reached other continents , produced great literature there too .
For those who use â European â as a term of approbation , surely faraway Canada and New Zealand are much more â European â than , say , Albania .
But the map does n't lie .
Albania is between Greece and Italy , the historic hearts of everything the Europhiles count their own .
Maybe distance does n't matter â maybe Vladivostok is a European town on the Pacific , and Tirana is a Levantine city in the heart of Europe ?
Fine , but then the European argument becomes even weaker .
If Europe means anything at all , it is a place on the map , stretching from the Atlantic to the beginning , middle or far end of Russia depending on your outlook and upbringing .
In short , there are too many exceptions inside the definition , and too many outsiders who share the same qualities .
If â Europe â means â tolerant â , â modern â or â civilised â , then say so â and be prepared to meet many â Europeans â who are anything but .
The more you think about it , the harder it is to find any meaningful use of the words â Europe â or â European â and anyone using them is probably trying to sell you something .
Be particularly alert if they are used by someone from the rich west , talking to the ex-communist east .
What they mean is â we got here before you â .
To which the answer â especially if you are from the lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania â should be : â No you did n't â .
In the run-up to the Nov. 7 elections , U.S. politicians from both parties are telling Iraqis that they are not doing enough to improve their own security .
Democrats are disparaging Iraqi security efforts and criticizing the Bush administration for not pressuring Iraqis to do more .
In response , the Bush administration is said to be creating a specific timetable of milestones for the Iraqi government to disarm militias , reduce sectarian violence , and increase stability and security in the country .
Such rhetoric makes for good domestic politics , but it demonstrates the height of imperial arrogance .
The U.S. invasion and occupation has ripped wide open the already fractious social fabric of Iraq , already torn by three previous wars Â the Iran - Iraq War , the first Gulf War , and the combat over the no-fly zones imposed on Iraqi territory between the Gulf War and the U.S. invasion .
The unleashing of a sectarian civil war after the U.S. invasion was predictable and predicted , even by the U.S. intelligence community .
In the wake of the incursion , the inept U.S. dissolution of the Iraqi army and the removal of Baâath Party members from the Iraqi government severely weakened the prospect of any successful Iraqi effort to deter or quell such strife .
Criticizing the bravery and loyalty of new Iraqi security forces is a way to divert attention from the failures of the U.S. military strategy .
The U.S. military , even after the debacle in Vietnam , disdained learning how to fight counterinsurgency warfare and continued to buy costly weapons for a war against a major conventional adversary that no longer exists .
The U.S. military âs reflexive use of heavy firepower , especially air power , has caused excessive Iraqi casualties and turned the Iraqi people against the United States .
Recently , increased violence in Baghdad in response to redoubled U.S. security operations shows that U.S. forces are part of the problem in Iraq , not the solution .
Until it was too late , the United States underemphasized winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people , the most crucial element of waging successful counterinsurgency warfare .
In short , U.S. politicians are essentially blaming Iraqis for not squelching the chaos and mayhem created by the United States .
Yet , if the best military in world history cannot disarm militias and pacify Iraq , how does the U.S. government expect the inexperienced Iraqi security forces to do so ?
The Iraqi central government âs authority is not extensive because Iraq is already effectively partitioned into decentralized fiefdoms policed by sectarian and ethnic militias .
Furthermore , the shaky Iraqi government is dependent on the political support of the radical Shiâite militias that it is supposed to be disarming .
Even the U.S. military is afraid to make more enemies by disarming these militias , which are nât yet launching widespread attacks against U.S. forces .
The United States is giving the Iraqi government a timetable of benchmarks to enhance security with the implicit threat that if they are not met , the United States will penalize the Iraqis or change its military strategy .
Such threats will have little effect , because the Iraqi government is incapable of disarming the militias and otherwise improving security .
Perhaps the Bush administration is setting up the Iraqis for failure so that an excuse can be found , after what looks to be an election debacle at home , to begin a slow withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq .
A slow withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , like " Vietnamization " during the later stages of the Vietnam War , will only delay the inevitable policy failure Â while getting many more U.S. service men and women killed in the meantime .
Instead , the U.S. should withdraw its forces rapidly to motivate the Shia and the Kurds running the government to share Iraqi âs oil wealth with the Sunnis , thus buying their agreement to peacefully accept the already partitioned Iraq .
Militias would not be disarmed by the central government , but would police their own designated areas .
In fact , the central government would remain only as a confederate shell or be dissolved entirely .
Although not perfect , this scenario is Iraq âs last hope to avoid an escalating civil war and give Iraqis the hope of some peace and prosperity .
