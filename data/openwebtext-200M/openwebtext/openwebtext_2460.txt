December 31 , 2008  --
Thousands of tourists pouring into Washington , D.C. for President - elect Barack Obama 's inauguration will be sharing the nation 's capital with a few thousand predominantly gay leather fetishists , in town for their annual convention .
Next January 16th , 17th and 18th brings the 25th annual Mid-Atlantic Leather Weekend to Washington , D.C. Hosted by the city 's Centaur Motorcycle Club , " a group of men with an enthusiastic interest in motorcycles , leather and other men , " the event is expected to draw between 2,000 and 3,000 attendees , according to spokesman Larry Barat .
Obama 's swearing - in on Tuesday , Jan. 20 , is expected to draw between 500,000 to four million people .
Many will likely arrive the weekend prior to sightsee and attend inaugural balls and other parties .
Leather Weekend attendees wearing their gear in public may provide visitors in town for the inauguration with something to talk about back at their hotel , but in general inauguration planners say they do n't expect the overlap to be an issue .
A spokeswoman for Obama said the president - elect would probably not attend any of the Leather Weekend events .
" Let 's just say it 's likely the president - elect will be occupied with many other activities " surrounding the inauguration , said Linda Douglass .
The crowd for Leather Weekend 2009 is expected to be smaller than in years past because inaugural attendees snapped up so many of the city 's hotel rooms , according to Barat , the function 's spokesman .
" Had we known it was going to be such a busy weekend , we might have scheduled otherwise , " he said .
" Certainly many of our guests are happy about the inauguration and some people will be attending both , " said Barat , " but for us we 're celebrating what we normally celebrate – the leather community , and our [ motorcycle ] club , and the anniversary . "
Obama 's inauguration is expected to draw a wide cross-section of America to Washington , and Leather Weekend is no different .
" We get a pretty broad range of people coming , " explained Barat .
" Some are into leather , some are into denim , some are into rubber .
Some skinheads , some bikers – recently we 've gotten young guys wearing sports gear and fantasy gear , [ like ] full football uniforms , baseball uniforms .
Pretty much the whole gamut . "
Lavish Inauguration Parties Planned in Washington
Although the inauguration is Tuesday , lavish inaugural balls will be held throughout the weekend leading up to the swearing - in .
This year , fancy inaugural parties thrown by Verizon , the National Association of Minority Government Contractors and others will be Saturday night alongside Leather Weekend 's gala event , Leather Cocktails .
That party brings together about 1,000 leather aficianados " in their best leathers " for drinks and appetizers downtown , Barat explained .
Though Obama may not appear , other politicans have joined in the leather - lovers ' fun .
" I have participated in the past " and may attend this year 's bash , said D.C. Councilmember Jim Graham .
He noted he is " not a member of the leather community as such . "
" I think that this event contributes to the rich diversity of the capital , " said Graham , speaking about Leather Weekend .
" We 've welcomed them here many times , and we welcome them again .
In my mind it 's a positive gathering of people . "

At the end of 2006 , Mode , a motion design studio in Chicago , approached Sol Sender , a graphic designer , to create a logo for Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign .
The resulting “ O ” became one of the most recognizable political logos in recent history .
I spoke with Mr. Sender a few days after the election to discuss the evolution of his design .
Steven Heller :
How did you get the job of designing the Obama logo ?
Sol Sender :
We got the job through Mode .
Steve Juras , a classmate of mine from graduate school is the creative director there .
They have a long - standing relationship with AKP&D Message and Media , a campaign consulting firm led by David Axelrod and David Plouffe among others .
Q : Have you done other political logos in the past ?
A : No , we had not .
Q : I have to ask , since many agencies that do political campaigns are simply “ doing a job , ” did you have strong feelings one way or the other for the Obama candidacy ?
A : We were excited to work on the logo and energized by the prospect of Mr. Obama ’s campaign .
However , we did n’t pursue or develop the work because we were motivated exclusively by ideology .
It was an opportunity to do breakthrough work at the right time in what ’s become a predictable graphic landscape .
Q : How many iterations did you go through before deciding on this “ O ” ?
Was it your first idea ?
A : We actually presented seven or eight options in the first round , and the one that was ultimately chosen was among these .
In terms of our internal process , though , I believe the logo — as we now know it — came out of a second round of design explorations .
At any rate , it happened quite quickly , all things considered .
The entire undertaking took less than two weeks .
Q : How did David Axelrod , Mr. Obama ’s chief strategist , respond to your initial presentation ?
A : Mode handled that .
My sense was that there was a lot of enthusiasm about the options we developed .
I was part of a presentation with Mode and Mr. Axelrod to evaluate the final two or three options .
There was a general sense that they were all good , but we felt strongly that the chosen logo was the most powerful one .
Q : Did Barack Obama have any input into the symbol at all ?
A : None that was directly communicated to us .
I believe he looked at the final two or three options , but I would n’t be able to accurately portray his reaction .
Q : What were you thinking when you conceived this idea ?
A : When we received the assignment , we immediately read both of Senator Obama ’s books .
We were struck by the ideas of hope , change and a new perspective on red and blue ( not red and blue states , but one country ) .
There was also a strong sense , from the start , that his campaign represented something entirely new in American politics — “ a new day , ” so to speak .
Q : Were you responsible or cognizant of how many variations and applications were possible when you first introduced the “ O ” ?
A : Honestly , we initially saw the mark through the lens of our work on more traditional consumer or corporate identity systems , and were concerned about it being misused .
In retrospect , I think that was a narrow viewpoint .
But this anxiety came before the campaign built such a strong internal design team .
Various vendors needed to reproduce the mark on signs , banners , and they needed some rules .
So our initial concern was compliance and consistency .
Having said that , we did think it was a strong mark — strong marks have the potential for broad successful application and viral growth — and we were cognizant of its possibilities .
We saw ( and visualized as part of the creative process ) buttons , billboards , ads , Web banners , T - shirts and hats .
We did not foresee the scope of the variations and the personal “ ownership ” that emerged , though .
We handed the logo and design assets off to the campaign in the summer of 2007 .
From that point on , everything that you ’ve seen was done by the campaign , including the “ demographic ” variations of the logo .
They also evolved the typography to uppercase , incorporated Joe Biden ’s name and added a white line around the mark .
Q : Did you have any qualms about this symbol ?
Did you ever think it was too “ branded ” and “ slick ” ?
A : We did n’t , though there were certainly instances where we sensed a need to be careful about its application .
We never saw the candidate as being “ branded , ” in the sense of having an identity superficially imposed on the campaign .
The identity was for the campaign , not just for the candidate .
And to the degree that the campaign spoke to millions of people , it may have become a symbol for something broader — some have termed it a movement , a symbol of hope .
Q : Do you think the “ O ” had any major contribution in this outcome ?
A : The design development was singularly inspired by the candidate ’s message .
Like any mark , the meaning and impact really come from what people bring to it .
Q : Now that Mr. Obama is President - elect Obama , do you see the “ O ” as having another or extended life ?
A : Well , the “ O ” was the identity for the Obama ’08 campaign and the campaign is over .
That does n’t mean that the mark will be forgotten ; I think the memorabilia from this campaign will have a long shelf life and will stand as a visible symbol of pride for people who supported the candidate and for those who see it as a representation of a watershed moment for our country .
As far as having another life , I ca n’t say .
Perhaps the 2012 campaign will hark back to it in some way .
By Evo Morales Ayma , president of Bolivia
November 28 , 2008 -- Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal -- Sisters and brothers , today our Mother Earth is ill .
From the beginning of the 21st century we have lived the hottest years of the last thousand years .
Global warming is generating abrupt changes in the weather : the retreat of glaciers and the decrease of the polar ice caps ; the increase of the sea level and the flooding of coastal areas , where approximately 60 % of the world population live ; the increase in the processes of desertification and the decrease of fresh water sources ; a higher frequency in natural disasters that the communities of the earth suffer [ 1 ] ; the extinction of animal and plant species ; and the spread of diseases in areas that before were free from those diseases .
One of the most tragic consequences of the climate change is that some nations and territories are the condemned to disappear by the increase of the sea level .
Everything began with the industrial revolution in 1750 , which gave birth to the capitalist system .
In two and a half centuries , the so called “ developed ” countries have consumed a large part of the fossil fuels created over five million centuries .
Capitalism
Competition and the thirst for profit without limits of the capitalist system are destroying the planet .
Under Capitalism we are not human beings but consumers .
Under Capitalism Mother Earth does not exist , instead there are raw materials .
Capitalism is the source of the asymmetries and imbalances in the world .
It generates luxury , ostentation and waste for a few , while millions in the world die from hunger in the world .
In the hands of capitalism everything becomes a commodity : the water , the soil , the human genome , the ancestral cultures , justice , ethics , death … and life itself .
Everything , absolutely everything , can be bought and sold and under capitalism .
And even “ climate change ” itself has become a business .
“ Climate change ” has placed all humankind before a great choice : to continue in the ways of capitalism and death , or to start down the path of harmony with nature and respect for life .
In the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , the developed countries and economies in transition committed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 5 % below the 1990 levels , through the implementation of different mechanisms among which market mechanisms predominate .
Until 2006 , greenhouse effect gases , far from being reduced , have increased by 9.1 % in relation to the 1990 levels , demonstrating also in this way the breach of commitments by the developed countries .
The market mechanisms applied in the developing countries [ 2 ] have not accomplished a significant reduction of greenhouse effect gas emissions .
Just as well as the market is incapable of regulating global financial and productive system , the market is unable to regulate greenhouse effect gas emissions and will only generate a big business for financial agents and major corporations .
The Earth is much more important than the stock exchanges of Wall Street and the world
While the United States and the European Union allocate $ 4100 billion to save the bankers from a financial crisis that they themselves have caused , programs on climate change get 313 times less , that is to say , only $ 13 billion .
The resources for climate change are unfairly distributed .
More resources are directed to reduce emissions ( mitigation ) and less to reduce the effects of climate change that all the countries suffer ( adaptation ) [ 3 ] .
The vast majority of resources flow to those countries that have contaminated the most , and not to the countries where we have preserved the environment most .
Around 80 % of the Clean Development Mechanism projects are concentrated in four emerging countries .
Capitalist logic promotes a paradox in which the sectors that have contributed the most to deterioration of the environment are those that benefit the most from climate change programs .
At the same time , technology transfer and the financing for clean and sustainable development of the countries of the South have remained just speeches .
The next summit on climate change in Copenhagen must allow us to make a leap forward if we want to save Mother Earth and humanity .
For that purpose the following proposals for the process from Poznan to Copenhagen :
Attack the structural causes of climate change
1 ) Debate the structural causes of climate change .
As long as we do not change the capitalist system for a system based in complementarity , solidarity and harmony between the people and nature , the measures that we adopt will be palliatives that will limited and precarious in character .
For us , what has failed is the model of “ living better ” , of unlimited development , industrialisation without frontiers , of modernity that deprecates history , of increasing accumulation of goods at the expense of others and nature .
For that reason we promote the idea of Living Well , in harmony with other human beings and with our Mother Earth .
2 ) Developed countries need to control their patterns of consumption -- of luxury and waste -- especially the excessive consumption of fossil fuels .
Subsidies of fossil fuel , that reach $ 150 - 250 billion [ 4 ] , must be progressively eliminated .
It is fundamental to develop alternative forms of power , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric both at small and medium scales .
3 ) Agrofuels are not an alternative , because they put the production of foodstuffs for transport before the production of food for human beings .
Agrofuels expand the agricultural frontier destroying forests and biodiversity , generate monocropping , promote land concentration , deteriorate soils , exhaust water sources , contribute to rises in food prices and , in many cases , result in more consumption of more energy than is produced .
Substantial commitments to emissions reduction that are met
4 ) Strict fulfilment by 2012 of the commitments [ 5 ] of the developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least by 5 % below the 1990 levels .
It is unacceptable that the countries that polluted the planet throughout the course of history make statements about larger reductions in the future while not complying with their present commitments .
5 ) Establish new minimum commitments for the developed countries of greenhouse gas emission reduction of 40 % by 2020 and 90 % by for 2050 , taking as a starting point 1990 emission levels .
These minimum commitments must be met internally in developed countries and not through flexible market mechanisms that allow for the purchase of certified emissions reduction certificates to continue polluting in their own country .
Likewise , monitoring mechanisms must be established for the measuring , reporting and verifying that are transparent and accessible to the public , to guarantee the compliance of commitments .
6 ) Developing countries not responsible for the historical pollution must preserve the necessary space to implement an alternative and sustainable form of development that does not repeat the mistakes of savage industrialisation that has brought us to the current situation .
To ensure this process , developing countries need , as a prerequisite , finance and technology transfer .
Address ecological debt
7 ) Acknowledging the historical ecological debt that they owe to the planet , developed countries must create an Integral Financial Mechanism to support developing countries in : implementation of their plans and programs for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change ; the innovation , development and transfer of technology ; in the preservation and improvement of the sinks and reservoirs ; response actions to the serious natural disasters caused by climate change ; and the carrying out of sustainable and eco-friendly development plans .
8 ) This Integral Financial Mechanism , in order to be effective , must count on a contribution of at least 1 % of the GDP in developed countries [ 6 ] and other contributions from taxes on oil and gas , financial transactions , sea and air transport , and the profits of transnational companies .
9 ) Contributions from developed countries must be additional to Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) , bilateral aid or aid channelled through organisms not part of the United Nations .
Any finance outside the UNFCCC cannot be considered as the fulfilment of developed country ’s commitments under the convention .
10 ) Finance has to be directed to the plans or national programs of the different states and not to projects that follow market logic .
11 ) Financing must not be concentrated just in some developed countries but has to give priority to the countries that have contributed less to greenhouse gas emissions , those that preserve nature and are suffering the impact of climate change .
12 ) The Integral Financial Mechanism must be under the coverage of the United Nations , not under the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other intermediaries such as the World Bank and regional development banks ; its management must be collective , transparent and non-bureaucratic .
Its decisions must be made by all member countries , especially by developing countries , and not by the donors or bureaucratic administrators .
Technology transfer to developing countries
13 ) Innovation and technology related to climate changes must be within the public domain , not under any private monopolistic patent regime that obstructs and makes technology transfer more expensive to developing countries .
14 ) Products that are the fruit of public financing for technology innovation and development of have to be placed within the public domain and not under a private regime of patents [ 7 ] , so that they can be freely accessed by developing countries .
15 ) Encourage and improve the system of voluntary and compulsory licenses so that all countries can access products already patented quickly and free of cost .
Developed countries cannot treat patents and intellectual property rights as something “ sacred ” that has to be preserved at any cost .
The regime of flexibilities available for the intellectual property rights in the cases of serious problems for public health has to be adapted and substantially enlarged to heal Mother Earth .
16 ) Recover and promote indigenous peoples ' practices in harmony with nature which have proven to be sustainable through centuries .
Adaptation and mitigation with the participation of all the people
17 ) Promote mitigation actions , programs and plans with the participation of local communities and indigenous people in the framework of full respect for and implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
The best mechanism to confront the challenge of climate change are not market mechanisms , but conscious , motivated and well organised human beings endowed with an identity of their own .
18 ) The reduction of the emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must be based on a mechanism of direct compensation from developed to developing countries , through a sovereign implementation that ensures broad participation of local communities , and a mechanism for monitoring , reporting and verifying that is transparent and public .
A UN for the environment and climate change
19 ) We need a World Environment and Climate Change Organisation to which multilateral trade and financial organisations are subordinated , so as to promote a different model of development that environmentally friendly and resolves the profound problems of impoverishment .
This organisation must have effective follow - up , verification and sanctioning mechanisms to ensure that the present and future agreements are complied with .
20 ) It is fundamental to structurally transform the World Trade Organiation , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the international economic system as a whole , in order to guarantee fair and complementary trade , as well as financing without conditions for sustainable development that avoids the waste of natural resources and fossil fuels in the production processes , trade and product transport .
In this negotiation process towards Copenhagen , it is fundamental to guarantee the participation of our people as active stakeholders at a national , regional and worldwide level , especially taking into account those sectors most affected , such as indigenous peoples who have always promoted the defense of Mother Earth .
Humankind is capable of saving the Earth if we recover the principles of solidarity , complementarity and harmony with nature in contraposition to the reign of competition , profits and rampant consumption of natural resources .

TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
Puzzled zookeepers in northern Japan have discovered the reason why their attempts to mate two polar bears kept failing : Both are female .
A 4 - year - old polar bear sent to impregnate a female polar bear at a zoo in Kushiro was found to be female as well .
The municipal zoo in the city of Kushiro in Hokkaido brought in a polar bear cub three years ago .
They named it Tsuyoshi , after the popular baseball outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo , and waited until it reached reproductive age .
In June , the zoo introduced Tsuyoshi to its resident bear , an 11 - year - old female named Kurumi , and waited for sparks to fly .
But much to the disappointment of zookeepers , Tsuyoshi never made any amorous advances toward Kurumi .
Earlier this month , zookeepers put Tsuyoshi under anesthesia to get to the bottom of the matter .
That 's when they made their discovery : Tsuyoshi is a female .
Still , the Kushiro zoo plans to keep Tsuyoshi because he -- or rather , she -- has become immensely popular with visitors .
" I have rather mixed feelings , given the need for breeding , but Tsuyoshi is an idol for Kushiro , " Yoshio Yamaguchi , head of the Kushiro zoo , told Japan 's Kyodo news agency .
Tsuyoshi will even keep her name .
" We will not be changing it to ' Tsuyoko ' since it is loved by citizens ( by the current name ) , " Yamaguchi said .
" Ko " is a common suffix for a Japanese female name .
Meanwhile , Tsuyoshi's " brother , " who was adopted by another zoo , has also turned out to be female , Kyodo reported .

After losing at the polls , gay rights supporters filed three lawsuits Wednesday asking the California Supreme Court to overturn Proposition 8 , an effort the measure ’s supporters called an attempt to subvert the will of voters .
“ If they want to legalize gay marriage , what they should do is bring an initiative themselves and ask the people to approve it , ” said Frank Schubert , co-chairman of the Proposition 8 campaign .
“ But they do n’t .
They go behind the people ’s back to the courts and try and force an agenda on the rest of society . ”
Lawyers for same - sex couples argued that the anti-gay - marriage measure was an illegal constitutional revision -- not a more limited amendment , as backers maintained -- because it fundamentally altered the guarantee of equal protection .
A constitutional revision , unlike an amendment , must be approved by the Legislature before going to voters .
The state high court has twice before struck down ballot measures as illegal constitutional revisions , but those initiatives involved “ a broader scope of changes , ” said former California Supreme Court Justice Joseph Grodin , who publicly opposed Proposition 8 and was part of an earlier legal challenge to it .
The court has suggested that a revision may be distinguished from an amendment by the breadth and the nature of the change , Grodin said
Advertisement
Still , Grodin said , he believes that the challenge has legal merit , though he declined to make any predictions .
Santa Clara University law professor Gerald Uelmen called the case “ a stretch . ”
UC Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky said his research found too little case law on constitutional revisions to predict how the state high court might resolve the question .
“ There is very little law about what can be done by amendment as opposed to revision , ” he said .
Jennifer Pizer , a staff lawyer for Lambda Legal , said the initiative met the test of a revision because it had far - reaching magnitude .

“ The magnitude here is that you are effectively rendering equal protection a nullity if a simple majority can so easily carve an exception into it , ” she said .
“ Equal protection is supposed to prevent the targeting and subjugation of a minority group by a simple majority vote . ”
Glen Lavy , an attorney for the Proposition 8 campaign , called the lawsuits “ frivolous ” and “ a brazen attempt to gut the democratic process . ”
The first action was filed by the ACLU , the National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal .
Santa Clara County and the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles also sued , and Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred filed a third suit on behalf of a married lesbian couple .
All the lawsuits cited the constitutional revision argument , and two of them asked the court to block Proposition 8 from taking effect while the legal cases were pending .

“ The court must hold that California may not issue licenses to non-gay couples because if it does it would be violating the equal protection clause , ” Allred said at a news conference .
A California Supreme Court spokeswoman said the court would act “ as quickly as possible ” on the challenges .
Other lawsuits could follow , but gay rights groups have called on supporters not to file cases in federal court .
They fear that a loss at the U.S. Supreme Court could set back the marriage movement decades .
“ We think it is early to go into federal court and ask federal courts to say we have a federal right to marry , ” Pizer said .

In addition to going to court , gay rights advocates sought to assure about 18,000 same - sex couples that their marriages will remain valid .
The groups cited comments by Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , who has said the initiative was not retroactive .
If the marriages are challenged in court , that case too would go to the California Supreme Court .
Experts differ on whether the law would protect the marriages .
The California Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 on May 15 that a state ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional .
The ruling also elevated sexual orientation to the constitutional status of race and gender , an elevation that provides strong legal protection from discrimination .

A massive orgy in honor of International Orgasm Day has been cancelled — ironically enough , due to too much pressure .
The International Orgasm Day Orgy
An Israeli group had apparently planned a 250 - person sex fest to take place on International Orgasm Day .
( The “ holiday ” took place on December 21st — who knew ? )
The idea , according to Israeli media , was to “ promote world peace through multiple orgasms . ”
A religious organization called the Raelian movement was the driving force behind the idea .
The group , by the way , believes aliens led to our creation .
But its International Orgasm
Day orgy simply was n’t meant to be .
The venue where it had been scheduled received numerous threats from naysayers , YnetNews.com reports — hence the aforementioned pressure — and its owner decided to back out as a result .
About International Orgasm Day
As for International Orgasm Day itself , this year was evidently the third annual occurrence .
There ’s even an online store for the thing .
Here ’s how it ’s described by the kind folks over at GlobalOrgasm.org :
It ’s the Third Annual Global Orgasm for Peace , and war still rages around the world .
The bully - boy Alpha - Mask Men everywhere are still looking for ways to prove their manhood through destruction and slaughter , with the support of global corporations that act without accountability to keep us all divided and fearful .
It ’s time for a new paradigm of partnership with each other and the Earth ; of joy in life
and love .
An Evolutionary Revolution of Partnership and Fourth - Wave Feminism , with women guiding men towards loving mindfulness ; women and men lowering the birth - rate to one child per woman ; men learning from women new definitions of “ progress ” ; less dependence on the ‘ stuff ’ we are told we need ; of conscious intention for harmony between the sexes , the races and our species and the rest of the world we share .
It can all begin with all of us feeling our personal peace and joy , then launching it out to the world .
Launching it out to the world , indeed .
You might want to avoid walking by the windows of the organization ’s headquarters on December 21 of next year .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stock prices have plunged in recent weeks .
So have oil prices .
Most Americans probably see the former as terrible news and the latter as a ray of sunshine at a dark time .
But both could contribute to a growing concern among economists - deflation .
Simply put , deflation is the opposite of inflation :
It 's when prices for a wide range of products start falling , rather than rising .
And while consumers struggling with the high cost of gas and food might think the idea of deflation sounds attractive , economists almost universally agree that it would be very bad news .
" When prices start to fall because of lack of demand , they can go well below the cost it takes to produce products , " said Bernard Baumohl , executive director of the Economic Outlook Group .
" Companies have no alternative than to cut back production and lay off a lot of workers .
That cuts demand more .
You get this vicious downward spiral in prices . "
Most economists point out that the current economic conditions do not yet suggest that deflation is present , or even imminent .
The Consumer Price Index , the government 's key inflation measure , did show no rise in prices in September .
But prices are still up 4.5 % over the past 12 months .
Baumohl puts the risk of deflation about 10 % to 15 % , and no more than 20 % .
But he said only a month ago he would have thought the risk of deflation was less than 5 % .
The credit market crisis , combined with the recent stock market declines and the plunge in home values over the past two years , is setting off the deflationary alarm bells for economists .
Paul Kasriel , chief economist with Northern Trust in Chicago , said most bouts of deflation have started with sharp declines in assets such as stocks or homes .
That has tended to lead to a loss of value of collateral for loans and ultimately , large losses by lenders and very tight credit .
" I still do n't think deflation is going to happen , " said Kasriel , who puts the chance at between 10 % and 30 % .
" But these are the initial conditions that lead to it . "
In the United States , the worst period of deflation was the Great Depression .
While a recent CNN poll found 59 % of Americans thinking that another depression is likely , most economists dismiss the threat of a depression .
But they say deflation is something that gets them worried .
And they are very careful using the word .
This week , San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen broke a taboo among
Fed officials when she said in a speech that the economy " appears to be in a recession . "
But in the same speech , she was reluctant to use the word deflation , even though she danced around the concept .
She said falling commodity prices , job losses and weak demand for products were likely to " push inflation down to , and possibly even below , rates ... consistent with price stability . "
Her reluctance to say deflation , even in a speech notable for the use of the word recession , does n't surprise economists .
" Deflation is very scary , scarier than a recession , because once you get into it , it 's hard to get out of , " said David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor's .
Wyss said deflation does n't have to lead to a 1930s style depression , with double - digit declines in economic activity and unemployment of 25 % .
But it can lead to the kind of extended economic pain seen in Japan 's so - called " lost decade , " a period that left Japan with little economic growth from the early 1990s until the middle of this decade .
" The Japanese had deflation during their lost decade when their banks were unable to create credit , " said Kasriel .
The Fed 's attention to the rising threat of deflation is encouraging , Kasriel said .
The central bank has pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system to try to spur lending and support spending and prices .
This is a sign that inflation is no longer a concern for many Fed policymakers .
" It maybe premature to worry about deflation but it 's long past the time to talk about inflation , " Wyss said .
Kasriel added that American consumers should be concerned about deflation as well - even if lower prices sound like a good " problem . "
" Sure , you feel like you 're on top of the world when you pay less than $ 3 for gas , " Kasriel said .
" But it 's not because we 've discovered new oil reserves .
It 's because demand is very weak .
It 's a symptom of a global recession rather than a cause for hope of a quick recovery in the economy . "
NOT long ago , I had the pleasure of a lengthy meeting with one of the smartest men on the planet , Warren E. Buffett , the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway , in his unpretentious offices in Omaha .
We talked of many things that , I hope , will inspire me for years to come .
But one of the main subjects was taxes .
Mr. Buffett , who probably does not feel sick when he sees his MasterCard bill in his mailbox the way I do , is at least as exercised about the tax system as I am .
Put simply , the rich pay a lot of taxes as a total percentage of taxes collected , but they do n’t pay a lot of taxes as a percentage of what they can afford to pay , or as a percentage of what the government needs to close the deficit gap .
Mr. Buffett compiled a data sheet of the men and women who work in his office .
He had each of them make a fraction ; the numerator was how much they paid in federal income tax and in payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare , and the denominator was their taxable income .
The people in his office were mostly secretaries and clerks , though not all .
It turned out that Mr. Buffett , with immense income from dividends and capital gains , paid far , far less as a fraction of his income than the secretaries or the clerks or anyone else in his office .
Further , in conversation it came up that Mr. Buffett does n’t use any tax planning at all .
He just pays as the Internal Revenue Code requires .
“ How can this be fair ? ” he asked of how little he pays relative to his employees .
“ How can this be right ? ”
Three Trends Driving U.S. Toward Economic and Dollar Collapse
TREND # 1 : Falling
Tax revenues .
Every month of job losses and every company that fails results in more lost tax revenue .
In 2007 , the government collected $ 2.568 trillion from taxpayers .
It will be less this year and next .
If the revenue loss follows the pattern set during the great depression , it will look like this :
2007 : 2.568 Trillion
2008 : 2.183 Trillion
2009 : 1.618 Trillion
2010 : 1.387 Trillion
2011 : 1.027 Trillion
TREND # 2 : Rapidly increasing US debt and liabilities .
As the government funds two wars and tries to prop up an insolvent financial system , it is quickly sinking into a financial black hole .
The US has over 10 trillion in debt outstanding , 12.8 Trillion borrowed from Social Security , and has issued 16 trillion in guarantees ( see below ) .
The government being the government , they will keep throwing more and more money at the financial crisis until something prevents them from throwing more .
Current Government 's liabilities :
National Debt ( $ 10.5 trillion )
Money borrowed and spent from Social Security ( $ 12 trillion )
Toxic assets in the Fed 's balance sheets ( $ 2.2 trillion )
Underfunded federal pensions ( $ 1 trillion )
Total = $ 26.5 Trillion in debt
Assets guaranteed by the Government 's " full faith and credit " :
Bank deposits ( 6.5 trillion )
Freddie / Fannie debt ( 5 trillion )
Money market funds ( 3 trillion , 1 year )
Interbank lending (? trillion )
senior debt of all FDIC - insured institutions ( 1.5 trillion , 3 years )
pensions backstopped by PBGC ( 3+ trillion )
Total : = $ 19 trillion guaranteed ( so far ... )
fed 's balance sheet
The best example of the US government 's complete loss of fiscal sanity is the financial horror story which is the fed 's balance sheet .
The chart below from Cumberland Advisors offers a visual depiction of the madness :
( Source : Federal Reserve Board of Governors Statistical Release H.4.1 Data through 11/5/08 . )
TREND # 3 : Decreasing appetite for US debt among foreign governments .
China and others have been willing to prop up the dollar and buy treasuries because US consumption has helped fuel their economic growth .
However , we are fast reaching the point where the benefits of allowing a US collapse are outweighing the costs .
If foreign central banks stopped financing our debt , the dollar 's value would plummet , and the loss of purchasing would greatly reduce the percentage of the world 's oil we consume ( which is nearly 50 % right now ) .
The rest of the would reap a windfall from lower prices for oil and other commodities as their currencies appreciated again the dollar .
Currently , Asian countries are still propping up the dollar to help their export sectors , but that could change rapidly as consumer spending goes off a cliff .
THESE TRENDS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE BREAKING POINT
Within the next month or two , these three trends will reach their unavoidable conclusion : a loss of faith in US debt and the dollar .
This will produce something never before seen in modern economics : simultaneous deflation and hyperinfation .
Foreign and domestic investors will rush move their wealth out of the dollar by selling US assets ( Treasuries , bonds , stocks , etc ... ) .
The selling of US assets will accelerate the deflationary collapse we have experienced so far this year , and the move out of the dollar will drive up the costs of oil , food , and other commodities we consume .
Here are a couple of ways to protect your wealth against this outcome :
--- invest in physical gold and other precious metals .
Gold does well during deflationary and inflationary periods .
For example , from 1929 to 1934 , gold went from $ 21 to $ 35 with its purchasing power rosing 17 times , and in the inflationary 80s gold hit an inflation - adjusted peak of over $ 2,000 .
In the next few months , I expect gold to soar above 2000 again .
--- invest in export oriented US companies whose share price has been depressed by the dollar rally .
For example , Coal Producers ( MEE , BTU , JRCC ) look attractive at today 's fire sale prices .
--- invest in China and other nations that have undervalued currencies and low national debt .
These foreign markets have been aggressively sold off in the last three month as investored panicked into dollars .
Finally , it might become quite unpleasant to live in a country experiencing an economic and currency collapse .
America is likely to go from developed nation to third world country in the span of a year or two , and there is likely going to be a lot of anger about the drop in living standards .
Should you manage to protect your wealth during the coming collapse ( by buying gold ) ,
It would be wise to be ready to take a long vacation to avoid any potential social unrest .

17 Nov 08 , 19:40 Coming Dollar Crash
I agree with much above , but after following the dollar for years and betting against it I have come to this conclusion .
When the dollar does collapse it will take the entire world with it .
We are a 14 trillion dollar economy , the entire world combined does not equal even 50 % of that .
What do you think the outcome of 14 Trillion dollars being pulled from the world economy will be .
In Japan and Germany , car companies will go broke , as will companies all over the world .
The truth is their has never been anything like what we are facing .
The scale of global unrest and collapse will be without comparison .
It will be a global depression like none ever seen .
I use to think if I invested in other currencies or gold I would be safe from what would come should the US Dollar collapse but their will be no place on earth to hide .
It will be awful everywhere .

The USA have been spending money they do not make or have for too long .
Its currency is soon going the way of the former Yugoslav Dinar , the Zimbabwe Dollar and list of other fiat currency that have failed .
Dont you guys know what is fiscal discipline ?.
I ’m one of two developers on an open source project .
I ’m going to try to be as vague as possible about the project , because the stimulus of this post is some developer politics that are n’t particularly important .
However , some background is required for some issues that I wish to bring up .
I ’ve been a part of this project for about two months now , and have gradually been introducing bigger and more intrusive changes .
Recently , the other developer has begun to disagree with some of my commits , and as of today has informed me ( in no uncertain terms ) that I should stick to certain key areas of the source code , and avoid touching anything else .
If I have changes I want to make outside of my designated area , I should send a patch , which he will modify to his satisfaction and check it in .
Personally , I find this grating .
I ’ve poured my soul into this project for the past two months , and I feel like I ’ve got a really good handle on the code base .
I ’m happy to discuss changes I want to make or have made , but this feels like I ’m on probation because my attempts to improve the project conflicted with the lead developer ’s vision .
Let ’s ignore whether either of us in the right here , and concentrate on what possible courses of action I have available to me .
I can :
suck it up and keep working for the project ’s benefit pout and refuse to contribute under these conditions fork the project , and take control of my own destiny
Option 3 is often touted as a fundamental right of any Free Software developer .
Since the code is completely open , anyone can take a snapshot of a project and make it their own .
This is a drastic measure , but sometimes a necessary one in cases where a hostile developer is actively stifling further work .
Leaving aside the question of the right choice in this situation , I realized today the problem with forking that is not considered by most people who evangelize Free Software ’s benefits : the brand .
The project of which I am a part has a brand .
We receive 20 - 30 downloads per day , there is a Sourceforge page , a bug tracker , user forums , and more .
The lead developer is in control of all of this , meaning that a fork will lose it all .
This severely limits the efficacy of a fork – why bother working on something if nobody ’s going to use it ?
Any user will almost certainly find the original project before coming across my fork , so there ’s precious little motivation for me besides “ I want to be my own boss . ”
While this is an isolated incident , and I have n’t spoken to anybody else about it , I would be interested to find out whether this is a legitimate concern for other projects .
The right to fork is great , but it ’s wasted if there ’s too much tying you down .

When news broke Monday that president - elect Barack Obama would tap U.S. Senator Ken Salazar ( D - CO ) as his choice for Secretary of the Interior , Colorado Democrats tempered their enthusiasm with a concerned eye turned toward the future and the 2010 elections , when the seat would be up for election .
Despite the recent bluing trend in Colorado , the Republican Party still has a strong base in Colorado .
Salazar is a centrist , and in a senate seat that is by no means a lock for Democrats , it could be argued that no matter who Gov.
Ritter choses to replace Salazar , they will have their work cut out for them defending it .
CQ Politics writes :
Salazar would have been decisively favored to win in a state that has trended Democratic in recent elections .
But the seat will be little tougher for the Democrats to hold with Salazar not on the ballot .
Whereas Salazar would have run for re-election as a six - year incumbent , the person that Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter appoints will have served less than two years by the time of the 2010 election , when he or she presumably will seek a full six - year term .
[ social_buttons ]
That being said , as an environmentalist , I ’m far more concerned about losing Salazar as a protector of Colorado ’s rivers and streams , its mineral resources , and its public lands , than I am about the job the Senator will do protecting those things as the next Secretary of the Interior .

Let ’s face it , with a large bunch of files / folders / playlists / documents etc all over the places in different computers , USB drives , various Web servers , it can really be a tedious task to get everything synchronized and put them all in places .
Conduit makes it simple for you to do so .
Conduit is a synchronization application for GNOME .
It allows you to synchronize your files , photos , emails , contacts , notes , calendar data and any other type of personal information and synchronize that data with another computer , an online service , or even another electronic device .
There is no command line required .
You are good to go as long as you know how to drag and drop .
Follow along as we show you how to install and configure Conduit in your Ubuntu machine .
Installing Conduit
The latest version ( as of this post ) of conduit is 0.3.14 while the version found in Ubuntu repo is 0.3.6 .
To get the latest version working in your Ubuntu , you can do either of the following :
In your terminal , type :
Add the following lines to the end of the file
Save and close .
Running Conduit
Open Conduit ( Applications -> Accessories -> Conduit Synchronizer )
You will see the screen below :
The left pane shows a list of data providers that you can use for synchronization while the right pane shows a blank canvas where you can use to create synchronization rules .
Not every entry in the left pane allows two - way sync .
You will have to familiarize with the three different kind of options that are represented by the blue arrow .
— This data provider can only act as a synchronization source .
You ca n’t write file into it .
— This data provider can only act as a synchronization destination .
You ca n’t pull data from it .
— This data provider can perform a two way sync .
Once you are done , let create our first rules :
In this example , we will illustrate how to synchronize your photos from the Picture folder with Facebook , Picasa and Flickr .
On the left pane under the Files and Folders entry , drag the Folder item to the right canvas .
Double click on the folder to display the folder configuration option .
Select the Picture folder and click OK .
Next , we drag Facebook , Picasa and Flickr to the canvas
Similarly , double click on each entry to enter your login credential
Once you are done , right click on the canvas and select “ Synchronize this group “ .
Synchronization will start .
The whole process will depend on the number of files , the file size and the speed of your Internet connection .
The above steps can be repeated for any form of synchronization that are available in the left pane .
You are free to mix and match and choose the way that best matches your usage pattern .
There are plenty of things that you can do with Conduit .
You can sync your Youtube videos to a local folder or to box.net , backup your Tomboy notes , sync your Google contact with Evolution etc .
It is really up to your imagination how you want to utilize it .
Although Conduit is still under heavy development , it has already show great potential as the next killer app .
Let ’s hear your comments , what extra features do you hope to see in the future version ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Barely a week in office , Barack Obama is already embroiled in the first major political challenge of his fledgling presidency -- trying to persuade Republicans to back his $ 825 billion economic stimulus plan .

Obama has big Democratic majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate , lawmakers who are likely to settle their differences with Obama over the plan and support it .
So why is he bothering with Republicans at all ?
One reason is a simple case of math .
Democrats lack a sufficient majority in the Senate to stop Republicans from engaging in vote - delaying filibuster tactics .
But more importantly , Obama needs the political cover that having some Republican support would bring for an unproven plan that will add to America ’s budget deficit and may or may not stop the U.S. economy from its downward slide .
“ Republicans offer him a degree of credibility , ” said Democratic strategist Doug Schoen , who worked in the Clinton White House .
Obama has been hearing out Republicans on their concerns .
He is to visit Capitol Hill to meet Republicans on Tuesday .
He spoke to Republican congressional leaders on Friday at the White House and urged them to think beyond their conservative base of support , as exemplified by talk radio host Rush Limbaugh .
“ You ca n’t just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done , ” Obama said , according to those familiar with the conversation .
He also reminded them of the political clout he gained by his solid election victory over Republican John McCain on November 4 .
“ I won , ” he said , in what White House press secretary Robert Gibbs described as a lighthearted moment that prompted laughter in the room .
WALKING A TIGHTROPE
When Republicans look at his plan , they see a lot of pork - barrel spending that does not seem aimed at creating jobs but rather directed at taking care of traditionally Democratic constituencies , such ass $ 16 billion in grants for college students .
They worry that it would take too long to get a lot of the stimulus money into the pipeline , and they would like to see more in the way of tax cuts .
Currently the $ 825 billion package includes $ 275 billion in tax breaks .
McCain , who has been wooed by Obama as a possible ally in the Republican minority , says he would vote against the plan as it stands now .
“ I think there has to be major rewrites if we want to stimulate the economy , ” Arizona Sen.
McCain told “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Some Republicans face the challenge of trying to stare down a popular new president who wants to do whatever it takes to save the economy from collapse .
Experts say Republicans are walking a tightrope .
“ The American people , almost 80 percent of whom approve of his presidency right now , I think will not look kindly at anything they see as partisan obstructionism , ” said Norman Ornstein , a political expert at the American Enterprise Institute .
In normal times , Republicans would be on sound political footing rejecting the kind of spending that the package entails .
Some experts are not sure they can stick to business as usual in an emergency climate , however .
“ Republicans ca n’t forsake their fundamental principles , ” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres .
“ But the country wants Republicans and Democrats to work together to address what is becoming every day a more serious crisis . ”
Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins , who typically adopts a moderate position , told MSNBC she had a lot of questions about the stimulus because it includes items that are worthwhile but “ I ’m not sure they meet the test . ”
Republican strategist Scott Reed said he believed Republican lawmakers are on safe ground questioning the scope of the package .
“ I think Republicans are very effectively bringing up the level of the spending and the effectiveness of it , ” he said .
A couple of years ago I had the idea that it might be fun to take photos of London without humans – yes , I was motivated by that scene in Westminster from 28 Days Later .
Unfortunately , not being a film director I was not really in the position to have half of London sealed off for photos – but realised that on Xmas morning there could be an opportunity .
Alas , last year it poured down with rain – but this year the weather was good , and despite having a bad cold for the past few days I was determined to get up early and cycle around the West End of London taking photos .
Despite the early hour and nature of the day , there were still some people around , and as I started heading home at around 11 am , some of the tourist locations were almost as busy as a normal day .
Below are some of my personal favourites , and the whole collection of 68 photos can be found on my usual Flickr account .
Most of the photos are literally as the scene presented itself , although on a few occasions there were the odd car I had to wait to pass , or just did n’t bother waiting and cropped the photo a bit .

" Greed , for lack of a better word , is good " : the immortal words of corporate raider Gordon Gecko , a character in Oliver Stone 's 1987 film , " Wall Street . "
Gecko continues in his speech to shareholders , " Greed clarifies , cuts through , and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit " [ source : IMDb ] .
Greed also forms the basis of capitalism .
And capitalism is founded on a free market .
Greed is another word for the economics term rational maximization .
This is the ( supposedly innate ) desire to get as much for oneself as possible .
Theoretically , this makes sense ; we humans desire to ensure our survival .
But in practice , the idea that all humans rationally maximize does n't always stand up ( see What 's the ultimatum game ? ) .

This , in part , explains why there is a long - standing debate over just how freely a free market should be allowed to operate .
That debate heated up in the United States in 2008 as the federal government took control of financially crumbling mortgage holders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The move was n't essentially dramatic ; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , though privately operated , were chartered by Congress ( Fannie Mae was chartered during the Great Depression ) .
But the takeover prompted fears of a nationalization of the U.S. economy .
Nationalization occurs when full or partial control is taken of private financial institutions , usually to avert a crisis .
Scandinavian nations successfully averted an economic meltdown through nationalization in the early 1990s , and in 2007 and 2008 , the federal government of the United States took similar actions .
The Federal Reserve Bank oversaw the buyout of investment bank Bear Stearns by rival JPMorgan , guaranteeing $ 30 billion in Stearn 's bad debt and even bending to shareholders who forced a higher price per share during the buyout .
Even more pronounced , the government took a 79.9 percent stake in private insurance company AIG in return for an $ 85 billion investment to save the company .
Under pure capitalist theory , none of these actions should 've been taken ; the government should have stood by idly while the economy tanked .
So how can a free market be " free " if it 's regulated ?
Police taser man in diabetic shock John Byrne
Published : Tuesday December 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Luckily for a driver who went into severe diabetic shock last month in Oklahoma , police arrived on the scene and called in an ambulance .
But not before they tasered and handcuffed him .
The 53 - year - old diabetic man was tasered by police after they suspected him of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol and claimed he had resisted arrest -- even though he was actually in shock .
The man 's truck has spun out on an interstate after he lost control of his vehicle .
The video below -- broadcast by CBS News -- shows the scene in El Reno , Oklahoma last month .
" It 's unfortunate in the officers ' aspect and they feel extremely bad after they learned that in fact it was a medical need and not someone who was under the influence of an intoxicant , drug or alcohol , " El Reno 's mayor told CBS .
" A spokesman for the agency that certifies officers says it 's state law for all student officers to learn how to recognize and care for type one and type two diabetic patients , " the network added .
Fungus Discovered That Makes Diesel from Cellulose
November 6th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
The setting for this discovery sounds like something out of a Dr. Seuss book .
A fungus that grows in Ulmo trees in the Patagonian Rainforest is the source of a significant discovery .
“ This is the only organism that has ever been shown to produce such an important combination of fuel substances , ” said Professor Gary Strobel from Montana State University .
“ The fungus can even make these diesel compounds from cellulose , which would make it a better source of biofuel than anything we use at the moment . ”
Like many scientific breakthroughs , scientists stumbled upon this discovery by accident .
“ Gliocladium roseum lives inside the Ulmo tree in the Patagonian rainforest .
We were trying to discover totally novel fungi in this tree by exposing its tissues to the volatile antibiotics of the fungus Muscodor albus .
Quite unexpectedly , G. roseum grew in the presence of these gases when almost all other fungi were killed .
It was also making volatile antibiotics .
Then when we examined the gas composition of G. roseum , we were totally surprised to learn that it was making a plethora of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives .
The results were totally unexpected and very exciting and almost every hair on my arms stood on end ! ”
Lab tests have shown this fungus produces a substance even more similar to diesel fuel than it did in the wild .
Genetic manipulation can help to increase the yield .
Amazingly , cellulose can be directly converted into diesel , skipping a step typically needed in biofuel production .
In other words , it can break down cellulose and produce a liquid fuel in the same process .
The next question is how cost effective this process is for making transportation fuels and further development may be needed to increase the yield of the fuel by the fungus .
This process however could open up new sources of feedstock for producing fuel , such as agricultural waste .
Like many initial discoveries , it has created more questions than answers .
“ The discovery also questions our knowledge of the way fossil fuels are made .
The accepted theory is that crude oil , which is used to make diesel , is formed from the remains of dead plants and animals that have been exposed to heat and pressure for millions of years , ” said Professor Strobel .
“ If fungi like this are producing myco - diesel all over the rainforest , they may have contributed to the formation of fossil fuels . ”

Consider the possibility that the character of God develops in the Bible .
That the way God is at the beginning is like a child .
Consider the possibility that the entire bible is a story , better yet a metaphor about the spiritual development of society and of the human mind and spirit .
Consider the possibility that your REVULSION at that immature egocentric God is EXACTLY what you are supposed to think -- at this point in your life , you need to be BETTER THAN THAT .
When I read the Torah I look for the examples of how God does better , how God 's anger is reined in and hoe God becomes more of a partner and less of an autocratic order - giver as the story progresses .

GENEVA ( AP ) — Jacques Piccard , a scientist and underwater explorer who plunged deeper beneath the ocean than any other man , died Saturday , his son ’s company said .
He was 86 .
Mr. Piccard died at his Lake Geneva home in Switzerland , according to the company , Solar Impulse .
Exploration ran in the Piccard family .
Mr. Piccard ’s father , Auguste , a physicist , was the first man to take a balloon into the stratosphere .
His son , Bertrand , was the first man to fly a balloon nonstop around the world .
Jacques Piccard helped his father invent the bathyscaphe , a vessel that allows people to descend to great depths .
On Jan. 23 , 1960 , he and Lt. Don Walsh of the United States Navy took the vessel , named the Trieste , into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific to a depth of 35,800 feet , nearly seven miles below sea level .
It remains the deepest human dive ever .
There are so many environmental issues in the world these days , but its hard to believe that in the year 2008 , we still have to talk about people who wear fur .
Although the economy has affected many people ’s shopping for the holidays , there are still some ultra-rich who do not worry about their checkbooks when buying gifts .
Yes , unfortunately , its true .
Fur coats are still “ in season ” this year ( no pun intended ) , despite the horrific practices that are employed to get these luxury items to the stores .
There are at least 5 green reasons not to buy fur for Christmas this year .
Rest assured that we will not show you explicit photos of animal abuse .
This is a clean , family blog .
I cannot promise the same for some of the links included in this post .
With that in mind , you should soon agree that we have to take a stand against the brutal slaying of animals for their fur coats .
1 . Many animals including foxes , minxes , opossums , raccoons , beavers , rabbits , bobcats , lynxes and otters are killed by horrific means , including beating and drowning , for their fur .
We cannot tell you other ways that these animals are brutally killed without upsetting some of the younger audience here at Peachy Green .
However , the alleged reason for this torture is to protect their coats from damage .
Plus , did you know that it takes about 120 chinchillas to make a single fur coat ?
Can you morally wear the lives of 120 creatures on your back ?
2 . Some animals , like foxes , are “ farm - raised ” for their coats and kept in tiny cages - with as many as 4 animals each - in which they can hardly move .
Not to mention the fact that these animals rarely get veterinary care or even clean water .
3 . Its been reported that in China , from where half of the fur garments are shipped , practices include skinning animals alive for their fur .
There are upsetting reports of animals that were thought to be deceased who actually awaken from their terrible plight .
The following video shows which celebrities do and do not wear fur coats :
4. Chances are , you do not live in an area that is so cold , you need to wear a fur coat .
In researching this article , I came across numerous articles that claimed fur coats are warmer than anything else .
O.K. - so , let ’s assume that is true .
But we do not live in Antarctica .
There is no reason why fleece , wool , and puffy coats cannot keep us warm enough through about 3 or 4 months .
In fact , we are we even assuming fur is warmest ?
I have read that fleece is warmer than fur !
5 . You can look rich and famous in more animal - friendly ways .
While I am not a fan of jewels like diamonds , I still think that celebrities and the other rich and famous among us can still flaunt their wealth without requiring the slaughter of innocent animals .
In fact , one of the world ’s richest men - Bill Gates - funnels millions to helping others .
Just catch up on the Gates Foundation !
Do you really have to engage in conspicuous consumption to impress others ?
This next video is somewhat upsetting - I promised we would not be here for shock value .
But still , you should be warned a bit before watching this 3 minute clip :
A final word of caution to the green consumer :
Be aware of allegedly faux - fur trimmed coats and sweaters .
Some claim that no fur was used , but they may actually include fur from raccoon - dog coats !
Probably your best bet is not to even wear anything that looks like fur , regardless if it is fake .
The last thing we need to do is to encourage more fur trade !
I have never owned a fur coat .
Even as a young girl , I thought that the idea of wearing another animal ’s coat sounded … well … not right .
Who knew that I had such a keen environmental sense .
Wearing fur is “ not right , ” indeed .
Its time for us to leave fur coats where they belong .
On the animals that sport them .
Roll up , roll up .
It is the great company jet fire sale .
Everything must go – and quickly .
For the credit - crunched giants of corporate America , living on the generosity of the taxpayer , it ill behoves executives to fly luxury class , and a string of expensive aircraft are finding their way on to the market .
The bosses of the big three Detroit car - makers were making a self - flagellating road trip yesterday from Motor City to Washington , where they will plead for a $ 34bn ( £ 23 bn ) government hand - out this morning , a fortnight after being ridiculed for turning up at their last meeting on $ 20,000 - per - flight corporate jets .
And Citigroup , which just 10 days ago palmed off up to $ 306bn in potential losses on to the US government , was also reported to be selling two of its fleet of aircraft , decked out with lush dining chairs and a well - stocked kitchen .
The sales threaten to usher in an era of penury for a cadre of executives who are used to flying on the company jet not just for business trips but also on holiday .
For the American public , bitter at forking out more than $ 1trn so far during the credit crisis to bail out Wall Street banks and other companies , it offers one small signal that boom - time corporate excess is being curbed .

Meanwhile , the brochures open a window on the luxury on offer to travelling executives , showing the plush , carpeted interiors with space for 12 passengers , split into three cabins .
The company is only slimming down its fleet , not selling all its planes , and although it is cagey about how many aircraft it will be left with , it justifies their use – even as it promises to be careful with them in the future .
" Executives are encouraged to fly commercial whenever possible to reduce expenses , " a spokesman said .
" Over the past eight years and to support this objective , Citi has reduced its number of aircraft by two - thirds . "
Corporate jets have long been a source of public relations trouble for the executive class , particularly during economic downturns or when the company runs into trouble .
Citigroup 's former wealth management division boss Todd Thomson was forced to quit after complaints about his profligate use of company expenses , including one occasion when he kicked fellow executives off the company jet to travel alone with the CNBC television presenter Maria Bartiromo , nicknamed the Money Honey .
Their use can also land an executive in court , as the jailed former Daily Telegraph proprietor Conrad Black found .
Accused of using his Hollinger media empire as a personal piggy bank , to the detriment of fellow shareholders , Black was charged with fraud for using 23 hours of flight time on the company jet , at a cost of $ 539,000 , to go on a two - week private holiday with his wife to the South Pacific island of Bora Bora in 2001 .
It was not one of the charges on which he was convicted , however .
Nothing in recent times compares to the public relations disaster by the Detroit automakers as their chief executives attended hearings in Washington last month to plead for some of the bailout money to stave off looming bankruptcy .
Such was the outrage that earlier this week , GM and Ford both said they would sell their fleet of jets as part of a cost - cutting plan , as a quid pro quo for getting taxpayer loans .
" Due to significant cutbacks over the past months , GM travel volume no longer justifies a dedicated corporate aircraft operation , " the company said .
Chrysler said it did not have a corporate jet facility , and instead leases jets on an as - needed basis from an outside aircraft operator , but said it is " weighing its options for future corporate travel " .
At Ford , which will sell all five of its jets , the chief executive Alan Mulally 's pay of $ 22.8 m last year included $ 752,203 for his personal use of a corporate plane , as well as personal use of the plane by his wife , children and guests " to ease the burden of Mr Mulally moving to south - east Michigan " , the company 's report to shareholders revealed .
Rick Wagoner , the GM chief executive , was putting a brave face on his 525 - mile drive to the capital , talking to the assembled media in a car park opposite his Michigan home as he set off in his Chevrolet Malibu hybrid .
" It 's a good chance for me to do some briefing and return some phone calls as well – on my hands - free , by the way . "
Mr Mulally and Bob Nardelli of Chrysler were making the same journey yesterday .
Ed Bolen , president of the National Business Aviation Association in the US , says people do n't fully appreciate the security reasons that justify a company jet .
Many companies , fearful of the threat of kidnapping , tell the top executives not to always drive the same route home .
And there is the problem of industrial espionage .
" People carrying corporate paperwork and traveling through public places always have to ask : who is capable of swiping a bag , who is reading over my shoulder ? " he said .

The Taj Mahal Palace hotel was among the gunmen 's targets India 's foreign minister has denied making a phone call that prompted Pakistan to put its forces on alert after the Mumbai attacks .
Pranab Mukherjee said the call was a hoax which Pakistan was using to divert attention from the fact its nationals were involved in the attacks .
Pakistan insists the " threatening " call , to President Asif Ali Zardari , came from India 's foreign ministry .
Meanwhile Indian police say the only gunman in custody was a " petty thief " .
Rakesh Maria , the chief police investigator , told the Associated Press news agency that the gunman , Azam Amir Qasab , had been indoctrinated by the banned Islamist militant group , Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Islamabad denies any involvement in the attacks which left at least 170 people dead , but some of the gunmen are said to have had links to Pakistani militants .

On Saturday , Pakistan 's High Commissioner to London Wajid Shamsul Hassan said Pakistan feared India was planning to launch a military strike at the height of tensions over the Mumbai attacks " to teach Pakistan a lesson " .
Mr Hassan said high - level US and British officials intervened to calm the situation .
' Confusing the public '
On Saturday , the Pakistani Dawn newspaper reported that the country had been put on high alert during the crisis after what the paper called a hoax call was made to President Zardari .
A caller claiming to be Mr Mukherjee spoke to the Pakistani leader in a threatening manner on 28 November , Dawn reported .
But Pakistan 's Information Minister Sherry Rehman later denied it could have been a hoax .
It is , however , worrying that a neighbouring state might even consider acting on the basis of such a hoax call
Pranab Mukherjee
Indian Foreign Minister
The minister said " the call was placed from a verified official Phone Number of the Indian ministry of external affairs " .
In a statement released on Sunday , India 's foreign minister insisted the call - of which he had been notified by a third country - was a hoax .
" I can only ascribe this series of events to those in Pakistan who wish to divert attention from the fact that a terrorist group , operating from the Pakistani territory , planned and launched a ghastly attack on Mumbai , " Mr Mukherjee said .
" It is , however , worrying that a neighbouring state might even consider acting on the basis of such a hoax call , try to give it credibility with other states , and confuse the public by releasing the story in part , " he said .
India says the surviving gunman was a Lashkar - e - Taiba militant Nine of the 10 militants believed to have mounted the attack on 26 November died .
Indian media have named the surviving gunman as Azam Amir Qasab .
He is described as a Pakistani , and is reported to have links to a Pakistan - based Kashmiri militant group , Lashkar - e - Taiba .
The group denies involvement .
The chief Indian investigator said that Amir Qasab had been a low - level thief , before going to a camp run by Lashkar - e - Taiba .
" The moment he came under their wings , the indoctrination started .
And that 's when he decided there should be some meaning to his life and jihad was his calling , " Rakesh Maria said .

The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration said weeks ago that they were too busy to address new concerns regarding coal dust inhalation ; the following week , they proposed new regulations to begin random drug testing of American miners .
Hundreds of retired miners die every year from black lung , a disease which has haunted coal workers since the early days of the profession .
Miners are outraged that the government entity which is supposed to protect their safety seemingly holds little concern for the impact that the job has on their health , yet has decided to make their marijuana habits an issue worth tackling .
Congress passed a law in 1969 which was intended to lower the levels of coal dust inside mines , but 40 years later , there ’s been little improvement .
In 2007 , researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that black lung cases among American miners had doubled over the past ten years.[ social_buttons ]
“ It ’s frustrating that MSHA had time to draft a regulation for drug testing when there are much bigger health and safety problems facing the nation ’s miners , ” said Nathan Fetty , a lawyer who represents coal miners .
“ For example , MSHA could have spent its time writing regulations to control respirable dust and finally eliminate black lung disease . ”
Richard Stickler , the MSHA ’s safety chief , said that while he agrees that coal dust inhalation is of primary concern , the organization has been too busy applying new regulations following the many 2006 mine accidents to take on new initiatives .
“ I ’ve got the MINER Act to implement , and ca n’t put more items on that regulatory agenda , ” said Stickler , a week before proposing the drug tests .
“ So there ’s no way I ’m going to tackle respirable dust . ”

[ digg=http://digg.com/gaming_news/13_Best_Old_School_Video_Games]
If you ’ve ever enjoyed some lazy afternoons just sitting on the rug , passing greasy controllers around , and occasionally blowing into the business end of a Nintendo cartridge , then you know what we ’re talking about here .
We ’re talking about the best old - school video games of all time .
Here goes nothing :
13 . Super Mario Bros 2 .
There are two kinds of people in this world : those who loved Mario 2 and those who hated it .
If you hated it , you just could n’t get past all the turnip - digging and carrot - tossing .
If you loved it , you picked Princess , flew through all the levels , defeated all the egg - spitting ostrich bosses , dusted your palms together , and you called it a day .
Of course , there was always that massive sense of disappointment when the end credits revealed that the entire game was just a dream Mario had one night .
What a bummer .

12 . Wolfenstein 3D .
Wolfenstein really blew open the whole world of first - person shooters back in 1992 .
It was just you , a bunch of Nazis , and a maze of neverending hallways .
Sounds scary , but you ’d be fine as long as you ate enough turkey drumsticks before battling Robot Hitler .
Mein leben !
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C00n4rDUMNo]
11 . Street Fighter 2 .
This game really evened the odds between the older brother , with the thick glasses and the calloused thumbs , and the kid sister , with the overalls and toothy aw - shucks grin .
Because that kid sister , that Nintendo novice , that rookie who never played video games , well she could just go on a hot streak of straightup neverending E. Honda hundred - hand - slaps and there really was n’t anything the older brother could do about it .
Except possibly pull her hair until she started crying .
Sorry , Nina .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qAPbXNq0dc]
10 . Duck hunt .
The great - great - grandfather of the Nintendo Wii would have to be Duck Hunt , where you used the plastic plugged - in gun to learn how to hunt .
Now , who else walked right up the TV in frustration and killed every duck from two inches away ?
You practically had to when that invincible dog started laughing at you .
There was no choice .
Plus , how else could you train for clay shooting ?
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1NyIsZXeqU]
9. Bubble Bobble .
An afternoon falling through the Bubble Bobble levels was like acid tripping for a six - year old .
The music got wilder and wilder as you and a pal continuously slaughtered robots by suffocating them in your dangerous dinosaur - spewed bubbles and then eating their dead corpses which , after you popped them , magically turned into shiny pieces of fruit .
Somehow this all made sense , too .
We must ’ve been high on Pixy Stix .
[ youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij3f4_APEow]
8. Pong .
Distributed exclusively by Sears for $ 100 a pop during the 1975 Christmas season , Pong eventually burned its way into hearts and television screens across the world .
[ youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A]
7. Mike Tyson ’s Punch Out .
Before rape , prison , and facial tattoos , Mike Tyson starred in an animated game for children .
You played as Little Mac and worked your way up the circuit by pummeling boxers like Glass Joe , Bald Bull , Mr. Sandman , and eventually Mike Tyson himself .
The characters were great and Mario even moonlighted as the referee here , once again showing his tremendous versatility and athleticism .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYR_acwm0VQ]
6. Sonic The Hedgehog .
Sonic was a great game to play when you went over to your friend ’s house and they had Sega instead of Nintendo .
Why did they have Sega instead of Nintendo ?
Well , it was either for the sports games or the blood in Mortal Kombat , one of the two .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOlpQ7sepE]
5. Tetris .
If you were lucky , you could get away with telling your parents that Tetris was educational .
It certainly looked like it was too , with all that falling geometry and the Kremlin backdrops .
Though no one could really prove it , there sure was something suspiciously mathy about it .
Of course , the greatest thing about Tetris was that you could just blame the game when you died .
Those random shapes turned us all into hollow - eyed fatalists , left staring blankly into the television , shaking our heads and saying “ I was just waiting for a line ” over and over again .
[ youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FAzHyXZPm0]
4. Solitaire in Windows 3.0 .
Solitaire was that classic boring card game that you played by yourself when the boss was n’t looking .
It ’s funny because almost everyone who finds it strangely addictive admits that it is in fact a completely terrible game .
But it sure was a good way to teach your grandpa how to use a mouse .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUTWWsMJhSI]
3. Contra .
Everyone talks about the famous Contra code that you entered during the startup screen to begin with 30 men but few people talk about how impossible this game was without the code .
You had people shooting at you from all directions , you died after one bullet , and you started the game with only three lives .
Even with the spray gun you probably only ran for about twenty seconds before getting shot and calling it quits .
So basically , Contra taught us that bullets are really dangerous and that ’s why cheating is important .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWMyoNhGHbk]
2. Super Mario Bros .
There are so many memories from this instant classic , like the creepy music in World 1 - 2 , the warp zone , the hammer brothers , the flying fish , and the first time you ever heard the phrase : “ Thank you Mario !
But our princess is in another castle ! ”
[ youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qirrV8w5SQ]
1. Super Mario Bros 3 . Fred Savage helped Mario 3 launch to fame with the ninety - minute commercial known as The Wizard .
Remember his catatonic little bro who just said ‘ Cali - forn - yah ’ the whole movie but eventually showed the world how to find the whistle ?
Yes , Mario 3 completely blew everything else away by introducing us to flying raccoons , angry suns , Tanooki and Frog suits , and that impossible Tube World .
It was a larger than life video game that provided years of fun at birthday parties and sleepovers everywhere .
For this last game , how about the original commercial instead of a clip ?
I believe it accurately captures how the world felt about this game .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz2z-ZbcxT0]
Yes , playing old school video games was always a sure way to get sore thumbs , strained eyes , and a dry mouth .
But would you trade anything for all those hours in front of the TV set exploring strange and exotic worlds with your friends ?
Yes , the sun would dip down , the lights would go off upstairs , the bowls of Doritos and cans of Pepsi would empty , but that bright , flickering light from the TV did n’t stop casting kaleidoscope shadows on the wide - eyed faces sitting three feet in front of them well into the night .
And those were some seriously good times , my friend .
Some seriously good times .
AWESOME !

ROME - Facebook said yesterday it had removed several pages from its site used by Italian neo -Nazis to incite violence after European politicians accused the internet social networking site of allowing a platform for racists .
Seven different group pages had been created on the site with titles advocating violence against gypsies .
" The existence of these groups is repulsive , " said Martin Schulz , Socialist leader in the European Parliament , which lodged a complaint with the California - based company .
Facebook said it had removed the pages because they violated its terms of use .
" Facebook supports the free flow of information , and groups provide a forum for discussing important issues .
However , Facebook will remove any groups which are violent or threatening , " it said in a statement .
Italy 's Roma , or gypsy , communities have been subjected to several attacks in recent months , while Italy 's media has focused attention on violent crimes committed by gypsies .
The government has dismantled illegal shantytowns where many Roma live .

“ 251 Mercer street ” I said , “ it is in the village , ” “ I know that ” said the driver “ are you going to NYU ? ” “ Yes ” I said .
I was going to give a lecture at Ricky and Eli’s Tuesday evening ’s Geometry Seminar and came earlier to have a chance to chat with the guys .
“ Let me tell you something ” the driver said , “ I did not finish elementary school , I left in the 6th grade and started working , and everyday I come home and have sex .
My friends who finished elementary school have sex 2 - 3 times a week , tops .
And , you know , ” continued the driver “ those who went on to finish high school , they have sex maybe once a week , no more . ”
“ I see , ” I said .
“ Some people ” continued the driver “ go to college and they get a degree , BA or BSc or something like this . ” he paused and continued “ these people have sex once a month at best ! ”
I could see where this was heading .
“ Some people go to graduate school , if they are lucky they leave after one year with a master ’s degree , ” ( I was impressed by my taxi driver ’s knowledge of the academic system ) , “ they may still have sex a few times a year , but those who stay there longer , my friend , ” the driver said in a screamy cheerful voice “ I do n’t even want to think about them . ”
We reached NYU and before I left the driver asked , “ and you mister , you look educated , what academic degree do you have ? ”
I looked him straight in the eyes and said “ I have a B. Sc ” .
Other Taxi-and - Other - Stories .
Updates : Andrei Zelevinsky had a post ( in russian ) following this taxi-story , and Simon Litsyn presented a Russian translation !
I do not understand it , but I suppose that 251 is 251 and then “ Mepcep ” must be “ Mercer ” .
Is “ Гиль Калай ” my name ?
The story was picked up in several other places and gathered additional comments of various kind .
Jeopardy - style , answers first :
The answer is : A system that encourages oligopoly : government for business , and business for government .
This is State Capitalism , and this is how it works : they get your money , in order to make you ever more dependent , ever more acquiescent .
The last few months of 2008 have been characterized by a severe economic downturn .
People in the mainstream news are finally calling it a “ recession ” , not because of any newfound integrity , but rather because they ’ve simply run out of euphemisms .
The trouble became really apparent when people began to realize the banking system is broken , although some of us had been predicting this crash for several years .
In all fairness , I had no idea the extent to which it would wreak havoc on the economies , but there you have it : unintended consequences .
I saw a boom that needed to bust in the housing market .
But I did n’t know how far it would go .
Money flooded into real estate , and consequently into mortgage - backed securities , those securities were largely held by banks and insurance giants , and when the value of these securities dropped to zero , or became so toxic that it was impossible to value them accurately ( so they were treated as if their value was zero ) the whole house of cards began to fall apart .
Financial institutions like AIG were deemed too big to fail .
The automotive manufacturers had their own epic fail , and are getting their own share of your hard - earned money .
This is what happens when consumption ( rather than production ) drives an economy .
( And do n’t give me any of that Keynesian Circular Flow bullshit . )
Lenders now illiquid , or on the precipice thereof , stopped lending , and the economy which is built on a shaky foundation of consumption , grinds to a halt .
Individuals , who for the better part of a decade had been sucking paper equity out of their mortgaged - to - the - hilt McMansions , now find themselves burdened with very real debt .
Other monolithic corporations like the American automobile manufacturers , who for years have been selling vehicles as loss - leaders in order to profit through their financial arms , found that they have a hard time making that business model work when new money is n’t continually pumped into the economic system .
The very nature of these institutions implies a massively distorted one - way dependency :
An Insurance Giant does n’t give a damn if one of its customers files bankruptcy or loses his job , but heaven forbid , a giant like AIG goes out of business , millions would be left uncovered , without affordable health insurance , and without much recourse .
Whereas , every single automotive supplier needs the Big Three ; the Big Three could give a damn if one or a hundred small machine shops closed their doors tomorrow , never to reopen .
The asymmetric dependencies are problematic in their own right .
In a free market ( the U.S.A. is not a free market ) it is unlikely that any company could ever get as big as General Motors or AIG , for the simple fact that in order to grow , they would have to be profitable , and as long as they were profitable , there would be an incentive for others to compete with them .
In a free market , where profit exists , small businesses should have easy access to capital .
Currently , regulations and restrictions prevent most people from effectively competing with large corporations .
In a free market , any large corporation would be the necessary offshoot of an extremely beneficial product : in order to be big and profitable , you have to satisfy your customers in ways none of your competition can .
General Motors , AIG , etc. , none of these companies are now or were unique in this manner , so the question is n’t about their failure , rather it should be redirected .
The question is : Producing nothing meaningfully distinguishable from , nor more valuable than their competition , how in the world did these companies ever get so big .
For bonus points : what do we do about it ?
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
" Considering how hard I work to make what I have , I do n't understand why I 'm so dumb with money " said Andy Rooney on " 60 Minutes . "
His admission came after a segment about the mysterious $ 55 trillion of credit default swaps that are traded in a shadow banking system .
" The single dumbest thing I do is invest in the stock market , " Andy says .
" It 's OK if you know what you 're doing , but I have no idea what I 'm doing and I suspect I 'm typical of a lot of Americans too .
We know how to make money but we do n't know what to do once we get it . "
Has he got an alternative ?
You bet : " There 's probably a good case to be made for someone like me keeping his money under the mattress .
We turn the mattress every couple of months , so at least I 'd get to look at it once in a while . "
The mattress ?
Yes , and " Mad Money 's " Jim Cramer agrees !
Poor guy 's in panic mode :
On a recent " Today " show he did a flip - flop , telling a shocked Ann Curry : " Whatever money you may need for the next five years , please take it out of the stock market .
Right now .
This week .
I do not believe that you should risk those assets in the stock markets . "
You heard him , stay out of the stock market for five years .
Yikes !
Is Mad Jimmy using Cool Andy's " cash under the mattress " strategy ?
Sounds like it .
Like Greenspan 's congressional mea culpa last week , Mad Jimmy 's admitting he 's been misleading you for years .
But can you trust them now ?
Maybe he and the rest of his Wall Street buddies are setting you up .
That 's right , still misleading you so you do n't go bottom - fishing for value deals before them when we finally do hit bottom .
Guess what : Cool Andy's " cash under the mattress " really was a great idea for the past 10 years , what the Wall Street Journal is now calling " the lost decade . "
Here 's how USA Today 's long - time mutual fund columnist John Waggoner framed the strategy recently :
" For retirement investors , the bear market has wiped out most gains for the decade . "
Get it ?
Not just all the losses since last year 's subprime - housing meltdown .
Not just the losses since last month 's collapse .
But all the stock market gains you thought you made the past decade :
Yes , all of them , kaput , nada , up in smoke , vanished forever .
Meanwhile , even as the market was tanking in late 2007 Wall Street bankers were splitting the $ 36 billion in bonuses they siphoned off your hard - earned investments .
Here 's how Genius John says the " cash under the mattress " strategy works :
" An investor who put $ 100 a month into the American Funds Growth Fund of America for a decade , for example , would have had $ 14,562 in his account at the end of September .
By Thursday [ 10 days ago ] , that would have shrunk to $ 11,671 , not including the fund 's upfront sales charge .
An investor who had put $ 100 a month into his mattress for a decade would have $ 12,000 . "
Bottom line :
You 've been scammed :
This is total incompetence , bordering on unethical and criminal .
If you put your hard - earned $ 12,000 under the mattress for the last decade , it would have been worth more than the $ 11,671 accumulated in a mutual fund .
But actually it 's far , far worse !
Now if you also deduct the fund 's 5.75 % load and inflation of more than 30 % the past decade , you see the stock market 's a real loser .
In short , after 10 years of blindly trusting the Wall Street 's advice about stocks , it turns out that investing in the stock market is not a money - making machine , but a big fat greedy black hole that gobbles up your money .
New ratings champ
The good news ?
Mad Jimmy has been replaced as the leading TV " talk show host " by a much bigger con artist .
The new show is called " The Great American Bailout Giveaway " and plays daily on the U.S. Treasury TV Network .
Mad Jimmy 's worth maybe a few hundred million .
Uncle Warren Buffett , maybe $ 50 billion .
But King Henry Paulson dominates the TV screen lately , because he throwing around over $ 2 trillion with his straight man , Helicopter Ben Bernanke .
So what 's King Henry recommending ?
That 's easy : Banks !
Yep , bets on banks !
You should too , right ?
Why not , he 's investing $ 125 billion in them ?
He must have a lot of confidence in banks to plunk down that much of our cash .
Long term , banks " must " be a fab - u - lous investment .
But which ones ?
Well , King Henry 's actions speak louder than Mad Jimmy 's " take your money out of the stock market for five years " contradictions .
The truth is , Henry 's now the biggest power - player in the world .
If he pulls this hat trick off , history will put him on par with J. Pierpont Morgan , who rescued the U.S. government twice , from the 1895 depression and the 1907 financial crisis .
No wonder he's now the de facto president as well as CEO and " Chief Securities Analyst " for the " New America Corporation . "
Many in the global press are calling him " King Henry . "
I 'll bet old buddies at Goldman are calling him " Savior " and will give him a nice " signing bonus " of at least $ 100 million if he rejoins Goldman , paralleling the 1 % investment banking fees we used to get when I was with Morgan Stanley .
Imagine the confidence supporting his recommendations :
He tops Uncle Warren 's $ 5 billion investment in Goldman by upping the ante to $ 125 billion in new capital for nine banks including $ 10 billion each to his old buddies at Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % and friends at Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % .
Plus as much as $ 25 billion each to other members of Wall Street 's " Old Boys Club ; " J. P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % , Citigroup C , - 2.12 % , Wells Fargo WFC , - 2.35 % , State Street STT , - 1.00 % , Bank of New York Mellon BK , - 1.22 % , plus Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % and its new subsidiary , Merrill Lynch .
Good bet ?
Worried ?
You should be :
These jokers drove America into a recession , brought down the global banking system and lost $ 10 trillion in shareholder value in the meltdown .
And yet , while some banks have been off their highs as much as 80 % , maybe it is time to think about bottom fishing .
After all , they are the bedrock of our economy .
Seriously , when they come back , they 'll have a hell of a lot of upside in a recovery .
And if they do n't , if they sink further , then we 'll all suffer because that means King Henry made a bad call and " New America Corporation " will have to file for bankruptcy , which some pundits say has already happened .
But there 's a bigger question :
Can you trust a man with so many conflicts of interest ?
Not only is King Henry the chief salesman for Reaganomics and the archconservative Bush administration , he 's worth $ 800 million , he 's a long - time investment banker who made $ 38 million in 2006 , the last year he was CEO of Goldman , and he 's clearly " feathering his nest , " as my grandmother used to call it , so that when he returns to Wall Street Jan. 20 he 'll be set up to make hundreds of millions , if not billions for himself personally with his new brand as " Master of the Financial Universe . "
Reaganomics is dead ... long live Reaganomics !
And that gets me around to the last " guest " on my show today .
You 've now heard lots of real and imagined advice from Cool Andy , Mad Jimmy , Genius John and King Henry .
So let 's consider what they say through the sharp lens of Naomi Klein , author of " The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , " an indictment of Reaganomics , free market ideologies , deregulation , privatized government and trickle - down economics .
In a recent online column , " Free Market Ideology is Far from Finished , " Nervy Naomi warned us that Reaganomics is not really " dead " just because King Henry and Helicopter Ben are nationalizing America 's major financial institutions .
The truth is : Reaganomics ideologues are merely faking their death .
They 're feeding that illusion , while dumping all their toxic debt problems onto clueless taxpayers .
In fact , the meltdown is actually part of Reaganomics " Grand Strategy . "
Here 's Nervy Naomi's analysis :
" Nobody should believe the overblown claims that the market crisis signals the death of ' free market ' ideology .
Free market ideology has always been a servant to the interests of capital , and its presence ebbs and flows depending on its usefulness to those interests .
During boom times , it 's profitable to preach laissez faire , because an absentee government allows speculative bubbles to inflate . "
Then she delivers a very disturbing warning : " When those bubbles burst , the ideology becomes a hindrance , and it goes dormant while big government rides to the rescue .
But rest assured : the ideology will come roaring back when the bailouts are done .
The massive debts the public is accumulating to bail out the speculators will then become part of a global budget crisis that will be the rationalization for deep cuts to social programs , and for a renewed push to privatize what is left of the public sector . "
Now , put all the advice from today 's " guests " in Nervy Naomi 's context , and you 'll see why we predict Wall Street banks will lead a recovery in the next few years .
But then , by 2011 , they will once again breach the " moral hazard " barrier as Reaganomics greed resurfaces in a new disguise , creating a new bubble and a bigger meltdown , triggering the " Greatest Ever Global Depression . "
Britain 's bailed - out high street banks risked the wrath of the government last night after they refused to pass on to all their mortgage customers the full benefits of the Bank of England 's decision to cut borrowing costs to the lowest level since 1951 .
Despite joint pressure from Gordon Brown and the chancellor Alistair Darling to match the one percentage point reduction in the bank rate to 2 % , both the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Halifax said their standard variable rates ( SVR ) would not be reduced by the full amount .
Halifax , Britain 's biggest mortgage lender , said it would trim only a quarter point off its SVR home loan although customers on tracker mortgages would receive the cut in full , worth £ 82 a month on a £ 150,000 mortgage .
RBS said it would " strike an appropriate balance " between the needs of borrowers and savers , but would pass on the cut in full to business customers .
The cuts in mortgage rates were triggered by the announcement from Threadneedle Street that it had cut the bank rate to its joint lowest in history in an attempt to prevent the economy sliding deeper into recession .
Darling said last night that borrowing costs had come down by a total of three percentage points in two months .
" This will help people and businesses - and I want to see these cuts passed on . "
The chancellor met bank chiefs yesterday to flesh out plans to offer up to two years ' holiday on mortgage payments if homeowners fell into difficulties .
The move from the Bank of England was widely expected after a run of poor data from every part of the economy this week suggested Britain was tipping into a longer and deeper recession than the chancellor predicted in last week 's pre-budget report .
Brown welcomed the decision and predicted the cut would not be the last .
" They made the right decision .
If the banks pass the interest rates on , it 's a benefit to homeowners across the country , " he said .
The prime minister also stepped up the pressure on the bank 's monetary policy committee ( MPC ) to cut rates further in the coming months .
" Interest rates could continue to come down .
If you 've got a period when inflation comes down , you 've got to do different things . "
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said ministers should get tough with high street banks if they refused to pass on the rate cut .
" This decision was spot -on .
The Bank of England could not be clearer about what it expects the high street banks to do .
The government must now pull every lever of influence to get banks lending .
If that does n't work , radical measures will be needed straightaway .
The alternative is a wave of bankruptcy and redundancy . "
The Halifax said its decision to cut its SVR from 5 % to 4.75 % was the result of balancing the interests of customers with " the commercial imperative of managing its business in a sustainable and prudent fashion " .
Following the market mayhem this autumn , the taxpayer now owns almost 60 % of RBS and is likely to have a stake of nearly 50 % in the country 's biggest commercial bank once the merger between Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank of Scotland ( HBOS ) is completed .
The high street banks believe they are receiving mixed messages from Whitehall , with ministers urging them to both increase their lending and to run their businesses profitably so that they can repay state loans .
Rewind to 1951
It was the year Britain returned Winston Churchill to office aged 77 , Newcastle United beat Blackpool in the FA Cup , and free spectacles and false teeth on the NHS were halted .
Pendlebury delivered the famous line " It 's a good job we 're both honest men " in The Lavender Hill Mob - a cinema ticket to see Alec Guinness and Sid James cost 2d , or 21 p today , a Morris Minor around £ 520 ( £ 12,000 ) .
Some goods were still rationed , and a loaf of bread cost 6d .
The year was 1951 , and it was the last time the Bank 's base rate was 2 % <.
It was also the year that Gordon Brown was born .

If your SEO campaign is not performing as well as you ’d hoped , then there could be something missing .
If you ’ve spent a long time on it , but traffic is n’t up to par , and you ’re no doubt wondering what could be amiss .
Read on to discover what might be missing or not in alignment with what works well for Google when it comes to search engine optimisation .
1 . Your website is out of date
There are a few aspects in this arena that are going to mess up your chances of performing well if they are n’t set up properly .
Refine your architecture
First off , your website architecture needs to be simple .
This means that any visitor should be able to reach any page that they want to get to in under three clicks .
Keep things simple and you ’ll help them to navigate to their destination .
Keep these points in mind for best results :
Every main page needs to be accessible directly from the main menu on your home page
The structure that you use needs to be logical and easy to use .
It needs to be predictable to users .
Use breadcrumbs to aid navigation of the site .
Ensure that the search engines can crawl your website with ease .
You may want to use HTML and CSS code to improve this .
Sites with a structure that ’s easy to use can even be awarded Google ’s site links which will give you added visibility and overall improve your SERPs performance .
Check the speed of your website
A very important ranking factor is site speed .
You can check the speed of your website and see suggestions on what you can improve on Pingdom or Google PageSpeed Insights tool .
An improved loading time can deliver a good improvement in ranking .
Improvements can often be made on :
Better hosting or upgraded server
Hosting larger files externally – ie on Dropbox
By resizing and compressing images
Many image heavy websites opt to use a Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) for image delivery
Keep redirects to a minimum
Mobile Friendly Responsiveness
Now that more people use mobile devices to search and browse the internet , it ’s become particularly important for your site to be responsive to them and react with speed .
Google uses the mobile version of your site to index it and determine where it will appear in SERPs .
Links need to be easy to see and use and the site needs to fit the size of the smaller screens of any device used to access it .
You can read more about Google ’s mobile - first indexing here where best practices are listed .
HTTPS security
By switching from HTTP to HTTPS which offers improved security , you may benefit from a helpful ranking boost .
Soon it will become necessary to move again to HTTP /2 .
2. Your On - Page SEO is not up to scratch
Without staying current with the best practices of on - page SEO , your site could well be suffering .
Here are the most common points to consider :
URL
Using a URL structure that is not clear and free of clutter could impact your results .
They would ideally not contain numbers , be predictable and contain your main keywords ( but not stuffed ) .
Preferably you ’ll be using hyphens rather than underscores .
Meta Tags
Using title tags , a good meta description and using both your primary and secondary keywords help .
Keep your title tag under 60 characters and ensure that every page is unique .
Link Structure
Check your Google webmaster tool to ensure that you do n’t have any broken links and that your structure is well designed .
By adding relevant internal links that go deep , you ’ll be helping your visitors at the same time as improving your ranking .
Use follow links but do n’t link to excess .
Look into RankBrain too as this is one of the most important ranking factors that Google is applying .
It ’s geared towards machines learning from your content , and the easiest way to help them to do that is to use a schema markup .
These schemas are universally understood by search engines , and they can then pick out pieces to present to users of their search engines .
3 . Your links are not well built
In addition to internal linking , it ’s important to build links that go into your site .
Ideally , they will be coming from authority domains that you can secure via guest posting .
Keep these factors in mind ;
Low - quality links to your site should be disavowed
Do not take part in link networks
build relationships so that you can build your collection .
Sometimes adding links to your site for others can help with this practice .
Anchor text needs to be varied
Put your primary focus on developing content that is genuinely useful and can be used as a reliable resource , to encourage others to link to it .
Pay attention to the backlinks of your competitors .
Look at how they are linking and from where .
4 . Your content is not helping your site
Even if you get everything else right , without great content , your ranking wo n’t perform too well .
It needs to be high quality regarding delivering information that people want to read and it structured in the right way .
Here ’s where many sites fall down with content :
Content that does not go deep enough , is too short or is not unique will not work well .
Your content needs to have relevant keywords and be on information that readers love .
Your content is not converting
The most effective way to create relevant content is to create it for your buyer personas .
It will help them to relate to what you have to say and to consider becoming your customer based on this .
Once you have developed buyer personas , then create a model of how they will pass down your sales funnel and what information they may need during this journey .
What questions will they have and how can you help them best as they pass through each stage ?
Content that your prospects cannot relate to may appear to be working initially , but it needs to go deeper and be written to connect with your readers .
This is why it ’s important to use professional writers who know something about your topic .
5 . A purposeful keyword strategy
It ’s important to think carefully and do your research .
Using the type of keywords that are used when somebody wants to buy is important , however , using keywords that are far too competitive for how well established your site it , will backfire .
Keywords should also not be overused .
6 . Not checking Google analytics to make your decisions
Pay attention to the results you ’re getting for your chosen and applied keywords in Google Analytics .
You ’ll be in a better position to make informed decisions .
An approach you might want to consider is the use of the hub and spoke keywording where you have a central keyword in use and longtail keywords as the spokes .
The hub serves as the main page , and it also provides an index to your sub - topics that go into further detail about the different concepts .
You ’ll then be providing exhaustive information and also provide outstanding structured content with links .
The search engines will understand and should reward you for your input .
Your visitors should click through more , and you ’ll have better retention rates .
7 . Google has given you a penalty
There are many reasons why Google penalises sites and it ’s very important to check whether this has happened to your site .
It can happen for something as small as low - quality content to bad backlinks or not being mobile - friendly enough .
Even showing ads above the fold wo n’t work in your favour .
If you feel you may have been penalised , it ’s important to understand why that might be and put all your focus on rectifying the matter .
Summary
SEO changes all the time and it ’s currently heading in the direction of AI and quality .
There has been such a huge explosion in the production of content that it ’s important that Google still pulls out the best of it .
To keep up to date , visit your Google Analytics and look at other areas of your digital marketing strategy to monitor what ’s working and what is n’t .
For SEO to work in your favour , you need to be consistent and do n’t allow it to go stale .
I 'm still confused as to why they keep coming up with DRM .
If they were paying any attention at all , they can't believe it 's actually preventing piracy at this point .
Maybe the consultants keep feeding them lines on behalf of the DRM companies ?
White House and Pentagon distort the science to protect themselves and their corporate defense contractors from liability on water contamination
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Tuesday , Sept 23 , 2008
The Environmental Protection Agency says there is no need to act on the fact that a toxic rocket fuel ingredient , which has been proven to lead to a loss of IQ and an increase in behavioral and perception problems , has long been present in drinking water across the U.S .
In a remarkable reversal of it ’s position , the EPA , has ditched six years of effort into persuading the government that perchlorate contamination poses a serious risk to the public and should be regulated .
Perchlorate , has been found in at least 395 sites in 35 states at levels high enough to interfere with thyroid function and pose developmental health risks , particularly for babies and fetuses , reports AP .
The toxic chemical has also been found in lettuce and other foods .
It is used by defense and aerospace contractors in conjunction with the Pentagon in rockets and missiles .
Blogger Rick Attig at the Oregonian succinctly explains why the EPA has suddenly decided to back down and drop it ’s efforts to address perchlorate contamination :
It ’s obvious what ’s going on here .
The administration wants nothing to do with a cleanup that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars or more .
Nor does the Pentagon want to expose its friendly defense contractors to the costs of cleaning up the contamination they are responsible for leaving behind to seep into drinking water in at least 35 states and the District of Columbia .
Attig also points out that the Bush administration and the Pentagon are preparing to fix the science to justify not regulating perchlorate by setting the maximum contamination level at 15 times the figure the EPA suggested in 2002 .
( Article continues below )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The revelations first appeared in a Washington Post report Sunday , after the paper received a near final EPA “ preliminary regulatory determination ” document .
That document revealed that the government opted not to use a National Academy of Science formula for determining safe levels of perchlorate in drinking water , the model preferred by the nation ’s top scientists , instead opting to use a computer model developed by the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology .
No conflict of interest there then .
The report also revealed that the White House deleted references to scientific studies which highlighted the link between perchlorate ’s impact on thyroid function and an irreversible loss of IQ and perception in young people from babies to those in the 20s .
The document estimates that up to 16.6 million Americans are exposed to perchlorate at a level many scientists consider unsafe ; independent researchers , using federal and state data , put the number at 20 million to 40 million .
Robert Zoeller , a University of Massachusetts professor who specializes in thyroid hormone and brain development , told reporters that the government amendments to the EPA proposal “ have distorted the science to such an extent that they can justify not regulating ” the toxic chemical .
“ Infants and children will continue to be damaged , and that damage is significant . ”
Zoeller said .
Perchlorate is just one toxic horror readily found in the drinking water of people all over America .
We have previously reported on studies that have found that numerous pharmaceutical drugs , from antidepressants like prozac to sex hormones , currently contaminate the water supplies of millions .
In addition millions more are being being mass - medicated against their will in many water districts by way of sodium fluoride , which is classed as a poison , being added to water supplies without their consent .
The latest scientific reports have pointed to strong evidence of the waste chemical ’s link to disorders affecting teeth , bones , the brain and the thyroid gland , as well as lowering IQ .
Despite these facts , the government continues to aim to have 75 % of American water fluoridated by 2010 .
It is now clearly the responsibility of people everywhere to lobby representatives at the state and local levels to implement their own drinking water regulations in response to the combination of negligence , cronyism and downright criminal actions of the federal government on this matter .
Several states have already acted on their own .
In 2007 , California adopted a drinking water standard of 6 parts per billion for perchlorate , while Massachusetts has set a drinking water standard of 2 parts per billion .
Meanwhile other towns and cities across the country have voted to remove fluoride from their water .
Given that states like Pennsylvania have passed laws making it illegal to remove fluoride from a community ’s drinking water supply once such fluoridation is started ,
It is essential that action is taken on this matter before others follow suit .

A team of security researchers and academics has broken a core piece of internet technology .
They made their work public at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin today .
The team was able to create a rogue certificate authority and use it to issue valid SSL certificates for any site they want .
The user would have no indication that their HTTPS connection was being monitored / modified .
This attack is possible because of a flaw in MD5 .
MD5 is a hashing algorithm ; each unique file has a unique hash .
In 2004 , a team of Chinese researchers demonstrated creating two different files that had the same MD5 hash .
In 2007 , another team showed theoretical attacks that took advantage of these collisions .
The team focused on SSL certificates signed with MD5 for their exploit .
The first step was doing some broad scans to see what certificate authorities ( CA ) were issuing MD5 signed certs .
They collected 30 K certs from Firefox trusted CAs.
9 K of them were MD5 signed .
97 % of those came from RapidSSL .
Having selected their target , the team needed to generate their rogue certificate to transfer the signature to .
They employed the processing power of 200 Playstation 3s to get the job done .
For this task , it ’s the equivalent of 8000 standard CPU cores or $ 20 K of Amazon EC2 time .
The task takes ~ 1 - 2 days to calculate .
The tricky part was knowing the content of the certificate that would be issued by RapidSSL .
They needed to predict two variables : the serial number and the timestamp .
RapidSSL ’s serial numbers were all sequential .
From testing , they knew that RapidSSL would always sign six seconds after the order was acknowledged .
Knowing these two facts they were able to generate a certificate in advance and then purchase the exact certificate they wanted .
They ’d purchase certificates to advance the serial number and then buy on the exact time they calculated .
The cert was issued to their particular domain , but since they controlled the content , they changed the flags to make themselves an intermediate certificate authority .
That gave them authority to issue any certificate they wanted .
All of these ‘ valid ’ certs were signed using SHA - 1 .
If you set your clock back to before August 2004 , you can try out their live demo site .
This time is just a security measure for the example and this would work identically with a certificate that has n’t expired .
There ’s a project site and a much more detailed writeup than this .
To fix this vulnerability , all CAs are now using SHA - 1 for signing and Microsoft and Firefox will be blacklisting the team ’s rogue CA in their browser products .
Getting dumped usually begins after one utters " it 's not you , it 's me " or " i have too many other obligations " or " i slept with your best friend , and he / she 's better than you " ... this part varies and depends on the situation and the person dumping you .
And we all know that this part is a horrible and cruel event that initiates the changing of some of the best people in the world into annoying , irrational monsters .
And the only people that hurt more than this " dump - ee " are the loyal friends that must listen to this person sulk , whine , and eventual drown in their own sorrow .
I am the first to admit that sometimes I am a horrible friend ... so it 's no surprise that the last time I was forced to help a friend after she was dumped , I kept myself amused by ignoring the continous crying and , instead , analyzing the different processes she went through to cope with her situation .
From this , I could n't help but notice that the stages of my friend 's break up had an uncanny resemblance to The 5 Stages of Death .
Let me explain ... using my ( unnamed ) friend as an example :
The 5 Stages of Death as taught in school are ... 1 ) DENIAL2 ) ANGER3 ) BARGAINING4 ) DEPRESSION5 ) ACCEPTANCEThe 5 stages of Getting Dumped does n't necessarily follow the same sequence as The 5 Stages of Death , but for the sake of simplicity , I will explain them in this order anyway .1 ) DENIALThings that the dumpee might say while in this stage : " Nah , he / she was just having a bad day and did n't mean it , he / she will call me later to apologize " " You do n't know him / her like I do , there must be a reason for this " Description :
This stage usually follows right after one has been dumped , and is so shocked by this event that they go into a state of complete delusion .
It is also the time when one tragically turns into a " dumpee " .
At this stage , a person will justify why his / her partner just dumped them , usually coming up with the conclusion that their partner was deranged or " out of sync " on this particular day , and did n't mean a word he / she said .
Usually the truth is that the " dumper " had wanted to dump them all along , but never could find the courage or the right time to do so .
Still , the dumpee will battle against all logic and rationality , and come up with the idea that he / she knows the dumper more than the dumper knows him / herself , and conclude that the dumper will later realize what a big mistake he / she has made and thus ask ... nay , BEG , for the dumpee back .
Best Friend 's Solution : Inform the dumpee that they must still assess the situation logically .
The dumper most likely dumped the dumpee for a reason that they are fully aware about .
Denying the current situation in support of the dumpee will only make the next stage much more intense than it has to be .2 ) ANGERThings that the dumpee might say while in this stage : " I can't believe I ever loved that bitch / bastard ! "
" I hope he / she dies in a car crash " " I 'm going to pop his / her car tires " " He / She 's not going to away with this ... " " Where can I get some dynamite ?
" Description : This is the stage where the dumpee finally begins to feel some self - worth , and thus displaces his / her emotions against her ex through the form of unstoppable anger .
Sometimes the anger is irrational , sometimes it is psychotic , and many times it is dangerous for anyone in visible sight .
However , this stage can vary from anger expressed through words ( which is the safest ) or it can lead to hexes and / or * gasp * serious violence .
Beware of the dumpee in the Anger stage , he / she will say things or do things they do n't mean , and if you have the guts to stand up to an Anger - level dumpee , may God be with you .
Best Friend 's Solution : Sacrifice .
Stick it through and let your dumpee friend possibly tear you to shreds , because you know they do n't mean .
Tag along with their " revenge expeditions " but prevent them from doing anything that 's considered over - the - line ( your discretion , but you should probably stop them before they burn the ex's apartment down ) .
Lastly , be prepared to feel angry too while dealing with a friend in this stage ... because their anger may be very contagious ... or because they may be purposely jabbing you with verbal low - blows ... they enjoy it when someone feels just as shitty as they do .3 ) BARGAININGThings that the dumpee might say while in this stage : " Maybe he / she will take me back if I just give him / her what he / she wants " ( to the dumper ) " I 'll do anything , just give me a another chance ! " ( to the dumper ) " You do n't understand , I 've changed !
" Description : I like to also call this the Pathetic Stage .
This stage , to me , is the worst because witnessing people so clouded by their own desperation is repulsive and depressing .
The Denial Stage is one thing , but at least the dumpee 's in that stage do n't feign an epiphany in order to get their ex's back .
This stage is all about believing you can morph into an exact replica of what your ex wants - which is not possible .
You are who you are , and any change you make to suit your partner will be forced , and like a stretched elastic , you will only be most comfortable when you 're not being pulled to be different .
I admit people can change , but it wo n't happen while they 're in this desperate stage .
The irrational logic people possess at this stage compare to that of a baby's , and what 's worse is that it usually includes lots of pathetic begging .
Best Friend 's Solution : Instill similar logic to that of what was explained for the Denial Stage .
The dumpee is still in a state of denial , only it 's worse because they will be actively pursuing a confrontation with the ex and their plan is to mirror that love story movie they watched last week .
This is a confrontation you must stop .
How ?
well , first you ask the dumpee whether or not they mean what they 're going to say to their ex ... like , will they really change ?
Will they do all the things they promise ?
Inform them that they must be honest with themselves in order to ensure they 're not just being driven by desperate emotions .
Secondly , ask them whether or not they even really want to change .
Like , say they actually believe that they have the ability to change , do they even want to ?
Maybe there 's someone out there that likes them for who they are already , and changing really is n't necessary .
Lastly , remind them how difficult it was to be in the relationship , with all the unrealistic expectations .
Do they really want to change just to be in all that again ?
4 ) DEPRESSIONThings that the dumpee might say while in this stage : " Well , that 's it .
That was the one and I messed it up . "
" I can't sleep , I can't do work , I can't enjoy life .
What am I supposed to do now ? "
" If only I was just better with _________ " " I miss the way he / she smells " " I'm lonely " * Sigh * * Sob *Description : Much like the Anger Stage , the dumpee 's depression in this stage is contagious .
Be wary of the self - accusations the dumpee utters , you may see some of the faults in yourself .
A good chunk of this stage is spent sitting in a couch or lying in bed with unshaved faces ( guys ) or unshaved legs ( girls ) and dozens of take - out food containers scattered throughout the room .
Girls enjoy engrossing themselves in romantic comedy movies and tubs of Haagen Daz ice cream in this stage , while guys like to play video games until their eyes bleed , while eating a whole lot of pizza and beer .
Either way , it 's not a pretty sight .
However , of course , there are exceptions .
Some guys and girls deal with a dumping as healthily as they can .
They get up depressed , but they prop up quickly with a purpose , and they hide the fact that they 're upset and go about their daily lives as if it 's any other day .
But no matter how much they feign their happiness , there is always that one moment when everything around them seems to stop , and a jolt of depression hits them like a shot to the heart , and the rest of the day is ruined .
It 's important for dumpees in this stage to keep active and stay away from routines that will keep them prisoner for extensive periods of time .
Best Friend 's Solution : Be around the dumpee as much as possible .
Be light - hearted , but not too light - hearted as to piss them off with your happiness and jokes .
Ensure they do not fall into couch - mode .
Ensure that they are active .
Always listen to their depressing phone calls and be there for them .
Always remind them that it will get better with time , no matter how much they respond " I know , I know " .
Make them laugh .
Give them your point of view on the matter while being honest and caring .
This is a sensitive stage because they are vulnerable and much more open to your opinions than the previous stages .
Push too hard and you may push them to another stage - possibly Anger or Bargaining , where it is much tougher for you to get through to them .
5 ) ACCEPTANCEThings that the dumpee might say while in this stage : " I 'm feeling better now .
I 'm doing okay " " I 'm actually glad that he / she is out of my life " " Whatever , forget him / her .
" Description : This is the final stage of a dumpee 's tenure .
The stage in which the dumpee graduates from dumpee college and transforms back into a regular being in society .
No more " what if 's " , no more " I hate's " , and no more creating ass grooves on the couch .
All that 's left is the awful , painful , and liberating truth .
The dumpee has accepted what has happened , and is finally able to move on ... however , he / she is not yet necessarily ready for another relationship , but he / she is well on his / her way .
A lot of thanking of friends occurs in this stage , as well as a minor epiphany in which they look back and shake their head at how silly their actions were in the previous four stages .
If there was another relationship started from before this stage , ( most likely a " rebound guy / girl " that derived from the Anger Stage ) the relationship with this rebound guy / girl ends at this stage when it is realized that the feelings for this person were not really true feelings ( this part depends on the individual though , of course ) .
All is lost and all is gained in this stage , as the graduated dumpee finally can start with a new slate .
Best Friend 's Solution : No solution needed .
Just congratulate your friend on getting through it .
Maybe throw in a few " I told you so 's " for good measure .
Originally from my blog
Former Hollywood private eye Anthony Pellicano was sentenced to 15 years in prison Monday for running an illegal wiretapping operation that gathered information for a list of well - to - do clients , including celebrities , attorneys and business executives .
U.S. District Judge Dale S. Fischer condemned the once - famed investigator for “ reprehensible ” conduct that went on for many years as she handed down a sentence that significantly exceeded the five - year , 10 - month term recommended by probation officials .
“ He did this eagerly , sometimes maliciously , and with pride , ” she said .
As the judge spoke , Pellicano -- dressed in green prison garb and shackled at the ankles and waist -- remained mostly expressionless , leaning back in his chair with his chin propped on his hand .
The 64 - year - old sleuth , whose clients and victims ranked among Hollywood ’s biggest stars and most powerful executives , was convicted in two criminal trials earlier this year of 78 counts , including wiretapping , computer fraud and wire fraud .

When given a chance to address the court before sentencing , Pellicano said he had taken “ full and complete responsibility ” for his actions .
Assistant U.S. Atty Kevin Lally called the statement “ hogwash . ”
In court papers filed in October , prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Pellicano to 15 years and 8 months in prison , saying he was charged with , and convicted of , only a fraction of the crimes he actually committed .
By tapping phones and bribing public officials , Pellicano violated fundamental privacy rights of hundreds of people and chipped away at the integrity of public institutions , prosecutors contended .

“ He enjoyed every minute of it , ” Assistant U.S. Atty .
Daniel Saunders said at Monday ’s hearing .
According to prosecutors , Pellicano charged steep rates for information he got by listening to people ’s most intimate and personal conversations , often to give his rich and famous clients an edge in legal fights .
He bribed police officers to run names in law enforcement databases and phone company officials to get wiretaps running , prosecutors said .
With clients like Chris Rock and entertainment attorney Bertram Fields and victims like Sylvester Stallone and Keith Carradine , Pellicano ’s trial was a glimpse into the workings of Hollywood ’s innermost circles .

Although Pellicano represented himself at the federal trials -- leading to moments of farce and confusion -- he asked that attorneys get involved on his behalf for the sentencing .
Attorney Michael Artan had sought a more lenient sentence from Fischer , arguing that Pellicano ’s “ hardscrabble ” youth , work as a forensic audio expert for the government and financial struggle to provide for his autistic son in the years before his arrest were mitigating factors she should consider .
Fischer said she agreed that Pellicano ’s work for the government should be taken into account , saying she got many letters from law enforcement agencies about Monday ’s sentencing .
But she said it was far outweighed by the graveness of his crimes .

Similar pleas for leniency for Pellicano and his co-defendants have also been dismissed by Fischer .
Last week , the judge said Pellicano and two co-defendants should forfeit more than $ 2 million , an amount requested by prosecutors .
And last month , Fischer sentenced Pellicano ’s co-conspirator , attorney Terry Christensen , to three years in prison , rejecting a recommendation from probation officials that he be placed under house arrest .
Fischer rebuked Christensen , who was accused of conspiring with Pellicano to wiretap his opponents in trial , for “ marring ” the legal profession .

Pellicano ’s attorneys said they would be filing for appeal , citing what they called a “ cornucopia ” of issues to be raised about the trial .
The sentence was overly harsh compared with other wiretapping cases , they argued , accusing prosecutors of “ knee - jerk hyperbole . ”
Fischer , however , said she was unaware of any past case that was similar to Pellicano ’s extensive wiretapping and racketeering business .
The earliest Pellicano can be released is 2018 .
Pellicano has been credited for the time he has served since 2006 , when he was indicted after he finished serving 30 months for possession of explosives .

Four other defendants are scheduled to be sentenced next month .
Pellicano ’s troubles began in 2002 , when a reporter who wrote negative articles about former Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz went to authorities after she found a dead fish , a rose and a note saying “ Stop ” inside the smashed windshield of her car .
The reporter , Anita Busch , told the judge Monday that Pellicano ’s intimidation and wiretapping were like “ death by a thousand cuts . ”
The investigation led authorities to Pellicano ’s office , and it quickly snowballed into a wide - reaching probe that appeared would implicate some of Hollywood ’s biggest celebrities .

Pellicano ’s co-defendants included Sgt. Mark Arneson of the Los Angeles Police Department , computer technician Kevin Kachikian , and phone company employee Ray Turner , who were all convicted in jury verdicts in May .
They helped Pellicano earn millions by getting information on ex-spouses , business associates and opponents in lawsuits , prosecutors said .

Science correspondent , BBC News
A network of radio telescopes had been threatened by the cuts Leading scientists have said that physics research in the UK is suffering greatly because of a shortfall in funding .
They made their comments to BBC News at a meeting to respond to a government review published last month which concluded that physics was strong and had an excellent reputation .
At the meeting , the scientists said that a 25 % cut in research grants was damaging the long - term future of research .
They are concerned that university departments are having to cut back - with some having to halve in size .
And there are also worries that many young researchers are turning away from physics as a result of cutbacks .
Late last year , it emerged that there was an estimated £ 80 m shortfall in funding for physics research following the merger of two funding bodies to create the Science and Technologies Facilities Council .
Professor Brian Foster is a particle physicist at Oxford University .
He says his own department had to find savings of £ 1.5 m to cover grants that would no longer materialise .
" What we 're suffering from is down - sizing - essentially getting rid of people that are funded by STFC .
In my own department , we are having to halve in size , " he said .
Systems change Professor Foster is also European director of the International Linear Collider , a giant machine that would follow on from the recently opened Large Hadron Collider at Cern .
The STFC withdrew from the ILC project earlier this year .

" The decision is a very retrograde one , " Professor Foster said .
" We can not afford not to be involved in the future of particle physics .
Not to be involved in the future is clearly a death sentence in the not too distant future . "
Professor Foster rejects claims that he is guilty of special pleading for his particular interests , a view supported by the president of the Institute of Physics , Professor Jocelyn Bell Burnell .
" Of course you can't fund everything , but as president of the Institute of Physics I 'm taking an overview , " she told BBC News .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Her concern is that spending allocations were made secretively , without proper consultation .
That resulted in a Comprehensive Spending Review in government that was not favourable to certain parts of science .
The institute is keen that in future the process is more transparent and that there is much better consultation with scientists working in the field .
" We see some changes in those directions but I 've yet to be convinced that it 's going to work well enough , " said Professor Bell Burnell .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Professor Andy Fabian , president of the Royal Astronomical Society , said that grant cuts had led to young researchers leaving academia .
" We 're all still reeling ; it had its biggest impact on the young post - doctoral workers who 've decided , many of them , to do something else and that kind of drop is going to take many years to recover from . "
Future ' challenges '
In October , Professor Bill Wakeham , of Southampton University , carried out a review of the status , funding , university provision , school education , careers and skill - supply of physics in Britain .
Overall , his review findings were positive , but his report concluded that some " important challenges " had to be addressed .
The review recognised the considerable increase in science funding over recent years - rising from £ 1.776bn in 2001/02 to £ 3.235bn in 2006/07 .
But it said that physics ' share of this extra money was not as great as some areas because the government had made a strategic choice to push research funds towards health , the environment and energy .
A spokesman for the Department of Innovation , Universities and Skills said : " Public funding for science is now at its highest level ever and will increase from £ 3.4 bn per year this year to almost £ 4bn by 2011 .
" While detailed funding decisions are rightly a matter for individual research councils , over the past five years public funding for physics has increased from £ 460 m to £ 616 m . "

In secret agreement , Shell nets 25 - year monopoly on S. Iraq 's gas Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday November 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Royal Dutch Shell oil company and the Iraqi Oil Ministry have struck a secret , as - of - yet non-binding agreement that gives a monopoly over southern Iraq 's natural gas to the energy giant .
It marks the first time in over 35 years a Western oil company has played a major role in the country 's most lucrative industry .
Signed Sept. 22 and obtained by United Press International , the " Heads of Agreement " document -- basically a legal framework for a contract -- delegates
Shell sole access to the reserves for the next 25 years , with an option to extend that term .
Shell says the arrangement gives it exclusive rights to all natural gas runoff produced by oil exploration operations in the southern portion of the country .
However , like so many other major industrial contracts coming out of Iraq , the process used to reach an agreement is being questioned .
" There has n't been much transparency in this agreement , " said Ali Hussain Balou , chairman of Iraq 's Oil and Gas Committee , in a report by Reuters .
" They did not give a chance to another company .
We want to know why . "
" It is only a partnership , " Iraqi Oil Ministry spokesman Assem Jihad told UPI .
" There will not be a monopoly of the gas . "
The agreement does not allow Iraqi 's the first rights to the natural gas reserves .
Under its terms , state - run companies would capture " non-associated gas " discovered during oil exploration , which would then be sold exclusively to Shell for export .
In Sept. , several no -bid Iraqi oil contracts were supposedly canceled after coming under fire from US Senators .
Though the deals were allegedly scuttled , the companies were invited to bid for the contracts .
Almost immediately , Shell was announced to be on the cusp of becoming the first company to have major dealings in Iraq since the 1960's .
The " Heads of Agreement " document is just the next step in what AlterNet 's Nick Turse says is a secretly negotiated arrangement between the Pentagon and the UK 's most powerful oil company .
" The Pentagon 's Shell deal came during one DoD 's periodic petroleum benders - massive multi-day spending sprees where hundreds of millions or billions of taxpayer dollars are paid out to oil companies , " writes Turse .
" This one , on September 17th and 18th , netted Shell , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and seven other oil companies a grand total of over $ 1.5 billion . "
" These complex issues go ignored because they are viewed as so routine as not to be worth mentioning , but in any other context the confluence of guns , oil and billions of dollars would certainly raise eyebrows , " he concludes .
Despite the crushing 3 - to - 1 loss of a state constitutional amendment to confer civil rights on fertilized human eggs , the American Life League says it 's their " only option left " .
Despite a crushing 3 - to - 1 loss of a pioneering , but controversial , state constitutional amendment to confer civil rights on fertilized human eggs , an American Life League spokesperson made a curious slip of the tongue in a weird silver - lining statement about the organization ’s future plans to ban abortion .
The league ’s communications director , Katie Walker , offered this startling admission to the Christian newswire OneNewsNow.com about the league ’s future political strategies :
The idea of personhood in this movement is really the only thing , the only option left to us , and it ’s one of the best options and one of the most beautiful concepts I ’ve heard in a long time , she contends .
We ’re very excited about it .

Not so fast .
Why do that when , as Walker continues in a bizarre bit of revisionist Colorado political history , backpedaling can get the job done to downplay Amendment 48 ’s bruising 73 - 27 loss :
The fact that they got 27 percent of Colorado , which is historically a liberal state , is very hopeful , I think , she notes .
Huh ?
Historically liberal state ?
The one that George W. Bush carried in both 2000 and 2004 by sizeable margins ?
The state in which 53 percent of the voters approved Amendment 2 in 1992 , which would have barred civil rights protections for gay and lesbians until it was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court ?
The state that , until four years ago , held large Republican majorities in the General Assembly and its congressional delegation for decades ?
And the state where U.S. News and World Report noted that the Colorado personhood measure went down in flames 65 - 35 in conservative El Paso County , in the backyard of Focus on the Family and a host of state and national anti-abortion groups and conservative candidates , like Bob Schaffer .
As we reported Nov. 7 , the group Personhood USA is undaunted and claims to be picking up the mantle of Colorado for Equal Rights with plans to introduce the “ egg as a person ” measure to 16 states that opponents say would not only outlaw abortion , in vitro fertilization and stem cell research but also certain forms of contraception .

Believers Are No Better
By Dan Barker ( republished on Freethoughtpedia with permission from FFRF )
Are Christians more moral or successful than non-Christians ?
The Second Coming Of The Church by George Barna ( Word Publishing , 1998 ) , reports that they are not .
The author , a born - again Christian sociologist , is founder and president of Barna Research Group ( CA ) , which releases many meaningful survey results .
Although most of Barna 's book is a sermon to Christian ministers on how the church should regain its lost status , it does contain some frank statistics showing how the present church has " failed " in its mission .
The numbers are based on Barna 's own studies , and other national surveys .
Barna compares the behaviors and attitudes of Christians with Non-Christians ( see tables below ) and concludes : " We think and behave no differently from anyone else . "
Examples of the Similarity of Behavior Between Christians and Non-Christians
( from The Second Coming Of The Church , p 6 , partial list )
Have been divorced ( among those who have been married ) Born Again Christians : 27 % ; Non-Christians : 23 % Gave money to a homeless person or poor person , in past year Born Again Christians : 24 % ; Non-Christians : 34 % Took drugs or medication prescribed for depression , in past year Born Again Christians : 7 % ; Non-Christians : 8 % Watched an X - rated movie in the past 3 months Born Again Christians : 9 % ; Non-Christians : 16 % Donated any money to a nonprofit organization , in past month Born Again Christians : 47 % ; Non-Christians : 48 % Bought a lottery ticket , in the past week Born Again Christians : 23 % ; Non-Christians : 27 % Attended a community meeting on local issue , in past year Born Again Christians : 37 % ; Non-Christians : 42 % Examples of the Similarity of Attitudes Between Christians and non-Christians ( from The Second Coming Of The Church , p 21 , partial list )
Feel completely or very successful in life Born Again Christians : 58 % ; Non-Christians : 49 %
It is impossible to get ahead because of your financial debt Born Again Christians : 33 % ; Non-Christians : 39 %
You are still trying to figure out the purpose of your life Born Again Christians : 36 % ; Non-Christians : 47 % Satisfied with your life these days Born Again Christians : 69 % ; Non-Christians : 68 % Your personal financial situation is getting better Born Again Christians : 27 % ; Non-Christians : 28 %
Barna also sheds light on the definition of " God " that most Americans claim to believe in :
" Since more than nine out of ten Americans own at least one Bible , and 86 percent call themselves Christian , you might expect people to pay homage to the deity described and followed by the Christian Church .
In July 1997 , we asked a nationwide sample of 1,012 adults to describe the God they believe in .
Two out of three adults ( 67 percent ) said they believe that God is the all - knowing , all - powerful Creator of the universe who rules the world today .
The remaining one - third described their god as ' the total realization of personal , human potential ' ; or ' a state of higher consciousness that a person may reach ' ; or said , ' Everyone is God ' ; ' There are many gods , each with different power and authority ' ; or ' There is no such thing as God . '
The remaining 5 percent said they did not know . "
[ Pages 25 - 26 ]
According to Barna , a third of Americans do not really believe in " God " at all .
In spite of all the sermons about how belief makes a difference in life , the numbers show that Christians are not better off than unbelievers .
At least one born - again sociologist is honest enough to admit it .
Or did we know this already ?
Dan Barker is co-President of the Freedom From Religion Foundation and a former born - again minister .
Tigers at Thai Temple Drugged Up or Loved Up ?
Tourists flock to Thai tiger temple but some fear possibility of animal cruelty .
KANCHANABURI , Thailand , Dec 17 , 2008  --
Deep in the heart of Western Thailand , where the River Kwai weaves through the rich green jungle , the monks of the Wat Pa Luang Ta Bua Temple are beginning their day .
They walk through the town and collect alms from the locals .
But back at the temple for breakfast and prayers , it 's clear that this Buddhist monastery is like no other , for this handful of monks live with some of the deadliest animals in the world .
They call it the Tiger Temple , and its story is the stuff of fairy tales .
According to Abbot Pra-Acharn Phusit , a tiger cub orphaned by poachers was brought to the temple years ago .
The abbot cared for her and , as word spread , more people brought sickly and orphaned cubs to the temple 's doorstep .
Those cubs went on to have their own cubs , and nine years on there are now 34 tigers living here .
The Buddhists believe in reincarnation and the abbot feels that these tigers are his family .
As he told ABC News , " I think they are my babies : my son , my daughter , my father , mother .
If not in the present life , in the past life . "
Buddhists also believe that animals , like humans , are sentient beings .
" When the tiger angry , when you angry , it 's the same .
When you hungry , when the tiger hungry , it 's the same .
When you tired , when the tiger tired , it 's the same ! " the abbot explains .
He has used this understanding to raise some of the tamest tigers in the world , catapulting this small forest monastery into the international limelight .
Every afternoon , up to 1,000 tourists from across the world flock to the Tiger Temple for their very own personal tiger experience .
And what they see is unlike any American zoo exhibit .
Tiger Temple is hands - on , meaning visitors can pet the enormous cats and even hold their heads in their laps for photos .
" I 'd seen it on the tellie before I left Ireland , so I was dying to do it when I got here .
They 're just so beautiful , " tourist Georgina Stanley told ABC News .
Tiger Temple Draws Global Visitors
The abbot has hired more than 50 people to help care for his growing family and growing business .
Margarita Steinhardt first came to the temple from Russia seven years ago and is now one of the head caretakers of the tigers .
" Somebody mentioned that there is a monastery where you can come and look at the tigers if you want .
I did and they had little cubs at the time , " she said .
" As soon as I saw them and touched them I just lost myself to them .
I asked the abbot if I could stay , and he said all right , and then I stayed on and on and on . "
As with the rest of the staff , Steinhardt , who was studying conservation biology in Australia before arriving at the temple , had little prior experience working with animals .
The monastery has invited some animal experts to visit , including one famous Canadian trainer , but the animals ' daily care is left to the monks and other staffers rather than trained animal professionals .
They turn to local veterinarians when the tigers get sick .
Tourists visiting the Tiger Temple pay big money : anything from $ 15 just for entry , up to $ 50 for the very special photograph of a tiger with its head in your lap .
The temple says the money goes toward caring for the tigers ( each animal eats 13 pounds of meat a day ) and construction of " Tiger Island , " where it is hoped the tigers will soon move to live in larger enclosures .
Most of the tourists ABC News spoke with said it was worth every penny .
" This is the reason we came to Thailand , " gushed Anne , visiting from Australia .
" Actually lying next to it and feeling it breathing is just fantastic ! "
But not all of the visitors were convinced , and one even insinuated that the tigers , calmly sleeping in the sun while tourists petted and prodded them , were drugged .
" I do n't know what they 're on but they 've got to be on something if they 're laying around like that , " said Pete , also from Australia .
It 's a persistent rumor that the temple rejects .
" A Buddhist monastery seriously drugging an animal ?
It 's very dangerous to sedate animals .
When they come out from under anaesthetic they are very disorientated .
They will attack anything that moves , " Steinhardt said .
A recent report by wildlife organization , Care for the Wild ( CWI ) , went further , accusing the temple of illegally trafficking and mistreating the tigers , allegations that the temple emphatically denies .
Robyn Shelby , a law student from California , has been volunteering at the temple for seven months and told ABC News , " I have n't seen anything that I do n't agree with , and I am very big on animal rights .
These tigers are really happy and you can see that in their interactions with people . "
Tigers Tamed Starting at 3 Weeks Old
ABC News spent three days at the temple and did not see any evidence of drugging or mistreating the animals .
Steinhardt says that the temple has nothing to hide .
" If somebody wants to investigate the temple , come here , have a look , film what you want to film , nothing is closed off to the public here , " she said .
" People can go anywhere they like , they can see anything they want . "
The CWI report also raises concerns about the risks of close physical contact between the tigers and the tourists .
So far the temple has been lucky and no one has been hurt , but the abbot is well aware of the potential danger .
" I do n't want the accident , " he said .
" I do n't want my tiger to kill human who come to see him from far away , like United States . "
To help prevent such a disaster , the temple begins taming the cubs at just three weeks old .
They are taken from their mothers and brought to live with humans .
Tim Pollard is the lucky man in charge of rearing this latest batch of cubs .
He worked as a mounted policeman before becoming the tigers ' caretaker .
" I'm their mum once we take them away from mum , " Pollard said .
" We live in the cage with them . "
The abbot says his long - term mission is to find a suitable piece of land and release future generations of his cubs into the wild .
This is at odds with the temple 's practice of hand - rearing the cubs .
Tame tigers can never survive in the wild , but the temple says it has a plan .
" What they intend to do here is , once they 've got the area to release them , we 'll move into a breeding program where the new cubs will be taught to look after themselves and from thereon they 'll teach the next generation to fend for themselves and be released , " Pollard explained .
Not everyone is convinced , and some believe the temple is less about conservation than exploitation .
Edwin Wiek , the founder of Wildlife Friends of Thailand , says the temple 's mission is impossible .
" It 's never worked and it will never work , " Wiek told ABC News .
" TheTiger Temple is a zoo , nothing more and nothing less . "
Abbot Unconcerned With Criticism
There are those who argue that , for the moment , tigers may be better off in captivity than they are in the wild .
Mass deforestation and rampant poaching have left just 200 wild tigers in Thailand and 5,000 or 6,000 in the whole world , making them an endangered species .
Steinhardt believes the temple 's tigers raise awareness about the plight of tigers in the wild .
" Hopefully , people get to love them by seeing them so close and then they go bak and if they come across any tiger conservation activity , they 'll support them in the future , " she said .
The abbot seems unfazed by all the criticism .
" If they have the question , OK , come to see , come to see , " he said .
He believes people see what they want to see , and he welcomes skeptics and experts to come and spend time at the temple .
All of the employees of the temple asked ABC News to make it known that the temple actively seeks advice from people with expertise with wild animals and invites such people to spend time helping out and educating the staff .
For now , the abbot is content to continue pursuing his dream of repopulating the forests of Thailand with the descendants of his tigers .
As the Buddhist proverb goes , " if we are facing in the right direction , all we have to do is keep walking . "
Viagra may soon be history , for scientists at Oxford University are working on an electronic ���sex chip��� that can stimulate pleasure centers in the brain .
While the current technology is crude , the researchers say that the device could be perfected within a decade .
The prospect of the chip has emerged from progress in deep brain stimulation , in which tiny shocks from implanted electrodes are given to the brain .
For past few months scientists have been focusing on an area of the brain just behind the eyes known as the orbitofrontal cortex .
This is associated with feelings of pleasure derived from eating and sex .
A recent research survey , which was conducted by Morten Kringelbach , senior fellow at Oxford University ���s department of psychiatry , and reported in the Nature Reviews Neuroscience journal , found that the orbitofrontal cortex could be a ���new stimulation target��� to help people suffering from anhedonia ��� an inability to experience pleasure from such activities .
Stimulating this area can produce pleasure as intense as ���devouring a delicious pastry��� , he said .
His colleague Tipu Aziz , a professor of neurosurgery at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford , predicted a significant breakthrough in the science behind a ���sex chip��� within 10 years .
���There is evidence that this chip will work .
A few years ago a scientist implanted such a device into the brain of a woman with a low sex drive and turned her into a very sexually active woman .
She didn���t like the sudden change , so the wiring in her head was removed , ��� Aziz says .
The wiring remains a hurdle : Aziz says current technology , which requires surgery to connect a wire from a heart pacemaker into the brain , causes bleeding in some patients and is ���intrusive and crude��� .
By 2015 , he predicts , micro-computers in the brain with a range of applications could be self - powered and controlled by hand - held transmitters .
President Bush ducked out of harm 's way when a reporter threw his shoes at him during his farewell trip to Iraq .
The man , later identified as Muntadar al - Zaidi , a correspondent for Iraqi - owned Al - Baghdadiya television based in Egypt , shouted " this is the end " as he hurled them at the American leader .
The moment was captured from different camera angles and shows the president 's reaction afterwards .
Hadaka Matsuri : The Naked Man Festival
Japan …
Where else can you go to see thousands of loincloth - clad men soaking wet and frolicking around in the wintry night ?
The Naked Man Festival ( aka Hadaka Matsuri ) takes place in Saidaiji , Japan .
Men from all over the world flock to this small town to consume copious amounts of sake and run around in the middle of winter in their underwear .
They form small groups and run around the neighborhood chanting “ Washoi ! Washoi ! Washoi ! ”
The climax of the event takes place at exactly midnight , when two small wooden sticks ( shingi ) are dropped in the local temple .
The man who catches one will have a year of good luck .
These sticks are so highly prized , that the men clamber over each other to grab them , resulting in the strange tangle of bodies you can see here .

EVER since Franklin Roosevelt put the building blocks of the New Deal in place in his first 100 days in office , presidents have been subjected to the 100 - days test .
For that brief spell , they have a unique opportunity to put their imprint on history — a honeymoon period when the public gives them the benefit of the doubt and Congress defers to their popular mandate — and they squander it at their peril .
One of the most striking things about Barack Obama is that his 100 days seem to have already begun .
Mr Obama repeatedly insists that America only has “ one president at a time ” .
But since election day that “ one president ” seems to have been the junior senator from Illinois rather than the former governor of Texas .
Mr Obama has dominated the news with a relentless succession of carefully timed and often dramatic press conferences .
He has embraced his former nemesis by making Hillary Clinton secretary of state .
He has outraged the left by keeping Robert Gates at the Pentagon and making James Jones , a former NATO supreme commander who campaigned for John McCain , his national security adviser .
He has reassured the markets by putting Tim Geithner in the Treasury and appointing Larry Summers as his White House economics guru .
And he has made history by appointing Eric Holder as America 's first black attorney - general .
The Justice Department , which once spied on Martin Luther King , will now be in the hands of a child of the civil - rights revolution .
This is partly deliberate stagecraft .
Mr Obama and his advisers understand the importance of controlling the news .
They have also long been obsessed by presenting a “ presidential ” image of Mr Obama , a man who was nothing more than a state senator four years ago .
In June he appeared at a Democratic governors ' meeting in Chicago accompanied by a presidential - looking seal — an eagle clutching an olive branch in one claw and arrows in the other and emblazoned with the slogan Vero Possimus ( Yes we can ) .
The seal soon disappeared in a hail of ridicule .
In July he flew to Europe on a plane that looked remarkably like Air Force One and delivered a public address to hundreds of thousands of swooning Germans ( his plans to give his speech at the Brandenburg Gate were eventually foiled , so he had to make do with a lesser monument ) .
At the Democratic convention he gave a speech from a stage decorated with Greek pillars .
This is not a man who is uncomfortable with the trappings of power .
But much more important than stagecraft is the force of circumstances .
Americans are not only desperate for the change that Mr Obama offered .
They are desperate for someone to fill the vacuum at the heart of government .
The Bush presidency has been shrinking ever since his second - term agenda ( primarily Social Security reform ) collapsed in Congress and his remaining credibility was blown away in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina .
Mr Bush gave a rare television interview to ABC News this week , in which he expressed sympathy for the victims of the recession and lamented intelligence failures before the Iraq war .
But for most of the past year he has been missing in action — shunted to the sidelines by the McCain campaign and wheeled out only when the dismal economic news made a statement from the top man impossible to avoid .
A president who enjoyed a highly successful first 100 days of his own — including a big tax cut and a sweeping reform of education — has all but vanished .
The scale of the global economic crisis has also forced Mr Obama to adopt a quasi- presidential stance .
The bad news has been so relentless ( on December 1st the Dow dropped by 7.7 % on news that the economy is officially in recession ) , and the policy response by the powers that be has been so confused ( Hank Paulson first promised to buy up bad debt and then decided to take stakes in the banks instead ) , that America has sometimes seemed to be on the edge of a full - scale meltdown .
Add the terrorist outrages in Mumbai to the mix and the president - elect has had no choice but to seize the limelight .
The Bush administration has done as much as it can to reassure the markets that the transition will be seamless .
And Mr Obama has done as much as he can to show that he has the wherewithal to run the economy — giving regular press conferences on the subject and outlining his proposed stimulus plan .
A lame - duck Congress may even pass a version of that plan before Mr Obama comes to office .
FDR had to wait until his inauguration before unleashing an avalanche of legislation .
Mr Obama may be able to go one better and legislate from the “ The Office of the President Elect ” , as his new podium now has it .
The downside
The premature start to Mr Obama 's first 100 days is rife with risk .
Presidents inevitably use up their stock of political capital as they spend it .
They also gradually start to disappoint their friends and allies .
Mr Obama is shielded to some extent by his race and charisma .
But he has already sorely tested the patience of some of his most loyal supporters — first by appointing so many Clintonites to high office and then by keeping Mr Gates at the Pentagon .
Can it be long before the netroots begin to complain that they have been duped — that “ change ” is simply more of the same ?
And can it be long before the ravening beast that is the media tires of the story about the first black president and starts looking for Mr Obama 's feet of clay ?
Against that it must be said that the imprint Mr Obama is already putting on history is impressive .
He has demonstrated that he is self - confident enough to surround himself with big brains and strong personalities .
He is also signalling that he intends to govern pragmatically — changing America 's foreign policy by degrees , not precipitously , and focusing his energies on America 's miserable economy .
So far Mr Obama 's premature 100 days have gone better than anybody could have hoped .
I love to dumpster dive and not just the outside , but also picking around inside the big green monster , poking around with a stick and grabbing what appeals to me .
Over time I have picked up dressers , sofas , recliners , table and chairs , drill bits , ladder , side - tables , lamps , housewares , clothing and toys to name only a few .
Of course if you prefer the curb crawling only , that is fine as well .
And if you are new to all of this curb picking and garbage treasure hunting and unsure where to start .
Here are some rules that I live by :
Assemble the probe and mount in can
Now you 'll need that bit of wire .
You 'll need a soldering iron or a friend with one as well .
Cut the wire so that when it is stuck in the connector as shown , the total length of both the brass tube and wire sticking out past the connector is 1.21 " .
Get as close to this length as you can .
When you 've got your wire correctly sized , solder it into the connector keeping it as straight and upright as you can .
When it 's cooled , bolt or screw the assembly into your can .
Put the heads of the bolts inside the can and the nuts on the outside to minimize the obstructions in your antenna .
Your Done !
Connect your antenna to your wireless card or access point
To use your cantenna , you 'll need a special cable commonly called a " Pig Tail " .
The pig tail connects your wireless card or access point to you antenna .
One end of the cable will have a " N " Male connector ( just right for connecting your your cantenna ) , while the other end will have a connector appropriate to your card or access point .
For a good picture of a pig tail , take a look at :
http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi?PigTail
You 'll want to have a wireless NIC or access point with an external antenna connector .
Otherwise , you may have to hack into the one you have to hook up the cable .
I would n't recommend this unless you 're good with a soldering iron and electronics .
For this reason , I like the Agere Orinoco cards which have a nice antenna connector .
Pig Tails can be hand made if you have the right tools , but it 's probably easier to get a pre-made one .
Try :
Fleeman Anderson & Bird
Fleeman Anderson & Bird has a " cantenna kit " for sale that includes the connector and pigtail .
Choose one of the " cables " links from the menu and look towards the bottom of the list .

Antenna Systems
Hook up your cable , point the antenna at a friend's , and see how far you can stretch you network .
Be sure to let me know ( greg@turnpoint.net ) how it works .
This antenna has linear polarization .
That means that how you rotate the antenna will affect the strength of your signal .
Usually , you will want to put the connection straight down , but experiment with rotating the can while watching the signal strength on your PC to get the best performance .

Poll suggest changes in voter attitudes towards clean energy and global warming
[ social_buttons ]
Throughout his campaign , though more fervently towards the end of it , Barack Obama made it clear that investing in renewable energy and focusing on building a new energy economy would be a centerpiece of his agenda should he have won .
And now that he has , the results of a new Zogby poll suggest he ’s got the public mandate to do it .
According to the post-election survey , 78 % believe investing in clean energy is important to revitalizing America ’s economy .
Of those , 50 % said they strongly agree clean energy investment is vital to the nation ’s economic future .
Support for clean energy investment is particularly strong among younger voters – 87 % of those age 18 - 24 and 80 % of those age 18 - 29 believe this type of investment is necessary to help improve the U.S. economy .
While the vast majority of Democrats ( 96 % ) and independent voters ( 77 % ) view clean energy investment as a key means to boost the U.S. economy , more than half of Republican voters ( 58 % ) also said the same .
The results also indicate that most voters want their elected officials to focus on global warming – 61 % said they agree their elected officials should make combating global warming a high priority , an increase from 58 % of voters who said the same in 2006 .
Some of the most striking findings were that the desire for a greater political emphasis on global warming has increased 10 % among African American voters from 78 % in 2006 and to 73 % among Hispanic voters from 64 % two years ago .
The results of this poll suggest the political calculus has changed somewhat .
Pollster John Zogby says that clean energy has emerged as part of voter expectations for getting the economy back on track .
“ Support for action on global warming , already strong in the 2006 election , was even stronger in 2008 , particularly among young voters that are the future electorate , ” he said .
Commissioned by the National Wildlife Federation , the Zogby Interactive survey of 3,357 voters nationwide was conducted Nov. 5 - 6 , 2008 , and carries a margin of error of +/- 1.7 percentage points .

In a new television commercial for Nando's , a popular fast food chain , Evita Bezuidenhout , a kind of South African Dame Edna – but with more political bite – riffed on the changes in the country 's politics .
Bezuidenhout was " disappointed " to find only two similar sounding meal options for the same price , then deadpanned : " Why just A and C .
What about option B ?
You know we all know you can't just have A and C . "
Bezuidenhout 's wish is coming true today as the Congress of the People , an opposition party born out of the upheavals in the ruling African National Congress in the last year or so , is officially launched in Bloemfontein , one of the country 's nine provincial capitals .
The leaders of Cope , as the new party is already known , are high - level ANC dissidents unhappy with the forced resignation of Thabo Mbeki as the country 's president in August and the ascendance of the ANC 's trade union and Communist party allies .
They are especially riled by the leadership of Jacob Zuma , the current ANC president ( he unseated Mbeki for that post in December 2007 ) who is widely expected to become South Africa 's next president when elections roll around in April or May 2009 .
Zuma is associated with corruption and ethic and moral lapses .
There is no reliable poll data yet on Cope 's strength , but what most observers of post - apartheid South African politics note is that dissatisfaction with the ANC among the majority of South Africans ( largely black and poor ) is at an all - time high .
Whether that will translate into substantial support for a new opposition party ( with a not - so - new cast of characters ) , a drop in voter participation or something else is anyone 's guess .
That South African politics wo n't look the same after 2009 is for sure .
The results of last week 's special byelections to fill vacant seats left empty by resignations or expulsions of councillors in the wake of the split in the ANC may provide some clues about voter choices .
Though turnout was down ( ranging between a high of 23 % and a low of 8 % ) , the results were interesting .
Though a few byelections were held elsewhere in the country , the contest was largely confined to the Western Cape province , where 27 local government seats were up for grabs .
Here Cope took 10 seats in its first run at electoral offices .
The Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , a party associated with white " liberalism " , which controls the city of Cape Town ( in coalition with smaller parties ) , took nine seats .
The balance of seats were shared among the Independent Democrats – a party led by Patricia de Lille , a former Pan-Africanist Congress leader – and a number of other smaller parties .
It is true that the results should be approached with caution .
Outside the Western Cape , the ANC comfortably held onto seats in KwaZulu - Natal ( three seats , where in one instance the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Gatsha Buthelezi narrowly beaten ) , Gauteng ( two seats ) , Free State ( two ) and Northern Cape ( one seat ) .
But the byelections represent significant victories for Cope , a party with little campaign machinery in place that was formally launched only after those byelections .
The ANC may point out that it has historically been weak in the Western Cape ( in the short history of democratic elections ) due to the province 's ethnic make up and the history of white and coloured racism .
So the results may not be a surprise .
The results may also be skewed since 12 of its candidates were barred from running because of late registrations with the electoral commission .
But a closer look at the Western Cape results , as a local newspaper reports , indicates interesting voter swings .
The DA , a party usually associated with the white suburbs and growing voter support among the province 's coloured majority , took four wards from the ANC in head - to - head contests with the ruling party and another five seats in traditional ANC strongholds .
( The DA , incidentally , may still be swallowed by Cope 's emergence as a viable opposition party to the ANC 's dominance , especially among the white minority . )
As the events of the last two years in South Africa have proven , five months is a long time in South African politics .
But my sense today is that the ANC will probably emerge victorious in 2009 's general elections , though with a substantially reduced majority .
Many of the ANC 's problems are self - inflicted , but Cope will be the main reason for that decline .
The ANC 's reputation as custodians of democracy and freedom has been tarnished by the events of the last four years or so .
Cope has problems of its own .
Most significantly , it is hamstrung by its perceived link to Mbeki , the perception that it is the party of the black " middle class " as opposed to representing the interests of South Africa 's poor .
Most observers still complain that Cope does not have any clear policies and that its main difference with the ANC is its demand that the country 's president be elected directly ( currently , the majority party gets to do that ) .
Its support also has an ethnic edge to it .
Cope may triumph in a few provinces ( two for sure ; some predict that if the Eastern Cape goes to Cope they would probably govern through a coalition with the DA in the Western Cape , currently controlled by the ANC ) .
The ANC is expected to hold onto KwaZulu - Natal ( Zuma 's home base ) and will probably secure the Northern Cape .
A number of provinces will be highly contested : Gauteng ( Cope co-leader Sam Shilowa used to govern the province ) and the Free State are key among these .
The common sense logic on South African politics was that when the ANC would break , it would do so along ideological lines .
That has not happened .
What South Africans are getting at least is something not even envisaged until now : a competitive two - party system .
TimeWarner and Google have announced that starting today Google will make available millions of images from the Life Magazine photo archive .
The vast majority ( 97 percent ) of these images have never been seen by the public ( they were sitting around in physical envelopes ) .
These are hard - copy photographs that have been or are being scanned by Google and will be hosted by Google .
They will show up in Google.com and Google Image search results .
All these photos are available in high - resolution ( 5 and 6 megapixels ) .
The images will be free to use for “ personal and research purposes ” but will be digitally watermarked to prevent unauthorized or unlicensed commercial uses .
There are links to appropriate contacts for those who want to use the images commercially .
The images are labeled by subject (s ) and organized by decade and category .
They can also be searched by photographer and date .
In other words you can search for all images by a particular photographer in a particular year or decade .
Why would TimeWarner do this ?
The company merchandises the photography and there ’s a link on every page to a Time page where people can purchase the image :
Today about “ three million images ” are present , according to Google ’s RJ Pittman , and roughly seven million more will be added as they ’re scanned over time .
The photos are accessible through a dedicated front door but are also integrated into the core image search index .
Pittman said that working on this project for roughly a year has yielded benefits and improvements that will be integrated into Google image search as a whole .
He added that Google is looking to make image search , including the interface , better and suggested that the Life archive represents something of a preview of how Google image search could develop over time .
Google is n’t monetizing these images specifically at the present .
Postscript From Danny Sullivan : As Greg says , the images are free to use for personal or research purposes .
We know this , because that ’s what Google has told us directly .
It ’s also in the press release about the launch :
LIFE ’s Photo Archive will be scanned and available on Google Image Search free for personal and research purposes .
Copyright and ownership of all images will remain with Time Inc .
Unfortunately , an ordinary person using the photo archive probably wo n’t realize that images can be used for personal or research purposes .
Looking at any individual photo certainly does n’t make this clear .
They carry a Time copyright notification ( © Time Inc. ) that suggests they CANNOT be used for any purpose without explicit permission .
The FAQ page does n’t say personal use is OK .
It actually says something more restrictive :
What can I do with the images I find from the LIFE photo archive ?
You can browse and view the images you find , rate them , and see detailed information about the photographs .
There is also a link to buy image merchandise provided by LIFE .
Meanwhile , each photo has a “ Purchase image merchandise ” link that somewhat implies restrictions .
Hopefully , Google and Time will get things fixed .
Each image should clearly link to permissions information .
And Time ’s missing out by not selling options to buy images for reuse for commerical purposes .
Anyone interested in this and hitting that “ Purchase image ” option only gets a choice of buying a framed photo .
No contact info about how to use the photo in other ways , even if you ’re willing to pay .

UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Forrest Griffin will defend his newly - won 205 - pound belt against Rashad Evans .
Both fighters scored major upsets against former champions ( Quinton " Rampage " Jackson and Chuck Liddell , respectively ) to earn their spots atop the loaded weightclass .
It ’s the first time ever two former TUF contestants will vie for a world title .
And last but certainly not least , Jackson will take on Wanderlei Silva for the third time , hoping he can exact revenge after suffering two crushing defeats to " The Axe Murderer " several years ago while competing under the Pride FC banner .

After a week lecturing at Kansas State University and then in Kansas City , Missouri , I could not shake the feeling that what Kansas and Missouri need most is the equivalent of Radio Free Europe , which was so effective in spreading truth around inside Eastern Europe during the Cold War .
( Truth in advertising : during the late Sixties , I served for two years as substantive liaison officer between the RFE and Washington . )
So I was amused while still in Kansas to get a call from Mike Caddell of " Radio Free Kansas " asking me for an interview .
Broadcasting from rural northeastern Kansas , Caddell does his own part in spreading truth around .
Most of his fellow Kansans are malnourished by a steady diet of extreme right - wing media gruel that helps re-elect folks like see - no - evil Republican Sen .
Pat Roberts , who did Bush ’s bidding in " justifying " Bush ’s attack on Iraq when Roberts headed the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Caddell called me on Thursday , expressing excitement at the beginning of daily intelligence briefings of President - elect Barack Obama by the CIA .
Aware that I helped prepare the President ’s Daily Brief for Presidents Nixon and Ford , and that I conducted one - on - one PDB briefings of Reagan ’s most senior advisers during the latter ’s administration , Caddell wanted me to tape a telephone interview to run on his show this weekend .
He asked what I would tell President - elect Barack Obama if I were Mike Morell , the chief CIA analyst assigned to brief Obama daily .
What fun , I thought .
On more sober reflection , it seemed more useful to prepare questions of the kind President - elect Obama might wish to ask Morell , since the briefings are supposed to be a two - way street .
Obama is no shrinking violet .
Just the same , it may be useful to warn him not to succumb to the particular brand of " shock and awe " that can be induced by ostensibly sexy intelligence to color reactions of briefees , including presidents .
I have seen it happen .
The president - elect needs to start asking hard questions .
Now .
Here are some he might want to select for his next briefing :
1 . The lead story in Friday ’s New York Times undercuts the claims of Georgia ’s President Mikheil Saakashvili that he was acting in self - defense when he ordered his troops to fire artillery and rockets at the city of Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia .
The new information comes from international monitors of the highly respected Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and , oddly , is much closer to the Russian version of what happened .
Task :
A two - page memo on who started the fighting and why ?
Deadline : Monday
2. A National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) produced last November concluded that Iran ’s work on the nuclear - weapons part of its nuclear development program was suspended in mid-2003 .
National Intelligence Council director Thomas Fingar repeated that judgment publicly on Sept. 4 , 2008 .
I want to know how that squares  or does n’t  with the claim by neoconservative icon Norman Podhoretz , just hours after the NIE ’s key judgments were made public , that Iran is " hell - bent on developing nuclear weapons , " and why Podhoretz would go on to charge that the intelligence community was trying to " undermine George W. Bush . "
I notice , incidentally , that Defense Secretary Robert Gates has parroted Podhoretz ’s " hell - bent " phraseology , and that your boss , CIA Director Michael Hayden , has also publicly volunteered his " personal opinion " that this is so .
Task : A memo updating the judgments of the Nov. 07 NIE , as necessary .
Deadline : Nov. 14
3 . My aides have been telling me that , when speaking of the recent decrease in violence in Iraq , I have been mis-overestimating , so to speak , the success of the surge while mis-underestimating factors like the sectarian cleansing in Baghdad , the decision to pay Sunnis not to shoot at U.S. forces , and the decision of Muqtada al - Sadr to hold Shia fire pending the withdrawal of U.S. forces , which the Shia see as just a matter of time .
Task :
A memo ranking the reasons for the downturn in violence in order of relative importance .
It should address all these factors ; it should also explain why the U.S. has several thousand more troops in Iraq now than were there before the surge came and went .
Deadline : Nov. 19
4. Confusion reigns with respect to what is likely to happen when U. S. forces withdraw from Iraq .
That administration officials and U.S. Army generals know better what to expect than the Iraqis themselves strains credulity .
It has become increasingly clear that the Iraqi government and people believe they themselves can handle whatever comes once we depart , and that they consider the large U.S. troop presence part of the problem , not the solution .
Task :
A memo addressing why the Iraqis are more relaxed about a U.S. troop withdrawal than most U.S. officials and pundits .
Deadline : Nov. 21
5 . No outsiders have been able to prevail in Afghanistan .
What makes us think the U.S. can , no matter how many troops it chooses to recruit and insert ?
Task : A formal National Intelligence Estimate on prospects for Afghanistan .
Deadline : Jan. 9 , 2009
6. Nuclear nonproliferation : The UN ’s International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) recently proposed a nuclear - free zone as the best way to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
I want to know why this proposal never gets off the ground .
What are the obstacles ?
Task : A memo addressing this in historical perspective .
Deadline : Nov. 26
7. Peak Oil : the juncture at which demand keeps growing sharply while supply stagnates / recedes .
Some say we are already there .
What does the intelligence community think ?
Related question :
Is it likely that China , India and other key countries regard the invasion of Iraq as the first resource war of the 21st Century ?
Task : A memorandum addressing these questions .
Deadline : Dec. 1
8 . My advisers tell me that senior intelligence officials , including the principal deputy to National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell , have been briefing the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) , a creature of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Task :
Please ask McConnell to let my staff know what other policy advocacy institutes his subordinates have briefed .
Deadline : Nov. 10
9 . Mike , one of my aides has read carefully through the memoir of your former boss , ex-CIA director George Tenet , who speaks very highly of you .
The reader gets the clear impression you were one of his protégés ; he appointed you personal briefer to President George W. Bush .
Now two questions for you , Mike :
(1) Tenet told his British counterpart , Sir Richard Dearlove , on July 20 , 2002 , that the " intelligence was being fixed around the policy " of invading Iraq to bring " regime change " there .
( I refer , of course , to the so - called " Downing Street Minutes " of Dearlove ’s briefing of British Prime Minister Tony Blair on July 23 , 2002 . )
Did you know , Mike , the intelligence was being " fixed ? "
(2) Tenet also says in his memoirs that you " coordinated the CIA review " of Colin Powell ’s speech at the U.N. on Feb.
5 , 2003 .
Your comment ?
Nothing personal , Mike .
But with all due respect , you will be able to understand why I would like to start with a fresh slate .
Please inform your management that I would prefer a briefer untainted by the intelligence fiasco regarding Iraq .
Add that I am offended that they would send me someone so closely associated with George Tenet , the consummate " fixer " of intelligence .
And please do not forget to pass along to your successor the requests I have made .
Thank you .

State Attorney General Jerry Brown was " profoundly wrong " and " invented an entirely new theory " when he urged the California Supreme Court to invalidate Proposition 8's same - sex marriage ban on the basis that voters can't be allowed to overturn fundamental liberties , attorneys for the measure said Monday .
Brown 's reasoning would confer upon the state Supreme Court power it has never had , attorneys Kenneth Starr and Andrew Pugno said in their response to the attorney general 's December brief .
Brown " is inviting this court to declare a constitutional revolution , " the attorneys argued in the 29 - page response .
" His extra -constitutional vision is one of unprecedented judicial hegemony , a sweeping power vested in the least - democratic branch that overrides the precious right of the people to determine how they will be governed . "
Prop. 8 , passed by voters 52 to 48 percent in November , was a constitutional amendment that defined marriage as being between one man and one woman .
It was designed to overturn the state Supreme Court 's decision in May that called marriage a constitutional right and opened the way for an estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages in California .
Prop. 8 was challenged by opponents of the marriage ban immediately after the election .
But Brown , the state 's top lawyer , raised the stakes when he took the unusual step of refusing to defend the voter - passed initiative in court and instead challenged it on his own constitutional grounds .
Because the court 's May ruling equated a person 's right to marry with the rights to liberty and privacy , it should be recognized as an inalienable right that voters can't generally overturn , Brown said in his brief .
It would be " tyranny of the majority " to allow such rights to be taken away by a simple majority vote , he said , arguing that such an action is " inconsistent with the guarantees of individual liberty in the state Constitution . "
But Prop. 8 proponents said Monday that Brown was carving out law where none existed .
They argued that if the attorney general 's argument prevailed , it would be virtually impossible for voters to amend the state Constitution whenever the courts determined that inalienable rights were involved .
" The attorney general 's theory would fundamentally alter the role of the California judiciary , " said the attorneys for ProtectMarriage.com , the official proponents of Prop .
8 .
" If the ( initiative ) process is done correctly , once the Constitution is changed , that 's the document the judges work from , " Pugno said in an interview .
" This would put the court above the reach of the people when it came to amending the Constitution . "
But Brown refused to back away from his stand , arguing that concerns about individual rights can and should trump the initiative process in most cases .
" People have a right to amend the Constitution , " he said in an interview Monday .
" But when it comes to dealing with basic liberties , they should have to demonstrate a compelling interest that it needs to be done for the good of the community . "
In his brief , Brown did not challenge the validity of Prop. 8 itself , arguing against legal challenges by opponents who called the initiative a wide - ranging revision of the Constitution rather than a simple amendment .
He did , however , support the validity of the 18,000 marriages that took place while same - sex weddings were legal in the state .
Prop. 8 supporters have asked the high court to void those marriages .
In a reply brief filed Monday , San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera challenged the arguments made by Prop. 8 supporters , arguing that they want the court to issue " a blank check to discriminate - a judicial declaration of open season on disfavored minority groups . "
Herrera 's brief , filed on behalf of 15 local governments and seven married couples , is part of a flood of legal papers expected to be filed in the next few weeks as parties on both sides of the same - sex marriage debate rush to put their ideas in front of the state Supreme Court .
By Jan. 21 , attorneys both for and against Prop. 8 will file their final briefs , which the court will consider before a hearing on the case , which could come as soon as March .
Tough auto emissions standards backed by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist cleared an important obstacle when a state commission approved rules fiercely opposed by the auto industry but praised by environmentalists .
[ social_buttons ]
The Florida Environmental Regulation Commission voted 6 - 1 to adopt an emissions rule as a way of lowering the greenhouse gases .
The Florida rule to regulate carbon emissions from cars is modeled after the California rule which is still being held up in regulatory limbo .
But now that the panel has approved the rule , it will face much stiffer opposition in the Florida legislature , a venue that has traditionally been much friendlier to the auto industry lobby .
“ It will be tough , ” said Mike Sole the secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and an ardent supporter of the rule , in Central Florida ’s The Ledger .
Sole admits that there certainly are no guarantees it will make it through the legislature .
State regulators say tailpipe pollution from vehicles accounts for about 40 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions in Florida .
If the new rule is implemented , it could reduce greenhouse gas pollution from new cars and trucks by 23 percent by 2012 and 30 percent by 2016 .
Environmental organizations are providing strong support for Florida ’s new clean - car rule .
But can they stand up to the auto industry ?
Eric Draper with Audubon of Florida said , “ The automakers have been making cars that people do n’t want to buy and then putting their money into persuading regulators to not make cars cleaner . ”
Instead what Draper and other environmentalists want is to see the automakers “ take the money they are spending lobbying against Florida ’s clean - car rule and put it into developing cleaner cars . ”
A dozen other states besides California already have adopted tougher standards , including Washington , Oregon , Pennsylvania and New York .
Colorado and Arizona also have begun the adoption process .
Even if the rule does gain legislative approval , the Environmental Protection Agency is still refusing to grant a federal rule waiver that states need to put their greenhouse gas standards into effect .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Following are excerpts from a Reuters interview on Tuesday with Israeli opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu , who defended a Gaza offensive he said is aimed at ending a Hamas rocket threat on Israel .
Q. What will it take to do that ?
A . “ It will take military action .
It will take a united people .
In this case there is no difference between the opposition and the coalition .
We are united in this , to ward off this criminal assault on our people .
I do n’t think any country would allow its cities to be rocketed , its citizens to be bombed , its children to be killed and maimed by indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population .
It ’s just got to stop ? ”
Q . And yet civilians are being killed in Gaza ?
A. “ I think the international community is right to be concerned about the death of civilians .
This is precisely the point .
The Hamas is deliberately targeting civilians , deliberately hiding behind civilians .
That ’s a double war crime in itself , and very different from us .
We have tried to minimize civilian casualties .
When they fire into Ashdod , one of our biggest seaport cities , or into Ashkelon , another city , they hope to get civilian casualties , they hope to get a kindergarten , they hope to get a school .
When we go after the terrorists themselves , we hope not to have any incidental civilian casualties . ”
Q. Israeli ground forces are massing along the area , in an area where journalists are not allowed to be right now , where they ca n’t see what ’s happening .
Is n’t Israel afraid that a ground offensive will result in more civilian casualties , along with Israeli casualties , and bring international pressure ?
A. “ I am not going to get into the tactics .
There is a goal and the goal is to remove this Iranian - sponsored Hamas terrorist base which is right now hitting the suburbs of Tel Aviv ... the action that is required is something that removes this Hamas regime from the scene .
Ultimately we have no other choice . ”
Q. Is Israel seeking the removal of the Hamas government in Gaza ... in this operation .
Or is this something it is going to pursue further along the line ? ”
A. “ I think ultimately we need to do this .
Whether it can be done right now is something I do n’t think we should discuss here .
But it should be discussed because ultimately , if we do n’t do it , then Hamas will rearm itself ...
Hamas openly declared its goal to eradicate the state of Israel from the face of the earth . ”
Q . In the short - term , what needs to happen .
Can there be a ceasefire with Hamas ?
A. “ I think we want to make sure that the firing of rockets stops , but also that the capability to fire future rockets is also stopped . ”
Q . And how long can this take ?
Will it be weeks , days ?
A. “ I do n’t know .
I think what is important is the goal and not how long it takes to achieve . ”
Q . And if you ’re elected prime minister in the coming election , will removing the Hamas administration in Gaza be a key goal of your government ?
A. “ Yes . ”
Q . And how would you go about it ?
A. “ With all the means necessary to achieve it . ”
Q. What about the peace talks with the Palestinians , with Mahmoud Abbas , who has been critical of Hamas ?
Will you be pursuing peace talks ?
A. “ Absolutely .
I believe there are Palestinians who want peace and Palestinians who are terrorized by Hamas .
In fact , I think the people of Gaza are being terrorized by Hamas itself .
They ’re held hostage ... I mean Hamas ... puts its arms caches , its rocket launchers in dense civilian populations .
They ’re basically using these people as human shields ...
My goal is to defeat Hamas and to bring up peace with those Palestinians who want to live in peace . ”
Q . And can that be done without targeting Hamas leaders specifically ?
Do you see Israel targeting Hamas leaders in this operation ?
A. “ I do n’t want to get into the tactics .
I think this Hamas regime has to go . ”

Conclusion
I always advise people to use the design of their website to reflect their subject and personality .
This means having some freedom in the way their site looks .
However some layouts and designs work much better than others .
By studying what the most experienced content website publishers in the world do , you will greatly improve your chance of creating a website that works well .
I do n’t think you should use these research results stats to religiously map out your layout and typography , but I do think you should learn from them .
This is a summary of the key points :
In a closely watched move that may be followed across Wall Street , the top executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have decided to forgo their 2008 bonuses .
In doing so , they are giving up potentially tens of millions of dollars in payouts in a year that reshaped the securities industry .
After months of internal debate at Goldman , the seven top executives at the firm , including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein , asked the board 's compensation committee to grant them no bonuses .
The board approved the request on Sunday .
The executives will only be eligible for their base salaries , $ 600,000 for each .
A firm spokesman said the executives felt it was " the right thing " to do .
" While the firm has distinguished itself through many aspects of the crisis , we cannot ignore the fact that we are part of an industry that is directly associated with the ongoing economic distress , " the firm spokesman said late Sunday .
It is n't clear yet whether other firms will follow suit .
Spokeswomen at Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch & Co. said no compensation decisions have been made yet .
Morgan Stanley CEO John
Mack took no bonus in 2007 after the firm suffered a fourth - quarter loss .

Barack Obama moved yesterday to establish tighter emissions standards for cars , erasing any doubt about his plans to put the green agenda at the heart of his presidency .
Making his first appearance in the East Room of the White House , Mr Obama said he was instructing the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a Bush administration ruling that blocked a Californian request to impose more restrictive emissions limits on light vehicles .
It seems all but certain that the agency will give California a waiver to allow it to impose standards tougher than those set at federal level .
At least 13 other states , including New York and New Jersey , would likely follow suit .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The action clearly aimed to send the message that Mr Obama will be embracing environmental activism with an enthusiasm not seen at the top of US government for eight years , perhaps ever .
And he cast the message not just in terms of protecting the planet but also of national and economic security .
" It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs , " he said .
Initiatives to make the US energy - independent – an ambitious , if not pie - in - the - sky , goal – form part of the $ 825 bn ( £ 590 bn ) economic stimulus plan Mr Obama is trying to sell to Congress , against some resistance .
With yesterday 's televised ceremony , Mr Obama also sent a message to his allies that the years of America playing coy with international efforts to cap emissions and combat global warming , if not obstructing them , are over .
" We will make it clear to the world that American is ready to lead , " he said as his Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , was preparing to appoint a new special envoy for climate change .
The job will go to Todd Stern , who advised the former president Bill Clinton on global warming and was closely involved in the Kyoto treaty and Buenos Aires climate - change negotiations .
" The days of Washington dragging its heels are over .
My administration will not deny facts .
We will be guided by them , " Mr Obama said , a reference to the record of the Bush White House , which queried the link drawn by scientists between climate change and human activity and resisted calls for a global regime of emissions ceilings .
" For the sake of our security , our economy and our planet , we must have the courage and commitment to change , " Mr Obama said .
Tilting at Mr Bush has become a hallmark of the Obama presidency .
Even before his first week in office is over , he has repudiated his predecessor 's policies by moving to close Guantanamo Bay , reinstate curbs on torture , close secret CIA prisons and resume aid to family planning groups abroad that accept abortion .
On car emissions , he said Washington had " stood in the way " of California which has long taken the lead in the US in pushing to curb air pollution and emissions .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had written to Mr Obama on his swearing - in asking him to free California to move forward with the caps .
Mr Obama also ordered the transport department yesterday to issue by March the regulations that will help the car industry to meet a law passed by Congress last year designed to increase the miles - per - gallon standards on new cars in time for the 2011 model year .
The Bush administration had neglected to work on the specific regulations , without which it would have been difficult to enact the law , which intends to enforce a 40 per cent improvement in mileage performance in cars by 2020 .
Regarding California 's initiative , the Bush White House took the view that allowing states to set their own emissions standards would create a messy patchwork of regulations across the country , making it harder for the car manufacturers to comply .
Mr Obama 's decision was seen by some as creating a further burden for the struggling Detroit car industry .
California 's proposed restrictions would force car - makers to undertake a complete retooling to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent in new cars and light trucks by 2016 .
The Ohio senator George Voinovich said : " I am fearful that today 's action will begin the process of setting the American auto industry back even further .
The federal government should not be piling on an industry already hurting in a time like this . "
Environmental lobby groups praised Mr Obama .
" By beginning this process and directing [ the environmental protection agency ] to review the Bush administration 's lack of action , President Obama is turning the federal government into a force for positive change instead of a roadblock , " the Sierra Club said .
Meanwhile , the Senate last night confirmed Timothy Geithner , the former head of the New York City Federal Reserve branch , to be Mr Obama ’s Treasury Secretary in a 60 - 34 vote .
It had been one of Mr Obama ’s most troubled nominations : Mr Geithner had been criticised for failing earlier to pay some taxes , which have now been paid .

A Loudly Lurid Universe of Sci-Fi Pulp Illustration
The polished humanism of Star Trek ; the grungy mythology of Star Wars ; the uncomplicated flesh versus machine of Battlestar Galactica , the Terminator flicks , and the Matrix movies –- the future is all around us .
Bitter , sweet , dark , light :
You just have to pick your flavor for what you want tomorrow to be .
Norman Saunders for " Super Science Stories " , March 1950
But step back just a few decades and recall how looking at tomorrow was solely for newsstands and tawdry bookstores , which presented a loudly lurid universe of glistening glass tubes , gleaming chrome starships , and frantically faced diabolical scientists of the very - mad and very - bad variety .
Amazing Stories , Weird Tales , Wonder Stories , Astounding Science Fiction , Planet Stories , and the rest of their pulpy kin were secret sins , magazines smuggled home to be read under the covers by the dying batteries of a Boy Scout flashlight .
At the time , the artists working for the pulps were n’t considered anything but cheap creatives providing cheap entertainment for cheap minds .
But now we know what they were : visions of wonder , amazing vistas of the imagination , daring dreams of possibility , magnificent views of What Could Be -- but most of all we look back at what they did and recognize it for being truly magnificent art .
Unfortunately there is n’t enough time or space to touch on all of the artists who worked for the pulps that were printed between ( roughly ) 1920 ( something ) and 1950 ( something ) , but here ’s a quick guide to some of my own personal favorites , the artists who created a world of tomorrow when today was the only thing people could see .
Frank R. Paul - a bravery of scope
You have no choice but to be amazed by Frank R. Paul ’s Amazing Stories covers .
While the world was coughing and spitting behind the wooden wheels of Model T Fords or barely getting off the ground in biplanes , Paul created wonderful scientific dreams for a wonderful array of magazines .
His visions might have been built from the stuff of those early days –- tubes , wires , electrodes , sprawling cities –- but Paul had a bravery of scope : steamships flew through the sky , tidal waves cracked skyscrapers in half , dozens of alien vistas sparked the imagination , and scientists peered into the vastness of space with telescopes the size of mountains .
But whatever the size of his scope , Paul also filled his images with incredible detail , giving each one a reality that made his work like a functional blueprint for the future and not just an enticement to drop a nickel for an afternoon ’s amusement .

See the huge gallery of his art here .
Virgil Finlay - beauty , subtlety , and sensuality
Although he ’s also legendary for his covers , praise for Virgil Finlay has mostly been –- rightfully -- given out for his black and white interior work .
Sure he also had scope , drama , crazy dreams , and pulp outrageousness ... but to see a Finlay illustration is to be hushed into silence by its beauty , subtlety , and sensuality .
It 's easy to picture his images from Weird Tales hanging in the great galleries of the world .
The fact that much of his early work was for neglected and belittled pulps like Weird Tales is nothing short of infuriating .
( art copyright Virgil Finlay )
Hannes Bok - a playful madness
Hannes
Bok has to be on this stage of artistic magnificence as well .
Like Finlay , his style is refined and elegant , so much more than the pulps he worked for .
But he also brought a playful madness to his illustrations : a twisted kind of beauty to his figures and environments .
Looking at a Bok cover , you did n’t know whether what you were looking at was a dream or a nightmare , but you always felt that it was rich , glowing with passion , perfectly composed , and absolutely brilliant .
( art copyright Hannes Bok )
Wally Wood - a winking sense of whimsy
Another inspired illustrator , one that jumped from the pulps to pretty much every kind of illustration , is was the legendary Wally Wood .
It would take a book , hardly a short article , to just begin to touch on Wally ’s scope : Weird Science comics , romance comics , Tales From The Crypt , trading cards , Mad Magazine and even some hilarious smut , including the legendary Disney orgy poster .
Wood was n’t just prolific or insanely flexible : whatever he did , and he did a lot , he brought with him a precise touch , a winking sense of whimsy , but also a carefully balanced sense of drama .
You always knew you were looking at something Wood had done , and you were always amazed by it .
( art copyright Wally Wood )
Here is a nice article about Wally Wood - link .
Frank Kelly Freas - always compelling
When you mention Frank Kelly Freas many people immediately think of his iconic cover for Astounding Science Fiction , the one that Freas also did for Queen ’s album .
But when I think of Freas I prefer to think of the delightfully winking cover he did , also for Astounding , for Fredric Brown ’s " Martians , Go Home " .
That , for me , is Freas : there is perfect technique , marvelous color , ideal drama and composition , but there ’s also his marvelous sense of whimsy , a kind of bright and sparkling joy you can see in whatever Freas did , and what makes his work always compelling .
( art copyright Frank Kelly Freas )
Chesley Bonestell - the father of modern space illustration
There are too many fantastic artists who worked in the pulps to touch on them all on this little space , but I ca n’t go without at least mentioning Chesley Bonestell .
Even though you ca n’t really call Bonestell a ‘ pulp ’ artist , he deserves a bit of space for what he did for … well , ‘ space . ’
Considered by many to be the father of modern space illustration , Bonestell was the man who realized the scientific projections of Willey Ley and Wernher von Braun and the motion picture dreams of George Pal .
His paintings –- elegant , quiet , and magnificent -- were , for many people , not what the future could be , but what the future would be : a world of rockets and starships and men looking back at the earth from the distant moon .
( art copyright Chesley Bonestell )
Ca n't get enough of the glorious pulp art ...
Of course , there were plenty of " damsel in distress " illustrations in the vintage pulps - but these have a certain charm , too :
Check out the cover art on the right : this time it 's the hero who is in trouble , being ( saved ? ) by futuristic ladies :
International pulp art was quite spectacular , too .
Covers from Italian magazine " Urania " -
Glamorous ladies in dire futuristic situations :
French sci-fi paperbacks from the 1950s :
That ’s all for now but if there ’s a lesson to be learned it ’s that even though we might live in a world right next door to the future , there ’s still a lot the past can teach us .
Like , that real treasures and fantastic art can be found in places we might stupidly dismiss as simple , cheap , or pulpish .

MOSCOW  Georgian military forces fired more cluster munitions during their war with Russia in August than originally thought , and some of the weapons may have malfunctioned , causing civilian casualties when they fell short of military targets and hit Georgian villages , according to new research by Human Rights Watch .
The group said Tuesday that Georgia and Russia used cluster munitions extensively in the war , which began when Georgia launched a major artillery strike against South Ossetia , a breakaway Georgian enclave , prompting Russia to invade large swaths of Georgian territory .
Though Russia endured the brunt of international outrage for its conduct during and after the war , Georgia ’s actions in the conflict have come under increasing scrutiny .
While Georgia has strongly denied the findings , the new Human Rights Watch report , which was presented at the Convention on Conventional Weapons in Geneva on Tuesday , adds to a growing body of evidence of Georgian atrocities in the fighting .
Cluster bombs , typically anti-personnel weapons that eject dozens of explosive bomblets when detonated , killed as many as 17 civilians during the brief , bloody war and wounded dozens more , Human Rights Watch said in a statement .
In addition , many of the weapons on both sides failed , the statement said , scattering unexploded ordnance that has already caused casualties and poses a danger to civilians .

During his second marriage , a man we ’ll call Walter Logan had three or four affairs a year , every year , throughout the entire decade he and his wife were together .
When the Vancouver lawyer was n’t screwing around or indulging in pornography , he masturbated several times a day : at the office , on his lunch hour , or in the washrooms of his friends ’ homes when he was out for dinner .
Looking back now , the 43 - year - old says it did n’t even occur to him that he could be addicted to sex .
He was n’t hiring prostitutes or stopping in at massage parlours — behaviours that , in his mind , signalled a problem .
Seeking out women to fuck behind his wife ’s back , on the other hand , was more the pursuit of a “ sensual vacation ” .
Every time he slept with someone , though , Logan would end up consumed by shame .
He says he hated himself but he could n’t stop himself .
Georgia Straight editor Charlie Smith discusses why the Straight ran a cover story on sex addiction .
“ I ’d usually sleep with a person once , then would be so disgusted with myself that I would immediately cease all contact , ” Logan , who does n’t want his real name used , for obvious reasons , says on his cellphone .
“ I ’d drop them and vow never to do it again and would go back to my wife and try to be a better husband . ”
But the cycle continued : over and over , he ’d scour the classifieds in the Georgia Straight or pay for telepersonals to find a new , willing lover .
Finally , after his wife found a link on his computer to a site aimed at married men wanting affairs , Logan ’s double life started crumbling .
She left ; only when they were talking on the phone a few days later did he confess everything .
Not only had he cheated on her , but he was also unfaithful in his first marriage .
His second wife said to him : “ It sounds like you have an addiction . ”
With those words , everything clicked .
“ The moment she said that , the light went off in my head , ” Logan says .
Logan ’s sex addiction nearly ruined him .
Although he and his second wife tried counselling , their marriage ended earlier this year .
His relationships with many friends and family members ceased or suffered .
He is financially ruined .
At his lowest point , he was suicidal .
“ I was standing on top of a cliff , wondering if I should jump , ” Logan says .
“ And I almost did .
I had hurt my family so much , and I did n’t understand why .
I hurt my parents ; I hurt my siblings ” ¦I felt as if I ’d lost everything . ”
Two days later , Logan went to his first Greater Vancouver Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting .
“ Out of that despair I walked into that room and found hope , ” he says of the 12 - step program .
“ Unconditional love and support is what you get in those rooms . ”
Logan now describes himself as in his third year of recovery from sex addiction .
He stresses that he ’s not speaking on behalf of Sex Addicts Anonymous but , rather , wants to tell his story so that people in similar situations know that they can get help .
Sex addiction has been in the media spotlight lately , thanks largely to David Duchovny , the actor who happens to play a sex - obsessed writer on TV’s Californication and who went into rehab for the condition in August .
In the movie Choke , based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk , Sam Rockwell plays a medical - school dropout who goes to sex - addict recovery groups , looking to hook up .
New York author Susan Cheever has just released Desire : Where Sex Meets Addiction ( Simon & Schuster ) , a book about her own relentless need for love and sex .
And the theme of sexual addiction shows up in Quebec filmmaker Lyne Charlebois ’s Borderline .
Sex addiction is also the object of plenty of mockery .
Even Logan says he used to joke that if you had to have an addiction , sex would be the best .
“ It ’s the worst , ” he says now .
“ It eats away at your soul .
You live with shame .
You live a double life .
I could not stop it .
I knew that one day I would get found out .
It ’s a soul - killing disease . ”
Hattiesburg , Mississippi–based counsellor - psychologist Patrick Carnes introduced sex addiction to the public when he wrote Out of the Shadows : Understanding Sexual Addiction in 1985 .
In 1992 , he released Do n’t Call It Love : Recovery From Sexual Addiction , a book that features results from a study he conducted of 1,000 addicts and their families .
According to Carnes , three to six percent of the U.S. population is addicted to sex .
He ’s not talking about those who merely have a strong sex drive .
“ It is a compulsive behavior that completely dominates the addict ’s life , ” Carnes explains on his Web site .
“ Sexual addicts make sex a priority more important than family , friends , and work .
Sex becomes the organizing principle of addicts ’ lives .
They are willing to sacrifice what they cherish most in order to preserve and continue their unhealthy behavior . ”
Sex addiction is n’t marked by a single type of behaviour , but can include compulsive masturbation , compulsive use of pornography and prostitution , compulsive heterosexual and homosexual relationships , exhibitionism , voyeurism , indecent phone calls , child molestation , violence , rape , and incest .
“ Even the healthiest forms of human sexual expression can turn into self - defeating behaviors , ” Carnes says .
In Do n’t Call It Love , Carnes reveals the results of questionnaires filled out by 752 male and 180 female sex addicts , most of whom had been admitted for treatment to a Minnesota hospital .
The others had spent at least three years participating in a 12 - step program for sexual addiction .
Of the people included in Carnes ’s research , 63 percent were heterosexual , 18 percent were homosexual , 11 percent were bisexual , and eight percent were unsure of their sexual preference .
Ninety - seven percent of addicts reported that their sexual activity resulted in the loss of self - esteem , while 96 percent reported feeling guilt or shame , 91 percent said they had feelings of hopelessness , and 90 percent said they were acting in ways that collided with their values .
Carnes found that 42 percent of sex addicts were also dependent on alcohol or drugs , and 38 percent had eating disorders .
Eighty - one percent of sex addicts reported a history of sexual abuse .
Logan has the same story .
When he was 10 , he and a friend were both molested by a stranger while they were playing in the woods .
( “ He used the whole ” ˜I ’m looking for my puppy ’ kind of stuff , ” Logan says of the man . )
After he was sexually assaulted , things changed .
His grades dropped and he started getting into trouble .
Then he started to masturbate .
“ Before I even reached puberty , I was very compulsive , to the point where I would masturbate until I injured myself — four , five , six times a night . ”
¦I started using masturbation at a very early age to try and escape my feelings . ”
¦With addiction , you ’re trying to run away from yourself , your fears , anxieties , sadness : whatever emotions you do n’t want to feel . ”
By the time he reached his 30s and was arranging to meet women in hotel rooms , affairs gave Logan an emotional , if temporary , high .
“ I felt so unworthy as a person ” ¦that I needed the person to want me , ” he explains .
Caveh Zahedi also used sex as a means to dull negative feelings .
In 2005 , the San Francisco–based filmmaker released I Am a Sex Addict , a movie for which he still gets both fan mail and hate mail .
The twice - divorced 48 - year - old , who ’s now remarried and has a new baby , went to his first Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting in 1991 after years of paying prostitutes for oral sex .
“ When I heard other people speak [ at the meetings ] , I recognized my own pattern , ” Zahedi says in a phone interview .
“ The more they did it , the more they felt compelled to do it .
I wanted to stop but never could .
It was a lonely , isolating thing for me ” ¦I realized that for me it almost always happened when I was upset about something , when I was sad or angry . ”
¦Sex addicts sexualize their anger .
It ’s how you deal with your pain . ”
Zahedi , who went to SAA meetings for several years but now relies on yoga and meditation to counter troubling emotions , says making the film was part of his healing process .
“ People think sex addicts are people in raincoats , really sleazy , when they ’re just normal people , people you see every day .
I wanted to fight the stereotype . ”
Sex addiction crosses all socioeconomic , educational , racial , and sexual - orientation lines , but one thing that is common among addicts is a sense of shame , says Doris Vincent , a certified sex-addiction therapist and registered psychologist who , in addition to treating people at her Recovery Path office in Edmonton , counsels people throughout Alberta , B.C. , and the Northwest Territories by phone .
“ They feel very , very sad about their behaviour , ” Vincent tells the Straight .
“ They want to stop .
They do n’t want to continue .
They love their families and do n’t want to lose them .
But they cannot stop the behaviour despite repeated attempts , and it ’s a constant disruption in their life . ”
Sex addiction can also be seen as a chemical addiction , according to Carnes , because dopamine , the brain ’s pleasure - creating neurochemical , is released during orgasm .
Dutch neuroscientist Gert Holstege revealed in a 2003 Journal of Neuroscience study that brain scans taken during orgasm resemble those taken during a heroin rush .
Marnia Robinson , a former lawyer turned “ sacred sex ” researcher , explains the neurochemical phenomenon of addiction on her Web site , Reuniting .
“ Passionate encounters leading to sexual satiation over - stimulate the pleasure / reward center in the primitive brain , triggering temporary ” ˜hangovers ’ , ” Robinson writes .
“ Let ’s look at what goes on in the brain during sex and orgasm .
Although you think everything happens between your legs , the sensation of orgasm actually originates between your ears , in the form of chemical messengers and the receptors they bind to .
These neurochemical changes take place in the limbic system , or ” ˜mammalian brain ’ .
The mammalian brain ” ¦is the seat of emotions , desires , drives and impulses .
“ However , addiction is not just about the highs .
Over time , an addiction creates a chronic lowering of dopamine levels . ”
¦This sense that ” ˜something is missing ’ is the basis of addictive cravings .
At the same time , the addict experiences a much higher than average response to triggers related to his particular learned behavior . ”
¦In other words , his overall state seems to be flattened ” ¦while his reaction to triggers related to his addiction is more pronounced .
This may be because such triggers signal an opportunity for relief from the misery of low dopamine . ”
Robinson stresses that Reuniting is n’t aimed at addicts , but she says she was surprised to discover that many were visiting the site .
“ I thought , ” ˜Come on , guys , this site is about sacred sex .
We do n’t want to talk about porn , ’ ” Robinson says on the line from Ashland , Oregon .
“ But I could see that these really wonderful men were asking , ” ˜How did this happen ?
I ’m not a pervert .
I do n’t understand why I ca n’t turn it off . ’ ”
Some believe sex addiction is linked to low dopamine levels in the brain ’s limbic system , which is the seat of emotions .

Vincent also believes the brain — and not weak moral character — plays a role in sex addiction .
“ If it is an addiction , there ’s no choice , ” Vincent explains .
“ The limbic system is driving it . ” ¦The brain focuses on the things the neurochemical system needs .
The primitive part of our brain takes over . ”
According to Vancouver doctor Gabor Maté , the distinguishing features of addiction are compulsion , preoccupation , impaired control , persistence , relapse , and craving .
In his latest book , In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts : Close Encounters With Addiction , Maté explains that the roots of sex addiction can be traced to childhood , and whether someone was sexually abused or lacked love and nurturing .
“ In a person with addictive behaviors , the orbitofrontal cortex and its associated neurological systems have been tricked from childhood onward into valuing false wants above real needs . ”
¦Hence , the desperation of the behavioural addict , the urgency to have that want answered immediately , as if it really were an essential requirement , ” Maté writes .
“ The so - called nymphomaniac , the female sex addict , is not addicted to sex at all , but to the dopamine and endorphin rewards that flow from the feeling of being desired and desirable . ”
Sex addiction falls into a grey area when it comes to diagnosis .
It does n’t show up in the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the most trusted guide to psychiatric disorders , but it is being considered by a work group on non-substance - related addictions for inclusion in the next edition , which comes out in 2012 .
Sex addiction is n’t defined on the Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine ’s Web site , nor was a representative from the society willing to be interviewed .
However , the society did invite Vincent to speak on the role of sexual - abuse - survivors ’ groups in the treatment of sex addiction at its most recent conference , which took place in Vancouver on October 31 and November 1 .
A study in the August 2004 issue of the Philadelphia - based Journal of Sex Research questioned the validity of sex addiction .
Authored by John Bancroft — then director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction — and researcher Zoran Vukadinovic , the report described “ compulsive sexual behaviour ” and “ sexual addiction ” as “ currently fashionable concepts ” .
“ At this time , both concepts are of uncertain scientific value , ” Bancroft and Vukadinovic wrote , noting that nymphomania ( excessive sexual desire in women ) and satyriasis ( the same in men ) used to be popular labels .
In their study — titled “ Sexual Addiction , Sexual Compulsivity , Sexual Impulsivity , or What ?
Toward a Theoretical Model ” — Bancroft and Vukadinovic interviewed 31 self - described sex addicts ( 29 men and two women ) .
“ Subjects were asked whether they found themselves trying to resist the urge to act out or whether at the time it was something they genuinely wanted to do , ” they wrote .
“ Eleven men and one of the women indicated that they tried to resist , but most of them did not give a convincing description of resistance . ”
However , the authors did find a relationship between negative mood and sexual interest .
“ All but 4 of the 29 men and both women reported an increased likelihood of acting out in states of either depression or anxiety or both , ” they noted .
Plus , forty - five percent of the addicts reported a state of mind while carrying out sexual acts that Bancroft and Vukadinovic say could be regarded as a form of dissociation from reality .
Addicts noted these sensations : “ not conscious of reality ” , “ zoning out ” , and “ numb ” , and sex feeling “ like euphoria — like cocaine ” .
Despite the Kinsey research , many health professionals maintain that sex addiction is as real as it is devastating .
Paulette Tomasson , a West Vancouver–based nurse , clinical counsellor , and certified sex-addiction therapist , says that the condition is rife with misinformation .
“ When people hear ” ˜sex addict ’ , they think ” ˜pedophile ’ , ” Tomasson tells the Straight .
“ That ’s a completely different thing .
“ I just had two new clients yesterday , ” she continues .
“ Both were men .
Both had been to many other therapists .
The older client was in tears because he ’s been trying to work on this for about 15 years now , and everyone wants to normalize it .
They say , ” ˜It ’s just what men do .
All men go to prostitutes . ’
Excuse me ?
That is not true . ”
Tomasson , who gives educational seminars for counsellors interested in becoming certified sex-addiction therapists , says a half - dozen people might show up .
“ It ’s really quite sad , ” she says of the dearth of services available .
“ Therapists will say , ” ˜ Oh , I do n’t have any of that in my practice . ’
Well , if you ’ve seen 100 people , you have at least three to five who have sex addiction . ”
She also stresses that with the proliferation of porn on the Internet , the prevalence of sex addiction will only increase .
Tomasson , who treats men and women , says that looking at suggestive images on - line changes the wiring in people ’s brains .
People ’s eyes are not used to looking at light directly for long periods of time .
By staring at a steady stream of light , people become “ like deer in headlights ” and go into a state of “ startle ” .
“ When you ’re on the Internet and in startle , then up comes an image and it makes you aroused , those images get burned into your brain , ” Tomasson explains .
“ There might be a pop-up of something like an adolescent who ’s compromised .
I ’ve had people say , ” ˜I ’ve never been attracted to adolescents in my life .
But after being on the Internet , I ca n’t get it out of my mind . ’
“ So the Internet shifts the arousal template , and it becomes very difficult to then find the same arousal with a real human being .
All of a sudden , people become aroused by something illegal or immoral . ”
¦The Internet is known as the crack cocaine of sex addiction .
“ I used to think Craigslist was for used furniture , ” she adds .
“ Now I know it ’s the most popular place for people to pick up prostitutes .
When I walk down the streets , I see a whole different city now . ”
Like Tomasson , Vincent sees the Internet as the greatest catalyst for sex addiction .
“ Besides the anonymity , accessibility , and affordability , one of the dangers of the Internet is that we see images our brain is not prepared to handle . ”
¦They stay in your brain .
I have clients come to me trying to get rid of them . ”
Although the Internet is a potential menace to people who ca n’t control their desire , it ’s also a place where addicts as well as their spouses and family members can find support .
Web sites like No-Porn.com and RecoveryNation.com have helped people understand the affliction .
Recovery is possible .
Tomasson , who heads Addiction Counselling and Resources Limited , recommends one - on - one therapy in conjunction with 12 - step programs .
( Information about Greater Vancouver Sex Addicts Anonymous is at www.saavancouver.org/.)
There are some places in Canada that take in - patients , including Toronto ’s Bellwood Health Services .
Sometimes Tomasson will request a client abstain from sex and masturbation for three months .
“ They look at me like they ’re going to die , ” Tomasson says .
“ They go through a physical withdrawal process , just like with caffeine .
But they find what their natural rhythm is with sexuality . ”
¦Most have been compulsive and have used sex as a reward to self - medicate , to fend off emotions that they do n’t like or that make them uncomfortable . ”
Clearly , unlike with alcohol addiction , abstinence is n’t realistic when it comes to sex .
Vincent agrees that the first step to recovery is “ sobriety ” , and that it takes a minimum of 30 days to come out of an addictive state .
She says that one of the goals is for addicts to abstain entirely from sex in the short term , then from compulsive behaviours over the long term .
From there , people can move into healing and look at underlying personal issues , including trauma they may have experienced as a child or adult .
Addicts must also learn what it means to have a healthy sex life — including aspects like boundaries , trust , intimacy , openness , honesty , and communication .
Prevention is possible too , starting early in life .
“ Children need good information about sex in an age - appropriate way , ” Tomasson says .
“ Children are exposed to porn on the Net today by the age of seven .
They are sexualized earlier and earlier in our society by ” ¦fashion and are exposed to sexualized images on TV , music videos , and all forms of media .
So , basically , it is about helping children process their feelings , have safe coping methods for stress , and , of course , loads of love and support . ”
Logan still goes to Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings regularly and sees a counsellor .
He says he ’s hit rock bottom and is starting his life from scratch .
“ But I do n’t think I ’ve ever been happier , ” Logan says .
“ Life now is a lot more precious .
I ’m learning how to be a much better person , to live a life of honesty , to be accountable to my friends and family . ”
He ’s not in a relationship and is hesitant about dating .
“ I have to be prepared to tell them my story , and it ’s not an easy thing to hear . ”
A source in this story asked for anonymity .
A Georgia Straight editor verified his identity .
Barack Obama has tapped Mary Schapiro , “ a veteran and diligent regulator , ” to head his Securities and Exchange Commission , said Floyd Norris in The New York Times .
That ’s good news for those who want the SEC to “ recover from what must be the worst year in its history . ”
Outgoing chairman Christopher Cox just “ condemned ” his agency ’s failure to uncover Bernard Madoff ’s massive fraud , but its lax regulation was “ a subject of scorn ” before Madoff .
Cox is “ awful , ” said Gary Weiss in Seeking Alpha , but with all Obama ’s talk of “ change , ” his selection of a “ career bureaucrat ” like Schapiro leaves me “ utterly flummoxed — and disgusted . ”
She may be experienced , but the chances of her “ instituting real , meaningful , desperately desired change ” in the securities industry is close to nil .
“ A more workable approach to securities law ” is much needed , said the Los Angeles Times in an editorial , but new powers for the SEC are n’t .
The agency ’s failure to catch Madoff , even after receiving “ multiple allegations of fraud , ” is due to its not enforcing laws already on the books .
Sure , “ blame too little enforcement , ” said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
The SEC ’s budget has more than doubled since the collapse of Enron , and its enforcement staff is at “ modern record ” highs .
But it still failed to nail Madoff , because the SEC is n’t good at catching “ determined and crafty ” fraudsters .
The only ones to figure out Madoff ’s con were the “ private research shops ” the SEC wants more control over .
“ Regulators are never going to catch every financial shenanigan before it blows up , ” said Justin Fox in Time .
But Schapiro could make things better by splitting the SEC and its fellow regulators into two agencies , one focused on consumers and investors and one on the health of financial institutions .
Maybe Schapiro should n’t try to fix the SEC , but instead “ shut it down and replace it with something better . ”

What 's Wrong with Deleveraging ?
By Arnold Kling
In a previous post , a commenter asked a good question about what bothers me about deleveraging .
Deleveraging in the nonfinancial sector means that consumers buy less on credit and firms use less debt financing .
That is obviously necessary , because we had excess leverage before .
Deleveraging in the financial sector means that banks and bank - like institutions try to hold fewer risky long - term assets and issue more risky long - term liabilities .
That is a bad thing , in my view .
Within the financial sector , rapid deleveraging is a beggar - thy - neighbor situation , in which firms destroy one another ’s liquidity .
The demands for collateral to back credit default swaps are a prime example .
However , the financial sector became excessively leveraged in recent years .
So what is the solution ?
I believe that the solution is to aggressively shut down insolvent institutions .
In the case of banks , you pay off the depositors and try to make the best deal you can for other creditors ( usually , that means selling the bank and writing down some its debt ) .
The strategy of shutting down institutions is not perfect .
It scares the bleep out of people who have bonds or preferred stock in similar institutions .
It makes it hard for banks to raise capital .
So you have to give them some capital forebearance–let their capital ratios get low , as long as you think they are not hiding some really big losses somewhere .
There is no perfect way to get rid of excess leverage in the financial sector .
But I think that getting rid of weak institutions works better than propping them up .
When you prop them up , they continue to participate in the beggar - thy - neighbor process that is the ugly side of financial sector deleveraging .
In Russia , until a few years ago when Putin ’s acolytes decided the option was creating altogether too many headaches , voters had the option of foregoing all the available choices and instead checking a box on the ballot marked “ none of the above ” .
The option had some actual teeth as well : in case more voters opted for “ none of the above ” than for any individual candidate , the elections had to be done over .
( That ’s what let the government to eventually shut down the option , after a couple of embarassing reruns in regional governor ’s elections . )
Judging on some recent opinion polls , there ’s plenty of Europeans who would love the option .
Take Britain and Hungary .
Ambivalence in Britain
An ICM poll in Britain last week showed the opposition Conservatives still in the lead , but in one that ’s sharply down from 15 to 5 points in a month ’s time .
The Conservatives are at 38 % , down 7 , and Labour is at 33 % , up 3 .
“ Today ’s poll is in line with other recent surveys , making it clear that the opposition has crashed back to reality after a triumphant summer , and David Cameron is not seen as the man to revive the economy , ” the Guardian comments .
For some time now , Gordon Brown has been receiving plaudits internationally for his handling of the economic crisis , but so far the British voters had not seemed to be in a forgiving mood .
The expected crisis bounce for Brown had remained elusive : the voters see he ’s not doing too badly with the crisis , but also blame him for its eruption in the first place .
After all , he ’s been in charge of the British economy for 11 years now .
It ’s also hard to underestimate just how fed up many people with Labour , New or otherwise , more than a decade since it came to power .
And so Labour ’s ICM polling had been stuck at 30 - 32 % since the party conference in September , while in other polls it had crept up to 35 - 36 % .
Even after this new uptick , Brown still is n’t exactly wooing the public .
33 % of the vote , or even 35 - 36 % , is fairly anemic .
For comparison ’s sake : in September 2006 , when Tony Blair was forced by his own party to announce he would resign within a year , Labour was polling 31 - 32 % .
When it suffered a decisive election defeat under Neil Kinnock in 1992 , Labour received 34.4 % .
What the polls appear to be showing , then , is as much David Cameron ’s weakness as any revival of Labour strength .
The ICM poll shows his conservatives at their lowest ebb since February .
Other polls this month have pegged their support at 37 - 42 % , the lowest since April .
For sure , Dave ’s slick and smart and media savvy , and he has been the pragmatic leader the Conservatives had been lacking so sorely throughout the Blair years .
But he also does n’t really seem to have any substantive grip on what agenda the Tories can offer for dealing with the crisis .
Simon Hoggart , the parliamentary sketch writer in the Guardian , wittily chalked out the problem :
David Cameron wanted to establish that Tory economic policy was completely different from Labour economic policy .
And that when it all goes horribly wrong over the next year , it wo n’t be his fault . [..]
So at precisely 10.05 , [ timed meticulously for the news broadcasts , ] he strode out onto the stage . [..]
And it was pretty apocalyptic stuff .
The government ’s plans were “ useless ” .
They should n’t just suffer , “ they should be punished for a generation for their economic crimes , ” he said .
We were going to be borrowing some £ 4,000 for every family .
Britain would be in the red until 2016 , “ and that is on an incredibly optimistic forecast .
Labour has spent it .
Labour has blown it . ” [..]
Where one begins to lose him is when he retreats to generalities .
He says that the first step to economic recovery is “ to fix our broken society ” .
He makes it sound like something you ’d pop on the back on an envelope .
“ Buy milk , phone babysitter , fix broken society ” as if it was a DVD player that needed repairing .
You can imagine the conversation : “ Oooh , I dunno .
I suppose I could fit you a new motivator , but frankly , with prices what they are , you ’d be better off buying a brand new society … ”
Then we got onto “ empowering individuals ” , “ coherent public service reform ” , the “ new , post - bureaucratic age ” and “ unlocking the potential of private and voluntary sectors ” , and we realised that he had little to offer except intangible Blairish aspirations .
But it did n’t matter .
The news channels had long moved on .
Unsurprisingly , the ICM poll data shows Cameron has not yet inspired confidence in his ability to be a serious , decisive statesman :
In particular , voters are sceptical of the opposition ’s ability to handle the economy .
Asked to compare Cameron and Gordon Brown on a series of characteristics , Brown pulls ahead by 11 points as the person most likely to get the economy back on track .
He scores 35 % against 24 % for Cameron . [..]
Brown [..] leads by four points , 32 - 28 , as the leader most likely to take the right decisions when the going gets tough . [..]
Voters also think Brown is the most honest leader – leading 26 - 21 . [..]
Brown is also seen as the leader most likely to understand people ’s concerns – his advantage is 28 - 25 .
Note , though , that on all these counts , between 40 % and 53 % of the respondents thought neither leader fitted the bill .
It ’s on the question of honesty that voters reject the two main party leaders most strongly .
Disaffection in Hungary
That ’s still chickenfeed compared to the scale of problems here in Hungary though .
The advent of the economic crisis is overwhelming an already intensely beleaguered government , which for a few years now has been the target of mass demonstrations and violent riots .
Adding to the sense of collapse are strikes that felled the national railways and hit the Budapest airport this month .
The charismatic , conservative opposition leader Viktor Orban , however , in his turn seems to have little more to offer .
He does not appear to have a credible alternative plan for handling the economic crisis , beyond the promises of tax cuts that have been the hallmark of his platform for years .
No wonder , then , that the polls show two things .
Those who can still bear to make a choice massively go for Orban ’s Fidesz over the ruling Socialists .
But the largest group of Hungarians does n’t have a preference either way anymore .
They ca n’t even bring themselves to express a preference .
in a poll commissioned by the weekly HVG , Fidesz is at 62 % among decided voters , and the Socialists at 28 % .
In a separate poll conducted by Tárki , 61 % of decided voters opted for Fidesz while just 26 % preferred the Socialists , while a Szazadveg - Forsense poll had Fidesz ahead among decided voters by 57 % to 32 % .
But looking at all the voting age respondents yields a different picture .
Then , Fidesz ’s support translates to just 35 % in the Tarki poll and 24 % in the Szazadveg - Forsense poll , and that of the Socialists to just 16 % according to Tarki and 14 % according to Szazadveg - Forsense .
In short , about 50 - 60 % of the respondents in these two polls preferred neither of the two dominant parties .
With the two other parliamentary parties ( the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats ) each well below 5 % , that means that around half the Hungarian population wo n’t express a preference for any of them .
By ways of comparison : in Britain , the latest YouGov poll found all of 21 % of respondents answering they would n’t vote or did n’t know for whom ; the last Ipsos - Mori poll I could find this level of data online for , back in April , had 23 % of respondents refusing or answering they did n’t know or would not vote .
The Hungarians seem significantly more disaffected from their political parties collectively .
This kind of disaffection is striking in a country where the polarisation between left and right is so high that it has pitted neighbours and family members against each other , and where the choice to be “ with us or against us ” has for years now been formulated as a question of whether you ’re even a true Hungarian or not .
( Fidesz , for example , in 1998 notoriously called on its voters to wear the national flag on their lapel in the days before the election , implying that anyone who did not vote Fidesz was not a patriot . )
It ’s an indication of how deep the sense is that the country is at the end of the road .
A massive 84 % of the respondents in the HVG poll said things are moving in a bad direction in Hungary – and that included a majority of Socialist voters .
“ None of the above ” would stand a good choice right now , I think .
¶ When the Office of Management and Budget balked at the American occupation authority ’s abrupt request for about $ 20 billion in new reconstruction money in August 2003 , a veteran Republican lobbyist working for the authority made a bluntly partisan appeal to Joshua B. Bolten , then the O.M.B. director and now the White House chief of staff .
“ To delay getting our funds would be a political disaster for the President , ” wrote the lobbyist , Tom C. Korologos .
“ His election will hang for a large part on show of progress in Iraq and without the funding this year , progress will grind to a halt . ”
With administration backing , Congress allocated the money later that year .
¶ In an illustration of the hasty and haphazard planning , a civilian official at the United States Agency for International Development was at one point given four hours to determine how many miles of Iraqi roads would need to be reopened and repaired .
The official searched through the agency ’s reference library , and his estimate went directly into a master plan .
Whatever the quality of the agency ’s plan , it eventually began running what amounted to a parallel reconstruction effort in the provinces that had little relation with the rest of the American effort .
¶ Money for many of the local construction projects still under way is divided up by a spoils system controlled by neighborhood politicians and tribal chiefs .
“ Our district council chairman has become the Tony Soprano of Rasheed , in terms of controlling resources , ” said an American Embassy official working in a dangerous Baghdad neighborhood .
“ ‘ You will use my contractor or the work will not get done . ’ ”
A Cautionary Tale
The United States could soon have reason to consult this cautionary tale of deception , waste and poor planning , as troop levels and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan are likely to be stepped up under the new administration .
The incoming Obama administration ’s rebuilding experts are expected to focus on smaller - scale projects and emphasize political and economic reform .
Still , such programs do not address one of the history ’s main contentions : that the reconstruction effort has failed because no single agency in the United States government has responsibility for the job .

Five years after the invasion of Iraq , the history concludes , “ the government as a whole has never developed a legislatively sanctioned doctrine or framework for planning , preparing and executing contingency operations in which diplomacy , development and military action all figure . ”

A Swedish research group has discovered a new mechanism for cell division in a microorganism found in extremely hot and acidic conditions .
The results of the research offer insights into evolution , but also into the functioning of the human body .
The new mechanism for cell division was discovered in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius , a microorganism found in hot springs in Yellowstone National Park .
The organism is a member of the third main group of life on earth , the Archaea .
Archaea , like bacteria , are unicellular organisms but in terms of evolution they are more closely related to another main group of living things , the eukaryotes ( humans , animals , plants , fungi , etc ) .
Strangler proteins
Until now little was known about the proteins that control cell division in the Archaea .
With the use of immunofluorescence the researchers determined the location of these proteins in the cell and in doing so discovered that three proteins play a crucial role in the cell division of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius .
Once the whole chromosome has been replicated , these three proteins form a band - like structure over the cell equator .
One chromosome is then found on each side of this band .
The band then squeezes the cell into two so that two new daughter cells are formed .
At first it looks like mitosis , as discussed in many a biology lesson .
However , mitosis is the process whereby the chromosomes are distributed between the two daughter cells .
Cell division is the process whereby the two daughter cells are separated .
It is striking that these cell division proteins are not related to other proteins known to be involved in cell division .
Some of the proteins in the new type of cell division are similar to proteins in other eukaryotes that have a completely different function .
The study shows that the proteins involved in cell division in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are related to the so - called ESCRT proteins .
In eukaryotes , and therefore also in humans , these proteins are involved in protein transport within the cell .
It has recently been shown that the HIV virus makes use of the ESCRT transport system to escape from the host cell .
Studying the process of cell division in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius could therefore lead to new insights into the processes involving ESCRT proteins , such as HIV particle release .
Evolution
Some theories suggest that in evolutionary terms the Archaea are the predecessors of eukaryotes .
This is confirmed by the fact that genes involved in cell division in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are related to eukaryotic genes .
In one way or another , these organisms are related to us humans .
The study shows that this resemblance is possibly somewhat closer than at first thought .
Among other things , microbiologist Thijs Ettema has taken a closer look at the resemblance between the cell division proteins and the ESCRT proteins .
This research was partly financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research .
Thijs Ettema , member of the research group , received a Rubicon grant from NWO in 2006 to gain experience abroad .
SYDNEY , Australia  Australia announced plans Monday to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 5 to 15 percent by 2020 , angering environmental groups that had lobbied for much deeper cuts .
In a policy statement , the government said the final target would depend on whether developed and developing nations , including major emitters like China and India , could agree to binding reductions under a new United Nations climate treaty next year .
If the world acts together to forge deep cuts , Australia will reduce its emissions by 15 percent of its 2000 levels over 10 years starting in 2010 .
If there is no agreement , Australia will cut emissions by 5 percent over the same period .
No matter what the short - term target is , the government said it was committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent from 2000 levels by 2050 .

With the Courts Striking Down the Federal Government 's Monopoly on Supplying Medical Marijuana , Private Growers Are Bullish on Pot 's Commercial Potential
Eric
Nash can barely contain his excitement waiting to hear from Health Canada whether he can start growing marijuana for 250 patients now that the Federal Court of Appeal has struck down the government 's monopoly on supplying medical marijuana .
That would be just the start .
He says there are tens of thousands more who are ailing across the country , clamouring for his organic B.C. bud .
" There is a great opportunity here for the government to collect significant tax revenue currently being lost to the street market , " enthused Nash , whose company , Island Harvest , has cleared the industrial security regulatory hurdles and meets the standards set by Ottawa to grow cannabis legally .
" Our vision is to have a sustainable commercial agriculture operation , " he said .
" There 's no reason we can't achieve that .
Look at the number of compassion clubs , look at the number of people using marijuana to relieve a headache or premenstrual cramps ! "
On Oct. 27 , the federal government lost its appeal of a 2007 Federal Court ruling that the government 's policy allowing licensed producers to only grow marijuana for one sick person was unconstitutional .
That decision was stayed pending the appeal .
The appeal court agreed with the trial judge -- the medical marijuana scheme was constitutionally deficient -- and refused to suspend the impact of their ruling to give the government time to amend the regulations .
Health Canada spokesman Phillipe Laroche said the department was still studying the ruling and had not decided on its response .
More and more research is supporting previous anecdotal evidence that cannabis may have a wide range of therapeutic uses , from the treatment of Alzheimer 's , depression , glaucoma , epilepsy and cancer to HIV / AIDS , hepatitis and ADD / ADHD .
Its most ardent promoters say cannabis may be an addition to the modern pharmacopoeia that rivals Aspirin in the breadth of its applications .
Until now , the government 's program has artificially depressed the medical market by making it difficult for patients to qualify , supplying what many consider poor - quality marijuana and restricting qualified licensed growers to supplying only one patient .
Doctors have been reluctant to prescribe marijuana , claiming they have no guide on dosage or the usual pharmaceutical medical studies to rely on .
Nash said three serious analyses of the medical marijuana market in the last eight years give an idea of its scope and potential .
While Health Canada has issued roughly 2,500 exemption permits over eight years , the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2000 estimated the number of self - medicating marijuana patients to be 1.9 per cent of the population .
A Price Waterhouse report prepared for Health Canada two years later concluded it was more like four per cent of the population , and a report in 2004 by a member of the federal government 's advisory committee on marijuana suggested the reality was closer to seven per cent .
The four - per-cent model would put sales at more than $ 400 million annually , Nash said .
More optimistic projections say the medical market , including ancillary products such as vaporizers and paraphernalia , could be as high as $ 20 billion .
Currently , Ottawa sells maybe $ 1 million a year worth of the pot produced in a Manitoba mine , and compassion clubs across the country sell about $ 10 million worth of cannabis products .
By far the vast majority of patients who need marijuana as a medicine continue to buy their drugs from the black market -- that 's one of the fundamental reasons behind the Oct. 27 court ruling .
The government adopted the Medical Marijuana Access Regulations ( MMAR ) and accompanying bureaucracy in 2001 .
It has modified it since then in the face of judicial warnings that it was constitutionally inadequate .
The federal court decision promises an economic boon immediately for the hundreds of legal cannabis producers and increased opportunity for many others .
Nash said it was good news for both the consumer and producer .
Restricting growers of medical marijuana results in a huge gift of revenue to organized crime .
Stephen Easton , an economist at Simon Fraser University and with the Fraser Institute , has done the most respected work on the size of the domestic pot industry .
In the 1990s and even throughout the early part of this decade , he said , tons and tons of Canadian marijuana flooded into the U.S. market .
People were backpacking across the border with as much weed as they could carry , or kayaking across with a stash of bud worth as much as emeralds .
Between 1990 and 2000 , the Canadian pot market doubled in size , fuelled primarily by increased hydroponic production .
Nationally , Canadians apparently spent $ 1.8 billion toking up -- just shy of the $ 2.3 billion we burned on tobacco .
By 2006 , when he did his calculations , Easton said the numbers indicated a provincial wholesale market of $ 2.2 billion .
You could increase that to $ 7.7 billion retail if consumers paid top dollar for their bud .
That dwarfed any other B.C. agricultural product .
The result on the street was easy to see : a proliferation of gangs duly documented by the RCMP , as every crook plucked what Easton called " the low - hanging fruit . "
With the tightening of the border post - 9/11 , smuggling now is more the purview of the very organized and the very desperate .
U.S. authorities have charted the rise of their own domestic production as American states relaxed enforcement and sentencing -- pot production in California rivals Canada 's total output .
And with the north - south route to market becoming problematic , more B.C. bud has moved east either to be sold or to find a less monitored area of the border before turning south .
By far the biggest factor in the marijuana market in recent years , however , has been the revolution in production -- the ease , predictability and , most importantly , the portability that has come with advances in indoor cultivation .
B.C. bud ruled in the 1990s when the underground marijuana trade was responsible for keeping afloat many small communities buffeted by resource - market gales , but these days be you in Barrie , Ont. , or Joe Batt 's Arm , N.L. , you can easily obtain good seeds and fail - safe equipment and within a few months be producing marijuana to rival B.C. 's best .
Some estimates in the 1990s suggested as much as 50 cents of every dollar generated in some Kootenay towns could be traced directly to pot .
Former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Celerino Castillo III spent 12 years in the USDA infiltrating Manhattan drug rings , destroying jungle cocaine labs and training anti-narcotics agents .
The climax of his career was pulling the curtain back on drug - smuggling by the Nicaraguan Contras with links to Lt. - Col .
Oliver North and the CIA .
Mexico is again considering legalization because of the violence and social upheaval caused by illicit drug trafficking , and Canada should be headed down the same path , he says .
So should South America and the U.S .
" The corruption is everywhere -- every month we arrest a law enforcement official , every month , " he insisted , " whether it 's a border patrol agent or a customs agent or a DEA agent or an FBI agent .
We arrest a law enforcement officer once a month .
It 's huge .
The amount of money is just so big .
' I have a mortgage to pay , I have to send my kids to college . '
That 's always the excuse . "
He shakes his head .
He explained that in his state , drug couriers once arrived with suitcases of cash to deposit in local banks : " Now they buy the banks .
Especially now with this upheaval .
Who else has the ready cash ? "
He laughed .
" But that 's actually how they 're money - laundering today -- they buy a bank , " Castillo added .
" There 's no way we can keep up . "
In retirement , Castillo has become a featured speaker for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , an association of former police , corrections and judicial officers who want to change drug policy .
" There 's more production , more product and more of everything than there ever was .
The war on drugs does n't work , " he said .
Dana Larsen , the former NDP candidate , who stepped down during the federal election when his recreational drug use was publicized , is promoting a new Vancouver compassion club .
Larsen , who used to be the leader of the B.C. Marijuana Party , thinks the time has come to move into the medical field .
" I think there 's enough of a market in town to support another dispensary , " Larsen said .
His menu of cannabis products included six strains of dried marijuana , four kinds of hash , two pot products in capsules and double - strength bonbons -- cannabis - infused organic chocolates .
In Oakland , Calif. , the private dispensaries that support the state 's medical marijuana program are said to be generating revenues in excess of $ 70 million a year .
Michelle Rainey is one of roughly 2,500 Canadians with a licence to possess and use marijuana .
Rainey has Crohn 's disease and finds her homegrown pot an effective replacement for the expensive pharmaceutical drugs she 'd been prescribed .
She believes the country 's health - care system could save a fortune if there was a working medical marijuana program .
The roughly 110,000 Canadians suffering from Crohn 's disease and the 90,000 living with ulcerative colitis , for example , are estimated to spend $ 162 million a year for prescription drugs .
Many of those people are already benefiting from marijuana , Rainey said , but many , many more could be .
Consider , too , that many battling cancer and HIV / AIDS find edible cannabis products work to stimulate the appetite , but they 've got to buy them on the street .
" We have a huge problem with physicians being apprehensive about signing for patients even though the proof is there , " Rainey said .
" Our seniors , for instance , are spending their pensions on big pharma only to end up with more aches and pains , when all they may need is a puff or a brownie ! "
In its decision , the Federal Court of Appeal did more than simply hand Ottawa a legal loss .
It said the government had been knowingly dragging its heels since at least 2003 .
As a result , lawyer Kirk Tousaw told B.C. Supreme Court that this decision renders the criminal law invalid based on that history of jurisprudence , which ties enforceability of the criminal law to the existence of a constitutionally adequate medical access scheme .
He said the judgments in Ontario courts and now the federal court mean the state of the law is unclear and therefore criminal sanctions cannot be imposed .
In this latest case -- called Sfetkopoulos et al v. Attorney General of Canada -- some 27 patients with exemptions to possess marijuana for medicinal use applied to Health Canada for authorization to designate Carasel Harvest Supply Corporation as their marijuana producer .
Health Canada refused , saying that violated the regulations that restricted growers to supplying only one patient at a time .
But the Federal Court Trial Division agreed with the patients and declared part of the MMAR unconstitutional because it threatened their liberty and security of the person by preventing them from choosing their marijuana producer .
The judge accepted that sick people should have access to marijuana for the treatment of serious medical conditions and they should not be forced to risk imprisonment to buy their medication on the black market .
He interpreted the constitutional guarantee of security of person rights to include access to medication without undue state interference .
Ottawa appealed and the Oct. 27 ruling was the result .
The question is how Ottawa will respond to the appeal court 's decision .
Since the impugned marijuana access scheme is a product of regulation rather than statute , the government can quickly promulgate new rules .
" They could make cosmetic regulatory changes , " Nash acknowledged , " which would force another court challenge .
" But I think the judges are pretty fed up with them doing that . "

Shareholders approve Koei merger with Tecmo $ 207 million deal given the greenlight to take place later this year
James Lee Monday 26th January 2009

Shareholders have approved the merger between Japanese companies Tecmo and Koei , set to take place on April 1 .
The companies made the announcement in statements to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today , according to Reuters .
Under the USD 207 million deal , announced last November , Tecmo investors will receive 0.9 shares in the merged company for every Tecmo share they hold , while Koei stockholders will receive a one - for - one exchange .
Tecmo attracted the attention of potential buyers , including Square Enix , after the company 's president stepped down , following a public spat with the former Team Ninja lead Tomonobu Itagaki .
While the biggest services are located in China , it takes a fan , often in the United States , to upload the actual stream for distribution to the wider Internet .
This is done by using a PC - tuner card , a $ 50 device that connects a television to a computer , or by uploading the stream from a legitimate online video subscription to a peer - to - peer network .
As technology advances , the problem is likely to become worse as the quality of the picture becomes better .
“ This can only become a more enjoyable experience , ” said Christopher Stokes , the chief executive of NetResult , a company in Britain that consults with the leagues and acts as a sort of Web detective in locating digital pirates .
A recent unpublished report for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris , the first major study of the issue , concluded , “ This poses a major issue for the leagues and organizations who own and control sports as the sale of broadcast rights represents a major source of revenue , enabling the sports leagues to thrive and continue , from grassroots level to professional league . ”
The organization helps developed nations tackle mutual economic problems .
David Price , the head of piracy intelligence at Envisional , a consultant that helped prepare the O.E.C.D. report , said : “ I think it ’s different than looking at movies or music .
You might not go to the cinema , but you ’ll buy the DVD .
With sports , they very much have this one shot to get you to watch the game .
If suddenly there is a way to get that live transmission for free , then there is a real threat to their business . ”
When leagues try to shut down the pirates , executives can find themselves immersed in an endeavor rife with international intrigue : investigators for the Premier League , England ’s top soccer league , chased an offender to Cyprus to serve him court papers , according to Oliver Weingarten , a lawyer for the league .
On a recent morning at the Manhattan offices of Major League Baseball Advanced Media , M.L.B. ’s digital unit , an executive started a laptop and went to a live feed of a soccer game on ESPN Hong Kong that was carried by TVants.com .
M.L.B. officials say TVants.com , based in China , is one of the biggest providers of live game feeds .

NAPLES , Fla. , Nov. 10 ( UPI ) -- A Florida woman has filed suit in small claims court to recover $ 13,200 she paid to a fortune teller .
Eumanthe Dufrene , 54 , charges Doris Palm & Card Reading advertised a money - back guarantee but failed to return what she paid for " spiritual loans " to combat evil , the Naples ( Fla . ) Daily News reports .

Tiffany Johnson , co-owner of the business , says Dufrene paid the money for readings after asking that a curse be placed on a man who killed her son .
Johnson says she told Dufrene they do n't do that kind of work and suggested she go to Haiti if she wanted a curse .
Dufrene 's suit will be decided by a Collier County judge .
The Naples Daily News says published reports indicate only a handful of fortune tellers have been sued by dissatisfied customers .

As the printing presses for the bailouts run at full speed , those in power are no longer even pretending that the new giveaways will fix our problems .
Now that we are used to rewarding failure with taxpayer - funded bailouts , we are being told that this is �just a start , � more funds will inevitably be needed for more industries , and that things would be much worse had we done nothing .
The updated total bailout commitments add up to over $ 8 trillion now .
This translates into a monetary base increase of 75 percent over the last two months .
This money does not come from some rainy day fund tucked away in the budget somewhere � it is created from thin air , and devalues every dollar in circulation .
Dumping money on an economy , as they have been doing , is not the same as dumping wealth .
In fact , it has quite the opposite effect .
One key attribute that gives money value is scarcity .
If something that is used as money becomes too plentiful , it loses value .
That is how inflation and hyperinflation happens .
Giving a central bank the power to create fiat money out of thin air creates the tremendous risk of eventual hyperinflation .
Most of the founding fathers did not want a central bank .
Having just experienced the hyperinflation of the Continental dollar , they understood the power and the temptations inherent in that type of system .
It gives one entity far too much power to control and destabilize the economy .
Our central bankers have had a tremendous amount of hubris over the years , believing that they could actually manage a paper money system in such a way as to replicate the behavior and benefits of a gold standard .
In fact , back in 2004 then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told me as much .
People talk about toxic assets , but the real toxicity in our economy comes from the neo-alchemy practiced by the Federal Reserve System .
Just as alchemists of the past frequently poisoned themselves with the lead or mercury they were trying to turn to gold , today�s bankers are poisoning the economy with accelerated fiat money creation .
Throughout the ages , gold has stood the test of time as a consistently reliable medium of exchange , and has frequently been referred to as � God�s money , � as only God can make more of it .
Seeking superhuman power over money in the way alchemists did in ancient times caused society to shun them as charlatans .
In much the same way , free people today should be sending the message that this power and control over our money is no longer acceptable .
The irony is that even had the ancient practice of alchemy been successful , and gold was suddenly , magically made abundant , alchemists still would have failed to create real wealth .
Creating gold from lead would have cheapened its status to that of rhinestones or cubic zirconia .
It is unnatural and dangerous for paper to be considered as precious as a precious metal .
Our fiat currency system is crumbling and coming to an end , as all fiat currencies eventually do .
Congress should reject the central bank as a failure for its manipulations of money that have brought our economy to its knees .
I am hoping that in the 111th Congress my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve System gains traction so that the central bank can no longer destroy our money .

VALENTINE'S
Day is a couple of months off , but this weekend many couples will be out celebrating .
On December 21st it will be three years since civil partnerships — gay marriages in all but name — were introduced in England and Wales ( Scots and Northern Irish registrars began one and two days earlier respectively ) .
The pent - up eagerness of many couples to tie the knot created an early rush : nearly 4,000 people got hitched that December .
Candlelit restaurants will be doing brisk business in the next few days .
By halfway through this year nearly 60,000 Britons had entered a same - sex union , giving them legal rights virtually identical to those of married couples .
In contrast to their American counterparts , most British gays seem relaxed about not having the right to call their partnership a marriage .
“ It meant we could get the law through sooner .
Changing the wording is not really a priority , ” says a spokesman for Stonewall , a gay - rights lobby group .
And speed is not everything : Denmark was the first country to recognise gay partnerships , in 1989 , but still does not let them adopt children .
Gay couples getting hitched are older than straight ones : men are 43 on average and women 41 , compared with 36 and 34 among straight couples ( including those remarrying ) .
And it seems that gay men , though often characterised as promiscuous , are settling down in greater numbers than lesbians .
Men have out - partnered women in every quarter since civil partnerships were introduced ; in London last year nearly 75 % of those contracted were between men .
Some unions have already broken down ; but so far male partnerships have proved less likely than female ones to end in dissolution .
One explanation offered for this bias is that lesbian identity has been shaped by an anti-marriage strand of feminism .
But that seems to fall down elsewhere : in Vermont , for example , the first American state to offer comprehensive civil unions , about two - thirds of partnerships are between women .
It may simply be that Britain has more gay men than lesbians .
The census does not pry that far , but the Office for National Statistics announced on December 4th that it would begin quizzing people about their sexuality next year in six of its regular surveys .
Estimates broken down by age and region will be available in 2010 .
It will be interesting to see if they tally with the government 's current guess that between 5 % and 7 % of the population is lesbian , gay or bisexual .
Data on civil partnerships suggest that the last category might prove the most surprising : of those who have formed partnerships so far , a tenth of men and nearly a quarter of women were married before to someone of the opposite sex .
Here 's 30 seconds of complete embarrassment .
I wonder if this guy 's seen his own sobriety test footage .
More importantly is that the sound of his eye cracking when he braces himself from the fall with his face ?
The head of a new Congressional panel set up to monitor the gigantic federal bailout says the government still does not seem to have a coherent strategy for easing the financial crisis , despite the billions it has already spent in that effort .
Elizabeth Warren , the chairwoman of the oversight panel , said in an interview Monday that the government instead seemed to be lurching from one tactic to the next without clarifying how each step fits into an overall plan .
“ You ca n’t just say , ‘ Credit is n’t moving through the system , ’ ” she said in her first public comments since being named to the panel .
“ You have to ask why . ”
If the answer is that banks do not have money to lend , it would make sense to push capital into their hands , as the Treasury has been doing over the last two months , she continued .
But if the answer is that their potential borrowers are getting less creditworthy with each passing day , “ pouring money into banks is n’t going to fix that problem , ” she said .

1 Inakadate ’s Crop Art
Each year , farmers in the town of Inakadate in Aomori prefecture create works of crop art by growing a little purple and yellow - leafed “ kodaimai ” rice along with their local green - leafed tsugaru - roman variety .
They have been drawing pictures with rice since 1993 ; their artworks are visible until the rice is harvested each September .
2 3 - D Crop Circle
The astonishing three - dimensional design , 200ft in diameter , has been created in a wheat field at Silbury Hill , Wiltshire , UK .
According to the local folklore , the mound is traditionally visited at sunrise on Midsummer ’s Day by a white figure accompanied by a white hound with red ears .
It has been the setting for several crop circles in the past , including an elaborate 350ft pattern featuring a giant Egyptian mosaic in the shape of two wings , surrounded by symbols which bear a striking resemblance to the Mayan calendar which predicted that the world will end in 2012 .
This 3D design was photographed by Steve Alexander , who with his wife Karen , a writer , has been researching crop circles for more than 15 years .
3 Pi Crop Circle
Also on Wiltshire , this amazingly complex circle is 150ft in diameter , and it ’s a coded image representing the first 10 digits , 3.141592654 , of pi .
The code is based on 10 angular segments with the radial jumps being the indicator of each segment .
Starting at the centre and counting the number of one - tenth segments in each section contained by the change in radius clearly shows the values of the first 10 digits in the value of pi .

Scott Cleland is a " telecom analyst " who , in reality , is actually paid a large sum of money by the telcos to slam Google .
He 's become sort of a joke in DC circles .
In the past , we noted his ridiculously bad math in claiming that Google fleeced taxpayers out of $ 7 billion , as well as his claims that " open spectrum " is somehow anti-American .
His main issue , of course , is trying to dispense bogus arguments for why net neutrality is really a big scam by Google to keep its broadband bills cheap .
To give Cleland credit , at least he's not as bad as Mike McCurry , who once claimed that Google does n't pay a dime for broadband .
McCurry , of course , has moved on from spinning for the telcos to spinning for the entertainment industry , so Cleland needed to up his game .
He 's now released a " study " claiming that Google uses 21 times as much bandwidth as it pays for .
First of all , this is simply incorrect .
Cleland does n't know how much Google actually pays for broadband , so he comes up with a small number , which is wrong for a variety of reasons
He seems to conflate consumer broadband and Google 's broadband .
This is based , in part , on the old telco argument that when you buy internet access , you 're only buying access to the middle of the internet , and you should have to pay a second time to actuallyany endpoint or other user .
So , even though consumers pay for the bandwidth they use to reach Google , Cleland appears to calculate that as being Google 's responsibility , ignoring that consumers are paying plenty for the right to reach Google ( and the rest of the internet ) .
As Cord Blomquist points out , this is like pointing out that Best Buy should pay for the gas it takes for people to drive to Best Buy .
Broadband Reports also does a nice job deconstructing this However , even if we ignore all the basic facts and information that Cleland gets wrong , if we grant his premise , his argument still does n't make any sense .
If anything , rather than being an argument in favor of the telcos ' position , Clelands report ( if true ) suggests that telco execs all deserve to be fired .
After all , they 're the ones who set up the business model and the billing relationship , and if they 're undercharging Google by so much , then should n't they raise their prices ?
Of course , there 's a good reason why this does n't happen : because Google is paying fair market value for its bandwidth , and if anyone tried to charge them 21 times more , Google would quickly take its business elsewhere .
So , based on this report , either Cleland is dead wrong in his report , or the telcos who funded it are run by morons who do n't know how to set pricing correctly .
Which one is more likely ?

Five Blackwater Guards To Face Massacre Charges Next Week Guards have until Monday to surrender to the FBI to face manslaughter charges .
December 5 , 2008  --
Five Blackwater guards have been told to surrender to the FBI by Monday to face federal manslaughter and assault charges connected to the shooting deaths of 17 civilians at an traffic circle in Iraq last year , ABC News has learned .
Law enforcement officials say the grand jury hearing the case was in session Thursday in Washington , D.C. and was expected to have voted on the indictments .
Click here to read the indictment .
The federal investigation revealed that two of the Blackwater guards did most of the shooting and are expected to face either murder or manslaughter charges , law enforcement officials said .
They identified the two as Dustin Heard , of Tennessee , a former Marine who joined Blackwater in 2004 ; and Paul Slough , of Texas , a former U.S. Army infantry soldier who joined Blackwater in 2006 .
Also told to surrender to the FBI on Monday are : Donald Ball , a former Marine Corporal from West Valley City , Utah ; Evan Liberty , a former Marine who guarded US Embassies in Egypt and Guatemala from Rochester , N.H. ; Nick Slatten , a former Army sergeant from the 82 Airborne from Sparta , Tenn .

FBI agents and American prosecutors plan to travel to Baghdad next week to personally brief the families of victims about the indictments , according to the law enforcement officials .
Justice Department officials declined to comment on the ABC News report .
The bloody incident at Baghdad 's Nisoor Square sparked widespread outrage in Iraq over what many considered trigger - happy American security guards who shot at civilians with impunity and no fear of consequences .
Weeks later , the Department of Justice publicly announced it had opened an investigation .
Some of the defense lawyers say their clients , all former decorated members of the military in their 20's , are being used as scapegoats to quell anger at the U.S. in Iraq .
Blackwater maintained its guards fired in self - defense after coming under fire as they protected a diplomatic motorcade .
Civilians at the scene and relatives of the dead told U.S. investigators there was no hostile fire and the shootings were unprovoked .
Case Against Blackwater Guards Likely to Face Serious Legal Challenge
Prosecutors plan to charge the men under a law meant to cover soldiers and military contractors even though the Blackwater guards were in Iraq as part of a State Department security contract , according to lawyers briefed on the case .
As a result , the case is likely to face a serious challenge on technical legal grounds .
" I think a district judge would have really no choice but to dismiss the indictment , " said noted military defense lawyer Gene Fidell , citing the fact the Blackwater contract was not with the military .
The jurisdiction " simply does n't apply , " Fidell said .
In a statement made the day after the September 2007 shooting , Slough told US State Department agents he opened fire on a car because " the driver looked directly at me and kept moving toward our motorcade .
Fearing for my life and the lives of my teammates , I engaged the driver and stopped the threat . "
U.S. investigators say the driver of the car was an unarmed civilian .
Heard , in his statement to agents , said he " heard gunshots " and " engaged the car with approximately 20 to 30 rounds from my M4 rifle . "
Heard 's attorney , David Schertler , said they strongly disagree with the decision to bring charges against Heard , which he characterized as " wrong and unjust . "
Schertler said : " On September 16 , 2007 , at Nisour Square , Blackwater security guards were defending themselves and their comrades who were being shot at and receiving fire from Iraqis they believed to be enemy insurgents , in a place where the enemy has made a major city , Baghdad , the battlefield .
Because of that and because of the deceptive tactics used by these insurgents against Americans , civilian casualties tragically occur .
We have been and remain determined and prepared to fight these charges and we are confident that Dustin Heard will be vindicated . "
Lawyers for the other Blackwater guards declined to comment .
Blackwater says it has cooperated with the investigation and officials say no criminal charges are expected against the company itself .

There ’s a nice little article on Weird Universe about sympathetic pregnancy , also called Couvade Syndrome .
In our culture men sometimes experience some of the symptoms of their partner ’s pregnancy , such as labor pains .
At this point I ’d like to ask all obstetricians , midwives , and doulas to stop reading .
For that matter , women who are pregnant , who plan to become pregnant , who are of childbearing potential , or who know another woman of childbearing potential , should also stop reading .
I do n’t want you to get any ideas .
Other cultures do n’t wait for the man to develop a psychosomatic condition .
In some places in Brazil , for example , the man ’s skin is cut with animal teeth , and then tobacco juice or pepper juice is rubbed into his wounds .
The Huichol Indians of western Mexico take this just a bit farther .
As depicted in this yarn painting , the man is placed on the roof of his hut as his wife is in labor below .
His friends tie ropes around his testicles , and the wife holds the other end .
Every time she feels a labor pain she pulls on the ropes .
It may be my imagination , but through that series of tubes that make up the Internet I seem to be hearing cheers and shouts of “ Right on ! ” “ Give it to him , sister , ” and “ You go , girl ! ” Some of you did n’t stop reading .

John McCain offers his newest lurch today .
In a speech he is to give in Virginia Beach , McCain says 17 times that he will fight for America , according to his prepared remarks .
He repeatedly calls himself a “ fighter . ”
And he ’s an experienced fighter who won’t –like you know who–have to study up on issues before making command decisions .
Over and over in this new stump speech , McCain says he is ready to fight –for the country , for change , for a new direction , for the future , for the children , for justice for all .
Seriously .
Times are tough , McCain notes , but America is worth fighting for .
It needs a fighter like John McCain , who is a real fighter who has always been a fighter for America .
In other words , vote for the fight guy .
Here ’s how the speech ends :
I know what hopelessness feels like .
It ’s an enemy who defeats your will .
I felt those things once before .
I will never let them in again .
I ’m an American .
And I choose to fight .
Do n’t give up hope .
Be strong .
Have courage .
And fight .
Fight for a new direction for our country .
Fight for what ’s right for America .
Fight to clean up the mess of corruption , infighting and selfishness in Washington .
Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead .
Fight for the ideals and character of a free people .
Fight for our children ’s future .
Fight for justice and opportunity for all .
Stand up to defend our country from its enemies .
Stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
America is worth fighting for .
Nothing is inevitable here .
We never give up .
We never quit .
We never hide from history .
We make history .
Get the picture ?
This new pitch does n’t even qualify as a Hail Mary .
It seems not substantial enough to rate as a real play .
It ’s as if McCain ’s handlers did a focus group and found that the one word undecided voters associate positively with McCain is “ fighter . ”
And that ’s all McCain ’s strategist have to work with .
That would n’t be a shock .
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll is loaded with bad news for the McCainiacs .
Not only is Obama up by 10 points among registered voters , but Obama is seen by more registered voters ( 55 percent ) as a safe choice for president than McCain ( 50 percent ) .
Worse for McCain , the poll shows that far more voters believe he is attacking his opponent rather than addressing the issues ( 59 percent ) than those who feel the same about Obama ( 26 percent . )
And McCain ’s favorable rating has in the past month dropped from 59 percent to 52 percent , while Obama ’s has gone up from 58 percent to 64 percent .
Which means McCain ’s blistering attacks against Obama have boomeranged .
They have made him seem a candidate mired in mud .
If the poll is accurate , then the McCain campaign cannot stick to this road .
Though McCain promised die - hard ( rabid , that is ) supporters last week he would blast Obama with Bill Ayers at the final debate Wednesday night , it could well be counterproductive for him to do so .
What are his options , then ?
McCain and his advisers appear to believe it ’s to say the word “ fight ” over and over .
To reprise the POW pitch and offer McCain to voters as a fighter .
Rah , rah .
Fight , team , fight .
This seems rather pathetic .
It is true that the first thing a candidate has to do when he ’s in a hole is to stop digging .
But McCain may need a better ladder than this .
UPDATE : NY Times Adds Unique Twist in Censoring Genocidal Numbers
Brad Jacobson Byon

Guest blogged by Brad Jacobson of MediaBloodhound
From the aftermath of the 2003 " shock and awe " bombing campaign all the way through Thanksgiving Day 2008 , major US news outlets have nearly uniformly blacked out or downplayed reports of the Iraqi death toll .
But a recent Associated Press article reveals the depths to which these outlets are still willing to delve to censor this information .
In the November 27 article " Iraqi Parliament OKs US Troops for 3 More Years , " by Christopher Torchia and Qassim Abdul - Zahra , AP editors approved the following characterization of Iraqi deaths suffered since the US invasion :
The war has claimed more than 4,200 American lives and killed a far greater , untold number of Iraqis , consumed huge reserves of money and resources and eroded the global stature of the United States , even among its closest allies .
How 's that for a statistically rigorous accounting ?
With the exactitude of a third - grader 's book report cribbed from a novel 's dust jacket copy , the AP --- America 's # 1 wire news service --- blankets US news outlets with a quantification of Iraqi casualties that would 've made Stalin proud .
Seriously , it 's 2008 .
Everybody knows the emperor has no clothes and no clue .
Barack Obama is the President - elect .
Reality , thankfully ( however tentatively ) , is in vogue .
Yet America's " most respected news sources " are still treating the Iraqi death toll as if we 're living in a pre-neoconned world .
As MediaBloodhound reported last April , when Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) , a well - regarded non-partisan British polling agency that has conducted studies for the BBC and the British Conservative Party , released its January 2008 follow - up report estimating over 1 million Iraqi deaths since the US invasion --- which both reconfirmed its September 2007 estimate as well as supported prior findings of the 2006 John Hopkins study published in the British medical journal Lancet ( 650,000 deaths ) --- a LexisNexis search showed no US mainstream news outlet carried the story .
MediaBloodhound also pointed out at the time that , writing in FAIR 's newsletter Extra ! , Patrick McElwee cited an " Associated Press poll in February ( 2/24/07 ) that asked Americans how many Iraqis have died received a median response of less than 10,000 . "
The November 27 AP article in question , which glibly and mindlessly quantifies Iraqi deaths since the invasion as merely a " far greater , untold number " in comparison to Americans killed in the war , reflects how AP 's February 2007 poll respondents could be so clueless .
Even Iraq Body Count 's estimates , proven to undercount for a few reasons ( for one , they only attempt to account for " noncombatants " ) , were tens of thousands of casualties higher than the median estimate provided by respondents in the 2007 AP poll .
Today , the Iraq Body Count estimates around 100,000 Iraqi deaths .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) published its estimate of Iraqi dead last January , though its count only covered the time from the beginning of the war through June 2006 .
Its findings then , which would n't account for nearly two and a half years of the war since ?
The WHO estimated between 104,000 and 223,000 deaths , with a median of 151,000 .
Whenever citing the Iraqi death toll since the 2003 invasion , the AP , and any news outlet wishing to be seen as credible , should at the very least either a provide a range of estimates from viable sources ( e.g. , 200,000 to over 1 million ) or a median estimate ( e.g. , roughly 600,000 ) .
As McElwee stated nearly a year ago , " If Americans are to make informed judgments not only about the invasion of Iraq and whether the occupation should continue , but also about future wars our government may wish to start , then we need to have good information about the war 's impact on Iraqis . "
Major US news outlets , with their number # 1 wire service now leading the way in censoring the Iraqi death toll , continue to report on this subject , the rare times it surfaces in articles , as though it 's still 2003 .
It was wrong then .
Today , it should at least be grounds for editors to be reprimanded or lose their jobs and for immediate corrections to be printed .
It 's 2008 .
Enough is enough .
Give us the damn facts and get out of the way .
UPDATE : Yesterday 's New York Times article " More Iraqi Dead Last Month , But Fewer Than Last Year , " by Alissa J. Rubin , keeps up this grand tradition of censoring the Iraqi death toll in a report about the Iraqi death toll .
Here 's the lede :
The numbers of Iraqi civilian deaths and improvised explosive devices increased in November , although there were still fewer of each than in September , according to statistics from the Interior Ministry .
The number of civilian deaths last month was 148 , compared with 118 in October and 156 in September .
The number of I.E.D. ’s was 108 , compared with 79 in October and 113 in September .
Most measures of violence remain much lower than last fall .
As far as numbers go , that 's all our paper of record provides .
No range of estimates on the number of Iraqi dead .
No median calculation derived from that range .
Not even a reference to the overall Iraqi lives lost since the US invasion .
AP's " far greater , untold number " may be woefully deficient yet Times editors managed to ignore the topic altogether , as though counting Iraqi deaths is only possible in monthly increments , microcosmic snapshots that conveniently keep the genocidal numbers out of sight and out of mind .

November 15 , 2008 at 17:47 Tags Compilation , Python
I 'm happy to announce that I 've finally released version 1.0 of pycparser - a complete ANSI C parser written in Python .
It generates a complete AST from C code , and thus can serve as a front - end for a C compiler , or as a platform for static code analysis of C .
pycparser uses PLY to construct the lexer and the parser for the C language .
At the moment it supports ANSI C89 ( the language described in K & R2 ; ) .
We ’ve had three general meetings open to anyone interested in getting involved in our work .
During this time we ’ve started envisioning the work of the organization , discussed individual ideas and started to meld them into a group vision .
We ’ve had social time and we ’ve had constructive dialog of what the next steps of our group are .
At our last meeting , I realized that maybe newcomers may get an odd sense of fluidity of the group .
Which is primarily because we are absolutely fluid right now .
The organizational formation is based on the participation of those who show up .
Eventually , we ’ll have membership requirements , set job duties and responsibilities , governance structures , and something we ’ve called “ the Plan ” ( instead of strategic or business ) .
For now we ’ve got idea sharing , research and proposals , amorphous dialog and really , an unclear future .
That ’s because we are forming a worker ’s cooperative , where the members are the owners .
Where we grow food for our own consumption and to make a living for ourselves ( by sharing profits ) .
We will be values driven .
We will have standards based on a shared set of values ( environmental , social , economic and collaborative ) .
We will be comfortable with what we ’ve created because WE’VE collectively created it .
And we ’ll work collaboratively and democratically .
Soon enough , we ’ll have membership requirements .
Organizational structures and policies .
Profit sharing schemes .
Prices structures , etc .
And they ’ll all be based on the shared values of those organizing the group .
Ashley has recently joined us with an interest in assisting the organizing of the business systems .
She has experience in government , which will be invaluable as we move forward .
Policy and legal documents can be difficult to wade through and she is an example of someone who brings skills and know - how that are hugely appreciated .
She tagged the Seattle Farm Worker Cooperative ’s work as “ creating opportunity for Urban Farmers . ”
This is a perfect tag - line for our work going forward .
We want to step outside the idea of gardening .
We want to walk away from individual effort and towards shared responsibility as well as mutually beneficial relationships .
We want to think of Seattle ’s usable lands as potential space for collaboration with each other , our communities and our environment .
If you have a skill such as Ashley or just a passion for organizing and local food , feel free to meet up with us anywhere in the process .
We meet every two weeks in a general community meeting and in between on Team Organizing meetings .
Our next general meeting will be in the first week of the year , and we ’ll be discussing Group Process , Dynamics and Decision Making .
Keep in touch !

The Czech Republic could be " a bigger problem than Ireland " for the ratification of the Lisbon treaty , German social - democrat MEP Jo Leinen told EUobserver after returning from Prague on a delegation divided by its approach to the problem .
A group of " hardliners in the Senate " and Czech President Vaclav Klaus are playing a " postponing game " on Lisbon , Mr Leinen explained , saying the clique has already ensured Lisbon will not be ratified by the time the Czech republic takes over the EU presidency on 1 January 2009 .
" There will be a shadow on the Czech presidency and they will be confronted with this situation already at the December summit and from the first day of their presidency , " the MEP , who is the chairman of the European Parliament 's constitutional affairs committee , explained .
The European Parliament delegation visited the Czech capital last week , after a verdict by the constitutional court on whether the EU treaty is compatible with the country 's charter was postponed from 10 November to 25 November .
The Czech republic and Ireland are the biggest obstacles to Lisbon ratification , although the German and Polish presidents have also refused to sign off on the text for now .
Prague will resume its parliamentary procedure after the constitutional court verdict .
But Ireland rejected the text in a referendum in June , with pro-Lisbon treaty politicians now keen to isolate Dublin to force a second vote .
" The key problem that we face is to oblige and persuade the Irish to change their mind about the Treaty of Lisbon , and the [ Czech ] presidency will play a key part in that exercise .
So instead of becoming part of the solution to the Irish problem , a Czech presidency that is reluctant to ratify itself will become part of the problem , " UK liberal MEP Andrew Duff told this website .
" Until they ratify , the Czech EU presidency will not have credibility and authority , " he added .
Failure to adopt Lisbon could in the end split the EU into sub-groups , the British constitutional expert warned .
" [ It would ] break the cohesion of the EU , leaving the Czechs and Irish behind , for instance in establishing a separate [ EU ] treaty in security and defence matters . "
Danish eurosceptic MEP
Hanne Dahl has complained about the delegation 's Czech foray on her personal blog , however , calling her colleagues ' attempt to pressure Czech politicians a breach of " normal diplomatic behaviour " and " completely unacceptable . "
" What several members of the delegation said was not in any way the official opinion of the EU parliament .
The [ parliament ] did not issue a statement saying that it thinks the Czech republic is not qualified to chair the EU presidency because it did n't ratify the Lisbon Treaty , " she said .
Ms Dahl said the situation is exemplary of how smaller EU countries are treated if they do not follow the mainstream , adding that some EU capitals want to set up a rotating EU presidency among just the six biggest EU states if Lisbon fails .
Denmark is also a small country which had four opt-outs from common EU policies when it chaired the EU " quite successfully " in 2002 , undermining the argument that the Czech republic cannot do a good job , she argued .
Her remarks left Mr Duff unfazed .
" We certainly ought not to apologise at all for putting pressure on the Czech parliament , the sooner they can conclude it [ the ratification ] , the more pleased we would be and the better the prospect for persuading the Irish to alter their mind would be . "
' EU dissident ' meets No campaigner
Meanwhile , Czech President Vaclav Klaus planned to meet Irish politician and No-campaigner Declan Ganley in Dublin on Tuesday ( 11 November ) .
" My predecessor Vaclav Havel also liked to meet dissidents in different countries , so I will now meet a European Union dissident .
And I see myself as one of them , " Mr Klaus said before making the trip .
Mr Ganley is chairman of the Libertas association , which led the campaign for a No vote in June .
Mr Klaus was the only European head of state to welcome the Irish rejection of the treaty , aimed at streamlining EU decision - making after recent enlargement , calling it a " victory over European bureaucracy . "
The Libertas website said Mr Ganley was now working on " a platform that could give all EU citizens a chance to express their views on Lisbon at the ballot box next June " - the date of the next European elections .
Dear Mr. President - Elect ,
Greetings from Antarctica !
I 'm about to begin my mission to become the first American in history to reach the South Pole , solo and unaided .
I 'll start walking November 8th from the edge of the ice pack and , if all goes according to plan , arrive at the Pole just after Christmas .
If you have a minute around then , I 'd love to hear from you , just ring my satellite phone .
It 's the least you could do , I mean , I delivered the vote for you here in the Deep South ( so to speak ) .
All kidding aside , I cast my ballot for Obama / Biden in advance and did all the fundraising I could in my hometown of Philadelphia before leaving for the seventh continent .
Your progressive stance on fighting global warming and your bold vision for our renewable energy future made my decision pretty easy .
But the main reason I voted for you is because of the effects of climate change I 've witnessed first - hand here in Antarctica .
Last year , during my second solo attempt to reach the South Pole , I was stopped dead in my tracks by something this continent rarely experiences .
Snow .
A full - blown blizzard , in fact .
Most people probably are n't aware of the fact that Antarctica is the driest continent on Earth ; it 's literally a desert of ice with an average of a single inch of precipitation each year .
So what I experienced was akin to standing in the middle of the Sahara during the dry season and getting whacked by a torrential downpour .
As I stood there blinded by the whiteout that had enveloped me , I called a friend back at base camp , a veteran explorer marking his 31st straight year of Antarctic expeditions .
“ I 've never seen anything like this mate .
I do n't know what to make of it , ” he replied .
Things are changing here , way too fast .
That type of extreme weather is becoming all too common around the globe , and scientists have no doubt that we humans are disrupting the climate , with potentially devastating impacts for humanity .
It 's high time for bold action .
When I succeed in reaching the South Pole on December 26th , the greatest reward I could imagine would n't be a trip to Disney World .
It 'd be receiving a call from you , confirming your commitment to fight global warming aggressively and work to end our fossil fuel addiction ASAP .
If you 'd like to receive news from me during the trek , I 'll be blogging from my tent , just sign up for my expedition e-lerts .
MUMBAI , India 
Some day , Farhang Jehani might patch up the bullet holes and cover the shrapnel pockmarks .
But for now they are the Leopold Cafe ’s new décor .
“ We are going to let it be , ” Mr. Jehani said over the din of his crowded restaurant , where eight people were killed in the Mumbai terrorist attacks last month .
“ It ’s part of history . ”
In the two weeks since the attacks , this Mumbai neighborhood of narrow streets shared by street urchins and the well - to - do has staggered back onto its feet .
But at the Leopold , it is often standing room only .
The restaurant has become a sort of shrine of defiance against terrorism .
That , at least , is how Mr. Jehani portrays it .
“ I want it to go on the same way , as if nothing has happened , ” he said .

In the last few years there have been many articles in the newspapers attacking homeopathy , claiming it contains nothing more than water , ignoring all the positive studies and saying it works through the placebo effect .
So I decided to compile a list of facts to counter this criticism and present the salient points as clearly as possible .
So far I have come up with 50 . *
Fact 1 - Hippocrates ' The Father of Medicine ' of Ancient Greece said there were two Laws of Healing : The Law of Opposites and the Law of Similars .
Homeopathy treats the patient with medicines using the Law of Similars , orthodox medicine uses the Law of Opposites , e.g. antibiotics , anti-inflammatories , anticonvulsants , antihypertensives , anti-depressants , anti-psychotics . *
Fact 2 - Homeopathic theories are based on fixed principles of the Laws of Nature which do not change -- unlike medical theories which are constantly changing !*
Fact 3 - Homeopathy is an evidence - based , empirical medicine .*
Fact 4 - Homeopathy is both an art and a science .*
Fact 5 - The Homeopathicof medicines are a more scientific method of testing than the orthodox model . *
Fact 6 - Homeopathic medicine awakens and stimulates the body 's own curative powers .
The potentized remedy acts as a catalyst to set healing into motion . *
Fact 7 - Homeopathic medicines work by communicating a current / pattern / frequency of energy via the whole human body to jump start the body 's own inherent healing mechanisms . *
Fact 8 - Homeopathy assists the body to heal itself , to overcome an illness which brings the patient to alevel of health .

These were reduced to 21 trials of homeopathy and 9 of conventional medicine of ' higher quality ' and further reduced to 8 and 6 trials , respectively , which were ' larger , higher quality ' .
The final analysis which concluded that ' the clinical effects of homoeopathy are placebo effects ' was based on just the eight ' larger , higher quality ' clinical trials of homeopathy .

" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 24 - The Reduction Meta Operator
say [+] 1 , 2 , 3 ; # 6 say [ + ] ( ) ; # 0 say [ ~ ] < a b > ; # ab say [**]
2 , 3 , 4 ; # 2417851639229258349412352 [ \+ ]
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 # 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 [ \**]
2 , 3 , 4 # 4 , 81 , 2417851639229258349412352 if [ < = ] @list { say " ascending order " ; }
The reduction meta operator [...] can enclose any associative infix operator , and turn it into a list operator .
This happens as if the operator was just put between the items of the list , so [ op ] $ i1 , $ i2 , @rest returns the same result as if it was written as $ i1 op $ i2 op @rest [ 0 ] op @rest [ 1 ] ... .
This is a very powerful construct that promotes the plus + operator into a sum function , ~ into a join ( with empty separator ) and so on .
It is somewhat similar to the List. reduce function , and if you had some exposure to functional programming , you 'll probably know about foldl and foldr ( in Lisp or Haskell ) .
Unlike those , [...] respects the associativity of the enclosed operator , so [ /] 1 , 2 , 3 is interpreted as ( 1 / 2 ) / 3 ( left associative ) , [**] 1 , 2 , 3 is handled correctly as 1 ** ( 2** 3 ) ( right associative ) .
Like all other operators , whitespace are forbidden , so you while you can write [+ ] , you ca n't say [ + ] .
( This also helps to disambiguate it from array literals ) .
Since comparison operators can be chained , you can also write things like
if [ == ] @nums { say " all nums in @nums are the same " } elsif [ < ] @nums { say " @nums is in strict ascending order " } elsif [ < = ] @nums { say " @nums is in ascending order " }
However you cannot reduce the assignment operator :
my @a = 1..3 ; [ = ] @a , 4 ; # Cannot reduce with = because list assignment operators are too fiddly
There 's a special form of this operator that uses a backslash like this : [ \+ ] .
It returns a list of the partial evaluation results .
So [ \+ ]
1..3 returns the list 1 , 1+2 , 1+2+3 , which is of course 1 , 3 , 6 .
[ \~ ] ' a ' .. ' d ' # < a ab abc abcd >
Since right - associative operators evaluate from right to left , you also get the partial results that way :
[\**]
1..3 ; # 3 , 2**3 , 1**( 2** 3 ) , which is 3 , 8 , 1
Multiple reduction operators can be combined :
[ ~ ] [ \**]
1..3 ; # " 381 "
Programmers are lazy , and do n't want to write a loop just to apply a binary operator to all elements of a list .
List . reduce does something similar , but it 's not as terse as the meta operator ( [+ ] @list would be @list.reduce ( &infix :<+ > ) ) .
Also with reduce you have to takes care of the associativity of the operator yourself , whereas the meta operator handles it for you .
If you 're not convinced , play a bit with it ( rakudo implements it ) , it 's real fun .

One of the proposals we hear for stimulating our economy is extending unemployment benefits .
If a worker has been out of a job for 26 weeks , the benefits typically stop .
Extending payments for a full calendar year will supposedly improve the economy .
Why does it make the U.S. more competitive and vibrant if we tax working Americans to give money to non-working Americans ?
In a cyclical recession , an unemployed guy in Michigan could reasonably wait around for a year until things picked up and he could find a job again .
Those extra 26 weeks of unemployment benefits enabled the guy to stay in the same house and be available when his skills were needed , oftentimes by his former employer .
Whatever we ’re in right now , however , does n’t seem to be part of a business cycle .
We handed over most of society ’s wealth to our least productive citizens ( realtors , mortgage brokers , Wall Street mediocrities ) .
We raised taxes until business moved offshore .
We dumbed down our schools until companies could find better educated workers in countries where people live very comfortably on $ 5,000 per year .
Do we seriously believe that Michigan is going to bounce back within our lifetimes , much less within the proposed 52 weeks of extended unemployment payments ?
An unemployed worker in Michigan needs to move somewhere with a lot of new jobs being created and not too many highly skilled unemployed people competing for those jobs ( state - by - state statistics ) .
Certainly he is going to have to move to another state .
Possibly he may need to move to another country .
Handing out 52 weeks of cash instead of 26 weeks seems likely only to delay the inevitable .
The guy will be a bit better rested when he finally does move , but he will also be out of practice from not having worked for a year .
Could it be that extending unemployment benefits is a sensible practice that worked in cyclical recessions , but we ’re now trying to apply it after a major structural shift in the U.S. economy ?
The Easter Event that was available in Pokémon
Go for a few days has now ended .
However , it seems that the developers are already working on a new event that will be soon released for the game .
According to reports , the next event that will be released for Pokémon GO will be a game - changer .
We have to say that Niantic will really need to bring some new features and options to the game in order to keep the players interested .
We have to mention that other rival games , such as Clash of Clans , are already receiving new updates that make the Pokémon
Go fans ditch their game for some other titles that seem more fun .
Niantic is preparing some new changes to the Pokémon GO by launching a nest migration .
In concordance with the dataminers , this will actually be the 19th nest migration , switching out local nests , spawns and cluster spawns .
If this is true and the developers will just bring a nest migration to Pokémon Go , then most of the players will just leave the game .
According to a post from Reddit , there are already many players who already have Poliwag , Sentret and Rattata , and they are now wondering if it is still worth to play Pokémon Go .
To make things even worse , there are reports suggesting that the Easter Event was not that successful in Pokémon Go , because many players claimed that they ’ve been catching the same Pocket Monsters that now have different IVs ( stats ) and movesets from each other .
This might make the Pokémon
Go fans even more frustrated , determining them to quit the game before the next update will be released for the game .
The summer update that Pokémon Go will receive will be sometime in July 2017 .
Until then , we should not expect too many significant changes that will be added to this game .
Leave it to a pastor to make one of my absolute favorite and most heavenly pasta dishes known to mankind , a recipe that also happens to be the most fattening pasta dish known to mankind .
First , slice up 1 pound of bacon into pieces about one inch wide .
Once they ’re sliced , just toss your bacon pieces into a stainless steel pan .
Cook until browned and crisp .
While the bacon ’s cooking , set a pot of salted water ( I use about 2 tablespoon of salt for a gallon of water ) on the stove for our pasta .
When it comes to a boil add your linguine and cook until al dente , tender - firm .
Next , chop your onion .
When the bacon is cooked , scoop it out with a slotted spoon and set it onto a plate .
Reserve the bacon grease !
We still need that stuff .
Throw the diced onions into the bacon grease .
Give the onions a quick stir and let them cook down over a medium - high heat for a couple of minutes .
In the meantime , thinly slice the garlic .
After the onions have cooked for a couple of minutes , throw in the garlic .
Adding it after the onions have cooked a little will prevent the garlic from burning .
After the onion and garlic have cooked for another couple of minutes , remove from the pan with a slotted spoon .
Discard the grease .
Place the pan back on high heat until it starts to smoke a little .
As soon as the pan begins to smoke , pour in the white wine ( or chicken stock ) .
Whisk until pan is thoroughly deglazed and all of the brown bits have come off of the bottom of the pan .
Add 1 cup of chicken stock .
Return bacon , onion and garlic back to the pan .
Let simmer over medium heat .
Crack four eggs into a large bowl .
Add most of the Parmesan cheese , and rough chop the parsley , adding it into the eggs as well .
Leave a little Parmesan and parsley out for a garnish .
Mix well with a fork .
Drain the water from your pasta .
Be sure the pasta is very hot .
Add the pasta to the egg mixture and then add the bacon / onion mixture .
Finally throw a ½ stick ( 1/4 cup ) of butter in there .
Mix it all together well .
Pepper to taste .
Garnish with Parmesan and parsley .
And you ’re done !
Enjoy !

Pastor Ryan ’s nice .
He did n’t want you guys to miss a brand spankin ’ new recipe this morning just because I spent an entire weekend eating leftover lobster tail on my hotel bed , And leave it to a pastor to make one of my absolute favorite and most heavenly pasta dishes known to mankind , a recipe that also happens to be the most fattening pasta dish known to mankind .
There ’s a correlation there , you know .
Enjoy , and I ’ll see you in my kitchen tomorrow !
-PW
Hey there everyone !
It ’s Ryan and I have something to declare :
Today will be a good day .
Today will be a good day because bacon and eggs are going to come together with pasta , and for that reason alone , today shall be called good .
For those of you who do not know , this is Carbonara .
Pasta alla Carbonara is a traditional Italian dish we Americans have pretty much perverted with all kinds of crazy stuff .
We do that sometimes .
But today , we ’re going to stick very pretty close to the authentic Italian version of this amazing and surprisingly simple pasta .
Ready to rock ?
Let ’s roll .
For this recipe , we ’ll need :
* 1lb linguine pasta
* 4 eggs
* 1 pound bacon or pancetta
* 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese
* 8 -12 cloves of garlic
* 1 large onion
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 1 cup white wine ( or substitute another cup of stock )
* 1/2 stick of butter
* 1 handful of parsley
* 1 - 2 tablespoons black pepper
THIS SHOULD EASILY FEED 4 ADULT HUMANS .
Now , as is the case with all good things in our lives , we ’ll begin with BACON .
First , slice up 1 pound of bacon into pieces about one inch wide .
These will become bacon bits , which I believe to be the magical fairy dust of the food world .
Once they ’re sliced , just toss your bacon pieces into a stainless steel pan .
Non -stick will work fine too , but stainless will help us achieve more depth of flavor later on .
So let ’s get that bacon browning .
While the bacon ’s cooking , set a pot of salted water ( I use about 2 tbsp . salt for a gallon of water ) on the stove for our pasta .
Next , we need to chop our onion .
I wo n’t go into all the details of how to chop an onion as Ree has already taught us that .
Keep an eye on that bacon , as it would be a terrible tragedy to burn it .
Burned bacon is not tasty .
The way it looks here is pretty much the amount of doneness we need .
Once the desired bacon bliss has been achieved , just scoop it out with a slotted spoon and set it onto a plate .
And do n’t dump the grease !
… er…uh … I mean…uh … ” the renderings . ”
Yeah , do n’t dump out the renderings .
We still need that stuff .
Okay , now that we ’ve spooned out all of our bacon , we can throw the diced onions into the bacon grease .
Give the onions a quick stir and let them cook down over a medium - high heat for a couple of minutes .
In the meantime , we can slice up our garlic .
I like to slice the garlic in thin sheets for this recipe instead of mincing it .
I do n’t know why , I just do .
After the onions have cooked for a couple of minutes , throw in the garlic .
Yes , all of it !
Adding it after the onions have cooked a little will prevent the garlic from burning .
Garlic burns up a little faster than the onions .
If your water is boiling by now , go ahead and add in your pasta .
I ’m using linguine .
It should take about 9 - 10 minutes .
After the onion and garlic have cooked for another couple of minutes , they should be removed from the pan with our slotted spoon , leaving the grease … um … renderings behind .
I think I like the word “ grease ” better .
How ’bout you ?
Yum .
Yum yum .
Yum yum yum .
Okay : NOW ’S THE TIME TO DISCARD THE BACON GREASE .
Once we ’ve gotten rid of that grease , we should be left with a pan that looks something like this — a little greasy , with all the nice brownness still stuck to the bottom of the pan .
Place the pan back on high heat until it starts to smoke a little .
As soon as the pan begins to smoke , pour in your white wine ( or chicken stock if you ’re not into the whole wine scene . )
If you ’re cooking on a gas range , you may want to remove the pan from the flame when you pour in the wine , as it can sometimes ignite .
Using a whisk , fork , spatula , or wooden spoon , you ’ll want to scrape the bottom of the pan vigorously until the little bits of flavor have released themselves into the liquid .
Voila !
You ’ve just deglazed a pan !
After scraping , I ’ll add in my 1 cup of chicken stock .
Then I ’ll return my bacon , onion , and garlic to the sauce I ’ve just created .
Now we ’ll stir it all together and let it simmer over medium heat .
Allowing the hot part of our sauce to simmer , we ’re now going to crack those four eggs into a large bowl .
The bowl needs to be large enough to hold all the pasta and other ingredients , and still leave room to stir together .
Add most of the Parmesan ( leave out a little bit for a topper ) and rough chop the parsley , adding it to the eggs as well .
Leave out a little extra parsley for garnishing .
Mix it all up .
Now drain off the water from your steaming hot pasta .
And add the hot pasta to the egg / parmesan / parsley mixture .
It ’s important that the pasta be very hot , because this is what cause the eggs to thicken .
The final “ layer ” of the sauce goes on top of the pasta .
And I ’m sorry , but right before we mix the pasta , we need to add … gulp … 1/2 stick butter .
Now MIX !
Tongs work great for this .
Get everything all worked together .
And be sure to add in lots of black pepper .
Combine everything …and that ’s it !
It ’s time for us to serve it up .
Toss on a little bit more cheese and parsley and you ’ve got a beautiful Italian classic .
And believe me when I tell you this : Tasting is believing .
I made this Carbonara for some dinner guests the other night and we had terrible conversation during dinner .
That ’s kind of a goal of mine .
Love Wins ,
Ryan
Billy Corgan outraged fans in New York this week when Smashing Pumpkins played two consecutive nights at the United Palace Theatre .
Let 's just say that the response from the crowd and the critics to his new direction was , er , far from complimentary .
The reaction to the first night was pretty scathing , to say the least .
Matthew Perpetua of Fluxblog wrote that " the few thousand bitter , heartbroken fans [ … ] exited the United Palace as if on a death march .
Really , how else were people supposed to feel about a two - and - a - half - hour show that mostly emphasised new material , generally avoided old classics , and included at least 40 minutes of formless prog-metal dirges and artless , atonal drones ? "
Rolling Stone , meanwhile , said that " things quickly fell off a cliff , bogged down by tuneless dirges " .
And it did n't improve on the second night , even though Corgan gave the fans more of the songs they wanted , and with the crowd growing restless and heckling him , Corgan decided to invite a fan onstage to air his criticisms .
" Last night 's show sucked ! " the lad shouted at Corgan .
" Would you like your money back ? " the frontman asked , as they discussed the matter away from the microphones .
Initially , Corgan looked like he was taking it all in his stride and accepting the complaints .
But then he ruined it all .
As the fan left the stage , Corgan said : " By the way , I liked that song you wrote .
What was it called ?
Take Your Dick Out of My Ass and Stick It In My Mouth ?
That was a big hit in Europe . "
Beyond the childish and homophobic nature of this retort , it begs a serious question .
These days , with gigs being the lifeblood of the music industry , how are you supposed to complain if things are not to your liking ?
If even when you 're face - to - face with the culprit you 're still struggling to get your point across , what right of reply is there ?
You can always walk out .
You can always vow never to go and see that artist again .
But by that point the band has taken your money and run .
It seems a strange in a world where if you buy something in a shop and then regret your decision , you can take it back and get a refund .
Why can't the same rule apply for gigs ?
Phrase that never ends well - " Hey , guys ... Watch this ! "

You bought a brand new laptop computer for mom - the Apple Macbook was too expensive so you settled for a Dell machine loaded with Windows Vista and a trial copy of Office 2007 .
Your mom is a great self - learner and knows all the basic stuff about computers but needs some help is in finding the right software tools that will help her do stuff more efficiently and as inexpensively as possible .
Letter to Mom suggesting tools and web apps for her new computer
Dear Mom -
I hope you are enjoying the new Dell notebook .
Now the first thing I want you to do is install PC Decrapifier - this will detect and remove all the unwanted trial programs that came pre-installed with your machine .
Next you should install Firefox - it ’s an Internet Explorer like web browser but slightly better .
Instead of using browser bookmarks , try the delicious add - on to save the addresses of all your favorite websites .
Another add - on that you should install is Iterasi - web pages come and go but Iterasi will permanently archive your favorite web pages ( like that eggless cake recipe ) .
You should create two email accounts one Gmail.com - share the primary email address with your friends and family but for everything else ( like the newsletter and shopping deal alerts ) always use the secondary email address .
If you come across a site that requires registration , generate a temporary email address from 10 MinuteMail.com and enter without sharing your main email .
With so many websites around , you ’ll soon find it very hard to remember all those passwords so get into the habit of putting down all the different passwords into KeepPass from day one .
If you plan to carry this laptop in public places ( like the Library ) , get this Laptop Alarm software that will emit a loud sound if someone tries to shut down your computer or remove the power cable .
Laptop thefts are not so uncommon after all .
The trial version of Microsoft Office on your computer will expire after 60 days so you may completely uninstall that software and switch over to Google Docs - it has all the basic feature you would need in an Office suite including templates for tracking expenses and utility bills .
You can use your primary Gmail address to log into Google Docs .
Sometimes your friends will send you documents , images or video clips that wo n’t open on your computer - that ’s because you do n’t have the right viewer software on your machine .
You can simply go to zamzar.com and convert the file into some simple format ( like avi for video , jpg for images , doc for documents , mp3 for songs , etc. ) that you computer can play / open .
If the computer contains too many programs that you ’ll rarely or never use , get the Revo Uninstaller to get rid of such programs permanently .
To free up additional space on the hard drive , use WinDirStat to learn about file folders that are occupying the maximum space on your computer and delete the unnecessary files .
Be very careful when deleting files on your computer but if you ever delete something important accidently , Recuva may help you recover all those erased files .
It even works with the memory card of your digital camera .
To download pictures from your digital camera onto the computer , get Windows Live Photo Gallery .
This software can also upload your photos to our common family Flickr account so everyone gets to see your pictures even though we are several hundred miles away from you .
If the computer is not able to play your huge collection of DVD movies , you ’re probably missing some codecs ( do n’t worry about the term ) - just download the VLC player and the DVDs will play just fine .
You should also get Live Mesh - it will allow us to share files and documents with each other privately plus you can use Mesh to backup important files onto the cloud ( I mean the web ) .
I am almost always available for chat on Google Talk but if some of your online friends use other chat software ( like Yahoo ! Messenger or AOL ) , you can easily connect with them through Miranda or , if you do n’t want to install any software , use Meebo .
Another thing - do open an account at PayPal and link it to your main credit card as this will make online shopping easier .
If you ever have a problem with PayPal or something is n’t clear , just call their toll - free 1- 800 support number from your browser using Gizmo .
If your current voice plan is too expensive , I suggest that you download Skype - it lets you make calls from the computer to any landline or mobile phone at much cheaper rates .
We can also use Skype to have video chats on weekends but if you do n’t find me online , just send me a video email with Eyejot .
If you have newspaper clippings , bill receipts and business cards lying in the closet , just take a picture of them separately using the camera of your mobile phone and transfer them to the computer with Evernote - it will turn your “ paper ” documents into digital format that is always so easy to find and manage .
When planning a movie or weekend dinner with friends , you can send all of them a quick reminder for the event via phone and SMS for free using Notifu .
If you ’re inviting people at home for a party , head - over to sites like VideoJug.com , SuTree or 5 min.com for new ideas about food , cocktails , party games , etc .
If you ever need to fax a document somewhere , just go to FaxZero , upload the document and fax it for free .
FaxZero is only available for fax numbers of US or Canada but for international numbers , you may try eFax .
You can also consider dropping those magazine subscriptions that are delivered by snail mail - switch to Zinio instead that delivers the same magazine but in digital format .
As far as I remember , you ’re currently using an unlimited data plan for the Internet but if that ’s not true , get BitMeter - it will help you visually monitor your bandwidth usage so you never exceed the plan limit .
You may also want to download FlashGet for downloading big files from the Internet .
If you notice carefully , some websites add an orange colored icon in the browser address bar ( go to cnn.com to see a live example ) - this icon means that you can get updates about new articles posted on that site automatically without having to visit the site again and again .
If that ’s the case , go to Feed My Inbox and type the address of that website - you ’ll be notified automatically via email .

Advertisement Millions of Chinese people around the world are celebrating the start of Lunar New Year , the most important festival in the Chinese calendar .
In many homes and towns , the Year of the Ox was greeted in traditional style with firecrackers , parties , feasts and incense offerings at temples .
But correspondents say the mood this year was subdued , with many people expressing concern about the economy .
Vietnam is also celebrating its New Year festival - known as Tet .
The BBC's Michael Bristow , in Beijing , says many people in the Chinese capital braved bitterly cold weather to light incense sticks at temples and pray for a prosperous year to come .
He says the police cordoned off roads around the most popular temples , where beggars traditionally gather to benefit from people 's new - year generosity .
In pictures : Lunar New Year Reflecting widespread concern about the state of the economy , 55 - year - old Beijing resident Liu Tieying told the BBC he felt the economy would be a major problem in the coming year .
But he sounded an optimistic note for China , saying he believed the situation would be worse in other countries .
The BBC's Jill McGivering says the Year of the Ox is traditionally associated with calm , fortitude and success through toil .
But she says China has already seen an outbreak of protests and rioting associated with job losses and factory closures - so one of the biggest challenges for the Communist Party will be to maintain public order and confidence in the year to come .
China 's state - run Xinhua news agency announced on Monday that the government is to help train as many as one million jobless college graduates over the next three years .
Graduates will also be offered small loans to help them start their own businesses .
Analysts say the moves show the government 's increasing concern with rising unemployment .
China 's top politicians made high - profile trips over the Lunar New Year holiday .
State television broadcast images of Chinese President Hu Jintao smiling as a baby kissed his cheek on a visit to Jinggangshan , a former base for the communists during the Chinese civil war .
In a speech , he promised more " equal development across society " .
Meanwhile , Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited survivors of last May 's earthquake which devastated large parts of Sichuan province .
Chinese people in cities across the world are also marking the festival - with lanterns , incense , lion dances and firecrackers lighting up places as far apart as London , Jakarta and Vancouver .

Now we know why McCain wo n’t let her speak to the media and answer a real question .
She ’s even more reckless than he is .
What an idiotic thing to say .
Then again , she did warn that we might have to declare war on Russia too .
Though it ’s not clear if war with Russia comes before or after the next Great Depression .
Perhaps they ’re simultaneous .
From AP :
Asked whether there ’s a risk of another Great Depression if Congress does n’t approve a $ 700 billion bailout package , Palin said : “ Unfortunately , that is the road that America may find itself on . ”
Here ’s Palin ’s infamous threat to declare war on Russia :

Alternative Fuels Could Deplete Water Supplies
October 20th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
A recent study from the University of Texas at Austin puts a wrench in the recent advancements of the biofuels world .
According to researchers at the university , producing biofuels or hydrogen en masse may require the use of much more water than conventional petroleum - based fuels .
The researchers analyzed the amount of water withdrawn ( consumed and returned to the source ) and consumed ( not returned to the source ) per mile traveled by a car running on conventional petroleum , biofuels , hydrogen , and electricity .
The results of the study are unsettling — vehicles running on hydrogen and water produced with electricity withdraw 20 times more water and consume 5 times more water than vehicles using conventional petroleum .
And biofuels derived from irrigated crops such as corn use up to 3 times more water per mile than conventional fuels .
Fortunately , not all fuels use quite as much water as irrigated crops .
Non-irrigated biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable sources use the same amount of water as petroluem .
So while alternative fuels are necessary today , it may be wise to hold off on mass production until non-irrigated biofuels are more common and a renewable energy infrastructure is in place .

Who knew Chairman Dean had such a good , and dead - pan , sense of humor ?
It was $ 1,900 here and $ 10,000 there .
On Friday , it all added up to a sentence of 55 years in state prison for 42 - year - old Johnnie Miles , whose criminal record — of bad checks and financial fraud — dates to when she was 14 years old , according to court officials .
A month ago , a six - member Indian River County jury found the 29th Avenue resident innocent of the latest charges against her : defrauding a store out of $ 7,500 during a three - month period in 2007 .
But under state rules , Circuit Court Judge Dan Vaughn was allowed to take another look at the facts in the latest case .
That ’s because she was on probation for a 2003 conviction for grand theft and fraud in Indian River County .
Because of her record , Vaughn gave her the maximum for probation violation : 11 five - year state jail terms , all to be servedconsecutively , adding up to 55 years .
Each five - year term is for the 11 offenses for which she served four years in state prison .
Her record goes back even further , including an additional 20 felony fraud and theft convictions , nine petty theft convictions and seven misdemeanor cases , according to county court records .
“ She is one of the most notorious thieves ” in the county , said Assistant State Attorney Adam Chrzan , who handled her latest case .
Read
Her record , the attorney said , includes such things as making purchases using just credit card numbers .
She told a store owner she was the victim of an identify theft and her card was stolen .
In the recent trial , Chrzan said the jury may have been swayed by testimony that a person identifying herself as Johnnie Miles called Riverside Bank claiming her checkbook and credit card were stolen , leading to fraudulent charges .
During sentencing on Friday , Miles made no comment .

In 1989 , I was a grad student nearing completion at Carnegie Mellon .
Kavi Arya gave a talk on “ functional animation ” , using lazy lists .
I was awe - struck with the elegance and power of that simple idea , and I ’ve been hooked on functional animation ever since .
At the end of Kavi ’s talk , John Reynolds offered a remark , roughly as follows :
You can think of sequences as functions from the natural numbers .
Have you thought about functions from the reals instead ?
Doing so might help with the awkwardness with interpolation .
I knew at once I ’d heard a wonderful idea , so I went back to my office , wrote it down , and promised myself that I would n’t think about Kavi ’s work and John ’s insight until my dissertation was done .
Otherwise , I might never have finished .
A year or so later , at Sun Microsystems , I started working on functional animation , which then grew into functional reactive programming ( FRP ) .
In the dozens of variations on FRP I ’ve played with over the last 15 years , John ’s refinement of Kavi ’s idea has always been the heart of the matter for me .
Lately , I ’ve been rethinking FRP yet again , and I ’m very excited about where it ’s leading me .
The semantic model of FRP has been based on behaviors of infinite duration and , mostly on absolute time .
Recently I realized that some problems of non-modular interaction could be elegantly addressed by switching to finite duration and relative time , and by adopting a co-monadic approach .
Upcoming post will explore these ideas .

The Phone Company
For a long time — the entire decade of the ’90s and the first few years of this decade — the story of Apple was the story of a company searching for a way to be something other than “ the Mac company ” .
From a financial perspective of revenue and profit , the Mac was Apple , and Apple was the Mac .
This was problematic on two fronts .
First , it was an “ all of their eggs in one basket ” scenario .
If the Mac had sunk , the company would have gone under .
Second , the potential for growth was severely limited by the fantastic success of Windows .
The iPod was Apple ’s first breakthrough success after the Macintosh .
During some quarters in recent years , iPod revenue has run even with or ( in holiday quarters ) exceeded Mac revenue .
The iPod solved both of the problems Apple faced as “ the Mac company ” : its eggs were now divided between two baskets , and they ’d entered a field with room for significant growth .
Last year , immediately after its debut , Steve Jobs began describing the iPhone as the third leg of the company .
The numbers Apple released yesterday for its fourth quarter of financial year 2008 ( July through September ) back this up .
The main thing you must keep in mind regarding Apple ’s reported numbers for the iPhone is that they ’re using subscription - based accounting for it .
When you buy a Mac or an iPod today , Apple reports the entire sale as revenue for this quarter .
When you buy an iPhone today , however , Apple reports the revenue split evenly over eight quarters .
Apple ’s interpretation of U.S. accounting regulations is that this is the only way they can provide free feature upgrades over the course of two years .
That ’s why iPhone OS 2.0 was a free update for existing iPhone owners , but a paid update for iPod Touch owners .
In the long run , Apple does n’t make any more or less money from this .
It ’s just a method of accounting for the money they have made .
( Indirectly , Apple clearly hopes that it helps sell additional iPhones , on the grounds that people enjoy getting “ free ” OS upgrades . )
But in the short run , Apple ’s iPhone revenue and profit are underrepresented in the company ’s quarterly results — only one - eighth of the revenue from iPhones sold during the just - completed quarter appear in the quarter ’s results .
It also makes the iPhone numbers hard to compare against those of the Mac and iPod .
So , Apple is now providing two sets of quarterly numbers .
First , GAAP results with subscription - based accounting for iPhones and Apple TV .
( GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles . )
Second , a new set of numbers — non-GAAP results — which , more or less , show what Apple ’s quarterly numbers would look like if they were n’t using subscription - based accounting for the iPhone and Apple TV .
Here ’s what Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said during his opening remarks of yesterday ’s analyst conference call :
As we reported in our press release , iPhone unit sales grew significantly in the September quarter , resulting in a material increase in the amount of iPhone revenue and product costs that had been deferred for recognition in future periods .
Specifically , deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV sales grew to $ 5.8 billion at the end of the September quarter , an increase of nearly $ 3.8 billion from the end of the June quarter .
If iPhone revenue was not deferred , iPhone would have represented 39 % of Apple ’s revenue in the September quarter .
This means , I think , that Apple generated more revenue last quarter from iPhone sales than from either Mac or iPod sales .
The iPhone , just 15 months old , is perhaps already the strongest of the company ’s three legs .
And it ’s not like iPod or Mac sales are down — compared to the year - ago quarter , Mac sales are up 21 percent in terms of units and 17 percent in terms of revenue , and iPods are up 8 percent in units and 3 percent in revenue .
And in terms of the momentum of the iPhone OS as a platform , keep in mind that the iPod Touch is put on the books as an iPod , not an iPhone .
( And Apple does not break those “ iPod ” numbers out into specific models ; no one other than Apple ’s top executives know exactly how many iPod Touches have been sold . )
Steve Jobs rarely appears on Apple ’s quarterly analyst calls .
I ’m pretty sure you can count on one hand Jobs ’s appearances on these calls over the last 10 years .
Typically , Jobs has appeared when Apple has bad news to announce .
( His appearance yesterday seems to have been about addressing Apple ’s plans for weathering the current worldwide economic downturn . )
Here ’s what Jobs had to say in his prepared remarks regarding Apple ’s revenue and profit from the iPhone :
As you can see , the non-GAAP financial results are truly stunning .
By eliminating subscription accounting , adjusted sales for the quarter were $ 11.68 billion , 48 % higher than the reported revenue of $ 7.9 billion , while adjusted income was $ 2.44 billion , 115 % higher than the reported net income of $ 1.14 billion .
Adjusted net income that is more than double our reported income — if this is n’t stunning , I do n’t know what is , all due to the incredible success of the iPhone 3G .
I would like to now highlight two remarkable milestones resulting from iPhone ’s outstanding performance last quarter .
The first is that Apple beat RIM .
In their most recent quarter , Research in Motion , or RIM , reported selling 6.1 million BlackBerry devices .
Compared to our most recent quarter sales of 6.9 million iPhones , Apple outsold RIM last quarter and this is a milestone for us .
RIM is a good company that makes good products and so it is surprising that after only 15 months in the market , we could outsell them in any quarter .
But even more remarkable is this — measured by revenues , Apple has become the world ’s third - largest mobile phone supplier .
I know this sounds crazy , but it ’s true — as measured in revenues , not units , Apple has become the third largest mobile phone supplier .
Let ’s look at the ranking —
Nokia is clearly number one at 12.7 billion ; Samsung number two at 5.9 billion ; Apple is number three at 4.6 billion ; Sony Ericsson , number four at 4.2 ; LG , number five at 3.4 billion ; Motorola , number six at 3.2 ; and RIM number seven at 2.1 .
Pretty amazing .
So , last quarter : ( 1 ) the iPhone was a bigger revenue and profit generator than either the iPod or Mac ; ( 2 ) Apple sold more iPhones than RIM sold BlackBerrys ; and ( 3 ) Apple trailed only Nokia and Samsung in worldwide mobile phone handset revenue ( and they ’re not far behind Samsung ) .
Jobs followed with this caveat :
Now , both of these things , beating RIM in units and becoming the third largest mobile supplier in revenues are amazing feats but part of this was the result of expanding into over 50 countries and there ’s no guarantee that sustained sales will equal initial sales .
And who knows what the future results will be , given the worldwide economic slowdown but we actually outsold RIM last quarter and ranked as the third largest mobile phone supplier in revenues .
Not bad for being in the market for only 15 months .
He ’s right that no one knows what the results will be for the current quarter ( which started three weeks ago , and runs through the end of December ) — but we can make an educated guess .
Because it encompasses the entire holiday season , Apple ’s October - December quarter has always been the strongest for iPod sales .
A year ago , iPod sales went from 10.2 to 22.1 million from Q4 ( Jul. –Sep. ) to Q1 ( Oct.–Dec . ) .
Two years ago , they went from 8.7 to 21.0 million .
Three years ago , 6.5 to 14.0 million .
In terms of a multiplier , that works out to 2.17 , 2.41 , and 2.15 , respectively .
I.e. , Apple consistently sells a little more than twice as many iPods in the holiday quarter than in the preceding quarter .
We only have one year of data for the iPhone .
Last year , Apple sold 1.1 million iPhones in Q4 2007 .
It went on to sell 2.3 million iPhones in Q1 2008 — a multiplier of 2.09 , very much in line with previous years of holiday - quarter iPod sales .
So , it seems quite possible that Apple could sell twice as many iPhones during the current quarter as it did in the just - reported quarter .
If they did , that would be 13.8 million iPhones .
Even if they fall short of that mark , they seem poised to sell about 20 million iPhones in calendar year 2008 — more than double their oft - stated goal of 10 million .
Many analysts doubted that 10 million iPhone goal for the year ; Apple might in fact sell 10 million iPhones in a single quarter .
Even if sales are flat in the current quarter , it seems almost certain they ’ll sell more than 10 million units in the first six months after the iPhone 3G went on sale .
As for where this growth positions the iPhone industry - wide , recall Microsoft ’s projections for Windows Mobile licenses this year :
The warning signs were there .
After boldly proclaiming that it would sell “ more than ” 20 million licenses to its Windows Mobile operating system by the end of its fiscal year on June 30 , Microsoft later scaled that prediction back to “ nearly ” 20 million units .
This week , however , the software giant conceded it did not hit its target :
The company sold just 18 million units in the fiscal year .
So not only is Windows Mobile growth significantly slower than what Microsoft had publicly anticipated , but the iPhone seems set to surpass unit sales of all Windows Mobile phones combined next year .
In fact , given that Apple acknowledged during yesterday ’s conference call that , including October sales to date , they ’ve already surpassed 10 million iPhones sold for calendar year 2008 , the iPhone may well already be outselling all Windows Mobile phones combined .
The entire iPhone platform is only 15 months old .
The cheapest model still costs $ 199 .
The room for growth in this market is unlike anything Apple has ever seen .
So the question is : Despite continuing strong iPod sales and record - breaking Mac sales , how long until the iPhone is undeniably the primary product and platform made by Apple ?
My answer : Not long .
And I think Apple ’s executive team sees it the same way .
With the mainstream news media and the blogosphere caught in the pre-election excitement , I saw no viable path to a rational discussion .
Rather than step clumsily into the sound - bite culture , I turned away whenever the microphones were thrust into my face .
I sat it out .
Now that the election is over , I want to say as plainly as I can that the character invented to serve this drama was n’t me , not even close .
Here are the facts :
I never killed or injured anyone .
I did join the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s , and later resisted the draft and was arrested in nonviolent demonstrations .
I became a full - time antiwar organizer for Students for a Democratic Society .
In 1970 , I co-founded the Weather Underground , an organization that was created after an accidental explosion that claimed the lives of three of our comrades in Greenwich Village .
The Weather Underground went on to take responsibility for placing several small bombs in empty offices  the ones at the Pentagon and the United States Capitol were the most notorious  as an illegal and unpopular war consumed the nation .
The Weather Underground crossed lines of legality , of propriety and perhaps even of common sense .
Our effectiveness can be  and still is being  debated .
We did carry out symbolic acts of extreme vandalism directed at monuments to war and racism , and the attacks on property , never on people , were meant to respect human life and convey outrage and determination to end the Vietnam war .
Peaceful protests had failed to stop the war .
So we issued a screaming response .
But it was not terrorism ; we were not engaged in a campaign to kill and injure people indiscriminately , spreading fear and suffering for political ends .
I cannot imagine engaging in actions of that kind today .
And for the past 40 years , I ’ve been teaching and writing about the unique value and potential of every human life , and the need to realize that potential through education .
Arthur is an alleged john , a man who patronizes prostitutes .
After his arrest on September 5 , 2008 , a photograph of this 41 - year - old appeared on the Web site of the Chicago Police Department .
Arthur ( not his real name ) was far from the only person so branded on this Internet portal .
Samuel , 59 , and José , 34 , ( whose names were also changed to protect their privacy ) were on this online pillory for a month after their September 5 arrests .
Last month , we curled up with a pair of headphones and a 1.0 release candidate of Songbird , an open - source media player based on Mozilla technology .
As a cross- platform music player built with Mozilla 's trademark extensibility in mind , Songbird soared with its integration of services like concert ticket notifiers , lyric downloading , and artist bios .
Today the official Songbird 1.0 is shipping , and it even supports DRM - protected iTunes Store files , so we took another look at the feature roadmap and how the final version shaped up .
For a recap , Songbird is available for Windows XP / Vista , Linux , and Intel - based Mac OS X PCs .
The app takes an iTunes - meets - Firefox approach , as it is based on Mozilla 's XML User Interface Language ( XUL ) and Gecko rendering engine that powers Firefox , but presents one 's music library and add - ons with a UI inspired very much by iTunes .
The integration of a tabbed web browser , official add - on support , open architecture , and a focus on playing well with the rest of the music - loving web , however , are what really help Songbird to soar above the competition .
Songbird ships with six add - ons that a brief setup wizard helps users to get started with : iPod Device Support , QuickTime Playback , SHOUTcast Radio , Concerts , Last.fm , mashTape .
This means that , out of the box , Songbird can synchronize with Apple 's iPod ( including the latest generation released in September ) as well as a multitude of other devices and cell phones .
Sorry , iPhone , iPod touch , and Zune owners : support for your devices is still on the way .
Other notable add - ons include Concerts , which uses Songkick to check for when library artists are giving concerns in major cities across a handful of countries .
The Last.fm add - on allows users to " scrobble " a list of songs to the Last . fm community for music discovery and socializing , and mashTape collects artist bios , photos , and videos from around the web .
Songbird 1.0 running the
Songbird 1.0 running the Sparkle theme , mashTape , and LyricMaster add -ons
In addition to having over 70 add - ons available for launch , one of Songbird 's greatest strengths is its customizable UI for displaying the content that all these add - ons aggregate .
Collapsible panels on the top , bottom , and right side of Songbird 's window can display add - ons that bring lyrics , a Cover - Flow - style or unique Photo browser for album art , mashTape content , and anything else you can find in the add - on directory .
A handful of alternative themes can also bring more style to Songbird , or even make it feel more at home on your OS of choice .
After taking Songbird 's official 1.0 version on a magic carpet ride , it really feels like a solid release that fixed all of the release candidate bugs we ran into .
Songbird imported our entire iTunes library perfectly , complete with DRM store files and metadata like song ratings and play counts , and stayed in step whenever we made changes in iTunes .
Scanning our library of 9,370 tracks from nearly 1,000 artists for concert tickets in the Chicago area was a snap , and playing songs from our 4G iPod nano or syncing new playlists to it both went without a hitch .
Songbird 's Concerts add - on makes it easy to spend as much money as possible seeing artists live
A number of other features are still on their way , however , including some of Songbird 's most promising potential as a true media hub .
Besides the aforementioned pending device support , Songbird cannot yet watch folders for new media , automatically integrate media from any of the major MP3 outlets like Amazon 's MP3 Downloads store and Rhapsody , or rip CDs .
On that last point , though , the project says that one - quarter of Songbird 's users have already left the realm of physical media behind long ago .
and about three - quarters of Songbird 's other users are willing to rely on other apps for ripping CDs and grabbing new music .
Features for importing metadata and album artwork from web services are still in the works , and Songbird 1.0 is definitely a music player , as video playback and organization is on the project 's lengthy roadmap .
Other more minor features , such as the ability to accept commands from keyboards with media keys , are also not present .
Is Songbird 1.0 a viable music player replacement for iTunes , Windows Media Player , and other incumbents ?
As long as you do n't need to manage videos and are n't nuts for the play / pause key on your keyboard , we can answer " definitely . "
After a two - year journey , Songbird 1.0 is a serious music player competitor , firmly grounded in the vast potential of an open - source community and a focus on incorporating the web into the music experience .

In the realm of politics , I 'm more a voyeur than a participant .
Or maybe I 'm like the people who slow down for an accident in hopes of seeing blood on the highway .
I do vote in the major elections , and I can't keep myself from taking sides , even in races where there are no good choices .
At least I do n't fool myself into thinking this activity is worthwhile .
I 'm convinced that elections , like Las Vegas casino games , are rigged in favor of the house .
But I was n't always that cynical .
I got interested in politics at an early age .
As a child , I often eavesdropped on my grandfather 's political discussions .
In grade school , I was reading Time magazine , watching the evening news , and following the “ progress ” of the Vietnam War .
At that time I believed the talking heads on TV .
There was “ a light at the end of the tunnel , ” so we had to “ support our boys in uniform . ”
Tragically , my father succumbed to cancer when I was ten .
As a result I developed a strong interest in religion .
I read the Bible and began to wonder if the War was morally justifiable .
A few years later , our pastor , who was atypically liberal for our small town , invited a draft dodger to speak to my church school class .
This caused several parents to leave the congregation in a rage , but I realized the reverend was right .
I became a pacifist , and supported McGovern in ' 72 despite the taunts of my conservative peers .
In high school , I published an “ underground ” newspaper .
At that time , I actually called myself a Marxist .
In other ways I was a more typical 1970 's longhair .
When I researched the Socialist Workers Party , I discovered that with respect to actual partying , they were stodgier than the Republicans .
So I was the proverbial rebel without a cause .
Then one day in the college library , I happened upon a book called The Libertarian Alternative , a collection of essays edited by Tibor Machan .
I especially enjoyed the parts that showed that the history we 'd learned in public school was largely a fraud , and that the “ progressive ” era had served to empower Big Business , not restrict it .
Another book that greatly influenced me was written by an investment analyst named Harry Browne : How I Found Freedom In An Unfree World .
I only had one problem with Browne 's philosophy - he asserted that political activity was a waste of time .
Back then , as a neophyte and a true believer , I was convinced that the message of freedom was so powerful that we 'd soon turn the tide of big government .
Libertarianism being a continuation of the ideals of the Founding Fathers , the American people would understand and be drawn to our cause .
After graduation , I got married and moved to Phoenix , Arizona .
Much of my spare time was devoted to politics ( though my wife never shared my enthusiasm . )
Despite Browne 's admonition , I became very active in the Arizona Libertarian Party .
I circulated petitions , waved protest signs , registered voters , and served as secretary of the ALP 's executive committee .
I ran an earnest but disorganized campaign for state legislature , earning a humiliating three percent of the vote .
Worst of all , Ron Paul , our great hope for change in the 1988 Presidential race , made a very disappointing showing , far less than Ed Clark 's 1980 vote totals .
Shortly thereafter , the Arizona LP self - destructed in an ideological dispute over campaign financing .
I decided that Browne had been right all along .
I dropped out of LP activism , but never lost my interest in politics .
I read voraciously and wrote inflammatory articles and letters to the editor , figuring I could still influence people for the better .
I was astounded when Harry Browne turned on his principles and ran for President , not once , but twice .
His campaigns were among the most corrupt and inept in Libertarian Party history .
These events made me doubt that we libertarians could achieve anything , even if the cards were n't stacked against us .
Of course , there 's always false hope , which came in the form of the Ron Paul Revolution .
I had met Dr. Paul in 1988 .
I greatly admired the man , but was not optimistic for his candidacy .
The ensuing hoopla over his second Presidential campaign took me by surprise .
Despite Paul 's lack of charisma , and his focus on obscure ( to the average American ) issues such as the Federal Reserve , people latched on to his campaign by the hundreds of thousands .
I think it was less about Paul himself than the times .
After two terms of George W. Bush , people needed a voice of sanity and hope .
In particular , Trevor Lyman 's “ money bombs ” were a stroke of genius .
They actually inspired me to donate , and I have n't given money to any campaign in over a decade .
Of course the establishment press despised Paul , and his movement ran up against the wall of entrenched political interests .
Yes , Paul opened a lot of minds , but many more remained closed .
At our current rate of progress , our great - great - grandchildren may be free – as long as some idiot does n't start a nuclear war in the meantime .
So that 's why I 'm pessimistic about achieving change from within the system .
But as my wife always says , “ Do n't complain unless you have a suggestion for fixing the problem . ”
I have several , which will be the subject of my next column .
Thanks for reading , and feel free to flame away !
Vaughn
Follow up :
Once again , I let my enthusiasm get away with me .
At the time that I wrote my previous column , I had read a article that showed Republican congressional candidates making headway in the polls against their Democratic opponents .
I theorized that it was part of a “ bailout backlash . ”
It appears that this trend was a flash in the pan .
Remember how the media pundits were talking about “ class rage ” ?
Perhaps people did n't realize that the stereotypical roles were reversed , and that many more Democrats voted for the bailout than Republicans .
I was hoping that Americans would punish any representatives who supported this outrage , and vote those incumbents out .
But it appears that most voters have the attention span of a goldfish .
One more thing : it was hilarious to see McCain on television , railing against Obama 's tax plan , expounding on the evil of giving money to people who did n't earn it .
Who voted to give billions of dollars of our tax money to rich bankers to did n't earn it , do n't deserve it , and do n't need it ?
At least Obama is honest about his redistributionist tendencies .
WILSONVILLE , Ore. , Dec. 11 ( UPI ) --
A domestic violence victim in Wilsonville , Ore. , was charged a fee by a tow truck driver for parking in a fire lane while attempting to call 911 , police say .
Police investigators said while the unidentified woman frantically attempted to contact authorities this week after allegedly being beaten by her boyfriend , a Retriever Towing driver prepared to tow her car away , KPTV of Portland , Ore. , said Wednesday .

The unidentified tow truck operator then charged the injured woman at least $ 360 to remove her vehicle from the towing harness , police allege .
A responding police deputy said his requests to the driver not to charge the woman Monday night were ignored .
Retriever Towing owner Gary Coe said his driver could have released the woman 's vehicle and not issued a charge , but stood behind the driver 's decision on the matter .
KPTV said the woman had left the car in the lane after driving to a friend 's apartment following the alleged act of domestic violence .

The Hollywood look - alikes in the Katsu coffee - shop were in agreement : one must already have serious mental problems to dream even of committing suicide after ingesting psychedelic or magic mushrooms .
“ You ’re giggling so much , how can you be depressed enough to kill yourself ? ” argues a Steve Buscemi clone , referring to last year ’s suicide of a French teenager , Gaelle Caroff ( 17 ) , who plunged to her death from the Nemo building , situated over the tunnel to Amsterdam north .
We are discussing the imminent ban on the production and sale of fresh magic mushrooms — which came into effect this week .
The suicide of Caroff , who was on a school trip to Amsterdam , appears to be instrumental in getting the new legislation pushed through .
It is reported that Caroff had a history of psychological problems .
Mark , an Amsterdammer , who resembles a dehydrated cross between Woody Allen and Al Pacino , is nodding : “ Besides , tourists do n’t respect the ‘ shrooms enough .
They ’re here mixing it with lots of alcohol and super strength skunk [ marijuana ] — it ’s bound to have a bad effect on you .
You ’re bound to see evil , ” he says .
Having just spent a pleasant afternoon wandering around nearby Vondel Park after sharing a batch of Colombian mushrooms ( psilocybe cubensis colombian ) with Spliff , the pet goldfish , I could only concur .
An unprecedented fascination with the shapes and colours of tree leaves turning ochre as winter approached meant we did n’t get too far into the park ’s 45ha .
Having entered Vondel Park — named after 17th - century poet and dramatist Joost van den Vondel — in the south , near the Van Gogh museum , we did n’t make it all the way to Amsterdam ’s Filmmuseum in the Vondel Park Pavillion .
An Italian Renaissance - style mansion built in 1881 , it is situated to the north of the park and is the Dutch national centre for cinematography with more than 35 000 films dating back to 1898 .
At times , sitting on a park bench , the atoms of a tree ’s bark or one ’s clothes appeared to break free from their regular bond and dance away from their usually sober shapes with delicious infidelity .
Questions about what the socially conformist eye sees , rather than panic , followed .
Although Spliff did find an errant terrier ignoring his exasperated master ’s call to “ heel ” while attempting to mount the ducks in a nearby lake , she had no such luck with The Fish , Pablo Picasso ’s 1965 sculpture , found in the park .
The only unnerving moments came when leaving the Vondel Park and heading for Katsu .
With cyclists dictating the rules of engagement on Amsterdam ’s roads and paths , attempting not to be overrun by the ubiquitous chicks - on - bikes felt the hardest part of the ‘ shroom trip .
Coming from a city like Durban , where cyclists often complain of being persecuted ( and sometimes intentionally run over ) , the paramount right of the cyclist is rather disconcerting for pedestrians perpetually unsure of where to walk .
This makes Amsterdam — for all its variety of bio , skunk and hashish — an unfriendly city for stoners intent on skinning up .
Pedestrian paranoia is a horrible thing .
And you ’re usually awakened from a stoned reverie by an irritated bicycle bell seconds too late .
Back at Katsu , the wizened Mark , nicknamed Hout ( wood ) , asserts that Amsterdam ’s reputation for having a liberal attitude towards drugs and sex means tourists feel they have a licence “ to get off their tits here ” .
This after drawing on a vaporiser filled with Big Buddha Cheese for what seemed like an entire winter — the time it apparently took Van Gogh to paint The Potato Eaters .
But it is a valid point .
By Thursday the city starts filling up with groups of British chavs seemingly intent on wreaking havoc during a stag weekend , more laidback Spanish stoners and loads of wide - eyed American pie .
Earlier that day , while en route to the Kokopelli ( Conscious Dreams ) smart shop on Warmoesstraat near the city ’s red - light district to buy our cranial mash , we pass two Brits clutching beer cans and packages of mushrooms :
“ Oh fuck ’em and the focking warnings — they say that to everybody .
Let ’s get ’em down , ” one said to the other .
We ’d chosen the Colombian ‘ shrooms , described as having a “ strong visual effect ” and being milder than the Philosopher ’s Stone ( psilocybe tampanesis : a truffle - like variety promising a chattier trip and less visuals ) or the Ecuadorian mushrooms ( psilocybe cubensis ecuadorian ) which provide the “ strongest visionary state of consciousness ” .
All were available at Kokopelli , two weeks before the ban .
Last Friday the smart - shop owners association , Vereniging Landelijk Overleg Smartshops ( Vlos ) legally challenged the ban in The Hague .
The challenge was rejected , but Vlos secretary Paul van Oyen said : “ We will probably appeal in the case of the interim judgement of the high court judge . ”
Van Oyen said the ban would have a “ pretty tough ” effect on smart shops as “ more than 50 % of their turnover is in magic mushrooms ” .
He said although the sector was small , employing a few hundred people , job losses were expected .
He also felt the clampdown on mushrooms was part of a broader “ hardening ” of government ’s attitude because of “ Christian fundamentalism and ideology ” .
The Christian Democratic Appeal holds power in Holland .
Between 500 000 and 1,5 - million doses of paddos ( the Dutch nickname for mushrooms , from the word paddastoel ) were estimated to be sold annually in the Netherlands until the ban on December 1 .
Amsterdam ’s health services released a study in January , which found that of the 148 cases addressed by emergency services between 2004 and 2006 , 134 involved foreigners .
Britons formed the largest group of those .
Vlos , which has called for greater regulation of the sector rather than an outright ban — which it says will lead to mushrooms going underground , leading to less regulation of sale — asserts that this is a “ very small number of incidents ” .
“ Moreover , these incidents can not be traced back to the exclusive use of ‘ shrooms .
There has been no scientific investigation of such incidents nor has there been any toxicological examination , ” it complained in a statement prior to the ban .
Although dried mushrooms are illegal in the Netherlands , fresh mushrooms were available until this week because it was impossible to ascertain the level of psilocybin , the psychoactive alkaloid in them .
T he crackdown on teen drivers announced yesterday by the Ontario government has two elements .
The first is what it does – which is widely supported .
The second is how it came to be – which is a little unsettling .
There is a sense that Premier Dalton McGuinty 's government has acted with an alacrity over the deaths of three affluent white young people that 's lacking when , say , the bodies are poor or black and similarly victims of their own bad choices or contempt for laws .
There is also at least the appearance that the premier 's ear and personal attention are more accessible to those with the wherewithal to mount personalized advertising campaigns than they are to those without .
In July , three young Toronto men were killed when , after an after - noon of drinking at a lakeside club , their speeding sports car crashed through a guardrail into a river in Muskoka .
A female friend , who kicked free of the submerged car , was the only survivor .
Soon afterward , the father of the 20 - year - old driver began a campaign – full - page newspaper ads addressed in large type to the premier – for tougher restrictions on young drivers .
This despite the fact that laws banning the conduct engaged in that day already existed and that the father admitted to injudicious indulgence and insufficient supervision of a son with a history of acting as if those laws did n't apply to him .
Even so , there can be little doubt that the ads – " Dear Mr. McGuinty , My Son is Dead " – got the premier 's personal attention .
There was a meeting between the two men in September .
There was a personal phone call from the premier last week to inform the father the legislation introduced yesterday was coming .
McGuinty has sons not much older than the victims .
It was obvious he could easily put himself in the father 's shoes .
" It was a very compelling story , " he told reporters yesterday .
" Here 's a guy , he lost his son ...
This was a broken man . "
By the standards of government , the action taken yesterday a-mounts to lightning response – motivated in no small measure , it would seem , by the premier 's personal identification with a father of similar class and circumstance .
Not only that , the premier said that if certain obvious discriminations in the legislation – some likely to draw human rights or constitutional complaints – had to be perpetrated against young drivers to keep them safe , so be it .
" If that means a modest restriction on their freedoms until they reach the age of 22 , then , as a dad , I am more than prepared to do that . "
Because these were , as the premier 's heavy use of the first - person plural made clear , " our " children , " special " children .
" We 're going to take special steps , special measures , to protect our children . "
How more empathetic and prompt was the premier 's response on this issue than his reaction to , say , African Canadian mothers pleading for action over the last few years because their sons were dying in the streets to violence .
Some of these mothers said it was the alienation of young black children from their earliest school days that was , in part , to blame .
Some argued that Africentric schools , even on a trial basis , were worth a try , given the horrific cost in lost lives and family heartbreak .
On that issue , most advocates had less luck getting face time with the premier .
They also did n't hear the sort of " if - it - saves - one - life - it 's - worth - it " argument being made yesterday in defence of the driving legislation or any " in-cases - of - health - and - safety - discrimination - is-okay " explanations being uttered by the premier .

Apple announced Tuesday that Macworld 2009 will be the last Macworld show the corporation will attend .
Steve Jobs wo n't be appearing , either , which once again raises questions about the CEO 's health .
" Apple is reaching more people in more ways than ever before , so like many companies , trade shows have become a very minor part of how Apple reaches its customers , " Apple said in a press release .
Apple said Jobs would not appear Jan. 6 for his traditional keynote to announce new products at the show : Philip Schiller , Apple senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , will take the CEO 's place .
This should come as a surprise to Apple fanatics and investors alike , who will , without a doubt , bring up discussion about Jobs ' health :
The CEO is a pancreatic - cancer survivor .
He made his last public appearance Oct. 14 to unveil new MacBooks .
" Whoa , the end of an era , " tweeted Bruce Evans , better known as " Snaggy , " co-author of the popular web comic Joy of Tech .
Reacting immediately to Apple 's announcement , another fan published a humorous press release saying Apple had canceled Christmas .
In the weeks before Macworld Expo , Apple 's annual trade show , the tech media is filled with predictions about what product Jobs will unveil in his keynote address .
Consumer - tech web sites live - blog the speech as it happens , generating their biggest traffic of the year .
And the next day , practically every media outlet covers the announcements .
Harvard business professor David Yoffie has said the introduction of the iPhone resulted in headlines worth $ 400 million in free advertising .
In fact , part of the joy of being an Apple customer is anticipating the surprises that Santa Steve brings to Macworld Expo every January .
Apple is pulling out of Macworld as its retail stores grow rapidly :
The corporation has expanded from just two stores in 2001 to 240 retail locations worldwide to date .
Before the proliferation of Apple stores ,
Macworld Expo was Apple 's major outlet to make contact with the public and give exposure to its products .
Since the Apple brand has become so popular , the company has been scaling back on trade shows , which is why Apple plans its final appearance at Macworld for 2009 .
Though Apple is backing out , host IDG World Expo said Macworld already still plans to return for another show in January 2010 .
" We 're on track for a terrific show this year with strong attendance numbers and nearly 500 exhibitors showcasing their products at this January 's event , " said Paul Kent , general manager of IDG World Expo .
" We look forward to many successful years of Macworld to come . "
Macworld Expo was first held in January 1985 in San Francisco , and was subsequently hosted twice a year on the East and West coasts .
Apple pulled out of the East Coast show in 2003 , effectively killing it , though it struggled on for a few more years .
Apple cited the same reasons for bowing out then : Growing traffic at its retail stores .
Macworld sister shows are also held in Paris and London , but the Tokyo show ended in 2002 .
Since 1997 , Macworld has drawn huge attention , thanks to Jobs , who took to the stage to introduce new products .
And as Apple has grown , so has Macworld Expo :
After the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 , the show saw a nearly 20 percent increase in attendance , according to IDG , and a further 10 percent increase in 2008 .
Apple 's move could appear troubling for IDG , the company that owns the Macworld conference as well as the publication that goes by the same name .
In addition to Macworld , IDG World Expo also produces the E3 Media gaming show , LinuxWorld and the DEMO tech conference .
" On the one hand , it 's quite a surprise , " said Dan Moren , an associate editor at Macworld magazine .
" I think we 've all started to think that Macworld and Steve would be there forever , even despite the questions about his health .
On the other hand , the way they lay it out in their press release makes sense from a business perspective ....
I 'm certainly disappointed by the decision , though I can understand why they 're doing it . "
Apple did not immediately return phone calls for comment .

Computer Science , at a deep and fundamental level , is broken , and that applies not only to software but to hardware .
One of the reasons that I have this feeling is that after programming for the past 25 years the field has n't really changed .

You could substitute ' Windows API ' or ' Borland CGI ' for ' HTML and CSS ' and you'd be having the same exact conversations I had 15 or 20 years ago .

GAZA CITY , Gaza ( CNN ) -- A Palestinian envoy called on the United Nations to condemn the deadly violence in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes on Hamas militants entered a second day Sunday .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told CNN that airstrikes into Gaza could expand .

" There is no justification for punishing 1.5 million in the Gaza Strip because of the actions of a few , " Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters Saturday before entering a U.N. Security Council meeting scheduled for 10 p.m. ET .
" We hope we do n't fail in having a reaction from the Security Council tonight . "
Israeli airstrikes continued pounding targets in Hamas - ruled Gaza Sunday , killing at least 225 and injuring 400 , in what Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said was a response to escalating rocket attacks against southern Israel .
Yet Hamas blamed Israel for the artillery exchange , accusing it of violating a cease - fire intended to stem violence in the region .
Barak said the Israeli attacks would continue as long as necessary until Hamas militants were ready to " change their behavior . "
" This will not be a short operation .
The war on terrorism is an ongoing one , and we will have to stand firm in order to change the situation in the south , " Barak said Saturday .
An Egypt - brokered cease - fire between Hamas and Israel expired December 19 .
Barak told CNN that Israel was compelled to respond with force after evacuating Gaza three years ago " to the last square inch " only to face continuous attacks .
" We have to experience shelling and rocket attacks on innocent civilians , that 's something we will not accept , " he told CNN .
" I am confident that the American government would not have waited one day before they would have responded if San Diego [ California ] would have been bombed or shelled or rocketed from Tijuana [ Mexico ] with thousands of rockets . "
Hamas vowed to retaliate .
" We will stand up , we will defend our own people , we will defend our land , and we will not give up , " senior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said .
Read reactions to Israel 's strike on Gaza »
Hamdan also denied accusations that Hamas had provoked Israel attacks by violating the cease - fire with rocket attacks .
" Hamas did not fire rockets through the cease - fire .
It 's clear that the one who violated the cease - fire is the Israelis , " Hamdan told CNN .
" For half the period of cease - fire , they closed all the checkpoints , and they killed 28 Palestinians . "
The exchange of accusations came as bodies piled up on the streets of Gaza City , where hospitals and medical personnel were overwhelmed by the influx of wounded .
Palestinian medical sources said that 225 people had been killed and 400 people injured , many of them in serious to critical condition .
" People are suffering and dying because of shortages of medical equipment , " said Dr. Mahmoud el - Khazndar , who works at Gaza City 's Shifa Hospital .
" The hospital is not accustomed to accept mass casualties like this . "
The Egyptian government sent 20 ambulances and medical personnel to its border with Gaza to help treat and transport the wounded , an Egyptian official said .
Tensions had been building between Hamas and Israel despite the six - month truce .
The tenuous agreement was weakened in recent weeks as violence escalated .
The Arab League condemned the attacks and scheduled an emergency meeting in Cairo , Egypt , on Sunday to discuss the situation .
The meeting is set for 7 p.m. ( noon ET ) .
" The situation is lending itself to escalation , " Secretary General Amr Moussa told CNN International .
" The attacks have resulted in casualties among the civilians , among the young , among the population . "
Watch Moussa 's interview with CNN International »
Moussa said the Arab League would call on the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement or resolution calling on all parties to end violence and enter into mediation .
" Also , we are calling on the Palestinians to close ranks and stop feuds between different organizations in Palestine , " Moussa said , referring to struggles between warring factions struggling for power
Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi also accused Israel of ignoring the terms of the cease - fire that expired December 19 .
" This is certainly a very cruel escalation , a relentless bombardment of a captive civilian population that has already been under siege for months , that has been deprived of basic requirements like food and medicines and fuel and power , " she said from Ramallah in the West Bank .
Watch Ashrawi condemn the airstrikes »
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the United States places the blame for the Israeli military action squarely on Hamas .
" We want the cease - fire to be restored , but we understand that Israel is reacting to the hundreds of rockets that have been fired upon the innocent people of Israel over the last few days , " he said .
" Hamas must end its terrorist activities if it wishes to play a role in the future of the Palestinian people . "

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice also called for the cease - fire to be restored .
" We strongly condemn the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and hold Hamas responsible for breaking the cease - fire and for the renewal of violence there .
The cease - fire must be restored immediately and fully respected , " she said .
iReport.com : Are you there ?
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon was " deeply alarmed " and called for " an immediate halt to all violence , " a spokesman said in a statement .
Israeli military officials accused Hamas militants of firing more than 65 rockets into southern Israel on Wednesday , and the Israeli air force said it killed a Hamas militant whom it accused of helping launch the rockets against Israel .
In a letter Saturday to Ban and the U.N. Security Council stated , Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev said Hamas holds " the sole responsibility for the latest events in Gaza " and claimed Israel was exercising self - defense .
" No country would allow continuous rocketing of its civilian population without taking the necessary actions to stop it , " Shalev said .
" Israel expects the understanding and support of the international community to its actions , as it confronts terrorism and advances the interest of all those who wish that peace and coexistence will prevail in our region . "
The Israeli Defense Forces said Israeli aircraft were attacking " a series of Hamas targets and infrastructure facilities , " including headquarters , training camps and weaponry storage warehouses .

About 50 aircraft targeted more than 100 Hamas sites over the first two rounds of airstrikes Saturday , an IDF spokesman said .
A Gaza - based reporter , whose name was withheld for security reasons , reported that the building housing Hamas - run television station al - Aqsa TV was destroyed early Sunday morning .
The reporters also said a number of Hamas police stations were hit , killing some senior police commanders .
Among those killed were Palestinian Maj. Gen. Tawfeeq
Al - Jaber , a senior commander in the Hamas police force , and Ismail Jabari , who headed the special police force in Gaza , Palestinian sources said .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for patience , insisting that Israel wants to avoid causing an " humanitarian disaster " in Gaza .
" The instructions that we have given to our forces are to refrain from inflicting injury and harm on the innocent , " he said at a news conference with Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
Yet scores of deaths and injuries have been claimed on both sides as aid organizations urged Israel to cease the attacks .
An Israeli woman was killed Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a house in Netivot in southern Israel , about six miles east of Gaza , Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said .
Two other Israelis were in " medium to serious " condition at Soroko Hospital in Bersheba , he said .
Wounded people could be seen lying in the streets of Gaza City , and passers - by were doing what they could to summon help .

The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees urged the Israeli government to stop its bombardment .
" UNRWA recognizes Israel 's legitimate security concerns .
However , its actions should be in conformity with international humanitarian law , and it should not use disproportionate force , " the agency said in a news release .
Saeb Erakat , adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , urged Israeli and Hamas leaders to put another cease - fire in place .
" I believe this is the only way out .
I do n't think this problem can be solved through military means , " he told CNN .
" I do n't think it can be solved through aggression , through violence .
Violence will breed more violence . "
Abbas ' Fatah party government is locked in a power struggle with the Hamas movement .
On Friday , Israel opened three border crossings for the first time in 10 days to allow food , medical supplies and other humanitarian goods into Gaza , but Palestinian rocket attacks continued .
CNN 's Kevin Flower and Elise Labott contributed to this report .

Fox hosts belittle atheists feeling ' left out ' on Christmas David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008
Print This Email This The American Humanist Association ( AHA ) has launched a holiday advertising campaign , with ads in major newspapers and posters on Washington , DC buses proclaiming , " Why believe in a god ?
Just be good for goodness ' sake . "
AHA spokesman Fred Edwords told the Associated Press , " Our reason for doing it during the holidays is there are an awful lot of agnostics , atheists and other types of nontheists who feel a little alone during the holidays because of its association with traditional religion . "
The hosts of Fox and Friends naturally saw this as something to snipe at .
Brian Kilmeade found it particularly hilarious and offered a variety of possible slogans to promote sympathy for the feelings of lonely atheists .
He began with , " A lot of times during the holidays , we do n't think enough about people who do n't think enough about the holidays . "
He then offered , " There 's nobody 's birth to celebrate , so give an atheist a hug . "
His third suggestion was that " atheists should get together and not celebrate all at once . "
But the accumulated paradoxes finally made Kilmeade 's head explode .
" I really do n't understand this story , " he expostulated .
" I do n't understand the campaign .
They do n't want -- leave them alone ! "

" We see snippets of our community and distortions of our community .
So the world has this perspective that somehow Barack and Michelle Obama are different , that we 're unique .
And we 're not .
You just have n't seen us before . "
Source : USA TODAY research ; Michelle : A Biography , by Liza Mundy Enlarge By Wilfredo Lee , AP The Obamas stand together at a Miami rally in October during the presidential campaign .
You could call it " Obamalot . "
That makes some sense .
The incoming presidential couple , Barack and Michelle Obama , bear superficial similarities to John and Jacqueline Kennedy of the 1960s " Camelot " White House — charisma , vigor , her fondness for sheath dresses , for instance .
CELEB STYLE : Incorporate Obama 's fashion sense into your wardrobe
But maybe the most obvious similarity is that many Americans are as excited and curious about her as they are about him .
" People will be riveted , " predicts Donna Brazile , Democratic strategist and CNN analyst .
" She is going to set a record in the amount of attention she will receive . "
President Kennedy once jokingly introduced himself , during a press - frenzied visit to France , as " the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris . "
Someday , the president - elect may have occasion to say the same .
In fact , on the day this month that Barack Obama was announcing important Cabinet picks , a British tabloid reported ( with no apparent evidence ) that he planned to buy his wife an exotic $ 30,000 ring as a thank - you gift .
Exasperated , his transition team had to interrupt actual news to deny fake news .
It was a sign of the hyper - increased focus on the role of first lady in general , and on Michelle in particular , as Americans seek to learn more about her and sort out what kind of first lady she might be and how she might influence public perceptions of her husband 's administration .
Expectations are dizzyingly high .
Most Democrats , and even some Republicans , think she will do an excellent or good job as first lady , according to a Marist poll released Wednesday .
But nearly every first lady has made mistakes — recall the brouhaha over Nancy Reagan 's borrowed designer duds , or the withering criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's handling of a health care task force .
Will any missteps by Michelle Obama be heightened by the increased attention she will get ?
" The first lady has always been a helpmate and sounding board for the president , his most trusted adviser , and that 's always a given , " says Ann Stock , a White House social secretary for President Clinton .
" But it 's a much more public role now " compared with previous generations because of dramatic changes in communication and media .
" Now you see the role model that you did n't see before . "
So what kind of role model will Michelle be ?
Officially , her staff says only that she will " define the role of first lady for herself . "
Stock and others who know her say it 's too early to tell whether she 'll be more or less like any of her recent predecessors — activist or traditionalist , lightning rod or soother — or something completely different .
She is , after all , unprecedented : the first African - American first lady , the first one who is a descendant of slaves , the second - youngest since the 19th century , one of the best educated ( Princeton and Harvard ) , and the most career - oriented up to now ( as a lawyer , municipal official and hospital executive ) .
She and her husband remain not entirely familiar to most Americans , and some people may still be influenced by the rhetoric of campaign opponents who depicted her as an unpatriotic and angry black woman nursing racial grievances despite her successful life story .
Since the Nov. 4 election , the couple have undermined that caricature through widely viewed television interviews in which they demonstrated warmth , affection , humor — and normality .
" What you see is what you get , " says Marilyn Katz , a Chicago public - relations executive and friend of the Obamas .
" The more you know them , the more you love them , which is really not true about most politicians . "
In the process , many non-black Americans also will learn more that African - American families are much like their own , says retired federal judge and Chicago law professor Abner Mikva , an old friend of the Obamas .
" ( Some Americans ) have never really seen real - life African - American families except for the Hollywood Bill Cosby version , " Mikva says .
The Obamas are " going to be very much in the goldfish bowl , but it 's going to be interesting and exciting and educating for all of us . "
Details , details Meanwhile , Michelle , who turns 45 three days before the Jan. 20 inauguration , is preparing to move into the big white mansion built by slaves like her great - great - grandfather in South Carolina .
She is the topic of inquiring minds :
What will she wear ?
What will she serve ?
Will she redecorate ?
Where will the family worship ?
Will she entertain more at the White House ?
Pose for the cover of Vogue ?
What will be her first - lady project ?
Will she be managing some big - deal policy issue ?
As Washington pundits feverishly speculated about whether he would hire Hillary Clinton ( he did , as secretary of State ) , Washington hostesses have wondered whether she would hire a new chef .
( No word on that yet , but a note to the kitchen :
He likes chili and margaritas but hates beets , and the whole family loves Mexican . )
Advice and briefings are pouring in over the transition transom , from sources ranging from outgoing first lady Laura Bush to Barbara Walters to total strangers .
Here 's what you should do about the new puppy , Michelle .
Here 's what you should wear to the inauguration .
Here 's where the best closets are in the White House .
Here 's the best school for your daughters , here 's the most prestigious church for Sunday , and here 's how you can make new friends and thrill the social scene in the nation 's capital .
( Hint : Show up at parties every once in a while . )
All of this has seemed to have left the Obamas a little stunned , a little amused .
Laughing , they have told interviewers such as Walters that they have received more advice and comments about the puppy than about the Cabinet .
( For the record , the Obamas say they wo n't be selecting the new White House dog until the spring at the earliest , and it wo n't be a " yappy , " " girly " or sneeze - inducing dog .
A decision on where they 'll worship is pending .
And they 're sending the kids to Sidwell Friends , a highly regarded Quaker school in Washington that Chelsea Clinton , among other children of the rich and powerful , attended . )
Michelle has said she intends to be mostly " mom- in - chief " initially , making sure Malia , 10 , and Natasha ( Sasha ) , 7 , are settled and happy in their new home and new school .
" Politically , this is part of an ongoing effort to soften her image and present a more domesticated Michelle Obama , " says Liza Mundy , author of Michelle : A Biography , the first major book about the future first lady .
" So there is some spin there , even if she is a very committed parent .
And her daughters are at an age when they still need a lot from her . "
Beyond that , Michelle talked during the campaign about helping stressed military families , about volunteerism , and the difficulties of balancing work and family .
But not many specifics yet .
The newly appointed White House social secretary , Desirée Rogers , 49 , a Chicago corporate executive and close friend of the Obamas ( who will be the first - ever African - American social secretary ) , says one initial idea Michelle has mentioned is inviting military families to the White House for the inauguration .
" We want to create a White House that is really the people 's house , and with that , you gotta have the people there , " Rogers says .
" Especially family events .
We 've not had two young children in the White House for some time , so that allows us to do things that can be fun and lighthearted .
We want to make certain everyone feels included .
" Mundy says that comments from Rogers and the Obamas themselves have led to expectations that the Obamas will have a much closer relationship with Washington than their predecessors .
( George W. Bush , for example , had almost none . )
Barack Obama said recently on Meet the Press that he and Michelle have discussed opening up the White House to musicians , artists , scientists and poets , as the Kennedys did .
" I think that 's a pretty good indication that socializing and events in general are going to be a lot more ramped up in this administration , thanks in part to Michelle and her outgoing personality , " Mundy says .
Michelle is unlikely to head a major public - policy initiative in the style of Clinton , at least initially , says first - lady historian Myra Gutin , professor of communications at Rider University in Lawrenceville , N.J.
But a more vibrant social life is a strong possibility , and that is no small thing in assessing the success of any administration , Gutin says .
" There is a serious side to entertaining .
It can be used to accomplish political ends , " she says .
" ( Former first lady ) Lady Bird Johnson used invitations to the White House very strategically , and Michelle Obama , who is very savvy , might do the same thing .
And it might also be she likes a good party . "
In contrast to Barack Obama 's cool , professorial image , friends say Michelle is the kind of " girlfriendy " gal with whom you 'd like to share a glass of wine and a leisurely lunch .
" She often added spice to a candidate who seemed so disciplined , " Brazile says .
" While he was professorial , she would shake it up a bit .
She provided the emotion , the seasoning and the spices in that campaign . "
Her pals characterize Michelle as smart , passionate and irrepressible .
She 's highly organized , comfortable with authority and keenly aware that although her own family is prosperous , many of the families she grew up with in South Side Chicago are not .
She and her husband share a desire to do something about that , Mundy says in her biography .
" She 's a down - to - earth woman with consummate self - confidence and excellent judgment , complete integrity , and capable of keeping her kids grounded while being a helpmate and adviser to her husband , " says Barbara Engel , who knows the Obamas from the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago , where they live .
" I think Michelle is going to make history as first lady .
...
She will keep it real . "
' Secure in her own skin '
It 's not always easy to label first ladies .
Although Clinton was an activist and groundbreaking first lady , she also did all the traditional things first ladies do .
And Laura Bush , while keeping a relatively low profile for most of her husband 's tenure , became the administration 's leading critic of Myanmar 's military junta during the past year .
According to the Marist Poll , Americans are split on whether Michelle will improve the role of first lady , with 41 % of those polled saying she will and 41 % saying she will not alter the position in any way .
Barry Landau , presidential historian and author of The President 's Table : 200 Years of Dining & Diplomacy , says Michelle could turn out to be more traditional than many expect because she wo n't have to fight the same battles for respect as a power broker as , say , Clinton did .
" She impresses me as a woman who is very secure in her own skin , " he says .
" She is going to establish her own style , but she 's not going to create any waves .
Americans are going to be pleasantly surprised .
The campaign was about change , but I do n't think we 're going to see much change in the running of the White House . "

The month of December has already been unkind to Microsoft .
The software giant 's Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser saw significant market share drops reported on back - to - back days .
Not only was the November percentage drop for Windows the biggest in two years , but Windows market share dipped below a number where it has historically held tight : 90 percent .
According to Web metrics company , Net Applications , Windows market share as of Dec. 1 is 89.6 percent .
Meanwhile , Mac OS
X posted its largest gain in two years , with 8.9 percent market share at the end of November .
On the browser side , Internet Explorer 's market share dropped below 70 percent to 69.8 percent for the first time in more than a decade .
IE slid 1.5 percentage points in November , totaling a 5.8 percent market share loss for 2008 , according to Net Applications .
New challengers continue chasing IE , with the introduction of Google 's Chrome browser into the market .
And rival browsers Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari saw gains in November of 0.8 percent and 0.6 percent , respectively .
Industry experts say these market share decreases for Microsoft will likely continue , so the pressure is on the software giant to compete more effectively next year with the expected releases of and Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8 .
Mac OS Keeps Gaining on Windows
A note of caution : Though the data from the Net Applications report was reported by many media outlets , Rob Enderle , Principal Analyst of consulting firm the Enderle Group , does not put a lot of stock in the report .
" Since surveys like this typically have a confidence range of 3 percent , movements of a fraction of a percent are n't very meaningful . "
Nevertheless , Enderle emphasized that Mac OS X has been gaining steadily on Windows for the past two years because of Vista 's platform problems and Apple 's strong marketing .
Enderle also has seen that Macs are sneaking into the enterprise , as more buying decisions have recently moved away from IT to the line - of - business organizations that fund the upgrades .
These organizations are finding that Macs , despite their high premium price , actually provide a lower total cost for enterprises than PCs , Enderle says .
According to Enderle , overall cost in an Apple shop is less because the employees pick up much of the support burden themselves rather than relying on an overburdened IT department .
Often , the employees are even encouraged to buy their own Mac machines , dropping the annual cost below $ 1,000 per employee per year , he says .
Enderle notes that the average cost for a notebook computer in a large enterprise , including support , runs about $ 1,800 per year per employee , excluding only non-OS software licenses .
Vista Makes Some Progress
The Mac OS may be making incremental gains on Windows every day , but the Net Applications market share report showed that Vista is finally gaining on its predecessor , Windows XP .
In November , Vista grew its market share by 1.16 percentage points , cracking the 20 percent mark for the first time .
XP market share fell by 1.81 percent in November , according to Net Applications .
Roger Kay , president of research and consulting firm Endpoint Technologies , says that Vista 's market share bump proves the OS is at last winning over people 's trust .
" Vista is finally stable after two years , and more people are adopting it willingly , " he says .
" Commercial entities are aware that XP support is going away and are making their peace with Vista . "
Enderle , on the other hand , sees Vista 's gains as negligible , and believes that Windows XP will only be eclipsed by the next version of Windows .
" Windows 7 may help Microsoft recover , but Windows remains at risk until Windows 7 ships , " he says .
Will Windows 7 and IE8 Stop the Bleeding ?
Internet Explorer is feeling the heat of a more crowded marketplace , and is suffering from compatibility issues with IE7 that have driven users to Firefox , which grew to 20.8 percent market share in November .
On top of that , the browser was vulnerable in November to more weekend days and holidays and the increasing unemployment rate , analysts say .
" The more home users who are online using Firefox and Safari at home rather than IE , the more those browsers ' shares go up , " says Vince Vizzaccarro , Net Applications ' executive VP of marketing .
" You have to factor for the unemployment rate , too , " he added .
" That 's put a lot more users at home as well , which means more users using Firefox and Safari , not IE . "
Just as Enderle thinks the arrival of Windows 7 will come to the rescue on the OS side , he feels the same about IE8 on the browser side .
" IE8 , which is due early next year , addresses many of the issues in IE7 that have been driving folks to Firefox , " Enderle says .
" IE8 should slow the erosion there substantially if it meets expectations . "
Kay agrees that 2009 is a vitally important year for Microsoft and that the Windows 7 / IE8 package has the potential to save face .
" IE now faces more viable competitors than ever before , " he says .
" However , Microsoft may regain some ground with Windows 7 , which may drag IE along with it . "

CIA complicit on September 11 ?
http://tinyurl.com/3svz78
An interview with Michael Springman exposes the CIA 's links with the terrorist attacks on September 11 Dateline : Saturday , January 19 , 2002
Straight Goods reader Ken MacAllister of Vancouver , BC writes :
Michael Springmann worked for the US government for 20 years with the foreign service and consulate .
He just went public with the story of his involvement in a large scale CIA operation that brought hundreds of people from the middle east to the US , issued them passports and trained them to be terrorists .
Springmann says that the CIA is working closely with Bin Laden and his operatives in Jeddah and has been since 1987 .
The most haunting implication from this interview is that all of the terrorist acts of late were planned and paid for by the CIA with US taxpayers money so that the US could legitimately bomb the hell out of Afghanistan -- not to " get the Taliban " as the official party line states , but to erase all of the evidence of the US 's secret operations in Afghanistan left over from its 10 year war with the Soviet Union in that country .
Based on the new information from Mr. Springmann , it is likely that most of those 600 + people who were " rounded up " within days of the September 11 attacks were actually in the US because the CIA brought them there .
It lends credence to the idea that the CIA was also behind the anthrax letters and that is why there was weapons - grade anthrax and why the perpetrator will never be caught .
The interview is riveting , and I urge you to give it a listen .

' Extensive Reports ' Coming in to Problem Hotline of Machines in Philly ' Simply Not Working ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/4/2008 , 10:19 am PT
Minutes ago , on CNN , they reported that " mechanical problems " are their quickest growing category of problems coming in to their hotline .
" They had n't even registered on our ticker previously , " said the host .
Perhaps because the Obama / DNC campaigns did n't tell them about all of the problems they 've been finding ?
A press release issued from 866 - MYVOTE1 and CNN ... at 9:30 am PT reports on an alarming number of calls coming from " key states , like Pennsylvania , Virgian and Florida , " And yes , as predicted , problems in Philadelphia where " there are extensive reports of machines simply not working . "
A perfectly predictable issue , that this horrifying chief of Philly elections did n't seem to care about just days ago .
Details from the CNN / VoterAction.org press release follow ...
Today , the 1 - 866 - MY - VOTE - 1 and CNN hotlines have received a total of more than 16,000 calls ; close to 3,000 in the last hour .
Voter Action is concerned about several states , including VA , PA , and FL .
" Ensuring that voters have access to the ballot box in a timely manner , and that their votes are counted is our number one goal today , " said John Bonifaz , legal director , Voter Action .
" We are really concerned about the number and kinds of calls coming in from key states , like Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida . "
Virginia is reporting extensive machine malfunction , specifically with voting machine books , causing long lines of people standing in the rain .
The Voter Action legal team has contacted the Governor 's office .
Florida is reporting a wider variety of challenges , including registration issues where individuals do not appear to be registered ; machines at poll sites appear to not be functioning , or are insufficient ; and , optical scanners are breaking down , aggravating the already long lines .
The Voter Action legal team was unable to reach local officials by phone , but has faxed alerts to both local and state officials , including the Secretary of State .
Pennsylvania is primarily reporting mechanical problems , especially in Philadelphia where there are extensive reports of machines simply not working .
Voter Action is especially concerned about emergency paper ballots being improperly treated as provisional ballots .
In light of the recent federal court order , Voter Action is particularly concerned about Philadelphia County officials stating that emergency paper ballots will not be counted until Friday , which does not comply with the Secretary of State directive that these be treated as regular ballots to be counted on Election Day .
Says investigators should look at the the role of John Dugan , Comptroller of the Currency , in the sale of National City to PNC
Updated at 7 p.m .
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
What Ohio members of Congress had to say about the National City sale :
" Friday was a sad day for Cleveland .
Even though National City supported the rescue bill passed by Congress , management 's decision to invest in the risky subprime market , coupled with Bush administration deregulation , put the bank in such a weak position it could not qualify for funds .
If another bank had not purchased National City , I am afraid the job loss would have been even more severe . "
Sen. Sherrod Brown , Avon Democrat
" I have been warning for weeks that the congressionally approved bailout , which I vigorously opposed , would give the Treasury Department the power to pick winners and losers .
By helping PNC and denying help to National City , the Treasury Department has proven my point . "
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , Cleveland Democrat
" It is horrifying to me that [ the Treasury ] Department and Comptroller John Dugan now control the fate of banks throughout the nation , and that federal ' rescue ' money is being used to prop up some banks so they can purchase other banks that have been denied funding .
This decision will effectively kill a Civil War-era bank from Cleveland , costing thousands of jobs . "
Rep. Steven LaTourette , Bainbridge Township Republican
" The Treasury Department and Bush administration are doing something very nefarious with their buddies on Wall Street .
They are harming our good banks .
They are rewarding the wrongdoers . "
Rep. Marcy Kaptur , Toledo Democrat
" We are all very concerned about what is happening with National City .
The Treasury should not be able to wield its authority to benefit one bank at the expense of another and there should be an immediate investigation into whether this was the case with PNC and National City .
It is also critical that Congress remain vigilant in its oversight over the Treasury Department during every step of this process .
Most immediately , we must do all that we can to ensure that the jobs at National City are secure . "
Rep. Betty Sutton , Copley Township Democrat
" Obviously , the decision was made that they did n't meet the needs of the financial community in their present shape .
That was the reason for the takeover . "
Rep. Ralph Regula , Navarre Republican
WASHINGTON -- Rep. Steven LaTourette wants the Treasury Department and Congress to investigate whether Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan steered $ 7.7 billion of taxpayer bailout money to his former client PNC so it could buy National City Bank .
LaTourette noted that before being sworn in as the nation 's primary banking regulator in August 2005 , Dugan represented Pittsburgh - based PNC as an attorney in the Washington law firm Covington and Burling .
" I am very concerned that the comptroller first deprived bailout money to National City Bank and then orchestrated its sale to his former client PNC , " LaTourette said in a news statement .
" The officials at PNC have made it very clear that they were only able to buy National City because they got a $ 7.7 billion handout from the federal government . "
A Treasury Department spokeswoman did not respond on Monday to requests for comment on Dugan 's ties to PNC , or to LaTourette 's request for an investigation .
LaTourette , a Bainbridge Township Republican , and other Ohio members of Congress who opposed the $ 700 billion financial industry bailout package that Congress approved earlier this month are raising questions about the use of tax dollars for PNC 's fire - sale purchase of National City .
Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur , who represents half of Lorain County , described the move as " nefarious , " and says she believes that the Bush administration is using the bailout program to " concentrate banking power with their friends on Wall Street " and create cartels .
" By Washington and Wall Street cooperating to drive down the book value on banks across this country at the same time as they use taxpayer money to subsidize the wrongdoers , they are concentrating our financial system to an unheard - of level and destroying good banks in the process , " said Kaptur .
Cleveland Democrat Dennis Kucinich also called for Congress to investigate the deal , noting the sale " is being consummated under duress , and it was precipitated and facilitated by a collusion of forces and entities that must be investigated , exposed , and if appropriate , prosecuted . "
Rep. Betty Sutton , a Copley Township Democrat who supported the bailout , said she was " very concerned " about the National City bank deal , and called for congressional oversight of the Treasury Department as it oversees the bailout .
" Treasury should not be able to wield its authority to benefit one bank at the expense of another , and there should be an immediate investigation into whether this was the case with PNC and National City , " Sutton said .
LaTourette , a member of the House Financial Services Committee , wrote letters on Monday to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank requesting probes of the situation .
Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat , said he spoke with LaTourette on Monday and agreed to familiarize himself with the matter .
Frank plans an oversight hearing in November on the financial rescue plan , " and this could clearly be a part of it , " he said .
" This was not what we had in mind when we passed the rescue plan , " Frank said when asked about Treasury picking winners and losers .
" I 'm going to look into it . "
LaTourette said the Treasury Department money that went to PNC marked the first time the federal government took an equity stake in a regional bank .
According to LaTourette , about a week before National City was forced to sell itself to PNC , Dugan told National City Chief Executive Peter Raskind that his institution should n't expect federal bailout money .
LaTourette cited reports in the Wall Street Journal that claimed Dugan was " heavily involved " in the sale of National City to PNC .
LaTourette also observed that Paulson and Dugan gave PNC more bailout money than it was eligible to receive under the terms of the federal program .
He said the bailout law stipulated that the Treasury Department could only give a bank money equivalent to 3 percent of its risk - weighted assets , while PNC got an amount closer to 6 percent .
" This was supposed to be a $ 700 billion rescue package , and instead it 's being used to kill a Cleveland bank and kill local jobs , " LaTourette said .
" Some may argue that National City was already gravely ill , but make no mistake , Paulson and Dugan put the nail in the coffin . "
The complaint from LaTourette could carry weight because unlike Democratic congressional leaders , he is a Republican raising an issue about a Republican administration 's stewardship of the bailout .
In 2005 , LaTourette successfully got the federal government to reverse another decision that could have harmed Northeast Ohio after he demonstrated that the Pentagon overstated the cost of keeping payroll clerks and accountants at a Cleveland center .
Rather than shut down the center as initially proposed , the Pentagon wound up expanding the Defense Finance and Accounting Service operation in Cleveland .
At least two other Ohio members of Congress who backed the bailout said National City 's fate was unfortunate but unavoidable given the bank 's subprime mortgage losses .
Efforts to reach Rep. John Boehner of Southwest Ohio , the Republican House leader , were unsuccessful .

" Scientists have developed many ways to make individual nano - objects , but not many ways to securely join them together , " said Inkson .
" Most everyday joining techniques cannot be applied at the nanoscale , where nano - objects , a thousand times smaller than a human hair are easily destroyed by heat . "

By laying a nanowire across the objects that she wants to weld , and then passing just the right pulse of electricity through it , Inkson can connect the minuscule objects .

Defense expert says deadly crash was unavoidable ( Judge Shelton - Houston )
Posted on by trumandogz
A judge 's daughter accused of intoxication manslaughter could not have avoided the collision that killed her boyfriend because a truck driver had drifted into her lane , an accident reconstruction expert told a jury Friday .
Jurors also saw the defendant 's father , District Court Judge Pat Shelton , accuse prosecutors of selectively punishing his daughter , saying they failed to charge the truck driver for not immediately stopping after the wreck .
He then accused a witness who testified against his daughter of being an illegal immigrant .
The jury must decide whether Elizabeth Shelton , a 20 - year - old University of St. Thomas student , is responsible for the death of her passenger , Matthew McNiece , 19 , of Bellaire , as a result of the freeway crash last year .
Shelton 's blood - alcohol concentration was more than three times the legal limit  at 0.26 and 0.28 percent , based on two different blood tests  after the wreck .
Mother testifies
Her mother , Julia Shelton , told the jury Friday that police treated Elizabeth Shelton inhumanely , hauling her out of a hospital hours after the accident in handcuffs and a paper gown to take her to jail .
Accident reconstruction expert Joe Hinton , testifying for the defense , said Shelton had no chance to avoid the collision because the box truck , traveling next to her , veered a couple feet into her lane as she drove along the freeway 's far left side next to a wall .
The crash " could have happened to anyone in this room exactly the same way , " Hinton testified Friday , adding that a sober person also would have had no time to react .
" Intoxication makes no difference . "
Lance Bennett , the truck driver , has denied changing lanes before Shelton struck the rear of his vehicle .
Hinton 's conclusions also contradict those of another expert who testified there was no evidence that the truck pulled into Elizabeth Shelton 's lane .
Harris County sheriff 's deputy David Pearson , who also reviewed HPD 's work in the case , said no evidence shows the truck was in Shelton 's lane , adding if a motorist " was driving at the speed limit and was not intoxicated , the crash would never have occurred . "
Evidence problems
Both experts , nevertheless , agreed HPD 's investigation was flawed .
" It could have been a lot better , " Pearson said of HPD 's work .
" There was a lot of evidence that was n't documented properly . "
HPD 's lead investigator on the case , officer Sherwin Johnson , incorrectly had Shelton 's car towed to a private storage lot instead of the secured police compound after the wreck  a move that did not follow correct procedures .
Prosecutors had hoped to examine the crash data recorder , or " black box , " in Shelton 's car to retrieve information , such as her speed and braking at the time of impact , but attorney Mark T. Sandoval , representing Shelton 's mother in a lawsuit against the truck driver , went to the storage lot and removed the box before investigators executed a search warrant .
Sandoval later gave the black box to prosecutors , but Lexus officials refused to analyze the data inside .
Heated exchange
In a brief , but volatile , courtroom exchange with prosecutors Friday , Shelton 's father said he firmly believes the truck driver caused the wreck and argued prosecutors gave Bennett a pass when he failed to stop after the collision .
Bennett returned to the crash site minutes later and cooperated with police .
" He could 've been charged for failing to remain at the scene .
You could 've prosecuted both ( drivers ) , and you did not do that , " Pat Shelton said .
He said he was also told the truck driver had an arrest warrant for a hot check and was driving with lapsed automotive insurance , claims that visibly irritated prosecutor Paul Doyle .
" How in the world as a judge can you look at this jury and attack Mr. Bennett , who 's out there doing his job ? "
Doyle retorted .
Shelton 's father then claimed a witness to the crash who testified against his daughter was an illegal immigrant .
Doyle appeared incredulous .
" The same man who stopped to aid your daughter , to do the right thing , you 're attacking his citizenship status ?
Are you kidding me ? "
Doyle shouted .
" No one is above the law , " Shelton 's father responded .
' Extremely unprofessional '
Elizabeth Shelton 's mother told the jury she was appalled at the way police treated her daughter .
Julia Shelton described how police led her daughter out of a hospital hours after the crash , with her hands cuffed behind her back , wearing a paper hospital gown , barefoot and without underwear .
" The policemen were extremely ugly .
I could n't understand what this big rush was to get her off to jail , " she said .
" It was all the police officers I encountered that evening  they all copped an attitude , big time .
There was chuckling .
It was extremely unprofessional behavior .
I was appalled . "
Doyle asked if she thought it was appalling for someone to drive with a blood - alcohol concentration of 0.26 percent .
" I think it 's irresponsible , " she said .

This story , reported in a Houston paper shortly after the accident in October 2006 , paints quite a different picture : _____________
It is alleged Shelton and a friend , Mathew McNiece , were in an SUV and speeding while traveling south on the Southwest Freeway early Monday morning .
Witnesses said Shelton was behind the wheel when she lost control of her vehicle , swerved across two lanes of traffic and then hit a commercial Ford F - 650 truck .
Shelton was transported to Ben Taub General Hospital and became irate when told to submit a mandatory blood sample , according to the prosecutor .
" There was a lot of vulgarity and profanity used when they did ask for the blood sample ,  said prosecutor Paul Doyle .
 I think that is consistent with signs of intoxication .
As for Sheltons blood alcohol limit , Doyle said it was , .28 extremely high .
It s three times the legal limit in Texas which is .08 .
 If that is true , it is high the alcohol content ,  said defense attorney Bob Moen .
He said besides the obvious physical suffering , Shelton is hurting more inside .
 Shes seeing a grief counselor and that will continue for a period of time ,  said Moen .
____________ AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ... nope , ca n't dredge up a scintilla of pity .
Fry her .
While we 're at it , fry mommy ( whose attorney removed the " black box " ) and daddy , too ; this would be a better world without this whole family .

I know , I posted that story on FR .
Their testimony in court just shows what jerks the Sheldon family are .
I hope they toss the girl in prison for 20 years and that the Judge gets his a $$ kicked out of office .
He is an embarrassment to the GOP .

but attorney Mark T. Sandoval , representing Shelton 's mother in a lawsuit against the truck driver , went to the storage lot and removed the box before investigators executed a search warrant .
And he is still practicing , ???
Do n't know about somethings in texas ?

I believe the Judges ’ primary complaint is that the American Caste system does n’t seem to be working in Texas .
It makes me puke that certain people in certain professions and with certain income levels consider themselves and in many instances are treated by society as more worthy than the average American .
The two men who were killed in the Philadelphia ATM hiest were retired police officers .
Why do I know that would I have known about their former employment if they had been custodians or carpenters ?

Seems like real typical .
Daughter probably did all sorts of stuff before this and judge got her out of it .
Swerving accross two lanes of traffic speeding and very drunk and hitting a truck killing someone probably is too big to cover up .
So judge is suing trucking company for hitting truck .
Article of OP partially covers up facts .
Judge would have been smarter using his influence to get a favorable plea bargin , and done less damage to his own reputation that way .

Wonderful stuff .
Blagojevich Says He Thought of Oprah for Senate Oprah Winfrey says she could be a senator , but is n't interested .
Jan. 26 , 2009  -- Illinois ' beleaguered Gov. Rod Blagojevich said today that when he was deciding who would take President Obama 's Senate seat he considered appointing talk show queen Oprah Winfrey , a suggestion that Winfrey says left her " amused . "
Blagojevich made the revelation to Diane Sawyer on " Good Morning America " on the day his impeachment trial began .
That trial is expected to toss him out of office .
The governor said that Winfrey 's name came up as a potential successor to Obama in the Senate .
Watch Gov. Blagojevich's Interview With ABC News ' Cynthia McFadden On " Nightline " Tonight at 11:35 p.m. ET
" She seemed to be someone who had helped Barack Obama in a significant way to become president , " Blagojevich said .
Blagojevich added that " she had a much broader bully pulpit than a lot of senators . "
His consideration of Winfrey was tempered , he suggested , by the fact that " she probably would n't take it , and then if you offered it to her , how would you do it in a way it was n't a gimmick to embarrass her . "
Later on ABC's " The View , " he added that Winfrey was appealing because she was " an African - American woman who probably by herself has more influence than 100 senators . "
One of his hesitations , he said , was " Would she take the call of the governor of Illinois because Oprah is Oprah and I 'm only the governor of Illinois . "
Blagojevich said his consideration of Winfrey was " interrupted on Dec. 9 , " the day he was arrested by the FBI .
Winfrey , who endorsed Obama 's presidential bid and showcased his candidacy on her show , said she missed " GMA " this morning because she slept late .
" If I had been watching from the treadmill where I 'm usually watching , I would have fallen off the treadmill , " Winfrey told her friend Gayle King during the Sirius XM radio show " Oprah and Friends . "
Winfrey said she was " pretty amused " by Blagojevich 's revelation .
" I think I could be a senator , but I 'm not interested , " Winfrey said .
Blagojevich 's appearance on " GMA " was part of the governor 's media blitz on the day that his impeachment trial began in Springfield , Ill . -- without him .
Blagojevich has already conceded that he will probably be convicted of corruption charges , but is refusing to resign or to attend the trial to defend himself .
Instead , he was scheduled to appear on ABC's " GMA , " " The View , " and " Nightline , " NBC 's the " Today " show , and CNN's " Larry King Live . "
The governor insisted he was innocent but was boycotting his trial because he was not allowed to introduce witnesses like Obama 's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and the president 's top adviser Valerie Jarrett .
" I 'm talking to Americans to let them know what 's happening in the land of Lincoln , " Blagojevich said .
In his opening statement before the Senate , David Ellis , the lawyer for the Illinois House of Representatives bringing the charges , said the goal of the impeachment is to protect citizens from someone who has " repeatedly and utterly abused the powers of his office . "
When asked whether he had tried to auction off Obama 's Senate seat , Blagojevich said , " Absolutely not and I 'll have a chance in a criminal case to show my innocence and bring witnesses . "
Blagojevich on Impeachment Trial
In an interview , " Nightline 's " Cynthia McFadden challenged the governor over his contention that he was boycotting the trial because he is not allowed to call witnesses .
" We talked to a whole range of Constitutional lawyers , none of whom believe that the process in the senate today is un-Constitutional , that in fact all of the rights that apply ... in criminal court do n't apply in the impeachment process .
You 're a lawyer , you know that 's true , do n't you ? " asked McFadden .
Blagojevich , however , insisted that the Constitution gave him the right in any trial setting to confront his accusers and call witnesses .
" Anytime in America when someone is accused of wrongdoing , everyone should have a right to be able to show he did n't do anything wrong .
And being able to show you did n't do anything wrong , part of it is to be able to present evidence and bring witnesses in to say that there was nothing wrong , " he said .
He lost one the voice of one supporter today .
His wife was scheduled to appear with him on " The View , " but show host Barbara Walters announced that Patricia Blagojevich canceled " on the advice of her family . "
Blagojevich and his father - in - law , Chicago Alerman Richard Mell , have been feuding publicly since 2005 when the governor closed a dump owned by a Mell relative .
Addressing both the television audience and Blagojevich , Walters said , " Her father is an alderman and is quoted as saying that ' you use everybody and when there is no more use you discard them . '
Your wife 's family does n't seem to be crazy about you . "
" My wife would have loved to be here .
She 's a big fan of your program , " Blagojevich replied .
Reminded that many people , including Obama , have called on him to resign and that Mayor Richard Daley even called him " cuckoo , " the governor said , " Here 's a question I have to you , to Mayor Daley and everyone else : Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence ? "
" The fix is in , " Blagojevich told " GMA . "
" They want me out of the way " so the Illinois legislature can enact a large tax increase , he said .
Illinois state Sen. Matt Murphy scoffed at the governor 's argument .
" First let 's work through all that red herring he just served us all for breakfast , " Murphy told " GMA . "
He called Blagojevich 's argument that the trial was unfair the " most self - serving ludicrous statement I 've ever heard in my life . "
A conviction would make Blagojevich the first governor in Illinois history to be removed from office .
Blagojevich Defends Wife
During his " GMA " appearance , Blagojevich also defended his wife , who has been compared to Lady McBeth after surveillance tapes reportedly caught her encouraging her husband 's allegedly illegal activities .
" My wife is a loving wife who cares for our children .
She 's the best person I know , a person of great character and integrity , " Blagojevich said .
He said he tells his children , Amy , 10 , and Annie , 4 , " the most important part is they should know their father is not the person they 're trying to say he is . "
The governor has been waging a bizarre defense since his arrest by FBI agents on Dec. 9 .
He has complained that the trial is rigged and compared himself to a cowboy being lynched , as well as to such martyrs to justice as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Ghandi .
The most spectacular of the accusations against Blagojevich is that he tried to sell the Senate seat vacated by Obama to the highest bidder .
In a remarkable demonstration of his political shrewdness , Blagojevich forced the U.S. Senate to accept his appointment of Roland Burris to that seat after the Senate 's leaders said they would never accept anyone named by the tainted governor .
OK here are my main list of faults with your KDE 3.5 for 8.10 fix -
The taskbar and panel over lap in corners ( i have one down the right side and one along the bottom , VERY annoying ) -
Like the taskbars , desktop icons refuse to see the panel too so they go under it , again annoying . -
Networking is FUBAR , i had to manually override the config even with your suggestion above .- sound is DEAD - WiFi is DEAD -
System performance is now very very low , even after I disabled all fancy effects mem usage for Xorg is just under 1 gig !!!!!
This may just be the new version but stupid memory requirements seem very very vista'ishSorry no specific errors since they all just ' dont work ' and as much as I would like to route around and fix them I have a major web site launch this weekend and really did not need this mamoth waste of time .
KDE & Kubuntu devs have really sold out the hard working power user with this update .
I am really sad .

BNP members have told BBC News they have received threatening and abusive phone calls and e-mails after a leaked document was published online .
The membership list includes police officers , who are banned from being in the BNP , teachers and soldiers .
It includes names , addresses , telephone numbers and jobs of 12,000 people .
It has been removed from the blog it was published on after protests by BNP leaders but members say they are still receiving threatening messages .
' Very careful '
One woman , who did not want to be named , told BBC Radio 5 Live she had received a late - night phone saying she should be " very careful " as someone could come to her house .
The BNP 's regional organiser in Northern Ireland has advised members to increase their personal security because of the risk of attack from dissident Republicans .
John , from Redcar , told BBC Radio 5
Live he had been inundated with abusive and threatening e-mails since the list was published .
WHO CAN JOIN THE BNP ?
Police and prison officers : Banned Council and NHS employees :
Not banned but would be disciplined if beliefs interfered with job Doctors :
Must not allow beliefs to compromise care or attempt to impose political views on patients Nurses :
Not forbidden but code of conduct requires commitment to equality and diversity Teachers : Membership of political parties must not compromise professional conduct Union members :
Under new laws BNP members could be expelled if judged to be incompatible with the union 's beliefs Armed forces personnel :
Not explicitly banned but personnel are barred from political activity or demonstration
Analysis : BNP privacy issues " They have said they will put them [ his details ] on as many sites as they can and they wo n't leave us alone , " he said .
But Richard , a Blackpool hotelier , said : " We did have some strange phone calls last night but if you are a member of any party you should not be ashamed of it . "
BNP spokesman Simon Darby said it had contacted a company involved with the blog to warn of the consequences if it was not taken down .
Party leader Nick Griffin called the leak " a disgraceful act of treachery " by former members .
He claimed the threatening calls were part of an " established dirty tricks campaign " from the Labour Party .
Mr Griffin said he had lodged a complaint with Dyfed - Powys Police on the grounds that the publication breached human rights and data protection laws .
He told the BBC the party would use Human Rights
Act to try to protect the identities of its members .
He said he had " no problem at all " about the professions of members being in the public domain , as " a matter of public interest " , but called publishing people 's names and addresses a " nasty piece of intimidation " .
' Ashamed ' Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said everyone had the " right to protection under data protection laws " but it was up to Dyfed - Powys Police whether to take the matter further .
Occupations ascribed to the names on the list include teachers , a doctor , nurse and members of the armed forces .

While there is no ban on many of those professions joining the BNP , its anti-immigration policies are seen by some organisations as incompatible with frontline public service .
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman confirmed that Paul Murray , a member of the Royal staff , was on the list .
She said the 41 - year - old storeman , and his wife Jennifer , 44 , both denied being BNP members .
Mr Murray , who works at Windsor Castle , believes their names may have appeared on the list because they were once invited to a BNP social event which they did not attend .
' Incompatible '
The denial was accepted and no further action is to be taken .
The membership list , from 2007 , also includes the name of one man alleged to be a vicar and another said to be a prison officer .
A Prison Service spokesman said membership of the BNP was " entirely incompatible with working in the Prison Service and , if it is confirmed that a member of staff belongs to one of them , they will be subject to our disciplinary procedures " .
Police officers are also banned from joining , a policy which is recognised in the list .
Alongside the name of a serving officer , the document states that there is " Discretion required re. employment concerns " .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it was content for Merseyside Police to handle a complaint about one of its officers allegedly being a BNP member .
Injunction
The party said the publication could lead to identity theft and endanger children named in the list .
Some as young as 14 are included where their families have party memberships .
Earlier this year , the BNP obtained an injunction at the High Court in Manchester banning any publication of the list .
Mr Griffin said the list was " essentially genuine " , but a number of names of people who were not or are not party members had been added .
North Wales
Police said they would tackle any reports of an information breach " in the usual robust manner " .
The Information Commission will contact the BNP for the full facts of the case before deciding whether any action will be taken , a spokesman said .

To understand how angry and disappointed many Democrats are that Barack Obama has invited evangelical preacher Rick Warren to give the invocation at his inaugural , imagine if a President - elect John McCain had offered this unique honor to the Rev. Al Sharpton -- or the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. I know , it ’s hard to picture : John McCain would never do that in a million years .
Republicans respect their base even when , as in McCain ’s case , it does n’t really return the favor .
Only Democrats , it seems , reward their most loyal supporters -- feminists , gays , liberals , opponents of the war , members of the reality - based community -- by elbowing them aside to embrace their opponents instead .
Most Americans who ’ve heard of Warren know him as the teddy - bearish , Hawaiian - shirted head of the Saddleback megachurch in Orange County and the author of “ The Purpose Driven Life . ”
Perhaps they also know he ’s the rare right - wing Christian pastor who sometimes talks about poverty and global warming and HIV .
His concern for those issues has given him a reputation as a moderate and has made him the darling of Democratic Party think tanks , ever hoping to break the Republican lock on the white evangelical vote .
But on the signal issues of the religious right he is , as he himself has said , as orthodox as James Dobson .
And as inflammatory .
Warren does n’t just oppose gay marriage , he ’s compared it to incest and pedophilia .
He does n’t just want to ban abortion , he ’s compared women who terminate pregnancies to Nazis and the pro-choice position to Holocaust denial .
( Hmmm ...
If a fertilized egg is as precious as a born Jewish human being , does that mean a born Jewish human being is only as valuable as a fertilized egg ? )
Speaking of Jews , Warren has publicly stated his belief that they will burn in hell , presumably along with everyone else who has n’t accepted his particular brand of Christianity ( i.e. , the vast majority of people in the world ) .
And forget about evolution -- the existence of homosexuals , he ’s argued , disproves Darwin .
And while we may not know how old the Earth is , the Saddleback website assures us that dinosaurs and humans coexisted .
Warren claims that his views are mainstream , pointing out that in 30 states , the majority of voters have banned gay marriage .
Popular does n’t mean right , of course , but regardless of what Americans think about gay marriage , on other so - called social issues , he ’s way out in far - right field .
Take abortion .
Most Americans , whatever their personal feelings , are pro-choice .
On election day , anti-choice initiatives went down to defeat in all three states where they were on the ballot .
Most Americans do not think the one - third of American women who terminate a pregnancy are running a concentration camp in their wombs , and would have no trouble choosing between saving a Jew from a gas chamber and a fertilized egg from a fire at the clinic .
Or take marriage .
At his Saddleback Church , wifely submission is official doctrine :
The church website tells women to defer to their husband ’s “ leadership ” even when he ’s wrong on important issues , such as finances .
Never mind if she ’s an accountant and he flunked long division , or if she wants to beef up the kids ’ college fund and he wants to buy shares in the Brooklyn Bridge .
The godly answer is supposed to be “ yes , dear . ”
Is elevating this male chauvinist how President - elect Obama thanks women , who gave him more than half his votes ?
Or take foreign policy .
In electing Obama , Americans overwhelmingly rejected President Bush ’s Wild West approach to foreign policy .
Apparently Warren did n’t get that memo either .
Unlike many evangelical preachers , he issued a statement against torture , but despite his access to Bush , he told Beliefnet.com that he never raised the subject of torture with him .
( “ I just did n’t have the opportunity , ” he said -- although he apparently found plenty of time to lecture Obama about abortion . )
On “ Hannity & Colmes , ” he agreed that the president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , should be killed because “ the Bible says God puts government on Earth to punish evildoers . ”
Really ?
The Bible says the United States should murder the leaders of other sovereign states ?
How many other heads of state does Warren want to do away with ?
If Ahmadinejad , who is , after all , a more - or - less democratically elected leader , had shared his inauguration with an imam who had called on national television for the assassination of President Bush , Americans would be calling for the nuking of Tehran .
In a news conference Thursday , Obama defended the choice of Warren : “ It is important for the country to come together even though we may have disagreements on certain social issues . ”
That ’s all very well , but excuse me if I do n’t feel all warm and fuzzy .
Obama won thanks to the strenuous efforts of people who ’ve spent the last eight years appalled by the Bush administration ’s wars and violations of human rights , its attacks on gays and women , its denigration of science , its general pandering to bigotry and ignorance in the name of God .
I ’m all for building bridges , but honoring Warren , who insults Obama ’s base as perverts and murderers , is definitely a bridge too far .
Katha Pollitt , a poet , essayist and critic , writes the “ Subject to Debate ” column in the Nation .
She is the author , most recently , of “ Learning to Drive : And Other Life Stories . ”
When news broke that Timothy Geithner was Barack Obama ’s pick for Secretary of the Treasury , the stock market jumped more than six per cent in the space of an hour .
Obviously , this was a good thing , but there was also something weird about the spectacle of the Street ’s once fearless free marketeers exulting over a government appointment , as if they were nomenklatura members cheering a new Politburo chief .
It showed just how central a few government officials have become to the well - being not just of the markets but of the economy as a whole .
For better or worse , we now live in a world in which the Treasury Secretary controls hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and shapes the fate of some of the nation ’s biggest companies .
That ’s quite a job to ask someone to do .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
If anyone is up to the task , Geithner seems to be .
A decade ago , as a Treasury under - secretary , he helped orchestrate the successful response to the Asian financial meltdown .
As head of the New York Federal Reserve , he was prescient about systemic risks to the financial system .
And , during the current crisis , he ’s the third member of the fire brigade led by the outgoing Treasury Secretary , Henry Paulson , and the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke .
Geithner will be well partnered : Christina Romer , who will be running the Council of Economic Advisers , is an expert on the Great Depression , and Larry Summers , who is both a superlative academic economist and a former Treasury Secretary , will be running the National Economic Council .
It ’s not surprising that Obama ’s economic team is already drawing comparisons to the New York Yankees .
( Let ’s hope they ’re the 1927 Yankees , rather than the more recent edition . )
Still , no Treasury Secretary has ever entered office with as much responsibility as Geithner will have .
That ’s partly because the crisis is so huge , but it ’s also the result of an evolution in the role that we expect government to play in the economy .
For much of American history , Treasury Secretaries were nondescript , and their powers circumscribed .
When the Panic of 1907 nearly froze financial markets , it was to J. P. Morgan , not Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou , that investors turned for a solution .
Our contemporary preference for government rescues has its roots in the Great Depression , when Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon became notorious for his contention that , even as the economy was collapsing , the market should simply be allowed to do its work .
“ Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , liquidate real estate , ” he coldly advised .
The perceived failure of this approach discredited non-intervention , and ended up enhancing the influence of Mellon ’s successors .
In recent years , as the frequency and the severity of financial crises have increased , so , too , has the prominence of the Treasury Secretary ’s role .
During the Clinton Administration , Robert Rubin engineered a backdoor bailout of the Mexican economy , before helping to manage the global financial crisis of the late nineties .
Paulson seems to unveil a new government program nearly every day , and his actions over the past year have meant life or death for financial institutions .
The problem is that for this kind of power to be effective in a crisis , the markets need to be confident that the government has a coherent strategy in place .
And while Paulson has certainly acted aggressively in the past two months , at times it has seemed as if the Treasury were making things up as it went along .
Initially , Paulson rejected the idea of using some of the bailout money to recapitalize banks , planning instead to buy toxic assets and get them off bank balance sheets .
Then he announced that he would recapitalize banks and , a month later , that there would be no toxic - asset purchases after all .
And last week he unveiled a plan to backstop consumer debt .
On their own , each of these moves may have made sense .
But the zigzags left the markets discombobulated and uncertain .
There ’s no doubt that , in dealing with the crisis , Paulson has done a yeoman ’s job .
But in some respects he ’s just been in the wrong place at the wrong time .
When he became Treasury Secretary , in 2006 , he had more of a reputation as a dealmaker than as a strategic thinker .
He was leery of regulation — at his nomination hearing , he warned of the perils of “ creeping regulatory expansion ” — and seemed skeptical of government interference with markets .
This background may have made Paulson the right man to deal with what then seemed like the Bush Administration ’s biggest priorities , things like tax policy and China .
But it perhaps was n’t the best preparation for orchestrating the largest government intervention in American history .
By contrast , Wall Street seems to see in Geithner someone who , with his experience fighting financial crises and regulating markets , has been effectively training for his new job for more than a decade .
Furthermore , Geithner combines a sense of continuity with the prospect of decisive change .
He ’s an advocate of free markets , but he has also called for tighter regulation .
As a Rubin disciple , he believes in fiscal responsibility , but he also supports a major stimulus package .
And while he was part of the team that watched Lehman Brothers fail , he seems more comfortable with government action than Paulson , and therefore more likely to act in a consistent fashion .
In times of crisis , after all , it is n’t just what the government does that matters — it ’s also the way the government does it .
Geithner projects a conviction that acting to arrest financial meltdown is not just necessary but right .
In these times , that ’s something the market is surprisingly happy to hold on to . ♦

As goes the economy , so goes McCain — down :
From Arjun Modi
From Steve Lombardo in Pollster.com :
The past 14 days have transformed this election .
The financial crisis has catapulted Obama into the lead both nationally and in key states .
We have been saying for six months that the political environment has favored the Democrats significantly , but it took a near global financial meltdown for things to finally reach the tipping point .
The economic situation has virtually ended John McCain ’s presidential aspirations and no amount of tactical maneuvering in the final 29 days is likely to change that equation .

Advertisement Riots have broken out in several Greek cities after police shot dead a teenager in the capital Athens .
The unrest began soon after the shooting in the central Exarchia district , a regular scene of clashes between police and leftist groups .
Youths threw petrol bombs , burned cars and smashed shop windows .
Riots then spread to Thessaloniki , Greece 's second largest city , to the northern cities of Komotini and Ioannina , and to Crete .
Two officers have been suspended , and an inquiry is under way , after the worst such violence in several years .
Protesters screamed slogans , attacking police cars with rocks

The BBC's Malcolm Brabant , in Athens , says that the rioters have set fire to banks and stores in the city 's main shopping district .
A four - storey building has also been torched and many cars destroyed .
Police lured Greece 's anarchists regard the quarter of Exarchia as their fortress and they frequently lure police into ambushes so they can attack them with rocks and fire bombs , our correspondent says .
As dawn broke over the city , emergency crews were damping down fires while many of the youths were understood to have retreated to Athens Polytechnic .
There are no reports of casualties among the police or rioters .
In a statement , interior minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos expressed the government 's " profound regret " for the shooting of the boy , reported to be 16 - years old .
" An inquiry on the circumstances of the death has already begun and , if the policemen are found to have been derelict in their duty , the punishment will be exemplary . "
In Athens , police fired tear gas at hundreds of stone - throwing youths , who went on a rampage as news of the shooting spread .
After a lull of a couple of hours , rioting resumed shortly after midnight local time ( 2200 GMT ) , with some protesters marching through Athens city centre and others fighting police outside the National Technical University of Athens , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Although damage was widespread , there were no reports of looting .
Witnesses said that the destruction was not indiscriminate .
While clothing shops and banks were badly damaged , the numerous snack bars were all left intact .
Vassilis Papadopoulos , who owns a shop that was badly damaged in the rioting , said the timing was particularly bad .
" It happened just before Christmas , we made an effort to decorate it , now the staff will come and see this , " he said .
Many cars have been destroyed in the Athens riots " Where will they get their Christmas bonus and Christmas gift from now ?
Its completely damaged , its tragic . "
In Thessaloniki dozens of youths attacked a police precinct , while others blocked a road near the university campus .
People were being encouraged to join in the protests via some websites , AP said .
An Interior Ministry press officer told Reuters news agency that Mr Pavlopoulos had offered his resignation to Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis , but it had been rejected .
Police issued a statement after the shooting , saying a patrol car with two officers inside was attacked by about 30 youths throwing stones .
They were attacked again and responded , with one firing a stun grenade and the other shooting and fatally wounding the boy , AP quoted the statement as saying .
Correspondents say the shooting and rioting are certain to ramp up clashes between anarchists and police .
A similar shooting in 1985 led to years of violence .
Residents have recently protested over rising crime and lawlessness , and complain that the police fail to answer emergency calls , staying barricaded in their police stations , our correspondent adds .
There were clashes between students and police in Athens last week when about 4,000 people attended a rally to oppose education reforms .
Police made 12 arrests after a group of violent protesters broke away and damaged banks and shop fronts .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : typehash version 1.3
The typehash library allows you to produce a unique identifier ( a cryptographic hash ) for a type .
This is useful if you save values of some type to a file ( text , binary , whatever format you wish ) and then when you read it back in again you want to verify that the type you want to read is the one you actually wrote .
The type hash takes into account both the actual name of the type and the structure of the type .
The type hash is a compact value that only allows comparing for equality .
The library also supports type codes .
A type code encodes the complete structure of a type and can be used for finer comparison than just equality , e.g. , will the read function be able to read what show produced ( in this case renaming types and adding constructors is allowed ) .
The library is on hackage , of course .

DALLAS – A jury convicted five former officials at the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) on all counts in the Hamas - support case after 8 days of deliberations .
The men , Shukri Abu-Baker , Ghassan Elashi , Mohamed El - Mezain , Mufid Abdulqader and Abdelrahman Odeh , could face up to 20 years in prison for their convictions on conspiracy counts , including conspiring to provide material support to terrorists .
The verdicts , read Monday afternoon , ended a two - year saga in what is considered the largest terror financing case since the 9/11 attacks .
In the original trial last year , jurors acquitted El - Mezain on 31 of the 32 counts against him , but could not reach unanimous verdicts on any other counts , prompting a mistrial .
Prosecutors made a series of significant adjustments , from dropping 29 counts each against defendants Mufid Abdulqader and Abdelrahman Odeh , to adding new witnesses who could put the charity support in context .
In addition , jurors in this trial saw three exhibits Israeli military officials seized from the Palestinian Authority which showed the PA also considered HLF to be a Hamas financer and that an HLF - supported charity committee was controlled by Hamas .
The result was a much more streamlined case that followed a logical narrative , said Peter Margulies , a law professor at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island .
Seeing the Palestinian Authority reach the same conclusion as the U.S. government had to have helped , he said .
In addition , prosecutors provided summary exhibits that served as " a road map " to the case and had to help jurors deliberate , Margulies said .
" The jury was able to look at the evidence and get past the perceived biases of any of the witnesses and see the evidence as a whole . "
That evidence made clear that the defendants knew where the money raised in the U.S. was going despite legal prohibitions against support for Hamas .
The verdict was hailed by M. Zuhdi Jasser , founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy .
Prosecutors prevailed because they were able to " connect the ideology of political Islam and the overriding mission of Islamist organizations like the HLF to their desire to contribute to the efforts of terror groups , like Hamas , " he said .
" When this connection is made we will see the return of a guilty verdict .
In future [ terrorism financing ] cases DOJ will not only have to connect the financial dots but [ will have ] to demonstrate an overarching common Islamist mission . "
Prosecutors say HLF was part of a Palestine Committee – a conglomerate of U.S. based Muslim organizations and individuals committed to helping Hamas financially and politically .
HLF was its fundraising arm , a designation formalized by Hamas deputy political director Mousa Abu Marzook in 1994 .
Support for Hamas became illegal with a 1995 executive order by President Bill Clinton and subsequent congressional action .
Defense attorneys say the men were simply providing desperately needed charity to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation .
HLF routed millions of dollars through a series of Palestinian charities known as zakat committees .
While Hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S.
Treasury , those zakat committees never were .
That , defense attorneys argued , meant donations to them did not violate the law .
" This is one of the most significant victories the Justice Department has won in the war on terror , " said Andrew McCarthy , who prosecuted blind cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 others for conspiring to blow up a series of New York landmarks .
" Financing is the life - blood of jihadist organizations like Hamas .
With the assistance of willing co-conspirators , they conceal their activities and use the Muslim obligation of charitable giving to mask support that is actually channeled to their murderous agenda .
Today 's verdicts say , loudly and clearly , that Americans are n't fooled and wo n't tolerate it .
As a former federal prosecutor , I am especially proud of the assistant U.S. attorneys who persevered through some real travails in securing justice for the American people . "
Journalist Douglas Farah studied the HLF evidence on behalf of the Nine Eleven Finding Answers ( NEFA ) Foundation and was the first to identify the significance of a Muslim Brotherhood memorandum outlining the group 's ambitions in America .
He said Monday 's verdict has implications for unindicted co-conspirators in the case – most notably the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) - because it validates what already was " a clear public record of why these groups were founded and how . "
The Muslim Brotherhood memo called for " a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘ sabotaging ' its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God 's religion is made victorious over all other religions . "
CAIR is listed as a member of the Brotherhood 's Palestine Committee and founders Omar Ahmad and Nihad Awad are included on a telephone list of committee members .
CAIR has not refuted the evidence , Farah said .
Government officials ought to study that evidence to realize CAIR is not what it presents itself as .
" The main currency CAIR and these groups have is their access , " he said .
" The time is now , with full justification and with a full public record - not a whispering campaign , not innuendo – for the government to now say without hesitation : you do n't have access here .
We do n't want to deal with you . "
After the verdicts were read , jurors were asked to determine whether convictions for money laundering meant HLF assets should be forfeited to the government , the Dallas Morning News reported .
Jurors agreed $ 12.4 million from the defendants ' assets should be forfeited .

History of how arms company workers struggled against closure and for a change in their work from weapons manufacture to socially useful production .
In the 1970s workers at the Lucas Aerospace Company in Britain set out to defeat the bosses plans to axe jobs .
They produced their own alternative " Corporate Plan " for the company 's future .
In doing so they attacked some of the underlying priorities of capitalism .
Their proposals were radical , arguing for an end to the wasteful production of military goods and for people ’s needs to be put before the owners ’ profits .
Military Matters
Lucas Aerospace in the early 70s was one of Europe 's largest designers and manufacturers of aircraft systems and equipment .
It had over 18,000 workers on its payroll , spread over 15 factories , throughout Britain .
Nearly half of its business was related to military matters - in production of combat aircraft and the Sting Ray missile system for NATO ( pictured , above ) .
But it also had small interests in medical technologies .
The company had been formed into the size it was through the take - overs and amalgamations of smaller size companies .
It had been backed by the Government of the day who wanted a strong and efficient aerospace company to compete with the other European manufacturers .
As part of achieving this Management planned to rationalise the whole 15 - factory operation into a more integrated and streamlined company .
This would mean lay - offs for at least 20 % of the workforce and the closure of some areas .
The prize for the owners of Lucas in doing this would be a much greater involvement in the military markets where profit rates were very high compared with other industries .
Poor Wages
The intentions of the company owners and management did not go unnoticed by the Lucas workers or their Shop Stewards Combine Committee ( SSCC ) .
The origins of the SSCC was in the strong trade union tradition at the time in Britain though particularly in the aerospace industry .
Over a period of years the workers in the different unions had seen the need to co-ordinate their negotiations against a single management so as to avoid poor wage increases as one section was paid off at the expense of the others .
So they formed shop stewards committees that bridged their different union memberships .
As the company had grown bigger these shop steward committees from different areas also linked up to carry on the same idea of meeting the management with a single voice for all workers in any negotiations .
Struggle pays
The SSCC at Lucas which linked all the company sites had not , however , come about without much effort or struggle .
It had grown to the importance it had because of its involvement with the direct rank and file struggles of workers there and was looked to by many far more than their individual unions or full time union officials .
One of the most spectacular successes of the SSCC was in the Burnley strike in 1972 when by means of mobilising the support of all Lucas workers , a 13 week strike by Burnley workers was carried to a successful conclusion leading to a wage increase 167 % larger than that nationally negotiated by the union officials !
The SSCC in the course of the strike had organised widespread collections and support meetings for the striking workers and had backed this up with strategic work stoppages at different plants that had maximised the losses to the company with the minimum loss in pay .
The support action co-ordinated by the SSCC was extremely effective and eventually saw management capitulating despite their previous claim that they would n't give the workers a penny extra .
After the Burnley strike , the SSCC was able to achieve much better pay and conditions for all union workers at Lucas .
Local disputes in the company were often settled through sympathy action co-ordinated by the SSCC .
Management was unable to break the new - found unity and was fearful of any large strike , like that at Burnley , breaking out again .
Useful jobs
It was against this background that the SSCC in 1976 proposed the alternative Corporate Plan ( below ) to Lucas 's management .
It was the product of two years planning and debate among Lucas workers .
Everyone from unionised engineers , to technicians to production workers and secretaries was involved in drawing it up .
It was based on detailed information on the machinery and equipment that all Lucas sites had , as well as the type of skills that were in the company .
Its central aim was to head off Lucas 's planned job cuts by arguing that the concentration on military goods and markets was neither the best use of resources nor in itself desirable .
It argued that if Lucas was to look away from military production it could expand into markets for " socially useful " goods where it already had some expertise and sales .
If this was done no job losses would be needed .
The Plan itself did considerable market research for what was needed to replace the military goods and what Lucas could actually make .
According to it Lucas could eventually wind down its military production , keeping all its present workforce .
In other words no job losses at all were envisaged .
Moreover , the production of high technology equipment like kidney dialysis machines would be of far more benefit than Sting - Ray missiles to society .
The workforce would be much more happy with this from the point of view of jobs and the quality of work .
Shunned by bosses
Lucas 's owners and management did not however place a very high value on either the provision of work or its quality .
When the Plan was presented to them they shunned it .
They resented " their workers telling them what to do " and insisted on the Company 's commitment to defence production .
The job cuts and rationalisations were to continue .
... and union leaders
The full time union officials half - heartedly pledged their support for the Plan , but did nothing to widen the support among other trade unionists for it .
This partly reflected their antagonism to the radical proposals of the Plan which went outside , by a long stretch , the cosy wage negotiations they were used to .
But also they were antagonistic to the SSCC which they saw as getting above its station .
They were worried that the influence of the SSCC and the hornets ’ nest it was stirring about job cuts and " socially useful " production might spread beyond their control even more than it already had .
Maintaining the status quo was particularly important to them also at this time because of the pact signed between the Union leaders and the Labour Party Government which was aimed at taming the demands of union members in return for more say for the Union bosses in " national policy " .
Sell out
The Labour Party similarly , now forming the Government , applauded the Plan but spent their time avoiding it like the plague .
It reflected some of the weak politics , however , of the SSCC that they had turned to them at all .
It was the British Government ( with active Labour Party involvement ) which in the first instance had supported Lucas 's move to a competitive military manufacturer for NATO .
Like all " socialists " in Government they had promptly forgotten their commitment to help the workers ’ movement .
Direct action
If it was direct industrial action that had built the SSCC into what it was and gave it the confidence to produce the likes of the alternative Corporate Plan , then it would have been the same industrial action that would have carried it forward further .
That such direct action by the workers was not looked to by the SSCC in the aftermath of its rejection by the Lucas bosses reflected major weaknesses .
Looking to the Labour Party was a huge weakness since it presupposed that Labour really had the interests of the workers at heart , which it did n't .
The Labour Party in Government was looking after the interests of the British state .
It was not going to challenge capitalism - or its values - which the Lucas Plan did at root .
Workers , as became clear , only had themselves to look to for help .
If the SSCC looked to this they may have got somewhere .
To some this response of management 's was not very surprising .
But these people were in the minority .
The bulk of the SSCC while expecting an argument and some tough negotiations were totally taken aback at the response .
As one AUEW shop steward put it : " Quite honestly , I thought the Company would have welcomed it ... that they would see it as constructive trade unionism ... " .
Profits first
Constructive it may have been if the world was being run along different lines - ones that valued people ’s need for meaningful work and put social needs above military production .
The company 's owners were adamant that this was n't the way things were going to be .
For them capitalism was the order of the day and this meant profits first and foremost .
Moreover it was their right to " manage ” Lucas and to decide where its resources would be used .
To them the 18,000 people working at Lucas had no say in these fundamental matters .
In the aftermath of the Lucas Plan they determined to break the SSCC and its influence , which as we will see they did .
Labour Party
If the rejection of the Plan came as a surprise to the SSCC , the aftermath put them in a spot - what to do next .
Previous to this when management had stalled or rejected their demands they had returned the matter to the rank and file workers where industrial action of some sort had been used to shift the company .
But this time , this did not happen .
Instead the SSCC turned their attention to winning the Labour Party and the full - time Union officials to their cause .
In doing this , they spent less and less time in consultation with the workforce at Lucas .
The workers there who would have had the most to fight for and to gain from the Plan became less informed .
Even the regular news - sheet previously produced by SSCC became more and more irregular , eventually disappearing altogether , Slowly the unity built up in previous times was whittled away as SSCC members were now spending a huge degree of time meeting Labour MPs and Ministers - neglecting the real job of maintaining their workplace organisation .
Job cuts
As the lobbying of Labour Party MPs and Union bosses continued , Lucas 's management proceeded with the job cuts and rationalisations where they could .
With the SSCC busy lobbying but not co-ordinating any action , unity weakened among the workforce .
Different areas were left to fend for themselves .
With this situation Management did have the upper hand and used it .
Some local victories were won by workers and jobs saved .
Mainly this was through industrial action of some sort to force implementation of parts of the Plan .
But this situation was a poor replacement for the unity and strength of previous times .
Inevitably when jobs went , activists and in particular some of the main workers behind the SSCC were victimised .
Once again , as has too often happened in Britain , faith in the Labour Party was a slippery slope to being sold out and losing the fight , Lucas workers had got to where they had through their own actions and organising capacity - it was this that would have been the way forward .
The Alternative Plan -
What the Lucas plan proposed
What was the alternative Lucas Corporate Plan ?
Over a period of two years a series of proposals that later became known as the Lucas Plan were drawn together through the active involvement of most of the workers in the 15 different Lucas factories .
Its aim was to shift Lucas Aerospace , as a company away from the production of military goods , mainly for NATO ( an emphasis that was capital intensive and had high profit margins for Lucas 's owners ) and towards the production of socially useful goods ( which was a labour intensive field , relying more on the skills already in the Lucas Company ) .
Such a shift would mean the preservation of jobs at Lucas and the fulfilment of some of the more pressing needs of society .
Here is what was proposed :
Medical Equipment :
- Increase production of kidney dialysis machines by 40 % and look into the development of a portable model .
- Build up a ' design for the disabled ' unit , with the Ministry of Health , to look into things like artificial limb control systems ( which could use Lucas 's control engineering expertise ) , sight aids for the blind , developing the ' Hobcart ' .
This vehicle was designed in the 1970s by an apprentice at Lucas to give mobility to children suffering from Spina Bifida .
Lucas management had refused to develop it on the grounds that it was incompatible with their product range .
- Manufacture an improved life - support system for ambulances .
An ex-Lucas engineer turned doctor had offered to help design and build a prototype for this , using a simple heat exchanger and pumping system .
Alternative Energy Techniques :
Due to the finite availability of fuels like coal and petrol , they proposed that Lucas concentrate on renewable sources of energy generation and developing more efficient methods of energy conservation from fuel sources .
Up to 60 % of energy is lost with traditional forms of its use ( car engines etc. ) .
Moreover this would provide a real alternative to nuclear power generation which was unsafe and damaging to the environment .
- Development and production of heat pumps which were efficient in saving waste heat .
Such heat pumps would be used in new housing schemes to provide a very cheap service .
- Development and production of solar cells and fuel cells .
- Development of windmills .
Lucas 's experience in aerodynamics would be invaluable .
- Development of a flexible power pack , which could easily adjust to people 's situations allowing for small scale electricity generation using basic raw materials .
Such instruments would be invaluable in under - developed countries where electricity provision is very poor .
Transportation :
- The development of a road - rail public transportation vehicle which would be light - weight using pneumatic tyres on rails .
Such a system would be cheaper , safer for use and more integrated .
It would allow rail services to be provided in areas where they were being closed down , etc .
The road - rail vehicle would be able to travel on rails mainly but also convert to road use when needed .
- A combined internal combustion engine / battery powered car which could give up to 50 % fuel savings while reducing toxic emission from cars .
The Plan proposed various other ideas in the areas of braking systems , undersea exploration technology and remote control devices .
The thrust of the Lucas Plan was radical from the beginning .
It asked basic questions like what was the real use of Sting Ray missiles and high technology fighter aeroplanes to society .
Their production gobbled up money resources and technical inventiveness , making those who owned the Companies richer and richer but society got nothing from them .
Waste
Basic needs in society are only filled inadequately , like for instance kidney dialysis machines , whose general shortage in society was then and still is a crying shame .
Lucas , its workers argued , had the expertise to develop better , smaller and more mobile units which kidney sufferers were crying out for .
Why should n't they do so ?
Worse still , under a system that produces high quantities of weapons and armaments , not only is money wasted but also much human technology and innovation is wasted or misused as well .
Take the proposal by the Lucas workers that the sophisticated radar systems used in modern fighter planes be used in the development of an " alternative sight " aid for blind people .
Such a thing is easily within human capabilities , but is not made or even developed as a priority now .
Under capitalism the world 's resources and wealth is owned and used to make profit for the wealthy .
Most money is invested where profit is highest .
The fulfilment of human needs is always a secondary priority The Lucas Plan challenged many of the basic assumptions of capitalism : why should profits come before people ?
What value have military goods in a world with so many other pressing needs ?
As such it was important .
But far more fundamentally it showed what capacity workers have to articulate their priorities and their values .
Anarchism
For the future it showed what enormous potential a society based on socialism could have .
Such a society with real workplace democracy and the participation of all in the management of society would allow for the creative capacity of each individual to have its say while the real needs of society are met .
But for this to be achieved as the Lucas workers learned , capitalism and its priorities must be overthrown .

Corn is a small * music playing daemon .
It strikes a balance between nerdy programmable flexibility and modern desktop integration .
key features
Uses libxine for playback -- supports the many file formats that xine does .
Uses D- BUS and the MPRIS standard for inter-process communication .
Scriptable via any language with D - BUS bindings , or via mpris-remote on the command line , and compatible with a number of other MPRIS - speaking programs and libraries .
Uses GIO / GVFS to access media files locally or through a number of protocols .
( SFTP , HTTP , FTP , WebDAV , SMB , inside of gzipped / bzipped tarballs )
Uses SQLite for metadata storage .
Stores all metadata but scans it lazily , so importing music and beginning playback is fast .
Is fairly small and simple , especially for a program in C : around 2000 lines of code .
useful links
Corn is a fork of Quark .
never - asked - but - anticipated questions
do n't have a dbus session bus running ?
If you use startx with a smaller window manager instead of a full blown desktop environment , you may not have a dbus session bus running .
The system bus ( dbus - daemon -- system in your ps output ) will not do -- it is not for communication between user apps .
To get a session bus running , put this in your .xinitrc :
if test - z " $ DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS " ; then eval `dbus - launch -- sh- syntax -- exit - with - session` fi
selecting an audio driver
For me , libxine by default tries to connect to a pulse audio daemon with a timeout , which caused a startup delay for corn .
But corn has its own xine config file , which is at ~/.config/corn/xine_config .
You can just symlink it to ~/.xine / config if you want corn to use the same libxine settings as the xine program , or it can be its own separate file .
Here is my xine_config :
audio.driver:alsa engine.decoder_priorities.mad:1000
Corn actually uses kind of a lot of memory right now ( 60 - 80 MB for me ) .
This is a libxine problem , apparently due to it allocating tons of unnecessary buffers .
Supposedly it will be fixed sometime .
But even until then -- hey -- 80 MB is only about 4 % of 2GB !
What I really care about when it comes to smallness is the size and complexity of the code .
( OrganicJar )
The rotten economy is eating into sales of organic foods as fewer Americans put these often costly groceries on their plates .
Overall sales of organic food are still rising , though the industry 's robust growth of recent decades is tapering off .
Many devotees of organic foods are not willing to cut back though .
Despite the challenges , the Organic Trade Association forecasts sales of organic foods will rise by 18 percent a year , on average , through 2010 .
The association expects its customer base to grow on the assumption that prices will drop and mainstream retailers will stock a wider variety of products .
A July 2008 survey found that among customers who reported buying organic products , 56 percent had household incomes of more than $ 100,000 and 36 percent had incomes of less than $ 25,000 .
Still , shoppers at all income levels appear to be reducing purchases of organics these days .
Even I find it hard to pay $ 7.99 for 4 oz of organic blueberries .
Here are some foods that you do n’t ‘ have ’ to buy organic because they have a very low pesticide rating .

When Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 , he reportedly turned to his press secretary , the now well - known journalist Bill Moyers , and said , “ We have lost the South for a generation . ”
I think it ’s safe to say we ’ve seen something similar this week .
Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans blocked a bailout for the auto industry late Thursday night , leaving the Big 3 and the hundreds of thousands who rely on them for their daily wages in the lurch .
Here ’s the key point : McConnell and company did n’t decide that ruining Christmas for thousands of families was worth it because they felt Detroit needs to be retrofitted for a 21st century economy and that that fundamental realignment can only happen by scrapping the whole operation and starting over under new management .
That would be a legitimate reason for opposing the bailout .
I ’m not sure I agree with it — if we have hundreds of billions for the financial industry , I ’m sure we can find some for the automakers that the government can tie to innovation benchmarks and new management quotas .
But it ’s a reasonable position to take .
No , the GOP decided that they would block the auto industry bailout because they could n’t take a big enough jab at the United Auto Workers union .
Both Democrats and the UAW agreed that Detroit ’s workers should lower their wages and reduce their benefits to match those of Toyota , Nissan , and Honda workers in the United States .
They wanted to do it by 2011 .
The Republicans wanted it done by 2009 .
And because that difference could n’t be resolved , the GOP blocked the bailout and likely cratered a massive segment of the Michigan economy and a significant segment of the American economy .
And that ’s why I say Michigan — as recently as November a crucial presidential swing state — wo n’t vote Republican for a generation , or more .
Republicans can crow all they want about how they are letting the “ free market ” reign , but the free market does n’t vote .
Everyday people , who understand the Republican Party opposed a bailout of their industry because the screws being twisted on them were n’t being twisted enough , well , they do vote .
And they ’ll likely do anything they can to vote against McConnell and his pals .
Update :
There are two possibilities for saving the auto industry at this point .
( 1 ) If the Big 3 can find a way to limp through the holidays , the enlarged Democratic majorities that will take office on January 6 will find a way to pass a bailout , which the White House will then sign .
( 2 ) Treasury can bail out the auto industry using TARP funds .
There are already hints that this will happen .

Valve president Gabe Newell has reportedly told an anxious fan that he believes there is " a groundswell to abandon " DRM in PC games .
" As far as DRM goes , most DRM strategies are just dumb , " Newell , who is well known for corresponding directly with gamers via email , supposedly wrote in an exchange spotted by Tech in Hiding .
" The goal should be to create greater value for customers through service value ( make it easy for me to play my games whenever and wherever I want to ) , not by decreasing the value of a product ( maybe I 'll be able to play my game and maybe I won't ) .
" We really , really discourage other developers and publishers from using the broken DRM offerings , and in general there is a groundswell to abandon those approaches , " he concluded .
We 've contacted Valve to confirm whether the email 's genuine , but it certainly sounds like Newell .
He is of course one of the PC 's most dedicated proponents - Valve even flew journalists out to Seattle earlier this year to eulogise the format and discuss community features for distribution service Steam .
With DRM constantly in the news thanks to SecuROM and other unpopular measures and their impact on the consumer experience , his comments are likely to resonate with gamers who feel that DRM - embracing developers and publishers are misguided .

Study Confirms Amphibians ’
Ability to Predict Changes in Biodiversity
By Kim McDonald
Biologists have long suspected that amphibians , whose moist permeable skins make them susceptible to slight changes in the environment , might be good bellwethers for impending alterations in biodiversity during rapid climate change .
The study found that species turnover in amphibians more closely follows changes in the environment when compared to birds .
Credit : Lauren Buckley , UCSB
Now two University of California biologists have verified the predictive power of this sensitive group of animals in a global study of species turnover among amphibians and birds .
The study appears this week in the advance online version of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ Our study supports the role of amphibians as ‘ canaries in the coal mine ’ , ” said Lauren Buckley , a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Barbara 's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the first author of the study .
“ Amphibians are likely to be the first to respond to environmental changes and their responses can forecast how other species will respond . ”
“ Amphibians are much more tuned in to the changes in their specific environments , ” said Walter Jetz , an associate professor of biology at UC San Diego and the other author of the study .
“ They are much more sensitive to differences in environmental conditions as you move geographically from one location to another . ”
The two scientists used maps of the environment and amphibian and bird distributions to answer the question of how the environment — as well as the distribution of birds and amphibians — changes as one moves from one place to another around the globe .
The researchers found that if the environment changes rapidly as one travels from one location to another , the amphibian and bird communities also change rapidly .
However , the species of amphibians would change more quickly than species of birds .
This confirms that amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in the environment , the researchers conclude , and that this sensitivity is particularly acute given their narrow distributions .
Whether one is traveling through a tropical or temperature region also influences how quickly the types of animals change .
Given a mountain of a certain size , the researchers found , the amphibian and bird communities change more quickly if one is climbing a mountain in the tropics than in a temperate region .
“ There are more species in the tropics and the species are generally more specially adapted to particular environmental conditions , ” said Jetz .
“ This suggests that tropical species may be more severely impacted by a given temperature increase as a result of climate change . ”
For the study , he and Buckley produced a series of global maps of environmental turnover and the associated changes in amphibian and bird communities that reveal that the identities of birds and amphibians change particularly quickly in mountainous regions such as the Andes and Himalayas .
“ Understanding how environmental changes over space influence biodiversity patterns provides important background for forecasting how biodiversity will respond to environmental changes over time such as ongoing temperature increases , ” said Buckley .
The study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation , UC Santa Barbara and the State of California .

EA ’s Tough Sell
Awhile back , while I was living under a bus , I saw an article on Joystiq which pointed to a much larger article on Gamasutra , which in essence , said “ new IP for EA fails . ”
They ’re referring of course to the less than stellar launch of EA ’s new IP this quarter of Mirror ’s Edge and Dead Space .
While both articles seem to paint the failing economy and the consumer ’s lack of faith in spending money they might not have combined with the fact that “ new IP is hard to sell ” as the culprits , I think they ’re missing the larger point as to why they fell short .
I ’m pretty sure it is n’t the fact that they ’re new IP .
New IP is certainly difficult to get people to buy , if you compare it to selling a sequel , such as Madden , as the graph above ( liberally stolen from Joystiq who stole it from Gamasutra ) implies .
But the problem is that a blanket statement like that is patently false , and pretty easy to shoot holes in .
Left 4
Dead sold pretty well ( 450 k on Xbox 360 alone , and Valve never releases the Steam sales # s , so who knows how much better it did there ) .
Spore has sold upwards of two million units .
Both are new IP , so we can see that EA does n’t have much of a problem publishing new IP or getting consumer traction with them .
If we look to previous years IP , we can see that Gears of War ( the original ) sold what , three million units ?
Assassin ’s Creed sold something like six million units .
Even lame duck new IPs like Kane and Lynch sold well over a million .
So it ’s probably not that they ’re new IP .
Mirror ’s Edge was marketed out the wazoo , what with multiple comic books , flash animated web trailers , ads everywhere , and I ’m sure their internet “ buzz ” rating was high considering all of the pieces written about the main character and the first person nature of the parkouring .
Dead Space had a pretty high anticipation rate , at least in the quick straw poll amongst my friends and co-workers , so , why did n’t people buy it ?
The problem with this notion , is that I think people did buy them .
They bought them both used .
My team in particular grabbed Dead Space for competitive analysis used a mere four days after it had launched .
This is pretty much a death knell for any title , as the vast majority of your sales occurs within the first two weeks following launch .
To have those numbers crippled by used sales is horrible , but there ’s a reason why it happened .
Both games are relatively short single player games .
Sure , sure , there ’s some time trial business in Mirror ’s Edge , but I do n’t think that ’s a big draw for a lot of folks who bought it .
There is no great value to a repeat playthrough , especially since there is little to no branching content in either title , and it ’s my opinion that neither title was particularly innovative , either ( I ’m going to suffer the slings and arrows for this opinion , but I ’ll elaborate in a later piece ) .
So , I do n’t think there was a very large retention rate amongst consumers who didbuy it new .
They probably burned through the game in a two or three night playthrough , felt it was n’t worth the $ 64 they paid for it , traded them in and got something else for their money while the title still retained a high trade - in value , and moved on .
Meanwhile , people who missed out on the launch bandwagon were able to buy the title used less than a week after it hit the shelves .
While I would like to turn this into a hit piece on why used games are bad for the industry , I ’m instead going to take the route that I can impact and point out that we as developers need to deliver content that ’s worth keeping .
This means a single player campaign that lasts significantly longer than 6 - 10 hours , if there is n’t any multiplayer content .
Games like Spore and Fallout3 do this quite amicably , with something in the neighborhood of 25 - 50 hours of content .
Both titles also have a decently high replay rate , as it ’s nearly impossible to explore all of the game ’s content on a single playthrough .
Other Q4 titles such as Gears 2 or CoD:WaW have a high consumer retention value due to the extensive multiplayer aspects of the titles ( and the fact that they ’re sequels to highly successful franchises goes a long way to boot ) , so there is n’t a ton of used titles to be found , especially during the critical first month of sales .
There ’s some kind of secret formula here , one that should hopefully keep your title out of the hands of the used stockpiles , and while oversimplified , it goes something like this :
Single Player Content ~ 12 hours
Co-op or other networked non-competitive online play
Rich compelling multiplayer content , append - able with DLC
That ’s pretty much the CoD / Gears / Halo / L4D formula up there .
The Spore / Fallout / Oblivion / Final Fantasy example is much more simplistic :
Single Player Content > 25 hours
I ’m not saying I ’m any kind of rocket scienctist for throwing these formulas up here ; tons of people are already rolling their eyes at them .
The point here is that you just ca n’t release a game that takes 6 hours to play and expect people to throw out $ 64 for it .
I ’m sure both titles are at a reduced price now , but they launched at full retail price .
I do n’t care how new and innovative you think your IP is ( and let ’s be honest , neither Dead Space nor Mirror ’s Edge was horribly innovative or changed the game space we play or develop in ) , if you do n’t deliver the consumer “ their money ’s worth ” they ’re going to not give you all of their money , or worse , they ’re going to make sure you do n’t make it ( intentionally or no ) by returning your game as a used title and buying something else .
Consumers would n’t accept a movie that cost $ 10 to get into but only lasted for 40 minutes .
Why should we expect gamers to latch onto a retail model that delivers a similar value ?
New IP here is n’t the problem .
A small value per dollar is .
It 's not unusual to be reflective at the end of the year .
As the IGN team looks back , we realize just how many games we would 've loved to see , but did n't , in 2008 .
We all have games that we adored playing years ago , and there are plenty of franchises that we'd love to see resurrected .
So , we came up with a list of games that we think deserve to come back .
In fact , in some cases we demand it .
Read up on our list , and feel free to suggest the franchises that you want resurrected in the comments below .
Master of Orion
Okay , first of all , erase the memory of Master of Orion III from your minds .
That game is a scar upon the turn - based strategy bliss that was Master of Orion and Master of Orion II .
As a nascent , space - faring race you must reach for the stars , colonizing planets in distant systems .
The research system tied heavily into the ship design system , and that itself had a prominent role in combat .
Wars were often evolutionary struggles , as you continually researched weapons and countermeasures to adapt to new developments .
Alliances with other races could be forged and broken , and to keep the pressure on there were multiple routes to victory , including finding and conquering the legendary planet of Orion .
While Stardock has done its best in creating a Master of Orion - like experience with its Galactic Civilizations II games , we would love to see a proper sequel with all the bells and whistles that we 've come to expect .
Road Rash
Road Rash 2 seems to stick out in most gamers ' minds -- the 1992 Genesis version that allowed two - player split - screen .
Though the frame rate was sort of a mess , there was no denying the thrill of launching off hills , smashing rival bikers with chains and getting the timing just right to steal weapons from others .
The game 's visceral appeal and , at the time , engaging presentation has never really been matched throughout the rest of the series ' iterations .
There were some real less - than - impressive sequels , including the middling Road Rash 64 released in 1999 and Jailbreak for the GBA , but nothing 's managed to capture our attention like the series ' early entries .
Planescape : Torment
RPGs such as Planescape : Torment just do n't seem to get made anymore , especially ones with its style of presentation .
As part of the turn of the century explosion of Infinity Engine - based Black Isle games , Torment represents some of the best writing and characterization seen in gaming .
Perhaps that 's why it never rocketed to massive popularity ; gamers just did n't want to sit there and engage in deep , philosophical conversations with NPCs .
Yet with such a unique and beautifully constructed setting , an unrelentingly wicked sense of humor and powerful personalities , it 's really a shame we have n't seen a follow - up .
Syndicate
Syndicate was one of the first of the truly ruthless games , and by that we mean that it featured an extraordinary amount of violence for its time .
Its premise was one of the dystopian future variety -- powerful megacorporations waged war upon one another using cyborg agents .
These agents , armed with weapons like guns , lasers , bombs , and flamethrowers , then wreaked havoc upon the game 's cityscapes , gunning down civilians and opponents alike .
You could even use brainwashing abilities to turn innocent pedestrians into puppets , to be used as cannon fodder .
Yet there was more than just combat , as you had to balance taxation to generate funds , as well as manage research and development of new weapons and upgrades .
In the end , it made for a bloody great time .
Kid Icarus
Nintendo's Kid Icarus , about an angel named
Pit on a quest to restore order to the heavens , remains one of our favorite classic franchises .
The original , developed by the same team that created Metroid , features fun platforming challenges , a compelling character upgrade system , and most of all , stages so satisfyingly difficult you 'll want to pull your hair out .
And , just like Metroid , Icarus is " primed " for a comeback , a full 3D makeover , and new WIi controls for flying and shooting arrows .
All Nintendo need do is look to the cancelled Capcom GCN project Dead Phoenix , about a winged hero , for inspiration .
Vagrant Story
One of the more unique Square role - playing games of the PlayStation era , Vagrant Story might not have had the brand recognition of something like Final Fantasy , but it still proved to be a fantastic title that actually sold quite well .
The game combined a thrilling storyline with intricate battle mechanics and plenty of dungeon crawling , and unlike some of the other games on this list , it 's never had a proper sequel that builds on the gameplay elements or universe .
Though plenty has been done with the world of Ivalice in which Vagrant Story is set , it'd be great to see a reimagining of the game , a full - on sequel , or -- at the very least -- a rerelease with updated graphics and a new interface .
Star Control
With a title like Star Control : Famous Battles of the Ur- Quan Conflict , Volume IV , you had your first hint that this was a special game , and it was .
With its colorful universe and superb combat system , Star Control and its sequel burrowed a place in many gamers ' hearts .
Based on Spacewar ! , one of the earliest computer games ever made , Star Control let you participate in an interstellar war where you commanded a starship .
What made the game great was the design system , which let you customize your starship 's components .
Star Control
II introduced space exploration , as you had to explore alien worlds as well as interact with a wide range of alien species .
Star Control let you feel like you were exploring an incredible galaxy full of both danger and wonder .
Chrono Trigger
Yes , we know that Chrono Trigger had a sequel .
It was called Chrono Cross and was released in 2000 in the United States for the PlayStation , a platform the folks here at IGN liked very much .
But going back to the franchise progenitor on the Super NES ( if you can really call two games a franchise ) and you 've got to be wondering about an all - new entry .
This is particularly true since the recent release of Chrono Trigger on DS reminded everyone why the brand is so highly lauded in the first place , and is surely something most gamers out there would love to see .
Yet , we 've heard of no definite plans to build on one of the most celebrated RPG names out there , hence its inclusion on this list .
Wing Commander
Though it vies with TIE Fighter for the title of king of all space sims , Wing Commander was a different beast .
Wing Commander was an epic space opera in every conceivable way ; it featured memorable characters , a desperate war for survival , and a cinematic presentation that was well above the norms for its time .
It also introduced a rich universe with plenty of storytelling possibilities , as evident by the fact that it spawned numerous sequels and even a disastrous movie .
Meanwhile , the bitmapped visuals made Wing Commander the Crysis of its day .
Toss in the fact that this was one of the first games that really made rich use of sound , and it was the killer app that helped launch Creative 's Soundblaster audio cards .
We 'd love to see a modern - day Wing Commander , and given that EA still has a thing for live - action cutscenes ( just check out Red Alert 3 ) , we 'd love to see Mark Hamill back on the small screen once again .
Star Wars : TIE Fighter
TIE Fighter is a game that , 14 years after its release , still generates universal acclaim and plenty of fond memories from gamers everywhere .
It 's arguably the essential space sim , the pinnacle of a genre that dominated the industry in its early years .
The gameplay mechanics were a perfect blend of simulation and action , and it made you feel like you were taking part in a massive space battle not unlike those seen in the original Star Wars movie trilogy .
And this was a game that offered a unique perspective , letting you play as a loyal member of the Imperial Navy , looking to establish peace and order through a war - torn galaxy .
The game never veered from that view , and it actually made you proud when you moved up the ranks of the Emperor 's most trusted agents .
If we could beg George Lucas to bring back TIE Fighter , believe us , we would .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israeli airstrikes on Gaza continued for a fifth day Wednesday , as the Jewish state 's defense minister mulled a truce proposal to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza .
A column of Israeli armored vehicles is deployed in a farmer 's field Tuesday near the Gaza border .

The air assault overnight into Wednesday struck the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and the Hamas Interior Ministry , among other targets , the Israeli Defense Forces told CNN .
The airstrikes followed a mission Tuesday that leveled at least three buildings in a Hamas government compound .
The Israeli air force also blasted away at a series of tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt through the Rafah crossing .
Meanwhile , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak was considering the truce proposal -- originally raised by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner -- and would bring it to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for consideration , a Defense Ministry official said Tuesday .
However , Israeli Defense Forces denied earlier media reports saying it would advise Olmert to adopt a two - day truce .
Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz had reported " the goal of the temporary calm would be to see if Hamas can abide by the truce and cease firing rockets at Israel . "
Kouchner called Olmert Tuesday afternoon about the proposal , French Foreign Ministry sources said .
France , which holds the rotating European Union presidency until Thursday , had brought together foreign ministers in Paris to address the situation in Gaza and in southern Israel .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's office said Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will meet Sarkozy in Paris on Thursday .
The Israeli military says it was targeting only Hamas militants , blaming them for rocket fire into southern Israel .
Hamas has vowed to defend Gaza in the face of what it calls continued Israeli aggression .
Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian - brokered cease - fire , which formally expired December 19 but had been weakening for months .

Meanwhile , U.S. President George W. Bush called Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to discuss a " sustainable cease - fire , " White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters in Crawford , Texas .
And the Middle East quartet -- comprised of the United States , the United Nations , Russia and the European Union -- conferred on a conference call about the situation .
However , Gaza is controlled by Hamas -- considered a terrorist group by Israel and the United States .
Neither will negotiate with Hamas leadership , which seeks an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state .
A Hamas spokesman said he did n't consider a temporary truce feasible now .
" There is nowhere to talk about just the 48 - hours cease - fire , " Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told CNN's " Situation Room " on Tuesday .
" We have to talk about an end for this attack , Israeli attacks against the Palestinians and opening all of the borders for the Palestinians to have aid -- either medical aid or another other kind of support -- and then we can talk about the politics . "
The United Nations has called for both sides to end the violence , and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has roundly condemned both sides : Hamas for the rocket fire and Israel for its " excessive use of force " in retaliating .
Despite the rumblings on a potential truce , Olmert warned earlier Tuesday the airstrikes were only the beginning of a wider military operation , telling Peres , " We are currently at the first stage of the operation , " Israeli government officials said .
Of the 375 Palestinians killed , most were Hamas militants , Palestinian medical sources said Tuesday .
U.N. officials said at least 60 civilians were among the dead .
Watch why the U.N. is frustrated »
Among the dead were two girls , ages 4 and 11 , who were killed early Tuesday , as they rode in a donkey - driven cart in Beit Hanoun , sources said .
On the Israeli side , three civilians and a soldier have been killed in rocket attacks from Gaza on southern Israel since the campaign began Saturday , military officials and police said .
" They are committed to our destruction , " Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of Hamas .
" They 're firing missiles at our civilians .
They 're hiding behind their civilians .
That 's a double war crime right there . "
Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti , however , has called the raids a " war on the Palestinian people " and said the incursion is politically motivated .
The armed wing of Hamas , the Izzedine al - Qassam Brigades , said it would continue launching rockets into Israel if " the aggression continues , " a masked spokesman said in televised comments .
The spokesman said the group had " so far " launched 250 rockets into Israel .
Israel also has moved tanks to the outskirts of Gaza and called up at least 2,000 army reservists -- sparking fears of a ground incursion into the Palestinian territory .
On Tuesday , the Israeli Cabinet approved a Defense request for an additional 2,500 soldiers to be called up if needed .

The escalating violence in Gaza triggered worldwide demonstrations for both sides .
A group of students stormed inside the British embassy in Tehran on Tuesday , the state - run Fars news agency reported .

Protests also took place in the U.S. cities of Miami and New York .

In the Mediterranean Sea , an Israeli patrol vessel struck a boat carrying medical volunteers and supplies to Gaza early Tuesday as it attempted to intercept the vessel , witnesses and Israeli officials said .
Watch CNN 's Karl Penhaul describe the collision »
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor called allegations that the boat was deliberately rammed " absurd " and countered that the volunteer vessel was trying to outmaneuver the Israeli boat .
Israel has allowed dozens of trucks carrying relief supplies into Gaza .
Also , the Rafah border crossing to Egypt was opened temporarily Tuesday to allow aid workers and medical supplies into Gaza and to transport injured Palestinians to hospitals in Al Arish , about 19 miles from the border , Egyptian journalist Shahira Amin said .
Doctors in Al Arish said they were treating 36 wounded Palestinians , at least six of whom were critically injured and being transferred to a hospital in Cairo , Egypt , for treatment .

This is more proof that :
There 's no reining in this horse 's tail ... it 's 12ft 6in , making it the longest in the world
If she were a racehorse , she could have her nose in front and still be a tail - ender .
And with a tail measuring a staggering 12ft 6in long , Summer Breeze has gone down in history as the horse with the longest in the world .
The mare , who lives in Kansas in the U.S. , has been officially recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records and owner Crystal Socha certainly has a job keeping her animal groomed to perfection .
Scroll down to see a video of Summer
Summer Breeze , a Kansas mare , has been recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as having the longest recorded horse tail in the world at 12ft 6in
Crystal , 26 , combs out and shampoos the horse 's tail once every two months and the operation takes her around three hours .
Each hair strand has the consistency of the fishing line .
' She 's our little queen .
She knows it , too , ' said Ms Socha who owns the horse together with her brother , Casey , at Hoof Print Farm in Augusta , Kansas .
Owner Crystal Socha spends three hours shampooing the tail every two months
' I do n't think I 've ever gotten every knot out of that tail , ' she continued .
' It takes a lot longer in the summer when she 's flicking at flies .
' When it 's out and it 's flowing , then I know why it 's worth it . '
Wind it up :
The horse cannot wear her tail freely outside the arena and has to have it fastened up
According to her owner , Summer , who is 11 - years - old , was born with a normal sized tail .
But as she aged , her tail just kept on growing .
When she is outside the arena , her owners sometimes have to bunch her tail up and fasten it up .
She also has an impressive mane , which has had to be groomed to stop her chewing it off when she eats her food .
She is renowned at the the annual EquiFest event held at the Kansas Coliseum in Wichita where she gets into the arena to show off her champion tail .
Traveling for the holidays ?
No need to fear missing your plane because you ’ve lost your government issued I.D. !
You can fly without it — as long as you know the color of your house .
A few weeks ago I lost my wallet , or maybe it was stolen .
But I had to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco , and I did n’t have a single piece of identification — no passport , driver ’s license , credit card , work I.D. , nothing .
When I got to LAX , I approached the uniformed Transportation Security Administration agent nearest the entrance to the security screening area .
She had the power to ruin my day , and we both knew it .
But I was sweet , and she was only slightly superior in return .
I was really happy to get on that plane that day .
But I was n’t thrilled to learn that instant access to satellite images is a government tool of airport identification .
“ Do you have anything ? ” she asked .
“ A library card ?
A bill addressed to you at your home ? ”
I shook my head from side to side , pitifully .
The agent summoned the supervisor .
He carried a clipboard and something that looked like a cross between a World War II - era walkie - talkie and a 1990s cellphone .
“ Please write your name and address on this form , ” he said .
“ Then I have to make a call .
The gentleman I call will ask you a series of questions to help us verify your identify . ”
I filled out the form super - neatly , so I would n’t seem like a nervous terrorist , and the supervisor placed a call on his phone - a- ma - jig to an intentionally unidentified person who I came to think of as the Voice .
The Voice spoke to me directly .
“ Have you ever lived in the Washington , D.C. , area ? ” the Voice inquired .
“ Yes , a number of years ago , ” I said .
“ Do you now live in a gated community ? ” asked the Voice .
My neighborhood is n’t technically gated , but there ’s only one road in and out , so I answered , “ Yes . ”
That was the right answer .
The final question from the Voice , the one that got me through the backscatter machine , past the shoe swipe - o- meter and onto the plane , was a stunning surprise : “ What color is your house ? ”
“ Green , ” I told the Voice , who then asked me to hand the phone back to the supervisor .
The supervisor and the Voice then began chatting about how nice my house was .
By chance , when I got back home , I had an email waiting for me from Mr. Peter E. Sand , director of privacy technology at the US Department of Homeland Security in Washington .
He was inquiring about a book I ’d written .
I quickly emailed him back about my experience at LAX .
How did they know the color of my house ?
Why did they ask me that ?
Sand volunteered to put my questions to someone who might know the answer .
That person turned out to be Peter Pietra , the director of privacy policy and compliance at TSA .
This was Pietra ’s exact reply : “ [ Y ] ou are not allowed to fly unless you can present acceptable I.D. to match up with your boarding pass .
Because we know this can be a problem for people who 've lost / forgotten I.D. or may not have acceptable I.D. , we developed a process to help passengers who want help by using a variety of ways to try to verify that the person standing at the checkpoint without I.D. is actually the person on the boarding pass .
While this typically involves asking questions from commercial databases like Lexis - Nexis or Choicepoint , sometimes they will try to look the address up on Google Earth and see if there are questions they can ask that someone at that address should be able to know .
( What is a cross street , is there a park across the street , etc . )
To get the house color I assume the house must have a photo on Google Earth or some similar website . ”
The idea that an airport official can tell me the color of my house as a favor to me when I lose my wallet is a bit disconcerting .
I was really happy to get on that plane that day .
But I was n’t thrilled to learn that instant access to satellite images is a government tool of airport identification .
It feels invasive .
And does knowing the color of my house really prove that I am me , anyway ?
I could almost accept government use of invasive - feeling technologies if such technology were used consistently , by all levels of government , without infringing on civil liberties .
But although the government sometimes makes scarily efficient use of technology , it sometimes does the opposite by failing to make use of technology , with terrible consequences for personal freedom .
Here is a case in point .
Last month , my nephew ’s house was robbed .
( He lives in Atlanta and I think his house is yellow . )
The thief stole electronic toys , computers , and televisions .
My frantic nephew called the police to report the crime .
When they arrived , they asked my nephew his name , and of course he told them .
They placed him under arrest .
The police claimed my nephew was wanted in Tennessee for drug offenses .
My nephew has a fairly common name , and when they heard it , the police arrested him and dragged him to jail , leaving his wife and four children behind in a state of shocked disbelief .
One would have thought that big-city police would have electronic access to arrest records , photographs , fingerprints , and other information .
They should be able to clear up a case of mistaken identity speedily .
But my nephew sat in the Fulton County jail for two days .
It took two whole days for a judge to order him set free .
Get the irony ?
It took two minutes for TSA to determine to its satisfaction that I was the lady who lived in the green house in Pennsylvania .
But it took two days for a big - city police department to determine that a man , a crime victim , found inside his own family home was in fact who he said he was , and not some guy with a similar name from Ohio wanted for selling dope in Tennessee
Proof again that technology is only as good as the people who use it — or refuse to use it .

( CNN ) -- A " suspicious " fire devastated the church attended by Alaska Gov. and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Friday night in her hometown of Wasilla , the church 's minister said .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reportedly apologized for the possibility the fire was related to her nomination .
" We have no idea what caused it , " the Rev. Larry Kroon of the Wasilla Bible Church said Saturday , adding that investigators were considering arson and other possible causes .
A ladies ' craft group was in the building when the fire broke out , but they got out safely , Kroon said .
" No one was hurt , " he said .
Central Mat -Su Fire Department Chief James
Steele said the department was " treating it as suspicious and as potential arson at this point " but did not elaborate , The Anchorage Daily News reported .
The newspaper said Palin released a statement after the fire in which she said she stopped by the church Saturday morning and offered an apology to the assistant pastor " if the incident is in any way connected to the undeserved negative attention the church has received since she became a vice presidential candidate . "
Steele said that as many as 40 firefighters from his and neighboring departments fought the blaze , which started about 9:40 p.m. Friday ( 1:40 a.m. ET Saturday ) .
Firefighters were on the scene dealing with hot spots until about 5 a.m. Saturday , the Anchorage Daily News reported .
The metal church building , which normally accommodates Sunday congregations of up to 1,000 people , was heavily damaged by flames and smoke , Kroon said .
" The fire investigators and insurance people are there now .
There 's definitely a lot of damage .
I 've heard the figure of $ 1 million , but I do n't know for sure , " he said .
Kroon said he was not at the church when the fire broke out and would not discuss what any of the church members who were there had reported to him .
He would not specify how many people were in the building at the time of the blaze .
" They were all adults , and they all got out .
We 're trying not to talk about specifics while investigators are still working on finding out what happened . "
Kroon said the nondenominational church , which he described as " just a local community church , " is about 30 years old and the church building itself is about 2½ years old .
The pastor said church services would be held on schedule Sunday in a nearby school .

CAIRO , Dec 25 : An Egyptian court on Thursday jailed a teacher for six years for kicking a schoolboy to death after he failed to do his homework , a court official said .
Mathematics teacher Haitham Nabil Abdel Hamid was convicted of manslaughter after kicking 11 - year - old Islam Amro Badr in the stomach in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria in October .
The boy fainted and died shortly after in hospital , with several students saying they saw Abdel Hamid kick Badr .
A coroner testified in court that Badr had four broken ribs , Egypt ’s Al - Masry al - Yom newspaper reported earlier this week , amid emotional scenes in court from the boy ’s family .
The teacher ’s lawyer was quoted as saying that , “ Hitting ( a child ) is not banned in schools and my client did not break the law . ” — AFP
ATLANTA 
Three weeks after temporarily sparing a Georgia inmate from the death penalty , the United States Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear his appeal , a decision that will probably lead to a quick execution .
The inmate , Troy A. Davis , 40 , was convicted in 1991 of murdering Mark A. MacPhail , a Savannah police officer .
The court ’s decision , made without comment or explanation , allows Georgia officials to obtain a new death warrant and schedule the execution , probably in the next few days or weeks .
The case has led to an outpouring of support for Mr. Davis , largely because seven of nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony , with two claiming that the police had pressured them to testify against him .
Prosecutors presented no physical evidence and no murder weapon , and three witnesses have said another man admitted to the murder .
World leaders including former President Jimmy Carter , Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and Pope Benedict XVI have challenged the fairness of Mr. Davis ’s conviction .
Microsoft is trying to sweeten the deal in its bribery -- er , sorry , promotion -- to get you to use its Live.com search engine .
The company has just announced plans to make its Cashback program even more instant .
Am I the only one getting tired of this ?
Instant Reward
The Cashback initiative , first launched in May , essentially offers money in exchange for using the Live search protocol .
When you find and buy products through a Live search query , Microsoft sends you a certain percentage of the cost back .
Initially , that payment process took about 60 days to complete .
With Monday 's new development , eBay - oriented purchases will result in cash being deposited into your PayPal account instantly instead .
You 're The Mouse
Basically , Microsoft is running a variation on a psychological concept known as operant conditioning .
Think of yourself for a moment as a mouse in a scientist 's box , being trained to peck a lever ( which , in this case , represents a Live search query ) .
Originally , your reward -- a food pellet -- came out two months later .
Now , your pellet comes out within seconds .
It 's straight out of a Psych 101 textbook :
The more instant the reward , the more likely the animal is to be trained on the behavior .
It only makes sense .
B.F. Skinner would be proud .
Number Crunching
Here 's the problem , though : Despite Microsoft 's recent claims that its efforts were succeeding -- those claims , by the way , were based on a study Microsoft itself commissioned -- the numbers just do n't add up .
Offering a few bucks may get people to use the service once , but it 's not enough to get them to leave their preferred product behind for good .
Do n't take my word for it .
Check out traffic measurement company ComScore 's analysis of the shifting search market share over the past several months :
April 2008 ( before Microsoft launched Live Cashback )
• Microsoft : 9.1 %
• Google : 61.6 %
• Yahoo : 20.4 %
October 2008 ( most recent rankings ) :
• Microsoft : 8.5 %
• Google : 63.1 %
• Yahoo : 20.5 %
So since starting the Cashback program , Microsoft has actually lost almost 6.6 percent of its search market share .
Google , in contrast , has continued its upward climb , gaining 2.4 percent -- and without paying its users a dime .
For crying out loud , even Yahoo has managed to inch upward despite its endless public humiliations and nearly nonstop stock plummeting .
Gimmick , Schmimmick
Shortly after the Cashback launch , Google 's director of business product management summed it up fairly well :
" We have no plans to pay users to use our product , " he said .
" Our fundamental belief is that we should compete by building a great user experience ... rather than paying users nickels and dimes . "
Gimmicks do n't equate to long - term customer loyalty -- powerful products and services do .
All the Cashbacks , SearchPerks , or even rumored rebrandings can't mask what 's beneath the surface .
You can call the Big Mac a " gourmet steak " and give me five free coupons to try it .
I might even redeem a few of them .
But in the end , I 'm going to go back to my favorite local burger joint .
Why ?
Because I know it , I like it , and I trust it .
And in the end , it just tastes better .
Right now , Google is that tasty little place .
Sure , it may be too greasy every now and then , and sometimes the cook does shortchange you on fries .
When it comes down to it , though , it 's still the best burger around .
Microsoft may be offering some flashy deals , but its offering always seems to come up a few pickles short of satisfying -- and putting it in a shinier wrapper or giving me an extra quarter off the cost is n't going to change that .
Man , all this search engine talk is making me hungry .
Fractals : they ’re famously found in nature and artists have created some incredible renderings as well .
Fractals are purely a wonder – too irregular for Euclidean geometry ; iterative and recursive and seemingly infinite .
They turn up in food and germs , plants and animals , mountains and water and sky .
Here are seventeen stunning examples :
1. Sea shells

The nautilus is one of the most famous examples of a fractal in nature .
The perfect pattern is called a Fibonacci spiral .
2 . Snow flake

Lightning ’s terrifying power is both awesome and beautiful .
The fractals created by lightning are fascinatingly arbitrary and irregular .
4. Romanescu

A special type of broccoli , this cruciferous and tasty cousin of the cabbage is a particularly symmetrical fractal .
Cook it for your favorite mathematician .
5. Fern

The delicate Queen Anne ’s Lace , which is really just wild carrot , is a beautiful example of a floral fractal .
Each blossom produces smaller iterative blooms .
This particular image was shot from underneath to demonstrate the fractal nature of the plant .
7. Broccoli

Males of both the white peacock and standard peacock variety are resplendent examples of fractals in the animal kingdom .
Trivia : the white peacock is not an albino .
9. Pineapple
The pineapple is an unusual fruit that is , in fact , a fractal .
Though often associated with Hawaii the fruit is a native of southern Brazil .
10 . Clouds
Look outside your window – you may see a fractal cloud at any moment .
11 . Crystals
Both chemically - formed crystals and ice and frost crystals are breathtaking examples of fractals in nature .
12 . Mountain ranges

Both shorelines and mountain ranges are considered loosely fractal .
These particular examples are beautiful .
13 . Trees and Leaves
Images via timalbertson , Yale , enchanter
From the macro view of a leaf to the span of a tree ’s branches , fractals turn up frequently .
14 . Shorelines

This stunningly complex fractal shoreline is none other than the pan handle of Florida .
15 . Rivers and fjords
Images via Today is a good day
From the midwest of the United States to the icy fjords of Norway , fractals are often viewed by airline passengers – these particular travelers were savvy enough to snap photographs .
16 . Sea urchins and sea stars

Sea urchins are compact , almost artistic little creatures ; sea stars are more commonly referred to as starfish .
17 . Stalagmites and stalactites
By now you know that stalagmites shoot up from the ground while stalactites form overhead .
Amazing fractal configurations all .
The links at the beginning of this post are highly recommended as they are a great start to exploring even more wondrous natural and artificial fractals .
The latest Futurama movie , Bender 's Game , is released in a few days and as usual it 's already on BitTorrent .
However , Matt Groening has included a nice extra on the DVD - a pretty amusing parody on one of the classic anti-piracy messages .
Anyone who watched The Simpsons Movie will have noticed Bart in the intro chalking his famous blackboard with the words “ I will not illegally download this movie ” .
Matt Groening seems to appreciate the comedy anti-piracy message as his latest movie , ‘ Futurama : Bender ’s Game ‘ , also includes some mockery of file - sharers or , on closer inspection , possibly some encouragement .
Whatever the intention , it is pretty funny .
The movie , the third in the Futurama series and due for release in a few days time , has already leaked to BitTorrent .
This is nothing new , but hidden away in the DVD extras is a parody of the infamous movie industry anti-piracy ad , which was previously parodied by the IT Crowd .
Entitled ‘ Downloading Often Is Terrible ’ or D.O. I.T for short , the animated advert follows the familiar “ You would n’t steal … ” structure , but with more unusual content .
Whatever the ad suggests that Bender would n’t steal or do , is followed up by Bender doing just that , starting with “ You would n’t steal a spaceship ” , which of course , Bender would , along with lots of other amusing things .
Although Bender is stealing physical objects in his 2D animated world , lots of people disagree with the use of the word ‘ steal ’ to describe the act of copyright infringement .
Australian lawyer Brendan Scott certainly does n’t believe it .
When someone downloads movies or music illegally , they make a copy , he argues .
The original is still there , and legally speaking nothing is stolen .
Scott concludes : “ To use the infringement - as - stealing meme demonstrates something of a lack of respect for language and consequently a lack of respect for the people to whom you are speaking . ”
But maybe Bender himself provides the truth .
The copyright lobbies often paint the fight against piracy as a “ matter of life and death ” so it seems fitting to utilize the phrase to illustrate the chasm between stealing and copying .
Having watched the clip and noted the final stolen item produced from Bender ’s chest , I immediately thought about where that came from , the state of the gentleman in question , and where I could find him for a chat .
Because if anyone in the world knows the difference between copying and stealing , it ’s got to be him .
Or Lucy Liu ’s milliner .
Enjoy the clip .
If you go back 3 months on YouTube , it appears that even this parody got leaked ahead of time .
Cammed too , you could n’t make it up .

In light of the current economic situation , I 've come down to the City of London to the trading floor of GFI group .
I 've come here to find out what underlies the actions taking place here to determine our market .
Could human behaviour be playing a vital role in the state of our economy ?
To help me look into this is John Coates from the Judge Business School at Cambridge University , who 's here with me know .
Hello , John .
How do the markets really work ?
John -
Essentially what we 're doing in markets is buying and selling assets either by private companies or the government .
The job of traders is to buy and sell these securities and in deciding whether to buy and sell them they have to make an assessment of the return they 're gonna make on these assets over the life of holding them and the risk involved .
Meera -
You 've been looking into the physiology of traders and the City of London .
What have you been looking into ?
John -
We 've been following a hunch I had when I was working on Wall Street during the dot - com bubble .
I was struck by the fact that traders at the time were acting very different from the way they were acting before the bubble and after the bubble .
They were displaying classic symptoms of mania .
They were overconfident .
They had racing thought , diminished need for sleep and they were carrying themselves in such an odd way I began to suspect there was a chemical involved .
The second thing I noticed was that women were relatively unaffected by the frenzy surrounding the dot - com bubble .
During that time I was splitting my time between the trading desk at Rockefeller University on the Upper East side .
There I came across a very powerful model that 's been tested in a number of different animal species .
I thought this model may be applicable to the financial markets .
In this model that 's called the winner effect two male animals go into a competition .
Their testosterone levels rise in preparation for this competition .
The winner comes out of this competition with even higher levels of testosterone .
The loser comes out with lower levels .
The winner may go into the next round of competition with already elevated levels of testosterone .
This can give him an added advantage .
It has effects on muscles and the cardiovascular system but more importantly it affects his confidence and his appetite for risk .
He goes into this competition with a slight edge .
It 's what happens at the end - game of this model that 's really interesting .
As the testosterone levels build up in these male animals they become overconfident so , for example , they go out in the open too much .
They pick too many fights , they patrol areas that are too large and they neglect parenting duty .
They suffer an increased rate of predation .
That 's exactly what I was observing in traders during the dot - com bubble .
They take risks that are , quite frankly , stupid .
Meera -
How did you go about actually testing this in City traders ?
John -
I got access to the floor in the City and we took salivery steroids from a group of traders over a two week period to test that steroids were in fact responding to the money they were making and losing in the market and whether this , in turn , was affecting their trading performance .
Meera -
What did you find ?
John -
We found that the traders , if they had high testosterone in the morning relative the the median levels , they made a lot more money for the rest of the day than they did on the days when they had low testosterone .
Meera -
When most people think of testosterone they obviously associate it largely with males .
Does this then mean that females are relatively unaffected ?
John - Women have about 10 % of the testosterone that men do .
It 's entirely possible that they 're not subject to this kind of overconfidence .
Meera -
But you 're also looking into levels of cortisol , as well .
John -
That 's right .
In the current environment that may be the more interesting steroid .
When the market turns around it turns into a crash what can happen is that cortisol , which is a stress hormone , can become elevated in the bodies of traders .
Cortisol , if you 're exposed to it chronically at high levels for a long period of time , it can have a devastating effect on both the mind and the body .
In terms of affecting traders decisions what it can do is affect the memories you recall .
You tend to recall bad memories , negative precedents .
You tend to see risk where maybe there is none .
You become fearful , you feel anxiety .
I think that decreases a trader 's appetite for risk .
While testosterone is causing people to take too much risk cortisol is causing people to take too little risk in the crash .
Meera -
What do you think the current situation is now ?
Do you think there are going to be higher levels or cortisol in the traders at the moment ?
John -
It 's not only how far the market has fallen .
It 's how long it 's been falling .
These traders have been under stress for almost a year and a half now .
Their cortisol levels must be elevated .
I 'm sure there 's a very good chance it 's affecting their decisions .
Meera -
You were mentioning that long - term effects of cortisol will have long - lasting effects on their minds .
Is this something that companies should think about ?
John - I guess so , yeah .
It 's something the Bank of England should be thinking about .
Economics is built on the assumption that economic agents are rational , they respond to price signals .
If you increase the price of something by raising interest rates people will stop buying securities .
They do n't in a bubble .
On the flip side during a crash or a depression they lower interest rates and economic agents are supposed to respond to that by buying assets .
They look more attractive .
If these steroids are reaching such a level in our bodies that we become price - insensitive then monetary policy may no longer work and , in fact , that 's what we see .
Meera -
Do you think if the banks and the companies understood this physiology a bit more they could work together , say with neuroscientists , to try and get out of the economic situation that we 're in at the moment ?
John -
We 're in a bit of a mess at the moment .
Cortisol is a hormone that responds not just to loss or injury ( loss being in this case money ) it also responds more powerfully to situations of novelty , uncertainty and uncontrollability .
Within banks I think it 's extremely important , although very difficult to create , an environment that minimises the trader 's feeling of uncontrollability .
Managers think they have to be pro-active as they say in business speak to show that they 're doing something to improve the situation .
Usually what they 're doing is threatening to fire people .
That 's exactly the wrong thing you should be doing .
We need some positive shock to come into the system of the very sort they 're talking about now like the bail - out package passed in the US last week and been discussed this week in Britain and Europe to break this downward spiral of risk preferences .
( CNN ) --
In tests for teacher Tom Farber 's high school class , students can demonstrate their mastery of calculus and find out where to get braces or even a haircut .
Calculus teacher Tom Farber is selling ad space on tests to defray printing costs .
Squeezed by classroom budget cuts , the Rancho Bernardo High School teacher is selling ads on his exams to cover the costs of printing them .
" It raises money for the teachers and it's amusing for the kids , so it seems like a win-win , " said Luke Shaw , 18 , a student at the suburban San Diego , California , school .
Parents and administrators also praise Farber , 47 , for his creative classroom funding , but he does n't want it to become the norm .
" My intention is , [ selling ads ] is a stopgap measure , " said Farber .
" I do n't want to be doing this year after year . "
Instead , he says , government must do more to help educators provide what students need .
Farber started letting parents and local businesses sponsor tests this fall after learning budget cuts would limit his in - school printing allowance -- tracked by the school 's copy machines -- to $ 316 for the year .
The cost of printing quizzes and tests for his 167 students will easily be more than $ 500 , he said .
That meant Farber , whose courses prepare students for the Advanced Placement exam , would have to give fewer or shorter tests , or find money .
Farber , who says 90 percent of his students got a 5 -- the top score -- on AP exams last year , said skimping was n't an option .
" It has to be a certain quality , or they wo n't be ready , " he said .
So Farber , who says he'd never asked for money from parents in his 18 years of high school teaching , pitched the ad idea to parents at a September back - to - school night .
For checks made to the math department -- $ 10 a quiz , $ 20 a test or $ 30 for a final exam -- they could insert an inspirational quote -- their own or someone else 's -- or a business advertisement at the bottom of the first page .
Watch how teacher came up with ad idea »
Of the seven to run so far -- one per test or quiz -- five were quotes , and two were ads from local businesses connected to the parents or someone close .
" Brace yourself for a great semester !
Braces by Henry , Stephen P. Henry D.M.D. , " read one of the ads in small type at the bottom of a quiz 's first page .
Farber said orders took off after recent media reports .
He 's collected more than $ 300 , and he believes he 'll top $ 1,000 , with some ad buyers paying more than required .
All amounts beyond his shortfall will cover colleagues ' printing costs , he said .
Farber said students and parents have gotten a kick out of the sponsorships .
Student Scott Robison , 18 , said : " I liked it because all the teachers complain about budget cuts , and he did something about it .
It has n't hurt in any way . "
Luke Shaw 's father , Jay Shaw , said he wants to sponsor a test next semester .
And while Jay Shaw praised Farber 's idea , " It 's just sad it came to the point where he needs to do that , " he said .
Farber said he does n't want quiz ads " to become the standard . "
" What I 'm doing now is ... dealing with the economic situation and making sure kids get what they need , " Farber said .
" Teachers should n't have to scrounge for funding .
To me , this is what our government is for , to provide necessities , and that 's why we pay taxes . "
But California 's budget crisis has forced Farber 's school district , Poway Unified , to cut costs , district Superintendent Don Phillips said .
The California Federation of Teachers says the state cut more than $ 4 billion in education spending this year .
Phillips said that when the district sought to chop $ 11 million from its $ 265 million annual budget , it wanted to keep teachers but cut other areas .
Among the things to go was 30 percent to 40 percent of Poway schools ' materials spending -- including copying .
Phillips praised Farber 's ad idea as creative .
But he said district officials are weighing whether to set guidelines , especially for business ads .
Farber said he'd prefer to keep ads to local " mom- and - pop " operations .
He 's accepting one from hair salon Fantastic Sam's , noting that although it 's part of a chain , the store that 's buying the ad is locally owned .
Farber and Phillips said they do n't know of any Poway teachers wanting to replicate the ad idea , but they said educators there have long spent out - of - pocket for supplies .
Susan Carmon of the National Education Association said a 2003 study on the issue found U.S. teachers spent an average of $ 450 of their own money yearly for school resources .
" You can only imagine -- with tighter school budgets in almost every state this year -- that this number can only get higher , " said Carmon , the NEA 's associate director for teacher quality .
Fred Glass , the California Federation of Teachers ' communications director , said things could get worse for teachers in the state , with California considering $ 2.5 billion in mid-year education cuts .
Glass said he hopes Farber 's ad selling " will underscore for disinterested observers that this [ funding shortfall ] can't go on . "
Glass said he would n't like to see any classroom ads .
" The student needs not to be distracted by anything on the test .
This is not instructionally sound , " he said .
But he said he does n't blame Farber .
" This teacher should n't be put in this position , " Glass said .
To those who do n't like his idea , Farber suggests asking legislators to better fund education or writing a check to a school .
But he said most of the feedback has been positive .
" One person said , ' Too bad you 're not a bank , because you might qualify for $ 700 billion , ' " he said .
" I thought that was pretty clever . "

In a span of 252 days , the National Review lost two Buckleys  one to death , another to resignation  and an election .
Now , thanks to the coarsening effect of the Internet on political discourse , the magazine may have lost something else : its reputation as the cradle for conservative intellectuals and home for erudite and well - mannered debate prized by its founder , the late William F. Buckley Jr .
In the general conservative blogosphere and in The Corner , National Review ’s popular blog , the tenor of debate  particularly as it related to the fitness of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska to be vice president  devolved into open nastiness during the campaign season , laying bare debates among conservatives that in a pre-Internet age may have been kept behind closed doors .
National Review , as the most pedigreed voice of conservatives , has often been tainted  unfairly and by association , some argue  by the tone of blogs , reader comments and e-mail messages .
“ Bill was always very concerned about having a high - minded and thoughtful discourse , ” Rich Lowry , the magazine ’s editor , said .
“ If you read the magazine , that ’s what it was and that ’s what it is . ”

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Like to eat meat ?
Consider this unappetizing truth :
When you gulp down a nice juicy steak or hamburger , you are contributing to tumor - fueling inflammation in your body .
In fact , eating a diet rich in red meat has long been linked to a host of ills including an increased risk of several types of cancer .
But what is it about meat consumption that could impact cancer growth ?
Now scientists at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine , have found a mechanism that explains how eating red meat , as well as milk , could spur the growth of malignancies .
The new study , headed by Ajit Varki , M.D. , suggests that inflammation resulting from a molecule introduced through eating these foods could make cancer grow .
The research is set for upcoming publication in the Dr.
Varki , UC San Diego School of Medicine distinguished professor of medicine and cellular and molecular medicine and co-director of the UCSD Glycobiology Research and Training Center , and his research team studied a non -human glycan , or sugar molecule , known as N - glycolylneuraminic acid ( Neu5 Gc ) .
Although this molecule is not produced naturally in the human body , it 's incorporated into human tissues .
The body then develops antibodies against Neu5 Gc  and this immune response could potentially trigger a low - grade chronic inflammation , spurring the growth of cancer .
In a statement prepared for the media , Dr. Varki explained it has been recognized by scientists for some time that chronic inflammation can stimulate cancer progression .
"
We 've shown that tumor tissues contain much more Neu5 Gc than is usually found in normal human tissues .
We therefore surmised that Neu5 Gc must somehow benefit tumors , " Dr. Varki said in the press statement .
So the scientists came up with this hypothesis :
The fact that Neu5 Gc accumulates in human tumors despite circulating anti-Neu5 Gc antibodies suggests a low - grade , chronic inflammation has developed , and caused the tumor to grow .
To test this idea , the researchers worked with specially bred mice .
The animals lacked the Neu5 Gc molecule , just as humans do before they eat red meat and the molecule is absorbed into their bodies , and they had tumors .
Anti-Neu5 Gc antibodies were given to half of the mice .
In those animals , the antibodies induced inflammation and their cancers started growing faster .
In the control group comprised of mice that were not treated with antibodies , their tumor growth was far less aggressive .
Building on previous research that has shown that humans who take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( commonly known as NSAIDs ) have a reduced risk of cancer , the researchers tried giving NSAIDs to the mice with cancerous tumors fueled by anti-Neu5 Gc antibodies .
The result ?
The anti-inflammatory treatment blocked the effect of the Neu5 Gc antibodies and the tumors became smaller .
" Taken together , our data indicate that chronic inflammation results from interaction of Neu5 Gc accumulated in our bodies from eating red meat with the antibodies that circulate as an immune response to this non-human molecule  and this may contribute to cancer risk , " Varki said in the media statement .
For anyone interested in reducing inflammation through natural , non -drug methods , here are seven top strategies to incorporate into your lifestyle :
1 . Stop eating meat and dairy products .
2. Concentrate on a Mediterranean flavored style of eating with lots of fruits , vegetables , whole grains , olive oils and nuts .
Research has shown these foods lower inflammation levels .
3 .
Do n't smoke and avoid those who do  second hand smoke can contribute to inflammation .
4 .
Know your oils .
Avoid all inflammation - causing trans - fats , hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils as well as saturated animal fats .
Instead , add inflammation - fighting omega - 3 oils like flaxseed , canola and walnut oil to your diet .
5 . Lose weight if you need to .
Research has shown that a waist that measures over 40 inches in a man or over 35 inches in a woman is a sign of probable high inflammation .
6 .
Do n't skimp on sleep .
Previous studies have concluded less than six hours of sleep can result in inflammation .
7 . De-stress .
Try yoga , meditation , walking and other forms of exercise .
Staying continually stressed out means your body is releasing excess , inflammation - promoting stress hormones .
Schedule a minimum of 20 minutes a day to let your worries go .

Next month , Intel will show off its next - generation Classmate laptop , which includes a touch screen and new features that make it easier for students to use .
The new Convertible Classmate is a tablet PC , with a touch screen that swivels to make data input easier .
Intel will show prototypes of the laptop at the International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) to be held in Las Vegas between Jan. 8 and 11 .
Intel bills the Classmate as an educational laptop for kids in developing countries , but it will also be available in the general market .
The touch - screen interface makes software more interactive and easier for kids to use , Intel said .
The Classmate is a reference design created by Intel , but the laptops are actually shipped by PC makers throughout the world .
PC makers will discuss their plans to ship Convertible Classmate products at CES , an Intel spokeswoman said on Wednesday .
Laptops built by using the reference design will become available in early 2009 .
The new laptop has a clamshell design with an 8.9 - inch screen .
Input of data can be done either through a stylus or by touch .
There is an option to rest palms on the touch screen while inputting data .
The laptop has a number of other bells and whistles , including an accelerometer that changes the display ’s orientation horizontally or vertically depending on the laptop ’s position .
The Convertible Classmate will run on an Intel Atom processor and come loaded with either the Windows or Linux OS .
With the new Classmate , Intel is a step ahead of its prime competitor , the XO laptop from nonprofit One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) , which plans to offer a touch - screen interface in its XO - 2 laptop , due to ship in 2010 .
The XO - 2 will include a software - based , touch - sensitive keyboard and two touch - screen displays .
The laptop is also an upgrade from the current Classmate PC , which is widely known as Classmate 2 .
Classmate 2 is a no-frills laptop without a touch screen that can be used for basic applications such as surfing the Web and checking e-mail .
Priced at around $ 300 , Classmates do include many of the basic features found in laptops today , like USB ports and wireless networking capabilities .
In India , the Classmate laptop is available under the MiLeap brand from HCL starting at Rs. 17,000 ( US$ 350 ) .
Olidata sells Classmate PCs in Europe under the JumPC brand .
Computer Technology Link ( CTL ) sells the laptop under the 2go PC brand in the U.S. online and through retailers .
Intel has seen success with its Classmate PC .
Earlier this year it announced it would ship about 500,000 Classmates to basic - level education students through the Portuguese government for the current school year .

I do n’t claim that I know every little secret , but I tell you this : I get a lot of decent results with what I ’m doing so far .
You want some ideas from my side of the page ?
Here : take 40 of them .
And if you want , add to them in your own blog post ( pointing back to here ) .
Ready ?
The Basics
Brevity rules .
Can you say it briefly ?
Start at the main point , then work the story up .
( Make the main point in the first paragraph . )
Use small words .
You do n’t have to impress people .
You have to be clear .
Analogies help people understand things better .
So do stories .
You do n’t have to write complete sentences , even though your teacher taught you to do that .
But treat it sparingly .
Like this .
Like a condiment .
Keep paragraphs small , if possible .
We balk at large blocks of text .
Make your point from the reader ’s side of the fence .
Who is your audience ?
Depending on how you write , go back and see if you can cut out more .
Reduce .
Reduce .
Reduce .
Use the word you ’re thinking about , not a fancier , or more polite word .
Concepts and the Bigger Picture
Set up series of posts , even if you do n’t call them a series .
Make a post that brings up follow - on points from a previous post , and link back to that post to reinforce the original content .
Get your inspiration from reading .
# 1 source for my ideas comes from other blogs not in my space .
Not sure what to read that ’s NOT in your space ?
Alltop , my friend .
( see also ) .
Think strategically , if this is for business or a cause .
Ask yourself what you want your reader to do next .
Try to write from that point of view .
Theme - wise , writing very helpful things that people can use is way better than writing thoughtful things that make people think and just walk away .
You can have thoughtful but not helpful , but you ’re striving for helpful and thoughtful in the same piece .
Never write the me - too blog .
Look to be ahead of the wave and feeding backwards , not behind the wave and eating someone ’s wake .
Look for ways to think forward , but that tie to your business interests .
When I write about the future , I ’m also inviting someone to make that future with me .
Mix it up .
Keep an editorial calendar and note what kinds of posts you ’ve written lately .
Thought posts ?
Lists ?
Interviews ?
Make sure you ’re mixing up the type of post you ’ve written lately .
Consider the occasional dip into Google Trends to write a story that might draw new audience to your conversation .
Do n’t do this all the time , because the gimmick can wear off quick .
Again , think condiments , not meals .
If you do n’t have anything interesting to blog , skip a day .
Do n’t skip many days .
And never never never ( raise your hand and repeat this with me ) “ I ” ( state your name ) “ solemnly swear never never never never ever to post another ‘ I ’m sorry I have n’t blogged lately ’ posts ever again .
Ever . ”
Overdrive
Consider your audience but write from your passion .
Do n’t mince words .
If it ’s a “ pissing match , ” it ’s not a disagreement .
Ask questions .
Blogs are conversations starting and flowing .
Ask. Questions .
Link to people .
If you write about Steve Garfield , link to Steve Garfield .
It ’s not all about your blog .
Get out and comment on other people ’s blogs .
Often .
Leave a few ideas unfinished .
Ask for input .
It always improves a piece .
Blogs are great for that .
Use tags .
Lots of tags .
Make sure you claim your blog with Technorati , and submit it with Alltop .
Make sure your blog ’s URL is everywhere : in your email signature , in Facebook , in Flickr , in Twitter , in every outpost you can think about .
Do n’t email , DM , and otherwise push every blog post you write to other people .
Share the best ones .
Let the others be found on their own merits .
Always know why you ’re doing what you ’re doing .
Question yourself often .
Look for ways to improve the game .
Encore
Comment back to the people who have left comments .
Follow those people ’s links sometimes and go explore their blog .
Look for ways to empower the community you inspire .
If you have n’t found your community yet , keep looking , searching , and connecting .
Learn about Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ) and Search Engine Marketing ( SEM ) .
It ’s no longer okay not to know even the most basic things .
Find great Creative Commons photos and use them for your post ( with attribution ) .
Deconstruct what your favorite writers do , and try it your own way .
Occasionally , try something completely different .
Do n’t be afraid to fail .
Be afraid of not being interesting enough .
Write as if someone believes in you , because someone does .
( me ! )
And if that ’s not enough , here ’s my best advice about blogging .
What do you think ?
Any questions ?
Anything I left out ?

After the official release of KDE 4 last year , I took a close look at nascent projects that aimed to port the desktop environment to other operating systems .
These ports have matured significantly over the past twelve months and are beginning to approach the point where they are robust enough for general use .
The open source KDE desktop environment , which is one of the two most popular Linux desktop stacks , underwent a significant transformation during the transition to version 4 .
Many parts of the environment were written from scratch and large parts of the underlying development infrastructure were overhauled .
One of the major changes that accompanied this transition was the adoption of Qt 4 , the next major version of KDE 's underlying toolkit .
Qt licensing changes that coincided with the launch of Qt 4 made it possible for the KDE developers to port the desktop to Windows and Mac OS X .
The porting effort was also greatly simplified by KDE 's adoption of the CMake build system .
With the KDE 4.2 release right around the corner , it 's time to take another look at the KDE porting effort and see how the popular desktop environment performs on Windows .
We installed the KDE 4.2 release candidate on Windows XP and tested a wide range of KDE applications .
Installation
The KDE on Windows team provides a wizard - based Windows installer that automatically downloads and installs the desired components .
The user can choose which parts of the KDE stack are included in the installation by selecting application categories or by selecting specific packages .
The installer lets users choose from several different versions , including the latest stable release and the latest development release .
The application category list also allows users to install additional localization bundles so that the software can be used in their native language .
I included most of the application groups in my test installation , which added up to about 650 MB of disk space .
The complete install consists of numerous utilities , graphics editing software , development tools , multimedia programs , and the complete KOffice suite .
It 's an extremely expansive assortment of programs that cover a broad variety of tasks .
The installer sets up launchers for the applications on the system Start menu .
It does not , however , add an uninstaller entry to the Windows " Add or Remove Programs " list .
The KDE installation is pretty much self - contained , so it can still be uninstalled by deleting the directory in which it was installed , which defaults to C: Program FilesKDE .
Visual style and native platform integration
The Qt toolkit has support for using native widget styles on Windows and other platforms .
KDE on Windows automatically uses the native theming engine by default in order to increase visual integration with the rest of the Windows environment .
This works pretty well for simple applications , but some of the more sophisticated widgets look a bit awkward and out of place .
It 's sort of an uncanny valley effect .
Fortunately , you can configure the environment to use a different theme engine .
I generally felt most comfortable using KDE 's own Oxygen widget style .
The KDE configuration tool does not appear to be included in the Windows installation , so you have to manually edit the configuration file by hand .
Documentation that explains how to configure the style and other aspects of the environment are provided in the KDE on Windows installation instructions at the project 's wiki .
You can also configure KDE applications to use the KDE file dialogs instead of native Windows file dialogs .

Summary
If the Nov. 26 attacks in Mumbai were carried out by Islamist militants as it appears , the Indian government will have little choice , politically speaking , but to blame them on Pakistan .
That will in turn spark a crisis between the two nuclear rivals that will draw the United States into the fray .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Analysis
At this point the situation on the ground in Mumbai remains unclear following the militant attacks of Nov. 26 .
But in order to understand the geopolitical significance of what is going on , it is necessary to begin looking beyond this event at what will follow .
Though the situation is still in motion , the likely consequences of the attack are less murky .
We will begin by assuming that the attackers are Islamist militant groups operating in India , possibly with some level of outside support from Pakistan .
We can also see quite clearly that this was a carefully planned , well - executed attack .
Given this , the Indian government has two choices .
First , it can simply say that the perpetrators are a domestic group .
In that case , it will be held accountable for a failure of enormous proportions in security and law enforcement .
It will be charged with being unable to protect the public .
On the other hand , it can link the attack to an outside power : Pakistan .
In that case it can hold a nation - state responsible for the attack , and can use the crisis atmosphere to strengthen the government ’s internal position by invoking nationalism .
Politically this is a much preferable outcome for the Indian government , and so it is the most likely course of action .
This is not to say that there are no outside powers involved — simply that , regardless of the ground truth , the Indian government will claim there were .

Water allowed the Umatilla Basin to blossom , transforming a parched stretch of eastern Oregon into what one farmer calls the bread basket of Oregon .
Acres that once produced only dryland wheat flourished with irrigated beans , peas , corn , melons and potatoes after farmers sunk deep wells and tapped aquifers as far as 1,000 feet below ground .
But there was a cost , and the bill quickly followed the benefit .
Since the 1970s , water levels have dropped 500 feet in some parts of the basin 's aquifers .
And in an area that gets only 12 to 13inches of rain per year -- a third of what falls in the Portland area -- water is being used faster than nature can provide it .
Out of that conundrum comes a bold plan that supporters say may be copied worldwide in regions struggling with rising populations and sinking water supplies .
A coalition of farmers , engineers and state officials propose to divert billions of gallons from the Columbia River during the winter months and store it underground for use during bone - dry summers .
The method of recharging aquifers has been used on a smaller scale -- one of the basin 's farmers does the same thing on his land -- but the project would involve moving , storing and recovering up to 32 billion gallons of Columbia River water annually .
Preliminary engineering work shows there is " high potential " for storing massive amounts of water underground within the cracks and crevices of deep basalt formations that underlie the basin , the very areas drained by decades of heavy irrigation .
In a region where it 's estimated half the jobs are somehow connected to irrigated agriculture , the study is welcome news .
" I 'm getting a little more optimistic as we progress here , " farmer Chet Prior said .
The basin's farmers and the communities they support have a lot riding on the outcome .
Umatilla and Morrow counties are sparsely populated -- ranking 13th and 29th , respectively , among Oregon 's 36 counties -- but they are agricultural powerhouses .
In 2007 , Umatilla ranked third statewide in farm sales , with $ 358 million .
Morrow County was fifth , at $ 322 million .
Aquifers not refilling
But the farmers have long been aware of the problem their success was creating :
The aquifers could not recharge quickly enough to keep pace .
Carbon 14 age - dating -- indicating when the water was last exposed to Earth 's atmosphere -- showed some of the water that farmers were drawing had been underground 27,250 years .
The greatest water - level declines were in areas where irrigation was the heaviest .
The Oregon Water Resources Department gradually curtailed how much farmers could pump from some wells and ordered other wells shut down .
Umatilla Basin users now are allowed to draw only 30 percent of the groundwater allocated to them on paper under the state 's water rights permit system .
No other region of the state has such extensive water shortages .
" Over time , as the aquifers declined , the state has been shutting us off , " farmer Kent Madison said .
" They kept whittling away at us . "
Farmers in the area responded in part by investing in irrigation techniques the state Department of Agriculture says are the most technologically advanced and efficient in the world , such as laser - guided land - leveling to assure even application and low - pressure sprinklers .
But efficiency only gets you so far , and farmers have long eyed the Columbia as a source for more water .
Taking water during the summer when it 's needed for crops , however , runs up against a political and environmental roadblock :
The river flow produces electricity and supports endangered salmon and steelhead migrations .
But removing water during the winter , when the river runs high , may be a different story .
The question has always been how to store it .
Building reservoirs above ground was an expensive proposition .
Would use existing pipes
A group led by Hermiston engineer Fred Ziari proposed another way .
Largely using an existing infrastructure of irrigation pipes , pumps and wells , they envision drawing up to 100,000 acre feet of water annually from the river .
An acre - foot is enough water to cover an acre of land a foot deep ; 100,000 acre feet is about 32.5 billion gallons .
For perspective , the Portland Water Bureau produces about 38 billion gallons annually .
The water would be discharged into shallow , alluvial aquifers -- essentially sediment resting on top of the deeper , basalt aquifers .
After several months , researchers believe about 25 percent of the water would percolate to the Umatilla River , emerging in July and August to increase and cool its flow .
The remainder would be pumped out of the alluvial aquifers and into wells .
Two - way valves would allow the water to spread from the wells into the deep aquifers .
One of them , called the County Line aquifer , appears capable of storing up to 70,000 acre feet of water .
In summer , the water would be pumped back out for irrigation .
As much of the developing world struggles to provide water for booming populations , the project will be closely watched , said Ziari , the engineer .
" It 's a no - brainer "
The idea of recharging aquifers was n't new to farmers such as Madison .
He obtained a license to carry out a miniature version of the project in the mid-1990s after the state warned he would have to shut off one of his wells .
Diverting winter water from Butter Creek , he floods a 15 - acre field , percolating murky water through the soil , which also cleans it .
The water enters drain tiles buried 25 feet deep , gathering in a pool .
Madison then pumps it to a deep well .
" We 've been doing this for years , but this takes it to a bigger scale , " Madison said .
" To us , we know it 's a no - brainer , we know it works . "
Multiple details remain , including financing , water rights and forging agreements with farmers and irrigation districts .
Gov.
Ted Kulongoski's proposed budget contains $ 2.5 million for the next phase of the project .
Ziari said the total could range from $ 22 million to $ 100 million , depending on the scope .
A key environmental group offers some cautions , however .
Oregon appears to be embarking on a strategy of storing high winter river flows without considering the implications , said John DeVoe , executive director of Portland - based WaterWatch .
The flows scour gravel in the river bed , push back vegetation crowding the channel , flush migrating fish to the ocean and lure adult fish back to spawn in the spring , he said .
But , DeVoe said , " if it can be done without interfering with the health of the Columbia , we 're not going to stand in its way . "

Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September , the psychological impact of this crisis has been to produce a rapidly spreading fear .
Capitalism relies on confidence for continued spending .
When both of these dry up , there is a natural desire on the part of consumers , taxpayers , citizens to hear from a figure — such as Brown — who claims to know his stuff and have a concept of what might happen next .
If he says that he knows how to limit the coming pain , all the more reassuring .
But that does not necessarily make it true .
What we do
We fight for tribal peoples ’ survival .
We stop loggers , miners , and oil companies from destroying tribal lands , lives and livelihoods across the globe .
We lobby governments to recognise indigenous land rights .
We document and expose the atrocities committed against tribal people and take direct action to stop them .
We give tribal peoples a platform to speak to the world .
We ’ve had over 200 victories since 1969 , but our work is far from over and we need your help .
Engineers have constructed a solar array smaller than a dime out of 20 solar cells , each cell tinier than a quarter of this lowercase " o . "
The mini photoelectric device only generates seven volts of electricity .
But that could be enough to power the kind of microsensors military planners imagine will provide the soldier of the future with first - person - shooter - like battlefield intelligence .
That 's why the Army is a major sponsor of the project , which is described in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy .
Unlike conventional silicon solar cells , the new device is created from carbon - based , organic polymers .
The study 's authors argue the array could transform electronics , even though right now it is far less efficient than silicon cells .
" The world ’s next generation of microelectronics may be dominated by ' plastic electronics ' and
organic solar cells are expected to play an important role in these future technologies , " writes lead author , Xioamei Jiang .
The Army is leading the charge on microscale power production for one simple reason .
Energy — in the form of batteries — is expensive and heavy on the battlefield , so the armed forces have been pouring money into alternative - energy projects that could provide long - lasting , self - produced and cheap electricity .
One alt - energy startup founder noted earlier this year that soldiers can pack 30 pounds of batteries for a 24 - hour mission .
He estimates such a load of batteries , and the supply lines necessary to provide them , costs the military $ 57,000 per soldier per year .
Jiang began building the solar - power array in an effort to run a microscopic sensor known as a microelectromechanical system , which uses carbon nanotubes to sense dangerous chemicals .
The array can't fully power the system yet , but they anticipate that a future generation of the array could charge the detector , perhaps by next year .
The Army 's interest is broad .
They are looking into a wide variety of low - power sensors that monitor the soldier 's body and environment .
When integrated with other technologies , the technology could eventually provide real - time data about the soldier 's mind , body and military situation .
" You can start to imagine how power becomes a very , very important parameter to the soldier , " Barry Perlman , associate director for technology at the Army 's Communications
Electronics Research and Development Center at Fort Monmouth , New
Jersey , told Wired.com earlier this year .
" Every sensor needs power ... so we have quite a few people concerned with how to generate power . "

For several years the U.S. military has fought a covert war in Somalia , using gunships , drones and Special Forces to break up suspected terror networks
\– and enlisting Ethiopia 's aid in propping up a pro-U.S .
" transitional " government .
It 's a relatively unknown front in the " war on terror , " and one where the U.S. and its allies are losing ground , fast .
Two years ago , the U.S. military fought alongside Ethiopian troops in a lightning - fast armored assault deep into Somalia aimed at destroying the Islamic government , which the Pentagon suspected of harboring Al Qaeda operatives .
Today the Islamists are back , waging a brutal insurgency that has killed thousands of people and steadily gained ground against the occupying Ethiopians and their allies in the transitional government .
Last week , taking advantage of a power struggle inside the transitional government , the Islamists pushed to within five miles of
Mogadishu , previously an Ethiopian and government stronghold .
Just goes to show : the political front can be one of the most important in modern counter - insurgency campaigns .
The escalating fighting has all sorts of ramifications .
U.N. food convoys feeding half the country ( mostly with U.S. - donated food ) have been disrupted .
And efforts to create a Somali judiciary capable of prosecuting piracy cases have been sidelined .
While security in Iraq has improved by the day , Somalia and Afghanistan continue their slides into chaos , on Washington 's watch .

ATHENS , Ohio , Dec. 8 ( UPI ) -- U.S. scientists using computerized tomography scanning have found dinosaurs had much larger air cavities in their heads than had been thought .
Ohio University Professor Lawrence Witmer and research associate Ryan Ridgely examined skulls from two predators , Tyrannosaurus rex and Majungasaurus , as well as two ankylosaurian dinosaurs , Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus .
For comparison , the scientists said they also studied scans of crocodiles and ostriches , which are modern day relatives of dinosaurs , as well as humans .

The analysis of the predatory dinosaurs revealed large olfactory areas , an arching airway that went from the nostrils to the throat and many sinuses .
Overall , the scientists said , the amount of air space was much greater than the brain cavity .
Witmer and Ridgely also calculated the volume of the bone , air space , muscle and other soft tissues to make an accurate estimate of how much the heads weighed when the animals were alive .
They determined a fully fleshed - out T. rex head , for example , weighed more than 1,100 pounds .
Witmer suggests the air spaces helped lighten the load of the head , making it about 18 percent lighter than it would have been .
The research appeared in a recent issue of the journal The Anatomical Record .
It 's not just in finance that the inquests have begun .
What part have the business schools and business academics played in the implosion of the world 's banking system ?
That was the question posed in a letter to the Financial Times last week by Nottingham University Business School 's Professor Ken Starkey .
Hedge funds , private equity , investment banking , venture capital and consulting - the high priesthood of financial capitalism - were overwhelmingly MBAs ' preferred job destinations , he noted .
Now the schools needed to 'reflect on the role of the MBA and MBAs in the carnage of Wall Street ' and consider ' how management education has contributed to the mindset that has led to the excesses of the last two decades ' .
This is n't the first time that theory and theorists have been called into question .
Three years ago the London Business School 's late Sumantra Ghoshal caused a furore by writing that business schools did not need to do a lot more to prevent the emergence of future Enrons ; they just needed to stop doing a good deal of what they were doing already .
But the questioning takes on a fresh urgency as the crises grow bigger .
In this context , the issue is not just the implication of economics - dominated MBA courses in practices that are now seen to be unsustainable .
' There seems to be no sense of history , ' Starkey complains .
' How come we have n't learnt anything from Enron , the dotcoms and Long Term Capital Management ? '
Trapped until now in a stampede to emulate the American model , business schools elsewhere need to step back and see how they could , and should , frame the issues differently , he says .
The Holy Grail is not to turn them into professional institutes ( as two Harvard professors proposed in another FT article the same day ) but the more modest one of ' doing better social science ' .
They should move away from unquestioned US positivism and the dominance of neo-classical economics towards a broader perspective allowing insights from other areas , including history , literature and art .
Could it happen ?
Starkey is not the only one who senses an opportunity for the market to move in a new direction .
The ' elite ' business schools are doomed to remain locked in increasing competition for a ( presumably ) shrinking pool of apprentice masters of the universe .
But for others , says Professor James Fleck , dean of the Open University Business School , Europe 's largest , the time is ripe to go beyond the fake certainties of the Anglo - American version , with its emphasis on analytics and separate functions , to develop a more inclusive , less lopsidedly right - brain approach to management .
Most of the world is not well served by the structures or assumptions of financial capitalism .
If we could lift our eyes from the financial chaos , Fleck argues , we would see that the world is at the start of a huge technological upswing .
As a consequence , there is terrific , unsatisfied demand for people to manage this innovation in ways that benefit more than a tiny financial elite .
Management , in the sense of ' making a difference ' , could be the enabling technology of the 21st century .
Who better placed to undertake such a project , and rethink the intellectual underpinnings of capitalism , than European business schools ?
Many would welcome such a move .
At Leicester School of Management , Professor Martin Parker notes that , though long submerged under the ' there is no alternative ' discourse , an undercurrent of resistance to the market managerialism of the past 30 years has always subsisted - and not just in the public sector ( where , duly adapted , it has ironically been practised with terrifying thoroughness ) .
The surprising rage and venom hissing through the blogs commenting on a recent Economist leader about bankers ' pay show just how deep it runs in the private sector too .
Little of this surfaces in formal management research , however .
Analysing 2,300 articles published in prominent journals in 2003 and 2004 , Parker and two colleagues found business - school researchers overwhelmingly concentrating on narrow technical questions rather than the larger social and political issues - the environment , war , workers ' rights , the distribution of wealth - which business has signally failed to provide answers to .
While the piece , ( ' Speaking Out : The Responsibilities of Management Intellectuals ' ) , pre-dated the financial crash , in one sense it reinforces it - underlining that in terms of what academics actually publish , little seems to have changed since Enron , or even the dotcoms .
The underlying question , says Parker , is whether business schools can contribute to the solution rather than the problem .
One way of doing this , he suggests , would be to reformat themselves as ' Schools for Organising ' that can teach and learn from a multiplicity of different forms - ' and do not simply reproduce the ideology of people called managers ' .

The holiday parade featuring children from Our Community School in North Hills , Calif. , made Nikki Maxwell so nervous that she told her children she could n't ride on a float with them .
Ms. Maxwell , who had worked at the charter school as a grant writer before she was laid off in September , dreaded small talk with parents and faculty that would inevitably lead to the subject of her job search .
" Their eyes will dart and they will say , ' Ummm , have you found anything yet ? '
And I 'll say , ' No , not yet . '
And they 'll come up with some cockamamie idea about what I should do , and then I have to defend why I should n't do that .
It just gets very uncomfortable . "
One of the biggest strains for people who 've been laid off in recent months is explaining -- with Christmas music playing in the background -- what happened to the old job .
Bad layoff jokes , uneven gift exchanges and tense small talk with the in - laws are just a few of the social challenges facing the jobless .
For Ms. Maxwell , a 39 - year - old mother of three , disappointing her children ultimately seemed worse than an awkward social encounter , so she put on a jester 's hat emblazoned with the words , " Spread Joy , " and climbed aboard the " Grinch Who Stole Christmas " float .
She screamed with other revelers as the parade rolled down Chatsworth Street in Granada Hills .
" I discovered a certain amount of almost primal yelling , " she says .
在长期买碟的老板娘店里看到这部影片的时候，狠狠的嘲笑了一番影片上方的"
华语公路大片癫狂之作"，最后依然买了它回家，只是想看看华语公路片会带领我们前往何处。
影片一直被丢着，直到圣诞夜的时候在家才把它翻出来看，年末，还算适合的时机，如果是年末的最后一天，也许就更完美了。
这部影片被很多人骂得很惨，也同时被一些人捧得很高。公路片似乎永远都是这样，被喜欢它的人喜欢，被讨厌它的人唾弃。
公路片原本就注定是沉闷的。《公路之王》在没有一点剧情式的情节起伏，一个电影放映员，一个自杀未遂的男人，他们开着卡车从一个城市的影院到另一个城市影院，琐碎到如大便等的细节填满了近三个小时的黑白影片，却有着最接近纯粹的公路片色彩。
《 过界》也算是沉闷的，而且破碎。男女主角开着车，沿着原本是别人计划的旅途一路前行。中间一段很长很长的沉默，长得超出了我的预估。"不在沉默中爆发，就在沉默中死亡"，终究不能让世界都沉浸在死寂中，所以也只能选择爆发。
电影开头女主人公不断变换的角色，带着小说《搭车游戏》的味道，而2人多次并肩呆目伫立的镜头，更是让我有种对北野武电影的熟悉。
画面剪得很碎，单凭切断的画面去推断主人公的遭遇的人生，注定落空。就像真实的人生，我们永远都看不懂别人的人生，因为我们看到的，永远都是别人人生中支离破碎的片段，而亦，很少有人看得懂自己的人生。
以孤独疏离作注脚，为了寻找自我而发生的一场逃离，或是逃亡，一段旅程，除了杀人越货等那些被导演赋予了的极端表现形式，未必会有多少离奇的情节发生，而这也是真正的旅程。
这部影片象很多人批评的一样，的确有很重的汽车广告片嫌疑，而片中预定的目的地"伊犁"
还真的让我想起了伊利，虽然电影的商业性妥协是很难例外的，但个人觉得导演在这个方面处理得还算相当的不错，万晓利的歌声就是最好的证明。公路片的生命一半在音乐，而万晓利的歌声让《过界》充满力量，这是导演的功劳，不容质疑。
海子的诗中写道 " 我有三次受难：流浪，爱情，生存 " ，而《 过界 》 说的，刚好是一场关于流浪、爱情和生存的故事，不管这个故事叙述得完不完美，是否符合你的想象。
男女主人公牵着手在雪中伫立，他们终于在别人的旅程中到达了自己的终点，那是任何地方，任何地方都是他们的" 伊犁 " 。
而看过的人多少都会觉得片中堆砌和隐喻了太多原本就浅显的道理。其实，这些道理只有对真正悟了的人才是浅显的，就像我懂，也未必真的就悟了，就像那条荒漠的公路和漫天黄沙的雅丹，我也曾经去过，但也未曾找到心中的" 伊犁 " 。
驾驶着汽车，怀着破碎的梦，疾驰在荒漠的公路上，扬起漫天的风尘......
突然很想再写一篇，关于那些公路片。
---------------------华丽分割出一些闲言碎语---------------
因为恰好说到公路，想到有一些很旧（因为已经在脑子里存在了很久）的闲言碎语想要说说，这些跟这部影片完全没有关系，如果是为了看影评而来的朋友，可以忽略了。^_^
2007 年 8 月 6 日《 中国经济周刊》上有过统计，全世界收费公路共有 14 万公里，其中 10 万公里在中国，占全世界 70 % 。交通部规定 40 公里设一收费站，而有些地方政府规定，高等级公路每 20 公里甚至更短路程就可设 1 个收费站。
公共产品形成垄断，一定会对公共利益带来伤害，收费公路同样如此，虽然这种伤害的真实程度似乎无法确认，也无法评估。
因此，有识之士早就指出，遍布全国设卡收费的高价公路，已成为影响我国经济协调发展的最大" 拦路虎 " 。
突然觉得，这真的是个值得关注的问题。

But I really like the argument that we are not oppressed under statism 's various forms because here in the U.S. we can speak our minds without fear of being thrown into a concentration camp or investigated or blacklisted -- well , most of the time .
At any rate , the FBI has n't yet shown up at my door with truncheons , and this website has n't been shut down or officially censored Chinese - style , and the writings of Samuel E. Konkin III and Lysander Spooner have n't been burnt publicly .
Even the most timid critics of the Keynesian wizards who 've ruined our economy with their economic magickry ( next time try using more eye of newt ! ) get invited on Sunday morning talk shows .
Sometimes people even take them seriously .
So maybe there is some merit to that argument .
If we accept that the State is built on little more than legal violence , power - grabs , exploitation and manipulation , then why do n't they and their authorities simply wipe its critics out ?
Why do modern social - democratic States in the West tolerate radicals even as we ceaselessly preach the truth about them ?
Hint : it has nothing to do with their commitment to democracy , " good government , " and human rights .
During the Republican primaries , Ron Paul was often a ( arguably ) libertarian voice of reason in a field filled with chickenhawks , economic engineers , wannabe theocrats , and other candidates very hostile to liberty .
Both Rudy Giuliani and debate moderator Chris Wallace insinuated that he was an Al - Qaeda appeaser for his criticism of belligerent foreign policy , John McCain snickered like The Joker as he argued against keeping troops in Iraq for a century , and Fred Thompson sneered at him when he argued against the predatory policies of the Federal Reserve .
Even if , like me , you held serious misgivings about his candidacy , do not think this hostility insignificant -- it was aimed squarely at those libertarian positions we defend .
Spineless conservative and moderate warmongers insisted that they were the reasonable ones pitted against a threatening extremist .
Likewise , within the status quo , radicals serve the sociological function of sacrificial animals .
Libertarian , anti-war , and pro-market concepts often are falsely blamed for all sorts of crises .
The Great Depression has been blamed on so - called " free - market " policies ( non-existent then and now ) , the current financial crisis is being blamed on " deregulation " , the rise of dictators like Saddam Hussein and genocides in Darfur are blamed on " isolationism " , social problems are blamed on our " selfish " libertine attitudes , and the continued spread of poverty is blamed on our " callousness " as well as the free market .
Apparently the only thing that can solve or prevent problems is centralizing more power and wealth in the hands of a small elite political and economic class , however " democratic " they may run things .
Never mind that it 's the resulting cronyism , warmongering , and social engineering that causes so many of these problems in the first place -- by the statist logic , anyone who resists their methods resists solving problems .
These straw - men arguments , misrepresentation , and historical revisionism all function like a frantic defense mechanism .
Without it , the failures and crimes of the ruling class would become much harder for people to ignore , like a festering boil on one 's face .
Ca n't have that , can we ?
If you 've grown up all your life in that system , it 's all you know , everything is framed within its own terms , and your very worldly success depends on playing the system , then the alternatives can look rather scary .
Alternatives to statism and corporatism would be more humane , equitable , peaceful , and beneficial to everyone , but no matter how hard we present it that way , the system will always have a need to hide from its failings and contradictions in order to keep itself going .
Why would its heralds critically examine their own failings and contradictions when they can just demonize someone else and project their failings onto him ?
Here lies one reason we are useful to the establishment -- as a scapegoat .
The other reason is that it might pose a problem if the ruling class was more nakedly aggressive in eliminating its radical critics .
States based merely on the reckless and open - faced exercise of raw violence , without enough effort made to justify it ideologically , invite political one - upmanship , violent upheavals , and instability .
This constant " live by the sword " approach greatly increases the costs of building and maintaining power .
Hence Cambodia under Pol Pot , Uganda under Idi Amin , Somalia under Siad Barre , and present - day Burma are all modern examples of such brutal and relatively short - lived states .
In contrast , the USSR , Iraq under Hussein , Nazi Germany , Cuba under Castro , and Spain under Franco endured because these states had an ideological basis ( Communism , pan-Arabism , cult of personality ) that could be used to gain popular support and thus earn political and social durability .
More sophisticated states like the US , France , Britain , Japan , Venezuela , and so on , have an even clearer ideological basis -- democracy , social contract , Bolivarism , " Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity " -- and are generally more careful about how they go about their sordid business .
To paraphrase Stephan Molyneux , empires grant a certain amount of liberty to their citizens in order to make us more happy , efficient , and productive , and thus encourage more economic growth -- which they then exploit through taxation to expand their own profit and power .
Likewise , it is more efficient to maintain a fa'ade of liberal democracy over other methods .
If the people find it favorable , it makes it so much easier for the ruling class to claim and defend a sense of legitimacy -- and thus maintain power and privilege .
Were this the good ol ' CCCP , Ron Paul 's brains would 've been used to paint some prison cell wall red .
But in the US at least , such actions on a widespread scale would clash with the official ideology -- the Constitution , due process , government 's job to protect people 's rights and liberties , blah blah blah .
It was more efficient in the long run to keep Dr. Paul in the Republican debates ( or allow Jesse Ventura to condemn the two main parties , or allow Ralph Nader to chastise corporate power , or allow the Mises Institute to preach against insane economic policies , or allow any number of activists and journalists to spread the truth about war , occupation and corporate - fascism ) .
If pressed to the fire , the ruling class can just shrug and say : " See ?
We allow dissent .
We 're not tyrants , this is a free democracy !
These crazy libertarians and anarchists have it all wrong .
We 're the good guys , really !
We 're really looking out for you ! "
( Pssst ... is that bailout ready yet ?
How 's that oil war going ?
Gay marriage is still banned ?
Great ! )
Sadly , the US government has indeed gotten away with violating many people 's civil rights here while committing war crimes and economic terrorism around the world .
All that 's necessary is to tweak the ideology a little bit -- see the Cold War , the War on Terror , and the Unitary Executive theory for details .
So fear not the gallows , ye radicals .
As much as they probably fear us and would love to be rid of us , the statist ruling class ( at least in the West ) needs radicals , and not because they truly believe in tolerance and liberal democratic values for their own sake .
Instead : ( 1 ) they need ideological scapegoats to project blame for their hubris , and ( 2 ) tolerating our presence , weathering our harsh criticisms peacefully , and even engaging us allows them an air of legitimacy as far as their current " democratic " system is concerned .
In the end , it boils down to image .
It 's hard to defend an arrogant and openly ravenous monster , but a smooth - talking serial rapist might manage to dupe you into thinking he 's God 's gift .
Who do you think would win the battle of public opinion ?
The ruling class understands this ; they ain't stupid .
But neither are you .
Congratulations , MidSouth Bancorp !
Youâre the 200th participant in the bailout !
MidSouth , a Louisiana bank , will " win " a $ 20 million investment on favorable terms .
So far , 205 financial institutions have gotten a piece of TARP , the $ 700 billion bailout bill , according to ProPublicaâs running tally .
Money has been doled out across the country , from Hawaii to Maine to Puerto Rico .
As always , you can see where the banks are on our map .
The biggest participant so far is Citigroup ( $ 45 billion ) , the smallest Saigon National Bank , a regional bank in California ( $ 1.2 million ) .
The average investment is $ 1.2 billion , but the vast majority of banks have gotten much less â the median investment is $ 50 million .
$ 246.95 billion total has been tagged for investment .
Yesterday , the Congressional panel charged with overseeing the Treasury Departmentâs program held its first regional hearing .
Las Vegas residents didnât show much love for the bailout , the Los Angeles Times reports , and the chair of the panel proclaimed " there is little evidence of what effect these billions of dollars are having on us . "
Only one bank headquartered in Nevada has received Treasury funds : Western Alliance .
The bank , based in Las Vegas , got $ 140 million last month .
Of course , national banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America got billions .
" It is just not helping at all , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) said at the hearing .
Representing ordinal numbers in the computer and elsewhere
Lately I have been reading Andreas Abel 's paper " A semantic analysis of structural recursion " , because it was a referred to by David Turner 's 2004 paper on total functional programming .
The Turner paper is a must - read .
It 's about functional programming in languages where every program is guaranteed to terminate .
This is more useful than it sounds at first .
Turner 's initial point is that the presence of ⊥ values in languages like Haskell spoils one 's ability to reason from the program specification .
His basic example is simple : loop :: Integer ->
Integer loop x = 1 + loop x
Taking the function definition as an equation , we subtract ( loop x ) from both sides and get 0 = 1 which is wrong .
The problem is that while subtracting ( loop x ) from both sides is valid reasoning over the integers , it 's not valid over the Haskell Integer type , because Integer contains a ⊥ value for which that law does n't hold : 1 ≠ 0 , but 1 + ⊥ = 0 + ⊥.
Before you can use reasoning as simple and as familiar as subtracting an expression from both sides , you first have to prove that the value of the expression you 're subtracting is not ⊥ .
By banishing nonterminating functions , one also banishes ⊥ values , and familiar mathematical reasoning is rescued .
You also avoid a lot of confusing language design issues .
The whole question of strictness vanishes , because strictness is solely a matter of what a function does when its argument is ⊥ , and now there is no ⊥ .
Lazy evaluation and strict evaluation come to the same thing .
You do n't have to wonder whether the logical - or operator is strict in its first argument , or its second argument , or both , or neither , because it comes to the same thing regardless .
The drawback , of course , is that if you do this , your language is no longer Turing - complete .
But that turns out to be less of a problem in practice than one would expect .
The paper was so interesting that I am following up several of its precursor papers , including Abel 's paper , about which the Turner paper says " The problem of writing a decision procedure to recognise structural recursion in a typed lambda calculus with case - expressions and recursive , sum and product types is solved in the thesis of Andreas Abel . "
And indeed it is .
But none of that is what I was planning to discuss .
Rather , Abel introduces a representation for ordinal numbers that I had n't thought much about before .
I will work up to the ordinals via an intermediate example .
Abel introduces a type Nat of natural numbers : Nat = 1 ⊕ Nat
The " 1 " here is not the number 1 , but rather a base type that contains only one element , like Haskell 's ( ) type or ML 's unit type .
For concreteness , I 'll write the single value of this type as ' • ' .
The ⊕ operator is the disjoint sum operator for types .
The elements of the type S ⊕ T have one of two forms .
They are either left ( s ) where s∈S or right ( t ) where t∈T .
So 1⊕1 is a type with exactly two values : left ( • ) and right ( • ) .
The values of Nat are therefore left ( • ) , and right ( n ) for any element n of Nat.
So left ( • ) , right ( left ( • ) ) , right ( right ( left ( • ) ) ) , and so on .
One can get a more familiar notation by defining : 0 = left ( • ) Succ( n ) = right (n )
And then one just considers 3 to be an abbreviation for Succ ( Succ( Succ ( 0 ) ) ) as usual .
( In this explanation , I omitted some technical details about recursive types . )
So much for the natural numbers .
Abel then defines a type of ordinal numbers , as : Ord = ( 1 ⊕ Ord ) ⊕ ( Nat → Ord )
In this scheme , an ordinal is either left ( left ( • ) ) , which represents 0 , or left ( right ( n ) ) , which represents the successor of the ordinal n , or right ( f ) , which represents the limit ordinal of the range of the function f , whose type is Nat → Ord .
We can define abbreviations : Zero = left ( left ( • ) ) Succ( n ) = left ( right ( n ) ) Lim( f ) = right ( f ) So 0 = Zero , 1 = Succ ( 0 ) , 2 = Succ ( 1 ) , and so on .
If we define a function id which maps Nat into Ord in the obvious way : id :: Nat →
Ord id 0 = Zero id ( n + 1 ) = Succ ( id n ) then ω = Lim ( id ) .
Then we easily get ω+1 = Succ( ω ) , etc. , and the limit of this function is 2 ω : plusomega :: Nat → Ord plusomega 0 = Lim( id ) plusomega ( n + 1 ) = Succ( plusomega n)
We can define an addition function on ordinals : + :: Ord → Ord →
Ord ord +
Zero = ord ord + Succ( n ) = Succ ( ord + n ) ord + Lim( f ) = Lim ( λx. ord + f( x ) )
This gets us another way to make 2 ω : 2 ω = Lim ( λx. id ( x ) + ω ) .
Then this function multiplies a Nat by ω : timesomega :: Nat →
Ord timesomega 0 = Zero timesomega ( n + 1 ) = ω + ( timesomega n ) and Lim ( timesomega ) is ω 2 .
We can go on like this .
But here 's what puzzled me .
The ordinals are really , really big .
Much too big to be a set in most set theories .
And even the countable ordinals are really , really big .
We often think we have a handle on uncountable sets , because our canonical example is the real numbers , and real numbers are just decimal numbers , which seem simple enough .
But the set of countable ordinals is full of weird monsters , enough to convince me that uncountable sets are much harder than most people suppose .
So when I saw that Abel wanted to define an arbitrary ordinals as a limit of a countable sequence of ordinals , I was puzzled .
Can you really get every ordinal as the limit of a countable sequence of ordinals ?
What about Ω , the first uncountable ordinal ?
Well , maybe .
I can't think of any reason why not .
But it still does n't seem right .
It is a very weird sequence , and one that you cannot write down .
Because suppose you had a notation for all the ordinals that you would need .
But because it is a notation , the set of things it can denote is countable , and so a fortiori the limit of all the ordinals that it can denote is a countable ordinal , not Ω .
And it 's all very well to say that the sequence starts out ( 0 , ω , 2 ω , ω 2 , ωω , ε 0 , ε 1 , ε ε 0 , ... ) , or whatever , but the beginning of the sequence is totally unimportant ; what is important is the end , and we have no way to write the end or to even comprehend what it looks like .
So my question to set theory experts : is every limit ordinal the least upper bound of some countable sequence of ordinals ?
I hate uncountable sets , and I have a fantasy that in the mathematics of the 23rd Century , uncountable sets will be looked back upon as a philosophical confusion of earlier times , like Zeno 's paradox , or the luminiferous aether .
[ Addendum 20081106 : Not every limit ordinal is the least upper bound of some countable sequence of ( countable ) ordinals , and my guess that Ω is not was correct , but the proof is so simple that I was quite embarrassed to have missed it .
More details here . ] [ Addendum 20160716 :
In the 8 years since I wrote this article , the link to Turner 's paper at Middlesex has expired .
Fortunately , Miëtek Bak has taken it upon himself to create an archive containing this paper and a number of papers on related topics .

Hacking the Hot Wheels Radar Gun
The Hot Wheels Radar Gun is a real radar gun currently ( Feb 2007 ) available from Walmart and other retailers for about $ 30 ( USD ) .
It is a real radar gun , operating at 10.525 GHz capable of clocking cars , people , pets , and toys .
Here and here are sites that discuss the product .
The Austech site goes into great depth on how the device works .
But before you can play with it , you 've got to get the thing open !
Here are some pictures of me taking the thing apart .
There are about a dozen screws that are covered with plastic that need to be removed .
You will first have to drill out the plastic to get to these screws if you want to completely disassemble the gun .
Note :
There is a better way of doing this here if all you want to do is gain access to the signal wires .
WARNING !
Clicking on the thumbnails will bring you to a large photo , which while under a megabyte each , might clog your internet tube .

Another view down the waveguide
Once you have it open , you can play with the TX / RX module .
It has three wires coming out of it : black , red , and white .
Black is ground and red is Vcc , at 4.5 volts .
It seems to run okay off anything near 4.5 volts ; I simply use a 5 volt regulator and a diode to drop 0.6 volts before for supplying the module .
The module constantly transmits 10.525GHz when supplied power .
The module then receives the reflected signal and mixes it with the transmit oscillator .
The result is a sinusoid with a frequency equal to the diffrence in frequency of the transmitted and received signal .
( Also the sum of the two frequencies is present , but the 21.050 GHz signal is filtered or otherwise lost in the module . )
If the tranmitted signal is bounced off something that is moving , then you can find the speed of the object by measuring the frequency of the output .
Thats how the radar gun works in the first place .
Read up on " Doppler Radar " to learn more .
The easiest way to disassemble the gun
After purchasing my second radar gun , I realized that you could gain access to the waveguide signals very easily !
You do n't need to drill out all the screws covers and pry everything apart .
All you need to do is drill out or pop off the covers to the screws on the displace face plate .
These are very easy to get out .
With a little bit of prying and bending , you can pop the black plastic piece that the LCD is mounted to .
You will then find the control board and wires free for use .
Just unsolder the wires and you 're good to go !
There are three wires to the wave guide , bundled together .
There are four wires from the trigger switch , one set a normally - open switch and the other pair normally closed switch .
Finally , there are the two wires from the battery pack in the handle .
You even have some space to fit a small PCB of your own design back into the gun , for a slick hack .
The end of the gun removed A detail of the wires with voltage dropping diodes soldered A detail of a single tranistor amplifier board A hack well done
Using the module in your own circuits
There is interest in making a radar unit useful to robots , mainly for detecting objects at distance .
The raw signal out of the module is sort of weak , however .
Here is my current breadboard circuit :
[ Radar Module ] ------------[ Amplifier ]-----------[Comparator]----------------o
( less than ( less than ( 5 v squarewave ) 20 mVpp ) 2 Vpp )
The amplifier is a simple common - emitter single - transistor amplifier using a 2N2222 .
It is biased with a 100 k ohm potentiometer and coupled to the radar module with a 10 uF capacitor .
It produces about 100 V/V of gain .
The comparator is a LM339 .
I 'm currently trying to find a proper amount of hysteresis .
With too little , it will produce some nasty toggling on transistions .
With too much , I the circuit is n't sensitive enough .
Problems with this circuit include : ( 1 ) getting the hysteresis right and ( 2 ) the inherant filtering when using capacative coupling .
If I had any single - supply opamps , I 'd use those to do the amplification and then send it straight to a microprocessor with an ADC to do simple digital signal processing .
Since the maximum frequency we are interested in is only about 100 Hz , this should work great .
What I 'd like to have is something like this , either with analog or digital processing :
[ Radar Module ] ------[ Amplifier ]---+---[ Comparator ]------[ Frequency Counter ]------[ Velocity Calculator ] | +---[ Power / Peak detector ]----[ Distance Calculator ]
Analog front end of control board
I decided that I needed to figure out how the orignal circuit handled the amplification of the output of the waveguide , so I traced out the circuit on the control board .
The output of the waveguide is AC coupled by a 10uF capacitor into a low - pass filter with a gain of 280 V/V .
It is then coupled with a 47uF capacitor to a low - pass filter with a gaine of about 6 V/V .
It is then capacitivly coupled with a 3.3uF capacitor to the first analog to digital converter pin on the microprocessor which is biased at about 12 % of the analog supply voltage .
Caveats :
There are details not shown here , such as several voltage regulators ( the board has three total ) that keep the analog and digital sides clean .
I do n't know what opamp is in use , but it matches the pinout of the one shown ( OPA2132 ) .
I also do n't know the frequency response of the two low pass filters because the surface mounted capacitors used are unmarked .
Another way of using the gun
While poking around Wikipedia , I stumbled upon the idea of using chirps for radar systems .
Generally its used in pulse radar systems .
Since the radar module mixes the TX and the RX for me , I can't measure the incoming RF very easily .
But if I transmit a chirp ( a short burst of RF that changes frequency during the pulse at a known rate ) , then when the received signal comes back and mixes with it , I will observe a frequency related to the time of flight .
The transmitted signal begins at t0 , and gradually reaches some peak frequency .
After flying out into the world , being reflected off an object , and returning , the received signal shows up at t1 .
The output of the mixer is the difference of these two signals , and remains constant between t1 and t2 .
Eventually , the locally generated signal peaks , and the difference goes to zero as the received signals " catches up " to it at t3 .
So why go through all this ?
We because what the graph does n't show is the relative time in which these events occur .
The difference in t0 and t1 is the tiem of flight , which is related to the speed of light .
For military and aircraft radar , this is n't terribly short , because you might be measuring a distance of thousands and thousands of meters .
But the radar gun is neither powerful enough to put that much energy in the air , nor sensitive enough to detect the reflection .
We are measuring much less distance : less than 100 feet .
So the times of flight we will be seeing are very short .
This time difference is too short to measure easily .
( It is for this same reason why we cannont just send a pulse of RF and wait for its return . )
So we cannot measure the time of flight directly .
But notice that if we were to change the frequency slowly , we could increase the time between t1 and t2 .
As that time period grows long enough , it comes into the scope of what we can measure with microcontrollers and other cheap electronics .
Since the rate of the frequency change of the chirp is controlled by the transmitter , we can make the detection period as long as we need to make it .
Great , so how do we change the frequency ?
Good question !
The radar gun 's transmit oscillator is a single transistor sort of deal .
I 'm hopeing that changing the supply voltage will alter the capacitance of the transistor ( due to the Early affect , assuming its a BJT ) enough to change the operating frequency .
If its a MOSFET , I 'm not sure what to do .
There is a tuning screw on the back of the resonant cavity , which I could possibly articulate with a servo .
Perhaps removing the screw all together , and putting a unthreaded rod attached to a speaker or peizo element would allow me to modulate the operating frequency .
The Trouble with Chirples
I tried using chirps , to no success .
I think this was because I was not looking for the correct resultant frequency because I misunderstood the relationship between the time - of - flight and the rate of chirp frequency change .
You can see in this picture that the difference in frequency between the transmit chirp and the received chirp is very small .
This is because the chirp has n't had enough time to seperate in frequency .
If the chirp ramps up very quicklyso that there is more frequency difference between the two signals , it starts to work against our goal of having a relatively long period in which to detect the presence of the frequency difference .
So now I need to make sure that I sweep fast enough that whatever resultant frequency is made is of high enough frequency to rise above the noise due to doppler effects and can actually complete a reasonable amount of cycles before the chirp hits its peak frequency .
This is actually a second problem : I need to be able to have the chirp go through a large range of frequencies so that its ramping period can last as long as possible .
It only takes a radio signal 10 nanoseconds to travel 3 meters .
Since ours has to go round trip , thats 20 nanoseconds of time for our chirp to develop a good frequency difference .
If the chirp changes frequency by 1MHz every 10ns , then a our resultant frequency would be 2MHz .
At a distance of 30 meters , this would be a 10MHz .
Considering that the oscillator is running at 10.5GHz , this is probably realistic .
In fact , I might actually be changing the chirp frequency at much steeper slopes , and I 'll need to be looking for frequencies in the 100MHz range .
It is also interesting to compare this gun with how amateur radio operators work with systems in the 10GHz frequency range .
Spectral Output
I was contacted by a Kelly R. about using a PC as a spectrometer to investigate the properties of the output of the radar gun .
I 'd finally got some nice opamps to use , and so I rigged up a proper amplifier with a variable gain of 1 V/V to 100 V/ V .
I then sent this to the sound card line - in input .
The above was generated using DL4YHF 's Spectrum Lab , an excellent peice of software I highly recommend for any audio frequency spectrometry .
That image is taken with the software set at a very low setting , to simulate the output from a microprocessor implimented FFT .
I assure you that it is capable of much higher resolution .
The spectrogram scrolls from top to bottom , so I will start at the bottom .
The regularly spaced spikes at the bottom are me swinging my leg back and forth at about a distance of 6 feet from the radar gun .
The large spike towards the middle is me moving towards the radar gun ( to capture the image ) .
The very ' bright ' streak right on top of that is my arm moving to the mouse in front of the gun .
Finally , boring part at the very top is what the radar gun output looks like when nothing is moving .
I noticed that if I moved into and then back out of the beam of the gun , I could reliably detect my presence .
Also , if I moved the gun to point at objects much closer than the background , I could see a definite spike in the output .
Both of these occurances make sense because the gun measures relative speed between the gun and the target .
Thus , by sweeping it across an object which stands out from the background , you trick the gun into thinking something has moved suddenly very close , and then suddenly very far away .
I think these are promising results for a useful scanning device .
The next step is to build a panning head to keep the gun sweeping at a constant and known velocity .
Repurposing the LCD
The control module of the radar gun contains the analog amplifier ( shown above ) and an Atmel Atmega88 clocked at 20MHz .
Luckily for us , the makers brought out the standard 6 pin ISP header to the back of the board .
To program the module yourself , all you need to do is to solder a header to these pads , connect a 6 volt battery pack , and jumper the switch connection .
In this picture you can see the six pin header in the lower center of the board and the two pin header without jumper on the lower right of the board .
The chip is " locked " , so you cannot read the original code .
But by erasing the chip , you clear the memory and reset the lock fuses , making it normally programable .
Once programmed , you can make use of the three switches and the LCD as you see fit .
To control the LCD , you need to generate the correct waveforms .
Its not much fun to figure them out , but I was able to do it using the information provided in a few application notes from various manufacturers .
Just Google for " driving multiplexed LCD from microcontroller " and look for the app notes AN563 from Microchip , AN016202-0404 from Zilog , and the especially AN8000.13 from Semtech .
Here is some sample code to drive the lcd module .
It should compile with GCC on any platform .

Sorry for inconvenience :/
William Kristol , the conservative columnist , and The New York Times have quietly ended their relationship after little more than a year , the newspaper said on Monday .
A single sentence printed below Mr. Kristol ’s weekly column in the Monday issue broke the news : “ This is William Kristol ’s last column . ”
His column itself made no reference to his departure , and the paper did not release a statement .
Also Monday , The Washington Post announced that it had hired Mr. Kristol to write a monthly column and contribute to its opinion blog , PostPartisan .

Have you made a resolution to exercise your mental muscles this year ?
Then please join us for the 2009 Mathematics Game .
Here are the rules :
Use the digits in the year 2009 and the operations + , - , x , ÷ , sqrt ( square root ) , ^ ( raise to a power ) , and ! ( factorial ) — along with parentheses , brackets , or other grouping symbols — to write expressions for the counting numbers 1 through 100 .
All four digits must be used in each expression .
Only the digits 2 , 0 , 0 , 9 may be used .
The decimal point may be used , as in .9 , .02 , etc .
Multi - digit numbers such as 29 or 902 may be used , but preference is given to solutions that avoid them .
By definition : .
[ See Dr. Math ’s Why does 0 factorial equal 1 ? ]
For this game we will accept : .
[ See the Dr. Math FAQ 0 to the 0 power . ]
How Does It Work ?
Use the comments section below to post a running list of the numbers you have been able to calculate .
You may also share relatively cryptic tips and hints , but be warned :
Some teachers use this puzzle as a classroom assignment , and there will always be students looking for people to do their work for them .
Do not post your solutions .
I will delete them .
I know of no authoritative list of numbers that can be made with each year ’s digits , so we will rely on our collective wisdom to decide when the game is done .
We had a lively discussion the last two years .
I ’m looking forward to the fun !
Clarifying the Rules
Unary negatives are allowed .
That is , you may use a “ - ” sign to create a negative number .
This is particularly helpful if you are trying to keep the digits in order , using the 2 first and the 9 last .
The only digits that can be used to build 2 - or - more - digit numerals or decimals are the standard base - 10 digits 2 , 0 , 0 , 9 .
“ 0 ! ” is not a digit , so it cannot used to create a base - 10 numeral .
The decimal point is not an operation that can be applied to other mathematical expressions : “ .0 ! ” does not make sense .
No exponent may be used except that which is made from the digits 2 , 0 , 0 , 9 .
You may not use a square function , but you may use “ ^2 . ”
You may not use a cube function , but you may use “ ^( 2+0 ! ) . ”
You may not use a reciprocal function , but you may use “ ^( - 0 ! ) . ”
Also , you have to “ hit ” each number from 1 to 100 exactly — no rounding off or truncating decimals allowed .
You may not use the integer function .
For more hints , check out this comment from the 2008 game .
Keeping Track
As the game results are reported below , I will keep a running tally of confirmed results ( that is , numbers reported by two or more players ) here :
Percent solved = 90 % .
Wow !
Numbers that remain unsolved =
52 , 67-68 , 74 , 76-78 , 86 , 97-98 .
Depending on how busy life gets , the tally may lag a few days behind the results posted in the comments , so be sure to scroll down and read the latest news .
And if you would like to join me in the “ extended edition ” game …
Still looking for an expression that does NOT use multi - digit numbers :
57 , 84-85 , 87-89 , and 91-95 .
57 , 84-85 , 87-89 , and 91-95 .
Found a way to keep the digits in order : ( 62 % )
1-36 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 44-46 , 48 , 50 , 54 , 57 , 60 , 62-64 , 66 , 69 , 71-73 , 75 , 80-81 , 90 , 96 , 99-100 .

Minoxidil Warning September 2005
Minoxidil is the ingredient in popular hair growth formulas such as Rogaine .
It is the active ingredient which can revitalize hair follicles and promote the re-grown of hair in a percentage of balding men and women .
As cat exhibitors , we routinely use human shampoos and conditioners to maximize the presentation of our show cats ... and while many human hair care products are perfectly safe to use on cats , Minoxidil is NOT one of them !
Minoxidil Is Poisonous To Cats !
Since 2001 , six cases involving minoxidil exposure in cats were reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center ( APCC ) .
These included cases of intentional applications to areas on the animals ' bodies that had lost fur , as well as accidental exposures via licking or walking through the solution .
Of these cases , four of the cats died , while two fully recovered after prompt and aggressive veterinary treatment .
Very small amounts of Minoxidil can result serious problems or death Symptoms of Minoxidil Toxicity Lethargy
Severe drop in blood pressure
Accumulation of fluid in the lungs
Damage to the heart muscle , which can result in cardiac failure and death .
Lethargy and a drop in blood pressure typically develop within about 12 hours
~
Cardiac problems generally occur three to four days following the exposure
unless treatment is sought quickly
Cats may be especially sensitive to the adverse affects of Minoxidil because they lack a specific enzyme necessary for breaking this drug down in their bodies .
Prevention Never apply minoxidil products to your cat
Human application of Minoxidil should occur in a room that is not accessible to cats
Do not allow cats to lick treated areas
Clean up any spills thoroughly and promptly .
If Exposed If you suspect that your cat has come into contact with a minoxidil - containing preparation , immediately contact your veterinarian or the APCC 's 24 - hour emergency hotline at ( 888 ) 426-4435 .

So much is being spoken about the events on Chile - 1973 .
Most of them put the blame of the " coup " on CIA and U.S. - Pinochet was nothing more than an US proxy .
But the truth is a little complicated .
This text recovers the real nature of that military intervention , and makes clear that all the movement had its roots on Chilean soil and in defending her Constitution .
--------------------------------------------------------
The Truth About the Chilean Revolution
by José Piñera
( updated march 15th , 2000 )
It is true that Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile in 1970 by means of a democratic election ( although with only 36.6 % of the vote ) .
Nevertheless , it is equally true that his government lost its democratic character by repeatedly violating the Constitution .
The Economist said it clearly at the time : " The temporary death of democracy in Chile will be regrettable , but the blame lies clearly with Dr. Allende and those of his followers who persistently overrode the Constitution " ( September 15 , 1973 ) .
In effect , President Allende became a tyrant when he broke his solemn oath to respect the Constitution and the Chilean laws .
There are numerous evidences to that effect ( including a clear statement of the Supreme Court ) , but the most important one -- and widely unknown outside of Chile -- is the momentous Agreement of 23 August 1973 of the Chamber of Deputies ( the Lower House of the Chilean Congress ) , which I have translated and posted as " The Declaration of Breakdown of Chilean Democracy " .
In this Agreement , it is presented a list of the legal and constitutional violations of President Allende 's government , and it is agreed to " make representations " of this " grave breach of the legal and constitutional order of the Republic " to , among other authorities , " the Armed Forces " .
At the same time it agrees to " make representations to them that , by virtue of their function , of their oath to remain faithful to the Constitution and the law , ... it is up to them to put immediate end to all the situations referred to above , which infringe the Constitution and the law " .
So , since no feasible mechanism existed in the Chilean Constitution to remove a President who had lost his democratic nature , the House of Deputies , in a two third vote that included all the representatives of the Christian Democratic Party ( the party of former President Eduardo Frei Montalva ) , made " representations " to the Armed Forces that it was up to them to " put immediate end " to these constitutional violations .
It must be agreed that this was , in fact , an unequivocal call to remove by force the President who had initiated the use of force with the purpose of imposing a communist dictatorship .
The Armed Forces , led by the person who was then the Commander in Chief of the Army , General Augusto Pinochet , and claiming to be following the Agreement of the House of Deputies , removed Allende ( who committed suicide - My note : it is changed .
Read here ) and took power eighteen days later , on 11 September 1973 , vowing to restore democratic rule once the circumstances allowed it .
Therefore , the origin of the Pinochet government is that of any revolutionary one , in which only the use of force was left in order to remove a tyrant .
And , as Benjamin Franklin , one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence of the United States , once said , " rebellion against a tyrant is obedience to God " .
When a President elected by a third of the population is removed , and especially if his government has fomented the creation of armed militias as Allende 's indeed did ( see P. Johnson and J. Wheelan ) , it is inevitable that a state of " civil war " should ensue .
In some countries conflicts of this nature have produced hundreds of thousands of victims .
For example , the Spanish civil war brought around one million deaths .
Even the United States civil war , also the product of a Constitution which was not clear concerning whether the right for a state to opt out of the Union existed or not , resulted , more than a century ago now , in 650,000 deaths ( more than the total of the fallen in all U.S. wars of the 20th century ) .
Lamenting each one of the victims , Chileans and foreigners , who fell in Chile , and condemning each one of the abuses which both sides committed in the embryonic civil war which lasted for years , it is important to point out that the Chilean revolution produced a minimal number of deaths when compared to any historic standard .
Even the Report of the Commission which President Aylwin 's government , antagonistic to President Pinochet 's , set up ( the so - called " Rettig Report " ) , concluded that in the 17 year period around 2,000 people died .
As in any revolutionary period , there were excessive restrictions on individual rights during President Pinochet 's government and I denounced them at the time ( see " What Jose Piñera said about democracy and human rights during the military government ? " ) .
For which reason , I can affirm with the same independence that the deaths out of combat were not a systematic policy of the state during those years , but violations of the law carried by the intelligence services in their fight against terrorism .
The guilty should have the full rigor of the relevant laws applied to them , and that is exactly why , at this present time , the General who was head of the DINA ( National Intelligence Service ) when these violations were committed is in prison serving a seven year sentence .
In addition to the historic economic transformation carried out by the free market economists , the achievement which meant avoiding a war with Argentina , and the voluntary transition to a democratic government , the truth demands recognition that former President Pinochet led a legitimate rebellion against tyranny and that the origin of Chile 's civil war -- and its victims -- lies with former President Allende and his marxist Socialist party .
At the beginning of the computer era the system designers came from the world of hardware and it is noticeable .
In hardware there are many working elements that can operate in parallel and most times at different rates of operation .
This requires hi degree of accuracy in system timing .
Chip designers count the number of transistors between two elements to make sure that the Operation Flow is maintained .
The Assembly language defines a set of primitive / native operations .
The programming process and software design using Assembly is in direct correspondence with the execution flow .
If you want the flow to break then you use the Jump operation explicitly .
This is because Assembly was originally designed by hardware developers and was written to accommodate the hardware .
The C language is a procedural language .
It was originally created by Assembly programmers ( as ' B ' ) .
We can still see Assembly type of thinking operations built in the language , for example :
++ is INC
-- is DEC
[ A ] ? [ B ] : [ C ] is equal to :
[ A ] ;// do operation [ A ]
JZ ;// if true go to [ B ]
[ C ] ;// else do [ C ]
JMP ;// go to end
[ B ]
When you are used to working with Assembly you get used to thinking in " test " – " do this if so " – " do this if not " .
C programmers hardly ever use this .
The C language is a procedural language .
It helps us group together sets of operations and also releases us from the need to use Jumps or Go To-s , which can be very simple to track execution flow if you use it correctly but can be easily abused into what was coined as " Spaghetti Code " because of all the lines you need to draw when you try to track the execution flow of an application that was designed incorrectly .
Next evolution , came the language of C++ which is Object Oriented in design .
This allows the separation of code modules into discrete software units called a class .
Object Oriented programming allows multiple teams of developers to work on the same project very easily .
Object Oriented languages can really help the developer manage the code .
The problems that came with Object Oriented programming is that these languages are really designed to help the developer manage the code …
Now it is almost impossible to follow the execution flow .
When you want to know what happened in your application when the error message popped up you have to go over all the objects and all the classes that the execution flow went through and many times execution flow travels between several member functions before leaving to another object .
Following the execution flow today is almost impossible .
Many times I have seen ' Pure ' Object Oriented design producing a code that is a collection of many three - line functions that call each other .
Every button click in the application travels through ten or more small functions .
You can no longer follow the execution flow by reading the code .
This brings two major problems that we face today .
The first problem is that it is no longer possible to detect execution flow bugs with a simple code review .
Going over an Assembly code it is very easy to detect simple bugs such as down - casting , potential overflows etc .
Reading an object oriented code you can't see the big picture and it is often impossible to review all the small functions that call the one function that you modified .
The second problem with this model is the " Not my fault " syndrome .
" I only called a member of another object and it returned FALSE .
Do n’t ask me why " .
This is how you get an error that says " Problem with saving the document .
Reason is ' 0x8000745 – unknown ' ,
What would you like to do ? "
What do YOU think I should do ?!
The programmer got this return value from some object that he is not familiar with and has no idea what this value means so he just pushes that to the higher level .
The last level that you can propagate to is the user , and so my mother keeps facing these interesting decisions when she is trying to save a picture .
Object Oriented Modeling was invented to help developers manage the code but had no regard for execution flow .
Up till now we used to use step - by - step debugging to see the execution flow .
This is no longer relevant when we plan on having multiple threads going over our code .
You single step one thread and another completes 5000 loops in the background .
If you have multiple threads going over the same function they might all stop on the same breakpoint and you have no way of telling which is which effectively .
Following execution flow today is a terrible problem .
This is the first in a collection of articles that will introduce a new model called the Operation View Model with motivation for using it .
This model can define any element in the computer world and it is the next step in software evolution .
Next article will demonstrate how operating systems follow an evolution pattern that is similar to the ones described here .
Regular , platinum and gold Visa cards are displayed in New York March 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Imagine running the world ’s largest credit card network , and not having your own plastic .
That ’s what happened to Visa Inc Chief Executive Joseph Saunders .
He spoke Thursday morning at a Goldman Sachs financial services conference in New York , and had come from San Francisco , Visa ’s headquarters .
Unfortunately , his credit cards did n’t make the trip .
“ I ’m supposed to start off , and say that I ’m very happy to be here , and I guess I am .
But it ’s 4:15 in the morning as far as I ’m concerned , and I lost my wallet on the way here , ” Saunders said .
“ It ’s rather embarrassing when somebody steals my credit cards . ”
The comment prompted laughter .
Saunders began his presentation at 7:15 a.m EST .
Saunders did not elaborate .
Visa did not immediately return a call seeking further comment .

Failed yet another job interview ?
Unable to meet the right man or woman ?
Do n't blame your parents .
Or society .
The source of your suffering is your blood type .
The idea that blood type defines our personality , temperament and ability to mingle is routinely dismissed as nonsense , but that has not stopped four books on the subject from occupying Japan 's top 10 bestseller list for the past year .
Instruction Manual for People with Type B Blood and follow - up titles - which offer life - changing tips on everything from career moves to romance for types A , O and AB - have together sold 5 m copies so far this year , the book 's distributor Tohan said yesterday .
Mainly bought by twenty - and thirtysomething women , the books reflect Japan 's obsession with blood typology .
Blood types are cited as a factor in any thing from a colleague 's quick temper to an inability to secure a coveted job or the affections of a prospective lover .
Blood typology has filled countless pages and a large chunk of television airtime since journalist Masahiko Nomi wrote the first of 30 hugely popular books on the subject in the early 1970s .
Daytime TV shows offer " blood horoscopes " , while on sale are all manner of items supposedly tailored to each of the four blood groups , anything from chewing gum to condoms to bath salts - a relaxing , blue concoction for the sensitive type A .
Companies have been known to appoint employees to jobs based on their blood type , while dating agencies rank this genetic nugget alongside education and salary in recommending a male suitor .
Blood type - mania has a darker side .
It has been blamed for bullying among kindergarten children , denying jobs to otherwise ideal candidates and ending happy relationships , all because of an imagined haematic mismatch .
About 90 % of Japanese know their blood type , often before they know how to tie their shoelaces .
About 40 % are type A , 30 % are O , 20 % are B and 10 % are AB .
Some experts explain blood typology 's central place in the Japanese psyche by pointing to the rough similarity between the distribution of blood types and social classes in feudal Japan : the strong - willed samurai ( O ) and mild - mannered farmers ( A ) , and smaller numbers of sensitive artisans ( AB ) and earthy tradesmen ( B ) .
But Tatsuya Sato , an associate professor of psychology at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto , dismissed the blood type - as - personality theory as " superstition " .
" Even though psychologists and scientists have denied the relationship between blood type and personality , many Japanese are still naive about the connection , " he told the Guardian .
" The name of the bestselling book is instructive , as it's touted as an instruction manual .
Many Japanese adults have lost their knowledge of self , so they need books to tell them how to behave , " says Sato .
From A to AB
Type A Reserved and prone to worry , sensitive perfectionists such as Britney Spears and Adolf Hitler .
Type O Decisive , self - confident , curious , and ideal for sport , including Elvis Presley and the Queen .
Type B Cheerful caring , flamboyant free - thinkers such as Jack Nicholson .
Type AB High - maintenance , distant , suited to arts , such as Mao Zedong .

Sarah Jane Smith is stuck in 1951 , and everything seems lost ... until she spots a familiar blue box , in this clip from the latest Sarah Jane Adventures .
I could n't help getting my hopes up , even though the Police Box looked slightly off ... but at least Sarah Jane learned once again that she can't rely on anyone else to save the universe ... other than her small army of kids , that is .
Spoilers ahead .
The latest SJA two parter , " Temptation Of Sarah Jane , " was just as much of a weak copy of the Doctor Who episode " Father 's Day " as we 'd all expected .
Instead of Rose saving her dad from a car accident , it was Sarah Jane saving both her parents from a car accident .
And unlike Rose , who was a newbie time traveler dropped in the deep end , Sarah Jane knew just what she was doing and did it anyway .
As usual , though , the chemistry between the main cast members elevated the material quite a bit .
I love Clyde figuring out he 's stuck in an evil alternate present and dealing with it , and Rani showing up in the past and saying , " Hello , ethnic person in 1951 . "
Ha .
I have to admit , though , I 'm not liking season two quite as much as season one — it 's just not feeling quite as much fun this time around , and Sarah Jane is n't getting to be quite as awesome .
Still , next week 's reunion with the Brigadier looks like it 'll be everything we could hope for .

Capt Watson said the Steve Irwin was now in pursuit of the Yushin Maru 2 .
" They have ceased whaling operations and they are now running from the Sea Shepherd crew , " Capt Watson told AAP .
" If we can keep it on the run or shut down there 's no whaling . "
He called on the federal government to order the whalers to stop the hunt .
" The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is officially calling on Australian Environment Minister Peter Garrett and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith to order the Japanese fleet to comply with the orders of the Australian Federal Court and to cease and desist from killing whales in Australian waters , " he said in the statement .
During Saturday 's encounter , Steve Irwin crew members attempted to throw rotten butter bombs at the Japanese vessel from a small boat , but blizzard conditions forced them back .
" The winds were up to 45 to 50 knots and the waves got big and there were extremely hazardous conditions , so we called the boat back from doing that , " Capt Watson said .
Capt Watson said his crew also planned to throw methylcellulose - a substance used as a gelling agent and a laxative - at the Japanese vessels .
" I call it an organic , non -toxic biodegradable form of chemical warfare , " Capt Watson said .
Capt Watson said the Steve Irwin had entered the Australian Antarctic Economic Exclusion Zone four days ago , but had not expected to encounter the Japanese fleet for another month .
He said the earliest his crew had found the Japanese fleet on previous expeditions was Christmas Day , 2005 .
" Usually it 's not until the end of January that we find them , so we 're quite happy that we found them this early , " he said .
" I think this will have a significant impact on their quota and on their profits . "
He remained scathing of the federal government 's call for calm in the situation .
A joint statement from Foreign Minister Stephen Smith and Environment Minister Peter Garret was made on the matter earlier this month .
" We call upon all parties to exercise restraint and to ensure that safety at sea is the highest priority , " the statement read .
Capt Watson said the government was playing " silly games " .
" We have Australian citizens on board here who are quite ready to inform the Japanese that they are in contempt of an Australian Federal Court order , and this is really something the government should be doing instead of playing silly little games in Tokyo , which is n't going to get anywhere , " he said .
" I think he ( Stephen Smith ) should condemn the fact that whales are being killed here illegally . "
" All of this talk about diplomacy is n't saving any whales . "
Capt Watson expects to remain at sea until March .

Remote searches of suspects ' computers could become a mainstay of cybercrime investigations under a new EU strategy announced last week .
The EU Council of Ministers also agreed closer cooperation between law enforcement agencies across Europe , including joint investigation teams .
The five - year plan devised by the ministers also includes more information exchange on best practices , criminal trends and the like between law enforcement agencies and the private sector , and more cyber patrols .
The financial impact of cybercrime remains a bit of a mystery , not helped by the lack of well - organised reporting structures in Europe .
As a short - term fix the EU has earmarked € 300,000 for Europol to establish a clearing house ( or perhaps desk , given the small sums involved ) for crimes committed on the internet , such as the distribution of images of child abuse .
The EU cites computer viruses , spam , ID theft and child pornography as its main concerns .
" Images of sexually abused children available online quadrupled in the last five years and half of all internet crime involves the production , distribution and sale of child pornography , " a declaration from the meeting states .
Many of the measures agreed by the Council of Ministers continue with existing policies in areas such as closer European coordinating and cooperation in the fight against cybercrime .
The increased use of remote searches stands out as a new , and controversial , direction in policy .
In practical terms , remote searches would involve planting law enforcement Trojans on suspects ' PCs .
Police in Germany are most enthusiastic about pushing this tactic , the sort of approach even Vic Mackey from The Shield might baulk at , despite its many potential drawbacks , highlighted by El Reg on numerous occasions .
For starters , infecting the PC of a target of an investigation is hit and miss .
Malware is not a precision weapon , and that raises the possibility that samples of the malware might fall into the hands of cybercrooks .
Even if a target does get infected there 's a good chance any security software they 've installed will detect the malware .
Any security vendor who agreed to turn a blind eye to state - sanctioned Trojans would risk compromising their reputation , as amply illustrated by the Magic Lantern controversy in the US a few years back .
Then there are the civil liberties implications of the approach and questions about whether evidence obtained using the tactic is admissable in court .
Despite all these problems the idea of a law enforcement Trojan continues to gain traction and could become mainstream within five years , if EU ministers get their way . ®
Carter has become an unofficial advisor to Hamas .
He reported that he advised Mashaal on the price for the release of kidnapped soldier Shalit .
Former United States President Jimmy Carter reported that he advised Syrian - based Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal on what price to demand from Israel for the release of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit , who was abducted more than two years ago .
He said that Hamas is " relatively satisfied with the status quo . "
Carter 's visit to Lebanon and Syria earlier this month follows a trip to to Damascus several months ago in the face of American policy against establishing direct contact with the outlawed terrorist organization .
Carter wrote on his website that he spoke with Mashaal about " formulas for prisoner exchange to obtain the release of Corporal Shalit , " who has since been promoted to sergeant .
However , he probably is not aware of the promotion because the International Red Cross has not succeeded in convincing Hamas to honor the Geneva Convention and allow its officials to visit him .
The Red Cross also has rejected Israeli citizen 's demands that it stop visiting terrorists in Israeli jails until Shalit is seen and confirmed to be alive and in good health .
Shalit probably is not aware of the promotion because the International Red Cross has not succeeded in convincing Hamas to honor the Geneva Convention and allow its officials to visit him .
Carter also stated that Hamas , " like the Syrians , [ is ] relatively satisfied with the status quo and [ is ] putting all their eggs in Obama 's basket . "
He added , " We had to caution them about expecting too much of an immediate change in U.S. Middle East policy . "
His visit to Lebanon , where he offered to help monitor upcoming elections , was met with fierce opposition by the widely respected Investors Business Daily , which referred to Carter as " our worst ex-president " who is a " confidant of thugs and terrorists everywhere . "
Hizbullah is running in the elections in an attempt to increase its representation in the parliament .
" Is he going as a monitor or a cheerleader for terror ? " the business daily asked .
The Hubble Space Telescope recently caught this shot of Jupiter 's moon Ganymede just before it ducked behind the giant planet .
The largest moon in our solar system , Ganymede is an icy rock even bigger than Mercury .
It 's a gorgeous shot , but the image also reveals important information about Jupiter 's atmosphere .
As Ganymede passes behind the gas giant , light from the planet bounces off the moon , carrying with it clues about the chemicals that make up the haze above the Jovian clouds .
Also visible in the image is the Arizona - sized impact crater Tros on the moon 's surface , with bright streaks of material blasted around it .
Scientists think a saltwater ocean lies nearly 125 miles under the moon 's surface , sandwiched between layers of ice .
Even farther down , a liquid iron core is thought to exist , powering the only magnetic field around a moon in the solar system .
Ganymede circles around Jupiter approximately every seven days in an orbit tilted nearly head - on to Earth .

Teacher binds two black 7th graders in ' slavery lesson '
Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday December 7 , 2008

An attempt to make history more interesting turned ugly when a white , seventh grade teacher in White Plains , New York used black students to enliven a discussion about slavery .
The social studies teacher bound the hands and feet of two black girls -- only one of whom volunteered -- and had them crawl under a desk to illustrate the conditions on slave ships .
The incident sparked outrage among parents , local residents and the local chapter of the NAACP .
" I thought she was insane , " said Christine Shand , the mother of one of the girls .
" I mean , in this day and age , you do n't do stuff like that .
There 's other ways to demonstrate slavery . "
The teacher , Eileen Bernstein , has apologized for her actions at Haverstraw Middle School , where she continues to work .
Shand asked that Bernstein be removed from the class because her daughter is afraid to return to school , but school district officials have made no comment about what , if any , disciplinary actions are being taken against Bernstein .
Wilbur Aldridge , the regional NAACP director , met with Bernstein on Thursday .
" There 's nothing wrong with a lesson on slavery .
It was that particular choice of a demonstration that put it into a category of the bizarre , " he said .
" I do n't care what color , no one should be put in the position of having their hands and feet bound . "
After the meeting , Aldridge said he was disappointed that Bernstein was n't more remorseful .
" She said she apologized for causing any problems for the child , but she was not apologizing for using that simulation during the class , " Aldridge said .
Tuna may follow cod to become the second major Atlantic fish species to collapse after European leaders were today accused of driving through new catch quotas far above the levels recommended by scientists .
The international environment campaign group WWF renewed its call for a consumer boycott of Atlantic bluefin tuna - a staple of Japanese sashimi - after countries involved in its trade ignored their own scientific advice , despite a collapse in the fish populations .
WWF also accused the European commission ( EC ) of leading the pressure for higher quotas by using threats over trade to " bully " developing nations into switching sides from a rival proposal to stick to the scientists ' recommendation and ban all fishing during the spawning season in May and June .
Sue Liebermann , head of species at WWF International , warned that the mistakes which led to the collaspe of Atlantic cod – and led the UN 's food arm to warn that seven out of 10 of all marine species are depleted - were being repeated .
" Bluefin is a symbol of what we 're doing to the oceans , species by species , " she said .
Xavier Pastor , executive director in Europe for marine conservation group Oceana , said : " They [ the EC countries ] gave in to the fishing industry 's short - term economic interests .
With this decision , we can only wait for the disappearance of bluefin tuna . "
The EC did not want to comment on accusations of bullying .
But , it said , because it was " mandated " by member states , it had " pushed for " a package of measures which included the higher quota , a shortening of the fishing season from six to two months and tougher rules to stop illegal catches .
" A [ quota ] is not enough in itself to protect fish stocks ; a reduced [ quota ] accompanied by a shorter season and increased control is the solution to preserving this resource , " said Nathalie Charbonneau , spokeswoman for the EC fisheries and maritime affairs department .
Scientists at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( Iccat ) warned in 2006 that bluefish tuna numbers in the east Atlantic and Mediterranean had dropped to one - fifth of their levels in the mid-1970s , and massive illegal fishing was leading to annual catches as high as 50,000 tonnes .
Their report warned that " a collapse in the near future is a possibility " .
It called for the legal quota to be more than halved from 32,000 to 15,000 tonnes and for a ban on all fishing in the spawning period during May and June .
Yesterday , Iccat member nations , led by the EC and several north African countries , voted to cut the quota to 22,000 tonnes - defeating a rival notion to stick to the scientists ' advice led by the US , Canada and Norway .
WWF said it would now ask the international body the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( Cites ) to list Atlantic bluefin as an " appendix 1 " species , which would put a ban on international trade and switch off the lucrative market in Japan where most of the fish are sold .
A previous attempt to get Cites to take action in the 1990s was defeated when Iccat pledged to take its own measures to protect the bluefin , said Sergi Tudela , head of WWF 's Mediterranean fisheries programme .
" Sixteen years later it 's clear to the world that Iccat has failed , now it 's time to go very serious with CITES , " said Tudela .

June 2000 - December 2008
A more detailed list of servers is given here .
Though prophecy rarely lends itself to empirical verification , one exception might be an observation of St. Vincent de Paul ’s , writing about the year 1640 .
This was one of the grimmest periods of European history , the most desperate days of the Thirty Years ’
War .
In those awful days , Vincent noted that Jesus promised that his Church would last until the end of time , but he never mentioned Europe .
The Church of the future , Vincent said , would be the Church of South America , of Africa , of China and Japan .
Although we might argue about the inclusion of Japan in that list , St. Vincent ’s basic point remains sound and prophetic .
Christianity , a religion that was born in Africa and Asia , has in our lifetimes decided to go home .
Our traditional concept of the Christian world as a predominantly white and Euro - American world — of western Christianity , in fact — is no longer the norm .
Christianity should enjoy a worldwide boom in the coming decades , but the vast majority of believers will be neither white nor European nor Euro - American .
According to the statistical tables produced by the respected Center for the Study of Global Christianity , some 2.1 billion Christians were alive in 2005 , about one - third of the planetary population .
The largest single bloc , some 531 million people , is still to be found in Europe .
Latin America , though , is already close behind with 511 million , Africa has 389 million , and 344 million Asians profess Christianity .
North America claims about 226 million believers .
Now , we need not accept these figures in precise detail , and I personally believe that the Asian figures are too high .
Even so , a large share of the Christian world is already located in Africa , Asia , and Latin America .
Just as striking are the long - term trends .
The number of African Christians is growing at around 2.36 percent annually , which would lead us to project a doubling of the continent ’s Christian population in less than thirty years .
If we extrapolate these figures to the year 2025 , the southern predominance becomes still more marked .
Assuming no great gains or losses through conversion , then there would be around 2.6 billion Christians , of whom 595 million would live in Africa , 623 million in Latin America , and 498 million in Asia .
Europe , with 513 million , would have slipped to third place .
Africa and Latin America would thus be in competition for the title of most Christian continent .
By 2050 , Christianity will be chiefly the religion of Africa and the African diaspora .
By then , there will be about three billion Christians in the world , and the proportion of those who will be white and non-Latino will be between one - fifth and one - sixth the total .
If we project the largest Christian populations by 2050 , the United States will still be at the head of the list , followed by Brazil , Mexico , the Philippines , Nigeria , the Congo , Ethiopia , and China .
And even in the United States , many of the Christians will be of Hispanic , Asian , and African origin .
By that point , one - third of all Americans will have Latino or Asian roots — roots that will be overwhelmingly Christian .
This does not include those Americans of African origin , people who are either African Americans or of more recent African stock .
Some figures cry out for special notice .
Look , for instance , at the story of Christian growth in Africa .
In 1900 , Africa had 10 million Christians representing about 10 percent of the population ; by 2000 , this figure had grown to 360 million , representing about half the population .
Quantitatively , this may well be the largest shift in religious affiliation that has ever occurred , anywhere .
If we focus on the Catholic population alone , Africa had 1.9 million Catholics in 1900 , but by 2000 the continent ’s Catholic population had risen to 130 million , representing a gross increase of 6,708 percent .
And yet another figure for the Catholic world should give us pause .
In 2000 , there were more Catholic baptisms in the Philippines than in France , Spain , Italy , and Poland combined .
By 2025 , approximately 60 percent of Catholics around the world will probably live in Africa and Latin America alone — not counting the Philippines , China , or India - and the proportion should reach two — thirds before 2050 .
At that point , European and Euro - American Catholics will be a small fragment of a church dominated by Filipinos , Mexicans , Brazilians , Nigerians , and ?
Congolese .
If we were just noting the story of an ethnic and geographic shift , that would be an interesting story in its own right , but one of limited significance .
Far more important , though , is the change in belief and practice in the growing churches of the Global South .
Part of the change is founded in social and economic realities .
At least for the foreseeable future , members of a southern - dominated church are likely to be among the poorer people on the planet , in marked contrast
to the older western - dominated world .
For this reason , some western Christians have since the 1960s expected that the religion of their Third World brethren would be fervently liberal , activist , and even revolutionary , the model represented by liberation theology .
In this view , the new Christianity would chiefly be concerned with pulling down the mighty from their seats , through political action or even armed struggle .
All too often , though , these hopes have proved illusory .
Frequently , the liberationist voices emanating from the Third World proved to derive from clerics trained in Europe and North America , and their ideas won only limited local appeal .
Southern Christians would not avoid political activism , but they would become involved strictly on their own terms .
While many espoused political liberation , they made it inseparable from deliverance from supernatural evil .
The two terms are indeed related linguistically and often appear together in biblical texts , but the juxtaposition of the two thought - worlds of liberation and deliverance seems as baffling for many Euro - Americans as it is natural for Christians in the Global South .
Of course , we must be careful about generalizations concerning the vast and diverse world of southern Christianities , and I stress the plural .
There is no single southern Christianity , any more than there is such a thing as European or North American Christianity : Each of these terms involves numerous components , some strongly at odds with the others .
Yet we can reasonably say that many Global South Christians are more conservative in terms of both beliefs and moral teaching than are the mainstream churches of the Global North , and this is especially true in Africa .
The churches that have made most dramatic progress in the Global South have been either Catholic ( of a traditionalist and fideistic kind ) or evangelical and Pentecostal Protestant sects .
Membership in Pentecostal and independent churches already runs into the hundreds of millions , and congregations are located in precisely the regions of fastest population growth .
Within a few decades , such denominations will represent a far - larger segment of global Christianity and just conceivably a majority .
These newer churches preach deep personal faith and communal orthodoxy , mysticism , and puritanism , all founded on clear scriptural authority .
They preach messages that , to a westerner , appear simplistically charismatic , visionary , and apocalyptic .
In this thought - world , prophecy is an everyday reality , while faith healing , exorcism , and dream - visions are all fundamental parts of religious sensibility .
For better or worse , the dominant churches of the future could have much in common with those of medieval or early modern European times .
As recently as a decade ago , North - South differences made little impact on the consciousness of most American Christians .
What has changed this most radically , perhaps , has been the sharp split within the Episcopal Church ( ECUSA ) and the wider Anglican Communion , chiefly over issues of gender and sexuality .
The story has been often told .
The prime detonator was the Episcopal decision in 2003 to approve the ordination of Gene Robinson , a noncelibate homosexual , to the diocese of New Hampshire , a decision that infuriated the thriving Anglican churches of Africa .
Since that time , North - South conflicts have intensified .
Under the leadership of the Nigerian church ( some 20 million strong ) , an alliance of conservative Global South churches has flatly accused the Americans and British of departing far from biblical principles :
“ The unscriptural innovations of North American and some western provinces on issues of human sexuality undermine the basic message of redemption and the power of the Cross to transform lives .
These departures are a symptom of a deeper problem , which is the diminution of the authority of Holy Scripture . ”
Schism within the communion now seems likely .
In the strong words of one conservative English bishop , Michael Nazir - Ali , “ Nobody wants a split , but if you think you have virtually two religions in a single church , something has got to give sometime . ”
To describe the two sides as constituting separate religions , rather than different perspectives on one common Christian faith , is a significant departure .
Rowan Williams further shocked American liberals when he suggested creating a two - tier system within the Anglican Communion , in which churches like ECUSA that followed practices rejected by the wider communion would possess only associate rather than full membership .
Yet even this response to ECUSA was not enough for the Nigerians , who urged that a “ cancerous lump in the body should be excised if it has defied every known cure . ”
In the words of Kenyan archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi , “ Our understanding of the Bible is different from them .
We are two different churches . ”
For many Americans , and not just liberals , the Anglican feud suggests a grim and even frightening future for Christianity , a sign perhaps that the shift in global numbers means the inevitable triumph of a kind of fundamentalist faith deeply imbued with superstition .
Underlying this vision is a grave doubt about the religious substance of the Christianity emerging from Africa or Asia :
Is it really Christianity or , in effect , a survival of older animism , complete with tribal sexual codes ?
At an Episcopal gathering in 2002 , one gay activist condemned African conservatives for “ monkeying around ” in the church : “ All I have to say to these bishops is : Go back to the jungle where you came from ! ”
Sober academics seek other reasons for the charismatic nature of much religion in the Global South .
Why , for instance , do these churches so emphasize healing , visions , and prophecy ?
Perhaps , one might suggest , they are rather too much in contact with their pre-Christian roots , with traditional worlds of healing or magic or shamanism .
I suggest a different interpretation .
Whatever we think of specific moral or political questions at issue between Global North and South , the critical difference concerns attitudes to authority , and any acquaintance with African or Asian Christianity soon indicates the pervasive importance of the Bible and of biblical stories .
The Bible has found a congenial home among communities who identify with the social and economic realities it portrays , no less than among the political environments in which Christians find themselves .
Cultures that readily identify with biblical worldviews find it easier to read the Bible not just as historical fact but also as relevant instruction for daily conduct .
Attitudes to the Old Testament provide a good example .
For many American Christians , it is obvious that the stories of the ancient Hebrew world arise from an utterly different social and economic setting of limited practical relevance to a modern society .
In contrast , it is precisely the Old Testament world that speaks in contemporary tones to many African and Asian Christians .
“ If present day Africans still find it difficult to be at home with the Old Testament , they might need to watch out to see if they have not lost their Africanness in one way or the other , ” writes Madipoane Masenya , a feminist liberal theologian from South Africa .
Could a comparable observation conceivably be made of contemporary Europeans or North Americans ?
Cultural affinities with the biblical world lead African and Asian Christians to see the Old Testament as their story , their book .
In Africa particularly , Christians have long been excited by the obvious cultural parallels that exist between their own societies and those of the Hebrew Old Testament .
In much of Africa , social events frequently involve some kind of sacrifice or libation , as do celebrations of key events in the ceremonial year .
In the New Testament , the Letter to the Hebrews and the Book of Revelation seem especially relevant .
For modern Africans , as for the original audience of Revelation , writes Fidon Mwombeki , a Tanzanian Lutheran leader , “ [t ] he dead are still living in the other world , and they influence the life of those in this world . ”
He discusses the exalted picture of God and the common belief that the future can be seen through visions , dreams , and revelations .
Moreover , he writes : “ the dominant symbols of the lamb , the throne , the blood , and the animals are common in African religious symbolism .
The sacrificial blood , as well as innocent human blood crying from the ground ( Rev. 6:10 ) , corresponds to present - day African beliefs .
No one in Africa can expect to get away with shedding innocent blood .
At the same time , the lamb as the animal of sacrifice slaughtered for the sins of humanity is a dominant symbol both in Revelation and in African beliefs . ”
Evangelical religion with a central notion of being saved in the blood has exercised immense appeal in modern Africa .
Perhaps the greatest African hymn is “ Tukutendereza Yesu , ” the song of the blood of the lamb .
When observers complain that revivals and healing crusades make little explicit reference to evangelical theology , that is partly because pastors can reasonably assume their hearers will already know so many of these doctrines .
A sacrificial society is uniquely equipped to understand theories of atonement , which can never have more than metaphorical power in a culture such as our own .
It is one thing to sing of sacrifice , to hymn the power in the blood ; it is quite another to have seen and smelled the event take place .
How many American evangelicals have had such an experience ?
The more time one spends with southern Christians , reading the Bible through their eyes , the harder it is to see the Bible as simply a historical text .
And the more immediately one understands the biblical world , the easier it becomes to accept the authority of the text .
In the words of another very liberal theologian , Kenya ’s Musimbi Kanyoro , “ Those cultures which are far removed from biblical culture risk reading the Bible as fiction . ”
Particularly appealing are the parables , in which Jesus incorporated so many observations of contemporary conditions .
Across Africa and Asia , millions of modern readers have been on roads where a traveler is likely to be robbed and left for dead , without much hope of intervention by official agencies .
They understand accounts of streets teeming with the sick .
They know that a poor woman who loses a tiny sum of money would search frantically for coins that could allow her children to eat that night .
In many countries , readers appreciate the picture of the capricious rich man , who offers hospitality on one occasion but on another day demands payment of exorbitant debts and obligations , and who must not on any account be offended .
On occasion , the social background of the Global South allows readers to see dimensions of the text that have been largely lost in a postindustrial world .
Like Europeans in bygone centuries , many modern Africans and Asians read biblical tales of plague and famine as powerfully contemporary .
Perhaps only hungry eyes can appreciate just how thoroughly images of food and feasting , eating and starving , pervade both Testaments .
Throughout the Bible , being filled with food is for most people an unusual prospect , as was true for most societies before the eighteenth century , including those of western Europe .
In Luke ’s Magnificat , Mary celebrates a radical vision of a society in which God will fill the hungry while sending the rich away empty .
When the prodigal son comes home , driven by famine , he is given a banquet complete with fatted calf .
Encountering such visions of plenty has an immeasurably greater impact in a society that knows hunger than in a western community where the most prominent food - related story of recent years was an alleged obesity epidemic .
The spirit of the biblical world is movingly summarized by the contemporary grace said by rural Chinese Christians : “ Today ’s food is not easy to come by .
God gives it to us .
After we eat it , we will not be sick .
God protects us so that we can have the next meal .
He protects us so everything is prosperous and we have peace .
All our family members , from young to old , need the protection from God . ”
Nor can most African or Asian readers be complacent about the easy availability of water .
The numerous biblical passages about plentiful water mean a great deal in nations that can only dream of such a luxury .
Such readers share the amazed expectation of the Samaritan woman at the well , when Jesus promises her a reliable source of living water .
Within a few years , perhaps half the world ’s people will live in countries that are lacking sufficient water .
One of the most harrowing stories of the whole Bible occurs in Elisha ’s time , when a woman begs the king to enforce the agreement she had made with her neighbor in response to the raging famine .
First they would eat the son of one woman , then the son of another , but the other woman was reneging on the deal .
Would the king not grant her justice , by ordering the second act of cannibalism ?
However grotesque the story , millions of modern readers can understand the desperation that lies at its center .
They know that , while men can sometimes flee a famine - stricken area , women remain behind with the children .
How many American churches have ever heard sermons on this particular text ?
Food shortages form the subject of modern Christian hymns and writings .
Ghanaian poet Afua Kuma declares :
The famine has become severe .
Let us go and tell Jesus !
He is the one who
When he raises his hands
Gives even our enemies their share
And our brothers bring head pans
To carry the food away .
The radicalism can hardly be appreciated in societies that do not know famine :
Not only does God grant food in time of hunger , but he even pours blessings on our enemies .
The prevalence of hunger and natural disaster helps explain the enormous popularity in Christian Africa and Asia of the Book of Ruth , a tale of a society devastated by famine , in which women survive by depending on each other and on trusted kin .
In the American context , the book attracts some interest from feminist scholars , while Ruth ’s plea to Naomi , “ entreat me not to leave thee , ” is included in blessing rites for same - sex couples .
In the Global South , the book ’s interest lies in how the various characters faithfully fulfill their obligations to each other and their relatives .
What the North reads in moral or individualistic terms remains for the South social and communal .
Particularly appealing in Global South churches are the wisdom texts , such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes , but also the New Testament ’s Epistle of James .
Wisdom literature is popular , in part , because of its profound sense of the transience of life .
One of the most - used sermon texts in Africa is James 4:14 : “ Ye know not what shall be on the morrow .
For what is your life ?
It is even a vapor , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away . ”
Echoes of this text often resurface in paraphrased form .
In the Sudan , which for some forty years has suffered repeated civil wars and the vicious persecution of non-Muslims , one Christian chorus teaches the grim truth that “ [ y ] ou are here today but tomorrow you ’ll be here no more .
Our only hope is Jesus Christ , so receive him now . ”
In the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami , sermons in south and east Asian churches made great use of James .
If there is a single critical marker distinguishing the Christianity of the modern West from the New Testament world , it is the basic belief in the supernatural character of evil , which is manifested equally in sickness , repression , wickedness , and compulsiveness .
The North - South divide is not absolute , and some Euro - American Christians accept theories of the diabolic and demonic , of supernatural warfare and spiritual healing .
Yet most northern - world Christians share the bemusement , the mockery , with which the more secular - minded regard such manifestations .
For post -Enlightenment Christians in the West , the demonic elements in the New Testament mean so little that they are scarcely even an embarrassment anymore .
Many westerners read over such passages and attribute them to a long - departed stage of scientific development .
Most northern readers today would label believers in demons and witchcraft irredeemably premodern , prescientific , and probably preliterate — and such beliefs would cast doubt on believers ’ claims to an authentic or intelligent religion .
Yet the supernatural approach certainly harks back to the ancient roots of Christianity .
To read the gospels is to make the intimate acquaintance of demons and demonic forces .
Precious little is left of the New Testament after we purge all mentions of angels , demons , and spirits .
Shorn of healing and miraculous cures , the four gospels would be a slim pamphlet indeed .
For the earliest followers of Jesus — and presumably for Jesus himself — healing and exorcism were essential components of his proclamation .
In his acts of healing , Jesus was not just curing individuals but trampling diabolical forces underfoot , and the signs and wonders represented visible and material tokens of Christ ’s victory over real forces of evil .
Leaders of the early church carried on this tradition .
One landmark in the history of trinitarian doctrine is the creed proclaimed by the third - century saint Gregory Thaumaturgus .
Yet Gregory ’s title name , Thaumaturgus , “ wonder - worker , ” recalls his fame as an exorcist and healer who repeatedly overcame demons and pagan deities .
Describing the Christian message first brought to Europe and the Roman frontier lands , Peter Brown comments that “ Christians worshipped the one high God ; but unlike modern post - Enlightenment Christians , who are wary of the notion of a universe crowded with intermediary beings , they positively gloried in the closeness of invisible guides and protectors . . . .
They did not carry around in their heads the empty skies of [ modern European ] missionary Christianity . ”
For northerners , such demonological readings raise troubling questions about the future of Christianity .
Yet a Christian worldview that acknowledges supernatural evil does not disqualify itself from participation in worldly struggles , including movements for far - reaching social and economic transformation .
Whatever their spiritual truth — whatever their fidelity to Christian tradition — supernatural approaches can be valuable in moving societies away from pernicious traditional superstitions .
For instance , offering distinctively Christian solutions to witchcraft helps disarm the sometimes bloody practices of anti-witchcraft rituals .
In a relatively short time , the new Christian emphasis on prayer and Bible reading defuses the fatalism inherent in a traditional system based on such notions as witchcraft , curses , and the power of ancestors .
Instead , Christians are taught to rely on faith and on the role of the individual , who is no longer a slave to destiny or fate .
By treating older notions of spiritual evil seriously , Christians are leading an epochal cultural revolution .
For millions of modern Christians — as for the contemporaries of Gregory Thaumaturgus — proclaiming the power of Jesus means declaring his victory over conquered forces of evil .
One hymn from the Transvaal declares :
Jesus Christ is Conqueror
By his resurrection he overcame death itself
By his resurrection he overcame all things
He overcame magic
He overcame amulets and charms
He overcame the darkness of demon possession
He overcame dread
When we are with him
We also conquer .
Such a hymn could easily have been sung by Mediterranean Christians of the first three centuries after Jesus ’ time .
Still more startlingly martial is a hymn of the Ghanaian Afua Kuma :
If Satan troubles us
Jesus Christ
You who are the lion of the grasslands
You whose claws are sharp
Will tear out his entrails
And leave them on the ground
For the flies to eat .
Demonology is credible for African and Asian churches in a way it can scarcely be for most educated westerners , and so are ideas of exorcism and healing .
A leader of the West African Musama Disco Christo Church preaches : “ We are all here in this church because we have found healing here .
But for this church , the great majority of us here assembled would not be alive today .
That is the reason why we are here . ”
The point is so obvious in Africa , and so very strange to western believers .
Spiritual healing is accepted across most denominations , including those that in North America would be regarded as strictly mainstream .
At a healing revival in Uganda , a woman reported being cured of a spinal complaint .
After this event , “ a whole stream of people . . . stood up one by one to declare joyfully what Jesus had done for them .
They had been dumb , mad or psychologically disturbed ; crippled , epileptic , hemorrhaging ; they had had cancer , epilepsy and asthma .
By turns they declared that they had been healed by prayer and the power of the Lord Jesus .
So many people wanted to testify that in the end the parish catechist simply resorted to calling out the afflictions and doing a head count of those who had been healed . ”
This may sound like the typical currency of charismatic movements the world over , except that this particular example occurred in a Roman Catholic church , through the ministry of an Indian priest , and the initial miracle described took place during the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament .
Western observers of Christianity in the Global South often try to impose familiar categories : divisions between conservative and liberal , for instance , or otherworldly charismatics and this - worldly social activists .
Countless American examples demonstrate the flaws in this analysis , but in the churches of the Global South the division makes even less sense .
Deliverance and liberation are one .
The biblical enthusiasm in the Global South is often embraced by exactly those groups ordinarily portrayed as the victims of reactionary religion , particularly women .
In Titus Presler ’s book The Transfigured Night , a study of the Zimbabwean night - vigil movement , we hear that “ Charismatic renewal , conflict with demons , and the liberation of women are other fruits bearing directly on the churches ’ mission in Zimbabwe . ”
For African Christians , women ’s social emancipation must be seen in the context of spiritual warfare and exorcism :
Both are manifestations of “ loosing , ” of liberation , of deliverance .
Through the churches , through the Bible , previously marginalized groups learn to speak out for the first time in the history of those ? cultures .
Partly , the willingness to explore socially radical solutions reflects a fundamental distrust of secular authority and institutions that again marks a difference between North and South .
The New Testament portrays persecution as a likely consequence of Christian belief .
In Mark ’s gospel , Jesus warns his followers of bleak times to come , warns about when they are led before a court , not if .
Most western readers see in such passages only historical references to long - gone times of persecution .
But persecution is a real prospect for much of the new Christianity , and martyrdom is a continuing reality for many African and Asian churches .
All too often , secular ideologies appear destructive :
Their claims to provide growth and improvement prove farcically false , and they sometimes undertake bloody repression .
Even when states are not actively homicidal , the common assumption — in the twenty - first century , as in the first — is that the state is a hostile institution and that secular society must be seen as dangerous territory in which believers tread at their peril .
Christians are rarely wise to put their faith in princes or presidents .
Southern Christians easily identify with the profoundly anti-state and separatist texts in the New Testament produced by early believers living within the Roman Empire .
Such diffidence — to say the least — about the secular world contrasts sharply with attitudes in the Global North .
If Global South believers are accused of “ supernaturalism , ” we might well ask what grounds they would have for putting their trust in developments in this unjust world .
In many matters , the Christianity of Africa and Asia operates in a world closely congruent with the early or medieval forms of the faith .
Societies with a potent sense of the communal and collective can appreciate the Old Testament notion of national righteousness and national sin , ideas that can justify harsh moral legislation but that also encourage prophetic visions of social justice .
A world of biting poverty and endemic disaster understands the transience of human life — and , equally , of states .
Societies that know the threat of persecution , that have experienced anti-Christian violence in living memory , feel a strong affinity to the sections of the Bible that regard the secular state coldly , that present suffering as the likely lot of the Christian in this life .
In such communities , apocalyptic literature — especially the Book of Revelation — has a near - documentary relevance .
A discussion of “ Believing in the Global South ” must , of course , examine the nature of belief in the Christian churches in Africa , Asia , and Latin America .
But it is also worth thinking about the many in Europe or North America who place their faith in that emerging Christianity , who believe in the Global South .
Over the past half - century , whenever southern Christianity has gained attention in North America or Europe , it has been through what might be termed two dreams — two competing visions , each trying to deploy that new religious movement for its own purposes .
For the left , attracted by visions of liberation , the rise of the South suggests that northern Christians must commit themselves to social and political activism at home , to ensuring economic justice and combating racism , to promoting cultural diversity .
Conservatives , in contrast , emphasize the moral and sexual conservatism of the emerging churches and seek to enlist them as natural allies .
For both the Liberation Dream and the Conservative Dream , the new South has seemed useful , politically and rhetorically .
Each , in its different way , expects the southern churches to reproduce western obsessions and approaches rather than to evolve their own distinctive solutions to their own particular problems .
We must be cautious about seeing such new movements through the lens of our own conflicts .
As an analogy , imagine the situation in the seventh or eighth centuries in what was still , numerically and culturally , the Near Eastern heart of Christianity , in Syria or Mesopotamia .
Picture a meeting of church leaders who have gathered to hear a report from a traveler from the remote barbarian world of western Europe .
The traveler delights his listeners by telling them of the many new conversions among the strange peoples of England or Germany and the creation of whole new dioceses in the midst of the northern forests .
Impatiently , the assembled hierarchs press him to answer the key question :
This new Christianity coming into being , is it the Christianity of Edessa or of Damascus ?
Where do the new converts stand on the crucial issues of the day : on the Monothelite heresy , on Iconoclasm ?
When the traveler tells them , regretfully , that these issues really do not register in those parts of the world , where religious life has utterly different concerns and emphases , the Syrians are alarmed .
Is this really a new Christianity , they ask , or is it some new syncretistic horror ?
How can any Christian not be centrally concerned with these issues ?
And while Syrian Christianity carried on debating these questions to exhaustion , the new churches of Europe entered a great age of spiritual growth and intellectual endeavor .
As in those times , it is extremely difficult to envisage the future trajectory of the faith .
Who in that age could have foreseen the global expansion of that poor hatchling , western Christianity ?
Today , similarly , we see promising signs of growth as southern Christians begin evangelizing the North , in the process changing many familiar aspects of belief and practice and exporting cultural traits presently found only in Africa or Latin America .
We can only speculate what this future synthesis might look like .
But underlying all these possibilities is one solid reality .
However partisan the interpretations of the new Christianity , however paternalistic , there can be no doubt that the emerging Christian world will be anchored in the southern continents .
When we look at today ’s new faces of Christianity , we are seeing the shape of the Christian future .

Many leaders resort to war only as a last resort , and vow to achieve their results quickly .
Here are a few wars that did just that , including one that was over in less time than it would take to watch a History Channel special about it .
1. Sino -Vietnamese War ( 27 Days )
The 1979 Sino - Vietnamese War was the third in a little over twenty years between the two countries and was started , in part , by unresolved issues from previous conflicts .
China supported the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , while Vietnam opposed it .
Cambodia feared an invasion by Vietnam after diplomatic relations collapsed , and so they attacked Vietnam first , resulting in Vietnam invading and occupying Cambodia for over a decade .
After large - scale fighting between Vietnam and Cambodia ended , China stood up for their ally and attacked Soviet - backed Vietnam .
The Chinese attacked Vietnam along their shared border and took several small villages in heavy combat .
On March 5 , the Chinese announced the campaign was over , stating that they had made their point and adequately chastised Vietnam for its actions .
This war would be only 16 days long ; however , the Chinese continued to cause extensive damage to villages , roads and railroads during their retreat .
The conflict was officially resolved on March 16 , 1979 , just 27 days after it began .
Both sides claimed victory and heavy but unconfirmed casualties .
The Vietnamese government continuously requested an official apology from the Chinese government for its seemingly pointless invasion of Vietnam , but never got one .
Relations were normalized in 1990 after several small border skirmishes , and Vietnam officially dropped its demand for an apology .
Vietnam continued to occupy Cambodia until 1989 , though the Khmer Rouge had been seriously weakened by the Vietnamese occupation .
2. The India - Pakistan War ( 13 Days )
India and Pakistan are n't exactly known as friendly neighbors .
Skirmishes , diplomatic aggression and war are common — in fact , the 1971 conflict was the third since the countries gained independence in 1947 .
The shortest and perhaps most devastating war originated over the independence of East Pakistan , now Bangladesh .
Pakistan was accused of many atrocities against humanity in East Pakistan ( which it ruled ) , causing as many as 10 million refugees to flee to India .
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi used diplomacy with the UN and the Soviet Union to strengthen India 's position and provided weapons to the East Pakistanis .
Though both sides had prepared for war , Pakistan launched an air strike on December 3 , 1971 , and India immediately declared war .
Indian forces used blitzkreig techniques to quickly overpower the Pakistanis .
Pakistan forces in Bangladesh surrendered on December 16 ; the rest of Pakistan surrendered the next day .
3. The Anglo - Zanzibar War ( 40 Minutes )
Taking the prize as the shortest war on the history books is the Anglo - Zanzibar War , measured not in months , days , or even hours , but minutes ( about 40 of them ) .
Back in the day of British imperialism , the British administered the island of Zanzibar ( now part of Tanzania ) as a sovereign protectorate with a puppet government .
When favored Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini died on August 25 , 1896 , he was immediately replaced by his nephew Khalid bin Barghash , who was n't exactly the guy the British had in mind — and on top of that , he was suspected of killing his uncle .
The British used a succession treaty signed earlier in the year to leverage an ultimatum : abdicate or face war .
Instead , Sultan Khalid raised his flag outside his palace and barricaded himself inside along with his guards and about 2800 Zanzibaris .
By the time the deadline expired two days later , the British had amassed a powerful naval fleet just outside the palace .
The Zanzibaris , believing that the British would n't open fire , sent a page telling them just that .
The British promptly unleashed a powerful bombardment of shells , machine gun fire and cannonballs .
The attack lasted about 40 minutes but caused extensive damage .
The wooden palace had caught fire , the Sultan 's flag had been removed , and 500 natives had been killed .
The British took over the demolished palace and installed their Sultan of choice , while Sultan Khalid escaped to German East Africa , where he was captured in 1916 during World War I .
There were no further altercations between the Zanzibaris and the British for the remainder of their reign , which lasted until December of 1963 .

That leaves several other possibilities .
Perhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material , a particular problem for the right side of the colon .
“ After the prep has been completed , mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon , ” Dr. Rex explained .
The secretions , he added , pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are “ very sticky ” and can obscure polyps .
One solution , supported by six studies , is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy , Dr. Rex said .
That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning , something that often is not done , he added , but that he and others recommend .
Cancer may also be different in the right colon , researchers said .
Flat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon .
And so do another kind , serrated lesions , which , some studies indicate , might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps .
“ It ’s possible that we will never get as good a result ” in the right colon , said Robert Smith , director of screening for the American Cancer Society .
Still , he said , that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies .
The tests are “ hugely expensive , ” he said , and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies .
The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel .
Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers , colon cancer remains a rare disease and , after a colonoscopy , “ the likelihood that you have cancer is very , very low , ” Dr. Smith said .
Dr. Harold C. Sox , editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine , is choosing another option .
He is having a stool test , the fecal occult blood test , between colonoscopies .
It looks for blood in the stool , which can arise from colon cancer .

Agency tightens rules for foreign visitors .
R. HOMAVANDI / REUTERS
Europe 's largest basic - research agency , the CNRS in France , is now vetting not only non-European Union ( EU ) researchers working on sensitive topics , but also all scientists from Iran regardless of what they work on .
Researchers allege that the move exacerbates an already difficult situation in which visa applications are denied based on nationality .
A 12 November memo , relayed by the CNRS 's security office from the state national security and industrial espionage services , requires that all projects with Iran go through formal security screening , to identify ones potentially meriting further scrutiny .
It translates UN sanctions that call for member states not to provide Iran with technical assistance or training that might be used for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , says Joseph Illand , who heads the CNRS security office .
It 's the first case Illand can recall of such an explicit country - specific instruction at the CNRS — although similar , if unwritten , restrictions have in practice long been in effect for Iran and other countries considered as security risks .
Given the threat of proliferation , such extra scrutiny is normal , he says .
The rules expand on those introduced in January 2005 , which require extra scrutiny for visits from non-EU scientists whose work relates to an undisclosed list of ' sensitive ' laboratories or topics .
In such cases , the heads of host laboratories must give details of proposed visits , and their opinion of the visitor , to security authorities .
For less - sensitive laboratories , lab heads need only declare foreign visitors monthly , whereas no-risk labs must simply maintain an internal register that can be consulted by authorities if needed .
“ They need to stop looking at researchers ' passports , and start looking at their work . ”
In recent years , Iranian researchers have struggled for academic equality and scientific access .
In July , for instance , the Netherlands banned Iranians from accessing nuclear laboratories or courses , and the United States has subjected Iranian visa requests to lengthy interagency reviews in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Britain last year also introduced tough vetting of non-EU science students .
The fact that France is cracking down on Iranian researchers does n't surprise Carthage Smith , deputy executive director for the International Council for Science in Paris , and a member of its human - rights committee .
" There are legitimate concerns in the international community at present about the risk of technology transfer to Iran and other specific countries , " he says .
" We can't ignore that . "
But he worries about how the rules might be implemented .
" Any vetting must be separate from country lists , with each individual case being judged on its merits , " he says .
Otherwise , overzealous bureaucrats could turn country listings into effective blacklists .
Formalizing extra vetting for Iranian researchers may have secondary effects , admits Illand , in that French hosts might show less interest in collaborating with Iranians to avoid administrative hassle , or government bureaucrats may be tempted to play safe and turn down visa applications .
Many within the CNRS and the French administration , he says , support greater collaboration with Iran as a form of scientific diplomacy .
Overall statistics are not available , but Nature has gathered complaints from more than a dozen Iranian scientists who allege that French authorities recently either refused their requests for visas or simply never responded .
Take Ali Tahzibi , a mathematician and Iranian national at the Federal University of São Carlos in Brazil .
In July he applied for a visa to work for a year , starting in October , with Christian Bonatti at the CNRS 's Institute of Mathematics , part of the University of Bourgogne in Dijon .
Tahzibi took a year 's sabbatical , bought plane tickets for himself and his family , rented an apartment in Dijon , and arranged schooling for his son .
The visa never materialized .
" To wait up until just hours before your flight in the hope of getting a visa without obtaining any response was torture for a family with a little child , " says Tahzibi .

Visa - seeking researchers share common stories of being passed back and forth within the French bureaucracy .
" It 's a typical administrative vicious circle , " says Pierre Sens , a researcher at the Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution , who tried to intervene on behalf of a former postdoc and Iranian national .
The office of Valérie Pécresse , the minister of research and higher education , declined to comment on the allegations or their impact on collaboration , instead referring Nature to the ministry of immigration .
The cases and the CNRS policy are " absolutely astonishing , if not scandalous on the part of a country such as France , which sees itself as the cradle of human rights " , says Thierry Dauxois , a CNRS physicist at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Lyon .
" They need to stop looking at researchers ' passports , and start looking at their work . "

Billionaire T. Boone Pickens said that his Texas wind farm is on hold because natural - gas prices have dropped but that his plan for wind power and natural - gas vehicles is still viable to reduce foreign oil imports .
The Texas oil tycoon spoke Tuesday to about 650 utility and investment officials gathered in Phoenix for the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference .
Pickens launched an advertising campaign last summer to promote wind farms to generate electricity and to use natural gas to power vehicles .
" I'm the only person in the United States that has a plan , " he said .
" Senator Obama and his people have been in touch with mine .
They see the merits of what we are doing . "
Pickens said the U.S. needs to exploit all its resources , from solar power in Arizona to coal and nuclear energy , but that few things could cut foreign oil imports quickly .
He said neither Obama 's plans for 1 million plug - in hybrid vehicles nor John McCain 's plans for 45 more nuclear plants would make a dent in oil imports , but semitrucks fueled by natural gas could reduce oil demand for the next 20 years before better transportation technology is available .
" It 's a bridge to the next generation , which will probably be the battery , the fuel cell , " he said .
" It wo n't be the hydrocarbon . "
But the current drop in oil and natural - gas prices is slowing things down .
Until natural - gas prices rise , Pickens said his wind farm and most others in the country will not go forward because electricity from gas plants will be more economical .
Still , he was confident prices would rise .
He said Americans have n't understood the nation 's energy challenges because prices have been low , until last summer when oil hit a record $ 147 a barrel .
" You have n't had the leadership in Washington to tell us what the problem was , " he said .
" The American people did not realize where we were .
When oil went to $ 100 , I had a story to tell . "
Steven Dreyer , managing director at Standard and Poor 's , credited Pickens for raising awareness .
" Arguably , for the first time , ordinary people were able to connect the dots between carbon reduction and energy , " Dreyer said .
Ron Insana , managing director of SAC Capital Advisors and former CNBC commentator , questioned Pickens about how he will benefit financially by such a plan through his wind farm and large stake in Clean Energy Fuels Corp. , a natural - gas , vehicle - fueling company .
Pickens described his potential to profit from wind and natural gas but said his motivations are patriotic .
" I 'd rather be playing golf at the Del Mar Country Club this afternoon , " Pickens said .
" But I truly believe this is good for the country . "
Pickens believes that global oil production has already " peaked " and that it will continue to become scarcer and more expensive , despite the current lull in gas prices .
He is founder and chairman of energy - investment company BP Capital and founded Mesa Petroleum , a natural - gas and oil producer .
He is a geologist by training .
" When I launched my plan July 8 , gas prices were $ 4.11 a gallon , and now they 're half that .
I think I 've done a pretty good job , " he said to chuckles from the audience .
He predicted oil , which closed Tuesday at $ 59 , to be $ 100 a barrel within a year , and could be $ 300 a barrel by 2018 .
Pickens supports domestic drilling but said that can't come close to meeting daily U.S. oil demand .
He is scheduled to return Dec. 11 for a presentation to the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce , and tickets are available to the public .
Details are available at www.phoenixchamber.com.
Anger and frustration over rampant killings and kidnappings have ignited an improbable debate here over legalizing the death penalty , a punishment that has been effectively banned in Mexico for nearly half a century .
Lawmakers agreed Thursday to hear arguments next week on a proposal to amend the Mexican Constitution to allow for capital punishment in a narrow number of cases .
The initiative from Humberto Moreira , governor of the northern border state of Coahuila , would allow the death penalty for convicted kidnappers who killed or mutilated their victims .
He said as far as the people of his state were concerned , the only issue was how to execute convicts , not whether to do so .
It is highly unlikely , if not impossible , that the death penalty could be reinstated because of legal obstacles , experts said .
But that is almost beside the point .
Moreira has tapped into public panic over soaring crime , a climate of fear that has made law and order the country ’s No. 1 worry .

Much of the bloodshed is related to Mexico ’s drug war , as government forces crack down on powerful traffickers and traffickers battle one another over pieces of the lucrative trade .
But violence is spilling into ordinary society .
Two recent kidnappings of children of affluent Mexicans -- one turned up dead and the other has not been found -- underlined the public ’s vulnerability .
As much as the crimes themselves , the fact that there are few prosecutions -- impunity and no justice -- riles Mexican society .
“ If 98 % of criminals escape prosecution for their crimes , it is clear that the population feels wounded and tends to support capital punishment , ” Gerardo Priego , a legislator from the ruling National Action Party , or PAN , told reporters .
Moreira ’s initiative received quick support from several state governors from his Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
Advertisement
But critics accused Moreira of demagoguery and of taking advantage of the public mood for political gain .
Mexico City ’s Human Rights Commission said a return to state - administered executions would set the country back 200 years .
“ Behind this call [ for the death penalty ] is society ’s desperation over the climate of insecurity we are living in , ” said Alberto Herrera , head of the Mexico chapter of Amnesty International .
“ But the risk is it leads to calls for revenge .
Times of desperation are the worst times to go for facile solutions . ”
Reinstatement of the death penalty is unlikely for legal and political reasons .
The last execution in Mexico was in 1961 , coincidentally in Coahuila , the state where the current initiative originated .
Capital punishment remained on the books , primarily within the military judicial system , but was unused and abolished in 2005 .
In 1981 , Mexico signed a human rights treaty as part of the Organization of American States that dictated the death penalty , once eliminated , could not be revived .
Advertisement
Furthermore , the PAN , which holds sway in Congress , says it opposes changing the constitution to allow capital punishment .
Recent polls showed support for the death penalty surging to as much as two - thirds of the surveyed population .
Miguel Carbonell , a constitutional law expert at Mexico ’s National Autonomous University , said that despite public outcry , the chance of imposing the death penalty , given the international treaties that Mexico signed , was “ nil . ”
“ We are all very worried about the security situation and want strong measures , ” he said .
“ But the state cannot fall into the same criminal behavior as the criminals . ”

In separate action Thursday , the lower house of Mexico ’s Congress approved a package of state security measures aimed at strengthening the government ’s ability to fight drug traffickers and organized crime .
Key among the measures were provisions to prevent the infiltration of police forces by criminals .

For all the potential , experts see some formidable obstacles on the path to the promised land of personalized medicine .
“ It ’s going to take 20 to 30 years for all this to fall into place , ” said Dr. Gregory Downing , who heads efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services to spur personalized health care .
The hurdles include drug makers , which can be reluctant to develop or encourage tests that may limit the use of their drugs .
Insurers may not pay for tests , which can cost up to a few thousand dollars .
For makers of the tests , which hope their business becomes one of health care ’s next big growth industries , a major obstacle is proving that their products are accurate and useful .
While drugs must prove themselves in clinical trials before they can be sold , there is no generally recognized process for evaluating genetic tests , many of which can be marketed by laboratories without F.D.A. approval .
Genentech , a developer of cancer drugs , petitioned the F.D.A. this month to regulate such tests .
It warned of “ safety risks for patients , as more treatment decisions are based in whole or in part on the claims made by such test makers . ”
A cautionary case is Herceptin , a Genentech breast cancer drug that is considered the archetype of personalized medicine because it works only for women whose tumors have a particular genetic characteristic .
But now , 10 years after Herceptin reached the market , scientists are finding that the various tests — some approved by the F.D.A. , some not — can be inaccurate .
Moreover , doctors do not always conduct the tests or follow the results .
The big insurer UnitedHealthcare found in 2005 that 8 percent of the women getting the drug had tested negative for the required genetic characteristic .
An additional 4 percent had not been tested at all , or their test results could not be found .
Britney Spears is trying to get her ‘ career ’ back on track after years of insanity .
Between marrying rap master Kevin Federline , spawning his two devil children , shaving her head , showing her crotch to the world and taking an umbrella to a car , her A - list celebrity status quickly eroded to WTF - is - wrong - with - this - celebrity status .
Between shelling out $ 22,000 per month to feed the starving rap artist formerly never known as K - Fed , who put out stellar singles like PopozÃ£o and “ Y’all ai n’t ready ” ( are you kidding me ? ) , paying her father roughly $ 11,000 per month , maintaining her ridiculous spending lifestyle , Britney is fast approaching bankruptcy if she does n’t get her act together .
To get her body back in shape , she has been spending roughly $ 22,000 per month on a nutritionist and a personal trainer .
It was rumored that she tipped the scales at a chunky 144lbs during her heated custody battle with K - Fed , but has recently slimmed down to roughly 125 lbs .
Britney released the single Womanizer off her properly titled album , Circus .
Surprisingly , the single managed to hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 15th .
Now we all have learned over the years that talentless music artists like Britney do n’t make their money from album sales , etc , but from shaking their thang at concerts .
Unfortunately for Britney , her dance skills have deteriorated as much as her A - list celebrity status .
Just check out this recent performance at a German Awards
Show where she lip - syncs while flailing her arms .
Where are the rocking dance moves ?
I ’ll tell you where it is not – at this awards show .
If this is all that Britney can muster to get her career back on track , she might as well stay chunky , declare bankruptcy and retire early .
Compare it to her 2007 Video Music Awards ( VMA ) performance where she was clearly comatose while performing her single , Gimme More .
China 's latest war on porn is apparently taking down websites like the Hulk on a bad day , and it is now moving on to content available on mobile phones .
Seven governmental agencies met yesterday to discuss the progress of the Chinese attempt to crack down on Internet filth , and decided that things were going well enough that further moves into other media was the next logical step .
China 's Ministry of Public Security ( MPS ) claims to have shut down some 1,250 inappropriate websites thus far , according to a Chinese - language posting on its website .
Additionally , the MPS has arrested 41 people ( and counting ) for disseminating obscene and vulgar content .
The organization claims that , as a result of its actions , there has been a significant decrease in vulgar content online , and the online environment has been significantly improved .
But that 's not all !
The seven agencies involved agreed that one of the next steps was to start cracking down on pornographic content on mobile phones .
The statement on the MPS website did not elaborate what that would entail , but we speculate that it involves blocking the sending of mutlimedia messages , text content , and other mobile media that is deemed inappropriate .
The Chinese government has long condemned Internet pornography for " perverting China 's young minds , " which has led to its newest initiative to " purify the Internet . "
Not only is China looking at sites that host vulgar content , it also has search engines like Baidu and Google in its crosshairs ( along with 33 other search providers ) for not doing enough to block links to porn in an " efficient " manner .
While the companies may be able to reduce some of their links to the more obvious porn sites , it will be no small feat to attempt to eliminate them altogether .
The Internet moves quickly and search engines index new content almost as fast .
The same problem will undoubtedly plague whatever plans China has in mind for mobile phones as well .
Mobile content in Asia is generally several times more popular than it is here in the US , and new everything is available on a daily basis .
How exactly the MPS and other Chinese agencies plan to implement this new plan remains a mystery , but we remain skeptical that it will keep China 's young minds from being " perverted . "
Economic crisis has small car sales making a U - turn Sales of these small vehicles have fluctuated wildly in 2008 .
 -- Sales of small cars have taken the wildest ride in the auto business this year — first up , then down — and the gyrations may not be finished .
Though gas prices tumbled , some automakers are trying to juice sales of fuel - thrifty economy cars by slashing starting prices to less than $ 10,000 .
Small - car sales doubled during the first half of the year as gas topped $ 4 a gallon .
By the end of November , sales levels had tumbled 63 % from the peak .
Even with the drop , the segment is holding up better than others because overall vehicle sales are so weak .
" It 's surprising , " says Ford Motor analyst George Pipas .
No other vehicle segment saw such sales volatility in 2008 .
First , it was falling gas prices that slowed small - car sales .
Now , it 's the inability of recent college graduates and other price - conscious drivers to qualify for loans .
" The credit market is squeezing first - time buyers out .
They are getting laid off and being exposed to the economy more than others in their careers , " says General Motors spokesman John McDonald .
In the early part of the year , automakers responded to rising demand for economy cars by trying to produce more .
Ford , for instance , announced it would add another shift to the Wayne , Mich. , plant that makes its small Focus model .
Those plans were later quietly dropped .
Economy cars were smacked by a " perfect storm " — frenzied demand that depleted inventories , cheaper gas and the credit crunch , says Dave Zuchowski , sales vice president for Hyundai .
Even now , despite the sales drop , dealers do n't have droves of small cars sitting around for long .
They spend an average of 36 days on the lot , compared with 83 days for all cars and trucks last month , says Power Information Network .
With the recession making cars harder to afford , automakers are looking to price - cutting to attract buyers .
Nissan struck first in October , offering a new version of its smallest model , the Versa , with a less powerful engine and fewer features .
It was priced at $ 9,990 .
It did n't remain the " lowest - priced new car in the U.S. , " as Nissan billed it at the time , for long .
Hyundai cut the price of its Accent hatchback by $ 1,775 to $ 9,970 .
That 's $ 20 cheaper than the Versa .
The move may pressure other automakers to make their economy cars even more economical .
Following are excerpts from an interview with Yemeni cleric Abd Al - Majid Al - Zindani , which aired on Iqra TV on October 23 , 2008 :
Abd Al - Majid Al - Zindani : Allah said , with regard to women bearing witness : " If two men are not available , then a man and two women , such as you choose as witnesses , so that if one of them errs , the other can remind her . "
Some heretics – communists and other atheists – ridiculed [ this verse ] , saying :
How come a man 's testimony equals that of two women ?
They used this to mock [ the Muslims ] .
The Muslims used to respond that women are subject to menstruation , when their endurance and mental capacity for concentration are diminished .
When a woman witnesses a killing or an accident , she becomes frightened , moves away , and sometimes even faints , and she cannot even watch the incident .
[...]
The American Time magazine , in its July 31 , 1995 issue , published this picture from research about the brain functioning of men and women .
This is the ma ...
This is the female brain , and this is an image of the male brain .
What do we see ?
We find that in the case of women , this area ...
And there is another here ...
Two areas in a woman 's brain are activated when she talks .
As we can see , there are many centers of speech in a woman 's brain .
There is a center in each lobe , while in the case of a man , there is only one center , here .
The opposite center does not operate during speech , because it is busy remembering .
Both men and women have centers for speech and for memory .
In the case of men , the center for speech is here , while the center for memory is here .
When a man talks , his center for speech is active , and when he remembers something , his center for memory is active .
On the other hand , when a woman wants to talk , she puts both centers into action .
This may give us an explanation why women are more talkative .
What is the outcome of this ?
When a woman talks , she uses the part of the brain that contains the memory , because in the case of women , both centers function for speech and memory .
So when a woman talks , she might use the part of the brain containing the memory for talking – and that 's it , the data is lost .
Therefore , if we need the testimony of women in cases pertaining to human lives , property , honor , or the stability of justice , we must take into consideration this fact of life in the nature of women .
Finally , we ’re getting closer to a consumer - level 3D Printer .
This model , called the Matrix , is made by UK company Mcor and crafts intricate three - dimensional objects using nothing more than cheap sheets of standard A4 paper and glue .
The cost savings over plaster modeling and proprietary media are huge .
In the image above , the head comes in at € 7.20 ( $ 9.25 ) , the house € 1.20 ( $ 1.54 ) , the hand € 3.70 ( $ 4.75 ) and the teeth cost as little as € 0.63 ( 80 c ) .
You could probably do even better than this too by using scrap paper and picking up lots of regular PVA when it ’s going cheap .
Note :
You are supposed to use their “ proprietary glue ” , but seriously , how different can they be ?
Both are water - based PVA .
The printer seems almost magical , but the process really is quite simple .
Starting from the ground up , it feeds a sheet of paper and applies glue to the required areas , as dictated by your design .
It feeds another sheet on top and the excess is trimmed away with a tungsten - carbide tipped blade .
Compared to a Concrete - Jet 3D Printer , it ’s child ’s play .
Just because it uses cheap materials , does n’t mean it produces poorer results , either .
According to the company ’s PDF , the Matrix has a 2.54 times finer resolution than the current market leader , producing models that look like wood - carvings .
The initial cost of the unit is also supposed to be considerably less than other 3D printers on the market , but not quite at the desktop level just yet …unless you ’re loaded .

The Rarest & Most Valuable Nintendo Gamecube Games
Nintendo game libraries are always filled with all sorts of collectibles .
Between the cult following of the corporate brand and the fact the platforms have played underdogs at times ( especially the Gamecube ) , it ’s not a surprise that there are some treasures to be found in the Nintendo library .
Update : Prices Current as of March 2019
In stark contrast to the Cheapest Games series , this Rare & Valuable series will round up the rarest and most valuable games for a given console or handheld so you ’ll know what to look for whether you are buying or selling .
Below you will see two prices beside each title .
The first is the average daily selling price , which is typically the going rate for a game in non-ideal condition .
The second price is the highest price in the past three months for a complete , non-sealed game ( sealed prices are also listed separately if recent example exists ) .
The list is ordered by the balance of the two prices .
Note that some of these games are not rare in the sense that there are not many available , but rare relative to demand , which makes the games expensive .
Treasured Standard USA Releases
Pokemon Box : $ 140 - $ 820
Pokemon
Box is n’t a game but allows players to store and sort Pokemon from the Gameboy Advance Pokemon games .
In North America , the Pokemon Box was only sold at the Nintendo World store and online , which greatly limited its availability .
The European version was never sold in stores but available through the Nintendo of Europe loyalty program .
If you ’d like to see the full contents of the Pokemon Box , just check out this photo .
The Pokemon Box has always held its value rather well , going for $ 40 to $ 65 back in 2011 and the breaking into our Top 10 of this guide back in 2013 in the $ 65 to $ 183 range .
But the resurgence of the Pokemon franchise , thanks to Pokemon Go seems to really made a difference .
Pokemon
Go now has beaten out some strong competition to top our North American release list .
Mint copies may be approaching the $ 1000 range before too long if demand stay strong !

Gotcha Force : $ 90 -$ 565
In the peak of the Gamecube ’s hype Capcom was touting a handful of exclusive [ at least intended at first ] titles for the Cube that would complement Nintendo ’s offerings nicely .
The Capcom Five got a lot of buzz in 2002 and 2003 .
While some of them later received ports after the Gamecube struggled to battle the PS2 and Xbox , Capcom added another interesting exclusive in the form of Gotcha Force at the tail end of 2003 .
Gotcha Force was hybrid of a fighting and third - person shooter that has a youthful appeal with its like - Pokemon - with - robots approach ( without RPG grinding ) .
Upon release , the game received mixed reviews from critics — often due from a lack of depth .
However , it did find its fans and has become a bit of a cult classic .
The game did n’t have a rather limited print run , but due to stronger popularity in Japan , Capcom did a second print run for the region years later in 2012 .
No such luck for North America .
Gotcha
Force has never really been easy to find , but you could usually pick it up for about $ 20 through 2012 ( Our 2011 guide had it marked at $ 10 to $ 23 ) .
Our 2013 guide revision showed it starting its climb in the $ 37 to $ 70 range .
It ’s been a rather steady climb since then until it became the most valuable standard North American retail release for the Gamecube .

Metroid Prime & Zelda Wind Waker Combo : $ 145 -$ 300
This Pack - In Combo Disc was exclusive to a special console bundle that was only available during the 2005 holiday shopping season .
Unlike most pack - in games , this Metroid Prime / Wind Waker combo did have a full game case and there are actually still sealed copies out there .
For those that are curious , the case is filled with two of the Gamecube mini-DVDs — they are n’t actually combined on one disc .
I ’ve heard many people pass by this pack - in release in used game store in years passed because it did n’t look especially attractive .
Now that collectors have been well aware of it , there are many instances of regret .
Our 2013 guide showed a range pf $ 150 to $ 200 for this variation .
So , overall , it has been just a subtle but gradual increase over the last six years , it can be slightly easier to find a low - end copy for a bit less cash .

NCAA College Basketball 2K3 : $ 150 - $ 250 ( $ 1500 Sealed )
This is arguably the hardest retail Gamecube game to find in the wild .
While the platform did get some initial sports game support from Sega , the Gamecube was never much of a go - to for genre — that typically went to the Xbox and PS2 grows .
Sega was far along in development on their NCAA Basketball 2K3 production to warrant publishing , albeit in limited quantities .
They had slightly higher hopes , but they ended up stopping production mid-way and halting the 2 K sports series on the Gamecube altogether .
Between our guide revisions in both 2011 and 2013 , NCAA 2K3 stayed rather steady in the $ 40 to $ 110 range , but has since picked up a lot of steam .

Cubivore : $ 75 -$ 310
This bizarre but charming action adventure game based on gobbling up things in your environment to grow and evolve was actually developed by Nintendo with the Nintendo 64DD in mind , but eventually moved it to the Gamecube when the 64’s add - on did n’t succeed .
Nintendo was n’t actually interested in publishing the game outside of Japan , but Altus picked up the publishing rights to the game and localized it themselves .
Cubivore was actually one of the hardest Gamecube games to find originally , but Altus decided to do an additional print run down the line without having any indicators of the second print run .
Any collectors that already had the game were rather annoyed at the time .
In fact , even in 2011 , the gamer could be found in the $ 30 to $ 47 range .
By 2013 , it jumped to $ 39 to $ 91 .
Since then , every Gamecube collector has been on the prowl for it and making this climb the charts .

Disney Sports Basketball : $ 60 -$ 245
While the Gamecube was n’t known as a consoles to find lots of sports games , it did have the reputation in its early years being the console for the younger demographic .
Disney and Konami apparently thought that this would be an opportunity to fill in the sports gap with a title that would appeal to kids and benefit from the strong Disney license .
Unfortunately , Konami ’s efforts did n’t translate well into a compelling experience or respectable sales .
It did have some NBA Jam - inspired gameplay and a nice visual presentation , but that just was n’t enough to do the trick .
In our our earlier guides , this game barely registered despite its rarity .
You could easily find Disney Sports Basketball for between $ 10 and $ 30 through 2015 .
The collecting crowd finally caught on in 2017 , when it started hitting its current range .

Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Plus $ 80 - $ 230 ( $ 300 Sealed )
After an ambitious attempt to make the Dreamcast the next - gen console for online gameplay , Sega brought its MMOPRG to the Gamecube .
It received diehard support and limited commercial success .
This particular release is a re-release of Episodes I & II that fixed a few bugs in the initial release and added a few extra areas .
While these improvements were admirable , the audience was limited due to the Gamecube requiring a separate network adapter and only so many people that wanted to upgrade from the original release .
( Episodes I and II were also ported to the more online - friendly Xbox )
The original Ep I & II release used to rank fairly high on this list , but has n’t appreciated in value much at all over the years like many of its peers .
The Plus Edition , however has seen a gradual increase over the years .
2011 saw it in the $ 55 to $ 130 range and 2013 increase to the $ 75 to $ 154 range .
Pristine copies since then have seen the biggest uptick over the last six years .

Fire Emblem : Path of Radiance : $ 80 - $ 200 ( $ 250 Sealed )
This challenging strategy series finally made its way out of Japan on both the Game Boy Advance and the Gamecube while building a small but loyal following in the States ( although including Fire Emblem ’s Marth in Smash Bros Melee could have helped as well ) .
Path of Radiance was released in rather small quantities in North America as the Gamecube was on its final legs in 2005 .
Path of Radiance held its resale value solidly from the time of its retail release .
While it was n’t quite one of the most in - demand titles in 2011 , it gradually rose to the $ 34 to $ 77 range .
However , but 2013 , it had doubled to a $ 77 to $ 150 range in just two years ’ time .
However , in these last six years , we have seen much more modest growth .

Sonic Adventure 2 Pack : $ 150 – $ 200
This special retail package featured Players Choice ( Greatest Hits ) editions of both Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle inside one special outer cardboard box .
There ’s nothing special about the games and primary cases inside that box compared to their normal Players Choice editions .
So most of this limited editions ’ value lays in that extra outer cardboard box .
This setup is really hard to find on eBay , let alone in the wild .
There was one sold in 2016 for about $ 165 , but we have ’t seen one like it since .
It ’s also worth mentioning that with it featuring a cardboard box , it ’s quite challenging to find one without at least a bit of wear around the edges .
Interestingly enough , we ’ve also seen an auction this past December with Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle supposedly factory sealed together in a similar manner but without the outer cardboard box .
It did not find a buyer for $ 145 , but has been relisted for $ 140 .

Go Go Hypergrind : $ 50 - $ 200 ( $ 275 Sealed )
Altus - published games have been increasingly a common occurrence in our most valuable guide rankings .
Go Go Hypergrind , however is not their typical RPG fare .
Instead , this game is a cell - shaded skateboarding game in collaboration with animation studio Spümcø of Ren & Stimpy fame ( interestingly the game was released just two years before the animation studio shut down ) .
Instead of trying to perform tricks “ flawlessly ” , players are encouraged turn “ tricks ” into wacky cartoon mishaps and eventually learning to chain those into combos .
Even though the game was developed by be that was developed by Team Poponchi at Atlus Japan , the game never was actually released in Japan .
The game received mixed reviews and remained in obscurity ( and a $ 8 to $ 12 price range ) up until mid 2016 when collectors started taking notice of it being an Altus production and wanted to add it to their Gamecube libraries at increasing premiums .
By mid 2017 , collectors were looking at a $ 42 to $ 100 price range .

Skies of Arcadia Legends : $ 65 - $ 110 ( $ 145 Sealed )
Solid RPGs often have a strong presence on these Rare and Valuable guides .
Skies of Arcadia was originally one of the few great RPGs on the Sega Dreamcast , but this enhanced version eventually made its way to the Gamecube as well .
Both consoles ended up being commercial disappointments , but that almost creates even more of a sense of collectibility for games like this .
Skies of Arcadia Legends rose quickly up this years a few years back , but its relatively availability has kept it from getting too high on this list .
While it nearly tripled in value between 2011 ( $ 27 to $ 63 ) and 2013 ( $ 66 to $ 137 ) , it has stayed relatively stable in value over the last six years .

Melee is one of the very best - selling games in the Gamecube library , so it is not rare by any means .
However , most of the game ’s sales are of the “ Nintendo Choice ” ( Greatest Hits ) with the yellow stripe on the packaging .
Many collectors and Nintendo fans prefer to have the original , Black Box box release of their favorites , so this one carries premium — ESPECIALLY when is complete and mint .
With Melee being one of the favorite installments in the famed Smash franchise ( and used heavily in tournament play ) , Melee always commands some cash no matter what .

Ikaruga : $ 40 - $ 92 ( $ 120 Sealed )
This legendary 2D shooter began with hype early on as Treasure ’s follow - up to their legendary shmup , Radiant Silvergun from the arcade and Sega Saturn .
Originating in the arcade and being brought to Sega ’s Dreamcast in Japan , Ikaruga was praised by shmup fans and highly collectable from the start .
Considering the genre was rather niche and the Gamecube was a bit of a niche console itself , it was a bit surprising that not only would Ikaruga be ported to the Gamecube , but it would also get a North American release .
Since then , we ’ve seen Ikaruga also be remade in full HD on the Xbox 360 ’s XBLA and the Nintendo Switch , but this Gamecube version remains as the only physical release that was sold in North America .
( And the Dreamcast ’s version is the only other physical release worldwide )

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama has picked GOP Rep . Ray LaHood of Illinois to be his nominee for transportation secretary , two sources told CNN on Wednesday .
Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois would be the second Republican in Obama 's Cabinet .
Two Democratic sources also said Obama will tap Mary Schapiro to head the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Schapiro is CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , the largest nongovernment regulator for all securities firms doing business with the U.S. public .
She is a former SEC commissioner and served as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994 during the Clinton Administration .
Obama will formally announce his choice of LaHood , a seven - term congressman from Peoria , at a press conference in Chicago on Thursday morning , the sources said .
LaHood is well - respected by Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill .
One of LaHood 's closest friends in Congress , fellow Illinois Republican Tim Johnson , said LaHood " has the ability to work both sides of the aisle well " and called him " an extraordinarily talented legislator . "
Obama has so far chosen one other Republican for his Cabinet .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates will stay on in the Obama administration .
Earlier on Wednesday , Obama announced former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack as his choice for agriculture secretary and Colorado Sen.
Ken Salazar as his choice for secretary of the interior .
" Together they will serve as guardians of the American landscape on which the health of our economy and the well - being of our families so heavily depend , " Obama said at a news conference in Chicago .
Vilsack was a high - profile supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton during the presidential primaries after he briefly sought the Democratic presidential nomination .
Vilsack has championed the development of ethanol , an alternative energy , in Iowa -- something that coincides with Obama 's vision for an energy - independent future , and something he can promote from the Department of Agriculture .
Vilsack , who dropped out of the presidential race in February 2007 , is the fourth former presidential rival to join Obama 's team .
Vice president - elect Joe Biden ; Hillary Clinton , Obama 's pick for secretary of state ; and Bill Richardson , Obama 's pick for secretary of commerce , also sought the Democratic presidential nomination .
" With the appointments I announced earlier in the week , and with those I am announcing today , I am confident that we have the team we need to make the rural agenda America 's agenda , to create millions of new green jobs , to free our nation from its dependence on oil and to help preserve this planet for our children , " Obama said .
Watch Obama name Salazar and Vilsack to his team »
Salazar , Obama 's choice for secretary of the interior , has focused on public land and energy resource issues as a first - term senator from Colorado .
He is the second Latino to be named to Obama 's Cabinet .
Obama said Wednesday he was confident that under Salazar , the Interior Department would become more proactive instead of " sitting back , waiting for whoever has most access in Washington to extract what they want . "
Salazar is a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and has developed a reputation as a strong advocate of reducing the country 's dependence on foreign oil .
A fifth - generation Coloradan , Salazar was elected to the Senate in 2004 and quickly made a name for himself in immigration reform .
He was a key member of a bipartisan Senate group that put together the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , which would have beefed up border security and increased the number of Border Patrol agents , but also would have created a guest worker program .
That program would have allowed migrants to work temporarily in the Untied States .
The most controversial aspect of the bill was the creation of a pathway to legalization and eventual citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already in the country , an idea that critics dismissed as " amnesty . "
The bill failed to make it through Congress .
Salazar 's appointment would not jeopardize the balance of power in the Senate .
Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter , a fellow Democrat , would name his replacement .

Also on Wednesday , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino announced that Obama will meet for a second time with President Bush .
The meeting also will include the three living former presidents .
President Bush will be host at a lunch with Obama and former Presidents Jimmy Carter , George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton on January 7 , Perino said .
Obama proposed the meeting with the former presidents to Bush when the two met in the Oval Office on November 10 , two sources said .
The high - powered meeting is another sign of how closely the Obama and Bush teams have been working to try to make sure the first post - 9/11 transfer of power goes smoothly .
" It 's been unbelievably cooperative , " said one Democratic official , who was not authorized to speak publicly about the conversations between Bush and Obama .
CNN 's Ed Henry , Jessica Yellin and Candy Crowley contributed to this report .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict was baptized at birth and will most likely be baptized again one year after his death , not by his Roman Catholic Church but by a Mormon he never met .

The Mormons , a U.S. - based denomination officially named the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints ( LDS ) , encourage members to baptize the dead by proxy in the belief they are helping the deceased attain full access to heaven .
Church members are told to focus on their ancestors , a rite understandable in a relatively new denomination founded in 1830 .
But so many now perform the rituals for celebrities , heroes and perfect strangers that the practice has spun out of control .
Adolf Hitler , Joseph Stalin , Genghis Khan , Mao Zedong , King Herod , Al Capone and Mickey Mouse have all appeared for a short time in the International Genealogical Index for proxy baptisms , said Helen Radkey , a researcher specialized in the IGI .
“ It seems that any kind of name at all may be submitted , ” said Radkey from Salt Lake City , where the Church is based .
The IGI also accepts names for rites that “ seal ” spouses in eternal marriage or parents and children in eternal families .
This has outraged Jews and baffled Christians who see it as usurping the memory of their departed relatives .
The Church says it cannot stem the tide of dead baptized in its own temples .
“ The only way we could prevent it would be to undertake independent genealogical research on every name that came in , an utterly impossible task with the many tens of thousands of names that are submitted each year , ” Church spokeswoman Kim Farah said in an email responding to questions from Reuters .
So Benedict looks set to join his predecessor John Paul and a centuries - long list of popes Mormons have baptized -- despite the fact that he , back when he was the Vatican ’s top doctrinal authority , ruled that Mormon baptisms were not even Christian .
“ There is no reason theologically why a former Pope or any other church leader should n’t be offered the same opportunity given to the rest of mankind , ” Farah said .
JEWS , CATHOLICS , PROTESTANTS , MUSLIMS
The Catholics are not the only non-Mormons on the Church ’s International Genealogical Index ( IGI ) , a list of those baptized or cleared for the rite in which a Mormon undergoes a full immersion baptism at a temple in the name of the dead person .
Jewish Holocaust victims , Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin and Mohammed ibn Abdel - Wahhab , founder of Saudi Arabia ’s stern version of Islam , have all popped up on the list .
A purged version of the IGI is on the Internet , at www.familysearch.org, a Web site run by the LDS church , but does not show which rites have been performed .
That data is reserved only for Mormons , who can consult it at one of the 3,400 Family History Centers worldwide where they go to enter names for these rites using special software .
The rites are then performed at temples off - limits to non-Mormons .
Radkey , who has exposed non-Mormon entries on the IGI for over a decade , alerted U.S. Jewish groups last December that the famous Jewish Nazi- hinter Simon Wiesenthal had turned up on the IGI as a departed soul cleared for Mormon baptism .
Rabbi Marvin Heir , head of a Jewish human rights group in Los Angeles named after the deceased Austrian , called this “ very offensive .
Simon Wiesenthal dedicated his whole life to Jews .
I do n’t think he needs help getting into heaven . ”
The Church pledged in 1995 not to list Holocaust victims and other Jews after many names were found on the IGI .
It took Wiesenthal ’s name off its online list but critics like Radkey say internal lists still have large numbers of Jewish names .
POPES AND FICTIONAL WIVES
Pope John Paul II was baptized not once but four times in April 2006 , in line with Mormon practice of waiting a year before starting these rites .
He died on April 2 , 2005 .
His name was purged from the online IGI , so a normal search will not find them .
But his four now - anonymous files are still in the database and three still show his parents ’ names .
Pope Pius XII was baptized three times and also “ sealed ” in eternal marriage to a fictional Mrs Eugenio Pacelli .
Saint Ignatius Loyola , founder of the Jesuit order of priests , was also “ sealed ” to a bogus wife .
Catholic clergy do not marry .
Names are purged from the public IGI after being found and publicized .
Pope John Paul I and Pope Paul VI were both baptized and were listed on the online IGI in December but removed after Reuters asked about them , Farah confirmed .
But earlier popes , going back at least to the Crusader Pope Urban II ( 1088 - 1099 ) , are mostly still there .
“ They remove any names that could potentially cause criticism , ” Radkey said .
Father Thomas Weinandy , head of the Secretariat for Doctrine and Pastoral Practices of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , described proxy baptism as inappropriate .
“ We do n’t know whether the person would want this or not , ” he told Reuters from Washington .
“ Catholics and other Christians feel they are already properly baptized .
But it ’s harmless .
“ As for the popes , I think most Catholics would find that somewhat inappropriate but also rather humorous .
They ’re already in heaven !
So it ’s redundant , even if it did work . ”
BAFFLING NOTION
Mormons believe the early Christians strayed from the true faith and only the LDS Church returned to the right path .
All those who lived before 1830 were thus unable to join the Church and have full access to all the glory of heaven .
To trace and baptize these people , it has built up the largest genealogical library in the world , the Family History Library at its headquarters in Salt Lake City , Utah .
This includes public lists of names collected around the world .
Clearly sensitive to questions about the practice , the LDS Church defends it as a central tenet of its faith .
It argues the proxy baptism does no harm because the dead can reject it in the next life , a notion baffling to most Christians .
Farah said Mormons were “ always deeply saddened to hear ” that non-Mormons might be offended to find their ancestors ’ names had been harvested from public lists and baptized into a faith they did not follow during their lives .
Church rules say deceased who were born in the past 95 years should not be submitted for baptism without permission from their living relatives , but the IGI shows this is often ignored .
Farah said the LDS Church has tried to discourage abuse of the system .
“ We continue to look for ways to improve , ” she said .
But the market is a terrible place to be and it happens to be the place where Mr. Cramer day trades on his persona .
He still appears on television screens at a camera - ready desk that is decorated by a herd of animal figurines .
The bulls still outnumber the bears by two to one  there are a few pigs thrown in for good measure  but the man who sits behind it and rants knows better .
He is not predicting that the bottom has arrived or will be here any time soon .
“ Can we have the recession first before we decide that we ’ve found the bottom ? ” he said .
“ I want to see the things that typically happen in a recession before we say it ’s the bottom , and then I will be more positive . ”
On Friday ’s show , one of his featured stocks was Watsco , a heating and ventilation company that was paying out decent dividends as its stock sunk along with the rest of the market .
“ This company is paying you to wait for the bottom , ” he said with his characteristic gusto as he stalked the Steadicam in studio .
Later in the same show , he suggested that “ this is a time when you try to hunker down and lose less than the other guys . ”
It makes for a far less festive hour with a manic guy who treats the camera as an opponent in a wrestling match .
( CNBC has a content - sharing agreement with The New York Times . )
On “ Mad Money ” he now makes fewer recommendations and is hitting the button marked “ House of Pain ” a lot more often than the one marked “ House of Pleasure , ” but tearing the horns off a bull does not make it any more relevant to an economy rendered in fragile china .
Mr. Cramer will never be Suze Orman , telling you how to carefully handle the money you have left .
He is a blue sky kind of guy , a creature of a fast - fading era .
The viewers still shout “ Booyah , ” when they call in , but nobody , including Mr. Cramer , is feeling it .

But while the real estate is ancient , the kids are thoroughly modern .
So engrossed were these kids in the four screens they were watching ( Grand Theft Auto , Grand Theft Auto , Grand Theft Auto , and Tekken Tag ) that they did n’t notice us taking pictures .
And unlike every other kid we ran across in the city , they did n’t mug our camera when they did finally spot us ; instead , they just went back to the game .
Earlier in the day , we ’d come across a wedding procession — dancing men , a blushing groom , drums , and a brass band blaring off - key fanfares — making its way through the narrow lanes to some lucky bride ’s house .
Having given up music when I moved to India , I wanted to grab the trombone , learn the simple licks , and join in the fun .
And now , coming across the gamers , I felt the same longing .
I wanted to put my two - rupee coin on the counter ( a coin close enough in size to the quarter that the metallic thunk on the clear plastic surface might feel as satisfying ) and get my turn to kick ass .
But I was never any good at Tekken .

If you have ever been curious in regards to what appears as camera housing situated in public places , you may be amazed that a variety of them are part of the Homeland Security camera system network .
Not all of these cameras , and not in all cities and towns are part of it , yet an ever increasing number of cameras that are in existence in the majority of cities are joining forces with different government agencies in their ongoing fight against domestic terrorism .
There have been numerous cities that have installed cameras to maintain close surveillance on big public assemblies , for instance the White House as well as around various national memorials and monuments to help identify difficulties with crowds .
The capability to have these cameras networked together into a much bigger , national type of network is giving the Homeland Security Camera System the ability to grow through the use of extra cameras from communities all around the country .
For people who do n’t comprehend that this is possible , think for a moment of the internet ’s availability to access your personal computer from anyplace on the planet by simply signing onto a computer and then going to a website on the network .
Begin at your home network , if there is more than one computer that is connected to internet access by way of a hub , you have the capability of get access to anything on one computer from any other computer , if in fact you have the right authorization .
If for example you have cameras that are connected to a network at your office , then access the work computer from your house , you can then bring up images connected to your work computer from your house .
This is a similar system that the Homeland Security Camera system utilizes to add additional cameras and resources onto their existing systems .
Surveillance System Rapidly Growing In Size
Because the infrastructure is already in place in many of the larger communities , it is actually a simply task for the Homeland Security camera computer to connect to the city camera computer and get access to the images of that computer .
Certainly , you have to have permission that is granted by the community for the Homeland Security camera system to take the images from the computer .
Safeguards are also put in place to stop the homeland computer from getting any type of control over a communities camera system .
The majority of Homeland Security cameras that are being utilized are not just static types of cameras .
There are numerous types that are equipped with accessibility through remote means so that they can pan , zoom and tilt to more effectively monitor people or events that are within viewing range to assist in fighting the possible threat of either domestic or global terrorism .
While there are people that are not comfortable with knowing that the local and federal government can hook into any community that they want with a camera system and snatch up images from anywhere , the majority of people realize the significance of having a constant vigil for the purpose of national security .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -
They may seem like paradise to those trying to escape bitter cold , but warm - weather cities can make for a pretty lousy climate for business , at least according to a MarketWatch survey .
Six out of the 10 worst metro areas for business are warm - weather cities , including two cities in California and one each in Arizona , Florida , Texas and Louisiana .
Take into account the bottom 20 , and 11 of those are warm - weather towns .
One reason is the bursting of the real - estate bubble .
The linchpin for much of the nation 's current economic turmoil took a toll on sunny regions where speculators invaded the market and kept flipping properties .
That was especially true in the twin cities of Tampa - St.
Petersburg , the only new entry to the bottom 10 list this year .
Area economists now say that 2009 will be a " lost year " economically because of it .
" You can just write it off right now , " said Sean Snaith , director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida .
In fact , Miami was close to making the bottom 10 this year for many of the same reasons .
In many ways , however , the inherent problems confronting the rest of the bottom 10 remain until the regions find ways to pull themselves up - cold regions that relied heavily on industry and have yet to adapt to new economic realities .
MarketWatch studied the nation 's 50 biggest metro areas using a variety of data from multiple sources , and compared them against each other .
Starting with the worst , the bottom 10 this year are :
50 . New Orleans - 62 points :
The Big Easy had an even rougher year than last , as the region still struggles to recover from the effects of Hurricane Katrina .
But with only two Fortune 1000 companies , no Forbes private companies , one S&P company and three Russell firms , the region was crippled from the start .
New Orleans would have improved its odds had mining concern Freeport McMoRan FCX , - 3.64 % not left for the Phoenix area .
The figures will only get worse for small business when new data is released next year , since the census bureau 's data only covers up to 2005 .
A large portion of the small - business community was devastated when Katrina struck in September of that year .
While many residents still are not living within the Orleans Parish , they have crowded into other nearby parishes , making the metro region close in population to what it was prior to Katrina .
49 . Buffalo - 80 points :
This upstate New York region does suffer from the ill effects of cold weather , and the fact that many of its mainstay heavy industries fell by the wayside .
Buffalo tumbled by 46 total points and thus fell two places in the rankings .
It nearly beat out New Orleans for the bottom spot as well .
Buffalo's rankings in many of the business metrics stayed consistent , but much of its slide was due primarily to a statistical anomaly last year .
It ranked high in job growth as it managed - up to that point in the decade - to add a small number of jobs despite losing population .
This year , however , that job growth figure turned negative and Buffalo slid to the bottom 10 in that category .
48 . Tucson - 111 points :
This southern Arizona city is the smallest of the 50 metro areas surveyed , but some there think it 's getting a raw deal .
Sure , there are virtually no businesses that locate there - Freeport McMoRan is a prime example of a company that chose Phoenix instead when it moved from New Orleans .
The city has no public or private firms on the Fortune , Forbes or S&P lists .
It lost two of its Russell 2000 companies in the last year , helping it to drop nine points in its overall score .
Further , it ranked second - worst in the small - business category .
But Tucson ranked in the top 10 in the jobless category , and in the top third in population growth , all of which helped it to remain in the same ranking as last year .
A sizable military and aerospace presence has helped the region prosper along with tourism , and kept its jobless rate low .
But it could face trouble should either of those two industries stumble , says Marshall J. Vest , economist at the University of Arizona 's Eller College of Management .
" That 's what drives the Tucson economy , " he said .
" It 's not very well diversified . "
The region 's population has swelled in recent years as retirees continue to gather there .
And year - round living is becoming more attractive as Tucson 's climate is somewhat more moderate than Phoenix's .
Its higher elevation keeps the city about 5 - 10 degrees cooler .
That has n't helped , however , when it comes to attracting new companies , Vest says .
" If a company is looking to expand in Arizona , they 're going to look at Phoenix first , " he said .
47 . Sacramento - 120 points :
A loss of eight points translated to a drop by one spot for California 's capital , and the state 's fourth - largest metro area .
A growing population , coupled with a continuing dearth of big employers , worked against the city , which often gets overshadowed by Los Angeles , San Francisco and San Diego .
Sacramento was in the top 10 in both population growth and job growth , but the positions it added were n't enough to keep it out of the bottom 10 in the unemployment rankings .
Sacramento has one company on the Fortune list , McClatchy Newspapers MNI .
It also has two Forbes companies , Raley 's grocery stores and Pacific Coast Building Products .
It added one Russell 2000 company to the mix as well .
46 . Rochester - 134 points : Another upstate New York city in the bottom 10 , Rochester did manage to gain 20 points and three spots up the ladder .
And it was all due to one company being added to its roster of Forbes private companies .
Bausch & Lomb was new to the list this year after the eye - care company turned private .
That , coupled with Rochester 's relatively small population , was enough to change its ratio in that category and shoot it up 19 spots in that category .
Rochester has a number of legacy companies such as Eastman Kodak EK and Constellation Brands STZ , +1.11 % .
But it remains low in the rankings for population and job growth .
44 ( tie ) Tampa - St. Petersburg - 137 points :
The housing bubble took a steep toll on Florida , and wreaked havoc on the Tampa - St .
Pete region 's business and job picture in particular .
The area 's score dropped by a whopping 55 points and it plunged 14 spots down the overall list .
It lost ground on the Fortune and Forbes lists , as two companies fell off from each .
Tampa-St. Pete , however , fell sharpest in the small - business category .
While the MarketWatch study expanded the data used to develop rankings in small business , the new criteria was n't the only reason for the drop , says the University of Central Florida 's Snaith .
" Its biggest problem is it's in Florida right now , " Snaith said .
Housing speculators have left the region reeling , with only Miami feeling the pinch worse , and the effects from that extended to small business .
It probably will only get worse as newer data come in .
Tampa - St. Pete dropped 18 points down in the small - business rankings , second only to Miami's 20 - point plunge .
Miami just missed being put in the bottom 10 as it dropped 40th place in the overall rankings .
44 ( tie ) Los Angeles - 137 points :
The City of Angels stayed virtually in the same place ( it was 45th last year ) with an identical score .
L.A. suffers from the same troubles it has for nearly two decades : a vast metropolitan area with few corporations located there ever since the aerospace industry took a dive .
It also slipped several spaces in the small - business rankings .
L.A. does appear , though , to be moving up the ranks with newer companies as it climbed a few spots in the Russell category .
L.A. does appear to be adding more jobs , climbing several spots in the job - growth category .
42 ( tie ) Virginia Beach - 139 points : Much like Los Angeles , the region deals largely in trade and tourism , and actually ranked third in the job - growth category this year , claiming that same spot again .
But it lost several spots in the Fortune and Forbes categories , contributing largely to its 18 - point drop in overall score .
Virginia Beach also has four military bases , which helped keep the region 's jobless rate low , and the city at the same overall ranking as last year .
42 ( tie ) Detroit - 139 points : Motor City may fall rapidly once the automotive industry shakeout is complete , but for now it keeps the same score , and moves up two spots by not losing any ground .
The city continues to suffer from a lack of business diversity , and it showed more than ever in its unemployment numbers .
Detroit moved down one spot in both the jobless and job - growth categories , and now ranks dead last in each .
41 . San Antonio - 149 points :
Texas 's third - largest city slipped slightly in overall score - by four points - but it gained two spots in the rankings since it did n't slip as much as others .
The city competes with larger cities within the state for businesses , and usually does n't win out .
But people keep flocking to the region , and it manages to stay in the top half in unemployment and job - growth rankings .
Like Virginia Beach , it has four military bases , a fair amount of tourism aided by the Alamo and River Walk , and Toyota 's truck - making plant to enrich the region with jobs .
Other warm - weather towns in bottom half :
In addition to Miami , which ranked 40th , Las Vegas , Orlando , San Diego and Phoenix were in the 31 - 40 spots .
Another Texas town , Austin , was 28th .
The two fastest - growing cities in the nation , however , improved their lots .
Top - grower Las Vegas moved out of the bottom 10 to reach the 38th spot .
And Phoenix , second - fastest on that list , climbed four spots to reach 31st place .

Beyoncé may be an international sensation married to hip - hop star Jay Z , says Tom Horan in the London Daily Telegraph , but she had a remarkably sheltered upbringing .
Raised in a middle - class suburb of Houston by strict parents , the 27 - year - old singer - actress attended private school and rarely dated .
“ People would be surprised as to the lack of experiences I ’ve had , ” she says .
“ When I was 12 , 13 , I had my first boyfriend till I was 17 .
I went to his prom , but I had to be home early .
We did n’t — you know .
My mom and dad , they were n’t having it . ”
After Beyoncé achieved early success as a 19 - year - old with the group Destiny ’s Child , her parents made sure stardom did n’t go to her head .
“ We were in a record store , and my song was playing , and I started singing , ” she recalls .
“ And there were some really cute guys talking to me and I was like , ‘ Oh yeah !
I ’m hot !’
And my mom said , ‘ I ’m talking to you , ’ but I kept singing .
And so she slapped me in the face !
My dad said , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
My mom said , ‘ She thinks she ’s hot stuff ’cos her single is out .
You are still my child .
Now go and sit in the car . ’
It was the best thing she could have ever done to me , because for the first time , I realized I was losing sight of what was important . ”
Warning : " Gearshift movies , " a term coined by P.T. Anderson , are films that head in one direction , stop on a dime , and veer off into radically different territory .
Since the turning point is usually a startling surprise , it should go without saying that the entries below contain major spoilers .
Proceed at your risk .

1. Psycho ( 1960 )
Imagine , for a moment , that you 'd never seen Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho , and knew nothing about it .
To really make the thought experiment work , let 's pretend you did n't even know it was called Psycho .
What kind of movie would you think you were watching for the first 40 minutes ?
Psycho at first plays like the story of a woman of limited means who makes a bad decision , then tensely lives on the outside of the law .
On the run after absconding with her boss ' money , she slowly turns into a nervous wreck .
Then she checks into a motel , meets a nice ( though slightly nervous ) young man , and comes to a decision :
She will right her wrongs and return the money .
But first , a nice shower …
At which point Psycho throws out its carefully constructed moral drama and enters a place where personal values and tough choices get destroyed by insanity that lets life bleed down the drain .
It also abandons its seeming protagonist to a grisly fate , revealing that the story was never really about her at all .
2. Audition ( 1999 )
As with Psycho , the ideal way to experience Audition is to know absolutely nothing about it going in — not the genre , not the director , and certainly not any plot developments beyond the most basic synopsis .
And even then , you have to be the sort of person who can stomach a movie this graphic , though knowing you need a strong stomach spoils the movie a little , too .
The last third of Audition is what shocks most viewers , but fans of extreme J- horror maestro Takashi Miike are probably more shocked by the first third , which tells the story of a lonely widower with a restraint more common to a Yasujiro Ozu movie .
When the man uses his post in a film - production office to " cast " a potential future wife , he finds the demure young woman of his dreams .
Then , in one shot involving a telephone and the contents of a giant burlap sack on her apartment floor , the genre , the tone , and the audience 's expectations all abruptly change .
3. Death Proof ( 2007 )
Going into Death Proof , the hot - rod half of the Quentin Tarantino / Robert Rodriguez exploitation epic Grindhouse , it 's pretty obvious that the movie is going have fast cars , sexy women , and a few violent intersections of the two .
What comes as a shock is that the beautiful , charming ladies Tarantino dotes on at the beginning of the movie — dwelling on their conversations , and taking time to show them downing shots and dancing to songs on a barroom jukebox — are n't picked off one by one , with the survivors allowed to develop as characters as they struggle over time .
Instead , they 're abruptly killed en masse in a single terrifying act of vehicular homicide by psychopath " Stuntman Mike , " played by Kurt Russell .
It only appears that Tarantino is introducing us to the main characters ; in reality , he 's establishing his killer 's M.O. , which a different group of women will thwart in Death Proof 's second half .
4. Sunrise : A Song Of Two Humans ( 1927 )
F.W. Murnau 's stark morality tale , one of the great achievements of the silent era , opens with a married man from the sticks ( credited simply as " The Man , " alongside " The Wife , " " The Maid , " et al. ) sneaking off to see a foul temptress from the city .
As they share intimacies under the moonlight , The Woman From The City convinces The Man to murder his wife and run off with her instead .
But at the very moment he 's about to drown
The Wife , he recognizes his madness and has a sudden change of heart .
From there , Sunrise quickly shifts to what amounts to a second honeymoon between man and wife , a delirious trip to the city that 's a radical break from what has transpired before .
But viewers can't forget so easily , and the revival of this moribund marriage carries a tension that would n't have been possible without the opening act .
5. Boogie Nights ( 1997 )
P.T. Anderson put his love of gearshift movies into action with Boogie Nights , his sprawling portrait of the porn industry in the ' 70s and ' 80s , and the surrogate family of fucked - up stars and filmmakers caught up in its ebb and flow .
Anderson shows an obvious affection for way things were done in the ' 70s , before hippie permissiveness ran smack into Reagan - era moral reactionaries , and before the video age laid waste to porn producers striving for some measure of artistic legitimacy .
The difference between the two decades could n't be drawn more sharply :
As midnight approaches at a New Year 's Eve party in 1979 , with news of video 's imminent rise already tarnishing the atmosphere , a despondent crew member , finally driven to the brink by his wife 's infidelities , pulls out a gun .
Blam !
It 's the ' 80s .
The good times are over .

6. Something Wild ( 1986 )
Jonathan Demme's Something
Wild has been around long enough now that people forget exactly how shocking it was when it was released .
The story of dull , predictable banker Jeff Daniels and his whirlwind fling with free spirit Melanie Griffith starts out as a distinctly postmodern twist on the classic screwball comedy ; as Griffith drags the stuck - in - a - rut Daniels along to her high - school reunion , Demme treats viewers to some fine comedic dialogue , memorable setpieces , terrific music , and unforgettable character - driven humor .
But it 's the jarring turn the movie takes once they get there that makes Something Wild truly special , drawing critical comparisons at the time to 1986's other great convention - twister , Blue Velvet .
Ray Liotta , in one of his first film roles , appears as Griffith 's steel - eyed , psychotic ex , and , as the film takes an intense turn into darkness , Demme ups the ante , showing the thin line between quirky and crazy and taking the audience on a jittery emotional ride that 's entirely unexpected , given the film 's kooky beginnings .
7. GoodFellas ( 1990 )
Martin Scorsese 's modern gangster - movie classic follows three full decades in the life of Henry Hill ( Ray Liotta ) , who got involved with the Italian mob as a teenager in '50s Brooklyn and stayed with them until 1980 , when he testified against his former bosses in court and went into witness protection .
Throughout GoodFellas , Scorsese covers the passage of time in sweeping cinematic terms , wending through the key events and anecdotes that best evoke Henry 's time with the mob and his eventual undoing .
But then , on the fateful day of May 11 , 1980 , which ended with Hill 's capture by FBI agents , Scorsese abruptly throws on the brakes .
Gone are the majestic tracking shots and ' 50s pop standards that drew viewers into the mob lifestyle so seductively ; they 're replaced by a jittery style that mirrors the coke - fueled paranoia of Henry 's last day - in - the - life as a free man .
He has to pick up his brother from the hospital , arrange a deal with some shady associates from Atlanta , come back home to stir the sauce for dinner … and hey , see that helicopter circling overhead ?
8. Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 )
Stanley Kubrick 's drastic change of tone a third of the way through Full Metal Jacket was n't just a filmmaking choice ; he was faithfully following the shift in style and mood of his source material , Gustav Hasford 's novel The Short - Timers .
Both begin by bluntly , ominously cataloguing the breaking down of Marine Corps recruits at boot camp , and their subsequent rebuilding as killers .
Even so , there 's a congenial undercurrent to their training ; the film pushes its audience to feel pride when Private " Gomer Pyle " overcomes his shortcomings , and to find goodwill toward Gunnery Sgt. Hartman for the brand of tough love that facilitates it .
Then things go way too far in a hurry : A demented Pyle guns Hartman down , and the rest of the movie spirals into a chaotic chronicle of the insanity of the Vietnam War .
The abrupt switch in direction is part of the point :
Becoming a soldier and fighting a war is a rapid about - face in reality .
9. Lost Highway †( 1997 )
David Lynch 's Lost Highway †begins as a creepy take on modern noir , as jazz musician Bill Pullman finds a physical manifestation for his paranoia , in the form of a ghoulish visitor ( Robert Blake ) who taunts him with tidbits of forbidden knowledge about his possibly unfaithful wife ( Patricia Arquette ) .
The sequence builds to a seemingly murderous climax that lands Pullman in jail .
But then the film seems to sidetrack to a pocket universe in which Balthazar Getty replaces Pullman as the protagonist , and winds up in another sort of noir , where Arquette plays a femme fatale whose attraction to Getty puts him at odds with local mobster Robert Loggia .
As the film progresses , it becomes clear that the two stories have elements in common , if they 're different at all .
Lynch pulled off a similar trick even more successfully , though no less mysteriously , in 2001 's Mulholland Dr. , using the leftover bits of a failed TV pilot as the foundation for a nightmare about the dreams we let Hollywood create for us , and the way those dreams sometimes eat us alive .
10 . In The Bedroom ( 2001 )
For most of the way , Todd Field 's debut feature , expanded from an Andre Dubus short story , is about the wreckage a death causes in a seemingly healthy marriage .
In the early going , Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek are united in wanting better things for their son Nick Stahl , who 's decided to marry a single mother ( Marisa Tomei ) they feel is beneath his social station .
But when Tomei 's pathological ex-husband kills Stahl in a domestic dispute , Wilkinson and Spacek become increasingly angry — at each other , for a start , but also at the justice system that is n't working hard enough to keep the killer behind bars .
All these events spark a major implosion at home , but what follows is less expected : Wilkinson , who by every indication is a lawful man , decides to take the law into his own hands .
And just like that , a restrained domestic melodrama morphs into a soberer take on the Death Wish vigilante movie .

11 . Wild Things ( 1998 )
As gearshift movies go , the camp thriller Wild Things is a borderline case , because the huge reveal around the halfway mark could be called a twist rather than a radical shift in tone .
After all , here 's a movie that keeps piling on twist after twist , right through the closing credits .
Yet consider this :
As an audience , we have every reason to trust that Matt Dillon 's character — a teacher falsely accused of sexual assault by two different students ( Denise Richards and Neve Campbell ) — is a wronged man , right up through a criminal trial that completely falls apart .
But when it 's revealed , via an infamous three - way , that all parties were in cahoots all along , the filmmakers pull the rug out from under the audience , and suddenly the movie is down a straitlaced protagonist .
12 . The Ninth Configuration ( 1980 )
In this wonderful genre - defying film by Exorcist author William Peter Blatty , new psychiatrist Stacy Keach arrives at an experimental hospital for Vietnam veterans , determined to find out whether the inmates are faking their madness .
For the first hour or so , Ninth Configuration follows the path of a highbrow surrealist comedy , as Keach pushes the inmates to show their true selves , and they push back just as hard , resulting in some hilariously quotable dialogue .
But soon enough , the movie makes a tectonic shift :
Some of the inmates suspect that Keach is crazier than any of them , and when their fears are confirmed , The Ninth Configuration becomes a sort of theo - psychological thriller .
And just when all the tense confrontations and philosophical arguments over the existence of God start to get a bit much , Keach 's own true self becomes evident , in one of the most startling fight scenes of the decade .

13 . Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 )
Clint Eastwood 's Million Dollar Baby was marketed as a sort of female Rocky , and indeed , a large part of it progresses exactly like that : Hilary Swank bugs crotchety old boxing trainer Eastwood into taking her on , and once he finally does , she becomes a big - time competitor .
There 's plenty of sentimental excess tossed in — the two form an adorable father / daughter relationship , since they 're both estranged from their families — so almost everyone who did n't hear about it ahead of time was caught off - guard at the abrupt plot twist which turned a perfectly fine sports movie into a grim treatise on euthanasia .
14 . Adaptation ( 2002 )
Adaptation may be the only gearshift film that actually shows viewers the cogs as they turn , amid an abundance of bizarro self - reference .
Nicolas Cage stars as real - life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman , who 's struggling to adapt Susan Orlean 's book The Orchid Thief into this very movie .
When Charlie 's attempts to anchor the plot land him in meta - film hell , he seeks the advice of his doltish twin Donald , who 's just sold a terrible script for a cool million .
As Donald ( also played by Cage ) makes his influence felt , Adaptation undergoes its own rapid adaptation .
A barrage of clichés atomizes the dreamy , cerebral atmosphere , with Orlean ( Meryl Streep ) becoming a sex - obsessed fiend for an orchid - derived drug , and a poacher ( Chris Cooper ) blasting Donald with a shotgun before being eaten by an alligator .
15 . The Crying Game ( 1992 )
Neil Jordan 's moody 1992 thriller is one of the most - spoilered films of all time , up next to Citizen Kane , but the big reveal that made the movie infamous does n't actually mark either of the film 's major tonal turning points .
For roughly the first 40 minutes , The Crying Game is a claustrophobic , intimate little drama about a reluctant IRA agent ( Stephen Rea ) tasked with guarding a kidnapped British soldier ( Forest Whitaker ) who 's being held as a political ploy .
While Rea 's superiors try to profit from their catch , Rea gradually gets to know Whitaker , in long , quiet , private conversations held in a dilapidated greenhouse deep in the woods .
It 's the kind of story that feels like it started on the stage , as a raw , simple , deeply personal little two - man play .
Then Rea is ordered to take Whitaker into the woods and shoot him .
In the wake of Whitaker 's death — and an army sweep that leaves Rea alone and on the run — Rea retraces Whitaker 's footsteps and steps from that hushed dialogue - driven drama into a moody , dingy , music - hall romance that takes place in a far larger and more crowded world .
In essence , it becomes a neo -noir , with Jaye Davidson as the " femme " fatale leading Rea into trouble with a violent ex and a club scene he is n't ready for .
Finally , Rea 's IRA honchos reassert themselves , leading into an action - filled third act that comes with car chases , murder threats , bomb plots , and eventually outright murder .
Davidson 's true nature is far from the only thing about the film that keeps viewers off - balance and trying to guess what 's going to happen next .
MARRIOTTSVILLE , Md. 
In the basement of Phyllis Fick ’s ordinary - looking suburban house , Tim Kenny of C&O Conservation , a nonprofit weatherization company , found black streaks of dirt on the yellow fiberglass insulation , evidence of air infiltration from the window beneath , a sure sign of an energy leak .
Nearby on the basement ceiling , a drainpipe from the bathroom above had spider webs around it , another bad sign .
Spiders build near air currents to draw insects to their webs , Mr. Kenny , C&O ’s manager , said , and the current probably ran from the basement to the attic , taking heated air with it .
But the “ aha ! ” moment for the C&O team belonged to Brian Kinzer , who put a ladder on the front porch and pulled down the vinyl covering of the underside of the roof overhang .
Instead of plywood , he was staring at the bright metal of a heating duct that curved up to the second - floor bedroom of Mrs.
Fick ’s 18 - year - old daughter .
The duct had been unprotected from the outdoor temperature since the house was built about 30 years ago .
“ Look at this ! ” Mr. Kinzer said in triumph .
Call it CSI : Thermal Police  energy experts armed with mostly low - tech tools but strong sleuthing skills , finding flaws that let the air inside a house go through a full exchange with the outdoors twice an hour , instead of once every two or three hours .
Today 's the day the Big Three return to Congress to make another pitch for a $ 25 billion bailout .
They 'll be armed with detailed plans outlining how they 'd use the money to turn themselves around , but you 've gotta wonder if anything they suggest is too little , too late .
There is no doubt the auto industry is facing a seismic change and the Detroit automakers must become drastically different companies if they are to survive .
There 's some evidence Detroit finally realizes that .
General Motors is talking about shutting down factories and killing brands .
Ford is looking at ditching Volvo and cutting executive pay .
And Chrysler , well , no one 's really sure what Chrysler is thinking , but The New York Times says the company may tell lawmakers only a merger will ensure its survival .
None of this may be enough to convince Congress to pony up , and it almost certainly is n't enough to save Detroit .
The industry needs a top - to - bottom overhaul , and bankruptcy may be the only thing to bring it .
CEOs for the Big Three say it would spell their doom , but a growing chorus of lawmakers and financial experts say Chapter 11 should be a part of any government handout .
And that means the Big Three become the Medium Two .
It would be difficult to overstate the depth of the crisis Detroit faces .
GM is burning through $ 52,000 every minute , according to the Associated Press , and without an infusion could be broke by month 's end .
Ford and Chrysler may not last beyond next fall without help .
Barron 's says GM needs upward of $ 100 billion to make it through next year .
No one 's asking for that much , but Congress has been reluctant to offer anything at all .
Given Detroit 's track record — yeah , guys , hybrids will never catch on — who can blame it ?
GM is the one most likely to face bankruptcy , but as Barron 's notes , as goes GM , so goes Detroit .
" There is a near certainty that if GM goes bankrupt , Ford and Chrysler would have to follow suit , " John Casesa , managing partner of Casea Strategic Advisors , told the magazine .
" Neither could hope to function normally if GM suddenly managed to cut its cost base dramatically . "
There 's Bankruptcy , and then there 's bankruptcy .
What we 're talking about here is Chapter 11 , which protects companies from creditors while they sorts out debts , renegotiate contracts and restructure their business .
Chapter 11 helped turn many airlines into leaner , more efficient businesses .
A negotiated or " prepackaged " bankruptcy — in which the terms are worked out before the filing — would provide greater latitude to revise labor contracts , trim dealer networks , eliminate brands and take other drastic steps .
Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post says it could be wrapped up in a matter of weeks or months , minimizing the risk consumers would be frightened away from American cars .
Some sort of government assistance would be needed even under a prepackaged bankruptcy , and the Associated Press says a growing number of lawmakers are inclined to play along .
So what would happen under a prepack ?
Any top managers left standing would see big pay cuts .
The United Auto Workers would see its gold - plated benefits package radically revised .
GM would close as many as half its plants and unload as many as four brands ( likely candidates include Saab , Pontiac , Hummer and Saturn ) .
In addition to unloading Volvo , Ford would kiss Mercury goodbye .
Chrysler would dump everything but Jeep and its minivans , and the whole shebang would probably become part of GM or Ford .
GM 's already tried a shotgun wedding , so perhaps Ford would have better luck .
It could benefit more from Chrysler 's budding EV program and may be in a better position to broker a deal given its ( relatively ) stronger financial position .
This whole mess may well land up in President - elect Obama 's lap when he takes office in January , and he 's suggested bankruptcy may not be the answer .
If it is n't , something very much like it ought to be , says Robert Reich , the Clinton Administration labor secretary now serving on Obama 's board of economic advisers .
" In exchange for government aid , the Big Three 's creditors , shareholders and executives should be required to accept losses as large as they 'd endure under Chapter 11 , and the UAW should agree to some across - the - board wage and benefit cuts , " he wrote in his blog .
Such a move , coupled with a bailout , would allow Detroit to shift production to more fuel - efficient cars while keeping most of its workforce intact , he says .
It 's time for Detroit to realize Chapter 11 is its best chance for survival , and for lawmakers to make it a part of any bailout .

This article mentions the Wikimedia Foundation , one of its projects , or people related to it .
Wikinews is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation .
Wikinews has learned that a German Internet watchdog group is planning on removing the album cover of a German rock band album called Virgin Killer from search engines , just four days after the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , in the United Kingdom , blocked access to it on the free encyclopedia , Wikipedia .
Wikipedia , along with Wikinews , are owned by the Wikimedia Foundation .
The German association for voluntary self - regulation in online media ( FSM ) asked the Federal Inspectorate for young people media ( BPjM ) on December 9 , to remove URLs to the album cover from Germany 's search engines .
The action appears to be in direct response to the Wikipedia article and image blockage by the IWF on December 7 .
According to their website , the BPjM 's goal is to " protect children and adolescents in Germany from any media which might contain harmful or dangerous content " , pursuant to Germany 's Youth Protection Act .
The protection act regulates the distribution of harmful materials to minors .
According to German press reports , the FSM received complaints and concerns that the image could be considered child pornography and pose a danger to minors .
The Virgin Killer album cover is from the 1976 German rock band Scorpions .
It depicts a girl who appears to be around 10 to 12 - years old , posing nude , with a lens crack crossing over her genitals , but nothing blocking out her breasts .
It first appeared on the band 's album over thirty years ago , and Klaus Meine , the lead singer for Scorpions , recently said that they regret having made the cover .
It was later replaced with a photo of the band .
Despite the complaint , the FSM does not believe the album cover is actually child pornography , but says the dissemination of images of underage children as appears on the album cover , is " forbidden " in Germany .
" The picture shows the girl in an unnatural ' pose ' , and a such depiction is prohibited according to the German Youth Media Protection Law , " said Maja Winter to Wikinews in an exclusive statement .
The URLs to the album cover will be blocked from being displayed or searched in search results in the German search engine service , which according to Winter " are members of the FSM " .
Winter also added that internet users in Germany will not be blocked from accessing the image .
1976 album cover for Scorpions which previously appeared on Amazon.com , and many other sites .
" The URL will thus still be online , but will not be searchable by the respective search engine services .
The FSM is not planning nor developing nor implementing an internet filter on the access - level to block [ the cover ] , " added Winter who also said that she had no information on previous complaints in the past 30 years .
Winter also could not answer why the FSM decided to take such an action after so many years of the album cover being available and should contact the BPjM for more information .
Despite the claim from the FSM , the BPjM said in a statement to Wikinews that they denied having any knowledge of any such attempt at removing URLs to the cover .
" The BPjM has no knowledge of any measures being taken to block the depiction of the album cover from German search engines , " said Petra Meier , a spokesperson for the BPjM to Wikinews .
The spokesperson also added that there have been no complaints filed with the BPjM regarding the cover .
As first reported by Wikinews on December 7 , British Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) implemented a monitoring and filtering mechanism that blocked access to the album cover and the album 's article on Wikipedia .
The measures applied redirect traffic for a significant portion of the UK's Internet population through six servers which can log and filter the content that is available to the end user .
A serious side - effect of this is the inability of administrators on Wikimedia sites to block vandals and other troublemakers without potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of innocent contributors who are working on the sites in good faith .
The IWF said that the image could " contain illegal " material , but on December 9 , reversed their decision and unblocked the image and article .
" The Protection of Children Act 1978 as amended in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 , makes it an offence to take , make , permit to be taken , distribute , show , possess with intent to distribute , and advertise indecent photographs or pseudo - photographs of children under the age of 18 .
The ‘ making ’ of such images includes downloading , that is , making a copy of a child sexual abuse image on a computer , so , in the UK , accessing such content online is a serious criminal offence , " said the IWF in a statement on their website on December 7 .
Despite this , Mike Godwin , the legal counsel for Wikimedia said on December 9 that the image does not appear to be illegal anywhere in the world .
" We recognize the good intentions of Internet watch groups , including their focus on blocking and discouraging illegal content .
Nevertheless , this incident underscores the need for transparency and accountability in the processes of the Internet Watch Foundation and similar bodies around the world , " said the legal counsel for Wikimedia , Mike Godwin .
On December 8 , Godwin stated that there is " no reason to believe the article , or the image contained in the article , has been held to be illegal in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world . "

The second Beta development milestone of Firefox 3.1 , codenamed Shiretoko , is now available for download .
While it had already started working on Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 , Mozilla managed at the end of the past week to deliver the Beta 2 bits of the next iteration of its open source browser .
Labeled a public preview release , Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 is designed to enhance web compatibility and speed , as well as take performance to the next level .
A taste of Beta 3 is already up for grabs , with Mozilla having debuted work on the next development milestone while it was still wrapping up the Beta 2 build .
Following Beta 3 , Firefox 3.1 will move into release Candidate ( RC ) stage .
If until the Beta 2 release Mozilla failed to bring the new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine into the limelight , this is no longer the case .
TraceMonkey is now turned on by default in Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 , and users no longer have to dig into the browser 's configuration in order to enjoy superior JavaScript performance .
In addition , the improvements in TraceMonkey have been accompanied by the evolution of the Gecko layout engine , also with the focus on performance .
On the track of Internet Explorer 8 , Mozilla now introduces Private Browsing Mode , kicking the privacy capabilities of the open source browser to the next level .
Via the Clear Recent History options , users can be extremely selective about what Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 will remember of their browsing session .
Available in 54 localized versions , Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 comes to the table with boosted support for < video > and < audio > elements , the W3C Geolocation API , JavaScript query selectors , CSS 2.1 and 3 properties , SVG transforms and offline applications .
In this context , Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 now comes very close to acing the Acid3 Test , which Opera 10.0 Alpha 1 has no problems passing with flying colors , while the same cannot be said about Internet Explorer 8 .
Still , changes also reverberate on the surface of the open source browser , namely in terms of user experience .
The alterations related to the tab switching and preview behavior , which were made available in previous releases of Firefox 3.1 , will be most notable .
New Tabbed Browsing capabilities now allow users more flexibility when it comes down to handling tabs , including dragging and dropping items outside of one instance of Firefox in order to make a transition of the content to a standalone window .
Additionally , Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 now provides more information about the updating process , including an estimate of the time remaining .
The restore capabilities of Firefox 3.1 have also evolved , with a new session restore dialog box permitting users to select exactly the tabs and windows they want to be restored in the eventuality of a crash .
Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 for Windows is available here .
Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 for Linux is available here .
Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 for Mac OS X is available here .
President Obama knows that early action on human trafficking could have global impact .
He should start by reconsidering the use of raids -- they 're not working .
In 2007 , the junior U.S. senator
from Illinois , Barack Obama , sponsored a Senate resolution creating
the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness , which we observed on
Sunday , January 11 .
Human trafficking is rarely on the pundits ’ list
of priorities for President Obama ’s administration , but
he knows that early action in this area could have global impact .
For
starters , he should reconsider the current approach of raids , raids
and more raids .
It ’s not working .
The Sex Workers Project at New York’s
Urban Justice Center
recently interviewed law enforcement personnel , service providers who
have helped hundreds of trafficking victims , and a small sample of immigrant
women trafficked into sex work and other forms of labor , including domestic
work .
We found that while there have been some successes , raids are generally an ineffective
anti-trafficking tool ,
and in many cases are harmful to people who have been trafficked .
Trafficked women reported that
they were repeatedly arrested , in some cases up to ten times , in police
raids on brothels and other sex work venues , without ever being identified
as trafficked .
Yet that is the ostensible purpose of these raids – to
" rescue " the 14,000 to 17,000 women , men and children the US government
estimates are trafficked into the United States annually .
These women’s
reports were consistent with those from service providers across the
country : a supervisor at a national organization working with trafficking
victims said very few trafficked people are referred for services after
raids .
Recent federal data supports
this conclusion .
In the eight years since current anti-trafficking laws
went into effect , only 787 people have received the " T " immigration
visa set up to give residency and job status to trafficking victims ,
even though 5,000 such visas are available every year .

Clearly existing law is ineffective .
Raids , for their part , are violent , chaotic events involving kicking
down doors , drawn guns and much yelling and shoving , further traumatizing
trafficking victims and decreasing the likelihood that they will cooperate
with law enforcement in prosecuting their traffickers .
Some raids were
in fact accompanied by violations of the rights of the very people the
raids were intended to protect .
One woman interviewed for our
report told of being pistol - whipped and publicly strip - searched by officers
during a raid .
Many more spoke of being interrogated following raids
without being given access to an attorney .
The Obama administration has
the opportunity to reassess this failed federal approach to human trafficking .
The recent passage of federal anti-trafficking legislation championed
by Vice President Joe Biden offers a fresh start – and a chance
to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past .
A good first step would be
to move away from high - profile , resource - intensive and largely ineffective
raids and to address the economic and social circumstances that increase
vulnerability to trafficking .
It flourishes in labor sectors with few
protections , such as domestic work , agriculture , the service industry ,
and informal economies such as day labor and , yes , sex work .
Expansion
and targeted enforcement of labor laws in these sectors would not only
go a long way toward locating , identifying and assisting trafficked
persons , it would also protect the rights of all workers .
For the long term , strategies
led by individuals and communities with knowledge of and access to trafficked
people are far more likely than raids to meet with success .
Obama’s
2007 Senate resolution recognized this , noting that the people most
likely to come into contact with trafficking victims are " essential
for effective enforcement " – but at the moment , such people are not
shielded from immigration consequences or arrest if they come forward .
Half the trafficked women we
interviewed for our report did not leave abusive situations as a result
of law enforcement intervention , but rather thanks
to the help of co-workers , clients and members of their communities .
Others said they would have left on their own if they had known of a
safe place to go or if someone had offered to help them .
People who
had been trafficked themselves were the most effective in locating ,
recognizing and assisting trafficking victims .
Trafficking victims by definition
have sought opportunity in the United States only to find themselves
in coercive and abusive situations .
We owe it to them to find better
ways to locate , identify and assist them , and to develop anti-trafficking
initiatives that prioritize their needs , choices , and self - determination
as human beings .
A good way to start would be to extend a helping hand
that is not also holding a gun .
One of the biggest problems in looking at biological tissues through a microscope is the lack of contrast .
Basically , everything , with the exception of red blood cells , is transparent to visible light .
The faint structures that are visible can be seen due to the tiny amount of light scattered from things like cell walls , the nucleus , and organelles .
To get around this problem , researchers usually label the structures they are interested in with a dye .
When the sample is illuminated by a laser , the dye fluoresces like crazy , providing nice , bright , false - color images of the structure .
Of course , you need to know what you want to label and how to label it , and you need to know that the label is n't changing what you are looking at .
If you are interested in looking at the dynamics of living cells , you have to hope that the dye does n't kill the cell as it breaks down .
In short , using dyes is both a wonder and a curse .
Immunofluorescence is great if you
like your cells dead .
Some recent research , published in the Journal of the Optical Society of America B , shows that the visibility of some very specific features in label - free images can be significantly enhanced with a little bit of optical trickery .
The imaging technique is called coherent anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy ( CARS ) , and it 's being touted as a label - free imaging technique that can provide resolution competitive with standard confocal microscopes at video frame rates .
CARS makes use of the vibrational modes of molecules to selectively image them .
Two atoms in a molecule are held together through a chemical bond that is much like a spring .
The mass of the atoms , and the strength of the spring provide a set of vibrational motions and rates that , when viewed globally , are unique to the molecule .
Some of these characteristic vibrations can be indirectly detected through Raman scattering , where a relatively high - energy photon hits the molecule and excites a vibrational mode .
In doing so , it loses energy and is shifted to a redder part of the spectrum , which is called a Stokes shift .
By measuring the change in wavelength , one can detect the presence of different vibrational modes .
CARS modifies this by using both high - energy photons ( called the pump beam ) , and a second beam of photons at the expected redder wavelength ( called the Stokes beam ) .
The pump beam provides the driving energy to set the molecules vibrating , while the Stokes beam stimulates the molecules to emit in that particular vibration mode .
Since the pump beam is still present , the molecules get whacked a second time and , since they are already vibrating , the photons that come out are bluer than the pump light ( called an anti-Stokes emission ) .
This anti-Stokes light is easier to detect for a number of reasons , the principle one being that this is a coherent process , so all the light travels in a single direction — if we just used the Stokes side , the light would be emitted in every direction .
On the other hand , the CARS signal has two components : the resonant signal , which is what you really want to see , and some unwanted , nonresonant background .
Getting rid of the background signal while not eliminating the resonant signal is one of the major challenges of CARS research today .
The work of Lu and coworkers , from the National University of Singapore , uses a clever trick to simultaneously filter the nonresonant background and amplify the resonant signal .
The key is that the nonresonant background light has a slightly different polarization than the resonant signal .
If one puts in a polarization filter at the right angle , the nonresonant background is eliminated , but so is most of the resonant signal that we want .
The researchers took the Stokes beam and divided it into two beams .
One of the beams has its polarization rotated so that the two beams are 90 degrees from each other .
At this point , the two Stokes beams can't interact with each other at all .
The resonant part of the two anti-Stokes beams can interact though and , due to the coherence of the process , this interaction depends on the relationship between the two Stokes beams .
By shifting a mirror between two positions , the researchers obtained two images .
One was basically the nonresonant background , and the second contained the resonant signal , the nonresonant background , and the two multiplied together — think of the nonresonant background as amplifying the resonant signal .
Subtracting the two images provided an amplified version of the resonant signal .
They showed that , compared to filtering , they obtain a 20 - fold increase in the signal - to - background ratio .
Furthermore , the signal intensity , compared to the total CARS signal , is only a factor of two smaller , indicating that this is a pretty effective way of getting rid of the nonresonant background .
There are a few pretty pictures of cells and polystyrene beads to back up their data — I have to say , I was impressed .
CARS microscopy is quite complicated in terms of equipment , setup , and alignment .
This adds a little complexity to the system , but that addition is nothing compared to the complexity of the original set up .
Although I like the CARS technique , and I know of places that are trying to set them up outside the research lab , I do n't think we are going to be looking at widespread adoption anytime soon .

With her 5 - week - old baby asleep face - down across her lap , Erica Richardson settled into a chair at the Union Rescue Mission and reviewed her strategies for staying sane while living with an infant in a homeless shelter .
The key is to get away from the shelter during the day , the tired - looking 33 - year - old said .
Head to the park , to a friend ’s house , to any place where she can pretend , for a while anyway , that she is just another mom on an outing .
And , she added , placing a hand protectively on the sleeping form of her son Lonnie , “ I just pray every day . ”
A homeless mother sitting next to her -- who was also juggling an infant on her lap as well as tending to a 2 - year - old in a stroller -- nodded vigorously .
“ I was getting ready to say the same thing , ” said Cheirre Copeland .
Then she leaned forward to offer some survival tricks of her own .

The economic crisis and cold weather have created a larger than usual influx of families to shelters in Los Angeles County this year , according to shelter officials and other service providers .
On Wednesday , officials at the Union Rescue Mission , which runs the county ’s cold - weather shelters , held an emergency meeting to figure out what to do when they run out of hotel vouchers for families , which could happen this month .
The numbers , said Chief Executive Andy Bales , are sobering :
The region ’s winter shelters and the skid row mission have seen 86 families in the last three weeks .
By comparison , last year the agency took in 20 families at its emergency shelters over the entire cold weather season from Dec. 1 to March 15 , with 15 to 20 more at its downtown mission .
Two weeks ago , the mission downtown opened up its fifth floor to two - parent families and single fathers with children , something it has never had to do before .
It may also convert its chapel to sleeping quarters .
“ This is , as far as I am concerned , a disaster of Katrina - esque proportions , ” said Tanya Tull , chief executive of the nonprofit Beyond Shelter .
A variety of negative economic forces are contributing , she said , from job losses to an uptick in foreclosures .

The signs , Tull said , are everywhere : from the father who pretends to work through the night at a computer at a 24 - hour office supply center so his child can sleep safe and warm in a stroller to the mother who takes a baby to the emergency room at 11 p.m. , knowing the odds are they wo n’t be called until morning and can pass the night in the waiting room .
Even in good times , Los Angeles County -- the most populous in the nation -- has more homeless people than any other metropolitan region in the country .
According to a count taken almost two years ago , before the recession began , there were 73,000 people without homes on any given night .
Officials at the county Homeless Services Authority estimate that nearly a quarter of the homeless are parents and their children .
The first choice for many families is a motel room .
Government and social services agencies routinely provide families with room vouchers -- but those are growing scarce this year , according to Bales and others .

Carmelita Robertson , for example , lived in a motel room for weeks with her 2 - year - old daughter , Jaira .
But after she ran out of vouchers , she wound up sharing a room with three other single mothers on the fourth floor of the Union Rescue Mission .
She said she was grateful for being able to move up from an open cot to a private , tented one this week , where she and her daughter have a little privacy at night .
On a recent night , as Jaira scrambled across her cot holding a snow globe that played Christmas carols , Robertson described her descent into homelessness .
She said she was working as a housekeeper at a Long Beach hotel and making the rent on a studio apartment -- but because of the economy , her hours kept getting cut .
Last spring , she moved to Virginia to save money by staying with her mother , but they clashed and she came back to Los Angeles in July .
She could n’t find work , and wound up on the street .

She ’s been at the mission since late November .
She takes buses across town each day , putting her daughter in day care in South Los Angeles , then heading north for classes to become a medical technician , then reversing her route back to the mission .
Having her daughter with her , she said , keeps her focused on improving her situation .
“ Even though we are homeless , we have to stabilize .
Keep clothes .
Keep diapers .
When you have kids , you have to .
. . .
That ’s what keeps most women down here pushing , the fact that we have children . ”
The mothers also help one another .
Many have cellphones , and they exchange numbers and call one another when they find out about free toys , diapers or other opportunities .

Copeland , a shelter occupant who is 22 and pregnant with her third child , offered more thoughts on how to survive the street .
Make sure you have some kind of activity every day , she said .
If you have to go to the pediatrician , a social services center or the housing office , do n’t do it all in one day -- instead , stretch it out over three , leaving fewer empty days .
And no matter what , make sure your cellphone is charged so people can reach you with good tips on food or clothes or just a diverting piece of gossip .
Richardson nodded .
She has been homeless since July , when she was five months ’ pregnant .
She had been living with her son ’s father in an apartment in South Los Angeles , but he went to jail , leaving her without a way to pay the rent .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has conditionally offered Eric Holder the job as attorney general , and the former top Clinton administration official has accepted , a senior Democrat said on Tuesday .
Before the offer becomes official , Obama ’s team wants to determine if Holder could win Senate confirmation with broad bipartisan support and clean up a Justice Department wracked by scandals during George W. Bush ’s presidency , the Democrat said .
“ We know we have the votes for Senate confirmation , but we want to make sure he would have broad support so he can make needed reforms , ” said the Democrat , who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue .
Since Obama ’s election two weeks ago , the 57 - year - old Holder , the deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton , has emerged as the top candidate for the job as the nation ’s top law enforcement and legal officer who deals with issues like terrorism and crime .
Obama is the first black elected president , and Holder would be the first black to head the Justice Department .
As attorney general , Holder would play a key role in setting policy on prosecuting terrorism cases while protecting civil liberties .
Like Obama , Holder has said the United States must reverse “ the disastrous course ” set by the Bush administration in the struggle against terrorism by closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba that now holds about 250 prisoners .
Holder also has said the United States must stop sending individuals to nations that engage in torture , must cease warrantless domestic surveillance and must declare without qualification the United States does not torture people .
The Bush administration , which denies torturing suspects , has been criticized by human rights groups for using waterboarding , a widely condemned technique that simulates drowning , and other tough interrogation methods on al Qaeda suspects captured after the September 11 attacks .
CONTROVERSIAL PARDON
The source said Democrats in the Senate were trying to gauge how much opposition there would be to Holder from Republicans over his role in Clinton ’s controversial 2001 pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich .
Holder at the time said he was “ neutral , leaning toward favorable ” on the pardon .
Justice Department prosecutors were upset he did not oppose the pardon , issued on Clinton ’s last day in office .
Rich ’s ex-wife was a major donor to Clinton and the Democratic Party .
The senior Democrat said at this point the Rich pardon does not appear to be “ a fatal flaw concern . ”
The Justice Department ’s inspector general last week listed “ restoring confidence ” at number five among the department ’s top 10 challenges for 2008 .
“ The immediate challenge for the attorney general and the department ’s leadership is to ensure that the serious problems and misconduct we found regarding politicized hiring for career positions and the dismissal of U.S. attorneys do not recur , ” his report said .
The scandals which hurt the Justice Department ’s reputation included findings that department officials used political factors in the hiring and firing of federal prosecutors and other Justice Department employees .
Two Justice Department officials said Holder , a former prosecutor who handled corruption cases , a local judge and then the U.S. attorney in Washington , D.C. , was generally respected , admired and well regarded by career employees .
“ We ’re very happy with the choice , ” said one official who knew Holder when he had previously been at the department .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat who would hold a confirmation hearing on the attorney general nominee , has been complimentary of Holder in the past .
But he had no comment on the possible nomination on Tuesday .
Holder helped vet candidates to become Obama ’s vice presidential running mate and has been a senior legal adviser for Obama ’s presidential campaign .
A partner at the law firm Covington & Burling in the District of Columbia , Holder was not immediately available for comment .
En route to a training camp in Quebec during World War I , Canadian army lieutenant Harry Colebourn bought a bear cub for $ 20 from a hunter in White River , Ontario .
He named her Winnipeg , after his hometown , and smuggled her to England , where “ Winnie ” became the mascot of his militia regiment .
Eventually he donated her to the London Zoo , where she became a great favorite of Christopher Robin Milne , the son of a local playwright .
You know the rest .
( CNN ) -- Ford Motor Company chief executive Alan Mulally defended his company Tuesday against charges that Ford caused its own problems and said bailing out Detroit was essential to the U.S. economic recovery .
Ford CEO
Alan Mulally says Tuesday the auto industry " is just absolutely essential " to the economy .
Hours before Mulally and other heads of the Big Three automakers were scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Housing , Banking and Urban Affairs , Mulally appeared on CNN's " American Morning " to discuss his expected testimony .
Mulally told CNN's John Roberts that Ford took time to develop an electric hybrid car because its top priority was making the internal combustion engine more efficient .
He also defended the company 's advertising blitz for the F - 150 pickup truck and said the company had been working on improving its fuel efficiency long before there was talk of bailing out Ford , General Motors and Chrysler .
John Roberts :
Why should taxpayers give you any of their hard - earned money ?
Alan Mulally : Well , I think the compelling argument is that the automobile industry is just absolutely essential to the United States ' economy .
We are in an economic situation now , with the credit crisis and the financial and the banking issues , that we really , more than ever , the automobile industry needs to be part of the solution .
And the only thing that we 're asking for is to set up a bridge loan mechanism so that if the economy continues to deteriorate in the near term , that we could access that so we could continue to invest in the products that people really do want and value and help be part of this economic recovery .
Watch Mulally defend Ford 's call for a bailout »
Roberts :
But you know what the critics are saying .
Critics are saying that you fought efforts as an industry to increase fuel economy standards , you promoted SUVs and pickups as demand for foreign oil increased , and we 're beginning to run out of oil .
They 're saying basically you failed to lead , and now you have your hand out saying , " Help us . "
Mulally :
And for that we also recognized the cost it would take to do that , so the Congress built into that legislation a mechanism that we could borrow at the Treasury rate so we could fund the acceleration of these vehicles and bring them to the marketplace .
That is going very well .
We are applying for that today .
I think the most important thing is that we continue as a country to work this as a partnership and clearly fuel efficiency , quality , safety are going to continue to be at the top of the customer 's decision list when they purchase a car .
Watch what it could cost to let the Big Three crumble »
Roberts :
At the same time , Mr. Mulally , the people who will be asking you questions this afternoon are looking for some guarantees .
Chris Dodd is the chairman of the committee that you 'll be sitting before .
Here 's what he said in terms of wanting some guarantees from the industry : " Clearly , we should n't be writing checks without some clear conditionality of what 's going to happen with that industry , if they 're going to change and get back on their feet again . "
Can you guarantee to the American people that if you get that money , if the American taxpayers throw you a lifeline , you will change , you 'll become more efficient , you 'll produce cars that people want to buy , you 'll increase fuel efficiency , you will , indeed , move into the future ?
Watch why Congress wants to hear from Mulally »
Mulally : Absolutely .
I do n't think it 's a promise .
I think it 's a promise that we are already delivering on today .
When you look at the Ford lineup going forward , we have now cars , small , medium , and large cars , utilities , and trucks that are absolutely world class in their quality , in their fuel mileage , in their safety -- on par and competing and in many cases much better than Toyota and Honda .
We have a business plan .
Roberts :
One of the cars you 'll be introducing in 2009 is the Ford Fusion hybrid , and you are very excited about that , but it 's being introduced 12 years after Toyota introduced the Prius .
Why did it take so long ?
Mulally :
Well , that 's really one model of the vehicles .
The very first hybrid was introduced by Ford with the Escape .
Roberts :
It was an SUV .
Mulally : Absolutely , but we have been there on the fuel efficiency from day one , and it's been part of Bill Ford 's original vision of sustainability and energy efficiency and being better environmentally concerned .
Roberts :
Here 's a question I have this morning .
I think a lot of people are asking this same question as well .
You are betting that because the price of gasoline is now down to an average of about $ 2.06 a gallon nationwide that that will rekindle interest in your Ford F - 150 pickup truck line , and I know that you are trying to improve the fuel efficiency -- I think the latest model is 15 [ mpg ] city , 21 miles to the gallon on the highway .
Some people are thinking , " Oh my God , the price of gas is going down , and now you just want to repeat the mistakes of the past all over again . "
iReport.com : Your thoughts on the Big Three bailout
Mulally :
That 's absolutely incorrect because our plan is to have a full portfolio of small , medium , and larger vehicles that our consumers really want , and clearly the 150 that you have described has been the industry leader in the United States for 34 years , and the consumers love and need that vehicle .
They absolutely love the 150 .
We are complementing that now , just like you mentioned , with small - and medium - size cars and utilities , all of which will be best in class on fuel efficiency .
So we want to be there with a full portfolio that the consumers really do want .
Roberts : General Motors has got an electric car coming out .
It 's not going to come out until 2010 , 2011 .
Does Ford have a fully plug - in hybrid vehicle coming ?
Watch how despite woes at home GM hopes to expand abroad »
Mulally :
We are working on that also , but let me just share with you the Ford plan about that .
Our No. 1 priority is to improve the internal combustion engine , and that 's why the turbocharging , the direct fuel injection , we get a 20 percent improvement in fuel mileage and a 15 percent reduction in CO2 , but we get that across all of the engines , across all the vehicles .
Then we move to more electrification with the hybrids as you mentioned , and we are very excited that the next step after that will be full electrification .
Now we 're tied into the grids , and we really have moved to an energy independence solution .

“ This is a gift that every asshole neighbor should get . ” Your Neighbor - Trenton , NJ
“ Not only was your poop some of the finest poop ever sent in the mail , but your placement of the " wanna find out who sent this " card within the poop forces the pooped on to actually sift through the poop only to find out that you 'll never tell them who sent them the poop .
I just finally heard back from the pooped on friend and I almost pooped myself when I heard he dug through the poop to find out who sent him the poop . ”

I decided to give him a dose of his own medicine and sent him the big bag of elephant crap .
About 5 days after I ordered it my wife saw the bright yellow truck stop at their house with a delivery in the early afternoon .
When I was home cutting the grass later that day I saw him come home from work , about 5 minutes later I saw him come back out of the house with a disgusted look on his face and a big bag of crap in his hand headed for the garbage cans .
Mission accomplished .
The best part is it sat in their house all afternoon while his wife was probably wondering what it could be .
Great !

( CNN ) -- Oprah Winfrey once dubbed it the " greatest love story " she had ever heard : a boy held at a Nazi concentration camp during World War II and a girl on the outside who tossed him apples to keep him alive .
They eventually married and grew old together .
Herman Rosenblat has acknowledged his Holocaust love story is fake : " I am sorry . " more photos »
It turns out the story of Herman and Roma Rosenblat is n't true .
The two had told their love story for years and years , inspiring a book deal , an upcoming movie , and stories across the globe on television , in papers and on the Internet .
A children 's book , " Angel Girl , " was also based on their love story .
When the couple appeared on " The Oprah Winfrey Show " more than a decade ago , the famed host called it " the single greatest love story in 22 years of doing this show . "
Watch how Holocaust love story proves bogus »
But over the weekend , Herman Rosenblat issued a statement through his literary agent , Andrea Hurst , acknowledging the story of how he met his wife was made up .
" Why did I do that and write the story with the girl and the apple , because I wanted to bring happiness to people , to remind them not to hate , but to love and tolerate all people .
I brought good feelings to a lot of people , and I brought hope to many .
My motivation was to make good in this world , " he said in the statement .
" In my dreams , Roma will always throw me an apple , but I now know it is only a dream . "
Herman Rosenblat really was in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II -- a subcamp of Buchenwald -- and he really has been married to Roma for decades .
Beyond that , the truth is murky .
See the true horrors inside Buchenwald concentration camp »
Berkley Books immediately canceled publication of Rosenblat 's memoir , " Angel at the Fence , " which was set to be released in February .
" Berkley will demand that the author and the agent return all money that they have received for this work , " Berkley spokesman Craig Burke said in a statement .
A movie version of the Rosenblats ' story -- even though now proven a hoax -- remains in the works .
Atlantic Overseas Pictures says the movie is a fictionalized adaptation and that " the story retains its power to grip audiences worldwide . "
Many Holocaust scholars had long cast doubt on the Rosenblats ' story .
Professor Ken Waltzer , the director of Michigan State University 's Jewish Studies program , said he began raising questions to the agent and publisher in November , suggesting that the story was fabricated .
But he says his numerous queries went unanswered .
He says he told the editor that the story is " at best embellished and perhaps invented . "
" The idea of a prisoner being able autonomously to approach the fence not just once , but every day at the same time , ... none of it seemed plausible , " Waltzer says .
" That fence was right next to the SS barracks , so to go to the fence , which was also punishable by death , was to risk death . "
In a letter to " The New Republic , " which first began questioning the validity of the Rosenblats ' story , Waltzer said he was also disturbed about why few others had come forward to point out holes in the couple 's account .
" Less understandable is the widespread belief in their story -- by the culture makers , including the publisher and movie maker and many thousands of others who have encountered it over a decade , " he said .
" Second , such belief suggests a broad illiteracy about the Holocaust and about experience in the camps -- despite decades of books , serious memoirs , museums , and movies .
This shakes this historian up . "
" This memoir was at the far end of implausibility , yet until yesterday , no one connected with packaging , promoting , and disseminating it asked questions about or investigated it .
Some actively resisted such investigation and tried to shut mine down . "
New Republic special correspondent Gabriel Sherman told CNN another disturbing element is that Herman Rosenblat really is a Holocaust survivor who " did n't need to embellish his love story , because his own story is so powerful . "
Watch Sherman describe the unraveling of the love story »
Sherman said Rosenblat was shot during a robbery in the 1990s at his workplace .
When he was was in the hospital , Rosenblat said he had a vision from his mother to tell his love story .
" From that moment on , he started telling his story in public , " Sherman said .
In his statement released over the weekend , Herman Rosenblat said , " To all [ who ] supported and believed in me and this story , I am sorry for all I have caused to you and everyone else in the world . "
Holocaust scholars say they hope the revelation that the love story is fictitious does n't distract from the reality of the Holocaust , when Nazi Germany killed 6 million Jews .
" On the far extreme , something like this could give fuel to those who are in the business of denying that the Holocaust ever took place , " said David Marwell , director of The Museum of Jewish Heritage .
CNN 's John Zarrella and Randi Kaye contributed to this report .

Revision 0.01 - Last modified February 7 , 2001
Questions and Answers :
Section 1 : Basic understanding .
1.1 : Why does n't my manager just do some actual work ?
Management is a kind of work .
Just as programs need architecture and design , functional groups of people can need organizing principles .
Having a person picked to handle this work can reduce the amount of time spent trying to decide how to make decisions , and can free other people up to do the work they 're best at .
1.2 : Is it useful for me to have a manager ?
It depends on the kind of job you 're doing .
A manager can dramatically improve your performance , both as an individual and as a member of a team , or a manager can get in the way and keep you from working .
Work environments where managers are particularly useful are : Large environments , especially with high turnover .
Jobs where a significant amount of incoming information must be factored into planning .
Jobs which are prone to substantial obstructions coming between workers and their work .
Jobs where managers may interfere are : Creative work .
Fundamental engineering or research .
More generally , if the job allows for a person ( who might not be able to do the job ) to substantially help the people actually doing the work get it done , or depends on a substantial amount of decision making that does n't really require everyone 's constant input , it will probably benefit from management .
If the job consists entirely of things a single person can just sit down and do , a manager may just get underfoot .
The good news is , a manager who does a good job of " running interference " for his workers can improve productivity by amazing amounts ; you may see five to ten times the productivity you would have gotten if everyone had to stop working all the time to interact with the rest of the company ( or the outside world ) .
This wo n't happen all the time , but it will happen .
1.3 : How should I deal with my manager 's management ?
The same way you deal with any other source of requirements .
Whenever possible , assume that she is basically aware of what needs to happen - possibly more aware than you are .
Do n't fight her without good cause , and she 'll be fine .
1.4 : I do n't understand this at all .
This is confusing .
Is there a book on this ?
Probably not .
There 's lots of books for your manager on how to deal with employees , though , and if you read them , you may get a good idea of where he 's coming from .
Section 2 : Social issues
2.1 : My manager does n't fit in well with our corporate society .
He seems to do a good job , but he 's not getting along with the engineers .
This is common .
Your manager may not have found any people who get along well with " suits " .
A lot of engineers do n't have the personality traits ( or social skills ) to adapt to people different from themselves ; you should consider making an effort to get to know your manager , and accept his differences .
2.2 : My manager seems to dress funny .
Is there any way to impress upon him the pointlessness of corporate appearance ?
Your manager is probably aware that , in the abstract , the way she dresses changes nothing .
However , part of her job is to interact with other people , and there are rules of etiquette for these dealings .
Your manager 's clothing , even when she 's not dealing with other people , is selected in part as a way of telling you that she takes you seriously ; it 's just like calling people " sir " .
It 's a convention , but that does n't mean it 's not a real convention , and your manager is honoring it .
2.3 : My manager insists on being called by a title , and treated in a formal manner .
Your manager 's position is an aspect of a corporate hierarchy ; his title , and the formal modes of interaction , are part of that structure .
He is trying to do his job , which involves being aware of the " chain of command " and other corporate structures .
He may talk as though you are " beneath " him , and in terms of who has the decision - making power , you probably are - but this may not mean that he thinks you are a less valuable person than he is .
Try to treat him with respect , and remember that , in general , you show people respect on their terms , not on the terms you might otherwise prefer .
2.4 : My manager complains when I identify faults in the work of my coworkers .
Take your manager aside , and offer details of what 's wrong with the existing work .
She may end up not doing anything , but do n't nag her about it ; she 's juggling a lot of other priorities , too , and there may be good reasons for which she 's not doing anything about your complaints .
Whenever possible , try to help people solve problems , rather than just complaining about them .
Remember that there are n't enough great engineers to go around ; you may have to learn to live with the work that people who are merely competent can do .
Section 3 : Productivity .
3.1 : My manager complains when I spend time decompressing with games .
Managers are used to measuring work in terms of " hours of work done " ; in many cases , the work they 're evaluating does n't have a " percolation " phase , or is n't essentially unpredictable .
Try to find ways to decompress that look a little more useful , if you can , or see if you can explain the " background thought " process to your manager .
3.2 : My manager is getting impatient during a design phase .
Managers are trying to deal with a lot of requirements you may never see .
The manager is trying to run a business ; he wants to know what the product is , and when it will exist .
He wants to estimate costs .
It 's never possible to do a perfect job , but your manager is going to do the best job he can - which means he 's going to try to figure out how long your design phase is .
How do you figure out how long something takes ?
You measure the amount done so far , you look at how long it took , and you extrapolate .
Unfortunately , this does n't work very well for design .
Still , you can help your manager if you can find ways to express the state of the work .
Doodle things on whiteboards .
Write papers summarizing what issues you 're wrestling with , and what issues you think are nailed down .
The act of explaining may help you clarify these issues - and even if it does n't , it will show your manager that progress , of some sort , is happening .
3.3 : My manager does n't understand why I need to do this .
See if you can make time to try to explain it .
Try to find ways to work through your problems that meet your manager 's expectations for what people " working " look like .
3.4 : My manager complains whenever something I need to do was n't written in my job description .
Try to explain to her that the task needs to happen , and no one else is doing it .
You might suggest getting " general troubleshooting " added to your job description .
Try to get documentation on how useful the work you 're doing is - ask other employees to testify about the importance of what you 're doing for them , for instance .
3.5 : My work is done , but my manager wants me to look busy .
Explain that your work is done .
If your work is moderately periodic , such as phone support , suggest some low - priority tasks you could soak up ... or , as an alternative , explain that part of the job is that you 're effectively " on retainer " , to make sure they have someone when the job does need to be done .
3.6 : I 'm stuck , and my manager wo n't stop pressuring me to get unstuck .
The best solution I 've ever heard is to ask your manager what happens if he loses his keys .
How long will it take to find them ?
Once he 's done looking everywhere he can think of , why does n't he keep looking in all those places over and over and over ?
This is the best analogy to difficult creative work that most people will have had experience with .
3.7 : My job is boring and there 's nothing to do .
Ask your manager for more interesting work , or try to get a transfer to a different department , or look for new work .
3.8 : My manager wants me to stop " showing off " .
Try to avoid stepping on other peoples ' toes too much .
If someone you 're working with can't get his job done , and it 's faster for you to do it , go to your manager privately and discuss your concerns .
If she says to live with it , do ; there are many reasons why this could make sense .
3.9 : My manager insists that I come in to the office .
While much productive work can be done on your own time , in your own place , there 's a lot of benefit to social interaction with coworkers .
Your manager is trying to make sure that you all see each other occasionally , and build some social bonds .
He 's also probably aware that , when you do come in , you may get into a spontaneous conversation about some design issue , which can save weeks of work if you get the right people together .
Not all meetings are productive ; that does n't mean no meetings are .
Section 4 : Stimulus and response
4.1 : My manager is doing a good job .
Should I thank her ?
Yes !
Managers , just like everyone else , need to know when they 're doing their jobs well .
4.2 : My manager did something that bothered me , and I want to get back at him .
Do n't punish him .
Talk to him .
Explain why the behavior bothered you .
Ask him why he did it , or why this was necessary .
Try to understand his reasons ; they may be good ones , such as " if we do n't finish this project soon , we run out of money to pay you in about three months " .
If you find that the reasons are good , try to be understanding .
Let your manager know that you were convinced .
If you are n't convinced , try to live with the inconvenience anyway .
4.3 : My manager wants me to do management ; I am not interested , but she seems offended by this .
Your manager is from a corporate structure in which one advances in a hierarchy ; she may not be aware that you 're enjoying your work for its own merits , not doing it in the hopes of being " advanced " to a new position .
Try to explain that you 're doing the kind of work you are because you enjoy it .
4.4 : My manager can't raise my salary any more because I earn as much as he does .
This is silly , but it may be beyond your manager 's power to fix .
See if you can find alternatives - maybe he can offer you extended benefits .
If all else fails , try to get him to give you permission to do freelance consulting on your own time , and pick up some supplemental money .
4.5 : I can't believe the manager on my staff is worth as much as we 're paying .
As you go through the day , try to keep track of all the things you 're using and depending on that " just happen " .
Did you pay that phone bill ?
Who did ?
Your manager is probably doing a lot of things you are n't even aware are happening ; this is allowing you to focus on what 's important , doing your job .
Section 5 : What does that mean ?
5.1 : My manager does n't speak English .
At least , I do n't think so .
Managers have evolved their own set of words , just like technical jargon , to communicate more effectively .
Unfortunately , one of the things it 's designed to communicate is " I can speak long words without stuttering " .
Still , the chances are that most of what you 're hearing does have meaning , although it may be a little verbose .
[ It is also possible that English is not your manager 's native language , and that it 's not yours either .
Feel free to substitute a more appropriate language . ]
5.2 : My manager is demanding an estimate for something I have n't figured out yet .
Your manager is trying to decide trivial little things like " where does the paycheck come from " .
If paychecks are to come on regular schedules , the company 's income must come on , at least , a predictable schedule - which means your manager needs to have some idea of how long it will take you to do something .
Try to estimate .
Go ahead and warn your manager that the estimate is inaccurate ; you may want to use the example of " finding keys " to explain why .
5.3 : My manager has no sense of humor .
Your manager probably does n't have the same appreciation for meta - humor , recursion , and obscure technical puns that you do .
Try not to depend on jokes that require an engineering background ( or at least an engineer 's attitude ) as a means of communication or bonding with people who are n't , in the end , here to be engineers .
5.4 : My manager counts from one .
Ordinals ( counting numbers ) have always started from one ; counting from zero , while obvious and natural to many programmers , is probably wrong from a linguistic standpoint .
Try to be flexible .

It ’s time to throw away red , blue and purple , left and right , and get to the real and traditional crux of American politics : the battle for resources between the country ’s many diverse regions .
How President - elect Barack Obama balances these divergent geographic interests may have more to do with his long - term success than his ideological stance or media image .
Personal charm is transitory ; the struggle for money and jobs has a more permanent character .
To succeed as president , Obama must find a way to transcend his own very specific geography – university dominated , liberal de-industrialized Chicago - and address the needs of regions whose economies still depend on agriculture , energy and industry .
In the primaries , most of these went to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
The geographic concentration of manufacturing prepared by Praxis Strategy Group presents a particular complex roadmap for the new president .
Although Indiana and Wisconsin top our list of states most dependant on manufacturing employment , the next four are either in the Great Plains , Iowa , or in the south , Arkansas , Alabama and Mississippi .
In fact eight of the top 13 industrial states on a per capita basis are located in the South ; only one of these manufacturing hotbeds , North Carolina , supported the new president .
In terms of industry , the auto industry represents the most difficult challenge .
Great Lakes political leaders , like Michigan ’s clueless Gov. Jennifer Granholm , now a top Obama advisor , will twist the new president ’s arm to bail out the crippled U.S. - based auto manufacturers , essentially socializing the industry .
Yet in bailing out Detroit , Obama could undermine a thriving , growing auto complex developing in the old Confederacy and along the southern rim of Midwest .
Although also hit by the recession , companies like Toyota , Honda , Hyundai , Mercedes and BMW have brought unprecedented prosperity to these areas , which include some of historically poorest regions of the country .
This is also where many of the most fuel - efficient “ green ” vehicles in America are being produced .
The workers they employ may not belong to the unions so influential among liberals , but their interests matter mightily to Democrats as well as Republicans who represent them .
Energy issues may be even more challenging from a regional perspective .
The nation ’s fossil fuel resources are heavily concentrated in the west and South , led by Wyoming , Alaska , West Virginia , Oklahoma , Louisiana , New Mexico , Texas , Montana , North Dakota and Kentucky .
Sen .
Obama only took one of these states , New Mexico .
The new president ’s statements against coal and other fossil fuels were not popular in areas where these provide not only reliable low cost energy but also well - paying jobs .
Not just oil - riggers , heartland miners and coal companies have an interest in an expansive approach to energy policy .
If enacted , Obama ’s “ cap and trade ” proposals could raise the cost of Midwestern energy , largely coal - based , by between 20 to 40 percent , according to a recent study by Bernstein Research .
This would create yet another disadvantage for U.S. manufacturers , particularly against largely unregulated competitors in developing countries .
In contrast , reliable and affordable domestic energy supplies from all sources – including from nuclear facilities – would be a major boon manufacturers across the country .
Obama must recognize that many states with coal and oil reserves also possess strong wind and bioenergy potential .
He should favor expansion of both .
The resulting lower cost electrical power could boost an incipient electric car industry that may be the last , best hope for hard - pressed General Motors .
Here ’s another case where regional politics could prove sticky for Obama .
Any attempt to boost non-renewable energy supplies would run into opposition from the largely coastally - centered green lobby .
These groups generally oppose virtually any fossil fuel development , and most remain hostile to nuclear power .
While well - intentioned , increasingly restrictive environmental regulations on manufacturing could push production to parts of the world with dirtier industries and over reliance on shipping long distances .
The net reduction in carbon emissions , as a result would seem somewhat ephemeral .
The current recession and falling energy prices could provide political cover for Obama to shift his energy policies .
Hard times have already eroded support for strict curbs on greenhouse gases in Europe and strong advocacy for carbon taxes clearly hurt the Liberals in the recent Canadian elections .
A similar reaction could also emerge in this country , excepting the deepest blue coastal enclaves .
Finally there remains one other regional constituency that must be addressed , that of the financial community .
Our analysis shows securities and commodity trading industries to be regionally concentrated , with the largest clusters in greater New York , vice President - elect Biden ’s home state of Delaware , followed by New Hampshire and Illinois .
They are all now bedrock “ blue states ” and backed Obama generally by large margins .
Yet this presents yet another regional dilemma .
Simply put , the rest of the country detests Wall Street .
They see the bailout benefiting big players in cities like New York or Chicago , but doing little for smaller banks who do much of the lending outside the big money centers .
This sentiment cuts across party lines , particularly in the West and South , as the initial anti-bailout votes in the House show .
All presidents face such regional challenges in governing this vast and diverse country .
The weak politicians , like George W. Bush , tend to fall back on an ever - narrower band of regional alliances that , once threatened , easily break apart .
Transformative leaders , like Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan , learn to extend their appeal to as many industries and regions as possible .
In the next four years , we will get to see what kind of leader Barack Obama intends to be .

Carriages Made of Trash ( For Credit Crunch Babies ? )
A man from China could not afford to buy a stroller for his baby , so he decided to make one from various parts he found in garbage cans and on the street .
The resulting work can be seen in the gallery above .
" Sure it is not the most beautiful stroller and is doubtful to pass any safety inspections , but it gets the job done … and keeps the money in your pocket a little bit longer , " weirdasianews said .
With the credit crunch looming , who knows what other potential people will begin seeing in garbage .
The cluster below shows a few examples of innovative trash use .
Police on Sunday arrested a 39 - year - old married man for torching a hotel in Hokuto City , Yamanashi Prefecture , where he had canceled his wedding to another woman the same day .
Nobody was injured , police said .
Tatsuhiko Kawata was arrested for allegedly torching the hotel at 2:20 a.m. on Saturday by spreading oil on the floor in a corridor .
About 150 people , who were staying at the hotel , were evacuated .
According to police , Kawada , who is married and lives with his wife , child and his parents , booked the hotel for a wedding party to another woman which was supposed to be held on Saturday afternoon .
But he canceled the party on Sunday after he torched the hotel .
Kawata was quoted by police as saying , “ I thought I could get out of the wedding if the hotel was burned down . "
Police believe he tried to conceal the fact that he is married .

Washington D.C. , Dec. 5 , 2008 — Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson , announced a moratorium on defaults today .
“ We have been considering a moratorium on foreclosures , ” said Paulson , “ but a moratorium on defaults will be much more effective . ”
While other lawmakers are still considering foreclosure moratoriums , Paulson is convinced a default moratorium is a better approach .
He hopes others in State and Local legistlatures will follow his lead .
“ We want to keep people in their homes , ” said Paulson , “ and we need to keep our lending institutions healthy . ”
When asked how a default moratorium would help , Paulson had this to say , “ Foreclosures are the result of defaults , and defaults are also causing lenders to take write - downs on mortgage loans .
By putting a moratorium on defaults , we solve both problems . ”
Paulson provides clear guidance on how the program would work , “ Homeowners need to keep making their payments .
That will put an end to the housing crisis . ”
Experts agree that falling home values are not the root of the problem .
Paulson goes on , “ But let me emphasize that we do not need a system - wide solution for the vast majority of loans where a homeowner temporarily has negative equity .
Negative equity does not affect borrowers ’ ability to pay their loans .
Homeowners who can afford their mortgage payment should honor their obligations . ”
When pressed for more details on how such a moratorium would be implemented when so many homeowners cannot afford their payments , Paulson responded , “ We are still working on the details .
We may provide direct government assistance .
The American people are kind and generous .
They certainly wo n’t mind helping out their fellow citizens with tax dollars as necessary . ”
When confronted with the possibility of creating a moral hazard , Paulson scoffed at the notion , “ Homeowners need this help to stay in their homes .
It would be immoral to throw them out on the street . ”

I have been getting some practice writing press releases lately .
When our various politicians propose foreclosure moratoriums , do you think they are serious ?
I believe most of them are simply pandering to their constituents that want to believe they are doing something about the housing price crash .
If you give the idea of a foreclosure moratorium even a moment ’s thought , you realize it could never accomplish anything .
We just had a defacto foreclosure moratorium here in California when we instituted a new 30 - day waiting period for lenders to contact borrowers to try to work something out .
Of course , this only delayed the inevitable , but perhaps it gained some homeowners in foreclosure an extra month of free rent from the bank .
I suppose the idea is n’t any crazier than subsidising mortgage interest rates at 4.5 % .
Why not zero percent ?
Why not pay people to live in homes ?
That would probably reduce the inventory .
Any thoughts on what half - baked idea they will come up with next week ?

Barack Obama wants to find ways to make his mark quickly in the opening days of his presidency and reverse the legacy of George W. Bush .
Obama will focus his efforts on the list of executive orders that shaped White House policy , reversing them quickly .
That does not require legislative approval , but it could bring the most contentious issues to the forefront immediately and create more polarization than post - partisanship ( via Jazz Shaw ) :
Transition advisers to President - elect Barack Obama have compiled a list of about 200 Bush administration actions and executive orders that could be swiftly undone to reverse White House policies on climate change , stem cell research , reproductive rights and other issues , according to congressional Democrats , campaign aides and experts working with the transition team .
A team of four dozen advisers , working for months in virtual solitude , set out to identify regulatory and policy changes Obama could implement soon after his inauguration .
The team is now consulting with liberal advocacy groups , Capitol Hill staffers and potential agency chiefs to prioritize those they regard as the most onerous or ideologically offensive , said a top transition official who was not permitted to speak on the record about the inner workings of the transition .
In some instances , Obama would be quickly delivering on promises he made during his two - year campaign , while in others he would be embracing Clinton - era policies upended by President Bush during his eight years in office .
One suggestion might even make sense , from a states - rights perspective .
Bush signed an EO blocking California from adopting its own emissions requirements for automobiles , apart from the federal CAFE standards .
That EO was a sop to the auto industry , but it defied federalism .
If Obama rolled back that EO , it would support the federalist principle of state sovereignty and weaken , however slightly , the Commerce Clause attack on it .
The other top two targets will enrage the pro-life lobby .
Obama plans to end the federal ban on funding for human embryonic stem - cell research ( hEsc ) and upend the Mexico City rule that forbids federal foreign aid to be used to promote abortion .
He can expect a big controversy on both .
The hEsc order annoys researchers who ca n’t get money for their projects elsewhere , but that ’s because the technology has surpassed hEsc.
Scientists have since developed plenipotentiary stem cells from adult tissue , ending the need to destroy embryos at all .
If hEsc really held out any promise apart from other technologies , it would not need federal funding at any rate — it would have private donors lining up to invest in it , as other stem - cell research does .
While American voters feel some ambiguity on abortion , they overwhelmingly do not want their tax dollars paying for or facilitating abortions .
The Mexico City rule forbade federal funds to be used to facilitate the acquisition of abortions by groups abroad , much as the Hyde Amendment prohibited federal funds to be used in the same manner domestically .
If Obama rescinds it , he can expect a great deal of outrage from pro-life groups and a reopening of the debate over the use of tax money to procure abortions anywhere .
These are n’t exactly low - hanging fruit , nor are they the acts of someone who professed to find middle ground between pro-life and pro-choice groups .
These are the acts of a pro-abortion absolutist , and they presage the sponsorship of Planned Parenthood ’s Freedom of Choice Act .
So much for governing from the center .
If you 're speaking of the Christian God , then no , but that should n't matter .
You believe he created you in his image only .
Adam and Eve did not have shame until the apple thing .
It does n't matter that God sees you naked , as he has infinite knowledge , he already knows what you look like naked and probably does n't care .
It 's of no interest .
He only cares of your happiness , etc .
If you 're speaking of the Flying Spaghetti Monster , then yes .
He thinks your dangly bits are disgusting and does n't want to see them .
Just let him know in advance and he 'll overt his eyes .
If you 're speaking of some other God , then I 'm not sure .
Zues , for example , would probably ogle you and possibly attempt to have Children with you .
Mithra , whom most of the story of Jesus was based on , probably would n't care .
In the end , it 's just mythology ; Santa for adults .
I would n't concern myself with mythical sky people , Christian , pasta , or otherwise .

CLEVELAND -- National City Corp .'s top 14 executives will get as much as $ 49.5 million in payouts under the bank 's merger with PNC Financial Services Group Inc. , which closed Wednesday .
PNC 's announced the payments Wednesday , ending weeks of uncertainty about whether National City executives would receive the payouts after the $ 3.9 billion merger was complete .
PNC is buying National City with bailout money from the Treasury Department , and the legislation authorizing the bailout forbids paying " golden parachutes " to officers of banks receiving the funds .
But National
City did not receive the money and apparently is not subject to those restrictions .
PNC spokesman Brian Goerke said Wednesday that the severance agreements " were existing obligations of National City , and PNC expects to abide by them . "

• Plain Dealer Monday : Questions remain about PNC - National City deal
• Plain Dealer Sunday : PNC takeover may not be a plus for consumers
• Previous stories
Executives who stay with PNC after the merger will not receive the payments .
The closing of the merger effectively ends National City 's 163 - year history as an independent banking company .
National City agreed to the merger fearing that federal regulators would shut down the bank otherwise , according to PNC regulatory filings .
Stung by a big portfolio of bad mortgages and the slump of the financial industry , National City struggled for 18 months .
Its stock price plunged as earnings fell and regulators examined the company more thoroughly , wiping out the savings of many investors and employees .
When Congress passed emergency bailout legislation , National City Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter Raskind said regulators made it clear that National City would not get the help , forcing it to seek a buyer .
Raskind , who is leaving the company , stands to receive about $ 8.1 million in severance payments , after taxes .
He has said he would donate a large portion of the money to the Cleveland Foundation if he received it .
In an interview in October , Raskind said that selling National City was the right thing to do for shareholders , employees and customers , but that " it 's a decision that near term is going to result in some pain , a job loss of some magnitude .
It is inevitable .
We all understand that . "
He added that he and his wife agreed to redirect a " substantial portion " of any severance package back to Cleveland .
" And the Cleveland Foundation seemed like the best vehicle we could think of to do that .
It was a comfortable place , for us , to end . "
Raskind was not available for interviews Wednesday .
Other executives who apparently will get payouts are retail banking chief Daniel Frate and Executive Vice President Jon Gorney .
Frate could get $ 4.02 million after taxes and Gorney $ 3.96 million .
Goerke did not say when the payments would be made , but severance agreements with National City call for them to be paid upon the completion of a merger .
As part of the merger agreement , PNC will have to shed several branches in Western Pennsylvania .
Goerke said the company has identified which branches to sell but has not finalized any deals .
He added that PNC will make several announcements over the next few months to guide customers and employees through the transition to the new company .
Corporal Bryan Casler served with the 2nd Battalion , 6th Marines Fox Company as an infantryman from 2002 to 2006 .
In those four years , he was sent to Iraq twice and Afghanistan once .
He came back profoundly changed by his experiences , joined Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) and dedicated himself to building the antiwar movement .
But since his return and throughout his organizing activities , he says that he ’s rarely been asked about his time in Afghanistan .
“ Afghanistan was a high - stress environment , ” explains Casler .
“ We worked 100 - plus hours a week with a skeleton crew .
“ Most of us had already deployed to Iraq , and one of the striking things is that our training for Iraq and Afghanistan was n’t any different .
We treated the situation exactly like it was Iraq .
If it was really a different war with different things happening there , they would have trained us differently , but they did n’t . ”
When President - elect Barack Obama takes office in January , he has pledged to withdraw a battalion a month from Iraq–and begin a surge of U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
He has called for a renewed focus on a military victory in Afghanistan , as well as capturing or killing Osama bin Laden .
But to antiwar U.S. soldiers , Afghan civilians and even a growing portion of the Afghan elite , the consequences of a sharp increase in foreign troops in Afghanistan are predictable and dire–more civilian deaths , more soldiers in harm ’s way , and more damage to what little remains of Afghan society .
As Casler puts it , “ It ’s time for us to start talking about Afghanistan . ”
The occupation of Afghanistan is entering its eighth year , and yet the situation for the U.S. is getting worse , not better .
American casualties are rising .
The Taliban is resurgent and newly confident about challenging both U.S. troops and government forces under the command of U.S. - backed Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
At the same time , segments of the Afghan population that once expressed gratitude toward the U.S. for removing the Taliban from power and took a wait - and - see attitude toward the ongoing U.S. presence are growing increasingly angry .
The reasons are many .
First and foremost , the U.S. has increasingly relied on air strikes to suppress the growing influence of the Taliban–to a jaw - dropping extent .
U.S. fighters flew only 86 bombing raids in all of 2004 ; in 2007 , the number of air strikes grew to nearly 3,000 .
The bombing continued to rise in 2008 , with 600,000 pounds of bombs dropped on Afghanistan in June and July alone , almost equal to the amount dropped in all of 2006 .
While the Taliban has carefully avoided causing harm to civilians in areas under its control and thus succeeded in winning some new bases of support , the U.S. has used its air superiority with a recklessness that undermined what little reserve of good will remained among the Afghan population .
In early November , U.S. air strikes killed 65 civilians in a wedding party–a horrific toll but not unprecedented , as such parties , with their large concentrations of people , have been targets of air strikes in the past .
“ The Americans are hitting civilian houses all the time , ” exclaimed Mohammad Tawakil Khan , a provincial council member in Baghdis , whose two sons and a grandson were killed along with four others in a U.S. air strike the same week as the wedding party massacre .
“ They do n’t care , they just say it was a mistake … Afghan officials are only offering their condolences .
After some 100 times that they have killed civilians , we have to take revenge , and afterward say our condolences to them . ”
Beyond the carnage caused by bombs dropped by their supposed liberators , Afghans also seethe at the U.S. partnership with the warlords , militias and gangsters who make up the Northern Alliance .
Noting that Obama recently told a reporter that he felt no reason to apologize to the Afghan people , Eman , a member of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan ( RAWA ) , expressed disbelief , bitterness and anger .
“ Did n’t he feel the need to apologize for the occupation of our country under the banner of democracy , the so - called ‘ war on terror , ’ and women ’s rights , but then compromise with terrorists like the Northern Alliance , who cannot be distinguished from the Taliban in the history of their criminal acts ? ”
Eman said on KPFK ’s Uprising Radio , hosted by U.S. - based Afghan rights activist Sonali Kolhatkar .
“ In fact , these murderers were the first to destroy our nation .
And even after seven years of a very long and very costly ‘ war on terror , ’ terrorism has not been uprooted in Afghanistan , but has become stronger , and the Taliban are becoming more powerful .
From his statements during his election campaign , we do n’t think that Obama ’s position is different from the Bush administration ; it is the continuation of Bush ’s foreign policy …
“ RAWA strongly believes that whatever happens , a withdrawal of foreign troops should be the first step , because today , with the presence of thousands of troops in Afghanistan , with the presence of many foreign countries in our nation , for the majority of our people , particularly poor people in the other provinces of Afghanistan outside Kabul , the situation is so bad that it can not get any worse . ”
Ted Goodnight served in Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004 with the North Carolina Army National Guard and was stationed primarily at the Bagram Air Base , and for a time at a forward operating base near the Pakistani border .
Like Casler , his time overseas–combined with his horror at deploying to Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina fully armed to repress the people he thought he was supposed to be helping –persuaded him to end 15 years of service with the National Guard after he returned , and to join IVAW .
What he saw and heard in Afghanistan shocked him .
“ Despite all the planning and flawless execution of all the elements of a combined arms task force , based on supposedly actionable intelligence , we continually came up short–no one captured of any value , ” says Goodnight .
“ I thought there ’s something wrong with this picture , so I asked my company commander why we kept coming up short .
Was it an intelligence failure ?
Or something else ?
And the response that I got was that these were simply shows of force , that in reality there were no legitimate targets .
“ I also remember the various snatch - and - grabs of Afghans that the military carried out .
They would come off the helicopters with their handcuffs and leg shackles and hoods over their heads , and were led into this compound , where they were never seen or heard from by us again .
“ I remember being in the dining facility and overhearing conversations between military police personnel who were in charge of interrogations , and they were bragging among themselves about their brutality –who could be more intimidating and more demeaning to the detainees .
“ This was about dehumanization .
They were n’t people .
They were acronyms , PUCs , ‘ persons under control . ’
So we were not only harassing the population through giant shows of military force , but also through thuggish intimidation , kidnapping and abuse of detainees .
We were there simply as an occupying force . ”
Goodnight says that the U.S. totally failed to deliver on any of its promises to provide humanitarian relief .
“ We have n’t provided any significant assistance to the farmers who make up the majority of the labor force in Afghanistan , ” he said .
“ We have n’t put forth any real effort to provide alternative crops , so the only option has been to turn to opium production , which the Taliban had largely eliminated before the U.S. came in and kicked them out .
“ The humanitarian efforts that we have undertaken have been primarily carried out by contractors who perform shoddy work with foreign workers .
The majority of the population needs that income and those jobs , so how are we supposed to win hearts and minds with construction efforts using foreign contractors and foreign workers when the population , which is capable of skilled construction work , is left by the wayside ? ”
The bombings and callous disregard for civilian life , the routine abuse and mistreatment of detainees , the lack of humanitarian assistance–all of this explains , according to Goodnight , why the Taliban has been able to reassert itself in Afghanistan .
“ The Taliban represents an alternative , ” says Goodnight .
“ They say to the people –you know what we ’ve done .
We provided stability and security , and yes , we were brutal in the enforcement of religious laws , but we provided more for the people and the farmers than the U.S. has or will .
So the people figure that they prefer the lesser of two evils–which in this case is in the Taliban . ”
But does n’t the U.S. have the right to pursue Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda to wipe out the terrorist threat ?
As Casler says , it ’s a mistake “ to hold an entire country responsible for the actions of a few people .
It would n’t make sense to hold the entire American population responsible for Timothy McVeigh ’s actions or the Unabomber , would it ?
“ Retaliation against Afghanistan for the attack by Osama bin Laden never made sense to me , but during my time in the military , I never questioned what I was told to do .
So when we went to Afghanistan , it did n’t matter why .
They could have told me we ’re going into Wisconsin , and I would have done it .
The definition of discipline is instant willing obedience to orders , and you strive to have discipline in the military . ”
Matthis Chiroux was sent to Afghanistan for a week as an Army reporter in 2005 , and he is now fighting the U.S. military ’s attempt to reactivate and deploy him involuntarily to Iraq .
He echoes Casler ’s sentiments .
“ Osama bin Laden is not Afghani , and he was n’t acting on behalf of the Afghani people or the state of Afghanistan , ” says Chiroux .
“ He was supported by their government , which we ourselves also supported , just as we supported Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
How many more Afghanis must die for us to stop being terrified ? ”
In fact , every Afghan killed by the U.S. is used as a recruiting pitch by both the Taliban and al - Qaeda–and it ’s working .
“ The inherent and unjust nature of foreign occupation does far more to foment terrorism than cool it , ” says Chiroux .
“ An occupied Afghanistan will never submit , and it should n’t . ”
Even before the September 11 attacks , the U.S. had issued threats against Afghanistan ’s Taliban regime , which Washington once considered benign but later deemed an obstacle to its plans for controlling the shipment and distribution of oil and natural gas resources in Central Asia .
The 9/11 attacks became more than just a pretext for the invasion of Afghanistan .
The “ war on terror ” has become the justification for a series of interventions and potential military interventions in the service of an American empire .
This is the crucial context for understanding the meaning of an escalation of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan .
“ Obama ’s plan to shift troops into Afghanistan and then bring the aerial war into Iraq is bringing another failed policy and a failed tactic into a country already devastated by occupation , ” says Casler .
“ I ’d personally like to see the removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq , and some real reparations for the people of both these countries , not just ‘ reparations ’ at the end of the barrel of a gun .
“ I ’m actively campaigning to include Afghanistan as part of IVAW ’s points of unity , but if the organization as a whole does n’t vote that through , I ’m of course going to continue my organizing against the war in Iraq .
But we have to understand that there are a lot of Afghanistan veterans who want to see immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan and reparations for the Afghan people , just as in Iraq .
“ It ’s up to everybody to educate themselves about Afghanistan .
We ’ve been so hyper - focused on Iraq that the issue of Afghanistan has n’t been brought up as much as it should have .
But we are fighting two wars every single day .
“ Whether we like it or not , Afghanistan is going to be thrust into the public eye , and I hope we ’re prepared to provide context for what ’s going on there when that happens . ”
The original iPod was announced in October 2001 .
The device eventually changed the soundscape of the music industry .
* Stan Musilek / * Wired View Slideshow 2001 : Apple rolls out the iPod , eventually propelling the company to dominance in the digital - music field and changing the music industry forever .
Apple 's Steve Jobs , who tends to overuse superlatives ( " the best ever , " " it ’ll put a ding in the universe " ) , was not far off the mark with the iPod .
Despite some conspicuous flaws — a wonky scroll wheel , no Windows compatibility , short battery life and a whopping $ 400 price tag — this innocuous - looking device was indeed a game - changer .
The iPod was not the first MP3 player , but its simple interface and internal hard drive ( which evolved to flash memory in later models ) set a new standard .
Another advantage was integration with the easy - to - use iTunes software .
Later , support for Apple 's massive iTunes library provided iPod customers ( Beatles fans excepted ) with a vast trove of music to populate their players .
From conception to completion , it took Apple engineers and designers just under a year to come up with the original iPod player .
It featured a 5 GB hard drive and was capable of playing music in several audio file formats .
Jobs announced the iPod to the world with his usual sly flourish :
The iPod " puts a thousand songs in your pocket . "
That 's exactly what it did , with more efficiency and elegance than any MP3 player that preceded it .
Still , the iPod was not an overnight success .
Early sales were sluggish , and it was n't until 2004 that the millionth iPod was sold .
Things took off after the release of a version for Windows , followed by the rapid introduction of new models , such as the Mini , the Shuffle and the Nano .
Once it gained momentum , the iPod 's dominance of digital music led to profound changes in the music industry , a cloistered fraternity notoriously resistant to change .
Mainly , the iPod allowed Apple to blow up the industry 's CD - based business model , by making the downloading of singles both cheap and easy .
Among other things , there was grumbling from music execs over the fact that people were able to rip their previously purchased CDs into their iTunes libraries without having to pay extra for the privilege .
As a result of this and the general advance of technology , the music industry is in the painful process of reinventing itself .
Whatever emerges , iTunes , now easily the world 's biggest music retailer , will have to be part of the equation .
Sales of the iPod peaked in early 2008 , with more than 20 million of them clearing the shelves during Apple 's first quarter .
Not coincidentally , it was the most profitable quarter in company history .
Today , in all its variations , the iPod commands both the U.S. and foreign MP3 markets .
It accounts for roughly three of every four digital music players sold in the United States .
This kind of dominance tends to be self - perpetuating , and Apple has capitalized accordingly , cutting deals with a slew of stereo manufacturers , carmakers and even airlines to make the iPod the music player of choice , thereby ensuring its continued place at the head of the table .

Intel 's New Green Processor Offers $ 2 Billion In Energy Savings
November 1st , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
Intel ’s new microprocessor was designed with the environment in mind .
The company says the chip is not only rocket fast but is also extremely energy efficient .
The chip — code named Nehalem — follows the Intel Core II and IV series processors .
[ social_buttons ]
“ Going into this project … we insisted on energy efficiency … and power , ” said Steve Gunther , an engineer for Intel .
Adding more processing speed to a chip often requires pulling a lot more energy .
Meeting this challenge was not an easy one , he notes .
Nehalem engineers had to tweak both the chip ’s clock cycle and its operating voltage , both of which typically eat up a lot of energy .
The biggest energy cut came from reducing usage on an idle machine ; a lot of the chip ’s life - cycle is spent idle .
So that makes sense , if you ’re not in the room …turn off the lights .
There ’s a catch , though .
The chip still needs to be “ active ” enough to receive instructions .
Historically , chips remained fully powered during the idle stage in order to catch any instructions thrown their way — not anymore .
Intel estimates that switching to Nehalem processors could save $ 2 billion dollars in energy costs and up to 20 terawatt hours .
The company also suggests that 2 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions globally are from computers .
Maybe it ’s time to upgrade ?

A woman who authorities said once tried to become a contestant on “ American Idol ” was found dead outside the Sherman Oaks home of “ Idol ” judge Paula Abdul in a case police are investigating as a possible suicide .
Authorities identified the woman as Paula Goodspeed , 30 , from Thousand Oaks .
( Police earlier had said her name was spelled “ Goodespeed . ” )
Goodspeed was found dead in a car about 6 p.m. Tuesday outside the house in the 3800 block of Beverly Ridge Drive .
“ We are investigating the case as a possible suicide , ” said Ed Winter , a spokesman for the coroner ’s office .
The cause of death will not be determined until after toxicology tests are completed , he added .
A law enforcement source , who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case , said the woman was familiar to officials with the Los Angeles Police Department ’s threat management unit , which investigates stalking cases , but he declined to elaborate .
Abdul , a singer and former Laker girl , is best known in recent years as a judge on the popular “ American Idol ” TV show .
A video of Goodspeed ’s appearance at an “ Idol ” tryout shows her singing “ Proud Mary ” in a pink dress .
“ Idol ” panelist Simon Cowell remarked that Goodspeed looked a lot like Abdul .

The switch never had anything to do with politics , everyone involved insists .
So chalk it up to karmic coincidence , that Google Maps ' once - blurry overhead views of the Vice President 's residence suddenly cleared up , just when Dick Cheney was finally leaving the building .
For years , the press and the ' net - going public ribbed Cheney , for the pixelated pictures of his official home , by Washington 's National Observatory .
Other important locations inside the Beltway could seen seen clearly in Google Maps and Google Earth ; the fact the Cheney 's place was blurred seemed like a perfect metaphor for his secretive nature .
But Google reps tell Valleywag that they did n't have anything to do with the smudges .
The U.S. Geological Survey took the aerial imagery , and made the decision to blur .
Once Google got satellite pictures of the area , from the Digital Globe eye - in - orbit , they uploaded the better quality pics .
I talked to some folks in the satellite business , who confirmed the sequence .
So there 's no conspiracy surrounding our now - former VP .
At least this once .
By the way , Sharon wrote back in July a really fascinating overview ( excuse the pun ) of the national security implications of all this overhead imagery .

There 's a lot about the next iteration of the open - source Firefox browser to be geeked out about .
From private browsing modes to tab preview panels , from punchier colors to really smart session restoring , there 's been a lot of thought put into how people want to use the web .
But perhaps the greatest promise in Firefox 3.1 is the one most users wo n't see at all — a serious overhaul of the browser 's JavaScript engine , newly christened as TraceMonkey .
If you do n't obsessively follow the Mozilla developer 's blogs or read insider tech news , you might have a few questions about TraceMonkey — like , say , what 's different about it , how much faster is it , why that matters , and how you can try it out right now .
We 've compiled a primer on TraceMonkey 's features and uses , as well as how to experience it .
Read on to see what 's new under the hood in the upcoming Firefox .
Graph via Brendan 's Roadmap Updates .

What is TraceMonkey ?
The answer to that question that everyone can understand is , " It 's the new JavaScript engine in Firefox 3.1 , and it's a lot faster . "
The slightly geekier answer is that TraceMonkey is a descendant of SpiderMonkey , the first - ever JavaScript engine written for Ye Olde Netscape web browser .
TraceMonkey uses " just in time " methods to understand and execute commands given to it by Ajax - heavy sites like Gmail , Facebook , and other webapps that can manipulate data without requiring a page refresh .
One Mozilla exec told Ars Technica that TraceMonkey represents " performance improvements ranging between 20 and 40 times faster in some cases . "
Okay , for the truly geeky amongst you : TraceMonkey uses " an alternative compilation strategy in which no controlflow graph is ever constructed , but in which relevant ( i.e. , frequently executed ) control flows are instead discovered lazily during execution . "
Or , rather than spend processor time trying to determine all the ways a certain if / when command can be executed , Trace Monkey just guns through it at first , generating the code it needs to run .
As soon as the command turns out a different result , or another path becomes " hot , " the compiler re-figures code for all the different paths .
So TraceMonkey moves quickly to figure out at least one path through a maze of code , or a " trace tree , " and offers it up to the user ASAP .
Think of it as an impulsive chess player , versus the guy who takes all afternoon to run out every scenario under the sun .
Need a better explanation than this CSE drop - out can provide ?
Try Andreas Gal's TraceMonkey FAQ post , or this PDF whitepaper from the University of California , Irvine , describing trace tree methodology .
Or check out the video below , queued up to the relevant TraceMonkey portion of a BarCamp presentation by Gen Kanai :
How much do milliseconds really matter ?
In short , plenty .
JavaScript has become a predominant technology amongst today 's web developers , and Mozilla — along with pretty much every web browser maker out there — aims to make it just as fast as code that runs on your desktop .
The closer everyone gets to that kind of speed , the closer the idea of the Web as Desktop gets to reality .
This is handily demonstrated in a video demonstration of online photo editing over at Mozilla 's site .
With just - in - time compiling , actions the user takes on a web program move along as if being adjusted in a desktop app , as opposed to having to basically re-load an entire JavaScript app and figure out what state it 's in .
Oh , but you 're the numbers - and - graphs type , right ?
Mozilla has posted TraceMonkey benchmarks run on Apple 's SunSpider tester back in August .
Here 's the basic overview graph :

And here 's TraceMonkey pitted against Google Chrome 's much - touted V8 JavaScript engine , run by Mozilla on the same SunSpider benchmark suite :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Now this is , as even Mozilla points out , just one test of JavaScript speed , and you 're only seeing what Firefox 's developers have publicly displayed .
I tried running a TraceMonkey - enabled Firefox 3.1 build through the same Celtic Kane JavaScript test I used in our browser speed tests ( one which at least one Firefox developer has expressed serious doubts about ) , but the results came back pretty noticeably off - key — timing out at 10 times slower than Chrome , or even Firefox 3.0 .
From human observation , I can say that Gmail did seem a good deal snappier using TraceMonkey , and Facebook 's mini - feed on my main page seemed to start folding down the page the instant the web page was called up .
Of course , I 'm using the highly - variable Windows Vista , and my Firefox 3.1 build was running no add - ons or external plug-ins .
Still , it seems like Mozilla 's claims are n't just inside - ball developer braggery — this monkey is a swift one .

So I should get ready to switch to Firefox 3.1 ?
We 're never shy about touting an open - source , highly - extendable browser , so feel free to try it out when it drops ( or look below for help on giving it a test without disturbing your regular Firefox ) .
But given how all the code for Firefox is available to anyone , Firefox 's SpiderMonkey engine is already being used in Yahoo Widgets , an offline Ultima Online server emulator , the JavaScript elements of the Windows - in - Linux WINE project , and likely a good number of other spots .
If Trace Monkey 's speed makes a noticeable impact , you 'll likely see it put into place in those places and many more , and other browsers might just pick up on it as a mainstay or option , or at least develop their own versions .

Okay , I 'm sold .
How do I get TraceMonkey in my Firefox ?

Our intrepid ( and Firefox - loving ) intern AsianAngel has done the good work of detailing how to test out TraceMonkey without touching Firefox or any other browser you 've got installed over at her blog .
You 're basically installing a copy of Portable Firefox , then grabbing the latest beta build of Firefox 3.1 with TraceMonkey enabled and installing it into the guts of that Portable Firefox folder .
Note that 3.1 comes with TraceMonkey enabled by default for web content , but you can also have TraceMonkey be the go - to handler for browser chrome ( i.e. toolbars and display ) and add - ons by enabling it in about : config .
Your take
We 've certainly said ( and shown ) our piece on TraceMonkey , but we 're just one team of bloggers , albeit a highly geeky one .
We want to hear from our bleeding - edge fans how TraceMonkey is working in the wilds of the web , so tell us your take in the comments .
Container shippers are unleashing a wave of titanic vessels on the oceans during the biggest dip in global trade since World War II .
The trend could keep sea freight rates depressed well into 2010 .
That 's good news for their customers , the millions of businesses big and small that import parts and products from overseas .
But it 's likely to spell pain within the shipping industry itself and could precipitate consolidation as smaller players are pushed out .

More than 3,400 companies are in the solar energy sector and employ about 25,000 to 35,000 workers , including installers , manufacturers , distributors and project developers and materials suppliers .
“ We estimate that will grow to more than 110,000 direct solar jobs by 2016 , ” said Monique Hanis , a spokeswoman for the organization .
Solar workers install thermal collectors , which convert the sun ’s rays into heat used to supply buildings with hot water , for heating and cooling systems and to warm swimming pools .
They also install solar panels to convert the sun ’s rays into electricity that can power things like appliances and lights .
When more electricity is being produced than the customer is using , the excess can be stored in batteries for use at other times .
When batteries are full , the surplus electricity can be exported back to the electrical grid if the building is connected to it , offsetting electricity costs from the utility company .
Consumers are turning to solar energy for various reasons , including , of course , the idea that solar power creates no carbon emissions .
And many people feel that solar power is important in reducing the dependence of the United States on foreign oil .
Some even see a roof festooned with solar panels as an ecological status symbol .
Beyond all of that , government subsidies can reduce the cost of installing solar panels .
Bob Cowen of Morris County , N.J. , chose solar panels for his roof for both ecological and economic reasons .
To outfit his home with 49 solar panels , he paid $ 64,700 , minus rebates of $ 42,500  for an out - of - pocket cost of $ 22,200 .

I 've Seen the Future , and It Has a Kill Switch
It used to be that just the entertainment industries wanted to control your computers — and televisions and iPods and everything else — to ensure that you did n’t violate any copyright rules .
But now everyone else wants to get their hooks into your gear .
OnStar will soon include the ability for the police to shut off your engine remotely .
Buses are getting the same capability , in case terrorists want to re-enact the movie Speed .
The Pentagon wants a kill switch installed on airplanes , and is worried about potential enemies installing kill switches on their own equipment .
Microsoft is doing some of the most creative thinking along these lines , with something it ’s calling “ Digital Manners Policies . ”
According to its patent application , DMP - enabled devices would accept broadcast “ orders ” limiting their capabilities .
Cellphones could be remotely set to vibrate mode in restaurants and concert halls , and be turned off on airplanes and in hospitals .
Cameras could be prohibited from taking pictures in locker rooms and museums , and recording equipment could be disabled in theaters .
Professors finally could prevent students from texting one another during class .
The possibilities are endless , and very dangerous .
Making this work involves building a nearly flawless hierarchical system of authority .
That ’s a difficult security problem even in its simplest form .
Distributing that system among a variety of different devices — computers , phones , PDAs , cameras , recorders — with different firmware and manufacturers , is even more difficult .
Not to mention delegating different levels of authority to various agencies , enterprises , industries and individuals , and then enforcing the necessary safeguards .
Once we go down this path — giving one device authority over other devices — the security problems start piling up .
Who has the authority to limit functionality of my devices , and how do they get that authority ?
What prevents them from abusing that power ?
Do I get the ability to override their limitations ?
In what circumstances , and how ?
Can they override my override ?
How do we prevent this from being abused ?
Can a burglar , for example , enforce a “ no photography ” rule and prevent security cameras from working ?
Can the police enforce the same rule to avoid another Rodney King incident ?
Do the police get “ superuser ” devices that cannot be limited , and do they get “ supercontroller ” devices that can limit anything ?
How do we ensure that only they get them , and what do we do when the devices inevitably fall into the wrong hands ?
It ’s comparatively easy to make this work in closed specialized systems — OnStar , airplane avionics , military hardware — but much more difficult in open - ended systems .
If you think Microsoft ’s vision could possibly be securely designed , all you have to do is look at the dismal effectiveness of the various copy - protection and digital - rights - management systems we ’ve seen over the years .
That ’s a similar capabilities - enforcement mechanism , albeit simpler than these more general systems .
And that ’s the key to understanding this system .
Do n’t be fooled by the scare stories of wireless devices on airplanes and in hospitals , or visions of a world where no one is yammering loudly on their cellphones in posh restaurants .
This is really about media companies wanting to exert their control further over your electronics .
They not only want to prevent you from surreptitiously recording movies and concerts , they want your new television to enforce good “ manners ” on your computer , and not allow it to record any programs .
They want your iPod to politely refuse to copy music to a computer other than your own .
They want to enforce their legislated definition of manners : to control what you do and when you do it , and to charge you repeatedly for the privilege whenever possible .
“ Digital Manners Policies ” is a marketing term .
Let ’s call this what it really is : Selective Device Jamming .
It ’s not polite , it ’s dangerous .
It wo n’t make anyone more secure — or more polite .

Iran arrests 49 of its citizens for wearing ' satanic ' Western - style clothes and haircuts
Police in Iran have arrested 49 people this week in a crackdown on ' satanic ' Western - style clothes and haircuts .
It is part of a nation - wide campaign to stop the spread of Western cultural influence in the Islamic republic , where strict dress codes are enforced .
' Police confronted rascals and thugs who appeared in public wearing satanic fashions and unsuitable clothing , ' said Qaemshahr city police commander Mahmoud Rahmani .
He added that five barber shops were shut and 20 more warned for ' promoting Western hairstyles ' .
Authorities in Iran , where a strict dress code is enforced , want to protect young Iranians , such as the two men above , from the influence of Western culture
In the past , such crackdowns have lasted a few weeks or months , but the current campaign was launched in 2007 and has not let up .
It includes measures against men sporting spiky ' Western ' hairstyles or women
wearing tight trousers and high boots .
Women are supposed to wear clothing that covers their hair and disguises the shape of their bodies .
But some , particularly in cities , wear headscarves pushed back well beyond their hairlines and sport tight - fitting outfits .
Some analysts say the authorities fear such open acts of defiance against the Islamic Republic 's values could escalate if they go unchecked .
' Some individuals , not knowing what culture they are imitating , put on clothing that was designed by the enemies of this country , ' Mr Rahmani said .
' The enemies of this country are trying to divert our youth and breed them the way they want and deprive them of a healthy life , ' he added .
He did not say how the offenders would be punished .
Usual penalties are a warning or a fine .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has in the past suggested Iran 's enemies may try to stage a ' soft ' or ' velvet ' revolution by infiltrating corrupt culture or ideas .

Bogota
For Afro-Colombians evicted from their land in north - western Colombia and along the Pacific coast , the loss of familiar surroundings of lush jungle and rugged mountains can be devastating .
Many families have faced eviction from their land Take Yajaira , a slender 18 - year - old , one of four children whose family was displaced from a settlement in the Cacarica river basin just south of Colombia 's border with Panama .
She misses her place of origin deeply .
" My home was surrounded by banana and mango trees , and coconut palms , " she recalls , fingering a bracelet she wears made of seeds and feathers gathered in tropical forests .
" We used to bathe and fish in a nearby stream . "
Currently , Yayaira spends part of the year in Bogota , Colombia 's Andean capital , where blue - black clouds seem to hover perpetually over the city .
It often rains and it is cold , in sharp contrast to the sultry heat of the north - west .
Tens of thousands of other displaced Afro-Colombians are also dispersed in Colombian cities .
Many live precariously in sprawling shantytowns , such as Ciudad Bolivar , in the south of the capital .
" A peasant without land is like a being without life , " Yajaira says , clearly not convinced by the urban existence .
" We do n't know how to live in towns . "
Displaced , black and poor Talking to Jose Caceido , another displaced Afro-Colombian , there is so much tension in the air it almost seems as if you could cut it with a knife .
Mr Caceido , in his early 30s , says he moved to Bogota in 2001 after being threatened by presumed paramilitaries in Tumaco , a Pacific coast region .
Afro-Colombian children grow up in the cities , far from their parents ' land " We have been discriminated against in three ways , " he says with steely restraint .
" We are displaced , we are black and we are poor . "
It is Mr Caceido 's view that underlying the displacement of countless Afro-Colombians is a clash in values between the communities ' use of the land and an initiative of Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to produce more palm oil for biodiesel .
For Afro-Colombians , Mr Caceido says , land use is based on cultivating a few traditional crops for subsistence - such as corn , yucca and cocoa - or for hunting and fishing .
But , according to human rights organisations working in the north - west Choco province , and in dense forests along the Pacific , paramilitary gangs are seizing Afro-Colombian land to facilitate biofuel conglomerates .
The land is also being transformed , with elaborate network of highways , drainage canals and palm oil plantation sites .
Tropical forests are cut down , water sources diverted , to aid the development of agribusiness projects .
The changes make it harder for the Afro-Colombians to ever recover their former way of life , observes Mr Caceido .
" Once palm oil is planted we cannot hunt anymore because the animals have fled , " he says .
" There is no more birdsong because the forests have been cut down .
The soil hardens for lack of shade .
Rivers dry up .
Nothing else grows except palm . "
Source of revenue President Uribe 's government is pinning a lot of hopes on its palm oil strategy , however .
Afro-Caribbean protesters have taken action against the palm oil growers
The government says it wants the area planted with the crop to increase tenfold in the next decade to more than three million hectares , or some seven million acres .
It believes the cash crop , which is also used in many foods , will be a viable source of revenue for the government .
It hopes bio - diesel will solve air pollution in cities .
It is confident it can be an economic alternative to the cultivation of coca , the raw material of cocaine , for many Colombian farmers .
Not banned
But the increasing deforestation and humanitarian costs associated with President Uribe 's policy have led human rights organisations and many concerned observers to ask : what went wrong ?
According to the Inter - Church Justice and Peace Commission , ( ICJPC ) , a human rights organisation , a fundamental problem is that paramilitary gangs , apparently funded by the drugs trade and listed by Washington as terrorist organisations , have not been disbanded in Choco and the Pacific region .
In many other parts of the country , they have been banned under a government security plan .
" The paramilitaries re-engineered themselves , " says Danilo Rueda , a founding member of ICJPC and a lawyer who represents Afro-Colombian families from Choco at hearings of the Inter - American Court of Human Rights .
" The same ones that started protecting businessmen , and which participated in military campaigns against leftwing guerillas in Choco , are the ones that have illegally taken control of land belonging to Afro-Colombians and who threaten Afro-Colombians trying to recover their land , " he insists .
Brutal evictions
The ways in which Afro-Colombians have been forced off their land in Choco and in the Pacific region have not been remotely subtle .
Dozens of peasant farmers who have refused to sell or relinquish their holdings , or who are community representatives , have been murdered .
One recent case is Ualberto Hoyos , a family farmer and community leader , who was murdered by two presumed paramilitaries on 14 October in an execution - style killing with a shot through the head .
Stepping up the pressure on the communities , human rights organisations that defend Afro-Colombian rights have also begun to be targeted .
Afro-Colombians harvesting rice on their own land In September an ICJPC field worker was kidnapped .
" It is complicated to dismantle [ the paramilitaries ] , " says Luc Gerar , president of Tribeca Partners , a private equity firm in Bogota .
" They have a lot of connections .
Often , the police or the army trained them .
Some are ex-police and ex-army .
They have a lot of money and weapons . "
Mr Rueda says this situation is a reflection of the immunity enjoyed by the paramilitaries .
" The businessmen continue in the area , cutting down the fruit from the palm trees and extracting the oil .
They continue to exploit Afro- Colombian lands that do not belong to them , " he claims .
" In 99 % of the cases there has been no clarification , no punishing of the guilty , no sanctions . "

Israel has said the aim of the past three days of intense bombing in Gaza is to stop rockets being fired by Palestinian militants into southern Israeli towns .
The rockets have claimed 19 lives in the past eight years , but have become an increasingly serious problem for the Israeli government .
To reduce the rocket fire , Israeli military analysts argue , is a modest goal .
However , even within Israel there remain sharp differences of opinion about how to achieve that .
Most believe the latest conflict will eventually end with a new lull in the fighting , or at best another short - term ceasefire agreement - the latest in a long line of temporary ceasefires in the conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza .
Although Israel has put in place some preparations for a ground invasion , including preparing a call - up of reserves and deploying tanks near the Gaza border , that is still not seen as an inevitable step .
Shlomo Brom , a retired Israeli general and a military analyst at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv , said the point of the conflict was for Israel to exact the best conditions for a future ceasefire with Hamas , the Islamist movement which controls Gaza after winning Palestinian elections three years ago .
" The military operation is changing the dynamic , making it clear to Hamas that it is going to pay a very high cost for violations of the ceasefire , " Brom said .
" I think Hamas deluded itself by thinking Israel is kind of paralysed because of its political system or the possible reaction of its population to some suffering . "
For nearly six months Israel and Hamas held a ceasefire in Gaza , although it broke down in the final weeks with violations on both sides .
Now both Hamas and some Israeli leaders have said they are not willing to return to a ceasefire deal .
Ehud Barak , Israel 's defence minister , told Fox News on Saturday when the bombing began : " For us to be asked to have a ceasefire with Hamas is like asking you [ the US ] to have a ceasefire with al - Qaida . "
The reality is that a new ceasefire agreement is probably the best Israel could hope to achieve .
As Alex Fishman , a columnist on the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper , put it bluntly yesterday : " The answer to the question of what we want is simple : To stop the fire .
In order to stop the fire , we have to reach an arrangement , and in order to persuade Hamas to reach an arrangement , we are now breaking its bones - among other reasons , so that the price it demands will not be high .
But we have not yet decided , amongst ourselves , what price we are willing to pay . "
Yet there are others who raise broader questions about Israel 's policy towards Gaza , particularly in the last three years since Hamas won the electoral victory .
Yossi Alpher , a former official at Mossad and a military commentator , agreed that Israel was seeking a ceasefire on more acceptable terms .
But he was critical of the tough economic blockade Israel has imposed on the Gaza Strip in recent years , limiting imports to humanitarian supplies and preventing all exports , a policy that has all but wiped out private industry and brought Gaza 's economy to collapse .
" The economic siege of Gaza has not produced any of the desired political results , " he said .
" It has not manipulated Palestinians into hating Hamas , but has probably been counter - productive .
It is just useless collective punishment . "
He said that in future Israel would have to choose either to recognise Hamas was around to stay and to talk to the movement , however unpalatable that might be for most Israelis , or to fully reoccupy the Gaza Strip , topple Hamas and bear all the costs involved .
Some have even spoken publicly against the current bombing in Gaza .
Tom Segev , one of Israel 's most respected historians , has been particularly critical , arguing that the premise of bombing to secure a peace agreement was false .
" Israel has also always believed that causing suffering to Palestinian civilians would make them rebel against their national leaders .
This assumption has proven wrong over and over , " Segev wrote in yesterday 's Ha'aretz newspaper .
" Since the dawn of the Zionist presence in the land of Israel , no military operation has ever advanced dialogue with the Palestinians . "
Computing : Netbooks are small computers that are cheaper and lighter than full - scale laptops .
They have their merits — but do not ask too much of them
STEVE JOBS says
Apple does not know how to make a $ 500 computer “ that 's not a piece of junk ” .
Yet this article was written on a small computer that costs less than that — and barely a quarter of the price of the Apple iMac that sits on the desk beside it .
Small , cheap mini-notebooks like this , or “ netbooks ” as they have come to be called , are not as fast or as capable as a big computer like an iMac , and in performance terms they trail behind most laptops .
But they are certainly not junk , and for some people they may be the best computers money can buy .
Netbooks are a hot - selling consumer product .
The first to appear on the market , a year or so ago , were aimed at children .
But now they are proving popular not just with families and first - time computer buyers but also with power users who want something small , lightweight and cheap .
They typically have screens measuring seven to ten inches diagonally .
They have built - in wireless networking , but lack an optical drive for CDs or DVDs .
Some use flash memory for storage instead of a hard disk , which makes them more robust and extends battery life .
Netbooks generally cost less than $ 500 .
IDC , a market - research firm , reckons worldwide sales of netbooks will reach 10.8 m in 2008 and more than 20 m in 2009 , during which they will represent 11 - 12 % of the entire laptop market .
Keep it simple
Most current models , including Samsung 's NC10 , much of the Asus Eee range , the MSI Wind and the Acer Aspire One , use Intel 's Atom as their central processor .
This is the chipmaker 's smallest processor , designed specifically for low - cost and portable devices , not for intensive number - crunching .
But because a lot of things that people do with computers , such as e-mail , writing and web browsing , do not require fancy graphics or lots of processing power , netbooks can still be extremely useful .
The number of netbooks available is growing as more producers pile into the market ( but not Apple — at least , not yet ) .
But if you are buying one , avoid the temptation to get the slickest , most powerful machine available .
Much advice on offer online suggests souping up the specification of a netbook so it can run Microsoft 's Windows XP operating system , rather than the free , open - source Linux system that is offered as standard on many netbooks .
Yet increasing the specification only makes sense for people who want to run ( and to pay for ) Windows and specific Windows - based applications .
The extra hardware and software costs start to push the price of a netbook towards that of a standard laptop , which will invariably be better because it has a bigger processor and superior graphics .
For many users , the basic , free software shipped with a netbook will be quite enough .
The most basic model of the Acer Aspire One can be found for £ 179 in Britain and around $ 300 in America .
It simply switches on and runs with the minimum of fuss .
It has 8 gigabytes ( GB ) of flash storage and 512 megabytes of RAM , which is a bit puny .
But that is perfectly adequate to run the customised version of Linux that comes pre-installed on it , along with a suite of software , including Open Office .
With no hard drive , and a switch to turn off the wireless connection ( not the fastest in the world ) , power can be conserved .
So a bigger , bulkier battery may not be necessary either , unless you want to use the computer untethered for long periods .
Because it boots up in a few seconds , rather than thinking of the Acer as a mini laptop it might make more sense to view it as a beefed - up personal digital assistant , such as an old PalmPilot or Psion , but with a better screen and a proper keyboard .
But what about the lack of storage ?
Again , the way the machine can be used addresses this problem .
First , netbooks are designed to be used with the net , which is where an increasing number of people now store a lot of their stuff , such as e-mail , videos and photos , and where people do other work with online applications .
Second , with three USB ports it can always be plugged into devices , such as a portable hard drive , to store things locally .
Storage space can also be boosted by plugging a small SD - card flash memory ( 16GB versions are now widely available ) into one of two ports , one of which is designated to act as semi-permanent storage .
As for the software , Open Office was surprisingly easy to use — a doddle for anyone who has used Microsoft Office .
Moreover , the ability to save work in different formats presented no compatibility problems when sending files to a Windows - based machine .
Photo software and other applications were simple to use too .
The machine is not up to much for playing games , but then a dedicated games console beats most computers when it comes to games anyway .
The Acer has a built - in webcam , which makes it ideal for video - calling services such as Skype .
Admittedly , installing third - party software can be a bit of a fiddle , and some of the advice available online threatens to lure users into the tangled depths of the Linux undergrowth , where few people will want to venture .
But as netbooks become more prevalent , such difficulties are likely to ease .
The upshot is that netbooks are great as cheap , simple and small computers for performing basic tasks — especially if the pre-installed software does what you want it to .
They will never satisfy power users who want to edit video and play elaborate games , but they are not meant to .
Provided they do not expect too much , most users will be delighted with them .
Its beers are a staple at beer lovers ’ haunts like Barcade in Williamsburg and Jimmy ’s No. 43 in the East Village .
Gramercy Tavern pours Sixpoint , and Lil’ Frankie ’s in the East Village has a pale ale custom - made to suit its pizza .
The roster has recently grown to include a dozen bars in New Jersey and about 30 in Massachusetts .
At Bierkraft , in Park Slope , where draft beer is sold by the half - gallon growler jug , “ every third person who walks in the door asks for Sixpoint , ” according to Ben Granger , an owner .
It ’s the top - selling draft beer at Whole Foods on Houston Street , too , with over 200 growlers sold in an average week .

For Mr. Welch , who moved to New York from Wisconsin , situating Sixpoint in Brooklyn was a deliberate choice .
“ We were n’t able to identify any other place in the country that we thought would be as receptive to the type of beers we wanted to make , ” he said .
“ Brooklyn had a history of producing beautiful handcrafted stuff , and it was having a creative renaissance . ”
If there ’s a unifying character among the various Sixpoint beers , he said , it would arise from “ the positive attitudes of the people who work here . ”
Or it could be the house strain of yeast , a fast - acting agent called 007 that quickly ferments the sugars in the malt , yielding potent brews , and then settles out easily when it has done its work , so there is no need to filter the beers for clarity .
The 007 also accentuates the flavor of hops , like Sixpoint ’s favored citrusy Yakima breeds .
As a result , Sixpoint beers are quite hoppy .
To compensate , beers such as Sweet Action start with a complement of sweeter malts .
The mellow Brownstone ale uses 11 different malts , where most commercial beers get by on just a few .
As Mr. Welch explained the process , he reached down into a sack of honey malt to offer me a sample : little grains with the full , malty sweetness of Whoppers and a subtle cereal tang .
He continued nibbling on them as he reflected on Sixpoint ’s progress .

The police officer who seemingly randomly picked a bicyclist out of a critical mass crowd to tackle has been indicted for falsifying records and could also soon be charged with misdemeanor assault .
The YouTube video [ below ] , which went viral soon after the incident , was instrumental in the indictment .
The officer claimed that the bicyclist had shoved him before the officer tackled him back , but the video shows no such incident .
Critical Mass is held on the last Friday of every month in over 300 cities across the world .
Bicyclists join together for a cross-city ride moving as one unit and often disobeying traffic laws .
The movement is intended to allow bicyclists , who typically must watch out for cars on the road , to be the traffic themselves .

Gun Shaped Egg Fryer
When I was a kid , in order to get me to eat eggs , my mom used to soft boil my eggs , then cut toast up into strips and told me the cut up bread were soldiers .
I would then dip my soldiers in the egg yolk , like the soldier was killing the egg .
As a kid , I thought the whole egg soldier idea was great , but if they had these when I was a kid , my mom could have saved herself a lot of creative energy and let the shape of my eggs sell them selves .
Feast your eyes on these amazing egg frying molds .
The molds allow you to fry your eggs in the shape of different kinds of fire arms .
The funny thing is , if I got any of these molds as a present , I would probably be inclined to eat more eggs .
Even in my late twenties the simplest novelties still entertain the hell out of me .
The pride takes a water break at Kalahari Gemsbok National Park , South Africa J. Sneesby / B. Wilkins / Stone / Getty Images
There are only about 26,000 lions on the planet , and most of them live in Africa , south of the Sahara desert [ source : National Geographic ] .
As with many species , the male lion is typically larger than its female counterpart .
While a lioness is usually about 5 feet ( 1.5 meters ) long and around 400 pounds ( 181.4 kilograms ) , males can be as long as 8 feet ( 2.4 meters ) and tip the scales at 550 pounds ( 249.5 kilograms ) .
The world 's most social cats , lions live in groups called prides .
Between three and 30 lions make a pride , which is comprised almost entirely of related females .
This tightly knit group of lionesses will stick together for life -- it 's quite difficult for an unrelated lone female to be accepted by the group .

The males , on the other hand , generally move on after reaching adulthood -- nature 's way of stirring the genetic pot .
A pride may have up to two unrelated adult male lions , and these males are under near - constant assault from other males trying to move in on their territory .
A male may hold its top spot in the pride for several years , but eventually he will be killed or run off by a younger or stronger outsider .
If he is n't killed in the process , the usurped male must leave and become a loner , doing his best to survive alone or looking for another pride with a male he can conquer .
It 's good to be king , however .
Lionesses do more than 90 percent of the hunting , while the male shows up after the kill , demanding and receiving first dibs on the meat .
While the lionesses hunt , the males stay back to defend the territory , protect the cubs and keep watch for overly ambitious lone males who know a good situation when they see it .
Lionesses are lighter , faster and more agile than males , and these traits make them deadly hunters .
These killers hunt in packs to limit injury , often between dusk and dawn .

The African buffalo hunts little more than grass , but you would n't want to bump into one in a dark alley .
At 6 feet ( 1.83 meters ) tall and 1,500 pounds ( 680.4 kilograms ) , this abundant and unpredictable creature is in no mood for monkey business ( or lion or leopard business ) .
Strong , powerful and wielding a set of horns that can measure 4 feet ( 1.22 meters ) from tip to tip , the African buffalo is n't the kind of creature you want to startle .
Many people consider them more dangerous than lions , and for good reason -- on average , more people are killed by African buffalo every year than by these big cats [ source : National Geographic ] .
What they lack in speed , they make up for in stamina , and , like the lion , African buffalo are quite sociable with their own kind , often traveling in herds that range from 350 up to several thousand buffalo .
As in prides , these herds consist overwhelmingly of females , and males use their giant horns to jostle for dominance .
Male calves , which can walk at birth but are dependent on their mothers in the first year of life , must leave the herd once fully grown .
Dominant male buffalo , which physically peak at about 10 years of age , must also leave once they 've been conquered and replaced [ source : AWF ] .
These solo males , once the defenders of the entire herd , are now easy prey for lions in need of a big meal .
So how does the herd protect itself when a well - organized assassination squad of lionesses is on the prowl ?

My mouse does n’t really do anything more than a standard mouse is supposed to do .
Sure , it ’s got a couple of extra buttons that come in handy when playing games , or just navigating the web , however , it ’s all very basic mouse - like stuff .
I ’m quite happy with my mouse , as I can think of very few other functions I would like for it to serve .
However , it seems that there is a growing need for mice that also happen to be scales .
I ca n’t imagine what the average person would do with such a scale at their computer , unless maybe they do a lot of shipping , and their items are rather small .
I also suppose that if you ’re selling drugs , it might be quite useful to have a small , easily - hidden scale at your desk .
Whatever it is you happen to need it for , the MSC - 500 Mouse Scale can measure in 0.1g , 0.005 oz. , 0.005ozt. , and 0.1 dwt increments .
If this sort of thing is up your alley , it ’ll set you back a salty $ 60 .
