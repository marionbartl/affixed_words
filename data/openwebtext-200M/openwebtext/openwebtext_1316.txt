Binion ’s to close all 365 rooms , lay off 100 workers

Sun coverage Headlines from the Vegas gaming industry
Binion 's Gambling Hall & Hotel in downtown Las Vegas will close its 365 rooms on Dec. 14 and lay off about 100 workers .
Spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said the decision was made as a result of the economic downturn , which has decreased occupancy at the property and other hotels across the Las Vegas Valley .
Robinson said Binion 's also will close the Binion 's Original Coffee Shop and discontinue keno .
The casino , sports book , poker room and Binion 's Ranch Steakhouse on the property 's 24th floor will stay open .
Robinson said the decision was made Friday .
She said Binion 's has n't determined when the rooms might reopen .
" We have been actively analyzing every aspect of our operation and looking at our costs , especially those that were significant cost drains , " Robinson said .
" The hotel rooms simply could not remain competitive in this market .
We had to make some necessary , but unfortunate , decisions in order to keep the remaining parts of the property operational . "
Binion 's currently employs about 800 workers .
That number will be reduced to about 700 workers after the layoffs associated with the room closures .
Of the 365 rooms that are closing , 266 are in the Binion 's tower while 99 rooms are in the original portion of the property .
Robinson said Dec. 14 was chosen as the closing date because it's a traditionally slower time after the Nationals Finals Rodeo , which ends Dec. 12 .
Guests with reservations at Binion 's will be accommodated at the Four Queens Hotel & Casino .
At a Monday afternoon press conference , Mayor Oscar Goodman said that for the past 10 days he ’s been working with the owners of Binions and the Four Queens to try to positively resolve the situation .
Goodman said he left the latest meeting at 10:45 a.m.
Monday – under the impression that closing the hotel could be averted .
Soon thereafter , he said he got a call with the bad news .
Despite the hotel ’s closure – and the fact that it might be difficult to find investors with “ fresh money ” willing to fund the rooms ’ refurbishment – the mayor said that “ we still have that glimmer of hope , with the casino remaining open and the restaurants remaining open . ”
“ Whenever you have a setback , that ’s not a positive thing .
But I ’ve always tried to make lemonade out of lemons , ” Goodman said .
Developers such as Cordish Co. and Forest City Enterprises , each with their own proposed downtown development projects that include new casinos / hotels , are still very much interested and on board , he said .
“ They ’re looking forward , ” Goodman said .
“ They ’re smart people . ”
In September , the Las Vegas Valley saw its first year - over - year increase in visitation since May 2008 , with the count up 4.3 percent , to 3 million people , from September 2008 .
But in order to fill rooms , Las Vegas hotels have lowered rates , which on average were $ 91 in September compared to $ 112 in September 2008 .

German Justice Minister Criticizes Google ' I See a Giant Monopoly Developing That 's Reminiscent of Microsoft '
In a SPIEGEL interview , German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger discusses her concerns about the threat of a global Google monopoly and the debate over the use of full - body scanners at airports following the recent terror attempt near Detroit .
By Karishma Vaswani
BBC News , Jakarta
Dr Gina Puspita tries to help women get over their jealousy
It is a scene of peaceful serenity .
Rows of men kneel in deep prayer inside a large hall on the outskirts of Jakarta .
The women sit just behind them , their heads bowed in quiet contemplation .
It could be afternoon prayers anywhere in Indonesia , a vast Muslim - majority archipelago , but this scene happens to be inside the sprawling headquarters of Jakarta 's newest club - the " Global Ikhlwan " polygamy club .
Tucked away in a leafy suburb a few hours out of Jakarta , the club was set up in Indonesia earlier this year , but has its origins in Malaysia .
It says it has more than 1,000 members worldwide - as far away as Australia and the United States .
In Indonesia , the law allows men to marry more than one woman - but only under strict conditions , which makes the practice of polygamy less common here than in other Muslim nations .
But that could change if the controversial new polygamy club is a success .
Peaceful environment
The club has garnered a great deal of criticism since its inception .
Children are taught Islamic scripture at the polygamy club
But in the hall , the only sounds you can hear that disrupt the quiet are the voices of young children filling the corridors .
They are being taught to read Islamic scriptures , so that they can become pious Muslims from a young age .
There is also a small shop that sells Islamic and Halal food - even a production house which makes Islamic films .
But the main aim of the club is to promote the virtues of polygamy , as well as to support those who are struggling with their choices .
In one of the club 's rooms , the director of the organisation , Dr Gina Puspita , speaks to a group of young women trying to help them get over their jealousies and insecurities .
She admits she found it hard when her husband Rizdam took on a second wife .
" It was difficult for me in the beginning , but I knew it was because of my emotions , my desires , " she told me .
" But polygamy is a way for us to find happiness and love in this world .
" There are a lot of advantages for women in polygamous marriages - we learn how to control our desires and jealousies , and this brings us closer to Allah . "
Tight controls But Dr Puspita 's stance on polygamy is firmly opposed by some groups in Indonesia .
This country has strict rules about who is allowed to take on multiple wives .
Nursyahbani Katjasungkana is firmly against polygamy
The guiding principle of Indonesia 's marriage law is monogamy .
Polygamy is tolerated - but tightly controlled .
You have to go through a number of steps to take more than one wife .
First , you have to get your first wife 's permission .
Second , if she does not give you her consent , you must prove that she is either infertile , terminally ill , or not performing her wifely duties .
And finally you have to get the permission of a religious adviser .
Although there are no official statistics for how many people in Indonesia are polygamous - because so many of the marriages go unregistered - women 's groups say organisations like the polygamy club could prompt more Indonesian men to take on multiple wives .
Activist Nursyahbani Katjasungkana is incensed by the polygamy club , and she uses the Koran to try to refute claims that polygamy is an acceptable , even desirable Islamic practice .
" When the scripture revealed to the Prophet Muhammad its direction on polygamy , it was during the time of war , " she says .
" I believe it was a direction to the Muslims of that time that all the victims of war or widows and children who lost a father or a husband have to be protected .
That 's the message of the scriptures - it was n't really a command to men to have a second or third or fourth wife . "
But that is not an interpretation Dr Gina Puspita or her family accepts .
Back at her house , she 's frying up some rice and chicken for her family for lunch .
She cooks while Salwa , wife number three , chops up the vegetables .
It is a picture of domestic harmony , an unusual family tableau .
Her husband Rizdam tells me this system works for them .
" I think polygamy is better than monogamy , " he says to me as we share the lunch his wives have cooked for us .
" There are so many advantages - for men , it teaches us leadership .
If it difficult to manage one wife in a marriage - but four ?
It is much more difficult and it is a good educational practice . "
Sign of the times Indonesian women 's groups are calling on officials to shut the club down .
But so far the Indonesian government has said it will only monitor the club 's activities - it wo n't curtail it .
Indonesia prides itself on its reputation as a tolerant Islamic nation , but many of its people are pitted against each other in an ongoing ideological battle .
The current controversy over Indonesia 's polygamy club is a sign of the struggle this country is going through - how to be Muslim and modern at the same time .

Lying for the Lord
The following was written by Ken Clark for MormonThink .
Ken worked full time for the LDS Church Education System ( CES ) for 27 years .
He also served as a bishop ; a calling he enjoyed as much as full time instructor and Coordinator for the Church Education System .
He loved ( and still loves ) the students and the ward members .
His story can be found here .
This article is also available as a nicely formatted PDF file - provided by jiminycricket of RfM .
Ken gave an excellent presentation on Lying for the Lord at the 2008 ExMormon Foundation Conference in Salt Lake City .
Lying for the Lord on You Tube .
The right to lie in the service of your own interests is highly valued and frequently exercised .
- Nero Wolfe
Preface
I began this list when I was a full time employee of the LDS Church Education System ( CES ) .
I worked as a Seminary Principal / teacher , Institute teacher / Director , and Stake CES Coordinator from 1975 - 2002 .
My last assignment was brief .
I signed a Letter of Agreement with CES to serve as the Director of the Pullman , Washington LDS Institute of Religion adjacent to Washington State University in July 2002 .
I resigned from CES a month later .
I carry fond memories of the students , ward leaders and others I grew to respect in the LDS Church .
I started this list in an effort to defend the church from its detractors .
As an informal defender , I discovered that those accusing the church leaders of being dishonest sometimes had the facts on their side ( when I took the time to check ) .
I guessed there may have been occasional isolated examples of premeditated deception but it was not a pattern or standard practice .
My belief was that those who accused church leaders with deception were deceivers themselves .
But as I read more church history my list leaders ' prevarications grew , and at some point it occurred to me that Joseph Smith established a pattern of institutionalized deception .
Evidence presented in this list establishes that when the church or its leaders needed protection , it was , and is , okay to fib , deceive , distort , inflate , minimize , exaggerate , prevaricate or lie .
You will read quotations by church leaders who admitted that deception is a useful tool to protect the church and its leaders " when they are in a tight spot , " or " to beat the devil at his own game . "
They admit engaging in moral gymnastics ; that God approves of deception ?
if it 's done to protect the " Lord 's Church " or " the brethren . "
D. Michael Quinn called the use of deception by LDS church leaders , " theocratic ethics . "
( The Mormon Hierarchy : Origins of Power , p. 112 ) Dan Vogel in his excellent work , Joseph Smith : The Making of a Prophet , described Smith as a pious deceiver .
Smith used deception if in his mind ; it resulted in a good outcome .
Smith believed he knew when God approved of lying .
For example , Smith wrote that God commanded the prophet Abraham to lie to protect himself and his wife Sarah from harm ( Abraham 2:23 - 25 ) .
Smith believed God also approved of murder if it was for a good cause .
He wrote in the Book of Mormon that Nephi was inspired by God ( 1 Nephi 4:6 ) to deceive and murder his uncle to obtain an Israelite history .
In Missouri , Smith and his counselor Sidney Rigdon , threatened to kill Mormons who disagreed with Smith 's commands ( Quinn , The Mormon Hierarchy : Origins of Power , Chapter 3 , " Theocratic Beginnings , " pp. 79-103 ) .
Deception came naturally to Smith .
Before assuming his role as prophet , he operated confidence schemes .
He guaranteed clients that he could see underground treasure using a magic stone in the bottom of his hat .
Gullible " clients " paid him to locate treasures using this vision - in - the - hat method .
( He never found anything . )
Smith 's arrest , trial and conviction in Bainbridge , NY for fraud in 1826 documented his activity .
He was found guilty of glass looking .
The modern term for Smith would be a con artist .
( Dan Vogel , Joseph Smith : The Making of a Prophet , pp. 82-86 ) .
Excellent historical works record Smith 's deception and the deception of other LDS leaders .
A list of authors and their work , who are nevertheless charitable to Smith are :

List of Prevarications by Church Leaders ( nos. 1 - 22 )
Below is a list of notable prevarications by church leaders .
Some rate higher on the " deceit - scale " than others .
The list is not exhaustive , and offers only a sample of some of the best known incidents of deception .
Each of the incidents is referenced with the secondary source .
It 's easier for the normal reader to locate information in this way .
The footnotes provided in the secondary sources will provide you with the references for primary sources if you wish to review them .
1 . The official version of the First Vision by Joseph Smith , fashioned in 1838 , nearly 20 years after the event , was unknown to church members until published in 1842 .
It evolved after years of creative editing .
It describes a more spectacular and miraculous event than earlier versions of the same event .
The 1832 account is the original handwritten version and lacks the spectacular claims .
The early version does not mention God the Father as one who appeared to Smith , or the religious excitement that motivated Smith to pray , persecution by unbelievers , being attacked by the devil , being told not to join any apostate Christian Churches by Jesus ; and he was not called to restore a church and serve as its Prophet in the earliest version .
The 1832 " vision " resembles a common Christian epiphany where he imagined Jesus forgiving his sins .
Church leaders suppressed the contradictory and less impressive version for over a century .
( James B. Allen , Dialogue : A Journal of Mormon Thought , Autumn 1966 , pp. 29 - 45 .
See also Fawn Brodie , No Man Knows My History , pp. 24 -25 ; and The Changing World of Mormonism , pp. 148-166 ) .
2 . The LDS church consistently describes in sermons and paintings , the visitation of an angel named Moroni ( pronounced More - oh - nye ) to Joseph Smith on September 21 , 1823 .
Moroni is pictured floating above Joseph or next to his bed , alone in his bedroom .
The pictures do not accurately portray Joseph 's five brothers that slept in the same room with him .
A restored Smith house is used for LDS tours showing the small room and only two beds for six brothers .
Nothing resembling the actual sleeping arrangement is hinted at in the church 's official literature and pictorial recreations of the scene .
It would seem inconceivable to most investigators ( and perhaps many members ) that Joseph 's brothers sleeping in the same room and bed would not have been awakened by the events as described by Joseph .
The inaccurate depictions and lesson manuals are an attempt to make the event seem more believable .
Moroni .
3 . The LDS Church permits members and others to believe that the History of the Church was written by Joseph Smith .
Smith dictated the history of the church to a scribe but was killed before completing the project .
The Joseph Smith History was completed in August 1856 by historians who wrote it as if it was written by Joseph .
Brigham
Young required the historians to write it that way .
Sixty percent of the history was written after his death .
The church consciously led members believe that the official history was written by Joseph Smith .
( Brigham Young University Studies , Summer 1971 , pp. 466 , 469 , 470 , 472 )
In the middle of the 20th century after the deception was pointed out by critics , the church admitted it .
4 . When something in the official History of the Church proved embarrassing , such as the Kinderhook Plates hoax , where Joseph was tricked by pranksters who created fake metal plates that Joseph claimed were authentic , ancient Egyptian plates ; the practice was / is for LDS apologists to claim that a scribe or someone else must have written the embarrassing section instead of Joseph Smith himself .
They claim therefore that the embarrassing episode cannot be trusted .
This contradicts their claims that Smith 's revelations are authentic , though written by scribes .
( Jerald and Sandra Tanner , Shadow or Reality ?
Chapter 7 , " Changes in the Joseph Smith History , " pp. 126-142 )
5 . The famous Rocky Mountain Prophecy ( the prediction that Salt Lake would be the place the saints would settle after leaving Nauvoo , Illinois ) was a later addition to the official church history and not predicted by Joseph Smith .
Despite the fact it is not true ; the church presented it as such for more than a century .
The ' Rocky Mountain Prophecy ' was added after the Mormons arrived in Utah .
( The Changing World of Mormonism , p. 406 )
6 . A fundamental change is the name of the angel who , it was claimed , appeared in vision in Joseph Smith 's bedroom .
In the history as it was first published by Joseph Smith , we learn that the angel 's name was Nephi : " He called me by name and said … that his name was Nephi " ( Times and Seasons , vol. 3 , p. 753 ) .
In modern printings of the History of the Church , the name was changed to " Moroni " ( History of the Church , vol. 1 , p. 11 ) .
" The original handwritten manuscript shows that the name was originally written as " Nephi , " but that someone at a later date wrote the word " Moroni " above the line ( see photograph in Mormonism - Shadow or Reality ? p. 136 ) .
The book Falsification of Joseph Smith 's History , page 13 , authors demonstrated that this change was made after Joseph Smith 's death .
An examination of the duplicate copy of the handwritten manuscript , Book A - 2 , provides additional evidence that the change was not made during Joseph Smith 's lifetime .
This manuscript was not begun until about a year after Smith 's death .
Like the other manuscript ( Book A - 1 ) , it has the name " Nephi " with the name " Moroni " interpolated above the line .
" It is interesting to note that Joseph Smith lived for two years after the name " Nephi " was printed in the church 's official publication Times and Seasons , and never published a retraction or correction .
In August , 1842 , the Millennial Star , published by the church in England , also printed Joseph Smith 's story stating that the angel 's name was " Nephi " ( see Millennial Star , vol. 3 , p. 53 ) .
On page 71 of the same volume it reads that the message of the angel Nephi…opened a new dispensation to man … "
" The name was also published in the 1851 edition of the Pearl of Great Price as " Nephi . "
Walter L. Whipple , in his thesis written at BYU , stated that Orson Pratt " published The Pearl of Great Price in 1878 , and removed the name of Nephi from the text entirely and inserted the name Moroni in its place ( reprinted in The Changing World of Mormonism , Chapter 13 , pp. 409-410 ) . "
7. Official Mormon histories have omitted references to Joseph Smith 's drinking and use of tobacco to create a more favorable impression of their prophet , who if living today ( 2007 ) would be unable to pass a worthiness interview and earn a temple recommend in the church he founded .
( Changing World of Mormonism , pp. 413-414 and Chapter 18 of the same online book )
" Joseph tested the Saints to make sure their testimonies were of his religion and not of him as a personable leader .
Amasa Lyman , of the First presidency , related , ' Joseph Smith tried the faith of the Saints many times by his peculiarities .
At one time , he had preached a powerful sermon on the Word of Wisdom , and immediately thereafter , he rode through the streets of Nauvoo smoking a cigar .
Some of the brethren were tried as was Abraham of old . ' "
( " Joseph Smith as an Administrator , " Master 's Thesis , Brigham Young University , May 1969 , p. 161 .
Quotation found in The Changing World of Mormonism , p. 31 )
8. Leonard Arrington , the official LDS Church Historian for nearly a decade ( 1972 - 1982 ) lamented the suppression of truthful Mormon history in favor of a faith promoting version .
Six years previous to his appointment as church historian , Dr. Arrington wrote : " It is unfortunate for the cause of Mormon history that the Church Historian 's Library , which is in the possession of virtually all of the diaries of leading Mormons , has not seen fit to publish these diaries or to permit qualified historians to use them without restriction . "
( Dialogue : A Journal of Mormon Thought , Spring 1966 , p. 26 ) Leonard Arrington was demoted in 1982 transferred from the church historians office to BYU because of his refreshing honesty ; he was a threat to the faith promoting history the church insisted he support ( Deseret News , Church Section , July 5 , 1980 ; Link to content . ) .
The church does not report accurate unflattering historical facts about its origins and leaders to the membership or the world , unless forced to by published disclosures of deception .
9. Joseph Smith claimed that God revealed truth directly to him .
He declared that God , Jesus and angels appeared in person .
Sometimes they spoke in an audible voice , and sometimes they spoke in a quiet voice or feeling in his mind and heart ?
D&C 8:2 ; 9:7-9 .
He made arrangements to publish a collection of revealed truths in the Book of Commandments but offended Missourians who destroyed the printing press in 1833 before the venture was completed .
A few copies were saved .
Two years later he published another version with original revelations revised and more revelations added and called it the Doctrine and Covenants .
Apologists claim that added material was only to make the revelation seem clearer to the reader .
( Melvin J. Petersen " A Study of the Nature of and Significance of the Changes in the Revelations as Found in a Comparison of the Book of Commandments and Subsequent Editions of the Doctrine and Covenants , " Master 's thesis , BYU , 1955 , typed copy , p. 147 )
Those close to Joseph and the process of revising the " revelations " make a different claim .
David Whitmer , a close associate of Smith's , was perhaps the most vocal opponent to the revisions ; many that contradicted earlier revelations .
He considered the original revelations to be God-inspired .
He questioned the revised revelations which coincidentally granted all power and authority to Smith .
( Letter written by David Whitmer , published in the Saints ' Herald , February 5 , 1887 ) Current LDS members are unaware of the significant revisions .
They do not know that the meaning of some of the " revelations " was reversed .
David Whitmer and others raise the question of whether Joseph Smith received revelations from God or whether they originated in his own mind .
If Mormons continue to insist that JS was inspired by God , critics might ask , " Which God ? ?
the one who revealed the first revelations , or the one who revealed the later ones that contradicted the first ? "
( David Whitmer , see An Address to All Believers in Christ .
Also The Changing World of Mormonism , online book , Chapter 3 , Link to content . )
10 . Joseph made a career of retrofitting earlier revelations to make it appear as if church doctrines and practices were revealed by God incrementally , logically and sequentially , as described by the official history of the LDS church .
He and apologists refer to this process of revising God 's written word as continuing revelation .
Others call it theological innovation , revelations of convenience , or creative imagination .
Smith also made contradictory revisions to the original doctrines in the Book of Mormon , as his theological views evolved .
( 1 Nephi 3 pp. 25 , 26 , 32 in the 1830 [ original ] version .
Compare changes to current Book of Mormon version in 1 Nephi 11 : 18 , 21 , 23 , 40 )
11 . Joseph Smith created the Mormon Priesthood after organizing the church , but official church lesson materials do not include these troubling facts .
His priesthood innovations were an extension of the practice of revising revelations to match his evolving theological ideas .
LaMar Petersen explained , " The important details that are missing from the " full history " [ of priesthood restoration ] of 1834 are likewise missing from the Book of Commandments in 1833 .
The student would expect to find all the particulars of the Restoration in this first treasured set of 65 revelations , the dates of which encompassed the bestowals of the two Priesthoods , but they are conspicuously absent … .
The notable revelations on Priesthood in the Doctrine and Covenants , Sections 2 and 13 , are missing , and Chapter 28 gives no hint of the Restoration which , if actual , had been known for four years . "
" More than four hundred words were added to this revelation [ on priesthood ] of August 1829 ( Section 27 of the Doctrine and Covenants ) .
The new material added the names of heavenly visitors and two separate ordinations .
The Book of Commandments listed the duties of Elders , Priests , Teachers , and Deacons and refers to Joseph 's apostolic calling but there is no mention of Melchizedek Priesthood , High Priesthood , Seventies , High Priests , or High Councilors .
These words were later inserted into the revelation on Church organization and government of April , 1830 , making it appear that they were known at that date .
But they do not appear in the original , Chapter 24 of the Book of Commandments three years later .
Similar interpolations were made in the revelations known as Sections 42 and 68 . "
( Problems in Mormon Text , by LaMar Petersen , pp. 7 - 8 .

D. Michael Quinn , Mormon Hierarchy : Origins of Power , Chapter 1 , " The Evolution of Authority . "
The Changing Story of Mormonism , Chapter 16 )
12 . Mormons ' official publications remove critical references to Joseph Smith 's activities as a con man .
Documents discovered in 1971 by Dr. Wesley Walters in Norwich , New York , verify that Joseph Smith was a " glass looker " and that he was arrested , tried and found guilty by a justice of the peace in Bainbridge , New York , in 1826 for this criminal activity .
LDS historian Dr. Francis W. Kirkham , refused to believe that Smith was a disreputable con man , who bilked people out of money with promises to find buried treasure through the use of a peep stone in a hat .
He wrote , " If such a court record confession could be identified and proved , then it follows that his believers must deny his claimed divine guidance which led them to follow him … .
How could he be a prophet of God , the leader of the Restored Church to these tens of thousands , if he had been the superstitious fraud which ' the pages from a book ' declared he confessed to be ? "
( A New Witness for Christ in America , vol. 1 , pp. 385-87 and pp. 486-87 ; and The Changing World of Mormonism , Chapter 4 , " Joseph Smith and Money Digging . "
See also Shadow or Reality ? pp. 35 -36 ) .
Hugh Nibley , famous dissembling LDS apologist also stated , " … if this court record is authentic it is the most damning evidence in existence against Joseph Smith . "
Dr. Nibley 's book also states that if the authenticity of the court record could be established it would be " the most devastating blow to Smith ever delivered . "
( Hugh Nibley , The Mythmakers p. 142 .
See also The Changing World of Mormonism , Chapter 4 , " Joseph Smith and Money Digging . " )
In the 1826 court record Joseph Smith confessed that " for three years " prior to 1826 he had used a magic stone placed in his hat to find treasures or lost property .
Mormon histories insist that a heavenly messenger revealed the presence of gold plates on September 21 , 1823 to an innocent Joseph Smith , at the same time he was actually conning overly optimistic treasure seekers out of their money .
Smith also swore that gold plates were buried in a hill near his Palmyra , New York home .
He continued these deceptive practices for at least three of the four years after God was supposedly preparing him to receive the gold plates .
According to apologists Kirkham and Nibley , these facts completely undermine the credibility of Mormonism 's first prophet and founder .
( Dan Vogel , Joseph Smith : The Making of a Prophet , Signature Books , 2004 , pp. 80 - 86 )
13 . Official church histories refuse to supply the details of Smith 's deception or the court records convicting him of glass looking .
Church leaders insist that " some [ historical ] truths are not very useful " and they aggressively prevent attempts to publish a full and truthful history of Mormonism 's actual origins .
( Boyd K. Packer , " The Mantle is Far , Far Greater Than the Intellect , " 1981 , BYU Studies , Vol. 21 , No. 3 , pp. 259-271 )
14 . LDS Historians are threatened and sometimes excommunicated if they publish an objective history rather than a faith promoting version ( if they are employed for the church ) .
Packer cited above , referred to objective histories of Mormonism as " disease germs . "
Most ethical historians regard deliberately inaccurate histories to be disease germs instead .
( Ostling , Richard and Joan , Mormon America , pp. 351-370 .
One Nation Under Gods , Richard Abanes , pp. 417-419 . )

15 . Joseph Smith claimed that he discovered gold plates with strange engravings , and special spectacles called " Interpreters . "
The LDS Church teaches members and investigators that he found a Urim and Thummim used to translate the golden plates .
( Link to content . )
This claim is not true .
In an 1885 interview , Zenas H. Gurley , the editor of the RLDS Saints ' Herald , asked David Whitmer if Joseph Smith had used his peep stone to translate the plates .
Whitmer , who offered his home to Smith and acted as a scribe for part of the translation of the Book of Mormon , replied that Smith gave the Interpreters back to an angel and used a peep stone or " Seers Stone " to translate the Book of Mormon ; one that he had found while digging a well .
It was an ordinary rock but Smith claimed it gave him the ability to see buried treasure .
( The Changing World of Mormonism , pp. 80 - 83 )
Martin Harris , who also acted as a scribe , lost the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon translation .
He confirmed that Smith testified that the angel Moroni took back both the plates and the Interpreters .
He claimed that the angel later returned the gold plates , but not the Interpreters .
Harris confirmed that Smith stared at a rock placed in a hat to produce the present - day Book of Mormon .
( Link to content . )
( To see actual photographs of Smith 's favorite rocks , see pp. 324-325 of D. Michael Quinn , Early Mormonism and the Magic World View , revised and enlarged , Signature Books , SLC , 1998 )
16 . William W. Phelps first suggested in 1833 that perhaps the seer stones were the Urim and Thummim of the Old Testament ( The Evening and Morning Star , Jan. 1833 ) .
This lent more credibility to Smith 's story .
Historians for the church rewrote the historical accounts to make it appear that from the beginning the Interpreters or Smith 's peep stone was referred to as the Urim and Thummim .
This is more tasteful in the minds of some than referring to the instruments used to translate the Book of Mormon as " the peep stone Joseph found while digging a well . "
( The Changing World of Mormonism , pp. 80 - 83 .
See also comment by B.H. Roberts in Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , vol. 1 , p. 129 )
17 . Official Mormon histories are not forthcoming about the statements by the three and eight witnesses respectively , who claim to have seen Smith 's gold plates and handled them .
The faith promoting histories do not inform investigators or members that their experience was one that took place in their imaginations or as they called it , " spiritual eyes , " " eyes of our understanding , " " a supernatural vision , " or " visions of the mind . "
Martin Harris ( one of the 3 witnesses ) testified publicly on March 25 , 1838 that " none of the signatories to the Book of Mormon saw or handled the actual physical plates . "
He also indicated that Joseph prepared an affidavit beforehand and asked the witnesses to sign it .
But because they had not seen a physical object , only a vision of them , some balked .
They were finally persuaded by Joseph to sign .
David Whitmer also told Zenas Gurley Jr. on January 14 , 1885 when asked if the witnesses actually touched " the real metal , " " We did not . "
The witnesses handled " the plates " in a vision only , according to Whitmer .
Such is the power of imagination .
( Grant Palmer , An Insider 's View of Mormon Origins , Chapter 6 ) There are other significant problems with the story of the 3 and 8 witnesses described by Palmer , for those interested in reading more .
18 .
The eight witnesses did not all imagine seeing the plates or angel at the same time as the church leads people to believe .
The plates were imagined in two groups of four , not all 8 together as popularized in church paintings .
( Deseret Evening News , 6 Aug. 1878 , Letter to the editor from P. Wilhelm Poulson , M.D. , typed transcript , p. 2 ) Only David Whitmer and perhaps Oliver Cowdery imagined the angel together .
Martin Harris removed himself from the group and did not imagine seeing the angel until some three days later .
( Grant Palmer , An Insider 's View of Mormon Origins , Chapter 6 .
Anthony Metcalf , Ten Years Before the Mast , n.d. , microfilm copy , pp. 70 - 71 ) Link to content .
19 .
The LDS Church misrepresents the method by which Joseph Smith authored the Book of Mormon .
Quite unlike the explanations and images offered to members in official church publications , Joseph Smith never had gold plates in view when " translating , " nor did he use an Old Testament instrument called the Urim and Thummim .
( The Changing World of Mormonism , pp. 84-85 )
20 . Smith's " translation " method was the same he used to con people into believing he could locate subterranean treasure .
He put his favorite magic rock in a hat , pulled the hat over his face , and rested his elbows on his knees , to read the English words and sentences that God placed on the stone , according to Smith 's faithful scribes .
These faithful scribes said the imaginary plates were never in view , in the same room , or often never in the house , when Smith was " translating . "
( Emma Smith , The Saints ' Herald , May 19 , 1888 , p. 310 ; and Saints ' Herald , November 15 , 1962 , p. 16 .
Martin Harris , Historical Record , by Andrew Jensen , p. 216 .
David Whitmer , An Address To All Believers In Christ , p. 12 .
Grant Palmer , An Insider 's View of Mormon Origins )
21 . This may explain why nothing ancient appears in a book that is supposed to be of ancient origin .
It may also explain why large sections of faulty King James text are plentiful , and why virtually nothing Smith described about the life of ancient inhabitants of America is correct .
Despite Apostle Russell M. Nelson 's talk to a small , select group admitting that Joseph used the stone - in - the - hat method to translate the Book of Mormon , he failed to give sufficient salient details such as the fact that the plates were often never in the same room as Smith ; and he never consulted the plates during his supposed translation .
This begs the question which the church avoids :
Why all the fuss about a set of golden plates and magic peep stones ?
including the threat of death to anyone who saw the plates without permission ?
if they were not in view and he did not use them as a reference ?
( Russell M. Nelson , " Adapted from an address given 25 June 1992 at a seminar for new mission presidents , Missionary Training Center , Provo , Utah , " can be found at Link to content . )
22 . The church suppressed damaging information that a general authority , considered to be the church 's foremost expert on the Book of Mormon , admitted that Joseph Smith had the resources , imagination and ability to author the Book of Mormon .
Brigham H. Roberts ( 1857 -1933 ) , an LDS General Authority ( Council of Seventy ) doubted that the Book of Mormon is a translation of ancient scripture , after researching troubling questions .
Elder Roberts uncovered extensive evidence that Joseph Smith borrowed the basic plot and many details from other books .
This evidence - long suppressed because it is considered harmful to the Mormon Church - is presented in detail in three essays by Roberts , now published as Studies of the Book of Mormon ( Salt Lake City : Signature Books , 1992 ) .
Some observations from B.H. Roberts ' work :
It has been pointed out in these pages that there are many things in the former book [ Ethan Smith 's View of the Hebrews ] that might well have suggested many major things in the other .
Not a few things merely , one or two , or half dozen , but many ; and it is this fact of many things of similarity and the cumulative force of them that makes them so serious a menace to Joseph Smith 's story of the Book of Mormon 's origin…
The material in Ethan Smith 's book is of a character and quantity to make a ground plan for the Book of Mormon ( Studies , p. 240 ) .
… was Joseph Smith possessed of a sufficiently vivid and creative imagination as to produce such a work as the Book of Mormon from such materials as have been indicated in the preceding chapters …?
That such power of imagination would have to be of a high order is conceded ; that Joseph Smith possessed such a gift of mind there can be no question ( Studies , p. 243 ) .
[ Roberts quoted J. Smith 's mother 's history of Joseph . ]
During our evening conversations , Joseph would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined .
He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent , their dress , mode of travelings , and the animals upon which they rode ; their cities , their buildings , with every particular ; their mode of warfare ; and also their religious worship .
This he would do with as much ease , seemingly , as if he had spent his whole life among them ( Studies , p. 243 ) .
[ Joseph Smith recited the scenes well before his claim that gold plates existed with the same " history " of America . ]
[ Roberts concluded ]
These evening recitals could come from no other source than the vivid , constructive imagination of Joseph Smith , a remarkable power which attended him through all his life .
It was as strong and varied as Shakespeare 's and no more to be accounted for than the English Bard 's ( Studies , p. 244 ) .
List of Deceptions to Protect the Practice of Polygamy ( nos. 23 -124 )
The next section deals primarily with purposeful deception by church leaders to protect the practice of polygamy .
The practice instigated an almost constant stream of untruths , lies , or prevarications .
It also introduced the practice of systematic character assassination .
Some apologists have excused the leaders ' dishonesty , and praised them instead for their extreme dedication to a principle they believed was revealed by God .
This kind of apologetic logic would praise those who strap bombs to their bodies or fly airplanes into skyscrapers driven by fanatical dedication to their particular religious beliefs .
23 . One of Joseph Smith 's first experiments with adultery began with a teen - age girl named Fanny Ward Alger who worked in the Smith home as a maidservant .
William E. McLellin , Mormon Apostle , indicated that Emma Smith " looked through a crack and saw the transaction " in the barn .
( Richard Van Wagoner , Mormon Polygamy : A History , 2nd edition , Signature Books , 1989 , pp. 4 - 11 )
The affair led to a severe rift between loyal follower Oliver Cowdery and Joseph .
Cowdery referred to Smith 's indulgences with Fanny Alger as " A dirty , nasty , filthy affair . "
Church leaders and loyal defenders avoid linking Smith with his adultery by calling it an authorized " plural marriage . "
Todd Compton , author of , In Sacred Loneliness : The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith , 2nd edition , notes that in February or March of 1833 , when Joseph was 27 and Fanny Alger 17 , he had sexual relations with her .
After Emma found out about Joseph 's secret love affair , she turned Fanny out of their house , where she had been working as a servant .
( In Sacred Loneliness , pp. 34 -36 )
It has been noted that calling it a marriage instead of an affair raises more disturbing questions .
Polygamous marriages were not legal in Ohio , the man who performed the ceremony had no authority to perform the illegal marriage , and Smith had not claimed any " revelations " or authority directing him to enter into polygamous marital arrangements in 1833 - 1835 .
24 . The LDS Church led by Joseph Smith , canonized monogamy as God 's marriage arrangement and then did an about - face , adopting polygamy as God 's recommended mode of marriage ( D&C 42:22 - 24 and 132 ) .
Rumors about the Fanny Alger affair and rumors of another affair with Vienna Jacques , led to the development of an " Article on Marriage " in 1835 , to convince members and non-members alike that Mormons were as Christian as others , and did not engage in abominations like polygamy .
LDS leaders presented it to the general assembly of the church on August 17 , 1835 and the Article was canonized as scripture and placed in the Doctrine and Covenants where it remained until 1876 .
It acknowledged that the church [ Joseph Smith ] had been " reproached with the crime of fornication , and polygamy " and declared that " we believe , that one man should have one wife ; and one woman but one husband … " ( Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippets Avery , Mormon Enigma : Emma Hale Smith , Prophet 's Wife , " Elect Lady , " Polygamy 's Foe , Doubleday & Co. Garden City , NY , 1984 , p. 67 ) The question arises again : Which of Joseph 's revelations was " inspired , " the one recommending monogamy or the one recommending polygamy ?
25 . Joseph Smith institutionalized the practice of lying , so church leaders could deny the practice of taking multiple wives and keep Smith out of legal trouble .
Sober - faced lies permitted leaders to deceive with a clear conscience ; believing that God permitted and even encouraged lying to protect the principle of plural marriage .
An article from the 1886 Deseret News listed the code words and the rationale for their use .
When accused of practicing " polygamy " Joseph and Hyrum denied it because it was different than " celestial " marriage " and " a plurality of wives . "
Polygamy was after all , a doctrine of men and the devil .
" Celestial marriage " was different Smith reasoned , because it was a holy doctrine revealed by God .
Joseph wanted followers to believe that the two terms were completely dissimilar .
Other code words were , " eternal marriage , " " the divine order of marriage , " " Holy order of marriage , " " living up to your privileges , " " new and everlasting covenant , " and " a different view of things . "
If accusers did not frame their allegations using precisely the right terms , the leaders felt justified in prevaricating .
If the accusers framed their words perfectly , the leaders lied anyway .
Their view was that it was more important to live the higher law ?
loyalty to the Prophet ? than to expose the truth to Gentiles .
A prominent feature of Mormonism is that loyalty trumps honesty .
( Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippets Avery , Mormon Enigma : Emma Hale Smith , p. 113 .
See also B. Carmon Hardy , Solemn Covenant : The Mormon Polygamous Passage , University of Illinois Press , 1992 , p. 365 . )

26 . Vienna Jacques of Nauvoo heard rumors about " spiritual wifery . "
She wanted Emma to ask Joseph " if the rumors were true .
Was " spiritual wifery " a doctrine of the church ? "
Emma asked and relayed Joseph 's answer .
Vienna reported , " he , [ Joseph ] had told her [ Emma ] to tell the sisters of the [ Women 's Relief ] society … " the whole idea was absolutely false and the doctrine an evil and unlawful thing . "
Joseph was secretly practicing plural marriage at the time .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 114 )
27 . Contrary to the traditional LDS claim that the first wife had to first give her consent in order for her husband to take another wife , Emma Smith was unaware of nearly all of Joseph's " marriages " to other women .
Eliza Snow , secretary to Emma in the Relief Society organization , as well as Sarah Cleveland , Emma 's counselor , who was legally married to John Cleveland , were secretly married to Joseph , and Emma knew nothing about the marriages .
According to Newell and Avery , " To live as a secret wife to a friend 's husband demanded evasion , subterfuge , and deception . "
( Mormon Enigma , p. 119 )
28 . Joseph Smith secretly married 17 year old Sarah Ann Whitney in August 1842 without Emma 's knowledge or consent .
He had no intention of confessing his conduct to Emma .
He wrote to her parents who approved of the marriage , " The only thing to be careful of is to find out when Emma comes , then you can not be safe , but when she is not here , there is the most perfect safety …
Burn this letter as soon as you read it . "
( Mormon Enigma , p. 125 )
29 . The Times and Seasons , August 1842 published an article defending Joseph .
It quoted church scripture , the Doctrine and Covenants . " …
We declare that we believe , that one man should have one wife ; and one woman , but one husband .
We know of no other rule or system of marriage . "
The purpose of the article was to deny that Joseph had taught John C. Bennett the concept of spiritual wifery , after Bennett seduced several women in Nauvoo under the guise of God-inspired polygamy .
Many of those who signed the declaration of monogamy were secretly practicing polygamy .
Joseph had taught Bennett the principle , and the signatories knew it .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 128 ) Mormons used the term spiritual wifery ( the ungodly form of plural marriage , in their minds ) as an excuse to deny the charges .
But faithful Mormons used the term themselves to describe the " right " version of polygamy before and after their exodus to Salt Lake .
( B. Carmon Hardy , Solemn Covenant : The Mormon Polygamous Passage , University of Illinois Press , 1992 , p. 365 )
30 . Joseph deceived Emma when he married two other women ( probably Martha McBride Knight and Ruth Vose Sayers ) without her knowledge or consent in the winter of 1842 - 43 .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 134 and note 13 )
31 . Joseph secretly proposed to 19 - year - old Nancy Rigdon in Nauvoo in 1842 when Smith was 36 years - old .
She declined , so Joseph recruited another LDS woman to convince Nancy .
She rejected that attempt too and insisted that she be permitted to leave the locked room .
Smith dictated a letter and tried to convince her that God revealed the practice , and a commandment to take multiple wives .
Part of his letter read like a manifesto for situational ethics that modern LDS leaders condemn : " That which is wrong under one circumstance , may be , and often is , right under another ….
Whatever God requires is right , no matter what it is , although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire . "
Nancy showed the letter to her father , Sidney Rigdon .
When Sidney questioned Joseph about it , he denied the whole affair .
Joseph admitted to it only when Sidney showed Joseph his letter .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 119 , and Van Wagoner , Mormon Polygamy , 2nd edition pp. 32-33 )
32 . Martha Brotherton , an 18 year - old convert from England , emigrated to Nauvoo , Illinois in 1842 with her parents .
Brigham Young approached Joseph Smith to ask if he could add Martha as another plural wife .
Smith agreed and called a meeting with Young and Martha .
She knew nothing of the agreement between them beforehand .
Her parents were not informed or invited , though she would be regarded as a dependent minor today .
After Smith and Young made great efforts to persuade her , Martha refused .
They encouraged her to lie to her parents and keep their proposal a secret and tried again to convince her to accept Brigham 's proposal .
Martha finally appealed to them through tears and pleading that she be given time to think about the offer .
After being sworn to secrecy and permitted to leave the room , Martha revealed everything to her parents and wrote the events while the important details were fresh in her mind .
She told others in Nauvoo about the episode before the family boarded a steamboat bound for St. Louis .
She published her account in a St. Louis newspaper ( St. Louis Bulletin , July 15 , 1842 , p. 2 ) .
Smith , stung by the article , immediately denied that the events Martha described took place .
He also issued false affidavits and statements that labeled Martha not only a liar , but also an apostate and " mean harlot . "
Smith used lies to commit character assassination when he thought the situation warranted it ; no matter how young his victim was .
( Arza Evans , The Keystone of Mormonism , Keystone Books Inc. , 2003 , St. George Utah , pp. 20 - 21 . )
33 . Joseph Smith circulated false , lurid stories designed to blacken the character of others he considered enemies .
Lies and character assassination convinced gullible members that Smith 's character was unimpeachable and rumors of his adultery were unfounded .
In an article in the church publication , Messenger and Advocate ( June 18 , 1845 ) Sidney Rigdon acknowledged that Parley P. Pratt , advised church leaders how to support Smith , and advised that " we must lie to support brother Joseph , it is our duty to do so . "
34 . Zeruiah Goddard , signed a false statement vilifying Sarah Pratt .
It was added to other slanderous and libelous statements as part of a smear campaign against Sarah ; orchestrated by Smith after she refused his advances .
Goddard confessed to Sarah years later that Hyrum Smith ( Joseph 's brother ) , " came to our house with affidavits all written out , and forced us to sign them .
Joseph and the Church must be saved , said he .
We saw that resistance was useless , they would have ruined us ; so we signed the papers . "
Church leaders felt comfortable breaking civil laws to promote polygamy , were willing to lie to protect polygamy , and willing to resort to character assassination in the form of slander and libel , against any who exposed Joseph 's secret , unjustifiable behavior .
( Richard Van Wagoner , Mormon Polygamy : A History , 2nd edition , p. 34 and Footnote 12 , p. 38 )
35 . On March 4 , 1843 Joseph deceived Emma when he secretly married 19 year - old Emily Partridge .
Emily was happy to comply and said , " Of course I would keep his secret . "
At some point , Emma weakened and gave Joseph , Emily and Eliza Partridge as plural wives .
She may have misunderstood , and believed that Joseph would never consummate the marriages .
Joseph participated in the fake ceremony , but neglected to tell Emma that he had already secretly married the two sisters some time before .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 138 )
36 . On May 1 , 1843 , Joseph deceived Emma and others when he married 17 year - old Lucy Walker while Emma was away in St. Louis .
Lucy admitted that Emma was not present and she did not consent to the marriage ; " she did not know anything about it at all . "
( Mormon Enigma , p. 139 )
37 . Without Emma 's knowledge or consent , Joseph secretly " slept " with young Emily Partridge according to her own testimony under oath .
She testified that she " roomed " with Joseph while Emma was somewhere else in the house on the night of their second marriage .
Some experts are convinced Emma did not understand that Joseph would have sexual relations with the two sisters Emma presented to him .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 144 )
38 .
For information indicating that Joseph consummated his multiple marriages , despite LDS apologists ' protests to the contrary , see Link to content .
39 . According to Benjamin F. Johnson , living in Ramus , Illinois , on May 16 , 1843 Joseph shared a room with the " daughter [ Eliza ] of the late Bishop Partridge . "
He did it without the knowledge or consent of Emma , or members of the church .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 145 ) Current members of the church refer to his kind of lie as a sin of omission .
40 . Joseph deceived Emma and the members of the church when he proposed to 14 year - old Helen Mar Kimball as a plural wife .
She agreed to marry Joseph because he told her that it " will ensure your eternal salvation and exaltation and that …of your father 's household and all of your kindred . "
She remarked , " I willingly gave myself to purchase so glorious a reward . "
She later admitted that she may have been deceived by her parents as well as Joseph .
She stated , " I would have never been sealed to Joseph , had I known it was anything more than a ceremony . "
It is mind - boggling that Joseph Smith placed the responsibility for Helen 's salvation and the salvation of her family , squarely on her young shoulders ; in order to persuade ( coerce ? ) her to submit to his bizarre proposal .
She was 14 years and 11 months old .
Modern Fundamentalist polygamists have been convicted for using identical tactics .
( Mormon Enigma , pp. 146-147 ; In Sacred Loneliness , p. 499 )
41 . Joseph Smith persuaded some women and girls to marry him by convincing them that he had been commanded by an angel with a drawn sword to take multiple wives .
" Joseph was commanded to take more wives and he waited until an angel with a drawn sword stood before him and declared that if he longer delayed fulfilling that command he would slay him . "
- Hyrum Smith , Elder Benjamin F. Johnson 's Letter to George S. Gibbs , 1903 ( link can be found at Link to content . )
One is reminded of the old line used by inept hustlers trying to pick up girls , " I work for the CIA ! "
42 . Joseph 's polygamous activities were unknown to the vast majority of the saints in Nauvoo because of his public and private prevarications .
He publicly denied that he practiced plural marriage , showing the ability to consciously mislead his devoted followers without remorse .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 147 , and Mormon Polygamy , pp. 20 - 21 )
When Joseph was confronted about being married to other wives in Nauvoo he protested , " What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery , and having seven wives , when I can only find one . "
In fact , he was sealed to dozens of women at the time .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 365 )
43 . Cyrus Walker defended Joseph in court after an arrest .
In exchange , Joseph promised to deliver " the Mormon vote " to Cyrus ( a Whig ) when he ran for Congress .
Joseph reneged on his promise by stating that Hyrum had received a revelation to vote for the opposition party ( Mr. Hoge , a Democrat ) .
Joseph testified that Hyrum had never received a false revelation , and in effect , directed the church members to vote for the candidate that Hyrum supported instead of Cyrus Walker .
Cyrus did not forget Smith 's antics .
Cyrus and others in the party ( the Whigs ) vowed to drive the Mormons out of the state .
Official versions of church history fail to reveal Joseph 's duplicity .
( Mormon Enigma , pp. 148 , 151 .
Also An Intimate Chronicle : The Journals of William Clayton , George D. Smith editor , Signature Books , 1995 , p. 114 )
44 . Joseph privately told William Clayton to keep a particular plural wife knowing that the membership would be troubled about it if they found out , since most of the saints believed Joseph 's repeated denials about polygamy .
Joseph cautioned Clayton that if " they raise trouble about it and bring you before me I will give you an awful scourging and probably cut you off from the church and then I will baptize you and set you ahead as good as ever . "
( An Intimate Chronicle , p. 122 ) Members of the church are unaware that fake church discipline and excommunication were effective methods of deception used to shape public perception , and maintain control of the flock .
45 . Official Mormon histories fail to inform readers of the competition to get as many plural wives as one could .
William Clayton , secretary to Joseph Smith wrote on August 11 , 1843 that with regard to marrying additional wives , Joseph told him , " You have a right to get all you can . "
( An Intimate Chronicle , p. 115 ) Those who accuse Smith of treating women like chattel use this incident as evidence .
Other examples exist in the speeches of Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball , made after the saints migrated to the West .
46 .
After receiving a promise from Joseph that he would stop the practice of polygamy ( a lie ) , Emma Smith publicly announced that Joseph supported only the traditional standards of Christian marriage ?
one husband and one wife ? as stated in the Doctrine & Covenants .
However , he secretly confided to some that he had no intention of keeping his promise to Emma .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 175 ) William Clayton recorded in his journal that " Joseph told me that since E[ mma ] came back from St. Louis she had resisted the P[riesthood ] in toto and he had to tell her he would relinquish all for her sake … .
He however told me he should not relinquish anything . "
( An Intimate Chronicle p. 117 ) ; Emma had apparently threatened Joseph with divorce in order to prevent the practice of plural marriage , so Joseph lied to keep her from divorcing him .
Official LDS curriculum and histories portray Joseph and Emma as a happy married couple .
47 . In August 1843 , Emma discovered that sixteen - year - old Flora Woodworth was carrying a gold watch that Joseph had given her .
Emma realized the implications and demanded that Flora give the watch back .
Smith reprimanded her , but Emma refused to be quiet in the carriage ride home .
William Clayton said that Joseph had to employ " harsh measures " to stop her complaining .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 159 )
It also raises the question of whether or not Joseph used both physical force and lies to avoid divorce .
( An Intimate Chronicle , p. 118 )
48 . The official history of the church states that the Relief Society was officially disbanded in 1844 shortly after being organized , " due to the various calamities that befell the saints . "
Those writing the official history as well as the leaders of the church knew it was actually disbanded because Emma Smith was an outspoken opponent of polygamy .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 175 ) Joseph 's public discourses and written ones ( a letter from the presidency and an article entitled , " The Voice of Innocence , " written by W. W. Phelps with Joseph's supervision ) , denied that polygamy was part of the doctrine of the Latter - day Saints .
These documents were read in Relief Society meetings in Nauvoo and recommended as the standard by which saints should conduct themselves .
Joseph needed to silence Emma and take away her forum .
She quoted his denials as evidence that polygamy was not an inspired principle and not practiced by Smith .
( Mormon Enigma , p. 175 ) Official histories refuse to tell the real story .
49 . Official Mormon histories , though aware of the marital arrangements , withheld information about Joseph 's polygamous marriages ?
namely that nearly a dozen of his first polygamous wives were legally married to other men at the time of their marriage to Joseph ( polyandry ) .
They have never admitted that Joseph practiced polyandry .
( Todd Compton , In Sacred Loneliness : The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith , Signature Books , 1997 Introduction .
See also Link to content . )
Church instructional manuals often portray early church leaders as monogamists , and refuse to disclose their penchant for deception .
50 . Official Mormon histories deceive readers by failing to point out that Joseph exercised poor judgment , to say it most kindly , in choosing his friends and other church leaders .
William Clayton 's journal entry for May 16 , 1843 records the following : " President J[oseph ] said that the way he knew in whom to confide , God told him in whom he might place confidence . "
Many of Joseph 's closest associates and those he trusted most brought damage to him and the church .
John C. Bennett of Nauvoo was a classic example , yet Mormon histories reject the opportunity to fully investigate these inconsistencies , choosing instead to portray Joseph as the noble prophet who could discern the intentions of peoples ' hearts .
( Intimate Chronicle p. 102 )
51 . Official Mormon histories have portrayed plural marriages as being as normal and as affectionate as monogamous marriages .
Some may have been .
However , Zina Diantha Huntington , when interviewed by a journalist from the New York World , in 1869 , drew a distinction between romantic love and plural marriage .
Commenting on women who were unhappy in their polygamous marriages , she said they " expect too much attention from the husband and …become sullen and morose … "
She insisted that the successful polygamous wife , " must regard her husband with indifference , and with no other feeling than that of reverence , for love we regard as a false sentiment ; a feeling which should have no existence in polygamy . "
Lucy Walker , who had been sealed for time to Heber C. Kimball , after the death of Joseph Smith said , " There was not any love in the union between myself and Kimball , and it is my business entirely whether there was any courtship or not …
It was the principle of plural marriage that we were trying to establish , a great and glorious true principle . "
( In Sacred Loneliness , pp. 108 , 466-467 )
52 . Joseph lied about lying when the Expositor was published in Nauvoo , accusing him of lying .
During the city council debate over some allegations made in the Expositor , Joseph declared that he had not kept the doctrine of polygamy secret but had taught it openly .
This was patently false .
William Clayton recorded that Emma Smith told him " it was the secret things which had cost Joseph and Hyrum their lives . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 367 ) Joseph 's inability to spin so many yarns at one time eventually cost him his life .
53 . Smith practiced polyandry but this fact is not published in official church instructional manuals .
Brigham Young continued the practice after the martyrdom of Smith .
In a particularly compelling example , which the church would understandably wish to suppress , Young wanted Zina D. Huntington Jacobs .
Smith had taken her as a plural wife with her husband Jacob 's consent while six months pregnant in October 1841 .
Henry Jacobs believed that " whatever the Prophet did was right . "
Zina and Henry continued to live together as husband and wife though she would belong to Joseph Smith in eternity .
( Mormon Polygamy , p. 45 ) It gets more bizarre .
During the Mormon trek west , at Mt. Pisgah , Iowa Brigham declared to Henry Jacobs , " the woman you claim for a wife does not belong to you .
She is the spiritual wife of brother Joseph , sealed up to him .
I am his proxy , and she , in this behalf , with her children are my property .
You can go where you please , and get another but be sure to get one of your own kindred spirit . "
( Van Wagoner , Mormon Polygamy : A History 2nd Edition , p. 44 )
Young , using his authority as the Lord 's mouthpiece on earth , ordered Jacobs to leave and go to England , to serve a mission for the church .
Brigham took Zina .
Henry was sick and his low spirits robbed him of his health .
He loved Zina and wrote letters expressing his love for her .
Astonishingly he also remained faithful to Brigham Young .
In a letter he wrote , " I do not blame any person or person , no ?
May the Lord our Father bless Brother Brigham and all pertains unto him forever … tell him for me I have no feelings against him nor never had … "
( Mormon Polygamy : A History , p. 45 ) .
The trappings of plural marriage are cited as one reason the LDS church is still viewed by many as a cult .
Polygamous behavior in LDS history resembles or even surpasses the exploits of Warren Jeffs , who was arrested and convicted for his crimes .
54 . Lying became such an integral practice with the Latter - day Saints , church leaders instructed members how to lie about polygamy , according to the testimony of members given under oath .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 365 )
55 . Loyalty was more important than honesty in the early church , and is still considered more vital than truth .
Joseph 's instruction to the Twelve in 1839 was that above all else , " do not betray your Friend . "
He frequently reminded members that they should honor friendships above all else even to death .
Currently , members are reminded often , under the guise of obedience to God , to " exhibit unquestioning faith , " code words for blind loyalty and obedience .
( Elder Robert Oaks , " Believe All Things , " Ensign , July 2005 , page 30 ; Link to content . )
The bold commandment to avoid critical thinking , abandon healthy skepticism , and blindly obey church leaders is another reason some outside the LDS church view it as a cult .
Many mainstream religious groups encourage critical thinking and questioning beliefs and practices .
56 . While the Danites ( a Mormon vigilante group ) were active in Missouri ( 1838 ) Justus Morse described how he and others were directed to help out a friend by lying ; and to " do it with such positiveness and assurance that no one would question our testimony . "
The greatest of evils according to Joseph in an 1839 address to the 12 were " sinning against the Holy Ghost and proving a traitor to the brethren . "
Smith confided that he deceived the saints by keeping secrets from them because they were " little children " unable to " bear all things now . "
Joseph counseled the Relief Society Sisters not to be overzealous in their search for wrongdoing and to be charitable toward the accused , after counseling them to seek out evil - doers months earlier .
Stories about adultery and spiritual wifery especially aggravated him .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 365-366 )
One would think that sexual predatory practices , raping and sexually assaulting teen aged girls in Nauvoo would have caused him to list this sin as one of the most abominable .
Since he was engaged in the practice of preying on teens , it likely did not occur to him .
57 .
In a well - publicized debate between John Taylor and a Protestant minister in 1850 , John Taylor denied that the Mormons practiced polygamy .
At the time , he was the husband of multiple wives .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 367 )
In a public discussion in Boulogne - Sur - Mer , France , he claimed , " … I shall content myself by reading our views of chastity and marriage , from a work published by us , containing some of the articles of our Faith .
Doctrine and Covenants , page 330 … Inasmuch as this Church of Jesus Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy , we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife , and one woman but one husband , except in case of death , when either is at liberty to marry again " ( Tract published by John Taylor in 1850 , p. 8 ; found in Orson Pratt 's Works , 1851 edition .
Found in The Changing World of Mormonism , pp. 261-262 ) .
Taylor knew that the real revelation on marriage was the one on plural marriage , but refused to admit it to his audience .
58 . Orson Pratt admitted that when called upon to defend the practice of polygamy , he deliberately misled his listeners .
He did not consider this to be lying .
It was done to protect a law higher than man 's misguided laws .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 367 ) Official LDS histories are not forthcoming about the role of lying as a defense for polygamous marriages .
59 . Charles W. Penrose , Apostle and Counselor to two Presidents of the Church , admitted that after Joseph Smith 's death , certain facts about him were purposely withheld from church publications " for prudential reasons . "
Expediency became a more important virtue than honesty ; deception was accepted as a necessary tool , while grass roots members were commanded to be honest and disciplined for dishonesty .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 367 ) Currently LDS historians are excommunicated precisely because they have written honest histories .

60 .
At the Mountain Meadows Massacre September 11 , 1857 , 120 innocent men , women and children as young as eight years old , in an Arkansas wagon train party were murdered in cold blood by Mormon church leaders and members .
Amasa Lyman and George A. Smith , Mormon Apostles , accused members who wanted to honestly testify to the facts of the case of stooping " to betray and expose their brethren into the hands of their enemies . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 367 )
To Mormon leaders , anyone who cooperated with law enforcement authorities investigating the murders was guilty of the sin of betrayal .
Betrayal was worse than the massacre of 120 innocent men , women and children in the minds of Apostles Smith and Lyman .
The events of 9-11-2001 are eerily similar to 9-11 - 1857 .
Both acts of senseless murder were the result of fanatical and unquestioning obedience to religious authority .
( Will Bagley , The Blood of the Prophets : Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows , pp. 157 , 176-177 )
61 . Lying was so prevalent as an institutional practice among church members during the 1860 's - 1880's , that John D. Hicks alleged that when " polygamists were prohibited from voting , the Mormons promptly swore that they were not polygamists ; when those who taught or practiced polygamy were discriminated against , everybody immediately became silent on the subject ; and when members of organizations which advocated polygamy were denied the ballot , they withdrew … from the Mormon Church " to become eligible to vote .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 368 )
This is reminiscent of the fake excommunication Joseph proposed to William Clayton in Nauvoo mentioned above .
62 . Mormon " children in theocratic , territorial and polygamous Utah were taught to lie about family relationships , their parents ' whereabouts , and even their own last names . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 368 ) Mormon parents are conscientious about teaching their children to be honest and to unquestioningly obey the LDS prophets and local leaders .
( Apostle M. Russell Ballard , " His Word Ye Shall Receive , " Ensign , May 2001 , p. 65 ) Link to content .
63 .
In a letter to President John Taylor in 1887 , Charles W. Penrose , a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , expressed concern that " the endless subterfuges and prevarications which our present condition impose … threaten to make our rising generation a race of deceivers . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 368 )
64 . While lobbying on behalf of the First Presidency in Washington , in 1887 for Utah statehood , Franklin S. Richards and John T. Caine prevaricated stating that polygamy was a " dead issue " in Utah and that it would n't be revived .
They attempted to explain away the church 's position on polygamy by saying that plurality was not a commandment and that " celestial " and " plural " marriages were not the same thing .
This was wholly untrue yet their conduct received approval from the First Presidency .
Apostle John Taylor admitted to church members in Nephi , Utah that the statements made in Washington were a " d ----d lie . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 369 ) Duplicity on the part of church leaders was not reserved only for those outside the church .
It was served up to members as well .
Current members are not informed in official church histories of the numerous lies promulgated by their revered prophets and apostles .
65 .
When explaining whether recommends were being issued to members to marry polygamously , one church authority said that " he no longer gave recommends for marrying plural wives but gave them for obtaining whatever blessings the Lord might bestow . "
He used these code words to subtly affirm that indeed recommends for plural marriage were still being issued , after assuring the American public that they were n't .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 370 )
Current members are encouraged to practice evasive missionary techniques when dealing with difficult questions from skeptics because they " need milk before meat . "
These are 20th and 21st century code words that encourage modern - day Mormons to practice lying by omission .
Missionaries ( formal and informal ) routinely are taught to disregard the principle of informed consent .
66 . The Manifesto of 1890 prohibiting polygamy , was in fact another attempt to dupe the U.S. government and to some extent , ordinary church members into believing that the LDS church intended to comply with the mandate of the government to abandon polygamy .
Church members at that time generally fell into two groups : ( 1 ) those who believed that the leaders only pretended to give in to government pressure to obtain statehood , and ( 2 ) those who believed that the Manifesto was necessary as a hedge against discovery of the true facts about polygamy in Utah .
Church leaders believed that if once given statehood , polygamy could be legalized by creating a provision for it in the new state constitution .
A fervent belief in a strict interpretation of states ' rights , fed their illusion .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 370 )
That church leaders chose to aggressively pursue lying as a strategy is unfortunate .
67 . Thomas J. Rosser was a missionary in Wales in 1908 .
He asked his mission president Charles W. Penrose if the 1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage was a revelation from God.
Making " no " into a long answer , Penrose replied , " Brethren , I will answer that question , if you will keep it under your hats .
I Charles W. Penrose wrote the manifesto with the assistance of Frank J. Cannon and John White … Wilford Woodruff signed it to beat the devil at his own game . "
The Manifesto , authored by Penrose , was submitted to a committee ?
Judges Charles S. Zane , C.S. Varian , and O.W. Powers , ( nonmembers ) .
The wording was changed slightly and the document was recopied by a clerk named Green .
( Samuel Taylor , The Rocky Mountain Empire , New York , NY , MacMillan , 1978 , p. 35 )
Official LDS histories and curriculum lead ordinary members to believe that the Manifesto was a sacred communication from God to church president Wilford Woodruff .
The curriculum materials do not inform members that ample documentation exists to prove that the 1890 Manifesto was one more trick to beat the devil ( federal government ) , as Penrose suggested .
It was anything but sacred communication between God and the LDS prophet .
( D. Michael Quinn , LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages , 1890 - 1904 , Dialogue : A Journal of Mormon Thought , Spring 1985 )
68 . In 1903 Wiley Nebeker of Afton , Wyoming wrote to Apostle John Henry Smith complaining that the church made use of deceit and duplicity to further the practice of polygamy , while assuring the federal government that church leaders no longer condoned the practice .
He wrote , " To be plain , while I am fully converted to the belief that this is a true principle , I am not converted to the idea that the Lord justifies deceit and falsehood . "
He did not believe saints ought to be forced into " apologizing to our own consciences . "
In response , Apostle Smith perpetuated the dishonesty by serving up more disinformation .
Rather than address the central issue of lying , Smith told Nebeker that the doctrine was true but no longer being practiced .
This was a calculated lie .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 371 )
69 . Florence , a daughter of Anthony W. Ivins asked her mother why her father seemed so upset following a meeting of the Apostles and the First Presidency .
Her mother told her that President Smith had said something in the meeting that greatly disturbed her father .
President Smith said , he " would lie any day to save [ his ] … brother . "
Florence said that it was her opinion that her father was troubled over the remark for the rest of his life .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 372 ) LDS histories refuse to be forthcoming about the important role that lying and duplicity played in church governance .
70 .
Deception as a management tool was frequently discussed in the leading councils of the church so leaders were counseled not to record notes from meetings in their personal diaries .
President Joseph F. Smith was afraid that someone might read the diaries of George Q. Cannon and Abraham H. Cannon and use the information against the church .
To this day , the church leaders refuse to allow researchers to examine the unabridged , uncensored diary of George Q. Cannon because of damaging evidence , proving that Church leaders did engage in institutionalized , systematic deceit .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 372 )
71 . After the 1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage , it appears that at least 250 plural marriages were performed despite repeated denials on the part of the church leadership .
The church 's current misinformation policy is effective because church members today and the media are still more likely than not , to believe that the Manifesto was a good faith effort on the part of church leaders to terminate the practice of polygamy .
John Henry Smith is alleged to have remarked that the Manifesto was only " a trick to beat the devil at his own game . "
( Reed Smoot Case , vol .
4 , p. 13 .
Solemn Covenant , p. 392 ) Church histories do not provide this information to ordinary members .
72 . During the 1890's the church tried to answer the criticism of opponents that a theocracy existed in Utah and church leaders controlled all elections .
So leaders instructed members to pretend to align with different political parties .
George Q. Cannon was asked about the degree of honesty in this strategy .
He said that the potential political gains that could be achieved made sincerity irrelevant in this case .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 372 )
The church motto seems to have been , " act sincere even if you do n't mean it . "
Official church histories choose not to provide this information to inquiring members .
73 . Matthias F. Cowley stated in a hearing before the Quorum of the Twelve in 1911 , that he had been chastised for asking for permission to pre-date post - 1890 plural marriages to make them appear to have occurred before the Manifesto .
He said he was trying to follow the " training I have had from those over me , " which was to act with duplicity without asking for permission , in order to preserve the image of plausible deniability for the church hierarchy .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 373 ) Plausible deniability is an important tool used by current church leaders .
74 . Ironically , after claiming that he had been taught to lie by previous leaders , Matthias F. Cowley also claimed " I am not dishonest and not a liar and have always been true to the work and to the brethren …
We have always been taught that when the brethren were in a tight place that it would not be amiss to lie to help them out . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 373 )
The ability to compartmentalize reached its peak in the minds of church leaders who idolized Joseph Smith and who jousted with the federal government over polygamy .
Currently , church history and curriculum writers continue to follow the same recipe for success .
They refuse to tell the truth about church history , leaving out uncomfortable truths that would require them to answer members ' questions about the character of past LDS leaders .
By refusing to publish unvarnished church history and curriculum , leaders and members can deny knowledge about unsavory historical truths , while pretending that those episodes did not occur .
75 . Related to the above quote , Cowley quoted a member of the First Presidency who he said had taught him that " he [ the member of the First Presidency ] would lie like hell to help the brethren . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 373 )
Many observers wonder if the same ethic is still in place today .
76 . Despite consistent denials that church leaders demanded complete and blind obedience , members were commanded that they should subordinate their judgment to that of their priesthood leaders .
Leaders dictated matters from the most trivial to the most profound and far reaching .
In fact , men refusing to go on missions were once told that they should anticipate relinquishing their wives for refusing to obey the Brethren .
This is at odds with the claim by modern leaders and apologists that members of the LDS Church have always been counseled to exercise their own agency and think for themselves .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 373 )
This tension exists currently between one 's individual agency and the church 's demands for blind obedience , loyalty and conformity .
77 . Modern leaders of the church have used general conference as a platform to condemn the practice of situational ethics .
Yet Joseph Smith 's letter to Nancy Rigdon sent to convince her to become a plural wife is the epitome of situational ethics .
It said , " That which is wrong under one circumstance , may be , and often is , right under another ….
Whatever God requires is right , no matter what it is , although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire … .
But in obedience there is joy and peace unspotted . "
Mormons often translate teachings about unquestioning obedience , and treating leaders as infallible into : " You do n't question things .
If the leaders suggest it , you obey and you will be blessed . "
This principle and practice tends to relegate honesty to a lower priority than blind obedience and conformity to Church leaders .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 374 .
Mormon Polygamy , p. 32 .
For excellent examples see Link to content . )
78 . Henry S. Tanner explained that when he was forced to lie to protect himself or the church then the word he spoke ( lies told to civil authorities under oath ) had no binding power .
He believed that the Mormons would be regarded by God as having made no promises nor be accountable for lies told to protect the church .
Tanner and others blamed the government for making them lie .
Lying was elevated from duplicity and degraded communication to a religious duty .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 374-375 )
Modern church history is silent regarding this practice .
79 . Carl A. Badger , who was not a church member , acted as a friend and counselor to the church leaders during the Smoot hearings ( 1903 - 1907 ) .
During those hearings it was discovered that the church leaders had lied and deceived the federal government about its intentions to rid the church of polygamy for decades .
Badger concluded that the church had decided that some things were more important than honesty .
He said that the result was moral confusion .
George D. Kirby , writing in the Improvement Era in 1910 , admitted as much when he answered charges that Mormons were deceitful .
He wrote that there might be " truth in the charges . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 376 ) Current LDS histories reject the suggestion to be forthcoming about church leaders ' dishonesty and duplicity .
80 . United States Senators participating in the Smoot hearings where church leaders repeatedly and systematically lied under oath , determined that the decision to lie to protect polygamy and church leaders ' practice of it , ultimately led to charges of casuistry , secrecy , and moral contradiction .
Many concluded that Mormon leaders consistently stood for honesty as long as their own affairs were not involved ?
or when it was convenient .
A gentile expressed it this way , " When any of us [ non - members ] sin…we sin for our own sakes . "
But when a saint lied , it was done " for Christ 's sake . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 376 )
81 . The Salt Lake Tribune was at odds with the LDS church 's duplicity in the late 19th century as it related to polygamy and the Church 's control of civil government .
Adding to the disgust of Tribune editors was that the church claimed to be the Lord 's special vessel of truth , but so often refused to live up to the honor .
Tribune editors rejected the claim that institutionalized lying and deception was necessary to protect the Lord 's church .
The paper claimed something hard to refute ; that it was impossible " for a Mormon Elder to be a new polygamist without at the same time being a liar . "
Church leaders compounded the problem by claiming that they had always been honest .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 377 ) Current LDS leaders face the same problem .
82 . Mormons were inventive in their ability to distort the truth and at the same time , convince themselves that they were honest .
B. Carmon Hardy has written , " In addition to semantic usages such as union and sealing , thus permitting denials of plural marriage , reference has also been made to instances involving the marrying of two wives on the same day ; reliance on the fact that women were always sealed to men , allowing their husbands to deny that they had married polygamously ; use of proxies ; marrying a new wife legally , after the death of a prior legal spouse , while maintaining relationships with earlier plurals ; the performance of ceremonies at sea or in foreign countries ; and resort to concubinage .
The variety of ruses employed will never fully be numbered . "
( Solemn Covenant , p. 377 ) Modern church history and curriculum continue the duplicity by refusing to fully admit to the lies of the past leaders .
83 . John Taylor claimed to have received a revelation in 1886 .
He declared that God revealed that those wishing to inherit the highest degree of the celestial kingdom must continue to live the principle of plural marriage , no matter what pressure was brought to bear against them by the federal government and its laws .
Ironically , modern polygamists point to the same divine revelation as their commission to carry out the dictate of the Lord 's anointed , in order to keep plural marriage alive until the millennium .
They also use lies , deception and codes to mislead law officers .
Dorothy Allred Solomon confessed , " Although we were reared to treasure truth and cling to the light , our way of life was filled with secrets . "
This readiness to deceive has been referred to as " Mormon logic . "
Sometimes they " disobey a lesser law to keep a higher one . "
Another irony is that modern members are highly critical of the tactics of the modern polygamists , who borrowed the tactics from Mormon polygamists in the 1800's .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 378 )
84 .
One subtle way of deceiving government agents was for church members to say that the church had abandoned polygamy .
But individual priesthood leaders might still take new wives .
Thus the rationale was that though the church had abandoned the practice , the priesthood had not .
This allowed church leaders to act in a dual role - either as corporate spokesman or individual priesthood holder .
At least as far back as President John Taylor , it was understood by some that the responsibility for encouraging plural marriage had been taken from the church and extended to everybody " upon his own responsibility . "
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 378-379 )
This reasoning is why polygamy among fundamentalist Mormons is alive and well today .
85 . Apostle John W. Taylor married Janet Maria
Wooley as his third wife only four days after the Manifesto banning plural marriage was presented and accepted in general conference .
They married in a carriage in Liberty Park at night in Salt Lake City .
The family intentionally backdated the marriage date to 10 October 1889 .
Apostle John W. Taylor married Rhoda and Roxie Welling on 29 August 1901 ( 11 years after the Manifesto ) .
The ceremony was performed at the Taylor home in Farmington , Utah .
Joseph F. Smith , who was acting as a counselor in the First Presidency , gave permission .
The subterfuge was regarded as virtuous and necessary by church leaders .
( Solemn Covenant pp. 206-207 ) Lying for convenience ' sake was strikingly similar to lying for Christ 's sake .
86 . Brigham Young Jr. took a plural wife the year before the 1890 Manifesto was published and another in August 1901 , despite President Woodruff 's insistence ( in the Manifesto - 1890 ) that no such marriages had been solemnized prior to its publication .
He must have known better , because Young was president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles .
Later , during a historical debate over B.H. Roberts ' attempt to take his seat as an elected representative to the U. S. House of Representatives , Brigham Young Jr. publicly asserted that President Snow 's denials regarding the continued practice of polygamy in the church after the Manifesto were true .
Lying for the Lord knew no bounds .
87 . Brigham Young Jr. was quoted as teaching that he had " naught but contempt for all forms of hypocrisy or deceit . "
His half - sister said of him , " He can keep still but must not deceive . "
Mormon leaders developed a blind spot when it came to their own dishonesty .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 207-208 )
Current leaders maintain blind spots when it comes to honesty in the 21st century .
88 . Apostle Marriner W. Merrill took a plural wife in the Logan Temple in 1901 , well after the Manifesto was accepted as binding upon the church .
He denied under oath in front of the Senate committee investigating Reed Smoot that he had married Hilda after 1890 .
Though the committee possessed solid evidence that he was lying he continued to insist that he was telling the truth .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 208 ) Perhaps consistency was more important than honesty .
These tactics turned the public against Mormons .
89 .
The son of Wilford Woodruff , Abraham Owen Woodruff , married 18 year - old Eliza Avery Clark as a plural wife in 1901 ( 11 years after his father presented the Manifesto ) .
She was previously engaged to a young man living in Wyoming where she resided with her family .
After Apostle Matthias F. Cowley persuaded her to marry Woodruff , she broke her engagement and consented to marry Woodruff .
Cowley performed the ceremony in Preston , Idaho .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 208-209 )
Modern church members might be stunned to learn of the disregard for the law demonstrated by church leaders .
In a modern members ' mind it would conflict with the covenant to obey the laws of the land .
( D&C 134:1 " We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man ; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them … . " )
90 .
Apostle Rudger Clawson married a plural wife in 1904 ( 14 years after the Manifesto had been accepted as binding on the church ) .
He married Pearl Udall as a second wife with his wife 's consent .
Apostle Marriner W. Merril spoke directly to younger members of the Quorum of the Twelve and advised them not to neglect the opportunity to build up a kingdom for themselves ( a euphemism for polygamy ) .
Clawson took the command from his superior seriously , though it meant contradicting the Manifesto .
After the marriage , Merrill counseled young Clawson to mislead those looking for evidence of post - Manifesto plural marriages by writing misleading entries in a diary , or simply neglecting to record them .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 211 )
One waits for modern church leaders to denounce the practice of institutional lying .
91 . Abraham Hoagland Cannon ( an LDS Apostle ) married Annie Cannon after President Woodruff gave him consent to do so , in 1894 , four years after the Manifesto declared an end to all plural marriages .
Annie was taken as a concubine .
Apparently church leaders had considered this practice from 1843 on when the revelation to Joseph about plural marriage mentioned that the Lord approved concubinage .
Modern church history refuses to admit that this practice ?
adultery ?was part of the church 's practice of plural marriage .
92 . Church leader , George M. Cannon suggested the concubinage method of plural marriage to Abraham Cannon ( his son ) and said , " I believe in concubinage , or some plan whereby men and women can live together under sacred ordinances and vows until they can be married . "
He insisted that such relationships must be kept secret until the government changed its laws .
He added that concubinage would open up a way to take care of " our surplus girls " as well as fulfill the command to multiply and replenish the earth .
Despite protests by contemporary Mormons that polygamy established high standards of decency and morality , and was different than adultery or keeping mistresses , Cannon 's behavior proves otherwise .
Fifteen lines are cut out of his diary for October 1894 , three days after his visit with Annie and Uncle George Q. Cannon , where the suggestion regarding concubinage was made .
Though Annie lived to be 79 years of age , there is no record of her having been married .
She is said to have accompanied Abraham Cannon on numerous excursions and she refused a proposal for marriage from prominent LDS member , Heber Bennion .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 214-215 )
93 . President George Q. Cannon appears to have entered into a concubinage - like relationship with Amelia Madsen one year before his death and well after the Manifesto was presented .
She was past child - bearing age .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 215 )
94 . Joseph F. Smith performed a secret marriage for Abraham H. Cannon and Lilian Hamlin .
The four ( Abraham and Lilian , and Joseph F. and a wife ) traveled by train to California .
On the way to Catalina Island by boat , the marriage was solemnized on the vessel .
LDS Leaders believed that solemnizing marriages on water permitted them to say they had not performed marriages " in " the U.S. ? or " on U.S. soil . "
Abraham contracted an ear infection on the trip and after returning home to Salt Lake died .
Before expiring he confessed to Wilhelmina , his first wife that he had married Lilian Hamlin and she presumed that Joseph F. Smith had performed the ceremony since he was the only authority of the church present .
Nevertheless , during the Smoot hearings Joseph F. Smith consistently denied having performed the marriage .
Those who have investigated the facts have little trouble dismissing Joseph F. Smith 's denials as pure prevarications .
To further confuse those who might be interested in the marriage , Joseph F. Smith traveled under the assumed name Orson Smith , a code name for his own person .
It allowed Smith to deny that he ( Joseph F. Smith ) performed the ceremony .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 219-220 )
Many a children wish that they had the ability to use such clever deception after getting caught with a hand in the cookie jar !
95 . Apostle George Teasdale married a plural wife , Marion Scoles secretly in October of 1897 .
His diary entries for the 23rd to the 28th of October are missing .
These are the dates when the couple traveled together and were married .
He later married another wife , Letitia Dolly Thomas on 17 May 1900 .
Both marriages occurred after the 1904 * Manifesto banning plural marriage .
Teasdale divorced Lillias Hook , a former wife to try avoid scandal , because the Salt Lake Tribune had begun to investigate the matter .
President Joseph F. Smith told the Smoot committee that Lillias had never been a real wife to Teasdale ?
only an elderly housekeeper .
She had been sealed to Teasdale in name only as a favor to her , Smith told the committee .
To the contrary , Lillias was only 35 when she was married to Teasdale , hardly elderly .
She was 8 years younger than Teasdale .
Teasdale 's divorce complaint from Lillias stated that she was unable to have sexual intercourse .
Yet he remained married to her for decades before divorcing her .
Incongruously , the records of the Twentieth Ward in SLC where Lillias lived , list one George Vivian Teasdale , born on 11 June 1896 , and name George and Lillias Teasdale as the parents .
( Solemn Covenant , 221- 226 )
Church apologist and history claims that no plural marriages took place after the 1904 * Manifesto .
And they refuse to tell investigators about the long history of deception ; a violation of the ethical principle of full disclosure .
There is a credibility gap that the LDS church continues to keep in place , while wondering why the American public sometimes refers to their church as a cult , similar to Scientology .
[ * 1890 ? ]
96 . Bogus divorce in order to mislead legal authorities was acceptable .
The logic was that if a fake divorce was necessary to live the higher law of polygamy it was justified .
Also , Mormons believed that earthly divorce was not binding in heaven anyway .
In the eyes of the Lord , the couple was still married .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 226-227 )
97 . Ninety year - old President Wilford Woodruff took a new plural wife in 1897 , one year before his death .
He married Lydia Mamreoff von Finkelstein Mountford who was 49 years - old .
She was a guest lecturer in Salt Lake City , having been invited by James E. Talmage .
President Woodruff was captivated by her .
She was baptized in February 1897 .
They traveled together to California and used assumed names when registering in a hotel in Portland , Oregon .
Between 20 and 22 September 1897 , they were married while sailing back to Portland from California .
At the time , Mountford was the legal wife of Charles Edwin Mountford .
This would not be the first instance of plural marriage to a woman still legally married .
Joseph Smith practiced that concept at least 11 times ( In Sacred Loneliness , pp. 15 -23 ) .
It has always been postulated that whatever others did after the Manifesto , President Woodruff had honored the " revelation . "
The marriage was later solemnized by proxy in the Salt Lake Temple in 1920 , making the illegal marriage valid and honorable in the eyes of Mormon leadership .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 228-232 )
98 . The LDS leaders ' constant use of prevarication turned friends against them .
Theodore Schroeder , once friendly to the Mormons became a bitter enemy when he discovered the extent of the deceit used by church leaders and members alike .
In 1897 he wrote essays exposing the continued practice of polygamy , despite denials issued by the church .
He set out to prove that the church had consistently lied about its involvement with polygamy since the Nauvoo period .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 246 )
99 . B.H. Roberts admitted taking plural wives as late as April 1890 during the Smoot Hearings , contradicting President Woodruff 's statement in the Manifesto that no such marriages had taken place in the year preceding the Manifesto .
Roberts was probably lying about the year he married his last plural wife , Dr. Milford Shipp .
She was still legally married and lived with her husband until 1892 .
The marriage to Roberts most likely occurred in 1894 .
Roberts managed to expose both he and President Woodruff as deceivers at the same time .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 247 )
100 .
When B.H. Roberts was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives after Utah became a state , the House voted to exclude him because an investigation revealed that Roberts was engaged in polygamous marriage and that one of his wives had married him after the Manifesto .
Since it was a clear violation of the law of the land , and he and the LDS leadership had ignored society 's legal code , he was declared unfit for office .
Seven million citizens signed a petition demanding that Roberts be denied his seat and it was presented to Congress .
Those considered enemies by church leaders were provided a national platform to advertise abundant evidence of dishonesty on the part of Mormon Church leaders and members .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 249 , 250 ) Official church histories and curriculum neglect to inform members and non-members of this and related incidents .
Nor have they denounced the deceptive practices .
101 . Reed Smoot was elected to the United States Senate in 1902 and federal lawmakers protested immediately .
He was sworn into office in March 1903 .
But government authorities feared that Smoot was a polygamous sympathizer , though not a polygamist himself .
It was also a well - established fact that the church had engaged in deception for decades to evade the law .
Because of the church 's reputation for dishonesty , the Smoot investigation lasted more than 3 years ( 1904 - 1907 ) and resulted in over 3,000 pages of sworn testimony .
The scope of the inquiry broadened to include the history , theology and culture of Mormonism itself .
If the citizens of the U.S. doubted the honesty and veracity of the Mormon leaders and their people before the hearings , afterward they did not doubt due to mountains of testimony and documented evidence .
The Mormons were guilty of unending prevarication .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 251 ) Mormon histories and curriculum have never admitted to leaders ' past duplicity though it would be the honorable thing to do .
Failure to admit to past duplicity continues to serve as a source of embarrassment to many members of the LDS church , interested in studying church history .
102 . President Joseph F. Smith was the first witness called and placed under oath to tell the whole truth before the Smoot investigation .
His testimony may have been the most damaging .
He pled incredible ignorance concerning the polygamous activities that he personally permitted and encouraged .
Yet he admitted to fathering children by five ( 5 ) wives since 1890 , after the Manifesto had been issued .
103 . President Smith categorically denied that Presidents Woodruff and Snow had authorized polygamous marriages after the Manifesto in 1890 .
He knew that to be false .
He went on to say that he had not heard anyone " advocate , encourage or recommend " plural marriages since the Manifesto .
This was false .
U.S. leaders and citizens joined with the LDS members in disbelief that President Smith would blatantly lie under oath - denying what others plainly knew to be true .
One witness suggested tongue in cheek that President Smith was using his words differently than the way most people use them .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 253 )
104 .
Mormon apologist histories complain about the " persecution " heaped upon President Smith at the hearings by unscrupulous legislators , and praise his honorable and dignified responses .
The truth is : the constant stream of duplicity and lies increased the public 's hostility toward Mormons .
Most were disgusted with the Mormon Prophet , Seer , and Revelator who refused to come forth with a degree of honesty while under oath before the Senate hearings .
( Solemn Covenant , pp.253-254 )
105 .
George Reynolds antagonized hearing participants when he lied about knowing that his own daughter had married Benjamin Cluff ( president of the Brigham Young academy ) as a plural wife .
He made the fantastic claim that since the Manifesto was issued 13 years prior , he had never spoken to anyone either for or against the practice .
Reynolds had to be persuaded by Smoot to refrain from testifying that though his daughter was married , he knew nothing about it .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 253-254 )
106 .
Under oath at the Smoot hearings , Apostle Hyrum M. Smith , son of President Joseph F. Smith testified that he had no recollection of the subject of polygamy being discussed in any of the meetings of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles .
Then he contradicted himself by assuring the committee that if the subject was discussed , the Twelve were urged to stamp out the practice .
Both statements were lies .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 254 )
107 . Church leader Francis M. Lyman lied under oath when he told investigators that although everyone else in Utah was aware of continued cohabitation with plural wives , Senator Smoot was unaware of the practice .
The interrogator followed that response and inquired if Smoot was uninformed about the state he was supposed to represent .
Lyman contradicted himself by stating that Smoot was probably better informed than anyone else about domestic practices in the state he represented .
To make matters worse , Lyman claimed that he was being guided by the Spirit of the Lord in his responses .
When the interrogator asked Lyman if he was blaming the Lord for the contradictions ( lies ) within his testimony , Lyman had no reply .
He added later that polygamy was a mystery of the kingdom .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 254 )
108 .
Under oath , Apostle John Henry Smith testified that he could n't remember his own birth date , as well as other easily recalled facts about his life that he claimed he could not recollect .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 254 )
These and other episodes in church history are virtually unknown to ordinary Mormons .
109 . Apostle Marriner W. Merrill swore that he had taken no plural wives since the Manifesto , though it was widely known that he had taken one in 1901 ( eleven years after the Manifesto ) .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 254 )
110 . Senator - to - be Reed Smoot , testified that he had no knowledge that " any apostle or any member of the Presidency " had taken a plural wife since 1890 , except for the cases he learned of at the hearings .
This was demonstrably false as later testimony by Smoot proved , when he contradicted himself .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 255 )
111 . Under oath at the Smoot hearings , President Joseph F. Smith testified that church inquiries into polygamous marriages or the arrangement of plural marriages by church leaders in Salt Lake was an issue delegated to the local units to investigate .
He did this despite being one of those , along with other church leaders , who orchestrated the marriages .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 255 )
112 . President Smith promised under oath to arrange for church leaders to cooperate and appear before the Smoot hearings to testify about the issue of polygamy in Utah .
Yet , after returning to Salt Lake , he wrote to Senator Burrows that several apostles could not travel to the hearings on account of ill health .
He wrote that he could not persuade Apostles Taylor and Cowley to appear .
These excuses qualify as pre-meditated deceit .
President Smith had the power to require the apostles to appear .
To compound the deception , Teasdale and others who supposed to be suffering from fragile health took several long journeys ( Mexico , Arizona and Canada ) , and the trips had no ill effects on their health .
In fact , Teasdale traveled to Mexico and Canada to run beyond the grasp of the interrogators at the Smoot hearings .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 256-257 )
113 . Church leaders attempted to persuade Anthony W. Ivins to sign an affidavit that they knew to be categorically untrue .
Being a rare LDS man of conscience , Ivins refused to sign it .
The purpose of the document was to certify that no plural marriages occurred in Mexico after the Manifesto .
Most members are unaware that church leaders pressured others to lie .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 257 )
114 .
Because of the damaging testimony at the Smoot hearings , public perception of the Mormons was that they and their leaders were liars .
Smoot wanted the leaders to take steps to repair the damage they had caused .
Consequently , President Smith read a statement that compounded the problem of negative perception .
The statement denied that plural marriages had been performed in the church after the 1890 Manifesto , and denied that new plural marriages were being performed .
Both statements were false .
In fact , he had sanctioned many marriages since the Manifesto .
He also stated that those who had had marriages solemnized since the Manifesto were subject to excommunication from the church .
This was also a lie .
Finally , Smith blasted the committee for accusing church leaders of being dishonest .
( Solemn Covenant , pp. 259-260 )
One may as well lie in big bunches , if one is determined lie .
115 . Apostle Francis M. Lyman sent a message to Apostle Teasdale and admitted that plural marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto ( issued to convince the outside world that the practice had been stopped ) had shaken the confidence of the members in their leaders .
He also admitted to Teasdale that church leaders were perceived to be dishonest and untrustworthy because of their deception in the Smoot hearings .
( Solemn Covenant , p. 261 ) Current LDS apologists are reluctant to admit dishonesty on the part of their leaders , or they find creative ways to characterize their behavior as noble and praiseworthy ; as if they had no choice .
Prophets who claim to commune with God , and direct the only true church on earth , are placed on pedestals as models of virtue .
Current church members assume that LDS leaders were / are men of principle .
116 .
After the Smith Manifesto ( 1904 ) denying that plural marriages were being performed , and that those participating in them would be excommunicated , church leaders ordered Anthony W. Ivins in Mexico , to quickly marry at least two couples who had intended to marry polygamously before word of the statement was officially taken personally to outlying Mormon settlements .
This action contradicted the letter as well as the spirit of the statement read b
Too easy and too short ...
But in the fact , I liked it :)
Try more musics and medals :)

A bus carrying Syrian workers in northern Lebanon has come under fire and at least one person has been shot dead , security sources say .
Several others were reported injured by shattered glass during the attack .
The incident took place near an army checkpoint in the Deir Emar district , some three miles ( 5 km ) north of the city of Tripoli .
The bus was taking Syrian labourers along the main highway between northern Lebanon and Syria .
One eyewitness said the vehicle 's tyres had bullet holes and several windows on the driver 's side were shattered by the shots .
According to the French news agency AFP , the person killed was a 17 - year - old labourer .
The attack occurred a day after Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri completed a two - day visit to Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad .

Unedited Transcript
Rare close - up video of a Sumatran tiger and two cubs was captured recently in a camera trap in the jungle of Indonesia ’s Sumatra Island .
WWF set up the cameras to help monitor the population of the tigers in their primary breeding grounds , which the WWF says is under threat from poaching and deforestation .
The tigers approached the camera , sniffed it , and then walked away .
The noise you hear is one of the tigers off - camera inspecting the apparatus .
WWF says the footage is a ‘ cause for celebration . ’
The group says it ’s the first time they ’ve recorded evidence of tiger breeding in central Sumatra .
There are as few as 400 Sumatran tigers left in Indonesia .
The WWF says the tiger habitat is threatened by companies clearing the forest for paper and palm oil production , as well as illegal logging .
The infrared - triggered camera traps are activated when they sense body heat in their path .
These cameras were placed nearly a month ago along a wildlife ‘ corridor ’ known to be used by tigers .
Let ’s Have a Ball Down at the Globes ( TV Edition )
The announcements have been made , and the nominations for the 67th Golden Globe Awards are now officially a matter of public record , but just in case you have n’t caught them elsewhere ( which , to be fair , is highly possible ) , here ’s my look at the TV series , mini-series , and movies which received nods , along with my personal picks for who should take home the win for each category .
Best Television Series – Drama
• Big Love ( HBO )
• Dexter ( Showtime )
• House ( Fox )
• Mad Men ( AMC )
• True Blood ( HBO )
My pick : “ Mad Men . ” Regular readers of Premium Hollywood had probably already narrowed my pick down to two entries , anyway , since I ’m the designated blogger for both “ True Blood ” and “ Mad Men , ” but while “ True Blood ” had a strong season that was tarnished slightly by an unsatisfying finale , “ Mad Men ” offered up a full - fledged game - changer for the conclusion of their third year .
The most notable omission from this list , however , is “ Sons of Anarchy , ” which you could almost write off as being too harsh for the voters if you did n’t have a drama about a serial killer in the mix .
Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Drama
• Glenn Close , “ Damages ” ( FX )
• January Jones , “ Mad Men ” ( AMC )
• Julianna Marguiles , “ The Good Wife ” ( CBS )
• Anna Paquin , “ True Blood ” ( HBO )
• Kyra Sedgwick , “ The Closer ” ( TNT )
My pick : Julianna Marguiles .
I know full well that it ’s a dark horse pick that almost certainly wo n’t pay off , but “ The Good Wife ” has been my favorite drama of the new season , and Marguiles offers a multi- layered performance as Alicia Florrick , a woman having to struggle with the media shining the spotlight on her husband ’s infidelity and political and legal misdealings while she ’s trying to return to a career as a litigator .
And am I the only one who scoffed somewhat at January Jones ’ nomination ?
Of the three primary “ Mad Men ” actresses , she ’s the last I would ’ve nominated , and this is one case where I think most would agree with me .
Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Drama
• Simon Baker , “ The Mentalist ” ( CBS )
• Michael C. Hall , “ Dexter ” ( Showtime )
• Jon Hamm , “ Mad Men ” ( AMC )
• Hugh Laurie , “ House ” ( Fox )
• Bill Paxton , “ Big Love ” ( HBO )
My pick : Hugh Laurie , “ House . ”
God love Jon Hamm , but I said of the “ House ” season premiere back in September that it was “ strong enough to warrant giving Hugh Laurie an Emmy nomination no matter what else he may do on the show during the course of the season ’s subsequent episodes , ” and I stand by that .
Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy
• 30 Rock ( NBC )
• Entourage ( HBO )
• Glee ( Fox )
• Modern Family ( ABC )
• The Office ( NBC )
My pick : “ Glee . ”
As much as I ’d like to see “ Modern Family ” take home the award , I think that even the people who ca n’t stand “ Glee ” will agree that it ’s one of the most original shows on television right now .
Combine that with the ridiculous sales of the show ’s soundtrack recordings , and I just ca n’t conceive of any other show taking home the award .
Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy
• Toni Collette , “ United States of Tara ” ( Showtime )
• Courtney Cox , “ Cougar Town ” ( ABC )
• Edie Falco , “ Nurse Jackie ” ( Showtime )
• Tina Fey , “ 30 Rock ” ( NBC )
• Lea Michele , “ Glee ” ( Fox )
My pick : Tina Fey , “ 30 Rock . ”
Even if she was n’t the driving force of the series behind the camera , I ’d still pick Fey , just because she is n’t afraid to make herself look and sound completely ridiculous .
But with that said , I absolutely dig Lea Michele ’s work on “ Glee ” and certainly would n’t complain if she won instead .
( Just as a closing note , while I know a lot of people might favor Toni Collette , it just seems like too easy a pick to me . )
Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy
• Alec Baldwin , “ 30 Rock ” ( NBC )
• Steve Carell , “ The Office ” ( NBC )
• David Duchovny , “ Californication ” ( Showtime )
• Thomas Jane , “ Hung ” ( HBO )
• Matthew Morrison , “ Glee ” ( Fox )
My pick : Steve Carell , “ The Office . ”
No one on TV makes me cringe more … and I mean that as a compliment .
If I ’m to be perfectly honest , though , I think Jim Parsons from “ The Big Bang Theory ” deserved a nomination , possibly instead of Thomas Jane .
Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television
• Georgia O’Keeffe ( Lifetime )
• Grey Gardens ( HBO )
• Into the Storm ( HBO )
• Little Dorrit ( PBS )
• Taking Chance ( HBO )
My pick : “ Taking Chance . ”
The others are all strong , but this one ’s arguably the most moving .
Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television
• Joan Allen , “ Georgia O’Keeffe ” ( Lifetime )
• Drew Barrymore , “ Grey Gardens ” ( HBO )
• Jessica Lange , “ Grey Gardens ” ( HBO )
• Anna Paquin , “ The Courageous Heart of Irena ” ( CBS )
• Sigourney Weaver , “ Prayers for Bobby ” ( Lifetime )
My pick : Drew Barrymore , “ Grey Gardens . ”
Anyone who ’s skeptical of Barrymore ’s ability to act in anything other than light comedies need look no further than this film .
Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini -Series or Motion Picture Made for Television
• Kevin Bacon , “ Taking Chance ” ( HBO )
• Kenneth Branagh , “ Wallander : One Step Behind ” ( BBC )
• Chiwetel Ejiofor , “ Endgame ” ( PBS )
• Brendan Gleeson , “ Into the Storm ” ( HBO )
• Jeremy Irons , “ Georgia O’Keeffe ” ( Lifetime )
My pick : Chiwetel Ejiofor , “ Endgame . ”
Another dark horse pick , but if you saw it , then you know how good Ejiofor was in it .
But , then again , he ’s good in just about everything .
It ’s a given , however , that I ’d be fine with Bacon takin’ it .
Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series , Mini-Series , or Motion Picture Made for Television
• Jane Adams , “ Hung ” ( HBO )
• Rose Byrne , “ Damages ” ( FX )
• Jane Lynch , “ Glee ” ( Fox )
• Janet McTeer , “ Into the Storm ” ( HBO )
• Chloe Sevigny , “ Big Love ” ( HBO )
My pick : Rose Byrne , “ Damages . ”
It takes a strong actress to hold her own again Glenn Close , but for two seasons running , Byrne ’s proved herself capable of doing just that .
Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series , Mini-Series , or Motion Picture Made for Television
• Michael Emerson , “ Lost ” ( ABC )
• Neil Patrick Harris , “ How I Met Your Mother ” ( CBS )
• William Hurt , “ Damages ” ( FX )
• John Lithgow , “ Dexter ” ( Showtime )
• Jeremy Piven , “ Entourage ” ( HBO )
My pick : John Lithgow , “ Dexter . ”
Is it me , or is this one of the most ridiculous races in recent awards history ?
Not that Barney Stinson and Ari Gold are n’t anti-heroes in their own way , but pitting them against Arthur Mitchell and Benjamin Linus hardly seems fair .
I have to admit that I have n’t caught up on “ Dexter ” this season , but given the raves that Lithgow ’s been getting for his work on the show , I ’d be a fool to bet against him , especially since his performance is going to be the freshest in voters ’ minds .
Apple is planning to launch a new version of the iPhone which will work almost anywhere in the world , according to American technology experts .
The " worldwide " version of the iPhone will be sold first in the US market next summer by Verizon Wireless , in which Vodafone has a 45 % stake , according to Ashok Kumar , analyst at Northeast Securities .
The new phone will use a microchip developed by Qualcomm that can use both the 3G networks which predominate in Europe and Africa as well as the CDMA2000 network used by Verizon in the US and other networks across the world .
" This Qualcomm - powered world phone will facilitate Apple to be carrier - agnostic , " Kumar said , meaning it would be able to further expand its list of mobile network partners .
Kumar 's prediction follows a recent report by industry analysts OTR Global which quoted sources in the Taiwan handset supply chain as saying they had been contracted to supply a " hybrid " iPhone by the third quarter of 2010 .
When Apple initially launched the iPhone in 2007 it did so under exclusive deals with network partners in the US , UK , France and Germany .
Since then , however , it has abandoned this strategy in order to sell iPhones through many more mobile phone networks across the world .
Earlier this week , Orange started selling the iPhone in the UK , ending O2 's two - year long exclusive deal .
Orange reckons that it had sold over 30,000 by 4 pm on the first day of sales , while Carphone Warehouse believes it will sell a 1 m iPhones by Christmas .
The success of the iPhone has made Apple the world 's most profitable smartphone manufacturer , according to research firm Strategy Analytics , overtaking the world 's largest handset producer , Nokia .
The research firm has examined the smartphone market for the three months to the end of September – in which 43 m phones that can access the web , send emails and download applications were sold – and reckons that Apple surpassed Nokia for the first time ever .
" We estimate Apple 's operating profit for its iPhone handset division stood at $ 1.6bn in the third quarter of 2009 , " said Alex Spektor , analyst at Strategy Analytics .
" Apple overtook Nokia for the first time , which recorded a lower $ 1.1 bn of operating profit .
With strong volumes , high wholesale prices and tight cost controls , the PC vendor has successfully broken into the mobile phone market in just two years . "
Nokia has struggled to produce a lucrative rival to the iPhone .
The Apple device has also spawned a host of touchscreen devices from other handset manufacturers including HTC , Samsung and Motorola , all of which have eaten into Nokia 's share of a smartphone market it once dominated .
Last month , Nokia announced its first quarterly loss for more than a decade .
The slew of touchscreen phones that have hit the shops have helped the smartphone market outperform the rest of the mobile phone industry , where sales have been in decline .
But Nokia does not seem able to capitalise on the fact that consumers want high - end devices and its share of the smartphone market is slipping .
Last month , Nokia said it reckoned the entire mobile phone industry shipped 288 m units in the quarter , down 7 % on the same period a year ago , but up 7 % on the second quarter .
Nokia , however , shipped 108.5 m units in the third quarter , which is down 8 % on the same period last year and only up 5 % on the previous quarter .
Nokia stripped out smartphone sales from the overall figures , estimating that 47 m " converged mobile devices " were shipped in the three months , compared with an estimated 44.2 m units in the third quarter of 2008 and 41 m units in the second quarter of 2009 .
Of that total figure , Nokia sold 16.4 m units in the third quarter of 2009 ; that is down from 16.9 m in the second quarter of 2009 but admittedly a better performance than the 15.5 m it shipped in the third quarter of the previous year .
Just a week after the results were announced , Nokia took the dramatic step of launching a legal attack on Apple in the US courts , alleging the iPhone infringes 10 of its patents in a dispute that could drag on for years .
Until now , only one species of sturgeon was known in France : the European sturgeon .
Nathalie Desse- Berset , an archeozoologist at CNRS ( 1 ) , has just shown , for the first time , that another species previously unknown in France used to be present in French waters : the Atlantic sturgeon .
This species already existed in the French Atlantic region at the end of the Neolithic 5 000 years ago , and was still thriving 3 000 years later .
Moreover , at that time European and Atlantic sturgeons co-existed at some sites .
This discovery is of major importance for programs for the reintroduction of sturgeons into European rivers .
These results , published in Comptes - rendus de l'Académie des sciences in mid-December , are a starting point for new research not only in archeozoology but also in paleoecology and paleogenetics , aimed at obtaining more information about these populations , which are in danger of extinction throughout the whole of Europe .
In France , the sturgeon is the largest fish that migrates to rivers in order to reproduce , while most of its growth takes place at sea .
It is also one of the most endangered fish in Europe : there probably remain only a few tens or hundreds of individuals .
Due to overfishing , dams , pollution and other factors that are harmful to the species , it has greatly declined in numbers since the beginning of the twentieth century .
Today , it is in danger of extinction and has disappeared from most European rivers .
In France , it can still be observed in the Gironde estuary , near Bordeaux .
There has been a ban on the fishing of sturgeon since 1982 .
Research got under way in the late 1970s , and there is an ongoing restoration plan in France .
In order to implement this plan properly , it is essential to know what the original ( native ) species are .
Until now , only the European sturgeon ( Acipenser sturio ) has been listed in France .
However , other species may have been present in the past but no longer be present today .
In order to identify them , scientists particularly make use of inventories , historical documents and museum collections .
However , such sources of information are not always reliable .
With regard to species that are no longer present , remains dug up from archaeological excavations represent the most reliable factual data .
It is for this reason that Desse - Berset , an archeozoologist at CNRS , specialized in the morphological study of remains of sturgeons .
She studied remains from several archeological sites , in particular on the French Atlantic coast ( Oléron Island , Gironde estuary , Vendée ) .
She compared them with skeletons in her reference collection , which includes not only European sturgeons from the Gironde estuary , but also Atlantic sturgeons caught in Canada .
Her conclusion is unequivocal : a second species of sturgeon , the Atlantic sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrinchus ) , is attested to on the French Atlantic coast at several periods , from prehistoric times until the second century AD .
More specifically , Oléron Island and the Gironde estuary were home to two species of sturgeon at the end of the Neolithic , 5 000 years ago : the Atlantic sturgeon and the European sturgeon .
These species co-existed in France for at least 3 000 years .
This is the first time that the presence of another species of sturgeon in France has been demonstrated .
No longer present in France today , this species is currently found along the Atlantic coast of North America .
This discovery provides information of major importance for sturgeon restoration projects in France .
It also raises many questions about the history of sturgeon populations .
These new results are the starting point for archeozoological research by Desse - Berset all over France .
In addition , paleoecological and paleogenetic ( mitochondrial and nuclear DNA ) studies will be carried out in order to provide information about the genetic diversity of these recently extinct populations .

Troubled home loans continued to mount in the nation ’s banks in the third quarter as even once - solid borrowers increasingly fell behind on their mortgage payments .
For the first quarter ever , the number of homes in foreclosure with mortgages serviced by U.S. national banks and savings and loans topped the 1 - million mark , according to figures released Monday by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
The percentage of prime borrowers whose loans were 60 or more days past due doubled from the July - to - September period a year earlier .
And more than half of all homeowners whose payments had been lowered through modification plans defaulted again .
The report , which covers about 34 million loans , or about 65 % of all U.S. mortgages , underscores the obstacles to strengthening the nation ’s rickety housing market .
Stubborn unemployment is making it tough for millions of homeowners to pay their debts .
In addition , many people whose monthly installments have been lowered still are unable to keep up with their payments .

Of the mortgages serviced by national banks and thrifts , only 87.2 % were current and performing .
It was the sixth straight quarter that the quality of those home loan portfolios had slipped .
“ Mortgage performance continued to decline as a result of continuing adverse economic conditions including rising unemployment and loss in home values , ” the report said .
Seriously delinquent mortgages -- loans 60 or more days past due and loans to delinquent borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy -- rose to 6.2 % of the servicing portfolio .
That ’s a 16.7 % increase over the second quarter and a 73.8 % increase from a year earlier , the report said .
Of those seriously delinquent loans , the number of homes in the foreclosure process reached 1.09 million , about 3.2 % of all the loans surveyed .

The report highlighted some troubling trends as the housing market continues to struggle despite increasing sales and prices in many areas .
Difficulties increased for holders of prime mortgages , with the percentage of those loans that were 60 days or more past due increasing to 3.2 % , up almost 20 % from the second quarter and more than double the rate of a year earlier .
In addition , holders of mortgages whose payments had been lowered through government or private modification plans re-defaulted at high rates .
More than half of all homeowners with modified loans fell 60 days or more behind in their payments within six months of the modification taking place .
But Bruce Krueger , a mortgage analyst for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , noted that homeowners with more - recent modifications were doing better at keeping up with their new payments , reflecting a push by the Obama administration to get mortgage servicers to come up with better plans .
About 35 % of homeowners who received modifications in the third quarter of 2008 fell 60 days or more behind on their payments within three months of the modification , the report said .
That figure decreased to about 19 % of homeowners who received a modification in the second quarter of this year .

Still , the report ’s data could add pressure on Congress to give financially strapped homeowners additional help by allowing judges to lower mortgage principle as part of bankruptcy , said Jaret Seiberg , a financial policy analyst with Concept Capital ’s Washington Research Group .
“ While the re-default rate seems to be getting better , it ’s still very high and it ’s high enough to continue causing a political problem for the industry , ” he said .
Mortgage modifications increased in the third quarter as the Obama administration pushed servicers to participate in its Making Home Affordable modification program .
The report said servicers modified 680,000 loans through that program or their own efforts .
Overall , mortgage servicers started almost twice as many modifications as new foreclosures .
Oddly , the increased attempt to keep people in their homes with lower payments contributed to the rise in the number of homes in the foreclosure process .
The pace of homes beginning foreclosure proceedings remained about the same in the third quarter as it was earlier this year .
But fewer of those proceedings were finished , as mortgage servicers worked with homeowners to modify some of those loans .

Monday ’s report comes on the heels of a private report last week that said there were 1.7 million homes headed for the market because of foreclosures or delinquency .
That backlog of “ shadow inventory ” increased 55 % in the year that ended Sept. 30 , said the report by First American CoreLogic , a Santa Ana research firm .
The Obama administration has been trying to reduce foreclosures through its mortgage modification program , but reported this month that few of the three - month trial modifications were being made permanent .
Of the more than 700,000 trial modifications offered by mortgage servicers , just 31,382 had been made permanent as of Nov. 30 .
Administration officials have increased pressure on mortgage servicers to improve that figure .

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , nominated for a second term by President Obama in August , faces a confirmation hearing Thursday .
Quick Vote Should Ben Bernanke be confirmed for a second term as Fed chair ?
Yes
No or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , just days ahead of his confirmation hearing , is warning Congress that actions limiting the central bank 's independence could prove detrimental to the causes of financial reform and economic recovery .
In an op - ed piece to be published in Sunday 's Washington Post , Bernanke criticizes two moves aimed at limiting the Fed -- a proposal in the Senate to strip the central bank of its bank regulatory powers and a House Financial Services Committee vote to audit monetary policy deliberations and actions .
" These measures are very much out of step with the global consensus on the appropriate role of central banks , and they would seriously impair the prospects for economic and financial stability in the United States , " Bernanke wrote .
Bernanke says the congressional moves are a byproduct of the public frustration over the financial crisis and the government 's response , especially the bailout of large banks .
( Fed rage boils on Capitol Hill )
" The government 's actions to avoid financial collapse last fall -- as distasteful and unfair as some undoubtedly were -- were unfortunately necessary to prevent a global economic catastrophe that could have rivaled the Great Depression in length and severity , with profound consequences for our economy and society , " he wrote .
But the Fed chairman says that , while reforms are needed , " we should be seeking to preserve , not degrade , the institution 's ability to foster financial stability and to promote economic recovery without inflation . "
Among the ideas he supports is development of a special bankruptcy procedure for firms " whose disorderly failure would threaten the integrity of the financial system -- to ensure that ad hoc interventions of the type we were forced to use last fall never happen again . "
Bernanke 's column comes ahead of a Senate Banking Committee hearing , scheduled for Thursday , considering his nomination for a second term as Fed chairman .
President Obama announced the nomination in August .
The last sentence of his commentary is likely to be the theme he and his supporters will stress during the hearing .
" Now more than ever , America needs a strong , nonpolitical and independent central bank with the tools to promote financial stability and to help steer our economy to recovery without inflation , " Bernanke wrote .
Calculating the Date of Easter
Book of Common Prayer
We refer to the year number as y , and use it to calculate the Golden number , g :
g = y mod 19 + 1
s = ( y - 1600 ) div 100 - ( y - 1600 ) div 400
l = ( ( (y - 1400 ) div 100 ) × 8 ) div 25
p' = ( 3 - 11g + s - l ) mod 30
if ( p ' == 29 ) or ( p ' == 28 and g > 11 ) then
p = p ' - 1
else
p = p '
d = (y + ( y div 4 ) - ( y div 100 ) + ( y div 400 ) ) mod 7
d' = ( 8 - d ) mod 7
p '' = ( 80 + p ) mod 7 = ( 3 + p ) mod 7
x ' = d' - p '' = ( 8 - d ) mod 7 - ( 3 + p ) mod 7 = ( 8 - d - ( 3 + p ) ) mod 7 = ( 5 - d - p ) ) mod 7
x = ( x ' - 1 ) mod 7 + 1 = ( 4 - d - p ) ) mod 7 + 1
We can now calculate e , the number of days Easter falls after 21st March :
e = p + x
e = p + 1 + ( 4 - d - p ) mod 7
if e < 11 then
( e + 21 ) March
else
( e - 10 ) April
Mordechai Vanunu , who served 18 years in prison after he revealed Israel 's secret nuclear programme , has been placed under house arrest pending criminal charges for allegedly breaching the terms of his 2004 release , which includes a ban on contacts with foreigners .
A police spokesman , Micky Rosenfeld , said Vanunu was accused of meeting with " a number of foreigners " .
The spokesman , however , did not specify who the foreigners were or where they came from .
Vanunu 's lawyer , Avigdor Feldman , said his client had been arrested because his romantic attachment to an unnamed Norwegian woman had come to the attention of the authorities .
" Vanunu was arrested [ for ] a relationship between a man and a woman , with a Norwegian citizen , " he told Reuters .
" He is not being accused of giving any secrets .
She is not interested in nuclear business – she 's interested in Mordechai Vanunu [ and he ] is probably interested in her . "
The woman has reportedly been interrogated by police but has not been charged with any offence .
Vanunu has fallen foul of the no-foreigners rule before .
In 2007 , he was sentenced to six months in jail for talking to non-Israelis .
Vanunu , a former technician at Israel 's Dimona nuclear plant , was first jailed in 1986 after he passed on information about Israel 's nuclear programme to the Sunday Times .
The Israeli authorities argue that he may have kept back some information which could still be of use to a hostile foreign power .
His dilemma is compounded by the fact that most Israelis do not approve of his actions and want no contact with him .
Vanunu says the feeling is mutual and he would prefer to live abroad , but is banned from doing so .
Israel 's supreme court has upheld the restrictions on his freedom of association and movement despite criticism by international human rights groups .
Speaking in court today , Vanunu – who refuses to speak Hebrew publicly in protest at his treatment – said : " This Jewish state has 200 atomic ... hydrogen bombs , atomic weapons , neutron bomb .
They are not able to say they have the bomb , they are not able to destroy anyone ... instead they arrest Vanunu . "
After talking to the Sunday Times , Vanunu was tracked down in Rome where he was kidnapped by Israeli intelligence agents and brought back to Israel to stand trial .
Israel has never publicly acknowledged its nuclear weapons arsenal .
I ’m impressed with Windows 7 .
After running the beta for months it is everything Windows should be .
Sure there are niggles – but that would be true of any alternative .
I was so impressed I decided to buy the operating system .
Imagine my surprise when I discovered Dick Smith lists the Windows 7 Ultimate and Professional upgrades at $ 499 each .
The price is ridiculous .
The same Dick Smith has notebook computers with Windows installed starting at $ 899 .
That ’s notebook not netbook .
OK .
I understand the $ 899 notebook might not ship with Windows 7 Professional .
That ’s not the point .
For just $ 400 more than the cost of a software upgrade I can have a new computer .
The cheapest netbook on sale in New Zealand is $ 425 – just $ 25 more than the upgrade to Windows Professional .
At Digital Shop I can buy a desktop for just $ 487.64 with Windows 7 Professional installed .
That ’s right .
In effect I can pay just $ 87.64 for a new computer .
So here are my choices :
Buy a new PC with Windows 7 Professional .
Throw my existing , perfectly serviceable machine into a landfill .
Have a better computer experience but stop sleeping at night because I ’m destroying the planet .
Revert to Vista or XP .
This costs nothing – but will give me a more annoying computer experience than at present .
Look once again at Linux .
What would you do ?

Fans of the six - time Emmy Award winning Fox series Arrested Development have been begging for a feature film starring the Bluth family since the critically acclaimed show was suddenly canceled after only three seasons in 2006 .
In early 2008 the show 's star Jason Bateman and series creator Mitchell Hurwitz stated that they were moving forward with Arrested Development the movie and that the series ' executive producer / narrator Ron Howard might even direct .
With Hurwitz writing the script and supposedly the entire cast wanting to reprise their roles Bateman announced in July of last year that the film was happening and that it would be in theaters in about a year and a half .
However , in contradiction to that , comedian David Cross who portrayed Dr. Tobias Funke on the show stated publicly last September that he did n't know anything about a script and that he had n't heard anything about the film .
We had the opportunity to speak with actor / comedian Will Arnett , who played the oldest Bluth sibling Gob on the show , over the weekend while he was promoting his new film When in Rome , opening in theaters on January 29th .
With Arrested Development the movie seemingly up in the air , we asked the actor specifically about the film adaptation of the series and when that might begin production ?
" What is that ?
I 've never heard of that .
I have no idea what you are talking about , " the actor replied jokingly .
" No , we 're real close , " Arnett confirmed .
" We 're just finalizing the script and should begin shooting it this year , " he concluded .
The actor went on to say that he was looking forward to returning to the role of Gob and reuniting with his fellow cast mates , all of who have stayed very close according to the actor .
He went on to mention that he is currently working on a new TV project for the UK's Channel Four with David Cross and has recently started a new digital production company called DumbDumb with co-star and friend Jason Bateman .
So Arrested Development fans can rest a little easier tonight knowing that Michael , Gob and the rest of the loveable Bluth family members will be coming soon to a theater near you !
Arnett can next be seen in the romantic comedy When in Rome also starring Kirsten Bell and Josh Duhamel , which opens in theaters on January 29th .
Please check back with us in a few weeks for our exclusive interview with Will Arnett and the rest of the cast of the new film .

It ’s really time I started writing more about the country I live in , the country of my birth , the UK , a country that has the oldest , the most cunning , the most duplicitous ( not to mention the most mendacious ) of all ruling classes .
After all , they ’ve been at it for five hundred years , finally being forced to come up with what they like to call parliamentary democracy over a century ago , but just how democratic is it ?
And can we really expect real change to come about through a system as corrupt and sclerotic as ‘ parliamentary democracy ’ ?
Parliamentary democracy is a closed system , literally owned by the two main political parties who work in intimate cooperation with the state bureaucracy to maintain the status quo .
For proof of this we need only look at the panic caused by the ‘ expenses ’ scandal and how the political class , fearful of any challenge to its hegemony has fought tool and nail , left and right to defend their privilege to spend our money as they please .
How they have managed to do this should be important to us and especially the confidence trick called Parliament .
It is a system that has , for around a century , played the central role in the preservation of capitalism , in reality a private game with the political class being the players , the judges and the rule makers .
In other words , a fix and a fix carried out , no less , with the complicity of organized labour .
We , the public , play our part by voting ( or not ) to maintain the ‘ game ’ , getting bounced back and forth between two sides of same coin .
But clearly the ‘ game ’ would seem to have run its course which , with all the talk of the state ’s ‘ lack of legitimacy ’ , is reflected in the falling number of those who bother to vote or take part in any kind of political activity .
Even the Labour Party ’s own membership has dwindled to a fraction of its size since ‘ New ’ Labour came to power ( before coming to power in 1997 the Labour Party had over half a million members ) .
The worst thing about this scenario is that , aside from the Anarchists , the left has attempted to join in the ‘ game ’ for the past century and more , with predictable results .
We only need to look at the ‘ left ’ in Parliament to see the truth , for no matter how left they are outside of Parliament , inside , they too have to play the ‘ game ’ , effectively emasculating themselves in the process .
If they do n’t , the results are predictable , for example , when George Galloway spoke out about the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 , he was very quickly ejected from the ‘ game ’ .
Just how seductive the ‘ game ’ is can be illustrated by Galloway ’s claim , via the Respect Party , that part of Respect ’s objective was to restore the Labour Party to its former , pre-Blairite reformist glory .
The exclusion of the real left from the political process by the Labour Party and its complicit trade unions goes back decades , illustrated by the endless disbanding and reforming of the Labour Party Young Socialists every time it moved to the real left .
Also , the fact that under the Labour Party ’s ‘ bans and proscriptions ’ , all attempts by the left within the Labour Party to seek common cause ( and vice versa ) with real progressives meant certain expulsion from the Party .
True to its Cold War legacy Red-baiting was and remains Labour ’s methodology .
The trade unions are in the same fix , having handed over their power to the ‘ party of labour ’ long ago .
Interestingly , William Morris ’s ‘ News From Nowhere ’ predicted this outcome in 1895 after the path of attempting to ‘ reform ’ capitalism won the day .
The end result is plain to see : a disenfranchised and alienated population , and with only a fraction of the workforce in trade unions ( in the 1950s around 50 % were unionized ) , most do n’t even get a look - see into the ‘ game ’ unless some scandal is exposed .
Add to this a corrupt , incompetent and murderous political class , revealed in all its sordid details over the twelve years of Labour rule .
Is it any wonder that the state ‘ lacks legitimacy ’ ?
So what ’s the reason for this pathetic state of affairs ?
In a word : reformism , the idea that capitalism can be ‘ reformed ’ to more resemble socialism ( capitalism with a human face ? ) , a process that reached its zenith with the post - war Labour government and even then the nationalization of key sectors of the economy came about firstly because British capitalism was bankrupt .
Secondly , it was under pressure from a working class who did not want to see a return to a reactionary and backward pre-war Britain .
Things had to change but , how much ?
And , what kind of change ?
The post - war Labour government was elected on a wave of progressive ideas following the defeat of Fascism : the National Health Service ( the Tories realizing that a complicit population was essential to the survival of capitalism , had already created a new standardized national ‘ education ’ system ) , transport and energy were nationalized , a massive house building programme was initiated , Keynesian capitalism was born ( even in the early 1960s many British homes had neither an indoor toilet or even a proper bathroom , let alone adequate heating ) .
So all the while the Labour Party ( and successive Labour governments ) were proclaiming socialism , in reality they were , not only , propping up domestic capitalism , worse still , their foreign policy was avowedly anti-communist and imperialist / colonialist !
So those on the left who claim that ‘ New ’ Labour has somehow strayed from the path of righteousness need to brush up on their history .
Britain ’s African , Asian , Latin American and Caribbean colonies got the same treatment from Labour as they did from the Tories ; the same , racist and imperialist policies were enacted ( if ever there was proof of just how the ideology of racism works when utilized by the state this is it ) and nothing has changed eg , Iraq , Afghanistan , Iran , China , Russia , in fact any country that does n’t buy into Western ‘ democracy ’ gets the ‘ treatment ’ .
This is the terrible trajectory of reformism .
It explains in part at least , why the left is so marginalized in British political life by what is , in effect , an unholy alliance between organized labour and its alleged voice , the Labour Party and their master , Capital .
But how to break this impasse ?
Over the past one hundred - plus years the British left has ‘ evolved ’ as an integral ( if ineffectual ) component of the reformist model with organized labour , led by a revolutionary party , viewed as the main vehicle for bringing about an end to capitalism through the ballot , a policy that obviously has not worked .
Instead , the trade unions became an elitist battleground between left and right with corrupt practices on both sides .
The ‘ rank and file ’ membership were relegated to mere onlookers whilst the labour elite slugged it out , with the left inevitably losing .
The end of the industrial working class
The end of the Keynesian model of capitalism in the 1970s with the birth of so - called neo-liberalism should surely have been a wake - up call for the left .
Instead , it retreated in disarray , eventually fragmenting into small pieces , especially after the destruction of the largest and most powerful of unions , the miners by the Thatcher government ( the opening shot in the deindustrialization of the UK ) .
Instead we have witnessed the same entrenched left ‘ leadership ’ pushing the same failed reformist policies , the ‘ parliamentary road to socialism ’ as the British Communist Party called it .
The central question for the left is : what is to replace organized industrial labour , after all was n’t it organized labour that was to lead the revolution ?
In order to try and answer this question , we need to recognize that , whilst capitalism has transformed itself , largely by exporting manufacturing to our former colonies and , in the process , destroying the organized industrial working class , the left simply has n’t got it .
Instead , it insists on fighting a battle long lost and with ‘ tools ’ that no longer exist .
What used to be the organized industrial working class is now a shadow of its former self , worse still the creation of a so - called service - based economy , composed largely of non-union labour , much of it part - time .
It is fragmented and lacks voice .
It ’s here that the trade union movement reveals its real nature : where are the campaigns to unionize the unorganized if only to strengthen the power of the central union bureaucracy , the TUC ?.
The only potential rising force in society , the so - called middle class , is barely even recognized as being a part of the working class by the left ( we really need to question the use of the term middle class ) .
Yet the economy is now managed by the ‘ middle class ’ , a situation the ruling elite are only too aware of .
The state is the single biggest employer and not coincidentally .
The biggest unions are all mostly public employee unions , but these unions are split along ‘ middle ’- working class lines .
In the private sector , with ascendancy of the financial services sector , marketing and distribution , especially of ‘ virtual ’ products , the capitalist economy is now in the hands of the managers and technicians , the so - called middle class .
Just look at the chaos unleashed by paying young university whizz kids to play with the numbers in the futures markets , it ’s all a big game to them .
Britain is once more a Merchant ’s economy with ‘ wealth ’ being generated , not by the production of real and useful products and services , but by manipulating numbers on a gigantic , global scale and doing all of it in real time .
The amount of money in private hands dwarfs the amount that the state messes about with as the UK ’s £ 20 billion public debt .
The US ’s now ( officially ) $ 1.3 trillion debt demonstrates , after all , the state borrows it from the private sector ( after the banks et al have ripped off their profits they get by charging interest on the money printed by the state that they then lend out to customers ) .
It ’s a marvellous system , ingenious even , but utterly irrational , designed to do only one thing , produce a profit for the shareholders in the shortest possible time .
This is the setting , so for example , truly revolutionary trade unions would be demanding that running financial services like this is irrational , immoral , unstable and destructive , in other words , against the public ’s interest .
So here ’s an alternative way of managing the economy , if for no other reason than to protect the interests of its members .
But , for as long as the trade unions are in bed with the political class , such outcomes are just fantasies .
Instead , we get the following collaboration between the union hierarchy and the government !
“ BBC Newsnight on Thursday revealed a leaked confidential document spilling the beans on a Royal Mail plan to impose cuts , provoke a strike and smash the union .
This blows a hole in their spin over the past couple of weeks about an uncooperative union ! /…/
“ The embarrassing bit was when the Newsnight presenter repeatedly asked Billy [ Hayes , postal workers ’ union ] how he felt about the CWU giving £ 7 million since 2001 to Labour to have it plotting against it , and did he support the 98 % of London postal workers who had voted to break from Labour ?
Labour - lovin’
Billy ducked it several times before lamely saying the party was n’t the same as the government . ” —
“ Royal Mail secret plot with ‘ the Shareholder ’ ”
How can a trade union represent the interests of its members when its leadership are funding the very government that ’s trying to destroy it ?
This is the insane end - product of reformism , where workers fund a government via their trade unions that is a wholy owned subsidiary of capital .
Judith Warner on the politics of everyday life .
The health care reform bill currently being debated in the Senate contains a provision known as the Bo - Tax — so called because it would levy a 5 percent tax on cosmetic surgery procedures .
The idea is to tax those who indulge in medically unnecessary procedures in order to pay for medical necessities for everyone else .
This sounded like a refreshingly good idea to me , until I read that Terry O’Neill , the president of the National Organization for Women , is against it .
“ Now they are going to put a tax on middle - aged women in a society that devalues them for being middle - aged ? ” she complained to The Times .
Could this possibly be the voice of NOW , the country ’s premier women ’s rights group ? , I wondered .
Could this be the same feminist movement that in 1968 filled a “ Freedom Trash Can ” outside the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City with bras , girdles and false eyelashes to protest the “ ludicrous ‘ beauty ’ standards we ourselves are conditioned to take seriously , ” as Robin Morgan , an organizer of the protest , put it at the time ?
Yes , standing up for the rights of middle - aged women to have access to cosmetic enhancement is part of the work of contemporary feminism , O’Neill told me this week .
It ’s the sorry consequence of a number of sorrier truths :
The economy is terrible .
Middle - aged women , many of whom reduced their working hours , limiting their earning power and ambition , when they had kids or , later , found themselves having to care for their parents , are in a particularly vulnerable spot these days , as they ’re increasingly called upon to supplement or take over the lion ’s share of family money - making .
And any number of studies have shown that people with better ( read : younger ) looks have a better chance of getting a good job .
Particularly women .
“ I am 57 years old .
I really sympathize with women who are out of the job market , wondering , will anyone even take me seriously ? ” O’Neill explained .
“ The women ’s movement is not overly concerned with the more superficial aspect of clothing or beauty or fashion trends .
The more important question is whether we are participating fully in the lives of our communities .
And middle - aged women really are n’t .
I know a lot of women whose earning power stalled out or kicked down as they entered into their 50s , unlike their male counterparts ’ , whose really went up . ”
And now a lot of men are out of work .
Which means that , in this economy , getting the old face and belly looking tighter may , for many middle - aged women , be as crucial as having an eye - catching résumé .
“ I ’ve met women who ’ve had to lie their ages down as much as 20 years to get or keep jobs as everything from waitresses to high - level consultants , ” Gloria Steinem , who herself had cosmetic eye surgery some decades ago , told me this week .
“ They gave up pensions and benefits because they could n’t produce documents , and employers colluded because they saved money . ”
How disfiguring it can be when reality bites .
We are constantly hearing about the different phases , themes , lives and deaths of feminism .
First wave , second wave , “ victim , ” “ raunch , ” etc .
“ Looks are the new feminism , an activism of aesthetics , ” Alex Kuczynski wrote in the introduction to her 2006 book on America ’s obsession with cosmetic surgery , “ Beauty Junkies . ”
At first glance , this seems ridiculous .
And yet it says something true enough about the way many younger women understand feminism at a time when organized , real - world activism has hit wall after wall of political impossibility .
Sneaker ads teach that feminism is all about taking control — of your figure .
This is what happens when equal pay stalls , abortion rights wither , and attempts to improve child care and workplace flexibility die on the legislative vine year after year .
Women ’s empowerment becomes a matter of a tight face and a flat belly .
You control what you can control .
And so many middle - aged women feel particularly out of control now , as indeed they are , in these life plan - wrecking economic times .
“ Bag - lady syndrome , ” the fear many women have that their financial security will disappear in a heartbeat , leading them to live out their remaining years on the streets , is shockingly pervasive .
In 2006 , before the current economic crisis hit , 90 percent of women surveyed by a Minnesota life insurance company said they felt financially insecure ; 46 percent of those women overall said they had a “ tremendous fear of becoming a bag lady , ” including 48 percent of those with an annual income of more than $ 100,000 .
These days , more women than men — following a recession in which the men , overwhelmingly , lost the jobs — report being significantly stressed about money .
The inner bag lady , wrinkle - faced and unkempt , is no joke .
She ’s the worst - case scenario future .
And while it ’s easy to point to her as an irrational creation of women ’s overly self - doubting imaginations ( how else to explain the fact that wealthy , successful women like Katie Couric , Lily Tomlin and Steinem herself have all admitted to carrying around the fear — long after it was even remotely rational — of finding themselves one day , in old age , out on the streets ? ) , she points to something very real : women ’s economic status in this country is not what it should be .
Middle - aged women with families should n’t be so scared .
I wonder if we have n’t entered into a period of what should be called “ adjustment ” feminism .
The women ’s movement is having to adjust to the realities of life in our culture , where many of its basic goals — including the very basic liberation of women from their pop culture status as a “ mindless - boob - girlie symbol , ” to borrow a phrase again from Robin Morgan — have stalled or are even backsliding .
This week , for example , not only brought a public statement by the head of NOW acknowledging that the fight to have women valued for their inner beauty is essentially a wash ; it also found NOW in the very bizarre position of urging senators to preserve the dictates of the Hyde Amendment , which for over 30 years has guaranteed that Medicaid funds would not be used to pay for most abortions for poor women .
The House of Representatives ’ recently - passed the Stupak amendment , which effectively prohibits both private health insurance plans participating in the future - envisioned insurance “ exchange ” and whatever public option may come into being , from offering abortion coverage to any woman , and the Stupak - like proposals currently circulating in the Senate are so much worse , after all .
Hyde suddenly seems bearable .
Or maybe we should talk about having entered into the middle age of feminism — a moment when stock is taken , dreams are deferred and real life is faced in all its ugliness .
Because to do otherwise is no longer youthfully idealistic , just foolhardy .
Because you ’ve got to hold onto what you ’ve got , consolidate your gains and avoid potentially disastrous future losses .
With so much male unemployment , so much underemployment , so many people “ lucky ” to have jobs with reduced hours and benefits , women need good work options like never before .
We need flexibility with security , options that will let us build wealth while taking sufficient care of our families .
Barring this , I guess we ’ll go for eye lifts and Botox .

The waste is processed and made into blocks which are burned
A water firm says it saved £ 15 m last year - by using human waste to make electricity .
In 2008/09 , Thames Water generated 14 % of its power from either burning sludge or methane derived from the 2.8 billion litres of sewage it treats every day .
The company hopes the move will ultimately help it cut greenhouse gases by 20 % .
More than 13 million people in London , Berkshire , Oxfordshire , Hertfordshire and Surrey are served by Thames Water .
Dr Keith Colquhoun , Thames
Water 's climate change strategy manager , said : " There 's no polite way of saying this but what we produce - our poo - is n't simply waste , it 's a great source of energy .
" The solids in sewage have a high calorific content that we use to generate electricity .
" This is n't a gimmick .
As well as helping us to be more sustainable as a company , it also saves money - £ 15 m less of customers ' cash spent on National Grid energy last year alone , which ultimately has a downward pressure of bills .
" Our goal is to cut greenhouse emissions by 20 % on 1990 levels by 2020 - that 's about 200,000 tonnes less CO2 .
" By using poo power and other renewable energy sources , we 're making significant progress towards this target . "
The New York Times ran an interesting article about Roger Ailes a couple of days ago .
Ailes is the head of Fox News at News Corporation , owned and run , of course , by Rupert Murdoch and various offspring Murdochs .
Ailes is one of the most important people in the United States , by virtue of his re-creation of the concept of television news , morphing from something that vaguely resembled news into something that is indistinguishable from right - wing propaganda .
And it has had enormous impact on television news in general , and on US political , and broader , culture , as anyone who has seen Outfoxed knows .
It turns out that not everyone in the Murdoch family is happy with Mr Ailes .
There are a number of possible reasons .
First , he ’s really , really important to News Corporation :
Mr. Ailes is certainly making money .
At a time when the broadcast networks are struggling with diminishing audiences and profits in news , he has built Fox News into the profit engine of the News Corporation .
Fox News is believed to make more money than CNN , MSNBC and the evening newscasts of NBC , ABC and CBS combined .
The division is on track to achieve $ 700 million in operating profit this year , according to analyst estimates that Mr. Ailes does not dispute .
This outsize success has placed Mr. Ailes , an aggressive former Republican political strategist , at the pinnacle of power in three corridors of American life : business , media and politics .
In addition to being the best - paid person in the News Corporation last year , he is the most successful news executive of the last 10 years , and his network exerts a strong influence on the fractured conservative movement .
And it ’s that second paragraph that really conveys Ailes ’ seminal importance to modern American politics over the past two decades .
For Ailes basically created the modern media mindset that made conservative talking points the de facto standard for television reality .
This would include the misrepresentations , sleazy innuendo , and outright lying that now defines modern broadcast news .
It was always there , of course , but never in the abundance it is now , and to for that we owe Mr. Ailes a bow .
The Times ‘ piece is basically a puff piece on Ailes ’ importance to News Corporation and modern conservatism , which may be more or less the same thing , and how he seems to have old Rupert pretty much completely cowed .
But not everyone seems to be happy with that .
The Times has some negative comments from Matthew Freud , Murdoch ’s son- in - law , which get elaborated on in Roy Greenslade ’s blog over at The Guardian :
Matthew Freud has launched a withering attack on the head of Fox News , a controversial US TV channel owned by his father - in - law , Rupert Murdoch .
Freud told the New York Times he was “ ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes ’s horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that News Corporation , its founder and every other global media business aspires to ” .
Freud , who is married to Elisabeth , Murdoch ’s second daughter , was speaking to the paper for a profile of Ailes and prefaced his coment by saying he was “ by no means alone within the family or the company ” in holding such hostile views of Fox News .
According to the Financial Times , Murdoch ’s News Corporation later issued a statement saying : “ Matthew Freud ’s opinions are his own and in no way reflect the views of Rupert Murdoch , who is proud of Roger Ailes and Fox News . ”
Freud , head of his eponymous public relations company , is not the kind of man to speak carelessly to a journalist , so he clearly wanted to put his views on the record .
Murdoch ’s family , and its various entanglements with each other and with Murdoch himself , are pretty much a matter of public record , given Murdoch ’s prominence and the extent to which has has attempted to drag his children into the running of his empire .
For many of them , though , there has been greater appeal outside of their fathers ’ orbit .
Michael Wolf , who wrote a recent biography of Murdoch ( The Man Who Owns the News ) , provided a nice summary of the family last November to The Guardian .
So what next ?
Is there a palace revolt brewing ?
Murdoch himself is 79 , and his principal deputy , Peter Chernin , departed not too long ago — - which leaves Ailes as the most senior and powerful executive in the corporation after Murdoch .
But if there is significant family opposition to Ailes , and they ’re the ones who own the stock , one has to question how much longer Ailes would remain in his post on Rupert ’s departure .
Which would be no bad thing for the rest of us .
Long before the word globalisation entered the language of the media in the Eighties , a group of scholars had been insisting on a holistic treatment of politics , economics and history .
The class , the nation , the state or the economy — each of these was too narrow , the wrong unit of analysis , they insisted .
It all had to be looked at as part of a world system , extensive and interlinked .
Globalisation .
Immanuel Wallerstein has taken Marxism as the base for his theoretical superstructure .
He began his career by studying the political economy of West African states in the early Sixties , meeting Frantz Fanon along the way and writing a defence of the heterodox theorist in the face of scepticism from traditional leftists .
By 1974 Wallerstein published the first of a trilogy , titled The Modern World - System , vol .
I : Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World - Economy in the Sixteenth Century .
He has since added two more volumes to the series which , with scores of further books , make for an intimidating oeuvre .
A professor of sociology at a string of universities , including Binghamton and Yale , Wallerstein , not quite retired , delivered two speeches at Wits and the University of Johannesburg recently , outlining the past and present of capitalism and predicting a dire future for humans all over the globe .
Born in New York City 79 years ago , his air of authority drew deference from local luminaries , with prominent academics and activists posing serious questions to a scholar who has been exploring his field since the early Fifties .
Wallerstein was president of the International Sociological Association between 1994 and 1998 and , until 2005 , head of the Paris - based Fernand Braudel Centre for the Study of Economies , Historical Systems and Civilizations , a school that from its inception looked at la longue durée , against the short - termism of much social science .
Wallerstein sees the period from 1945 to 1970 as having gone through the largest economic expansion in history .
He says we are still enmeshed in the downturn that followed and we are unlikely to emerge until an entirely new form of social organisation takes the place of capitalism , a process likely to take 50 or so more years .
Capitalist cycles recur because two factors underpin the system : a ­process of monopolisation , which facilitates super - profits , and a hegemonic process that secures the conditions for monopolisation .
But both of these are cyclical and under certain conditions they fall apart : the entry of new producers brings more competition and breaks up the monopoly , while , more slowly , world orders dissolve when other superpowers emerge .
Wallerstein says the world was profoundly transformed by the events of 1968 .
Revolts in major cities of the world as well as in more peripheral locations were all connected , a series of apparently local happenings all produced by a major structural shift in world capitalism between 1966 and 1970 .
One of the first signs of this came in 1967 when the dollar underwent a crisis from which it has never quite emerged .
Wallerstein presents several theses with regard to 1968 : that it was a revolution against US hegemony ; that the “ more passionate ” protests were directed against the “ old left ” .
The counterculture , he avers , was a product of revolutionary euphoria , secondary to the main event , its high point being Woodstock .
It had a long history , 200 years to be precise , and , believe it or not , even in post - 1917 Russia free love was to be had .
May 1968 in Paris was the scene of the most brazen confrontation between the old and the new left , the authority of the former effectively dissolved .
Communist parties and national liberation movements lost their pre-eminence .
The assumptions of 150 years of radical thought were overthrown : the central one being that capturing the state could be the basis for the transformation of society .
In the developing world it was Mexico that experienced some of the most intense protests , a country where the oldest national liberation movement had been in power since its revolution in 1910 .
For Wallerstein , everything works in cycles ; hegemonies also alternate .
Modern capitalism has had only three hegemonic powers : the United Provinces established their world order in the mid-17th ­century , the United Kingdom in mid-19th ­century and the United States in the mid-20th century .
And for a decade now the professor has been saying that US hegemony is on the way out .
Once secured as top dog , the ­hegemonic state “ is able to set the rules by which the interstate system operates ” .
Today , he says , capitalism has reached a stage so depleted that not even capitalists defend the system .
Costs of every factor of production have risen so steeply , amid a period in which all the traditional methods of replenishing the system have been exhausted , that capital will one day cease to yield returns .
His argument is complex .
Three major costs are incurred in production : personnel , material inputs and taxation .
Each of these has become more expensive .
When unskilled labour becomes too expensive , capital relocates .
But there are fewer and fewer places to which to relocate .
When relocation takes place , it is , initially , a win - win situation for both capital and labour .
But labour soon realises that it is being exploited and agitates for higher wages .
Inputs have become more expensive also .
When costs rise , the problem for the capitalist is to find ways of not paying the bill .
If factories produced waste , this was a cost passed on to the state .
But environmental imperatives see states demand that capital bears the costs of “ collateral damage ” .
State taxes and private taxes have gone up .
Businesses have to pay their local mafiosi and corrupt officials continue to extract their pounds of flesh , the weight of which increases as the cost of living pushes up .
And governments have to bear the costs of increasing demands for education , health and pensions .
Turning to possible alternatives to capitalism , Wallerstein says the current depression will “ continue now for quite some time and go quite deep ” .
Governments will print money and seek to avert uprisings of workers and middle classes whose pensions evaporate .
We are headed for gridlock .
Ever wilder fluctuations will make short - term predictions impossible .
And when equilibrium is so remote , small events are likely to have a greater effect on the whole than they would under equilibrium .
So interventions by activists are more likely today to give birth to the new than during periods of stability .
Wallerstein contrasts two camps of reformers , the harbingers of the new system : those who want something new , more egalitarian and less hierarchical and those who want to salvage the system .
But each of these camps is itself divided in two , so the conflict is fourfold .
In the ruling Davos camp there are those who want a return to an inegalitarian , hierarchical system , like Dick Cheney , opposed by meritocrats who want to secure the road to privilege using persuasion and a minimum of force , promising a multicultural , green utopia .
The resisters , the Porto Alegre camp , are divided into egalitarians and vanguardists , the latter believing that some see more clearly than others and arguing for a merely formal egalitarianism .
So the battle between the two camps rages as the battle within each camp continues .
Wallerstein says it is impossible to set out specific proposals for a kinder world , but he “ does not sniff ” at more traditional forms of struggles .
Winning elections is still important , as is securing judicial rights and survival plans .
But these will not bring us closer to a new systemic alternative .
The construction of decommodified modes of production would go some way towards developing real alternatives to our problems .
And he prescribes endless intellectual and moral debate , sharpening of our senses and struggle against all forms of inequality , especially those of gender , class and race .
This is the hardest , he says , for we are all guilty of these sins .
And , he says , run as if from the plague from any conviction that history is on your side , a sentiment he sees as the greatest instigator of inequality and injustice .
His conclusion : we have a 50 - 50 chance of creating a better system , odds that are n’t half bad .
A press release from filmmaker and marine biologist , Randy Olson , suggests that the media may not be able to bury the brewing global warming collusion scandal .
Writes Olson :
An enormous event took place this week in the issue of global warming .
A group of climate skeptics hacked a research center in the U.K. and stole years worth of emails of climate scientists talking candidly about how to deal with skeptics .
Olson , who is promoting his new movie , Sizzle : A Global Warming Comedy , reports , " They 're calling it " Climategate " already .
The climate science world is ablaze with the issue .
The war between the scientists and the skeptics just got turned up several notches . "
What makes Olson 's release interesting is that he is not necessarily among the skeptics .
A Harvard Ph.D. , he also produced , Flock of Dodos , a satiric look at the Intelligent Design movement .
To its credit , Sizzle , like Dodos , allows the skeptics to make their case , but Olson 's sympathies are with the scientific community .
Olson cites a New York Times article by " my buddy Andy Revkin . "
Revkin quotes Patrick J. Michaels , a climatologist and prominent skeptic who appears in Sizzle .
Says Michaels of the scandal , " This is n't a smoking gun , it 's a mushroom cloud . "
Michaels is among those attacked in the purloined emails .
WASHINGTON  Senator Max Baucus , a powerful committee chairman and a chief architect of the Democratic health care overhaul , acknowledged Saturday that he had recommended the Obama administration appoint a woman he was dating to serve as the federal prosecutor in his home state , Montana .
In response to news media inquiries , Mr. Baucus , a Democrat and the chairman of the Finance Committee , said that he had already begun a relationship with the woman , Melodee Hanes , the director of his state operations , in February when he submitted her name along with two others as candidates to serve as United States attorney for the state .
When the relationship intensified , Mr. Baucus said , he and Ms. Hanes agreed jointly in March that she would withdraw from consideration , and another person was eventually nominated .
Ms. Hanes , 53 , an experienced prosecutor , then took a job at the Justice Department .
She and Mr. Baucus , both divorced , now live together .
“ It just made sense for her not to be a candidate because we were close , ” Mr. Baucus , 67 , said Saturday as he met with reporters just outside the Senate chamber .
He said Ms. Hanes began looking for a new position after they agreed she should no longer work in the Senate office because of their relationship .

I may be in a minority at the Ars Orbiting HQ , but I 've been a big fan of the Apple Mouse ( formerly known as the Mighty Mouse ) since its introduction .
I like the styling and the mouse 's functionality , and unlike some of my relatives , I can remember that something different will happen if I click with my finger on the right side of the mouse .
Of course , the Apple Mouse has its drawbacks , the chief of which is the tendency of the scrolling orb to get gummed up with palm cheese and stop working correctly .
When Apple announced the Magic Mouse , the feature list intrigued me , especially the gestures .
Since getting my MacBook Air , I 've become a big fan of the three - fingered swipe for navigation when surfing .
So Apple 's move to bring that functionality to its mouse lineup made ordering one an easy decision .
I placed my order the day the Magic Mouse was announced , and it arrived this past Friday .
Apple Magic Mouse Manufacturer Apple Price $ 69 Shop Ars System requirements Mac OS X 10.5.8 , Mac OS X 10.6.1
The mouse arrived in a nondescript brown box .
I opened it to find what looked like a plastic display case with a Magic Mouse encased therein .
Two AA batteries were installed with power switch on the bottom set to " off . "
I surfed over to apple.com to download the software ( Leopard version ) , and after a mandatory reboot , it was time to experience Apple 's latest attempt to improve the humble mouse .
After restarting , I attempted to discover the Magic Mouse using the " Set Up Bluetooth Device " option under the Bluetooth Status icon in my menu bar .
Unfortunately , it was unable to see the mouse , and after three attempts I opened up the Mouse panel in System Preferences ( the icon for which now bears an uncanny resemblance to the Magic Mouse ) .
From there , it was another 30 seconds until the mouse was recognized and happily guiding my cursor around my monitors .
As you can see in the screenshot below , the Magic Mouse takes over the the Mouse panel , so you can easily set it up .
Included options are secondary click ( e.g. , right - click ) , scrolling , screen zoom , and swipe navigation .
The Magic Mouse interprets downward and upward movements of the finger as scrolling , and you can configure it to scroll with momentum or without .
With momentum - less scrolling , the mouse works exactly like any other scroll wheel .
If you use momentum , you can easily scroll to the bottom of a giant window with a single , fast flick of the finger .
The Mouse panel in System Preferences after the Magic Mouse software is installed
For those used to ergonomic mice , the shape of the Magic Mouse will likely be a bit off - putting .
Its more gentle slope and metal sides are a stark contrast to the more voluptuous curves of the Apple Mouse .
At 4 ounces , it has a pleasing heft to it ( the Bluetooth Apple Mouse weighs 5 oz while the wired model comes in at about 3oz ) .
A tale of two mice
Usage
Unlike most other laser mice which use the underside of the mouse as the gliding surface , the Magic Mouse moves around the desktop on a pair of black plastic - looking rails .
The overall effect is a bit smoother than the Mighty Apple Mouse .
Unlike other vendors , Apple offers little in the way of technical specifics about the tracking ability of its mice , but after a few days of use , I will say that the Magic Mouse feels more precise than its predecessor , whether on my wood desk or a black granite countertop .
With its rather un -mouse - like shape , the Magic Mouse feels less comfortable than other mice .
The much - rounder Apple Mouse invites you to rest the full weight of your hand on it , but doing that on the Magic Mouse is n't that comfortable .
I find myself gripping it with a much lighter touch — not because I 'm worried about usage , but because it 's more comfortable that way .
Apple boasts that the Magic Mouse is the " world 's first Multi - Touch mouse , " and we 'll take the company at its word on that .
But what 's multitouch like when integrated into a mouse ?
It 's pretty sweet — most of the time .
Scrolling on the Magic Mouse is incredibly smooth , and since there are no mechanical parts , you do n't have to worry about junk getting into a scroll wheel ( or scroll ball ) .
Horizontal control is also more precise than with the Apple Mouse .
I keep the " scroll with momentum " option turned on , as it's very useful when navigating large pages .
The two - finger swipe is quite useful when browsing the Web , and I 've already stopped right - clicking to go backwards and forwards through my browser history .
You do n't even need to grip the mouse as you swipe ; there 's enough static friction to keep it from moving if you perform a hands - off gesture ( I 've tried on glass , wood , and granite ) .
If you have used screen zoom with the Apple Mouse , you 'll find the implementation with the Apple Mouse to be fairly intuitive — simply hold down the control key and swipe your finger across the top of the mouse .
But the Magic Mouse not all rainbows and unicorns .
If you want to right - click , you 'll need to get used to lifting your left - most finger off of the mouse in order for it to register correctly .
If you have an Apple Mouse , you 'll already be used to it — I do it without thinking , but that does n't change the fact that lifting your index finger into the air so your middle finger can click is a more stressful position for your hand .
I 've also noticed that the mouse will occasionally interpret a movement as a swipe , although this has only happened a couple of times .
Those of you who make middle - clicking a regular part of your mousing activities will want to avoid the Magic Mouse altogether : middle clicks are not supported at all .
But there 's one aspect of the Magic Mouse that may be a complete deal - breaker for long - time Apple Mouse users : no support for Expos ? and Dashboard actions .
For those who are n't familiar with the Apple Mouse , it offers the ability to activate Expos ? and Dashboard without using the keyboard or mousing over to a monitor hot corner .
I had my Apple Mouse configured to bring up Expos ?
when I squeezed the pressure - sensitive sides and launch Dashboard when I pressed down on the scroll ball .
After using the Magic Mouse for a half - hour , I realized how dreadfully much I used that functionality .
I use Expos ? for switching apps and windows when I 'm mousing ( if my hands are on my keyboard I 'll use command - tab and option - tab instead ) , and I use Dashboard several times a day as well .
Now that I 'm using the Magic Mouse , I 've got Dashboard and Expos ? mapped to the F18 and F19 keys on my extended keyboard , so there 's a minimum of movement between mouse and keyboard to active that them .
It 's an adequate workaround , but one that has destroyed a couple years ' worth of muscle memory .
The Apple Blog has posted a hack to get Expos ?
working with the Magic Mouse , and while I can confirm that it works , it does so at the expense of the functionality that makes Apple 's newest input device distinctive .
I was able to map Expos ? to a right - swipe by mapping right - swipe to F18 using MultiClutch , but right - swipe no longer worked for navigation in Safari .
I have yet to decide whether the Magic Mouse is much of an improvement over its predecessor .
The multitouch capability and lack of a scroll ball to gum up are definite upgrades , but the loss of Expos ? and Dashboard support about balance that out for me .
If you like your Apple Mouse 's pressure sensors and the ability to launch Expos ? and Dashboard from your mouse , you may want to give the Magic Mouse a pass until Apple figures out a way to support those features with its new mosue .
If you 're in love with multitouch and are tired of futzing with scroll wheels and scroll ball hand crud build - up , the Magic Mouse may be for you .
If you 're using a Logitech or some other third - party mouse and are wondering if it's time to give one of Apple 's eccentric mice a shot , it is n't .
The good
Swiping back and forth through your browser history beats clicking or keyboarding
Momentum scrolling is extremely well - implemented
No place for palm cheese to be deposited
Pleasing heft
Tracking
The bad
Not the most ergonomically pleasing mouse
Occasionally interprets movement as a swipe
Secondary - click implementation could be better
The ugly

In this advertisement released by Time Warner Cable , a warning that FOX has threatened to pull the plug on Time Warner Cable customers at midnight , New Year 's Eve , unless the cable company gives in to demands for massive price increases .

( AP ) --
For more than 60 years , TV stations have broadcast news , sports and entertainment for free and made their money by showing commercials .
That might not work much longer .
The business model is unraveling at ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox and the local stations that carry the networks ' programming .
Cable TV and the Web have fractured the audience for free TV and siphoned its ad dollars .
The recession has squeezed advertising further , forcing broadcasters to accelerate their push for new revenue to pay for programming .
That will play out in living rooms across the country .
The changes could mean higher cable or satellite TV bills , as the networks and local stations squeeze more fees from pay - TV providers such as Comcast and DirecTV for the right to show broadcast TV channels in their lineups .
The networks might even ditch free broadcast signals in the next few years .
Instead , they could operate as cable channels - a move that could spell the end of free TV as Americans have known it since the 1940s .
" Good programing is expensive , " Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corp. owns Fox , told a shareholder meeting this fall .
" It can no longer be supported solely by advertising revenues . "
Fox is pursuing its strategy in public , warning that its broadcasts - including college football bowl games - could go dark Friday for subscribers of Time Warner Cable , unless the pay - TV operator gives
Fox higher fees .
For its part , Time Warner Cable is asking customers whether it should " roll over " or " get tough " in negotiations .
The future of free TV also could be altered as the biggest pay - TV provider , Comcast Corp. , prepares to take control of NBC .
Comcast has not signaled plans to end NBC 's free broadcasts .
But Jeff Zucker , who runs NBC and its sister cable channels such as CNBC and Bravo , told investors this month that " the cable model is just superior to the broadcast model . "
The traditional broadcast model works like this : CBS , NBC , ABC and Fox distribute shows through a network of local stations .
The networks own a few stations in big markets , but most are " affiliates , " owned by separate companies .
Traditionally the networks paid affiliates to broadcast their shows , though those fees have dwindled to near nothing as local stations have seen their audience shrink .
What has n't changed is where the money mainly comes from : advertising .
Cable channels make most of their money by charging pay - TV providers a monthly fee per subscriber for their programing .
On average , the pay - TV providers pay about 26 cents for each channel they carry , according to research firm SNL Kagan .
A channel as highly rated as ESPN can get close to $ 4 , while some , such as MTV2 , go for just a few pennies .
With both advertising and fees , ESPN has seen its revenue grow to $ 6.3 billion this year from $ 1.8 billion a decade ago , according to SNL Kagan estimates .
It has been able to bid for premium events that networks had traditionally aired , such as football games .
Cable channels also have been able to fund high - quality shows , such as AMC's " Mad Men , " rather than recycling movies and TV series .
That , plus a growing number of channels , has given cable a bigger share of the ad pie .
In 1998 , cable channels drew roughly $ 9.1 billion , or 24 percent of total TV ad spending , according to the Television Bureau of Advertising .
By 2008 , they were getting $ 21.6 billion , or 39 percent .
Having two revenue streams - advertising and fees from pay - TV providers - has insulated cable channels from the recession .
In contrast , over - the - air stations have been forced to cut staff , and at least two broadcast groups sought bankruptcy protection this year .
Fox illustrates the trend :
Its broadcast operations reported a 54 percent drop in operating income for the quarter that ended in September .
Its cable channels , which include Fox News and FX , grew their operating income 41 percent .
Analyst Tom Love of ZenithOptimedia said he expects the big networks will end the year with a 9 percent drop in ad revenue , followed by an 8 percent drop in 2010 and zero growth in 2011 .
A small chunk of the ad revenue is being recouped online , where the networks sell episodes for a few dollars each or run ads alongside shows on sites such as Hulu .
Media economist Jack Myers projects online video advertising will grow into a $ 2 billion business by 2012 , from just $ 350 million to $ 400 million this year .
But that is not significant enough to make up for the lost ad revenue on the airwaves .
Advertisers spent $ 34 billion on broadcast commercials in 2008 , down by $ 2.4 billion from two years earlier , according to the Television Bureau of Advertising .
So rather than wait for the Internet to become a bigger source of income , the networks and local stations are mimicking what cable channels do :
They 're charging pay - TV companies a monthly fee per subscriber to carry their programming .
Since 1994 , the Federal Communications Commission has let networks and their affiliates seek payments for including their programming in the pay - TV lineup .
Not everyone demanded payments at first .
Instead they relied on the broader audience that cable and satellite gave them to increase what they could charge advertisers .
The big networks also were content to let their broadcast stations essentially be subsidized by higher fees for the cable channels that fell under the same corporate umbrella .
A pay - TV company negotiating with the Walt Disney Co. , which owns ABC , is likely paying more for the ABC Family channel than it otherwise would , with the extra assumed to help Disney cover its costs for the ABC network broadcasts .
But over time - such contracts generally run about three years - more networks began demanding payments for the stations they own .
And affiliates already receiving the fees have bargained for more money .
Some talks have been tense .
In 2007 , Sinclair Broadcast Group , which operates 32 network - affiliated stations around the country , pulled its signals for nearly a month from Mediacom Communications Corp. , which provides cable TV to about 1.3 million subscribers , mainly in small cities .
The American Cable Association says its members - mainly small cable TV providers - have seen their costs for carrying local TV stations more than triple over the past three years .
The group 's head , Matt Polka , says those fees have gone " straight to consumers ' pocketbooks " in the form of higher cable bills .
Gannett Co. , for instance , which operates 23 stations , has taken in $ 56 million in fees from pay - TV operators this year after negotiating a new batch of agreements , up from $ 18 million in 2008 .
Dave Lougee , president of Gannett 's broadcast arm , defends the fees , saying " broadcasters were late to the game in really starting to go after the fair market value of their signals . "
Analysts estimate CBS managed to get as much as 50 cents per subscriber in its most recent talks with pay - TV providers that carry CBS - owned stations .
CBS Corp. chief Leslie Moonves said such fees should add " hundreds of millions of dollars to revenues annually . "
That could be just the beginning .
CBS and Fox are also asking for a portion of the fees that their affiliates get , arguing that the networks ' shows are what give local stations the leverage to ask for fees .
Over time , the networks might be able to get even more money by abandoning the affiliate structure and undoing a key element of free TV .
Here 's why : Pay - TV providers are paying the networks only for the stations the networks own .
That amounts to a little less than a third of the TV audience , which means local affiliates recoup two - thirds of the fees .
If a network operated purely as a cable channel and cut the affiliates out , the network could get the fees for the entire pay - TV audience .
If forced to go independent , affiliates would have to air their own programming , including local news and syndicated shows .
Fitch Ratings analyst Jamie Rizzo predicts that at least one of the four broadcast networks " could explore " becoming a cable channel as early as 2011 .
Any shift would take years , as the networks untangle complicated affiliate contracts .
At an analyst conference last year , CBS 's Moonves called the idea an " a very interesting proposition . "
But he added that it " would really change the universe that we 're in . "

The mayor of Memphis , A C Wharton Jr. , has walked with bile rising in his throat through the streets of Hickory Hill and Orange Mound and Whitehaven in recent years , as house after house in those black neighborhoods has fallen into foreclosure .
On Wednesday , Mr. Wharton and other city and county officials filed a lawsuit accusing one of the nation ’s largest banks , Wells Fargo , of singling out black homeowners for high - interest subprime mortgages .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court in Tennessee , marshaled a raft of statistics to argue that Wells Fargo offered one lending reality for whites and another for blacks .
In Shelby County , which includes Memphis , one of every eight Wells Fargo loans in predominantly black neighborhoods resulted in foreclosure , compared with only one in 59 such loans in white neighborhoods , the lawsuit said .
Such charges , if proven , amount to reverse redlining  marketing expensive loan products specifically to black customers .

Virgina is following the national trend — it plans to regulate yoga studios that provide teacher training programs .
This means hefty fees and lots of paperwork for these studios .
Yesterday , the Institute for Justice ( “ IJ ” ) announced that it filed Kalish v. Milliken on behalf of three yoga instructors to challenge Virginia ’s plan to regulate them .
IJ asserts that regulation of yoga training programs is an unconstitutional restriction of free speech .
( Siouxsie has been unable to find a copy of the lawsuit anywhere .
This is a link to an article discussing the lawsuit . )
Interestingly , these Virginia yoga instructors did n’t try civil disobedience , praying or meditation to stop these regulations .
Instead , they opted for hardcore litigation to take on the regulators .
They even hired Clark Neily of IJ to do this — a libertarian and gun-rights advocate who is noted for his participation in the most important gun case in recent history , District of Columbia v. Heller .
Yikes .
Talk about strange bedfellows .
Siouxsie would like to side with the yogis on this one , but she just does n’t see it .
How are these yoga studios any different from other places that train individuals to teach a trade ?
In any event , it does n’t seem as if the Virginia yogis are against regulation per se .
R. Mark Davis , president and CEO of the Arlinton - based Yoga Alliance , notes that
the alliance ’s goal was to establish a form of self regulation and takes no position on whether states ought to issue licenses , but he said in other states most practitioners report no problems .
The biggest problem in Virginia , he said is the $ 2,500 upfront fee is exorbitant for small studios that only have a few students .
Perhaps , the lawsuit will pressure Virginia to revisit the amount of this fee .
Maybe that is the whole point of this lawsuit anyway .
Siouxsie only wishes these Virginia yoga instructors could have been more like the ones in New York .
When New York threatened to regulate licensing of yoga instructors
[t ] he teachers formed a coalition and enlisted a state senator . . . to take up their cause , hoping that New York would buck the national trend . . . .
That unity was on display . . . in a small studio in Midtown Manhattan , where nearly 100 devotees from around the state sat barefoot and cross-legged on the wood floor .
The group , whose members ranged from lithe young teachers in spandex to older ones in religious garb , opened with a traditional chant and ended two hours later struggling with parliamentary procedure as it established a formal organization .
[ The leader of the coalition ] prayed for “ some joyful conclusion .

Within days , [ the state ] [ announced ] that the department would suspend the licensing effort , allow the classes to continue and instead lobby for legislation adding yoga to a list of activities that are exempt from regulation .

Cigar Churchill smoked as he planned D - Day is discovered after being hidden for 66 years
A cigar smoked by Prime Minister Winston Churchill as he planned D - Day has been discovered - after being hidden for more than 60 years .
Christian Williams , 33 , was given the artefact when he was just 12 by his grandfather Ronald Williams , a WWII veteran who served as the British premier 's butler .
At more than 6in long , the cigar has never been touched by its owner , who keeps it safe in a sturdy wooden box .
Historic : Churchill 's cigar and place cards taken from the Casablanca Conference
It was taken from the historic Casablanca Conference at which Churchill and other Allied leaders declared they would fight until Germany ’s unconditional surrender .
At the January 1943 meeting , Churchill had wanted to launch the D - Day invasion of France that year - but instead it was agreed to tackle Italy first .
However , the conference set in motion planning for the cross - channel attack that took place on June 6 , 1944 .
Cigar fan : Churchill enjoyed smoking
Place cards bearing the names of the world leaders taken with the cigar from the conference combined with the testimony of Mr Williams ’s grandfather make its pedigree beyond doubt .
Mr Williams , a student at Lincoln College and lives in nearby Horncastle , said he felt honoured to own a piece of history .
He said : ‘ I ’ve kept the cigar a secret and completely to myself since my grandad gave it to me all those years ago .
‘ I can remember so clearly what he said to me as he handed it over .
He said : “ You ’ll know what to do with it one day and realise what it is . ”
‘ Even at 12 , I obviously knew who Churchill was , but I did n’t fully understand the relevance of the cigar until quite recently when I spoke to an expert .
‘ I ’ve never dared to touch it and never picked it out of its box , it ’s far too precious to me .
‘ I do n’t even keep it at home because I ’m worried about it , it ’s held in a safe place and I only take it from there for special occasions .
‘ It ’s a really powerful object because when I look at it I can really imagine where it came from .
‘ I guess I have got a 20th century icon , you think of Churchill and you think of the man with a big fat cigar in his mouth .

In colour : Churchill at the Jnauty 1943 conference with Roosevelt , who persuaded him to put back D - Day plans to invade France and instead take control of Italy first
‘ You can just imagine him saying “ Let ’s go with D - Day ” as he stood there puffing away on it . ’
Ronald Williams , who served in the 8th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment , had been asked to act as butler to the Prime Minister for the conference in 1943 .
The meeting , which had the codename of Symbol , was held from January 14 to 24 in the Anfa Hotel in Casablanca , Morocco .
Among the leaders present were U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and General Charles de Gaulle , leader of the Free French , who had recently regained control of their North African colony from the clutches of the Nazi puppet regime of Vichy France .
Proud owner : Christian Williams was given the cigar by his grandfather , Churchill 's butler , when he was 12
Notably absent , however , was Soviet dictator Josef Stalin , who stayed in Russia due to the raging battle of Stalingrad , which by that point the communists had nearly won .
And so , as Red Army soldiers finally began to roll back the Germans on the Eastern Front , the conference marked the turning point for the Allies in Western Europe .
At some point during the conference , most likely the end given the importance of the place cards , Ronald Williams decided to take some souvenirs of the occasion .
And in 1987 he passed the incredible heirloom down to grandson , a gift made especially poignant as he died just two years later at the age of 67 .
Mr Williams had the cigar valued at £ 800 by an expert during the filming of the Antiques Roadshow at Lincoln Cathedral .
Presenter Fiona
Bruce told him the place cards with the item and the details from his grandfather meant its history could be corroborated .
But he said he would not consider selling the precious items , unless it was to a very specific person .
Mr Williams said : ‘ He must have been clearing away at the end and must have put them in his pocket as keepsakes .
‘ I would n’t like to guess if it was something Churchill knew about , I simply do n’t know if there was an arrangement for him to take them or not .
‘ I would only ever sell it to the Churchill family or to a museum because I think it ’s too important to be shut away in a private collection .
‘ I think there are only a handful of his cigars left in existence , which makes this really special to me . ’
The math is easy -- simply do n't send 139 troops to Afghanistan next year .
That would cover the cost of averting brutal cuts to a public transit system used by more than 5 million people every day .
You get the idea .
Call it what you want - - a " troop year " perhaps .
Anytime some government agency grappling with revenue collapse caused by the economic meltdown announces an increase in fees or a cutback in services , just figure how many troops not being shipped into harm 's way in Helmand Province it would take to make that budget good .
Then spread the word !
Use the fact in conversations , letters to the editor , emails to friends and family , leaflets , faxes to Congresscritters who are about to vote to appropriate more money for the war .
People in this country may not like thinking about the war , but they sure can't help thinking about the economy .
This is a nice clear way to help them make the connection .
You know those college students in California who are in the middle of a fierce battle to block an unbelievable 32 % tuition increase ?
That 's right , just bring 505 troops who are already in Afghanistan home in 2010 .
Some of them might even want to enroll , too .

What do you know about how people live in Cairo or Beirut or Riyadh ?
What bearing does such information have upon your life ?
There are , of course , newspapers to keep responsible Americans up to date when trouble looms , and public television or even the History Channel to inform us about the occasional historic battle or archeological discovery or civil war .
What else do we need ?
The ways that people think and work and suffer and fall in love and make enemies and sometimes make revolutions is the stuff of novels , and Arabic novels , while not yet lining the shelves of the local bookstore , have been increasingly available in English translation , offering a marvellous array of answers to questions we did not know we wanted to ask .
On such subjects as : the nature of the clientele of the elegantly crumbling pre-Islamist bars in downtown Cairo , straight and gay ( “ The Yacoubian Building , ” by Alaa Al Aswany ) ; what it felt like to live through the massacre in the Shatila refugee camp , in 1982 , and how some of the people who still live there have been managing since ( “ Gate of the Sun , ” by Elias Khoury ) ; the optimal tactics that a good Saudi girl should use to avoid being married off , which appear to require that she study either medicine or dentistry ( “ Girls of Riyadh , ” by the twenty - something Rajaa Alsanea , who has herself completed an advanced degree in endodontics ) .
There is clearly insight as well as information in these books .
And then , considering the reduced size and the volatility of the world we share , we might recall the essential lesson of a very old Arabic book that everyone knows , “ The Thousand and One Nights ” — that stories can have the power to save your life .
Our long history of indifference has made it difficult , down the years , to come by stories of Arab life that do not involve genies or magic lamps .
True , the novel is a comparatively recent phenomenon in Arabic literature ; poetry , an ancient art , has traditionally held wider prestige .
The exciting new storytelling form , barely a century old , was adapted from the European novels that European armies brought in their wake : Napoleon ’s troops were in Cairo for three years , but , thanks to Egypt ’s Paris - worshipping nineteenth - century khedives , Balzac and Zola stayed for good .
The form developed sporadically in the first half of the last century , and no more than three or four Arabic novels appeared in English before the mid-fifties .
After the Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize , in 1988 , there was a significant surge of interest —
Mahfouz himself finally got an American commercial publisher — but the burden of bringing Arabic books to English readers still falls mainly on devoted translators , and on the small and heroic presses that have performed this service from the start .
Their joint efforts have rarely mattered more .
The Arab reading public , although avid for all sorts of fiction , in a plethora of newspapers and cheap feuilletons , has ( for evident economic reasons ) not fully embraced the novel as a published book .
Few Arabic novels sell enough copies to earn their authors anything like a living income ; even Mahfouz kept a civil - service job until he was sixty .
Today , the most sophisticated literary public is under siege .
“ Cairo writes , Beirut publishes , and Baghdad reads ” is a saying that prevailed in what now seems a dream of literary possibility , free of stifling fundamentalism , civic chaos , and bombs .
Lately , there has been a concerted effort by forces of intercultural good will , Arab and otherwise , to bring newer Arabic literary works to our attention , with annual prizes — culminating in the so - called Arabic Booker Prize , established in 2007 , in Abu Dhabi — whose principal aim is to secure international ( but primarily English - language ) publication .
From the fifties through the seventies , the United States pursued a far more extensive project : the Franklin Book Programs translated and distributed American books in the Arabic - speaking Middle East , and not only textbooks and dictionaries but “ Little Women , ” “ Ethan Frome , ” and “ The Bridge of San Luis Rey ” — books meant to promote “ the Western ideals of the dignity and freedom of individual men ” and to “ minimize the difficulty of Arab - Western collaboration . ”
These days , the privately sponsored Global Americana Institute is attempting to renew this sort of literary diplomacy , starting with the publication of selected essays by Thomas Jefferson in Arabic .
Yet , if the goal is collaboration , is n’t it as important to listen as to speak ?
There is little danger of encountering anything like official propaganda , since the Arab novelist stands , almost by definition — as a thinker , as a conduit of intellectual life — in opposition to the retrogressive forces in the modern Arab state .
Six years after winning the Nobel Prize , Mahfouz , aged eighty - two , was knifed in the neck by a religious zealot carrying out a fatwa issued by an Islamic cleric outraged by one of the books the Nobel committee had cited .
( Mahfouz survived , and lived for twelve more years , although he temporarily lost the use of his right hand and had to relearn how to write . *
The cleric is currently serving a life sentence in the United States , for his part in a conspiracy to bomb the United Nations and other New York monuments . )
Nothing so grave has happened to Alaa Al Aswany , whose “ Yacoubian Building , ” a skillful page - turner with a winning cast of characters , takes on the subjects of class oppression , government corruption , torture in prison , the rise of fundamentalism , and the Egyptian state ’s propensity to push even profoundly decent but poor young men to religious extremism and , ultimately , to killing .
Published in 2002 , by a private Cairo firm — there being no way to get such a manuscript through the state ’s official publishing house —
“ The Yacoubian Building ” quickly became one of the biggest best - sellers that the Arab world has ever seen .
In Humphrey Davies ’s smooth English translation ( Harper Perennial ; $ 13.95 ) , it has been an astonishingly big seller here , too , and the book has appeared in more than twenty other languages around the globe .
Al Aswany believes that his international fame has kept him safe , although he has frequently been accused in the state - run media of the crime of “ tarnishing Egypt ’s image abroad , ” and the public discussions that he used to host at a Cairo café were shut down by the police .
( He quickly relocated the discussions elsewhere . )
Even Rajaa Alsanea ’s breezy “ Sex and the City ” takeoff , “ Girls of Riyadh , ” was initially banned in the author ’s native Saudi Arabia , apparently for suggesting that upper - class Saudi girls might wish to escape their luxurious designer cages .
The details of life within the cage have riveted non-Saudi readers , and have made the suitably hip and chirpy English translation — by the estimable Marilyn Booth , in conjunction with the author — another rare example of the Arabic novel as American best - seller .
In this tight - locked cultural milieu , college girls who defy the Religious Police by wearing red on Valentine ’s Day take on the sheen of political subversives .
But what about literature ?
Is it possible for anything like the grandly traditional novel of character development and moral nuance to emerge from societies in extremis , from writers routinely constrained or assailed ?
A critic reviewing Orwell ’s “ 1984 ” complained that it might be truth , but it was n’t fiction .
We have , of course , come to see the novel as a form with many variant possibilities .
Mahfouz , who spun complex social tales out of the apparently unquenchable vivacity of Cairo life , was able to reanimate the models of Balzac and Zola , but more recent Arab writers tend , understandably , toward Kafka or García Márquez .
It should be no surprise that the prison novel has become a major Arabic genre ; the icy emptiness of Solzhenitsyn ’s Gulag has been replaced , in the literature of duress , with Arab writers ’ crowded and sweltering cells .
How could traditional fiction comprehend this reality ?
Whether any book will outlast its moment is impossible to say , but what follows is an account of some novels that are worth reading now , and that may prove to be worth reading even when newspapers divert our attention to wars and prisons somewhere else .
Iraq is clearly not an easy place to write a novel these days .
Even the brave young blogger known as Riverbend , the author of two published collections titled “ Baghdad Burning , ” fled with her family to Syria in the fall of 2007 , and was last heard from as she rediscovered the pleasures of walking without continuously looking behind her .
The American occupation has been the subject of a number of documentary films — more documentaries have been made about Iraq than about any other active conflict , thanks to the light weight and low cost of video cameras — but the care and cogitation required for a novel ( never mind the publishers and bookstores ) appear to have been most obtainable among members of the far - flung Iraqi diaspora , free in foreign lands to publish works that have often been simmering for years .
Mahmoud Saeed ’s “ Saddam City ” ( translated by Ahmad Sadri ; Saqi Books ; $ 12.95 ) was written in the early nineteen - eighties , soon after the author was released from the last of six terms of incarceration under Saddam Hussein .
Saeed left Iraq in 1985 , and managed to publish his book in Syria , albeit with two chapters destroyed , in the mid-nineties .
Since 1999 , he has lived in the United States , and for the past few years has taught Arabic literature and calligraphy in Chicago .
He is in his seventies now , with a substantial and award - winning body of work in Arabic behind him .
“ Saddam City , ” published at last in English in 2004 , is based on what he saw in jail — the original Arabic title is literally “ I Am the One Who Saw ” — which he recorded , he says , “ so that it would remain for future generations . ”
For all the horror it details , this is a startlingly warm and humane book .
Saeed , despite the incitements of his subject , does not aspire to the Kafkaesque — Kafka , it must be admitted , is among the most impossible of authors to emulate , along with García Márquez — but maintains a specificity of place and history ( this happened in Basra , that happened in Mosul ) and of the individuals who inhabit them .
Set mostly in the run-up to the Iran - Iraq War , in the late nineteen - seventies , this slender novel tells of a mild - mannered Basra schoolteacher who , although cautiously apolitical , is whisked off one day for “ a simple interrogation . ”
His subsequent experience in six levels of hell — six prisons in all — is exactingly described , but the long ordeal is mitigated , both for him and for the reader , by a dose of bitter humor , a share of personal good will , and the mutual trust that he discovers among the prisoners , a trust long since forfeited in the larger prison of the informer - ridden society outside .
Saeed ’s style is plain and direct , without literary pretensions , but with a tone of emotional delicacy that is as odd in the circumstances as it is touching : treated with courtesy by a single officer , after much cruelty , the prisoner refrains from asking questions about his arrest , because “ I did not want to appear to be exploiting his kindness . ”
Some references to unfamiliar figures and events benefit from the book ’s tidy footnotes .
And although Sadri ’s rendering begins stiffly , it soon becomes rhythmically fluent , and one ’s sense of reading a translation fades away .
Resilience against all odds appears to be characteristic of Saeed : the same force rises to a point of madcap buoyancy in “ The Soldier and the Pigs , ” one of four Saeed stories available from Amazon.com , in uneven English , for forty - nine cents each .
( A writer new to the country must try to make his work known any way he can . )
In this riotously original little tale of a soldier ’s plight among not only pigs but many , many frogs , also set during the Iran - Iraq War , we catch another glimpse of a writer with the power to translate foreign histories into stories that we can make our own .
Sinan Antoon ’s “ I’jaam ” ( City Lights ; $ 11.95 ) is in many ways about translation , and although it is also an Iraqi prison novel set in the era of Saddam , it is hard to imagine a treatment of that terrible subject more different from Saeed ’s .
Antoon is Baghdad - born , in his early forties , and he left Iraq after the first Gulf War , in 1991 ; he has a doctorate in Arabic literature from Harvard .
“ I ’jaam , ” his first novel , was published in Beirut in 2004 , and , impeccably translated by the author and Rebecca C. Johnson , appeared in English in 2007 .
Antoon , who currently teaches at New York University , has never been in prison .
His brief novel is a self - consciously literary work , complete with references to Orwell and an epigraph from Akhmatova , and is alert to the uses of language , in a closed political society , for both indoctrination and rebellion .
The title refers to the practice of adding dots — diacritical marks — to various letters of the Arabic alphabet , some of which are indistinguishable without these marks in place .
An undotted sequence of letters may signify a number of different words ; the correct translation can be determined only by context .
The story ’s intriguing premise is that a handwritten , undotted manuscript has been found in a file in Baghdad ’s Interior Ministry , and a functionary assigned to add the necessary dots and make a transcription : the resulting manuscript forms the body of the book .
The text turns out to be the work of a university student whose gift for political mockery got him sent to prison , where he wrote the manuscript — leaving out the dots to avoid further incrimination .
Its uncertain readings cause the scribe to offer footnotes to such perplexing references as “ the Ministry of Rupture and Inflammation ” ( “ Could this be the Ministry of Culture and Information ? ” ) and to such obvious errors as occur in the well - known song lyric that details how the nation ’s leader moves from house to house and “ fucks us into bed . ”
( “ Note : the original lyrics read ‘ tucks . ’ ” )
The student ’s ( and the author ’s ) delight in word games brightens the narrative but does not overwhelm it .
At times , the prison almost disappears , as the student seeks refuge in his memories of soccer games , of campus romance , even of the mandatory political demonstrations in support of the person identified only as the Leader .
Nevertheless , darkness closes in : the formerly dauntless young man , an aspiring poet , is raped by a prison guard and increasingly breaks down .
In his delirium , his fantasies are alluringly , if postmodernly , alphabetical :
The laughter rose and the dots fell , one after the other .
The letters that take no dots began to pick them up from the ground and put them in their buttonholes or on their heads , or to stand on them and look at themselves in the mirror .
One began to fight with the others , and stole their dots .
The sin stole shin ’s dots and then raised its fingers to its lips , with a loud “ Shhhh ! ”
The mim lay down on his stomach and raised his head to swallow the two dots he had picked up off the ground .
A lustful laughter swelled up , and the letters danced together , coupling in forbidden positions .
Still , the core of the experience is meant to be horribly real .
Antoon has said that he required years to approach the harsher aspects of the story , implying that he feared seeming presumptuous in claiming experience not his own .
What , after all , is the relevance of fact to fiction in a book like this ?
Should it be different from any other type of novel ?
There is surely a relationship between the density of detail in Saeed ’s book and his experience , as against Antoon ’s more formally focussed , internally preoccupied tone .
Or is this to confound truth with style ?
When reality is framed and shaped by imagination — in novels , as opposed to memoirs or histories — all the truth that we can vouch for is emotional and intellectual , and on the page .
“ Politics and the novel are an indivisible case , ” the Palestinian novelist Ghassan Kanafani wrote .
But even Kanafani , who also worked as a newspaperman and a spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , expressed the modern writer ’s absolute faith in the primacy of art .
“ My political position springs from my being a novelist , ” he explained .
“ I started writing the story of my Palestinian life before I found a clear political position or joined any organization . ”
Born under the British Mandate , in Acre , in 1936 , he was initially educated in French missionary schools , and — a fitting irony for a writer who all but invented a new national literature — he had to improve his Arabic later on .
He was twelve years old when Israel was founded , in 1948 , and he and his family ended up in a refugee camp in Damascus .
He worked as a teacher , first in the camp and then in Kuwait for several years , before moving to Beirut to begin his association with a new political magazine and a newly stirring Palestinian consciousness .
There , in 1962 , aged twenty - six and in hiding for want of a passport , he wrote “ Men in the Sun ” ( Lynne Rienner ; $ 12.95 ) , a novella about three Palestinian refugees who pay a smuggler to take them across a swath of the Iraqi desert to Kuwait : a work as searing as the relentless desert sun that blinds and burns the men , a work in which politics and art cannot be told apart .
“ In an effort to be more transparent , I ’ve grown back my evil goatee . ”

“ Men in the Sun ” is a classic of Palestinian writing , and mentioning it among recent Arabic books is a bit like mentioning a work by Hemingway in a discussion of up - and - coming Americans , except that Kanafani remains almost entirely unknown to English readers .
A few of the stories that round out the present volume are polemical and coarsely melodramatic ; Kanafani was nothing if not a man with a mission .
But “ Men in the Sun ” is , on the simplest level , a gripping tale that unfolds with Hitchcockian suspense as the reader is reduced to fearfully counting the minutes on the smuggler ’s wristwatch .
The prose is lean , swift , and — in Hilary Kilpatrick ’s translation — filled with phrases of startling rightness :
“ The lorry , a small world , black as night , made its way across the desert like a heavy drop of oil on a burning sheet of tin ” ; or , even better , “ The speedometer leapt forward like a white dog tied to a tent peg . ”
The realistic intensity of Kanafani ’s world tends to conceal his stylistic ambitions : the intricacy with which he weaves together past and present , fact and delusion , and the alternating voices of his characters , each of whom is drawn with the rapid assurance of a charcoal sketch .
But on a deeper level Kanafani ’s work is about the desperation that drove these men to such lengths to regain work and dignity ; it is about the longing — just emerging in the Palestinian public voice — for the moist earth and the olive trees of the villages left behind in 1948 .
Most painfully , it is about the awakening of self - recrimination for acquiescence in the loss , as in the thoughts of an old man who has been living “ like a beggar ” and decides to risk the journey :
One flight had to make an unscheduled landing in Mumbai
Cathay Pacific says its fleet of Airbus planes has been hit by a spate of mysterious toilet blockages .
The problem has been so serious that one flight from Riyadh had to land in Mumbai when the crew discovered none of the plane 's 10 toilets were working .
In other cases , the number of passengers boarding flights had to be restricted because of toilet problems .
Airbus engineers are now fitting new toilet pipes to the airline 's fleet and carrying out deep cleaning .
Cathay spokeswoman Carolyn Leung said although the exact cause of the blockages was unclear , passengers themselves may be partly to blame .
" You would be amazed what we find in the pipes when we clean the system - not just face towels but medicine bottles , socks , items of clothing and even children 's stuffed toys , " she said .
The toilets use high - speed vacuum pipes to take waste at up to 110 km / h ( 68 mph ) into a holding tank , which is then emptied between flights .
Any blockage usually affects all the toilets on one side of an aircraft .
The time for action is over ; the time for talk is now .
The annual State of the Union address ( SOTU ) , one of the lamest pseudo - spectacles in all of politics , is once again upon us .
The one bright side :
Even before the speech is over , it will already be forgotten .
SOTU is the equivalent of the old ABC Superstars competition from the 1970s , without the human drama of seeing whether Lou Ferrigno can finish an 800 - yard run .
It 's a mixed - up , shook - up exercise in ring - kissing theatrics and gravity - defying promises that no one even pretends will be kept .
Forget George W. Bush 's Mission to Mars , or Bill Clinton 's vow to " put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years . "
Do you even remember the current president 's prime - time joint session promise 11 months ago to " make hard choices to bring our deficit down " ?
This year , the SOTU can , should , and wo n't be remarkably brief , sparing us the Castro - length perorations of the Clinton years and the rhetorical mediocrity of the Bush era .
The country is mired in a long - term recession whose causes are largely the result of rotten government policies ( inflating the housing bubble , showering the economy with cheap money , etc. ) and whose length has been increased by equally rotten government responses that have kept markets from finding their true bottom while scaring businessess away from getting on with random acts of recovery .
Who in their right mind would start investing in the future when a trillion - dollar health care plan , a banking - regulation overhaul , and an enormous de facto carbon tax were all in the offing ?
Now is not the time either for Stimulus McTARP - HAMP Vol. 2 , nor mickey - mouse schemes like cash - for - caulkers , the vice president 's goofy plan to stimulate the economy by weatherizing vacant homes in Detroit .
So here 's some advice for President Barack Obama , who was elected on a platform of hope and change and has , after a year in office , helped dash hope by changing things mostly for the worse .
We write not as Democratic Party hacks who are slow to wipe the sparkles from their eyes ( we are n't asking you to recalibrate your " cool , detached temperament " ) , nor as Republican Party dead - enders ( who turned against TARP only upon learning it would be administered by you rather than John McCain ) .
Instead , we write as libertarian enthusiasts and political independents who think that the large majority of Americans that wants fewer government services and less government interference in our social and economic lives should , at long last , be taken seriously .
That means no longer pretending that the people who oppose Obamanomics are all opportunistic Republicans or mis-informed voters bedazzled by nefarious special interests .
Your policies are increasingly unpopular because they are no good .
Take the $ 787 billion stimulus package .
Fifty - six percent of Americans now oppose the stimulus , with only 42 percent supporting it .
A year ago , those numbers were reversed .
The American people have learned what economists such as Robert Barro and Valerie Ramey could have told you a long time ago : that a dollar increase in government spending results in no more ( and almost certainly less ) than a dollar increase in economic activity .
Your estimates about how many jobs would be " created " by the stimulus package — a term of art later modified to " saved or created , " then downgraded further to " funded " — have been slippery , unconvincing , and wildly off - base .
The same goes for your estimates on the unemployment rate , still in double digits and not improving despite confident predictions that the stimulus would cap the bleeding at 9 percent .
The stimulus is not unpopular because of evil lobbyists or hypocritical Republicans ( many of whom voted for George W. Bush 's forgotten and equally ineffective 2008 stimulus ) ; it 's unpopular because it transfers money from Main Street to Wall Street ( despite your many protestations to the contrary ) , and it 's unpopular because it does n't work .
It can't work , because government can only spend money by taking it from the current or future economy .
Not only that , the artificial props of federal spending puts off the day of reckoning for the very sectors of the economy that melted down in the first place : Housing , mortgage finance , and banking .
The best thing you can do for the economy right now is give it a break from some sort of real or imagined " transformational " program that requires continuously increasing debt ceilings .
Your spending priorities are less than compelling .
You campaigned on a promise to enact a " net spending cut " in federal outlays , a commendably ( if unconvincingly ) plain - spoken vow after the brazen irresponsibility of the Bush years .
Yet the first big spending bill you signed last March helped set what in the most hopeful case will be the equivalent of Bob Beamon 's Olympic long jump of 1968 — a record for spending that wo n't be touched for decades .
Despite your promise to cut earmarks , the bill was packed with more pork than the Oscar Meyer WeinerMobile , which is only one of the reasons why overall federal spending in fiscal year 2009 increased 32 percent over the previous year .
Tack onto all this the slow - motion car wreck that was health care " reform " ( your word , not ours ) .
At some point , you talked about the need to contain costs and introduce choice and competition into a system chronically short on both .
Yet in your big speech on the matter last fall , you ruled out the most basic reform of all : Breaking the link between employment and insurance , so that individuals can shop for and own their own policies regardless of work situation .
And the plans pushed forward by your filibuster - proof majority in the Senate did little to address these concerns , either , no matter how minutely they gamed the scoring rules set forth by the Congressional Budget Office .
You may have bought off Big Insurance with an individual mandate ( thereby growing the number of people they could insure , or be subsidized to insure ) and repeated the trick with Big Pharma through various plans to maintain or increase their market shares , but you could n't fool most of the people any of the time that the end result would over the long haul magically reduce , rather than balloon , the deficit .
We could add here a string of broken promises and dashed hopes on closing Guantanamo , reversing discrimination against gays , and paring back our overseas military commitments , but the headline story of your presidency is about one crucial thing : economic policy and results .
With the grime of governance having replaced the gauze of campaigning , the country has now been able to focus on something that was n't quite as clear in November 2008 :
That when it comes to basic economic orientation , the main " change " in this presidency is a reversion to the pre-Bill Clinton days of Keynesian faith in centralized planning by technocratic experts in the name of empathizing with the downtrodden .
It did n't work then , and it is n't working now .
You want to win back the faith that most voting Americans placed in you 14 months ago ?
Start by taking your own promises seriously , rather than treating them as short - term fixes for your long - term drop in popularity .
Continue by taking the American people seriously , by acknowledging that their differences of opinion with you on economic policy spring from a genuine place .
And finish by doing something no president since Bill Clinton has even tried : Scale back ambitions .
Pay as you go .
Limit the growth of government .
A thousand central planners before you have learned it the hard way : Prosperity is n't something the government creates , it 's something the government , in the best case , can enable , mostly by establishing a set of simple rules and getting the hell out of the way .

SPACE is big , ” wrote Douglas Adams in his book The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy .
“ You just wo n’t believe how vastly , hugely , mind - bogglingly big it is . ”
He was n’t exaggerating .
Even our nearest star Proxima Centauri is a staggering 4.2 light years away – more than 200,000 times the distance from the Earth to the sun .
Or , if you like , the equivalent of 50 million trips to the moon and back .
Such vast distances would seem to put the stars far beyond the reach of human explorers .
Suppose we had been able to hitch a ride on NASA ’s Voyager 1 the fastest interstellar space probe built to date .
Voyager 1 is now heading out of the solar system at about 17 kilometres per second .
At this rate it would take 74,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri – safe to say we would n’t be around to enjoy the view .
So what would it take for humans to reach the stars within a lifetime ?
For a start , we would need a spacecraft that can rush through the cosmos at close to the speed of light .
There has been no shortage of proposals : vehicles propelled by repeated blasts from hydrogen bombs , or from the annihilation of matter and antimatter .
Others resemble vast sailing ships with giant reflective sails , pushed along by laser beams .
All these ambitious schemes have their shortcomings and it is doubtful they could really go the distance .
Now there are two radical new possibilities on the table that might just enable us – or rather our distant …

Why a recall of tainted beef did n't include school lunches
When health officials identified an outbreak of salmonella poisonings last summer , they traced the dangerous strain of salmonella to ground beef made at Beef Packers Inc. , a major supplier to the National School Lunch Program .
At least 39 people reported getting sick in 11 states , and doctors found that the salmonella infections resisted many common antibiotics .
By early August , the U.S. Department of Agriculture convened a committee of experts and urged Beef Packers to recall 825,769 pounds of ground beef made in June at its facility in Fresno .
TROUBLE ON THE TRAY : Family 's nightmare began with secondary infection ORDER UP :
Healthy , organic and cheap school lunches ?
The recall , announced by the governmentAug.
6 , covered only ground beef sent to certain retailers .
In the days after it was announced , government and company spokesmen said meat sent to schools was not included .
Documents obtained by USA TODAY through the Freedom of Information Act reveal a more complicated story — one that raises questions about whether the government took adequate steps to ensure that meat it bought for schoolchildren during the same period was safe .
Even as public health officials told residents to throw out recalled products from the Fresno plant , the federal government paid Beef Packers hundreds of thousands of dollars for almost 450,000 pounds of ground beef made from June 5 to June 23 , the dates covered by the recall .
Four orders were produced for the school lunch program during that period , a USA TODAY investigation found .
One tested positive for salmonella Newport , the strain that prompted the recall and can cause diarrhea , abdominal cramps , fever and vomiting ; that order was rejected by the government .
Tests on the other three orders found no salmonella , and the beef was shipped from the plant before the recall was announced .
Because samples from the three orders of beef appeared salmonella - free , the meat made for schools was not included in the recall .
But lawmakers and food safety experts say the three orders should have been rejected nonetheless .
In part , that 's because the tests that led the government to release the beef are inconsistent and often wrong , says James Marsden , a professor of food safety and security at Kansas State University .
' Zero - tolerance ' policy
The government has a " zero - tolerance " policy for the pathogens E. coli O157:H7 and salmonella in ground beef bound for schools .
That means any sample that tests positive — such as the June 9 order that was destined for schools — must be rejected .
In the case of Beef Packers , the beef eventually sent to schools was produced on June 6 , 13 , and 20 ; each of those production runs came the day after the same assembly lines and equipment were used to produce beef that was recalled later .
The assembly lines are cleaned each night , and Marsden says it is " very unlikely " salmonella would have survived those cleanings .
Still , he remains concerned that the pathogen found another way into the ground beef bound for schools .
Because salmonella is seldom distributed evenly in any lot of beef , " 94 % of the time , I wo n't find it even though it 's there , " Marsden says of testing .
" Since one of the four lots tested positive , my recommendation would have been to include all four lots in the recall . "
Marsden calls the government 's zero - tolerance policy " courageous " and says the " food safety initiative for the school program has been very successful overall . "
But he says the Beef Packers case " highlights a potential flaw in the system that should be addressed . "
The government could have rejected all the lots .
It did not .
" The company had the option to include all of the school lunch product in the recall regardless of results of the test , and in my opinion , that 's what should have been done , " says Marsden , who also is the senior science adviser for the North American Meat Processors Association .
" It 's just poor decision - making . "
Beef Packers supports the government 's decision to release the beef for schools but is reluctant to rely on the tests as proof that the beef was salmonella - free .
" Well , I can only say , thank God there were no outbreaks at schools related to any of these products .
And that 's not saying much , " says Mark Klein , a spokesman for Cargill , which owns Beef Packers .
Government officials with the Agricultural Marketing Service , the arm of the USDA that runs the school lunch program , stand behind their decision .
In a written statement to USA TODAY , AMS Administrator Rayne Pegg said no meat is sent to schools until " tests confirm the product was not contaminated . "
Even so , in response to the USA TODAY investigation , Pegg said the USDA " plans to initiate an independent review " of its " testing procedures and process control requirements " next year .
Since finishing these orders , Beef Packers has bid on no more contracts for the National School Lunch Program , the company and the USDA say .
It had ranked among the top seven ground beef producers for schools from 2001 through 2009 .
Repeated problems
The problems this summer at Beef Packers should not have surprised the USDA or AMS .
Beef Packers , bought by Cargill in 2006 , has a checkered relationship with the program that provides food for 31 million schoolchildren across the nation .
In particular , the company has been haunted by its ground beef testing positive for salmonella .
Children are particularly vulnerable to food - borne illnesses .
USA TODAY identified hundreds of outbreaks at schools caused by pathogens from 1998 to 2007 , the last year for which data were available .
The outbreaks sickened at least 23,000 kids .
Although school districts buy most of the products served to kids at schools — often through food service management companies — the U.S. government provides much of the meat through its commodities program .
USA TODAY analyzed federal data on more than 360,000 orders placed by the government for beef , poultry and other products sent to schools .
The newspaper also examined results from more than 146,000 tests for bacteria including salmonella and E. coli , and reports of violations of government standards , complaints against producers by schools and suspensions of companies by the AMS .
Among providers of ground beef , Beef Packers stood out .
Government documents show the company failed to meet program requirements more than 40 times and had more than 1 million pounds of its ground beef rejected because of salmonella contamination during the 2003 - 04 school year .
In the following years , the company was suspended from the school lunch program three times — twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
Two of those suspensions came after the company repeatedly failed to produce ground beef that was free of salmonella , USA TODAY found .
Those suspensions lasted just a few days , until the company showed the government that it fixed its problems .
Even so , during the past three years , the company failed to meet requirements more often than all but one other ground beef supplier .
Beef Packers also ranked high among those whose meat frequently tested positive for dangerous pathogens .
In 2007 and 2008 , its rate of positive tests for salmonella measured almost twice the rate that 's typical for the nation 's best - performing , high - volume ground beef producers , USA TODAY found .
Still , the company kept getting government business .
Since 2003 , Beef Packers has garnered almost $ 60 million in contracts .
" When you 're dealing with repeated violations , why do we continue to reward these companies ? " asks Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , who chairs the House appropriations subcommittee on agriculture .
Until this week , many details that would help gauge a company 's performance remained hidden from public view .
The USDA said it was its policy , for instance , not to say which companies tested positive for pathogens .
In response to a USA TODAY request under the Freedom of Information Act submitted in October , the USDA released data from the tests but initially withheld the names of the companies that corresponded with each result .
Divulging their identities " would discourage companies from contracting to supply product for the National School Lunch Program and hamper our ability to provide the safe and nutritious foods to America 's school children , " USDA spokesman Bobby Gravitz wrote in an e-mail to USA TODAY .
" That 's unbelievable , " says Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D - N.Y . and a member of the committee that oversees the lunch program .
" We should have transparency in testing .
They should be required to disclose that information . "
The newspaper appealed the USDA 's decision .
On Monday , the department released the names of the companies .
Why no recall ?
When the USDA and Beef Packers issued the summer recall , Colorado health officials were gratified .
At least 21 Colorado residents had gotten sick from the Newport strain , and until this summer , the USDA had never championed a recall of raw ground beef that contained salmonella .
Scientists agree that cooking ground beef to an internal temperature of 165 degrees should kill the pathogen .
Even so , Colorado state epidemiologist Alicia Cronquist lauds the decision .
" We think it 's quite a dangerous thing to have multidrug - resistant salmonella in your ground beef , " Cronquist says .
Antibiotics typically control such infections .
USDA and AMS officials say they had no such concerns that the strain was in the school orders produced in June by Beef Packers .
In written responses provided to the newspaper , officials cite three primary reasons for not including the school products in the recall : • Tests on the ground beef were negative for pathogens .
The government relies on testing to help verify efforts to keep salmonella out of the production process .
Samples of the finished ground beef are taken by AMS workers and tested at a lab that contracts with the government .
The tests have shortcomings .
Typically , the samples represent just a fraction of the order — sometimes about one - 1000th of 1 % .
In 2006 , the USDA occasionally ran two tests for bacteria on the same batch of beef and the results were sometimes different .
Microbiologists are n't convinced that a single negative test proves much .
" You are looking at a very small sample size relative to the lot , so you probably are going to miss it if it's in there , " says Ewen Todd , a professor at Michigan State University .
Todd says the government could have tested the orders more than once .
It did not , records show .
" In this case , you know ( salmonella ) was in the system , so there 's a good chance it was in that ( school lunch ) product , " Todd says .
" If they wanted to be certain , they at least would have done a lot more testing .
… They should have tripled the number or done tenfold the number . "
Others agree .
" That blows my mind that they would accept those lots without a lot of additional testing , " says Barbara Kowalcyk , a biostatistician at the Center for Foodborne Illness Research & Prevention .
Kowalcyk understands the risks children face from dangerous pathogens .
In 2001 , her 2 - year - old son , Kevin , died of complications from an E. coli O157:H7 infection .
• The beef used to make school products is segregated from commercial products , so any contamination in commercial products should not carry over to the beef produced for schools .
The meat for schools " is made from raw beef source material that is targeted solely for AMS product , " explains Jerold Mande , the USDA 's acting undersecretary for food safety .
" The source materials and the finished product are subject to AMS testing protocol and required to meet all contractual specifications . "
AMS tests the meat destined for schools twice .
The first test screens the " source material " — the raw chunks of beef that have yet to be ground .
The second test examines the beef after grinding but before it is shipped .
Shortly before and during the dates of the recall , government inspectors had found evidence of problemsin the beef at least six different times — in both the " source material " and the finished product , documents obtained by USA TODAY show .
When the recall committee met Aug. 5 , the members knew , for instance , that " source material " used by Beef Packers had screened positive for pathogens on June 2 and June 12 .
They also knew that inspectors had identified problems with " source material " at Beef Packers on May 28 , June 16 and June 23 .
They knew that a test on one sample from ground beef meant for schools , taken on June 9 , also came back positive — this time for the Newport strain .
They knew that the Newport strain had surfaced in the plant before , in a May 21 test on commercial beef .
And they knew of another matter involving the company .
Inspectors had found a different strain of salmonella at Beef Packers earlier that summer .
Experts say the indicators were clear .
" Obviously the plant had an ongoing contamination problem , " Kowalcyk says .
Adds Marsden : " It appears they had a systemic problem . "
• The recall committee had no evidence that anyone had gotten sick from beef produced on the days products for schools were made .
The USDA recall committee determined the scope of the recall by looking at dates on which the commercial ground beef implicated in the illnesses had been made : June 5 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 19 , 22 and 23 .
The food sent to schools was " produced on days not associated with any illnesses , " Mande says : June 6 , 13 and 20 .
That explanation offers little solace , given how production for the school lunch program works .
USDA officials know , for instance , that Beef Packers made no commercial orders on the days that beef for the schools was produced .
Meat from those dates was sent to processors throughout July , but by Aug. 5 — the day officials met to consider the scope of the recall — the beef made for schools likely had not been served to anyone ; many schools were not in session .
Because the beef made for the schools likely had not been consumed by Aug. 5 , no illnesses could have been associated with those production days .
Where 's the beef ?
The decision to accept the school orders from Beef Packers rankles DeLauro and other lawmakers , who contend that the USDA should have been more cautious in what it sent to schools .
Documents reviewed by USA TODAY show no evidence that officials considered recalling the orders headed for schools .
" In my opinion , that 's criminal , " says Rep. Carolyn McCarthy , D - N.Y. , who chairs the House subcommittee on healthy families .
Last month , McCarthy joined Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , in calling for an investigation of the risk of contaminated beef getting into school lunches .
" We 're putting our children at that kind of risk ? " McCarthy asks .
" Speaking as a mother , my goodness .
We put that out to PTAs across this country , and we'd have an uprising . "
Gillibrand , the New York senator , says she plans to champion legislation that would require recalls on any products destined for schools that were made within dates covered by a commercial recall — regardless of what government testing shows .
" It should never have been sent to the schools , " Gillibrand says .
Klein , the spokesman for Beef Packers ' parent company Cargill , defends the government 's decision .
He points out that he knows of no more outbreaks attributed to the beef .
" It 's not a good answer to say that we 've essentially been proven right … but in reality , that is how it played out . "
Klein may be right ; the government has recorded no recent salmonella outbreaks among schoolkids .
But , as Colorado epidemiologist Cronquist points out , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate " there 's 38 salmonella cases for every one that gets reported …
The vast majority of salmonella cases we never tie to an outbreak .
They 're what we call sporadic . "
Further complicating matters : Neither the government nor Beef Packers knows where the ground beef made for schools during the recall period is today — or whether it has been consumed .
The USDA loses track of it when it is sent to a processor , where it might be made into taco meat or other products .
And although federal records also show schools in at least six states — including Illinois — were entitled to the Beef Packers meat , officials at the state and federal level say ground beef from one supplier is often mixed with other orders from other suppliers before being shipped to states .
As Mary Fergus , a spokeswoman for the Illinois State Board of Education , says of the meat : " It could be anywhere right now . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Monday that it would decide whether a university can deny recognition to a Christian student group because its members must agree with its religious views and it has barred gays and lesbians .
The justices agreed to hear an appeal by a chapter of the Christian Legal Society arguing the U.S. Constitution does not allow a school to deny recognition to a religious student group because it required its members to agree with its core views .
A U.S. appeals court ruled in favor of the University of California , Hastings College of the Law .
It denied recognition to the group because it does not conform to the school ’s policy that membership should be open to all .
The group required members to sign a statement of faith that vows devotion to Jesus Christ and it barred those with a “ sexually immoral lifestyle , ” including gays and lesbians .
Founded in 1961 , the Christian Legal Society maintained law student chapters across the country .
Its members hold Bible study meetings and discuss ways to apply their religious faith to the practice of law .
The chapter initially was open to all students , but in 2004 it began requiring members to endorse a statement of faith and barred anyone who engaged in “ unrepentant sexual conduct . ”
The law school withdrew official recognition , but allowed the group to still meet on campus .
A federal judge and then a U.S. appeals court ruled for the law school , holding that its policy was reasonable and “ viewpoint neutral ” and that it did not violate the rights of the Christian group .
But another federal appeals court , in Chicago , had ruled the other way in 2006 in a case involving a chapter of the Christian Legal Society and the Southern Illinois University School of Law .
By agreeing the hear the case , the Supreme Court is expected to resolve the conflicting rulings .
The justices are expected to hear arguments in the case in March , with a decision likely by the end of June .

Researchers have developed a novel animal model showing that four commonly used chemotherapy drugs disrupt the birth of new brain cells , and that the condition could be partially reversed with the growth factor IGF - 1 .
Published early online in the journal Cancer Investigation , the University of Rochester Medical Center study is relevant to the legions of cancer survivors who experience a frustrating decline in cognitive function after chemotherapy treatment , known as chemo - brain .
" It is not yet clear how our results can be generally applied to humans but we have taken a very significant step toward reproducing a debilitating condition and finding ways to treat it , " said Robert Gross , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of Neurology and of Pharmacology and Physiology at URMC and principal investigator of the study .
Chemo - brain is a newly recognized condition .
The URMC team found surprising data about how the four drugs impact the brain , Gross said , and they are the first to report that the experimental insulin - like growth factor , IGF - 1 , may be beneficial .
The study was funded by a Department of Defense grant to Gross and by the National Cancer Institute to co-investigator and lead author , Michelle Janelsins , Ph.D. , research assistant professor of Radiation Oncology at the James P. Wilmot Cancer Center .
More than 11 million Americans are living today after receiving a cancer diagnosis .
Many of them have endured chemotherapy and although the side effects during treatment are well known , the lingering neurological effects are more puzzling .
Patients often report memory lapses , trouble concentrating , confusion , difficulty multi-tasking and slow thinking for weeks , months or years after treatment ends .
The URMC team hypothesized that cognitive problems might stem from chemo destroying the ability of brain cells to regenerate in the hippocampus , which is primarily involved in memory formation and mood .
They sought a way to find the mechanisms at work and to manage the adverse effects on the brain before , during and after chemotherapy treatment .
Researchers also hypothesized that chemotherapy drugs known to cross the blood - brain barrier would be a bigger threat to brain cells than drugs that do not cross the blood - brain barrier .
To test the hypothesis , they investigated the effects of routinely used doses of cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil , which do cross into the brain , against paclitaxel and doxorubicin , which do not .
Unexpectedly , all four drugs caused a significant breakdown in brain cell proliferation in the animal model .
A statistical analysis of cell regeneration showed a 15.4 percent reduction in new brain cells following fluorouracil , a 30.5 percent reduction following cyclophosphamide , a 22.4 percent reduction following doxorubicin , and a 36 percent reduction following paclitaxel .
" It could be that all of the chemo drugs cross into the brain after all , or that they act via peripheral mechanisms , such as inflammation , that could open up the blood - brain barrier , " Gross said .
" Neurogenesis can also be altered by stress , sleep deprivation and depression , all of which are common among cancer patients , " added Janelsins .
" More thorough studies are needed to understand the interplay of these factors and the long - term effects of chemotherapy on the brain . "
Researchers conducted a second study of a single high dose of cyclophosphamide , a mainstay of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer , because chemo - brain is a frequent complaint of people receiving this drug .
The single high dose resulted in a 40.9 percent reduction in newly divided brain cells , the study said .
In previous studies the experimental growth hormone IGF - 1 had demonstrated that it could generally promote new brain cell development within the central nervous system .
Thus , investigators chose to test its effect in the animal model .
They administered IGF - 1 prior to and following a conventional cyclophosphamide multiple - dose regimen , and a single , high - dose of cyclophosphamide .
The IGF - 1 seemed to increase the number of new brain cells in both models , but was more effective in the high - dose model , the study concluded .
The research team plans to conduct additional studies which will allow them to further test the impact of IGF - 1 and other related interventions on the molecular and behavioral consequences of chemotherapy .

From a new species of giant rat to ants that took over the world , 2009 was a good year for new animal discoveries .
It was a year for all creatures great , with the mating ritual of the humpback whale filmed for the first time and the unearthing of a colossal sea monster .
And for the small , with one of the world 's tiniest parrots caught on camera , as was a polar bear cub hitching a ride on its mother 's back .
It was also a year where many species headed ever closer to extinction .
Nature of course is red in tooth and claw , and there were some illuminating insights into how death becomes every animal .
For start , it emerged that there is a generic ' smell of death ' to which all animals may respond .

We watched eagles hunting reindeer calves , and two stags locked in mortal combat , while we learnt how intelligent primates can struggle with grief .
Orang utans were recorded cannibalising their own already deceased young , perhaps in response to the emotional turmoil that apes go through when they lose an infant .
Grieving monkeys struggling with the loss of their newborn offspring were also recorded drinking their own milk .
On a more heartening note , we gained a number of insights into primate family life including : film of a family of spectral tarsiers , a battle between two vast baboon troops , grandmother monkeys seen stepping in to care for their grandchildren , a behaviour not recorded before , and gorilla mums clapping to attention badly behaved younger gorillas and male silverbacks .
Other family moments recorded this year were three cheetah brothers filmed cooperating to bring down a giant bird , and superpods of killer whales gathering into ' social clubs ' .
and the discovery that lions form prides to ensure they win turf wars with their neighbours .
The ultimate family story of 2009 , and perhaps of all time , was the news that a megacolony of ants has taken over the world .
Without sex , there can not be family .
Filmmakers from the BBC natural history series Life filmed the ' humpback heat run ' in its entirety for the first time .
They also filmed a marvellous hummingbird display , where a male spatuletail hummingbird put on an extraordinary show in a bid to convince a female to mate with him , and the ghostly yet entrancing dance of two mating seadragons .
Downright bizarre discoveries included the undersea crab that eats trees , a coral that eats jellyfish , a squirrel seen savaging a fruit bat and a host of weird creatures found in the lost world of an extinct volcano crater , including a giant rat , one of the world 's largest rat species discovered for the first time by scientists .
Professional and amateur palaentologists were pleasantly shocked by the unearthing of a colossal sea monster from rocky cliffs on the south coast of the UK , a place known as the ' Jurassic Coast . '
The ferocious sea monster , which terrorised oceans 150 million years ago , may yet turn out to be the largest marine pliosaur yet discovered .

Other discoveries about extinct creatures included the world 's oldest dinosaur burrow , and the revelation that starvation may have wiped out the giant deer , the largest deer species to have lived .
However , despite the wondrous and celebratory tone of many of the new things we learnt about the natural world in 2009 , the year also saw its share of less optimistic stories , those that act as a reminder of the perilous state of many species and the efforts of conservationists to preserve them .
Conservation groups uncovered evidence of a significant trade in big cat skins in China , and the scale of gorilla poaching in Africa was exposed .
Both Europe 's largest mammal , the bison , and the world 's largest cat , the amur tiger , were found to be on the ' genetic brink ' with the genetic health of their remaining populations falling .
Reindeer herds were found to be in global decline and it was realised that a giant fish verges on extinction , with a three - year quest to find the giant Chinese paddlefish in the Yangtze river failing to sight or catch a single individual .

In a bid to help some species , safe havens were created for rare primates while a new population of one of the world 's rarest crocodiles was returned to the wild .
But despite the extinction crisis threatening biodiversity across the planet , 2009 showed that animals everywhere still have a capacity to surprise and awe us .
Researchers revealed how they had witnessed the largest ever herd of Mongolian gazelles , where a quarter of a million Mongolian gazelles gathered on the country 's steppes , one of the world 's last great wildernesses .
Cameramen captured the first film of a giant stingray , while the rare Cross River gorilla was caught on camera , as was an elusive golden cat .
A 'lost seabird ' returned to the ocean while the world became excited by a new species of giant meat - eating plant discovered in the highlands of the central Philippines .
And last , but not least , after hundreds of years of studying them , scientists only just worked out that the cephalopods can hear you .
Oh boy , this is going to get good fast .
You already knew that the Nook , Barnes and Noble 's e-reader , had been rooted , right ?
Well , that was only step one .

That means a real life , breathing Android app is running on the Nook , which means more real life , breathing Android apps are eventually on their way .
It 's still a difficult process to do but the Nook may soon house all the apps that make Android great .
The Nook is probably the most interesting e-book reader on the market right now , to have a legion of users hacking and tinkering it to make it the most powerful , well , where can we buy one ?
Oh wait ... you ca n't right now .

I learned a long time ago to not listen to what people say but watch what they do , and in the case of Goldman Sachs ( NYSE : GS ) , their net shorting of Wells Fargo ( NYSE: GS ) , Mastercard ( NYSE : MA ) , PNC ( NYSE : PNC ) and AIG ( NYSE : AIG ) reveals they ’re not buying into the assertion that we ’ve started to enter a period of economic recovery ; on the contrary , they ’re betting against it .
In their recent quarterly filing , which is called a 13 F , Goldman asset managers revealed their largest positions in specific companies , and within those parameters , the largest short and long positions they have .
That simply means what stocks they believe will go up or down in price going forward .
As far as the strategy Goldman is employing , they ’re investing in shorts and longs , but when the smoke clears they ’re net short on the four stocks mentioned above .
Without getting into what that strategy means as far as how it protects from losses while promising the best gains , let ’s look at what it means from Goldman ’s current view of the economic crisis .
It ’s simple really .
Goldman is saying by their actions that the financial industry is still in shambles , and we are far from entering an economic recovery .
You do n’t offer net short positions unless you absolutely believe that .
Consequently , Goldman believe the future does n’t hold a lot of promise for these four financial stocks .
I ’m sure Citigroup ( NYSE: C ) would have been part of this as well , but shorting a $ 4 stock does n’t leave a lot of room to make money .
As of the release of the report from their asset managers , the net short position of the four companies are this : Goldman has shorted Wells Fargo by $ 289 million , Mastercard by $ 266 million , PNC by 202 million , and AIG by $ 152 million .
Together that ’s over $ 900 million .
Not a strong support for an economic recovery at all .
One interesting side on all this is Goldman itself is one of the most exposed financial companies in the world to derivatives , and when measured by derivatives as a percentage of assets , is over 8 times more exposed than their nearest competitor in the U.S. I wonder if Goldman shorted themselves ?
I ’ve been talking for some time on American Banking News on why the recession is far from over and the idea of recovery being a reality is ridiculous .
Here ’s another proof that others , within the industry itself , understand that as well .
The good news :
An increasing number of ambassadors posted to Washington are women .
The bad , but not surprising news :
The Washington Post , which covered this story on the front page of its print edition , buried this story in the " arts and living " section of its online edition .
Women making strides in economics , politics , business and life generally ?
Three out of four U.S. Secretaries of State in both Democratic and Republican administrations are women ?
India 's first female ambassador in 50 years ; a female ambassador from Oman and one from Colombia .
All are news ; all are important signals of movement toward equity of opportunity among women and men .
Coverage by mainstream media ?
Same old , same old .
I guess it can be argued that the Post did put the story above the fold on its print edition , but please tell me how it is that a White House state dinner gate - crasher story and NBC 's cancellation of Leno 's show merit the front page of the online edition , arguably used by an increasing number of people in government and politics not to mention outside DC , and a five - fold increase in women ambassadors since the nineties is " arts and living ? "
Blood pressure check .
Deep breath .
Back to the good part :
There are 25 female ambassadors posted in Washington , the highest number ever , according to the State Department .
" This is breaking precedent , " said Selma " Lucky " Roosevelt , a former U.S. chief of protocol .
Still " women remain a distinct minority -- there are 182 accredited ambassadors in Washington -- but their rise from a cadre of five in the late 1990s to five times that is opening up what had been an elite 's men club for more than a century . "
A key reason for the increase in the number of top U.S. diplomats who are women , according to the Mary Jordan , author of the Post article is what some call the " Hillary effect . "
" Hillary Clinton is so visible " as secretary of state , said Amelia Matos Sumbana , who just arrived as ambassador from Mozambique .
" She makes it easier for presidents to pick a woman for Washington . "
As the Post points out , Madeleine Albright became the first female U.S. secretary of state in 1997 .
Condoleezza Rice served from 2005 to 2009 .
Clinton , now in her second year , is especially well - known abroad because of her stint as first lady and her presidential run ; she is seen by many as a globetrotting champion of women 's rights .
" The pictures of U.S. diplomacy have been strongly dominated by photos of women recently , " Shankar said .
" That helps to broaden the acceptance of women in the field of diplomacy . "
Claudia Fritsche , the ambassador from Liechtenstein , a principality that only gave women the right to vote in 1984 , said the Albright - Rice - Clinton sequence has " a worldwide effect .
. . .
It 's inspiring , motivating and certainly encouraging . "
Albright said that when she spoke to foreign ministers around the world they told her governments had started thinking , " We need a Madeleine . "
Some American diplomats said the appointment of a woman can be a visible way for a country to signal that is modernizing and in step with the United States .
[ Except for those signs of regression on women 's rights in the U.S. , but we will avoid that issue for now . ]
Eleven of the 25 female envoys in Washington are from Africa .
Four are from Caribbean nations .
The others are from Bahrain , the Netherlands , Croatia , Kyrgyzstan , Singapore , Oman , Colombia , India , Liechtenstein and Nauru , an eight - square - mile Pacific island with only 14,000 people .
Heng Chee Chan , the Singaporean ambassador and the longest - serving female envoy in Washington , said it has been a " quantum leap " for women in diplomacy since she arrived here in 1996 .
Yet ....
" When a table was booked under " Ambassador Chan " and she arrived asking for it , she was told , ' Oh , he is not here yet . ' "
Many said they are still often bypassed in receiving lines and the male standing beside them is greeted as " Mr. Ambassador . "
" Even when I say I am ambassador , people assume I am the spouse , " said Shankar , who has represented India in Washington for nearly a year .
More than half of new recruits for the U.S. Foreign Service and 30 percent of the chiefs of mission are now women , according to the State Department .
That is a seismic shift from the days , as late as the 1970s , reports Jordan , when women in the Foreign Service had to quit when they married , a rule that did not apply to men .
" It was outrageous , " said Susan Johnson , president of the American Foreign Service Association .
" The idea was that a married woman could not be available for worldwide service .
She would be having children and making a home . "
That thinking is still alive in many parts of the world .
But as the U.S. Foreign Service moves away from being " pale , male and Yale , " the diplomatic ranks elsewhere are diversifying , too .
Apparently , the pale , male or just plain male focus at the major papers has not shifted in tandem .
What is clear is that this shift in the number of female ambassadors is changing the face and the content of international relations , even if slowly .
The Post quotes Cathy Tinsley , executive director of Georgetown University 's Women 's Leadership Initiative , as saying that gender diversity at the top of any organization leads to better decisions .
When all the decision - makers have a similar background and mind - set , they can " amplify the error . "
Carolina Barco , the only female ambassador to Washington from Latin America , and a mother of three who has served as Colombia 's foreign minister , said capability and preparation -- not gender -- are what count .
She held 630 meetings on Capitol Hill last year to lobby for a free trade agreement with the United States .
But several female ambassadors said they often bring a different perspective to discussions than their male counterparts and tend to focus more on certain issues such as poverty and lack of schooling for girls .
Shankar credited female leaders with turning the world 's spotlight
on the marginalization of Afghan women , and several U.S. diplomats said that since women have run the State Department , U.S. embassies have emphasized collecting information on rights abuses against women worldwide .
Several female ambassadors from developing countries said they are attentive to issues affecting families , such as health care and the lack of safe drinking water .
Albright said she guards against saying that women focus on " soft issues . "
" They are often the hardest issues : poverty , discrimination , education and health , " she said .
Female envoys often pool their power to land meetings with busy U.S. senators or media personalities .
A group recently met with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Maybe its time to pool their power to land meetings with the news and editorial sections of mainstream media outlets too .
This ain't about " arts and living , " boys .

20 ways you can help yourself and others during the COVID - 19 Pandemic
By Derek Scott
“ The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word ' crisis , ’ ” writes U.S. President , John F ....
2009 was a tough year for the auto industry to say the least .
Not only did we witness massive government bailouts , epic bankruptcies and a precipitous plummet in sales , but over 1,500 dealerships shuttered their doors .
When I was back in my hometown of Cleveland , OH over the holidays , I notice at least 6 large dealerships throughout the city that had closed up shop , with all of the remaining ones seemingly relegated to the ubiquitous “ Auto Mile ” of car lots mostly owned by large conglomerates .
A sad state indeed .
Current estimates peg the total number of new cars purchased last year at just around 10.5 million , which is about 7 million shy of the high reached in 2000 and 2 million below sales in China ( yes , we ’re no longer numero uno ) .
The Cars Allowance Rebate System ( CARS ) program , aka Cash for Clunkers , dolled out $ 2.8 billion in $ 3,500 – $ 4,500 rebates and supposedly resulted in 700,000 new car sales .
According to several leading analysts , this was just enough to keep the industry on life support while everyone scrambled to figure out how to infuse more cash into daily operations .
Even though many hailed the program as a success , it had its detractors as well , and for good reason .
Edmunds concluded that really only an additional 125,000 cars were sold that would n’t have sold otherwise , resulting in a taxpayer burden of $ 24,000 per vehicle .
Entering 2010 , the auto industry landscape looks quite different than years past .
There has n’t been a time in recent memory with so many shakeups , changes of ownership and jettisoning of brands as in the last couple of years .
Couple that with globalization and the increasing partnerships formed between large automakers , it ’s easy to miss what went down .
We thought it important to quickly run through the various car manufacturers to see where things netted out and just where we stand as we kick off 2010 .
US AUTO INDUSTRY
CHRYSLER ( Chrysler , Dodge , Jeep , RAM )
From 1988 until 2007 , ownership of this company rested in the hands of Germany ’s DaimlerChrysler AG group ( now Daimler AG ) .
However , in May 2007 , a majority stake in Chrysler was sold to Cerberus Capital Management , with the company changing its name to Chrysler LLC .
In the beginning of 2009 , Chrylser LLC filed for bankruptcy and emerged as Chrysler Group , with management controlled by Fiat , who took a 20 % minority stake .
Got it ?
Fiat now has the option to steadily increase ownership until outright control but , for the time being , the US government owns 8 % , the Canadian government has 2 % and the UAW a whopping 55 % share .
In the meantime , Sergio Marchionne , the new CEO of Chrysler and long - standing Fiat chief , has announced a 5 year plan to mix and match brands .
Chrysler , Dodge and Jeep will retain their American styling sensibilities but benefit from some Italian engineering .
Chrysler will also offer a handful of rebranded Fiats and Alfa Romeos .
And Dodge may also resell Alfa models .
RAM will be spun off on its own as it does n’t seem to fit .
Let ’s hope that this marriage is much more symbiotic than with Daimler , who seemed to sleep in a different bedroom .
FORD ( Ford , Lincoln , Mercury )
Ford also suffered a tough year , but was the one US auto company that did n’t take any TARP funds , a huge boon to its public image and perception of stability .
In addition , in a time when many companies were cutting back on R&D , Ford showcased their innovation by delivering new fuel - sipping EcoBoost engines along with the widely exulted Fusion Hybrid .
There are some analysts who believe that taking government funds or going through bankruptcy actually would have better positioned Ford in the marketplace against GM and Chrysler who are now lean and mean .
Ford is looking to prove them wrong , as the company took steps to reduce the fat by dropping their controlling interest in Mazda after unloading Jaguar and Land Rover to India ’s Tata Motors in 2008 and by putting Volvo up for sale .
The plan for Mercury is still unclear , with the nameplate down to just 4 models – Milan , Mariner , Mountaineer and Grand Marque .
GM ( Chevrolet , Buick , GMC , Cadillac ) / GM Europe ( Opel , Vauxhall )
GM took $ 50 billion from the government in exchange for a 60 % share in the company .
Pontiac was jettisoned in bankruptcy , with the 2010 Vibe and 2010 G6 ( available only for fleet service ) serving as the last remaining models .
The company ’s plans to sell Saturn and Saab both fell apart and the status of Hummer has been in limbo for months at the hands of its new Chinese suitor .
After working frantically to sell off the Opel division in Europe , GM backed away and decided to retain one of their only international brands .
This is actually good news for US consumers who will get some solid German engineering applied to Buick , which may hopefully continue to skew its demographics to a younger subset .
After all , it was only last year that Buick ’s marketing efforts focused on reaching consumer ’s “ maybe ” list , not exactly high expectations coming from that camp .
INTERNATIONAL AUTO INDUSTRY
ASTON MARTIN
From 1988 through 2007 , Aston Martin was a part of Ford Motor Company , as one of its marque brands in the upmarket Premier Automotive Group .
But in March of 2007 , Aston Martin was purchased by a joint - venture backed by two investment firms in Kuwait along with American businessman John Sinders and Prodrive owner David Richards .
Under Ford ’s stewardship , the brand ramped up sales significantly and it looks like the company will continue on this trajectory with new models such as the four - door Rapide and DBS Volante and halo - vehicles like the One - 77 creating brand exuberance .
One thing to pay close attention to may be Aston Martin ’s racing aspirations .
Sinders is an avid competitor and Richards runs a large motorsports company .
Last year at the 24 Hours of Le Mans , the company entered three LMP1 racecars for the first time in its history .
FIAT ( Ferrari , Fiat , Maserati , Alfa Romeo , Abarth , Lancia )
After a relationship with GM in early 2000 and a love affair with Ford in 2005 , it looks like Fiat has finally found the US partner is was so sorely yearning for in Chrysler .
We have been eagerly awaiting Fiat ’s return to our shores for quite some time , hoping to see more than just the Alfa Romeo 8C , which is absolutely gorgeous but outside of nearly everyone ’s price range .
Now , at the very least , we can look forward to Fiat platforms and engines in lineups from both Chrysler and Dodge .
And it looks like the Fiat 500 and the Alfa Romeo MiTo subcompacts might follow soon thereafter .
The biggest challenge is transforming Italian styling and design cues to fit with the meat - and - potatoes American consumer .
We just hope that Fiat does n’t sacrifice too much of what makes their cars so fantastic .
FISKER
Henrik Fisker , best known for his design finesse while at Aston Martin , has taken his unique styling and creative vision to the land of luxury hybrids .
With a trunk full of $ 529 million in US government loans , he plans to churn out plug-ins at a steady clip .
His first offering , the $ 80,000 Karma luxury sedan is slowly rolling off the production lines in Finland after satisfying all of the initial orders .
But the real goal here is for Fisker to move closer to the mass market by 2012 with lower - cost options including a $ 47,000 sedan with the code name Project Nina .
By occupying a vacated GM plant in Delaware , Fisker plans to keep things local and make Washington happy .
HONDA ( Acura )
Honda always seems to keep it slow and steady and this past year was no different .
Even though it took a sales hit like everyone else , the company managed to jump ahead of Chrysler to become # 4 in US sales behind GM , Toyota and Ford .
2009 marked the return of the Insight , the first commercial hybrid-electric sold in the US starting in 1999 .
Honda continued its push into alternative energies and showcased the FCX Clarity , a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle .
The company ’s biggest challenge looks to be the revival of its luxury brand , Acura , which has fallen behind the likes of Lexus and Infinity .
HUMMER
Hummer was on a tear before gas prices went through the roof and 6 mpg fuel economy was no longer acceptable with the green movement in full swing .
GM tentatively sold the brand to Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Inc , but China ’s government has been slow to sign - off on the deal .
The transaction was reportedly $ 150 million , with GM agreeing to continue production until 2012 , when Tengzhong would officially take over operations .
If they ever get the go - ahead , Tengzhong plans to introduce more fuel - efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles than the current lineup of fossil - sucking behemoths .
The Hummer brand , trademark and intellectual - property rights will all change hands .
Under the proposed agreement , existing Hummer dealers in the US would continue to function under the same contracts they had in place with GM .
That said , word on the street is that Beijing wants its automakers to remain domesticated and steer clear of foreign interests .
HYUNDAI-KIA
While the American car companies were struggling in the downturn , South Korea ’s automotive powerhouse was in a prime position to capitalize .
With outstanding warranties and price points that offered more features per dollar , the company was able to steal plenty of sales away from the Big 3 .
Hyundai went up to 4 points in market share in the US with a 6 % increase in sales .
Kia did even better by boosting sales 8 % .
On the global stage , Hyundai - Kia jumped past Ford , to become the world ’s 4th largest automaker behind Toyota , GM and VW .
Hyundai shocked everyone with their Genesis sedan , winning every conceivable automotive award , and the Genesis Coupe was heavily embraced by the import tuning crowd .
They also delivered the one - two by offering their industry - jarring Hyundai Assurance Plan , which appeased the fears of those worrying about making payments if they lost their job by allowing returns if particular conditions were met .
Soon after it was launched , Ford and GM scrambled to unveil copy - cat programs .
SAAB
GM has had little success trying to sell off the Swedish brand it acquired in 1989 and decided on December 18th , 2009 to “ wind down the business in an orderly and responsible manner . ”
After starting the process a year before , things actually looked promising as over 27 parties expressed interest in a potential purchase .
It turns out that only two came close to finalizing a deal and they were unlikely suitors .
Strangely enough , the two players involved – Spyker from the Netherlands and Koenigsegg from Sweden – were both boutique supercar manufacturers .
If you combined the output from both companies , they do n’t produce more than 100 vehicles a year .
Neither of these two companies could satisfy GM ’s concerns enough to take over the much larger brand .
China ’s Beijing Automotive scooped up Saab ’s spare parts and tooling operations , most likely to make a mint in their local market .
SATURN
For a long time Saturn was heralded as the one GM brand that the company got right , creating a true economical alternative to imports and a haggle - free purchase experience .
But after much fanfare it was left to play by itself in the late 1990s .
GM did n’t pay any attention to it for quite some time and when it finally did , it diminished Saturn ’s autonomy by pulling from its existing cache of models .
In 2006 , by the time they decided to refresh lineup with cars like the Sky , the damage had already been done .
Racing legend Roger Penske sought to increase his billion dollar auto empire by selling Saturns through his dealership network , but could n’t solidify a deal to handle the manufacturing side of things .
In September , the final closing announcement was made and over 370 Saturn dealerships were told of their fate .
Many are still seeking approval to stay on selling cars from GM ’s remaining brands .
Since Saturn dealers were some of the best in the business , hopefully the standouts will be given a reprieve .
SMART
After becoming a press favorite in 2008 when it launched , Smart looked like it had a promising future as a quirky new brand .
But when the recession struck , their message of fuel economy and low price still could n’t get Americans to commit to driving such tiny mobiles .
Sales went off a cliff with almost a 40 % drop , leaving many wondering about whether or not these cars are just a cute fad that flickered bright and then burned out .
Only time will tell …
SUBARU
Subaru came out of 2009 as a true rockstar .
While nearly everyone else was seeing red they were firmly in the black with almost a 14 % sales gain , topping the industry and raising many eyebrows .
How did they do so well with the economy so bad , you ask ?
A solid lineup of new cars including the Legacy , Forester and Outback helped offset percentage declines amongst the Impreza and Tribeca models , and allowed Subaru of America to record several record setting months .
SUZUKI
Suzuki ’s name is more synonymous with motorcycles and ATVs than cars .
In fact , many people do n’t even know they still makes cars since the Sidekick craze in the 90’s died off .
But alas , they are still kicking , with a new infusion of operating capital as VW took a 19 % stake on their quest for global domination .
If you keep your eyes out , you just may happen to spot the XL7 , first introduced in 2006 , somewhere out in the wild .
TATA MOTORS ( Jaguar , Land Rover , Tata )
After being harangued for many years for lack of vision and leaking money , Ford finally sold off their Jaguar and Land Rover ( JLR ) business to India ’s Tata Motors in 2008 .
Strangely enough , this was done just as both brands had finally found their stride with the new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport and the redesigned Jaguar XF and XJ models winning the hearts and minds of drivers everywhere .
The monetary situation is still no better with Tata than with Ford .
Let ’s hope that Tata can weather the storm of financial losses that rained down a $ 504 million line of red on their balance sheet .
With many components now being made in India to cut costs , let ’s also hope that their model lineup does n’t suffer as they scramble to curb losses .
After all , nobody wants to think that their new $ 85,000 XK Coupe is sharing parts with a $ 2,500 Nano .
TESLA
With the CEO ’s office a perpetual revolving door , Tesla has finally found some stability with co-founder Elon Musk back at the helm .
And with a large supply of government booty , $ 464 million worth , Tesla is kicking production into high gear .
With the $ 102,000 Roadster already being delivered , the company is moving on to ramp up production for their next offering , the Model S , which will be built in California at a former NASA site .
With high hopes of a late 2011 launch , the Model S will move into the product lineup as a BMW - fighter in the $ 50,000 price range ( after a $ 7,500 government rebate ) .
Tesla is also working with Daimler AG to deliver an electric powertrain for the SMART brand which is looking to unleash a fleet of EV cars .
TOYOTA ( Toyota , Lexus )
Last year , Toyota finally showed a chink in their armor , taking a $ 4.8 billion loss for its fiscal year as sales across the globe belly - flopped .
They also rolled out the largest recall in the company ’s history affecting nearly 4.2 million cars and trucks in danger of “ floor mat entrapment of accelerator pedals . ”
Since 2002 , it has been reported that as many as 19 people have lost their lives due to this engineering goof .
Back in Japan , Akio Toyoda , grandson of the company ’s founder , took over from Katsuaki Watanabe .
His focus is now on moving away from the large , expensive models that the company has been churning out to focus on changing the culture of the company .
He has stated that Toyota is “ grasping for salvation ” and that “ We have to make better cars . ”
Nobody knows what that all means but Toyoda certainly does , which is ok by us .
VOLKSWAGEN ( Audi , Bentley , Bugatti , Lamborghini , SEAT , Volkswagen , Scania , Porsche )
The saga between the Volkswagen Group and Porsche this year would make for a great movie .
Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking tried to work some financial wizardry to take over the much larger Volkswagen .
But as the global economy entered a massive recession , Porsche racked up $ 14 billion in debt in a failed attempt to gain a majority stake .
In fact , the process almost forced Porsche into bankruptcy , were it not for some last minute rope - a - dope from VW board chairman , 72 year - old Ferdinand Piëch , who expertly maneuvered to turn the tables and absorb Porsche instead .
Now we can look forward ( or not ) to 911s and Panameras with VW badges .
We imagine things may be awkward for a bit but long - term this could amount to some pretty fantastic automobiles as the companies share their part bins .
For example , Porsche is looking to build an electric car and the technology in the Audi e-Tron looks to be a perfect match .
VOLVO
Ford snagged Volvo for $ 6.5 billion premium back in 1999 as an effort to bolster its Premier Automotive Group ( which also included Aston Martin , Jaguar , Land Rover ) and sell luxury cars alongside Mustangs at mega- dealerships .
The plan never worked out and they have been having a fire - sale over the last couple of years .
It looks like China ’s Geely is going to pony up scant $ 2 billion for the brand and take things over .
The deal is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2010 .
The Scam That Will Not Die NIGERIAN ADVANCE-FEE SCAMS HAVE FOOLED AMERICANS FOR DECADES .
THANKS TO THE INTERNET , THEY'RE NOW STAGING A DISTURBING RESURGENCE .
( MONEY Magazine ) – Imagine turning on your computer and finding an e-mail like this .
CONFIDENTIAL : Dear Sir , Good day and compliments .
This letter will definitely come to you as a huge surprise , but I implore you to take the time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go off a long way to determine the future and continued existence of the entire members of my family .
Please allow me to introduce myself .
My name is Dr. ( Mrs. ) Mariam Abacha , the wife of the late head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces of the federal republic of Nigeria who died on the 8th of June 1998 .
My ordeal started immediately after my husband 's death on the morning of 8th June 1998 , and the subsequent take over of government by the last administration .
The present democratic government is determined to portray all the good work of my late husband in a bad light and have gone as far as confiscating all my late husband 's assets , properties , freezing our accounts both within and outside Nigeria ...
My late husband had / has Eighty Million USD ( $ 80,000,000.00 ) specially preserved and well packed in trunk boxes of which only my husband and I knew about .
It is packed in such a way to forestall just anybody having access to it .
It is this sum that I seek your assistance to get out of Nigeria as soon as possible before the present civilian government finds out about it and confiscate it just like they have done to all our assets .
I implore you to please give consideration to my predicament and help a widow in need .
May Allah show you mercy as you do so .
Your faithfully , Dr ( Mrs. ) Mariam Abacha ( M.O.N )
What Dr. ( Mrs. )
Abacha is saying here is that she 's so desperate for help moving this $ 80 million that she has been reduced to sending plaintive e-mail messages to regular people she does n't know in America .
Most sane people , upon seeing that sort of thing in their In boxes , realize the letter is n't really from Mrs. Abacha , assume that it's a scam or a joke and simply hit delete .
Others , however , take the bait .
They respond , tentatively at first , but also with a furtive glimmer of hope or greed or anxiety that can be used to turn even a levelheaded citizen into a gold - plated sucker .
E-mail exchanges and phone calls follow .
Over time , bit by bit , the proposition starts to seem real :
Help move the money and get a cut of that $ 80 mil .
Eventually the mark finds himself talking to a very intelligent and persuasive person with an African accent who has been designated to act for Mrs. Abacha .
The African will describe several trunks packed with $ 100 bills , all of which have been dyed black or stamped with red to prevent them from being stolen .
He 'll produce official - looking documents concerning the money .
He 'll even produce a few genuine bills and clean them with a mystery solvent .
It will be explained that transporting , storing , insuring and cleaning the rest will require money -- maybe $ 50,000 - - in exchange for which Mrs. Abacha 's agent will offer a hefty slice of the $ 80 million .
Convinced by the cleaned bills that he 's seen with his own eyes , the mark will raise the money ( maybe enlisting friends and family to help ) , deliver it and wait for the payoff .
But there will be delays .
More money may be required to pay an export duty or to bribe Nigerian customs officials .
Then even that wo n't be enough .
More will be needed .
And then more again .
Eventually Mrs. Abacha 's representative will disappear .
Eventually the mark will realize he 's been had .
SECOND ONLY TO " HERBAL VIAGRA "
This kind of advance - fee scam - - or 419 scam , for the section of the Nigerian penal code that covers it -- has been a thriving enterprise for at least 20 years .
It is , by some estimates , the second - largest industry in Nigeria , after oil .
Only a tiny fraction of the people who receive an advance - fee pitch fall for it , of course .
But if you increase the number of appeals -- and , thanks to the Internet , they are increasing at an alarming rate -- the number of suckers grows proportionately .
In addition , there 's reason to believe that fraction has been growing as well : Scams of all kinds flourish when times are good and the stock market is hot , conditions that until recently prevailed here in the U.S. According to the U.S. Secret Service , which polices such scams in this country and recently opened a branch office in Lagos , Nigeria , to fight them , West African advance - fee scams have cost Americans $ 100 million over the past three years .
How did Nigeria become such a prolific source of those swindles ?
Having been on the receiving end of generations of colonial rule , the populace of Nigeria ( and neighbors like Ghana and the Ivory Coast ) is generally well educated , English - speaking and very poor .
After gaining its independence in 1960 , Nigeria suffered decades of freewheeling official corruption , exacerbated by religious and ethnic strife and greased by money from the country 's oil and mineral resources .
U.S. law - enforcement authorities say Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo appears serious about cleaning things up , but the task is huge and the progress , by all accounts , glacial .
In its most recent Corruption Perceptions index , the nonprofit monitoring group Transparency International ranked Nigeria second only to Bangladesh in crookedness .
In short , Nigeria -- Africa 's fastest - growing country -- has become a place where even honest people learn to game the system just to survive .
And in that environment , it 's only logical that the real crooks would be very good at what they do .
It 's also logical that this talent would busy itself fleecing the English - speaking world 's largest pool of wealth .
Bruce Townsend , chief of the Secret Service 's financial crimes division , says West African gangs are well organized and have diversified into things like bank fraud , identity theft and drug dealing .
Their sophistication naturally extends to technology , so the once laborious business of trolling for suckers is now done easily , quickly and anonymously via bulk e-mail and fax .
" It 's very easy , " a spokesman for Nigeria 's antifraud agencies told the newspaper Newswatch .
Would - be scammers merely walk into one of the country 's many Internet cafes and set up an online account .
" All it costs , " he added , " is a few hundred naira . "
The equivalent , that is , of about three U.S. dollars .
The Washington , D.C. - based National Consumer League says that West African advance - fee fraud is now the third biggest consumer come - on on the Internet .
According to antispam software maker Brightmail , the only kind of junk e-mail more common are pitches for " herbal Viagra . "
That some Americans will fall for almost any well - packaged financial scheme , no matter how insane , has long been understood by both freelance con artists and their Wall Street cousins .
( The box on page 111 offers a brief look at some of the 20th century 's most notorious examples . )
But a handful of Americans have lost more than money to Nigerian scams , usually when they 've been convinced to go to Africa or Europe , where they 're more vulnerable .
Last August , Kenyan police rescued three kidnapped Americans who'd been lured to Nairobi by a Nigerian gang .
A year earlier , Jerry Stratton , a Florida plumbing contractor who'd been bilked of about $ 67,000 , went to London deluded into thinking he could recover his money from the West African " businessmen " with whom he'd been dealing .
Ultimately , Stratton killed himself in his hotel room , leaving a note .
" If anything happens to me , " it read , " look for three people .
They are Nigerians .
They are responsible . "
" GOING SHOPPING " WITH BUZZ SILER
On paper , advance - fee come-ons seem so preposterous that it's hard to see how anyone could fall for them .
Swindling , though , is a kind of theater , and a gifted performer can make even the most tired script come to life .
The best Nigerian con artists are experienced , sophisticated and quick to adapt to changing circumstances and exploit newly glimpsed weaknesses .
( Recent waves of e-mail have incorporated post - 9 - 11 angles , in some instances , invoking the fortune of a rich Nigerian , killed in the attacks , who left no heirs . )
A rare glimpse into such artistry comes to us via Lawrence " Buzz " Siler .
A Portland , Ore. inventor who runs a company that makes money pouches and other security gadgets for banks , Siler got a fax from the ubiquitous Mrs. Abacha , describing $ 25.6 million she wanted invested on her behalf in the U.S. , in the autumn of 2000 .
" Obviously somebody offering you $ 25 million is pretty ridiculous , so I wrote back just to see where it was all going , " Siler says .
He also called the FBI , which put him in touch with the Secret Service , which in turn enlisted him as an undercover agent .
Soon Siler was getting a steady stream of pitches from several would - be scammers , among them one Victor Okiti , a Nigerian who , it turned out , had twice entered this country under a false identity .
Siler says the tenacity and professionalism of the various con men who contacted him was impressive .
Like all adept salesmen , they tailored their spiel to the mood of their target .
When Siler seemed to respond to the soft sell , they 'd sweet - talk him .
Once , when he balked at putting down a $ 25,000 advance fee , Okiti berated him about all the people who'd taken risks on his behalf .
Siler spoke to Okiti and others innumerable times over a period of months .
Bit by bit , he says , the deals that at first seemed so phony almost started to seem real .
" There was a very thin line that I could have stepped over to start believing these guys , " he says .
While continuing to string along Okiti , Siler met with two other teams of scammers in Atlanta hotel rooms , each time bringing along money provided by the Secret Service and a female agent posing as his girlfriend .
Once each transaction was done , Siler was to say a prearranged code phrase and a group of armed agents would burst in from the adjoining room and make arrests .
( The busts did n't go off without a hitch : During one of the two Atlanta stings , Siler had to say -- then shout -- the code words " go shopping " three times before the agents heard him . )
Then last summer Siler met Victor Okiti in a Houston hotel room .
Okiti showed him a trunk of $ 100 bills , each stamped with " UN " -- meaning , he was told , unnegotiable .
Naturally , they would need to be cleaned .
Secret Service agents videotaped the meeting via hidden camera and arrested Okiti .
Last August he pleaded guilty to wire fraud and counterfeiting and is now serving an 18 - month federal sentence .
A PHILADELPHIA STORY
Many con men have mastered the technical aspects of their craft : careful preparation , meticulous documentation , back - up stories and the like .
Perhaps what distinguishes the true artists among them is an ability to turn their dupes into quasi-accomplices .
Astonishingly often , the swindle - ee actually expedites his own fleecing through a kind of temporary insanity , a willingness -- or desperation -- to suspend disbelief and prolong the possibility of getting rich quick .
The most interesting ( not to mention , weirdest ) example of this phenomenon may be the advance - fee fraud case of Edward Mezvinsky , a 64 - year - old former Democratic congressman from Iowa .
A onetime liberal folk hero who , as a member of the House Judiciary Committee , voted to impeach President Nixon in 1974 , Mezvinsky later served as President Carter 's representative to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights , before setting himself up as a Philadelphia - based lawyer and self - described international businessman .
He is scheduled to go on trial in Philadelphia this fall to face a 66 - count federal indictment accusing him of stealing some $ 10.4 million .
The list of alleged victims includes not only numerous banks and business associates , but also several longtime friends and his mother - in - law .
His wife Marjorie Margolies - Mezvinsky , also a former member of Congress , was thought to have a bright future in national Democratic politics until her husband 's fall .
Some of the frauds Mezvinsky is accused of were fairly simple affairs with no connection -- directly , anyway - - to West African cons .
But he was also involved -- sometimes as scammer and sometimes as sucker -- in several deals that come straight out of the Nigerian playbook .
Starting in the early 1990s , Mezvinsky found himself being tapped repeatedly by a parade of West Africans .
According to Robert Zauzmer , the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case , a " sort of mailing list of potential victims " appears to circulate along the Nigerian grapevine .
( This explains why Buzz Siler got so many pitches -- and why he was able to help bust three separate groups of scammers . )
Mezvinsky must have been a con artist 's dream : an apparently upstanding American pol who 's financially ambitious and has access to wealthy friends and banks only too happy to lend him money .
Most significantly , however , it appears Mezvinsky believed , or wanted to believe , their increasingly crazy pitches .
( He declined to be interviewed for this article . )
Of the approximately $ 13.3 million that flowed through Mezvinsky 's bank accounts between 1995 and 2000 -- most of it , says Zauzmer , the product of fraud or embezzlement -- about $ 2.6 million went to con men , a portion of which turned up in bank accounts in New York City and Boston that federal investigators believe were controlled by West African swindlers .
Starting in the late 1980s , according to Zauzmer , Mezvinsky got involved in a series of shady dealings .
He began scamming a long list of victims , many of them friends , promising big returns from West African oil or investment schemes .
Starting in late 1996 , Mezvinsky solicited $ 365,000 from a Maryland urologist .
A year later he got $ 1 million from a certified financial planner in Florida .
Between January 1998 and January 1999 , he received $ 1.2 million from an Italian businessman .
In 1999 he got yet another $ 1 million from a retired Pennsylvania business executive and $ 500,000 from a Virginia investor .
Each got a different story , but the general pitch was that if they would give Mezvinsky their money -- which he promised to hold in trust at a U.S. bank , risk - free - - he would guarantee a hefty and quick profit .
But even as Mezvinsky was scamming people , he was letting himself get scammed by West Africans -- apparently hoping that the big score would help him pay off the large debts he was accumulating .
The whole thing crashed to earth when David Sonders , the Virginia investor , sued .
Soon after , in January 2000 , Mezvinsky and his wife declared bankruptcy .
The filing shows debts in excess of $ 7 million , much of it unsecured personal loans from friends and business associates , including $ 25,000 lent in 1999 by Bernard Nussbaum , a prominent New York City attorney and President Clinton 's first White House counsel .
( Nussbaum declined to discuss the matter . )
Mezvinsky 's wife pulled out of the race for the Democratic nomination to one of Pennsylvania 's U.S. Senate seats .
Amazingly , even all that public humiliation was n't enough to scare him away from African hustlers .
Just six months later -- by which time FBI agents were looking into his affairs -- Mezvinsky convinced Robert Farrell , a Maryland friend and business associate , to fly to Chicago to scope out a deal for him .
Farrell says he was met at Chicago 's Midway Airport by a man with an African accent and a gun who drove him to a self - storage facility near the University of Chicago .
There he was shown a wooden chest supposedly containing -- what else ? --$ 81 million in $ 100 bills , dyed black .
At a nearby motel , a second African , a " Mr. Timothy , " produced a vial of liquid , poured it into a bucket of water and soaked some of the bills .
They were rinsed and dried and given to Farrell , who was driven back to the airport with bills in hand .
Farrell says he does n't know if the deal proceeded further .
Meanwhile , Mezvinsky -- who since December has been confined to his home by a federal judge and ordered to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet -- is mounting an unorthodox defense .
His lawyers argue that any responsibility he may have is diminished by a combination of manic depression and Lariam , an antimalarial drug that is , in fact , known to cause unpleasant temporary psychological effects in some people .
( Mezvinsky also sued Hoffman - LaRoche , the maker of the drug , and the doctor who had prescribed it , a longtime friend . )
A federal judge will rule this summer on whether he 'll allow the mental - health defense .
If not , and Mezvinsky is found guilty , he could spend seven years in federal prison .
One way or another , he 's likely headed for jail -- but the Africans who defrauded him are not .
No doubt they 're as far away from Philadelphia as they can get , whoever they are .
Which in one respect makes the whole Mezvinsky fiasco , for all of its convolutions , a typical Nigerian advance - fee swindle .
The mark has been fleeced , his money has vanished , and no one knows who or where the scammers are .
A New Zealand man living in Queensland and believed to be behind the world 's largest spam operation , has been ordered to pay more than $ 16 million for running the illegal enterprise .
Lance Atkinson , 26 , originally from Christchurch , was living in Pelican Waters on the Sunshine Coast when the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) had his assets frozen last year .
The house on Queensland 's Gold Coast that is registered as being owned by Lance Atkinson , a New Zealander implicated in a global spam email operation .
He had previously admitted sending spam and was fined $ 100,000 by a New Zealand court , but the FTC saw that further punishment was due .
Yesterday , the Commission fined him $ 16 million in a decision mirroring that of the Federal Court in Brisbane in October , which handed the same penalty to handed to two SMS spamming companies .
The FTC found Atkinson and American Jody Smith were at the centre of the world 's largest internet spam operation , dubbed " AffKing " , having recruited spammers from around the world .
Tres Amigas Proposes First Renewable Energy Market Hub
Wind blows at night in the lonely Dakotas and down through the empty middle of the country .
Nobody lives in our sunbaked deserts where afternoon solar power can be most effective .
Any potential central superstation would need to both connect stranded renewable sources to consumers on the other side of the continent in other time zones and be capable of carrying very high power as we add a powerful national grid .
The Tres Amigas plan would begin to achieve both these goals with America ’s first renewable energy market hub .
Tres Amigas is developing a $ 1 billion connecting hub that would work like a traffic roundabout for the nations three main grids so that large amounts of electricity can be moved from our producing regions to consuming regions ; using superconductor electricity pipelines from American Superconductor .
It would connect three main sections of our grids , pulling the electricity from the three grids and redirecting it to wherever there ’s greatest demand .
It would consist of high capacity connections able to transfer and balance 5 gigawatts of electricity among the three grids .
Clovis , New Mexico would be the site for the giant triangular superstation .
Tres Amigas would consist of a ‘ triangular electricity pathway ’ of superconductor electricity ‘ pipelines ’ , several kilometres on a side , to be that will feed power into and out of the Tres Amigas SuperStation through multiple AC / DC converters , each connected by DC superconductor cables .
American Superconductor ’s Superconductor Electricity Pipelines would comprise transmission - level DC superconductor power cables powered by high temperature superconductor wire and high - powered voltage - source AC / DC power converters .
It would cost an estimated $ 1 billion , and Tres Amigas has acquired lease rights to begin the two year $ 30,803 study of the 58 square kilometer site on state trust land near the Texas border .
As a merchant transmission system , Tres Amigas will charge a fee for use of the power hub .
American Superconductor is helping with finance in return for a minority equity interest for $ 1.75 million in cash and AMSC stock .
Tres Amigas CEO Phil Harris , who developed the concept for the Tres Amigas SuperStation was formerly the CEO of PJM Interconnection , which serves 14 states and is the world ’s largest transmission balancing area with over 240,000 megawatts under management .
There are lots of reasons for the Balkanisation of all the small transmission grids that comprise the American grid .
It is a difficult problem to overcome , but we begin by uniting America ’s three main power grids , to add renewable power to our energy supply .

Here 's a question , prompted by Saturday Night Live :
Why is it okay to mock a situation that may or may not have involved domestic violence , but not okay to have a serious discussion about it ?
Advertisement
In the almost two weeks since his Thanksgiving weekend car crash , much has been speculated about the state of Tiger Woods 's marriage ... and the reason for the crash itself .
( In a press conference last week , the Florida Highway patrol announced that its representatives saw no evidence of anything but reckless driving and , in a statement a few days later , Woods confessed to " transgressions . " )
Advertisement
Of course , Tiger 's reported infidelity and problems with his wife are private matters , but matters that filtered through to the public consciousness long ago .
Nothing better epitomizes this than this past Saturday 's SNL skit with Keenan Thompson playing Tiger Woods and Blake Lively as his wife Elin .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The skit moves the assumptions about what happened to Tiger Woods three steps forward .
" Elin " is shown standing behind Woods at a press conference , during which Woods makes increasingly feeble excuses as to his battered state , finally holding up a sign saying " help me . "
Many of the excuses the writers provide are classic lines from the domestic violence " script " ( " I fell down the stairs ... " ) and Elin hovering behind him menacingly is supposed to add to the laughs .
Obviously , many people found this funny .
But in the context of how we talk about domestic violence in this country , I found it downright depressing .
It 's hard enough to get these sorts of conversation going without a catalyst - reports on domestic violence often go unremarked upon , and unless there is a celebrity hook , most news outlets will not spend much time going into detail about those reports .
And , as we saw in the case of Chris Brown and Rihanna - the latter was the musical guest on SNL , as Hortense pointed out - even if it eventually emerges that domestic violence did occur in a high - profile couple , most of the public conversation revolves around blaming the victim and trying to silence discussion entirely .
But , as Elizabeth Mendez Barry wrote over on The New Agenda , the way in which we frame such conversations has a great many unintended consequences :
The Bloods have a strict policy against domestic violence .
That 's what a 16 - year - old male affiliate proudly told me last year before a weekly " gang awareness " meeting of about fifteen teens , most of them Crips , Bloods or Latin Kings , at a high school in Castle Hill , the Bronx .
That week , the topic was domestic violence , and several members of the group , including the 16 - year - old , said that hitting a woman was never acceptable .
Others argued that there were situations where it just could n't be helped .
The conversation turned to an article I had written about domestic violence in the hip hop industry for Vibe .
The rapper Big Pun grew up near the high school , and his devastating abuse of his wife ( which started when the couple was just 16 ) was described in the piece .
" I heard she cheated on him , " said the only young woman in the group , and others repeated some of the many rumors that swirled around Pun 's wife when she told her story ( up until then she had been Soundview 's favorite widow ) .
Several people enthusiastically launched into scenarios where it was OK to hit a woman .
There were many .
The bottom line : sometimes you 've got to teach a woman a lesson if she gets out of line .
It sounded like a man 's responsibility .
In the midst of the rationalizing , one usually talkative young man stood up and walked out .
When he returned twenty minutes later , he quietly told the group that his aunt had recently been murdered by her abusive boyfriend .
It was no longer a hypothetical conversation .
The jokes stopped .
Young men who were significantly invested in their inner gangsters gave them time off , and started talking about how domestic violence had affected their lives–and it had affected most of them .
The young woman , who minutes before had been arguing in favor of beating females who did n't know their place , talked about how despite the rules , male gang members beat up on female gang members .
Behind her swagger , she seemed anxious .
Why discuss teenage gang members when the issue at hand is a couple of unaffiliated celebrities ?
Because frank conversations like the one I described are rare , but they 're crucial to stopping relationship violence and healing the wounds it inflicts not just on its victims , but on their families , and even on abusers , many of whom grew up in abusive households themselves .
Because of one young man 's honesty about his own experiences , everyone else anted up .
The conversation got past knee jerk reactions , and revealed some of the pain lurking behind them .
It certainly did n't resolve all the issues that came up , but it was a start that gave a group of teens an opportunity to share the conflicting emotions they had about the issue .
Advertisement
Teenagers and children are listening to how we treat these conversations .
With Chris Brown and Rihanna , many different groups , writers , and bloggers spoke out against victim blaming , about stereotyping based on race or nationality and about quickly forcing someone into the advocate role .
With Tiger Woods it 's a bit more difficult .
It 's true that we do not know exactly what happened , in large part because Woods and his family are n't elaborating and , perhaps more importantly , because the State of Florida sees no further reason to suspect domestic violence .
Thing is , with skits like the one shown on SNL , the message being sent is that it is okay to joke about punishing men with force .
That it 's understandable for women to react to allegations of infidelity with violence .
Such demonstrations tell us that men bearing the brunt of a woman 's rage should be the subject of laughter , not concern .

Some , of course , wo n't see what the big deal is .
Admittedly , I did n't either - until recently .
I was walking through New York one night with a friend when we passed a heterosexual couple who appeared to be having an argument - but with an inverted dynamic .
In this case , the male ( who was taller and heavier set than the woman ) was trying to retreat while the female aggressively screamed , pulled and tugged at him .
I sighed and kept going .
After we got about a block up the street , my friend stopped me .
" I 'm sorry , and I 'm sorry for dragging you into this , but we really have to go back . "
She explained that her brother was in a situation with an ex-girlfriend that was violent and full of manipulation , but that neither police , nor his apartment security took seriously the fact that his petite ex-girlfriend was out to do him bodily harm .
" I have to help , " she pressed .
We turned around .
Standing on the corner closest to the still - warring couple , she asked , " I 'm sorry to be intrusive , but do you need any help ? "
" Mind your business bitch ! " shouted the woman , now trying to leap onto the man 's back .

" Yes , I do , " he said .
The woman hit him .
For the next twenty minutes , the four of us engaged in horrible game of frogger : my friend and I would flag down a cab , and the woman would physically block the man from getting in and leaving the scene .
Repeatedly , he lifted his hands , making sure to announce loudly " I am not touching you , I am not trying to touch you , please let me get in the cab . "

Occasionally , the woman would remember we were around and would scream at us to leave - she was insistent that he come home with her and not to his house .
After the third pissed off cabdriver left with no charge , we decided to call the police .
The man did n't want us to leave and the woman showed no signs of giving in .
When the cops showed up a few minutes later , one of the officers rolled his eyes .
We left .
Even with that experience , I might have not taken violence against men seriously - except for the fact that it kept cropping up in seemingly strange places .
A coworker laughed off a prominent mark on his face with a bashful , " oh , you know the wife . "
A friend asked me to accompany him to pick up his child in an increasingly rancorous ( and increasingly violent ) shared custody situation .
Another coworker initiated divorce proceedings when the honeymoon went sour and his wife started taking literal bites out of his skin .

I know many people will shrug this off as well - but it's worth asking why we sweep violence against women under the rug , and play violence against men for laughs , but are still too afraid to risk confronting any of these issues directly .
Saturday Night Live writers : I 'm asking you first .
Update : TMZ reports that The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence is not pleased :
During the show , the audience laughs , but Smith claims , " There 's nothing funny about this story , particularly if violence was part of the events that took place ...
I hope that SNL refrains from using this kind of skit in the future as it diminishes people 's support for victims of domestic violence . "

Heineken said Monday that it would buy the beer operations of Femsa , one of the biggest brewers in Mexico , in an all - share transaction that values the business at $ 7.6 billion .
The move would further consolidate the beer industry into a few global players .
The move will make Heineken a “ more competitive player in Latin America , one of the world ’s most profitable and fastest - growing beer markets , ” the chairman and chief executive of Heineken , Jean - François van Boxmeer , said in a statement .
Heineken will issue 86 million new shares to finance the deal , the first time it has done so for a takeover since 1968 .
Heineken shares were up 1.075 euros , or 3.26 percent , to 34 euros on the Amsterdam exchange .
After the deal closes , Femsa will hold 20 percent of the Heineken Group , making it one of the Dutch brewer ’s largest shareholders .
Femsa will also have the right to appoint two nonexecutive directors .
The transaction is expected be completed in the second quarter of 2010 .
Inter Coach Jose Mourinho Faces One Month Ban & Sack For Journalist Fight - Report
The Portuguese coach could face a lengthy spell in the stands ...
Southern California 's continued drought has prompted water restrictions and a focus on landscaping that requires little or no water , an increasingly popular concept in green homes nationwide that is known as xeriscaping .
California homeowners are ripping out brown grass and turning instead to synthetic turf , low - water native plants such as rosemary , lilac and yuccas and no-water alternatives such as gravel and cactus , according to a recent story in USA TODAY .
Such landscaping , which can be as beautiful as it is practical , is catching on nationwide as a cornerstone of green home building , aimed at conserving both energy and water .
In the eco-friendly home that my husband and I are building in Falls Church , Va. , we plan no grass at all .
We 've sold our lawn mower !
There are many resources available to guide people toward low - water landscaping , including this brochure from the Environmental Protection Agency that you can download .
In 1981 , the Denver Water Department coined and copyrighted the term " xeriscaping , " defined as " quality landscaping that conserves water and protects the environment . "
It combines the Greek word " xeros " or " dry " with landscaping .
Colorado Waterwise , a non-profit group , provides an online guide to the seven principles of xeriscaping :
-- Plan carefully .
Create a plan that includes the footprint of the house , driveway , patios , walkways and all trees , shrubs and garden beds .
Also include directions ( which way is north ) and the location of spigots , downspouts and external electrical outlets .
-- Create practical turf areas .
Think about where it makes sense to have grass , rather than putting turf everywhere .
-- Select and group plants appropriately .
There is a misconception among some people that the only plants allowed in a xeriscape are cactus and other desert perennials .
There are a large number of plants that do well in our semiarid climate with little or no supplemental irrigation .
The trick to waterwise gardening is to put the right plants in the right place .
-- Improve the soil .
The better the soil , the more successful a xeriscape will be .
-- Mulch .
It minimizes evaporation , cools plant root zones , reduces weed growth and helps control erosion .
Mulch also adds a finished look to the garden .
-- Efficient irrigation .
The best time to water is during the morning or evening hours .
Keep water close to the ground .
Avoid the oscillating type of sprinkler that sends water high into the air .
Design your sprinkler system or plan your hose placement so a given zone waters plants with similar watering requirements at the same time .
-- Maintain the landscape .
No garden is completely maintenance - free .
Like more traditional landscape , xeriscapes require regular maintenance to look their best .
This includes pruning shrubs and trees , deadheading perennials , aerating , mowing and fertilizing lawns and controlling pests .
Readers :
What experience , if any , have you had with xeriscaping ?
Any pictures you 'd like to share ?
After having delivered an eCommerce site to a client , he called me on the phone , explaining that he had experienced some problems ordering products .
While on the phone , I explained to him that I would do a test order to see if I could reconstruct the problem he experienced .
The ordering went fine , but suddenly he says
Client : “ Wow , I got an order from you here .
You want that Jacuzzi ?
I ’d suggest [ some Jacuzzi name ] instead ! ”
Me : “ As I explained to you , that was a test order .
I do n’t want any Jacuzzi ”
Client : “ Well , you ordered one , now you have to pay .
I ’ll just take it of your invoice . ”
Ebenezer Scrooge is the focal character of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens .
At the beginning of the novella , Scrooge is a cold - hearted miser who despises Christmas .
Scrooge ’s catchphrase , “ Bah , humbug ! ” is often used to express disgust with many of the modern Christmas traditions .
The modern day equivalent is typically a grumpy billionaire like Donald Trump , but in this list we ’re going to look at some historical figures who proudly uphold the Scrooge tradition …
4 ) Andrew Carnegie
Second richest man in history
His Riches
How rich was Carnegie ?
He is regarded as the second richest man in history , worth $ 293.3 billion dollars in today ’s time — 3 times more than Bill Gates .
Making most of his fortune from the booming steel industry in the late 19th century , Carnegie soon had fingers in everything from bonds , to sleeping cars .
His Scroogyness
Carnegie was so cheap , that he once “ lost a dime .
It is said that he got on his knees , and searched for the dime until he found it . ”
This guy , who is worth the GDP of Zimbabwe , looked for something that most of us would n’t have given a second thought .
Another famous anecdote was how he tipped a dime once , at a meal .
Unless he was eating at a $ 2 restaurant , it was unacceptable .
It is unknown if it is the same dime mentioned above , although knowing Carnegie , we would n’t be surprised if he had originally picked it up with his next meal in mind .
Scrooge Rating ( out of 10 )
Carnegie was a noted philanthropist , and by his death , had given an estimated $ 35 billion dollars away — again , massively more than Bill Gate ’s philanthropy of $ 28 billion ( Suck it , Bill ! )
So , I suppose we could forgive him for the two ( one ? ) dimes .
3 ) John Elwes
The man Dickens based Scrooge on
His Riches
A Member of Parliament of Britain in the 1700s , Elwes inherited his wealth from his mother and his uncle .
Although his mother left him £ 100,000 ( which would be like , a trillion dollars today ) , she reputedly starved to death , as she was too stingy to spend the money ; while his uncle left his £ 250,000 , but prided himself on spending only £ 110 a year .
Which ultimate leads us to ask the question : is being a selfish jerk hereditary ?
His Scroogyness
Elwes was so damn stingy , that he has an entire section in his Wikipedia page dedicated to his “ Miserliness ” .
Elwes dressed in beggars clothing ; went to sleep when the sun set to save candles ; would eat rotten food before buying new ones , once eating the remains left by a rat ; refused to see a doctor , even when he had been shot ; and ultimately lived on £ 50 a year .
Scrooge Rating ( out of 10 )
When Elwes lay dying , he forced his lawyer to draw his £ 800,000 will in firelight to save the cost of a candle .
One .
Single .
Candle .
Despite all this , Elwes was n’t really an asshole , just stingy .
2 ) Hetty Green
Richest woman in the world
Her Riches
Green inherited $ 104 million of today ’s dollar from her father .
She made her business in railroads and real estate , and was estimated to have been worth anywhere from $ 1.39 billion to $ 2.78 billion — making her the richest woman in the world at that time .
Her Scroogyness
Remember Carnegie , who got on his knees to look for a dime ?
Green was much worse .
She once spent half a night searching her carriage for a lost stamp worth two cents .
She wore only one black dress , never used hot water and only ate pies worth fifteen cents .
But here ’s the kicker : when her son Ned broke his leg as a child , Green tried to get him into a charity hospital ward .
When they recognized her , she vowed to treat the leg herself .
Ned eventually contracted gangrene , and he had to get his legs amputated .
To be fair , in her old age , Green began to suffer from hernia , but refused a $ 150 operation for herself .
When she found out cancer could have been cured for $ 20 , she turned down the research team .
Scrooge Rating ( out of 10 )
While all this made Guinness name her “ World ’s Greatest Miser ” , we ca n’t help but sympathize that she was a dick to herself too .
1 ) J. Paul Getty
Douchebag
His Riches
During his lifetime , he was named the richest living American , owning over 200 business , and worth $ 7.5 billion in today ’s dollar ; making him the 67th richest American ever .
His Scroogyness
Getty installed a payphone in his house .
No , in his mansion .
In his 700 + acre plot of land .
Getty placed dial - locks on all his regular phones , limiting their use to people he authorized ( himself ) so that everyone else had to use the payphone : his staff , his business managers , his guests .
But his nature only really came out when his grandson , J. Paul Getty III was kidnapped .
His kidnappers asked for a ransom of $ 17 million , and Getty refused .
Fair enough , no negotiating with terrorists and so on .
But that was n’t his reason for saying no , Getty “ suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather ” .
When the family eventually received Getty III ’s ear in an envelope , they agreed to the new ransom of $ 3.2 million .
Still unhappy , Getty negotiated it down to $ 2 million , and charged his son ( Getty III ’s father ) for the sum , at 4 % interest .
Scrooge Rating ( out of 10 )
Kind of a massive dick move by Getty regarding his grandson .
Getty III was eventually returned , but affected by the trauma , became a drug addict .
The drugs eventually rendered him speechless , blind and paralyzed .
Thanks grandpa .
Peter ,
They were both 14 " pizzas , but the first one stuck to the peel a little bit so it came out a little ovular .
I did count somewhere near 50 , but I did weigh the container of pepperoni before and after and came up with 2.9 oz .
I have found that overlapping the pepperoni is the way to get the crispy and almost burnt edges that I like .
They do shrink down significantly , but as I mentioned earlier , they are much thinner than other kinds I have used .
The only thing that bothers me about the oil is that it makes the cheese not brown at all , but as long as I get that crispy pepperoni texture , it 's worth it .
Even with ~ 50 slices of pepperoni though , the oil is no where near the level I 'd get with 20 slices of the grocery store stuff and yes , it is very nice to not have to waste 3 paper towels just to have edible pizza .

A critically - hurt driver sits impaled to his truck by a pole - moments after calmly telling his boss : " I 'm in a spot of bother . "
Jason Ripley , 39 , was speared just inches from his heart when a loose barrier hidden by overgrown bushes bounced on to the bonnet and through his windscreen .
But without a hint of panic , the dad - of - two grabbed his phone , called work and explained his horrific plight to colleagues .
He revealed : " There was seven or eight feet of pole sticking out .
It could have been the adrenaline but I managed to stay calm .
" I told my boss , ' I 've had a bit of an accident ' , or , ' I 'm in a spot of bother ' .
" I do n't think they understood , but something must have clicked because they called me back and I told them , ' I 'm not messing about , I 'm dying ' .
" I did n't pass out .
I do n't know if it was the shock , but I did n't feel any pain .
It was only two or three inches from my heart .
I was just staring at the sky , thinking that 's it , I 'm going to die . "
Jason had been delivering timber to an industrial estate and had fortunately been driving slowly when he struck the loose barrier .
It meant when the five inch thick pole entered him it took the easiest route , pushing his lung to one side .
He ended up pinned against the back of the cab , and the heavy concrete base of the barrier weighing down the end .
Jason 's workmates comforted him while emergency services spent an hour cutting him from the vehicle in Darlington , County Durham .
Forklift truck drivers moved parked cars to allow an air ambulance to land .
He added : " The fireman cut the roof off and started cutting the pole .
That was the worst bit , when they clamped the jaws of the cutters on the pole and it started turning inside me .
" It was strange when I saw it turning , but by that stage I just wanted to get it out of there .
Even when they put me in the helicopter there was still about four feet of pole going through me . "
He began to think about his partner Helen Todd , 38 , and sons Joshua , 19 , and Jay , 11 , adding : " I just remember wanting to speak to my sons for the last time . "
He was flown to hospital and put in a 24 - hour coma while surgeons removed the barrier .
After having a rib removed and two others tied together , he will have a shoulder injury for life but was back at work within months .
Jason released the photos 15 months after the crash to raise money for the Great North Air Ambulance .
ISTANBUL , Turkey —
Iran ’s jails have a notorious reputation for brutal conditions and harsh interrogation methods that include torture .
Now Iranian and international human rights organizations warn that a string of hidden detention sites have been established throughout Tehran and its suburbs by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The disturbing reports come from many of the thousands of Iran ’s opposition supporters who have been arrested in the anti-government demonstrations since the disputed June 12 elections .
Several of those released describe being kept in unimaginable conditions inside industrial containers , storerooms and a former Revolutionary Guard arms factory hastily converted into a prison .
“ They herded us blindfolded into what I thought was a stadium where they beat us solidly for three days and threatened to execute us , ” said one recently released prisoner who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals .
“ They said to us that since we have n’t been registered , officially we do n’t exist . ”
In July , the death of Mohsen Rooholamini , 25 , the son of a prominent conservative , spurred Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to order the closure of Kahrizak detention center and the release of 140 political prisoners from Evin Prison .
“ The main reason behind Khamenei ’s order to close Kahrizak was to prevent Majlis ( Iran ’s parliament ) from doing an investigation on it like it is planning on investigating some detention centers , ” said Mehdi Khalaji , a specialist on Iranian politics at the Washington Institute .
Ayatollah Mehdi Karroubi , the only clerical candidate to participate in the presidential elections , wrote a formal letter of protest to the government ’s intelligence ministry .
“ The security forces commit the most harsh physical and psychological tortures and behavior towards the detainees without taking responsibility for any of their deeds under the name of Islam , ” wrote Karroubi .
Some of the most notorious holding centers are the Gohardasht prison in the satellite town of Karaj and a site simply known as Minus 4 in the basement of the Interior Ministry in central Tehran .
Kazem Jalali , a spokesman for a parliamentary committee investigating prison conditions , announced that he would be seeking access to Minus 4 but it is unclear whether permission was ever granted .
Prison authorities have been known to play hard and fast with visiting parliamentary delegations : Caspian Makan , the boyfriend of killed protester Neda Agha Soltan , was imprisoned for 65 days in a bid to keep him quiet , and he described how his jailers shunted him behind a wall during an external inspection .
Iran ’s most infamous prison , Evin , has been renovated and it appears the conduct of the jailers and interrogators has been moderated .
Instead of beating detainees or hanging them up from the ceiling by their feet , they are now more likely to use psychological operations .
These include de-personalizing prisoners by referring to them by their numbers or telling prisoners that their family members have been arrested and will be tortured .
One detainee described hearing his elderly father being tortured in an adjoining cell while he sat opposite his interrogator , alone and unscathed .
But violence is still common currency in Evin .
Iranian feminist Shadi Sadr described in a radio interview following her escape from Iran earlier this year how she witnessed prison guards beating silent prisoners sitting in a classroom - sized hall .
Whoever cried out in pain would be beaten more harshly , she said .
I was worried when I was arrested by Iranian plainclothes security agents this summer at Tehran airport and taken to Evin Prison ’s Section 209 , a top - secret jail within a top - security jail that is directly controlled by the Intelligence Ministry and beyond the purview of Iran ’s judiciary .
As a foreigner , I was treated relatively well .
My cell was 8 - feet - long by 6 - feet - wide , contained an en-suite bathroom with a showerhead gaping over a Turkish toilet and a ceiling window that allowed natural light in .
Sanitary products and towels were made available after the first week and I was exposed to little physical violence .
Aside from irregular interrogation sessions by day or night and 24 - hour electric light that rendered sleep difficult , there was little psychological torture .
“ What had you thought ?
That we would start pulling out your fingernails ? ” one of my interrogators joked with me during a lull in a session .
Hassan , a young leftist activist who spent time in Evin , has a similar view of the jail .
“ The international community has put so much pressure on Iran that 209 has become a less threatening place , ” he said .
“ They ’ve painted it green , collapsed double isolation cells into larger singles and generally cleaned it up . ”
The Plane Below is the first of several 4th Edition D&D books that delve into a bit more detail on specific planes and the kinds of adventures that can be found within them .
As the title indicates , this one focuses on the Elemental Chaos and everything pertaining to it .
This book is packed full of content , from cover to cover , and unless your game has absolutely nothing to do with the chaotic plane below you will want to give it a look .
If your game strongly favors demons , elementals , the city of brass , or githzerai then this book is a must have .
The Plane Below is about 160 pages deep and contains just under 50 new types of monsters for you to throw at adventurers to murder and startle them .
The book is very clearly , and logically , organized starting with the general features of the Elemental Chaos including at - will rules for mentally influencing the plane ’s instability to attack creatures with motes of earth or fiery energy .
This section reads exactly like the Elemental Chaos chapter from the Manual of the Planes but magnified by four , including various vehicles used to travel the plane from other sources and a few new ones , various weather effects , fantastical terrain features like acidic mires and flowing rivers of earth , and a handful of new hazards that can be found on the plane below .
Next the chapter presents a handful of new skill challenges such as how to bargain with an efreet , reasoning with a Slaad ( it ’s not easy ! ) , and repairing a lightning skiff .
My favorite part of all of the 4E supplemental books has been the Campaign Arcs section where ideas are presented that take you from the heroic tier through paragon and finishing in epic , nearly every single one I read gives me a handful of new ideas to apply to my own game .
This book is no exception , presenting a variety of arcs to include elemental creatures and even one that focuses on planar characters that start their adventuring lives in the Elemental Chaos .
Next they present a handful of varying level adventure ideas building on the same themes as the campaign arcs .
Several potential patron NPCs are detailed as well as some “ Orders out of Chaos ” like the Cult of the Elemental Eye which are just as interesting to me as the full campaign arcs because they provide lore the players can learn , information just for the DM , organization of the orders , history , goals and methods , and adventure ideas for each of the groups .
The chapter ends with three new artifacts for paragon and epic characters that can bring even more elemental themes into your game and directly into a player ’s hands .
The next chapter provides at least one or two pages on several of the Races of Chaos , including archons , djinns , efreets , genasi , giants and titans , githzerai , and slaads .
I found this chapter to be one of the highlights of the book , making me feel like I was reading an encyclopedia about an actual place and all of the denizens within .
Each entry lists several major sites or locations that relate directly to each race that give a DM plenty of fodder for creating a lot of interesting adventures .
The chapter is also riff with sidebars detailing things such as the debated origins of the genasi and the fact that despite conventional belief there are some primordials that still roam free .
The third chapter devotes two pages each to a selection of specific Elemental Locales that give you even more interesting places to set the scenes of your game .
Some of them are specific locations like a bog , a palace , or a city while others are closer to features like the Pillars of Creation that descend to the unreachable foundations of existence and up to the foundation of the material world .
The Riverweb is a series of floating and intersecting rivers that allow normal seafairing vessels to reach different locations within the Elemental Chaos .
There are several pieces of this book that really stood out to me because they present an element that is not fully explained or left completely mysterious , such as the Pandemonium Stone which is a giant rocky spire that randomly appears and disappears through the plane below , slaads flock to it and two cities of permanent residents somehow always reside on it but the details of its true purpose or where it goes to are not given .
The next piece like this that caught my attention is one of the few adventures in the book , The Body Luminous which involves a roving lightning storm that travels through the Elemental Chaos and has a fossil and relic encrusted core that is unexplained and mysteriously sought by many people and types of creatures .
A lot of the fluff presented for these elements is truly inspiring and causes me to think about potential tie ins for my own campaign .
The next chapter is titled Into the Abyss , so you can pretty easily guess what it is about .
This section , much like the rest of The Plane Below book in relation to the Elemental Chaos , goes into great detail on the Abyss itself .
I was thrilled to see a few more campaign arcs presented specifically for Abyssal adventures detailing only the paragon and epic tiers .
Along with some adventure ideas for several levels , there are four skill challenges in the book specifically geared towards the Abyss and the types of challenges players will face there like how to navigate the dangers of the demonweb .
Several truly terrifying abyssal locations are detailed like Molor , the Stinking Realm and the Plains of Rust which both sound like nice places for any character to vacation .
A very nice touch on Wizard ’s part was to include a couple of encounter groups of various levels that might be found in each location , giving DMs an easy start at adding these locations into their adventures .
Creatures of Chaos is the fifth chapter which provides DMs with a slew of new baddies to use and characters a lot of new things to be truly scared of .
The Primeval Ooze and aptly named Storm That Walks begin the chapter as two new kinds of abominations , followed by some new archons , demons , and elementals as you would expect to see .
The new varities of Slaad are incredibly cool and in all likelihood absolutely evil for players to deal with .
Afte rthat are the Masters of the Elements characters that include an incredibly enlightened githzerai monk named Liricosa that is hard to find and often does n’t even pay attention when you talk to him .
Sirrajadt , the vengeful storm , is a djinn that is hellbent on getting revenge for the death of most of his kin .
His target ?
Why the gods and all of their followers of course !
This leads me to another theme that is present throughout this book , that of war with the gods .
Many of the patron NPCs and plot ideas in this book involve combating the astral beings and their followers , which no doubt includes a large majority of adventurers out there .
I had n’t really considered it before , but this book turned me on to the idea of how cool it would be to run a game where the characters are actually out to directly combat divine beings and those they influence .
I just ca n’t leave out the last two characters presented in this book , the first of which is Solkara , The Crushing Wave , a gargantuan fish - like primoridal of water ( level 34 solo controller ) that seems absolutely devastating .
While bloodied he gains an aura 10 that causes creatures to treat those squares as if they were underwater .
That should sum it up quite a bit for you , but The Plane Below also gives us stats for some of his preist and cultist followers so he can be used as a continuing theme throughout your campaign .
The last character is Ygorl , lord of entropy , a medium slaad composed of black smoke that is the best known of the slaad lords and he is also known as the “ Bringer of Endings ” .
Guess what he wants to do !
This crazy bugger actually has an aura that gives enemies a bonus to attack rolls but it does make them vulnerable 5 to all damage .
Is n’t that nice ?
Several lower level lackeys are also presented for Ygorl , meaning he too can be a continuing presence ( and no doubt nuisance ) in your campaign .
The best way to describe my overall feelings on The Plane Below : Secrets of the Elemental Chaos is that so far every time I ’ve picked it up read through one part or another I ’ve come away with at least one new idea for my own game .
The icing on the cake is that it acts as a go - to reference for whenever you or another player has a question about anything that relates to the Elemental Chaos .
For me , both of those make the book a must have !
Situation For People Living In DPR Korea
UN Expert Spotlights ‘ Abysmal ’ Human Rights Situation For People Living In DPR Korea
New York , Oct 22 2009 6:10 PM
The human rights situation in the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) remains “ abysmal ” as a result of the repressive nature of the ruling regime , the independent United Nations expert monitoring the situation in the East Asian nation said in his latest report submitted today .
“ The freedoms from want , from fear , from discrimination , from persecution and from exploitation are regrettably transgressed with impunity by those authorities , in an astonishing setting of abuse after abuse , ” said Vitit Muntarbhorn , the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK .
“ They compromise and threaten not only human rights , but also international peace and security , ” Mr. Muntarbhorn said in his report to the General Assembly .
The report noted that almost 9 million people in the DPRK are suffering from food shortages , with the World Food Programme ( WFP ) only able to reach fewer than 2 million of the hungry population due to a shortfall in international aid , which the report said is “ doubtlessly ” influenced by reaction to the Government ’s nuclear and missile tests .
“ Food aid is important , ” Mr. Muntarbhorn told reporters in New York after he addressed the Assembly .
“ It should be supported bearing in mind that food aid also involves monitoring to ensure accountability .
No access , no food . ”
Mr. Muntarbhorn highlighted the fact that the DPRK ’s export trade last year amounted to several billion dollars , and that the country has a greater abundance of natural resources than its neighbour to the south .
“ The country is not poor , and yet the money is not spent on the people , ” he told reporters .
“ People should be entitled to a fair share of the budget , and the benefits from trade in terms of access to sustainable development . ”
Despite various formal guarantees in their Constitution , the people of the DPRK are subject to “ persecution , clampdowns , collective punishment , torture , arbitrary executions , public executions , etc. , ” said the Special Rapporteur .
In addition , the report said that people live in continual fear in a system where citizens are pressured into informing on each other , the State practises extensive surveillance over the population and even officials live in trepidation as their colleagues are encouraged to “ whistleblow ” on one another .
“ Throughout the years , the authorities have bred a culture of mistrust and a policy of divide and rule that permeate families and communities , ” he wrote in the report .
The media is also heavily censored , forming the “ backbone of an enormous propaganda machine , ” the report said , adding that reading books from the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) is punishable as a crime of espionage ; computer ownership and use of the Internet without official permission are forbidden ; and it is prohibited to watch foreign videos .
In his report , the human rights expert makes a number of recommendations to the Government , including measures to ensure effective provision of and access to food in cooperation with UN and other agencies ; to address the fear factor in the country by terminating public executions and abuses against security of the person by means of law reform , clearer instructions to law enforcement agencies to respect human rights , and related capacity - building and monitoring of their work to ensure accountability ; and to institute a democratic process , shifting the military budget to the social sector .
The Rapporteur , who has served in the position since the mandate was established in 2004 , will present his final report of his tenure to the Human Rights Council in 2010 .

When we asked our faithful readers what technological advances had made the biggest difference to their lives , Prospero424 stepped up to the plate to deliver a humdinger : video compression .
To Prospero , MPEG - 4 part 2 compression was " when the internet truly became a viable A/V platform / medium .
This is when storing hours of video that looked good enough to watch and keep became viable to store online locally ( i.e. on your hard disks , not on external discs , etc. ) on personal computers .
No other single aspect of the evolution of entertainment has done more to change how I consume it . "
Let 's rewind the tape a little bit further than that , in order to see the breaking point arrive .
Prospero is correct that video compression has indeed revolutionized entertainment over the past decade , but the technology has a longer history than you might think .
The rise of efficient compression
Intel 's Indeo codec was popular back in the day
The carousel of progress keeps on turning , and today 's compression algorithms are much more effective than older ones .
The Cinepak codec that powered early versions of both QuickTime and Windows Media video formats aimed no higher than getting 320x240 video resolution out of a standard CD - ROM drive , which means cramming 2.2 M bps plus audio and overhead into a 1.2 M bps traffic stream .
Call it 50 percent compression on a good day .
If you never saw a digital video back in the 1990s , you 're not alone .
The files were large and the downloads were slow .
And while the tiny hard drives of the era would have welcomed some video compression with open arms , the other parts of that equation were simply not there ; an Intel 486 or Pentium would grind to a standstill trying to make sense of a simplistic Motion JPEG or MPEG - 1 video , even at very low resolutions .
But better days were just around the corner .
The popular MPEG - 2 standard pretty much destroyed Cinepak , Intel Indeo , and other early codecs in the late 1990s by compressing video streams to as much as 1/30 of the original video size while still maintaining acceptable picture quality .
That 's hefty enough to let that old 1x CD - ROM handle a full , standard - resolution NTSC signal at about 1 M bps .
This is the format used in DVD video , many digital broadcasts , and most online video streams .
MPEG - 2 can present a 1080 p video in a 2 M bps envelope , but with horrible blocking artifacts from all the compression if you take it that far .
These codecs are lossy , which means that you must always balance image quality against file size .
HD video was not exactly what MPEG - 2 was made for .
By the standards of modern hardware , like recent models of Texas Instruments ' OMAP processors and anything from Intel or AMD , MPEG - 2 encoding is a walk in the park .
Newer formats , not so much .
This is why your TiVo box still stores DVR recordings in this age - old format .
A TiVo Series 3 can play H.264 video ( more on those later ) , but does not have the muscle to make its own , so you 're stuck converting your videos elsewhere and sending them back to the TiVo again if you 're hell bent on making the most of your hard drive .
Since MPEG - 2 videos can fill up a DVR in short order , many of us opt to simply hook up an external hard drive to the set - top box instead -— or roll our own home theater systems .
But we would n't use MPEG - 2 for that , now would we ?
And then comes the MPEG - 4 Part 2 format , more commonly known under the names of codec implementations like Xvid , DivX , 3ivx , or the QuickTime 6 version .
Like MPEG - 2 before it , MPEG - 4/2 quickly caught on thanks to another step up in compression quality — the same video at comparable levels of picture quality will use about half the bandwidth of MPEG - 2 when presented with an MPEG - 4 Part 2 codec .
The rise of Xvid , DivX 3.11a , 3ivx , and others came at a time when broadband Internet service was coming into its own in the US , and along with the relentless march of technological advances in fields like hard drive storage and CPU power , digital video took off like a rocket .
File sharing sites like KaZaA , IMesh , and Gnutella made it easy to find and download video files .
The small size and high quality of MPEG - 4 Part 2 codecs made the format perfect for downloading , and the format quickly became ubiquitous .
You could find full movies on file sharing networks before their theatrical premieres , and DVD rips before the discs hit store shelves — all at glorious full NTSC or better display resolutions .
In 2001 , your desktop computer could sport gigahertz bragging rights on a Coppermine Pentium III or Palomino Athlon .
These chips still needed help from your Radeon or GeForce to handle full - screen DVD playback , but they were powerful enough to pick apart MPEG - 2 videos in smaller sizes .
These machines were ready and able to fill up their massive 100GB hard drives with videos .
And the MPEG - 4 Part 2 gravy train kept on rolling for years .
When it comes to video encoders for personal use , it was the king of the hill from the early 2000s , and arguably still is .
This is probably what you 'd use for a hand - rolled media server today , running Windows Media Center , SageTV , Boxee , or MythTV .
MPEG - 4 video is , as Prospero noted , compressed enough to let you store and enjoy media in a plethora of new ways .
Filling up a couple hundred gigabytes of hard drive space takes much longer with efficient compression , and a full - length movie often weighs in at less than 1GB .
That 's a mental barrier for many people , drawing a line in the sand between " huge " and " reasonable " files .
While the Apple iPhone and iPod lines do n't support Divx - compatible formats directly , they can decode the equally efficient recent versions of QuickTime media and there are plenty of converters between the formats .
And I 'm not an iPhone addict , but I bet there 's an app for MPEG - 4 Part 2 playback .
Handheld media gadgets based on Windows Media or Android platforms have their ways of handling high - quality video streams too , which makes them useful for playing your own videos or streaming shows across WiFi or 3G connections .
Mobile video would simply not be possible or palatable if not for compression techniques of the MPEG - 4 magnitude .
But nothing lasts forever .

FRESNO , CA — OK , let ’s talk hardware for once .
I love the hardware , always have ; the reason I do n’t talk much about it is that what we ’ve got is mostly useless , and what we really do need is always getting slammed .
I ’ll give you two examples : the F / A - 18 and the V - 22 .
If you ’re a typical half - baked Tom Clancy fan , you know what to think of both these planes : F / A - 18 good , V - 22 bad .
Wrong on both counts .
In fact , that ’s why it ’s hard to talk hardware , because you have to de-program so much crap from the standard view .
Start with the V - 22 Osprey .
You probably know the basics : it ’s a transport aircraft with engines out on the end of the wings that can rotate forward to fly like a conventional plane and tilt up to vertical ( that ’s what the V is for ) so it can land like a helicopter .
Rotating propellars :
The ultimate insurgent cuisinart !
And everybody knows , or thinks they know , that it ’s a lemon .
It ’s ten years behind schedule ; it keeps crashing ; it ’s already killed more than 50 Marines .
And Dick Cheney hates it .
Back when he was Secretary of Defense , Cheney said the V - 22 was “ … one weapons system I do n’t need . ”
That ’s as good a place as any to start your deprogramming : whatever Dick Cheney says , think the opposite .
If Dick Cheney tells you it ’s a sunny day , get your umbrella .
It ’s no surprise to me that Cheney hates this weapons system , because Cheney is , and I ’m kind of half serious here , an Iranian agent who hates America and wants to destroy us .
He ’s all for spending trillions of our tax dollars on absolutely worthless weapons like aircraft carriers , but he fought hard against the Osprey because it ’s the one contemporary weapons system that could have made a difference in Operation Desert One / Eagle Claw , the Iran hostage - rescue attempt back in the days of Reverend Jimmy Carter .
That ’s a good handy test to ask yourself about any weapons system : would it have helped in Desert One ?
That ’s the kind of mission we need to think about : special ops , fast and quiet .
So , would the Osprey have helped ?
Hell yes .
If we ’d had something like it in service , the rescue mission might not have ended so disgustingly .
You probably remember the whole miserable story back in 1980 : we had to use CH - 53 heavy - lift choppers on that raid , even though they ’ve always had a bad rep , and they ’re not designed for transport anyway , let alone high - value , high - risk special operations transport .
By the time they reached their first rendezvous with the USAF ’s C -130 .
Only five of the eight choppers were still working , and the mission was scrubbed .
During takeoff after the scrub , one of the CH - 53s , underpowered and overweight , was blown into a C - 130 .
Kaboom !
Giant fireball , eight men dead , and the next day some greasy mullah had himself photographed holding up a charred American pilot ’s arm .
If you ’re a glutton for pain , you can read the more detailed article I did on it .
Replay that raid with the Osprey as basic transport and you get a very different result .
The Osprey carries 32 troops at a cruising speed of 250 mph ; there ’d be no need to land in the middle of the desert , because it can be refueled air - to - air .
The flight would have landed directly at the staging area near Tehran , without any need to touch down in the desert during a sandstorm .
A fleet of Ospreys instead of CH - 53s would probably have ferried Beckwith ’s guys safely to their staging base outside Tehran .
To be honest , I do n’t think the mission , at least from that point on , ever had a chance ; it was James Bond crap that required this big American force to infiltrate Tehran in trucks and rescue the hostages , then fight its way back to the planes .
It was like some mid- 80s screenplay that would ’ve starred Patrick Swayze .
Nobody would have made it home alive , but at least they would have died killing Revolutionary Guards at a nice , satisfying 20:1 ratio , with our air cover turning Tehran into a toasty lesson on why you should be nice to American diplomats .
There ’s failure and there ’s failure , and with better transport this could ’ve been a glorious failure instead of a painful ( really painful , I remember ! ) joke .
Suppose the Osprey really is n’t a very safe aircraft .
That ’s the knock on it , after all .
Well , the hard answer here is , so what ?
It ’s a revolutionary advance in exactly the kind of war we actually need to learn how to fight .
If that costs a few lives along the way , so be it .
The question nobody bothers asking is whether the lives lost on a particular aircraft are worth it or not .
So if you have , say , an unsafe carrier - based fighter , then to me that clunker ’s not worth one American life , because it ’s useless .
Its whole existence is a waste of lives and money .
But if you have a VTOL special ops transport that gets your guys in and out twice as fast , with no clumsy refueling stops , then it ’s worth the lives spent to learn how to make it mechanically reliable .
God knows we ’ve lost a lot more guys in less worthwhile ways .
Try thinking like the enemy .
Would Al Qaeda hesitate if it had a flight of Ospreys that could land near Capitol Hill , even if their head maintenance guys told them that , say , one - third of the planes were going to crash before they got to the target ?
Nope .
If the mission is that important , and the Osprey is designed for exactly the most important missions we ’ve got , then you can live with losses .
Besides , I ’m not convinced the Osprey ’s really that unreliable .
There have only been four major crashes , and for such a revolutionary design that ’s not bad .
Compare that to the really scary record of the F - 18 variants we sold to the Aussies : four of the 71 they bought have crashed already , but nobody ’s panicking about that .
So why does the Osprey get so much bad - mouthing ?
The F - 18 after colliding with a bird : “ Yeah , but
you shoulda seen what that seagull looks like ! ”
Before you let me answer for you , let ’s give you a lesson in thinking hard about hardware .
You tell me , why would the Air Force , the Navy and the Army hate a weapons system like this one ?
Remember , we ’re talking about jealous branches of the Armed Services , we ’re talking about billions of dollars , we ’re talking about a world where an Air Force general takes off his uniform and gets a lobbying job without even blinking .
And keep in mind that each one of the Armed Services will do anything to keep from losing money to the others .
I bet you got it by now .
The Osprey is a Marine Corps project .
This should be the last clue you need : what makes the Corps different from all the other services ?
Answer : because it has its own air wing , and this USMC air wing is the only American force that ’s allowed to operate fixed - wing aircraft , helicopters , or mutants like the V - 22 ; all the other services have to stick to one or the other kind of aircraft .
The Army is limited by law to helicopters and the Air Force has a monopoly of fixed ( or swept - ) wing craft .
So a plane like the Osprey , that can turn from one to the other in a few seconds , is about as welcome as a sneezing duck on a trans -Pacific flight from Hong Kong .
Defense appropriations are an annual turf war between the services , and the Osprey does n’t even have any identifiable turf .
It ’s a bird , it ’s a plane , it ’s a procurement officer ’s worst nightmare !
It threatens the whole paranoid truce between the three big services about who owns what .
The fact that the V - 22 might actually help us fight irregular wars like the ones we actually need to plan for does n’t figure at all .
They ’d laugh at you if you brought that up .
It ’d just prove that “ you do n’t get it . ”
To them , this is like an advertising campaign .
They want to sell programs to Congress so they can buy another condo in Costa Rica .
Congressman plays with an F18 model before voting .
I ’ve actually read proud stories of big sales by lobbyists .
They actually brag about robbing us .
They sold the F - 22 Raptor by dazzling Congress with all this Knightrider dashboard crap .
The reason they had to switch sales pitches is because they were having a problem using their old approach : the Soviet threat .
Somebody asked the annoying question , “ Uh …what Soviets ?
Did n’t they kinda go outta business ? ”
So the lobbyists actually ran a campaign called “ Save the Raptor ” — like it was some Sierra Club bird watcher ’s PBS documentary call - in show .
And , would n’t you know it , they saved the Raptor !
Nobody knows what the Raptor ’s good for , unless all our F - 15 squadrons suddenly come under the control of the Hypno - toad and have to be knocked out of the sky by an “ even more advanced ! ” fighter .
They won , the sales pitch worked .
Maybe they can even come up with a civilian version of the Raptor , sell one to Ah - nold at a discount , make a killing with the street - racer crowd .
It ’d probably be pretty good at that .
But it sure is n’t any use in a war like Iraq or any other war we ’re going to be fighting on this planet .
But do n’t expect Cheney or any of his pals to say so .
The only weapons systems they hate are the ones like the Osprey , hardware that actually might help us fight and win irregular wars .
In case this sounds harsh , let ’s talk about another weapons system , one that Tom Clancy just loves , the f ucking moron : the F / A - 18 Hornet .
I happen to know everything there is to know about how this clunker came into service , because my baptism of fire as a hardware war nerd was the Lightweight Fighter Program , the big showdown between two contenders for a smaller , cheaper fighter to complement the F - 15 .
I was still in grade school , and a lot of the technical stuff was over my head , but by reading everything the library had , every issue of Armed Forces Journal and Aviation Week , I got the main line of the story .
The idea behind the Lightweight Fighter was that , in an all - out air war against the Warsaw Pact , we ’d lose a lot of planes , so we needed a HiLo mix of expensive high - altitude air - superiority fighters like the F - 15 and F - 14 and cheaper , lighter planes that could match the dogfighting agility of the MiG - 21 .
We were overrating the MiG - 21 , as it turned out , but at the time everybody took it real seriously .
Why not ?
There was no money in admitting the MiG - 21 was a flying Yugo .
Totally inferior to the earlier MiG designs .
It was supposed to be a lean , mean killer and we needed something to match .
Of course the F - 4 Phantom was part of the problem .
It was lousy in dogfights over North Vietnam , because it handled like a SCUD , an interceptor pushed into duty as a dogfighter .
The USAF had been pushed into accepting the F - 4 , a Navy carrier - based design , and hated it .
One outcome was the Top Gun schools to re-train pilots to stick and move ; the other was the Lightweight Fighter Program , which was supposed to give them a fighter that could play bumper - cars instead of just drag racing .
There were five entries , but it soon came down to two contenders : the General Dynamics YF - 16 and the Northrop YF - 17 .
Both services , the USAF and the Navy , had agreed to buy the winning design .
And it was pretty clear , even to a naive kid like me , that General Dynamics was the winning team this time .
I knew how to read between the lines from being a big Oakland Raiders fan : I knew what the writers were saying in that careful language they used .
And they were saying Northrop ’s design was a dog , but GD ’s was amazing .
Nobody much liked GD back then , because the F - 111 fighter - bomber had a bad rep , but their F - 16 prototype outflew the Northrop contender every time .
It was more mobile at high speed , and it even cost less : $ 4.6 million per copy , vs. $ 5 million for the Northrop .
In 1975 it was officially announced as the winner .
And that ’s when things got weird .
At the time I just did n’t understand what happened .
Too young and dumb , too trusting –like most war nerds are even today .
First big shock was that the Navy went back on the deal , announced it would n’t buy the F - 16 and was going to adopt a modified version of the F - 17 .
The official reason was that the F - 16 had only one engine , and the Navy had always had double - engine fighters .
The Northrop design , the YF - 17 , was a twin -engine .
But that two - engine story was actually a lie that the Navy figured was simple enough for Congress to understand .
I remember hearing the same story from my uncle , who dived for abalone on weekends in this crappy old boat with double inboards .
My dad would just nod while my uncle went on about how you had to have two engines , one just was n’t safe … and then when we were back in the car heading home , my dad would explain that was a lot of nonsense that dated from the days when marine engines were so hopeless you had to have a spare if you wanted to stay off the rocks .
Any decent modern diesel would do you fine .
And when you consider that the F - 16’s engine was none other than the Pratt & Whitney F - 100 , the same beautiful machine that powered the F - 15 , the double - engine story sounds pretty feeble .
The F / A - 18 ’s GE F - 404 never had , and never will have , the same legendary rep as the P&W F - 100 .
In fact , they had to do endless modifications just to get the thing to work .
The real reason the Navy did n’t want the F - 16 was that the USAF was going to be using it .
Even though they ’d stuck the USAF with the F - 4 , they were n’t going to take their promised turn making the big adjustment .
The Navy did n’t really think much of the Northrop YF - 17 , but they liked the fact that it would be all theirs .
And to show that they were calling the shots , the Navy went and did the ultimate betrayal : they bought the Northrop design , and then froze Northrop itself out of the development process , the whole long , profitable business of converting the YF - 17 into a carrier - based airplane that eventually became the F / A - 18 .
They handed over the whole program to a contractor they liked better , McDonnell Douglas .
The reason the Navy would n’t let Northrop handle the program goes all the way back to the 1940s , when these companies were still run by the guys they ’re named after .
Northrop was the property of John Knudsen Northrop , who had earned the total , eternal hate of the Navy by daring to tell Congress that we did n’t need aircraft carriers any more .
That ’s the one thing you do n’t ever tell the Navy , even though everybody knows it ’s true .
Northrop was just trying to sell his weird “ flying wing ” designs when he made that crack about the carriers , but the damage was done .
Thirty years later , the Navy brass got its revenge by taking Northrop ’s F - 17 away and making it the McDonnell Douglas F/ A - 18 .
It was n’t a very good design then , and it is n’t now .
The F - 16 has had a totally brilliant career , proved itself in air superiority and ground attack versions .
The F / A - 18 clunks along thanks to great pilots and a lot of cash , but it ’s just not that great an airframe .
The only reason the F / A - 18 exists is to be put on aircraft carriers .
Which brings us back to what Jack Northrop said more than fifty years ago : why do we need aircraft carriers ?
If you look hard at the Navy ’s weird little dance after the Lightweight Fighter Program , what you see is a mediocre plane that never should have been funded , sitting on the decks of the most expensive , useless and vulnerable warships ever built .
When we scrambled F / A - 18s to intercept old Soviet Tu-95s that were photographing the USS Nimitz in the Pacific last week ( Feb. 11 ) , the whole farce got me down .
Here ’s a couple of rusty , slow , hopelessly obsolete 55 - year - old Soviet bombers pretending to threaten a US aircraft carrier that ’s just as obsolete as they are .
Every ham actor in that little drama should have retired long ago ; it was like watching a fight between a couple of old heavyweights who should be enjoying their golden years in a wheelchair but keep getting trotted out because Don King knows how gullible we all are .
The Russians can get better pictures from their satellites than the poor old Tu-95s got ; the Nimitz is a worthless target anyway , designed to fight WW II ; and the F - 18 that intercepted it only exists because the Navy turned down a superior plane , the F - 16 , for reasons that would have embarrassed a fourth grader .
And yet it ’s the V - 22 Osprey that gets all the bad press .
Jeez .
It ’s not the hardware I mind , it ’s the rusty Cold War software in the heads of the guys who like to talk about it .

The US targeted a senior al Qaeda leader and brother - in - law of Osama bin Laden during Thursday ’s swarm attack in Pakistan ’s Taliban - controlled tribal agency of North Waziristan .
The US believed Sheikh Saeed al Saudi was scheduled to attend a high - level al Qaeda meeting in the Datta Khel region in North Waziristan , The News reported .
The nature of the strike indicates the US was targeting a high - value target .
Up to seven unmanned US Predator and Reaper strike aircraft converged on the target and launched up to 10 missiles .
Sixteen al Qaeda and Haqqani network fighters were reported killed in the attack .
Sheikh Saeed al Saudi is married to bin Laden ’s sister and serves on al Qaeda ’s Shura Majlis , or executive council , a senior US intelligence official told The Long War Journal .
The official also confirmed that al Saudi was the target of the attack .
Al Saudi also is involved in al Qaeda ’s “ financial activities , ” the official said .
Al Saudi is thought to have survived the strike , but the US believes it killed Zuhaib al Zahibi , a general officer in al Qaeda ’s Shadow Army , or the Lashkar al Zil .
The Taliban have denied that senior al Qaeda leaders were killed in the strike .
The Datta Khel region in South Waziristan borders the Jani Khel region in the settled district of Bannu .
Jani Khel has long been a strategic meeting place and safe haven for al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Jani Khel was identified as the headquarters for al Qaeda ’s Shura Majlis back in 2007 .
Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command , has operated in the Jani Khel region .
The US has struck al Qaeda safe houses in Jani Khel twice since last year .
These strikes are the only two Predator attacks that have occurred outside of Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
The town of Jani Khel is a known haven for al Qaeda leaders and fighters .
Senior al Qaeda operative Abdullah Azzam al Saudi was killed in a Predator strike in Jani Khel on Nov. 19 , 2008 .
Azzam served as a liaison between al Qaeda and the Taliban operating in Pakistan ’s northwest .
Al Qaeda is known to have deposited its donations received from Europe into the Bayt al Mal , or Bank of Money , in Jani Khel , according to a report at the NEFA Foundation .
The Bayt al Mal served as al Qaeda ’s treasury .
“ The money can only be released on Osama bin Laden ’s direction , and when such an order is given , it is Mustafa Abu Yazid who executes it , ” the NEFA Foundation report said .
Yazid , who is also known as Sheikh Saeed al Masri , is the leader of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and also serves as the group ’s chief financial operative .

President Obama is taking a sharp , populist tone with Wall Street and scolding the ways of Washington as he once again looks to the Senate to follow the House and pass one of his top legislative priorities : sweeping financial regulatory reform .
It might feel satisfying to hear the President criticize “ reckless ” , “ fat cat ” bankers , but the financial reform legislation passed by the House last Friday ( and lauded by the President ) provides little incentive to change their behavior .
In reality populism , with nothing of substance behind it , is just cynical posturing designed to mask genuine failure .
Like everything else with this President , he is again showing himself to be ( to use an expression of his predecessor ) , all hat , no cattle .
Appealing to the peanut gallery at this stage is an insult to the voters ’ intelligence .
The current bill is yet another in a series of major disappointments .
The most telling comment on the latest reforms came from the stock market : Bank stocks ended the day higher last Friday ( when the House bill was passed to great fanfare ) , with the KBW Banks index slightly outperforming the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average .
At its most basic level , a bank is an entity that has a reserve account at the Fed , which makes loans and takes deposits .
That is its primary public purpose , and we should not be allowing activities which undermine this central function , especially seeing as it is the government which guarantees the public ’s deposits via the FDIC .
( As an aside , even though the government creates all reserves and guarantees deposits , we do not want it to be directing lending activity because , as “ Winterspeak ” notes :
“ we do not want the Government to make credit decisions , they are too likely to dole out money to politically connected constituencies , while starving worthwhile , but unconnected borrowers ”
However good the political optics of resorting to name - calling and demonization of Wall Street , the legislation itself does nothing to recognize that the behavior criticized is a direct consequence of incentives built into the current institutional structure .
It completely misses the point because it does nothing to ban activities which were at the heart of the crisis and which will likely be perpetuated as a consequence of the new legislation .
All the new legislation does is institutionalize tax payer bailouts and , in so doing , continues the process of privatizing profits and socializing losses .
There is no attempt to ban activities that were central to this crisis .
The problem is that insolvent institutions have a habit of “ betting the bank ” through control fraud and the new legislation will not prevent this .
Even positive aspects of the bill , such as the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency , were significantly watered down .
New Democrats – the people we used to call “ Republicans ” – won concessions that give federal regulators more scope to preempt state consumer - protection laws deemed to “ significantly interfere with or materially impair a national bank ’s ability to do business . ”
The change was sponsored by Congresswoman Melissa Bean , who is the most bought and paid for member ( by bankers ) in the House , not an inconsiderable political achievement amongst our current political profiles in courage in Congress .
Bean justified the change on the basis of having , “ robust national standards and enforcing them uniformly ” , which sounds good until one considers the history of federal regulators , none of whom have historically moved when they plainly should have done so .
How many federal regulators do you recall actually blocking the most egregious excesses in the mortgage market over the past 15 years ?
Preventing the states from moving proactively means that we will likely repeat the experience of the 1990s .
Historically , the reform impetus has emanated from the states , not the Federal Government , Governor Eliot Spitzer ’s administration being a prominent illustration .
More and more voters are beginning to believe this façade of reform is deliberate – a cynical act of kabuki theater by the President to mask his own reticence to deal with the problem in an honest manner .
It was clear to many of us that the President may not have been serious about reform when he picked Tim Geithner and Larry Summers as the leaders of his economic team a year ago , and essentially relegated any genuine progressive to the Cabinet equivalent of Siberia , as Matt Taibbi recently highlighted .
Yes , Summers and Geithner both have ample experience : but does that mean that they were qualified to take on the positions they were granted in the Administration ?
I suppose that depends on whether you think a doctor who botched your surgery ought to be given the role for the next one , simply because he has greater familiarity with your body than another surgeon .
Some on the left have attacked Taibbi very hard for the attacks on Obama , and Matt is no conservative .
More importantly , he is correct : Taibbi calls the President for what he is , a sweet talking man who cannot fulfill one single promise he made to the public to get elected .
So we have this incompetent financial reform bill , which will not place any limits on another systematic collapse .
We have a health bill with no means of sensibly restraining cost pressures within the private health insurance industry .
We are still fighting two wars , one of which is being escalated .
The economy is still struggling and jobs are being lost .
Far easier to resort to cheap populism than actually do something about it .
If the President were serious , he would be pointing out that the bankers have been undercutting every effort at reform , and have been paying off Congress to put loopholes into all legislation .
If he were genuinely upset , he would be channeling the country ’s anger constructively , by calling on the population to take to the streets in mass protests against Wall St. , with a view to shutting down the biggest banks and breaking their power once and for all .
Of course , the President would never do anything so “ irresponsible ” .
Far better to throw a few bones to the peasants and hope that the appearance of reform pacifies them .
The economist Hyman Minsky argued that the Great Depression represented a failure of the small - government , laissez - faire economic model , while the New Deal promoted a Big Government / Big Bank highly successful model for capitalism .
The current crisis just as convincingly represents a failure of the Big Government / Crony Capitalist model that promotes deregulation , reduced oversight , privatization , and consolidation of market power .
Yet the very people , who have shredded the New Deal reforms and replaced them with self - supervision of markets , are the champions of today ’s financial “ reform ” .
As appealing as the story of Paul on the road to Damascus might , there is no certainly no evidence of any Damascene conversion here amongst the policy makers of the Obama Administration .
It ’s business as usual , along with the championing of monetary and fiscal policy that is biased against maintenance of full employment and adequate growth to generate rising living standards for most Americans .
We must return to a more sensible model , with enhanced supervision of financial institutions and with a financial structure that promotes stability by aligning the banks ’ activities with public purpose , rather than abetting speculation and then bailing the financial sector out after the fact .
If banks want to blow themselves up , that ’s fine , but not with taxpayers ’ money or taxpayer guaranteed deposits .
President Roosevelt proved that we could reform the financial system , rescue homeowners , and deal with the unemployed even as we mobilized and then fought World War II .
By contrast , this is an Administration that defines reform as muddled compromise within a profoundly broken polity .
Perhaps because of the fact that many of the top draft picks for the Stars in recent years are playing with the team ( and possibly due to certain draft choices ) , the Stars are rated towards the bottom of the NHL when it comes to their level of prospects .
A lot of the focus on the Dallas Stars ' farm system and their prospects has been centered around Ivan Vishnevskiy , Scott Glennie and up until just a few months ago , Jamie Benn .
Yet despite the lack of flashy talent or big names in the system , there are a number of players whom Stars fans should feel excited about as they move towards taking the next step into the AHL and beyond .
Matt Tassone is one of those players .
He 's not the flashiest forward or the most high - profile but his leadership , determination and hard - working style have set him apart from the other prospects starting as soon as he was drafted .
In his fourth season with the Swift Current Broncos , he is working hard to recover from injury and surgery setbacks that derailed an incredible 2008 - 09 season .
After breaking out with 55 points in just 52 games , Tassone injured his shoulders and required season - ending surgery .
It was a tough end to the year for the player named team MVP , and his absence was sorely felt as the Broncos dropped their first round playoff series in four games .
This season , with Tassone fighting back after a near - ten month absence , the Broncos are in a fight for a playoff spot .
Over the weekend , Swift Current dropped two tough games with one game including a rare hour - long delay in the second intermission because of a power outage .
While speaking with Defending Big D on Monday , Tassone talked about the difficulty of playing in such an odd and frustrating game .
" We were talking about that happened with the New Jersey game and how that game was ended .
But that 's obviously some weird circumstances , it 's never happened before .
It was kind of hard to picture yourself getting back into it .
" We were down 3 - 2 and we had the momentum going and then the lights go out .
You 're just sitting around not knowing if you 're playing or not .
It 's kinda like we lost two times .
We were down and then we played that period and we lost that last period .
It was a mental game really , in the third period there .
And we could n't pull that one out . "
This season has been a long , hard road for Tassone as he fought to return from surgery on both shoulders .
A labrum tear in his left shoulder was repaired , but his right required complete reconstructive surgery .
A long recovery process for anyone , yet Tassone suffered a devastating setback when an infection required the surgery to be performed again .
This second surgery moved his window for return back another six months .
While Tassone 's competitiveness urged him back onto the ice , he was focused on being patient with his rehabilitation .
Yet that patience was tough to come by .
" That 's the longest I 've ever been out ; I was out for ten months .
You know , cutting my season short , getting ready for the new season and missing camp and not being there , it was tough .
I really did n't want to rush it , I talked to a lot of guys , I talked to other hockey players who play the pro game and had the shoulder surgery before , talked to my doctor and my dad , he helps me a lot . "
" One of the big things I did n't want to do is rush my shoulders back and being out of the game that long , obviously I 'm a competitor and I like competing .
It was tough , some nights it was really tough .
But I knew that if I waited then my shoulders would be better than ever , stronger than ever and I really wanted to wait my time and make sure my shoulders were 110 % . "
Tassone credits a lot his determination and competitiveness to his father , who guided him as he grew up playing hockey in St. Albert , Alberta , near Edmonton .
" Probably my biggest influence is my dad .
He never played hockey but he knows a lot about the game and he 's probably been the guy , you know , always was with me at the rink .
and if I ever needed anything he was always there . "
Despite raising his son as an Oilers fan , it seems his father must have known something about Tassone 's future as a hockey player .
" I grew up an Oilers fan , but my first NHL jersey was actually a Mike Modano jersey , a Dallas Stars Modano jersey .
I do n't know why , but my dad got me a Modano jersey when I was six year 's old for Christmas .
I think it 's kind of ironic ; I did n't even have an Oilers jersey until a couple years later . "
When asked if he then became a closet Stars fan living in Edmonton , Tassone chuckles .
" You know I kind of was .
You know they had that big rivalry and they always played each other in the playoffs and stuff like that and my dad always got us tickets .
So I have watched the Stars for actually a while now , and I was just thrilled when I got drafted by them . "
Tassone was drafted in the 6th round of the 2008 NHL Entry draft by the Stars , after his second season with Swift Current .
At the time , he was known primarily as a hard - working , physical forward who had flashed some offensive potential at times .
Yet it was n't until the season after he was drafted that Tassone truly broke out , scoring 36 goals and finishing with a +23 before his shoulder injuries , a scoring potential that he says he always had .
" I actually have always been a scorer in my background , in bantam and midget .
I was always top two , or the top scorer on my team , ever since I was a little kid .
Just playing , gradually getting to know the league better and finally I just kind of broke out .
I do practice my touch around the net , ever since I came into the juniors .
In the summer I like to work on honing my skills .
Even this past summer , I wanted to make sure I was back at it , getting a feel for the puck again .
I do practice a lot over the summer on my scoring touch , and I think that 's what helped me a lot to break out last season . "
The hard work that Tassone put in through his recovery and rehab have started to pay off the past month , after finally returning to game action in December .
It was a slow start , but it was expected .
" I obviously knew , being out for ten months , I was n't going to be .... You lose kinda of that touch around the net , and one thing I did want to do when I came back was just kinda work hard and make sure to put my time in the gym and on the ice , just kinda be a hard - nosed guy .
" I knew when I came back I was n't going to be the same player that I was .
I feel like the last month and a half I 've been getting lots of chances , I 've been putting the puck in the net and I feel like my game is getting closer and closer to where I was last season . "
" I'm a hard - nosed , power forward that can put the puck in the net ; I have that skill set .
I 'm just a hard working player .
I bring leadership to a team and I 've always been a leader on the teams I 've played on , I 've always had a letter on my chest .
I think that 's something I pride myself on , I 'm a good leader and I like to show by example .
I like to take games under my belt and do what I need to do to help the team win . "
It 's that desire to win , that inherent leadership and physical ability that led the Stars to draft Tassone in 2008 .
Yet it was Les Jackson and Brett Hull who drafted him , when the organization was focused on a certain skill set in their forwards .
Under Joe Nieuwendyk , the Stars have shifted a bit as they target smaller , speedier centers and wingers who are primarily playmakers .
Despite the change in the front office and in the coaching staff of the NHL team , Tassone says that he 's been encouraged by the organization to keep doing what he does best .
While recovering from his shoulder surgeries back home in Edmonton , Tassone even received that reassurance in person at a Stars and Oilers game .
" I was at home in Edmonton earlier in the year and I got to see the Stars play the Oilers one night and I actually went to the game and met everybody .
It was great . "
And he's not thinking about the change in playoff philosophy in the team .
" I 'm just doing what I 'm doing which is playing hard nosed hockey .
I 'm playing my game and they said they liked that and I 'm just going to kind of keep to it . "
The Stars keep in touch though as Tassone is acquainted with the Stars ' past , with both former players and coaches .
" [ Stars scout ]
Shane Churla comes down here , he lives closeby , so he sometimes talks to me and asks how I 'm doing .
I am fortunate enough to have Mark Lamb as my coach this year , and he's on good terms with the Dallas organization .
He helps me out a lot . "
As with every prospect , the Stars have worked with Tassone on improving certain aspects of his game .
Like with many young players , it was the skating that was singled out .
" I think that 's what I needed to work on the most ; I can always get faster and that 's what I needed to do .
They told me to just keep working hard . "
Of course , as a player known for his physicality and willingness to drop the gloves , it helps to have a scout like Shane Churla working closely with you .
Unfortunately , there have n't been any fighting tips just yet .
" No tips yet .
This year I 've been a bit tentative to do it ( fight ) , but no tips from Churla yet .
I recently had a fight and it was a good test for my shoulders .
If the opportunity is there I will jump in and drop the gloves , but no , he has n't shown me anything yet . "
With just a few months remaining in Tassone 's fourth season with Swift Current ( he 'll be 21 in September ) , the next step in his playing career is looming on the horizon .
Yet with the AHL definitely in the near future , he says his focus is squarely on getting his current team into the playoffs .
" I do n't want to focus my mind on that 100 % just yet .
I want to live in the now , do good in the playoffs .
But I do think about my future , and what my future is in hockey .
My goal is the NHL and that 's where I want to go .
But for right now I just want to focus on the Swift Current and making the playoffs and having a good playoff run .
But hopefully I 'll make that jump soon . "
" We have 22 games left and we 're two points out of a playoff spot , just trying to make a push and play smart hockey .
Make simple plays and sometimes we try and get too dynamic , but we just have to play tough .
It 's starts from the goaltending out : good goaltending , good defense and good forwards .
We have been playing good hockey lately , but we 've been digging ourselves a hole with puck giveaways and things like that .
We just have to clean up our game and we 'll be good to go . "
Matt Tassone is one of those rare , highly skilled players who 's head in undoubtedly in the right place .
When talking with the young player it was apparent that he was hesitant to talk about his future in the AHL and beyond , and was much more focused on his current team and where they are headed this season .
The Swift Current Broncos were just a few points back of the eighth place team in their conference and were looking to rebound after some tough losses .
Like the Stars , the Broncos have a tough road ahead but not an impossible one .
With Tassone back on the ice and finally feeling comfortable after ten months away from his team , there 's no doubt that he 'll do whatever it takes to help his team win .
He 's a player that will not hesitate to come to the aid of a teammate , to protect others around him with big hits or to send a message with a punishing fight .
With his scoring ability growing and his offensive potential still untapped , Tassone is on the fast track to becoming not only an important part of his future AHL teams but could potentially be an important asset for the Stars down the road .
There 's no doubt about what led Les Jackson to draft Tassone in 2008 , and those qualities still hold true today .
" They liked me , " Tassone says , " because I like to compete and I just want to win .
I 've just got to keep that emotion . "

Looking for live updates and information on getting to Hullabalou ?
Visit Louisville.com 's HullabaLOU roundup page .
When I first heard that Churchill Downs was hosting HullabaLOU Music Festival July 23 - 25 , my immediate reaction was to contact the folks I went to Bonnaroo with this year and see if they wanted to go .
Then I read the festival 's lineup .
As Louey Ville posted on her blog , " You 've gotta wonder who these folks consulted with when planning this festival .
"
Not only did I not see any act that appealed , but if I did , I probably would n't want to admit it to my friends .
( And , as Churchill Downs 's homepage makes no mention of HullabaLOU , you can't help but wonder if someone there is embarrassed about the lineup too . )
If you are interested in attending HullabaLOU , tickets go on sale today at noon at Ticketmaster .
It does n't sound like Derby City Espresso will be going though : " $ 169 for this crap ???
COUNT ME OUT , " it Tweeted .
The racetrack can accommodate 160,000 fans at HullabLOU , so clearly Churchill Downs Entertainment ( CDE ) is banking on people traveling to Louisville .
But the festival 's three headliners -- Bon Jovi , Kenny Chesney and Dave Matthews Band - - tour regularly .
Is anyone but their most hardcore fans going to travel here to see them perform when they probably caught one of their shows a few months earlier in their hometown ?
And does Louisville really want an influx of hardcore Bon Jovi fans , assuming any exist ?
While the headliners are big - enough names , none of them come across as a popular draw for festival crowds .
Bon Jovi and Kenny Chesney , for example , are big with white women in their 30s and 40s ; a demographic better known for liking nice meals and spa treatments than traveling to music festivals .
The kids wo n't be coming out for this one : " I love Louisville but this is pathetic , " Tweeted 21 - year - old Jiggle Billy shortly after HullabaLOU was announced .
It seems as if the promoters saw that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and Phish headlined last year 's Bonnaroo and set out to find an act from Jersey and a jam band to front HullabaLOU .
But Bon Jovi ai n't Springsteen and the constantly touring DMB ain't a just reunited Phish - - ticket sales probably will make the difference clear to Churchill Downs Entertainment ( CDE ) , the event 's producer .
( But props to the promoters for at least effectively mimicking Bonnaroo 's name . )
The supporting acts , however , is where the lineup falls apart : it 's heavy on came - and - went performers rather than up - and - coming ones .
The Doobie Brothers , Steppenwolf , the Steve Miller Band , Kansas and 38 Special have me wondering if CDE 's booker recently got thawed out after having been frozen since 1979 .
As for Richard Marx to use ESPN 's Bill " Sports Guy " Simmons 's catchphrase , " He was still available ?
" The lineup has Erin Keane wondering " Will there be a halfway to HullabaLOU show ?
Featuring Hall & Oates , Al Jarreau and the Spin Doctors ? "
And , in case I have n't been harsh enough on this lineup , I 'm going to play the race card too : why are just two of the 28 performers blacks under the age of however old they O'Jays are ( Chrisette Michelle and Musiq Soulchild ) ?
Is it because there are n't many young black musicians out there ?
And why are there no black performers on the main stage ?
Is it not accessible through the back entrance ?
( For the record , I 'm not accusing CDE of racism , just of being out of touch with the music scene . )
It 's the Christmas season though , so I 'll wrap up this article with the positives : HullabaLOU is n't for seven more months and four main - stage acts are still TBA .
And as the festival 's website promises more than 65 acts , only 28 of whom have been announced , CDE has plenty of opportunities to find some relevant performers ( and maybe even some black ones too ) .
Otherwise HullabaLOU might be Churchill Down 's version of North Haverbrook 's monorail .

If any of your loved ones are serving abroad , you might be interested to know the Obama administration , by virtue of SCOTUS 's refusal of the case , just got the Supreme Court 's blessing to torture .
Obviously , other countries will follow our lead :
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ’s refusal Monday to review a lower court ’s dismissal of a case brought by four British former Guantanamo prisoners against former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld , the detainees ’ lawyers charged Tuesday that the country ’s highest court evidently believes that " torture and religious humiliation are permissible tools for a government to use . "
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington , D.C. , had ruled that government officials were immune from suit because at that time it was unclear whether abusing prisoners at Guantanamo was illegal .
Channeling their predecessors in the George W. Bush administration , Obama Justice Department lawyers argued in this case that there is no constitutional right not to be tortured or otherwise abused in a U.S. prison abroad .
The Obama administration had asked the court not to hear the case .
By agreeing , the court let stand an earlier opinion by the D.C. Circuit Court , which found that the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act – a statute that applies by its terms to all " persons " – did not apply to detainees at Guantanamo , effectively ruling that the detainees are not persons at all for purposes of U.S. law .
The lower court also dismissed the detainees ’ claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Geneva Conventions , finding defendants immune on the basis that " torture is a foreseeable consequence of the military ’s detention of suspected enemy combatants . "
Finally , the circuit court found that , even if torture and religious abuse were illegal , defendants were immune under the Constitution because they could not have reasonably known that detainees at Guantanamo had any constitutional rights .
The circuit court ruled that " torture is a foreseeable consequence of the military ’s detention of suspected enemy combatants . "
That opinion was written by Judge Karen Lecraft Henderson , who was appointed to the federal circuit court by Ronald Reagan in 1986 and to the Appeals Court in 1990 by George H.W. Bush .
The British detainees spent more than two years in Guantanamo and were repatriated to Britain in 2004 with no charges ever having been filed against them .
Eric Lewis , lead attorney for the detainees , said , " It is an awful day for the rule of law and common decency when the Supreme Court lets stand such an inhuman decision .
The final word on whether these men had a right not to be tortured or a right to practice their religion free from abuse is that they did not . "
" The lower court found that torture is all in a days ’ work for the secretary of defense and senior generals , " he added .
" That violates the president ’s stated policy , our treaty obligations , and universal legal norms .
Yet the Obama administration , in its rush to protect executive power , lost its moral compass and persuaded the Supreme Court to avoid a central moral challenge .
Today our standing in the world has suffered a further great loss . "
Center for Constitutional Rights Senior Attorney Shayana Kadidal , co-counsel on the case , told IPS , " In many ways the opinion the Supreme Court left standing today is worse when one gets past the bottom line – no accountability for torture and religious abuse – and digs into the legal reasoning . "
" One set of claims are dismissed because torture is said to be a foreseeable consequence of military detention , " he said .
" How will the parents of our troops captured in future foreign wars react to that ? "

• Yeah , it 's $ 530 unsubsidized .
Google 's not going to be selling the phone at cost , like so many people considered .
They 're not going to save us from the " making money off of hardware " culture we 've got right now , so this is basically just another Android handset , albeit a really good one
• If you want it subsidized , you 'll have to sign up for a 2 year mandatory contract and pay $ 180 for the phone
• There 's only one rate plan : $ 39.99 Even More +

Web for $ 79.99 total
• Existing customers cannot keep their plan if they want a subsidized phone ; they have to change to the one plan , and this only applies to accounts with one single line
• If that does n't fly with you , you have to buy the $ 530 unlocked version — this actually might save you money over two years if you already have a cheap plan
• Family plans , Flexpay , SmartAccess and KidConnect subscribers must buy the phone unlocked and unsubsidized for $ 530
• You can only buy five Nexus One phones per Google account
• There is language in the agreement of shipping outside the US
• Google will sell it at google .com / phone , which explains what they were doing with that page a few weeks ago
• Google will still call it the Nexus One apparently , and not the Google Phone

And here is a big one :
• If you cancel your plan before 120 days , you have to pay the subsidy difference between what you paid and the unsubsidized price , so $ 350 in this case .
Or you can return the phone to Google .
You also authorize them to charge this directly to your credit card .
One weirdness in the Terms of Sale that we quickly glanced through was that Google made sure you acknowledged that the manufacturer is HTC , and not Google .

Studying a rare disorder known as tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) , researchers at Children 's Hospital Boston add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that autism spectrum disorders , which affect 25 to 50 percent of TSC patients , result from a miswiring of connections in the developing brain , leading to improper information flow .
The finding may also help explain why many people with TSC have seizures and intellectual disabilities .
Findings were published online in Nature Neuroscience on January 10 .
TSC causes benign tumors throughout the body , including the brain .
But patients with TSC may have autism , epilepsy or intellectual disabilities even in the absence of these growths .
Now , researchers led by Mustafa Sahin , MD , PhD , of Children 's Department of Neurology , provide evidence that mutations in one of the TSC 's causative genes , known as TSC2 , prevent growing nerve fibers ( axons ) from finding their proper destinations in the developing brain .
Studying a well - characterized axon route -- between the eye 's retina and the visual area of the brain -- Sahin and colleagues showed that when mouse neurons were deficient in TSC2 , their axons failed to land in the right places .
Further investigation showed that the axons ' tips , known as " growth cones , " did not respond to navigation cues from a group of molecules called ephrins .
" Normally ephrins cause growth cones to collapse in neurons , but in tuberous sclerosis the axons do n't heed these repulsive cues , so keep growing , " says Sahin , the study 's senior investigator .
Additional experiments indicated that the loss of responsiveness to ephrin signals resulted from activation of a molecular pathway called mTOR , whose activity increased when neurons were deficient in TSC2 .
Axon tracing in the mice showed that many axons originating in the retina were not mapping to the expected part of the brain .
Although the study looked only at retinal connections to the brain , the researchers believe their findings may have general relevance for the organization of the developing brain .
Scientists speculate that in autism , wiring may be abnormal in the areas of the brain involved in social cognition .

" People have started to look at autism as a developmental disconnection syndrome -- there are either too many connections or too few connections between different parts of the brain , " says Sahin .
" In the mouse models , we 're seeing an exuberance of connections , consistent with the idea that autism may involve a sensory overload , and / or a lack of filtering of information . "
Sahin hopes that the brain 's miswiring can be corrected by drugs targeting the molecular pathways that cause it .
The mTOR pathway is emerging as central to various kinds of axon abnormalities , and drugs inhibiting mTOR has already been approved by the FDA .
For example , one mTOR inhibitor , rapamycin , is currently used mainly to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients , and Sahin plans to launch a clinical trial of a rapamycin - like drug in approximately 50 patients with TSC later this year , to see if the drug improves neurocognition , autism and seizures .
In 2008 , Sahin and colleagues published related research in Genes & Development showing that when TSC1 and TSC2 are inactivated , brain cells grow more than one axon -- an abnormal configuration that exacerbates abnormal brain connectivity .
The mTOR pathway was , again , shown to be involved , and when it was inhibited with rapamycin , neurons grew normally , sprouting just one axon .
Supporting the mouse data , a study by Sahin and his colleague Simon Warfield , PhD , in the Computational Radiology Laboratory at Children 's , examined the brains of 10 patients with TSC , 7 of whom also had autism or developmental delay , and 6 unaffected controls .
Using an advanced kind of MRI imaging called diffusion tensor imaging , they documented disorganized and structurally abnormal tracts of axons in the TSC group , particularly in the visual and social cognition areas of the brain ( see image ) .
The axons also were poorly myelinated -- their fatty coating , which helps axons conduct electrical signals , was compromised .
( In other studies , done in collaboration with David Kwiatkowski at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , giving rapamycin normalized myelination in mice . )
Sahin has also been studying additional genes previously found to be deleted or duplicated in patients with autism , and finding that deletion of some of them causes neurons to produce multiple axons -- an abnormality that , again , appears to be reversed with rapamycin .
" Many of the genes implicated in autism may possibly converge on a few common pathways controlling the wiring of nerve cells , " says Sahin .
" Rare genetic disorders like TSC are providing us with vital clues about brain mechanisms leading to autism spectrum disorders .
Understanding the neurobiology of these disorders is likely to lead to new treatment options not only for TSC patients , but also for patients with other neurodevelopmental diseases caused by defective myelination and connectivity , such as autism , epilepsy and intellectual disability . "

Weapons manufacturer FN Herstal has created a " Black Box " that detects , discriminates , counts shots , measures burst rates and burst lengths , records firing sequences and detects stoppages due to failures to cycle .
Designed to fit any weapon type , the molded FN Black Box improves maintenance processes and can deliver critical information to mission commanders including , when coupled to a GPS , ID and location data .
The unit has a non-replaceable battery and the company says it has a service life of 10 years and a recording capacity of 100,000 rounds .
FN Herstal 's Black Box is part of its Armatronics system , which can communicate useful information to the chain of command during a mission because the unit holds the identification number of the weapon and can therefore indirectly identify the soldier .
The upper command level could , for instance , follow up the ammunition usage / supply of a squad during a mission .
Chinese environment officials are rushing to build three temporary barriers on the Yellow river after failing to contain an oil slick in a tributary of the country 's second largest waterway .
Despite overnight efforts by 700 workers to dig diversion channels , the contamination belt — which was 13 miles long at its peak — has tainted the giant Sanmenxia reservoir , the state media reported today .
Some areas have been forced to suspend water supplies according to the Xinhua news agency , as the spill spread from the Wei tributary in Shaanxi province to the Yellow river in Henan province .
Separate reports said the major downstream cities of Zhangzhou and Kaifeng would not be affected as they have alternative water supplies .
The oil spill occurred last Wednesday when 150 tonnes of diesel leaked from the Lanzhou - to - Chengsha pipeline owned by the China National Petroleum Corporation , but it did not become known publicly until Sunday .
After the leak , the state - owned firm and environment ministry dispatched teams to the area to try to control the leak before it entered the Yellow river , which sustains 140 million people with water supplies for drinking , irrigation and industry .
As well as diversion ditches , they used 27 floating barriers to try to isolate the diesel so that it could be removed or soaked up with absorbent materials .
China 's vice premier Li Keqiang said the operation should " strictly prevent leakage and pollution from flowing into the Yellow river and ensure the safety of drinking water for the masses , " according to a news release at the weekend .
But today 's monitoring data along the Yellow river indicate the efforts were only partially successful , with the already poor water quality deteriorating further .
The Sanmenxia dam has been closed to prevent the contamination from passing further downstream .
Emergency teams are using the floating barriers to divert the spill to an area of the reservoir where it can be dealt with .
The environment department of Henan province said its senior officials has been dispatched to join the containment effort .
" We do n't have anyone here who can comment as they all at the site , " said an operator at the head office .
The Yellow , often described as the Cradle of Chinese civilisation , is one of the country 's most heavily exploited and polluted rivers .
According to the United Nations , water is unfit for any use along one third of the river .

The Fed Chair thinks the problem was n't the Fed 's low interest rates .
He says the Fed just did not have enough power .
The grimmest news of the new year has to be the fact that Fed chairman Ben Bernanke still has no clue about the causes of our financial crisis or what measures need to be undertaken to avoid another crisis .
Bernanke gave a speech yesterday at the Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association that did two things .
First , he exonerated Alan Greenapan 's low - interest rates from blame for the housing bubble , arguing that the housing bubble began before the Fed pushed interest rates low and that the size of the bubble cannot really be explained by monetary policy alone .
Perhaps more importantly , however , Bernanke makes the extraordinary claim that regulatory and supervisory policies would have been effective means of addressing the run up in housing prices .
What makes this claim so extraordinary is that it completely ignores the fact that regulatory and supervisory policies were n't just ineffective at popping the housing bubble — they were actively fueling it .
" Clearly , for lenders and borrowers focused on minimizing the initial payment , the choice of mortgage type was far more important than the level of short - term interest rates , " Bernanke said .
Bernanke argues that exotic mortgages and rubbish underwriting standards that he thinks are " the key explanation " for the housing bubble .
But he ignores the fact that these " alternative mortgage products " were created in response to regulatory pressure to expand home ownership .
It was n't just lenders and borrowers who were focused on minimizing the initial payment — that was the policy of the government of the United States .
Banking regulation and supervision in the late nineties and early years of this decade were largely driven by a particular ideology adopted by both presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush — the ideology that flourished under the rubric " The Ownership Society . "
The regulators who worked for their administrations pushed , cajoled and required banks and mortgage lenders to create and spread the types of mortgages that later turned out to be so toxic .
In particular , the government went to war against two of the biggest barriers to home ownership : accumulating funds for a down payment and the complex documentation that accompanied getting a mortgage .
The Bush administration addressed this with both legislation and arm - twisting .
It signed into law the American Dream Downpayment Fund , aimed at helping low - income families own homes by subsidizing their downpayments .
It issued challenges to lenders to " close the homeownership gap " by loosening lending standards .
It celebrated lenders who did this .
In June 2002 , Bush announced the downpayment subsidy on a tour of Atlanta 's Pryor Road area , where new housing developments were replacing rundown housing projects .
He described its goal in religious terms :
It means we use the mighty muscle of the federal government in combination with state and local governments to encourage owning your own home .
That 's what that means .
And it means -- it means that each of us , each of us , have a responsibility in the great country to put something greater than ourselves -- to promote something greater than ourselves .
And to me , that something greater than yourself is to love a neighbor like you 'd like to be loved yourself .
The next day , speaking at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , Bush got much more specific about his goals — providing housing subsidies , reducing paperwork and eliminating down payments .
Here 's the key part of the speech directly from HUD 's website ( emphasis added ) :
Well , probably the single barrier to first - time homeownership is high down payments .
People take a look at the down payment , they say that 's too high , I 'm not buying .
They may have the desire to buy , but they do n't have the wherewithal to handle the down payment .
We can deal with that .
And so I 've asked Congress to fully fund an American Dream down payment fund which will help a low - income family to qualify to buy , to buy .
( Applause . )
We believe when this fund is fully funded and properly administered , which it will be under the Bush administration , that over 40,000 families a year -- 40,000 families a year -- will be able to realize the dream we want them to be able to realize , and that 's owning their own home .
( Applause . )
The second barrier to ownership is the lack of affordable housing .
There are neighborhoods in America where you just can't find a house that 's affordable to purchase , and we need to deal with that problem .
The best way to do so , I think , is to set up a single family affordable housing tax credit to the tune of $ 2.4 billion over the next five years to encourage affordable single family housing in inner-city America .
( Applause . )
The third problem is the fact that the rules are too complex .
People get discouraged by the fine print on the contracts .
They take a look and say , well , I 'm not so sure I want to sign this .
There 's too many words .
( Laughter . )
There 's too many pitfalls .
So one of the things that the Secretary is going to do is he 's going to simplify the closing documents and all the documents that have to deal with homeownership .
In September , Bush again addressed the topic at the " White House Conference on Increasing Minority Homeownership . "
( Steve Sailer fortunately preserved the speech before it vanished from the website of the White House . )
Here 's what Bush said :
To open up the doors of homeownership there are some barriers , and I want to talk about four that need to be overcome .
First , down payments .
A lot of folks can't make a down payment .
They may be qualified .
They may desire to buy a home , but they do n't have the money to make a down payment .
I think if you were to talk to a lot of families that are desirous to have a home , they would tell you that the down payment is the hurdle that they can't cross .
And one way to address that is to have the federal government participate .
You can pretty much randomly pick any speech that Bush gave on housing during the early years of his administration and find this sort of thing .
But the point is n't just to finger Bush as a culprit — it 's to point out that it was n't a lack of regulatory response that allowed the housing bubble to inflate .
The regulatory action was a key inflator of the bubble .
This is why Bernanke 's view is so disturbing .
He urges " stronger regulation " but shows no awareness of the culpability of regulations for the bubble .
Or , more charitably , he only acknowledges that the regulatory response was inadequate rather than wrong headed .
" The lesson I take from this experience is not that financial regulation and supervision are ineffective for controlling emerging risks , but that their execution must be better and smarter , " Bernanke writes .
But it was n't execution that got bungled .
It was the entire regulatory plan to increasing home ownership and closing the ownership gap that was wrong from the start .
Of course , bankers and mortgage lenders and home buyers contributed to the housing bubble through errant faith in rising home prices , greed and occasional fraud .
But the mistakes and crimes of individuals and financial institutions would not have lead to a crisis without the homogenizing effect of regulation .
The errors of ideology and quest for power among regulators were imposed on everyone .
The regulators were the key source of systemic risk that created the housing bubble , fed the mortgage boom and made the crash so widespread and catastrophic .
This blindness to regulatory fault suggests that regulatory and supervisory policies adopted in response to the crisis will , at best , be ineffective means to avoid a future crisis .
But it should n't be that surprising .
Almost no one — whether they run companies or government agencies — can be counted on to correctly identify their own mistakes and learn the right lessons from any failure .
The market deals with this by not requiring anyone to learn anything — it simply creates losses at firms that make mistakes .
The market knew the Time Warner merger with AOL was a disaster long before Gerald Levin .
But regulators have no recourse to market corrections , so their own mistakes have no corrective .
The worst part about all of this is that the inability to recognize a crisis caused by regulatory failure — as opposed to one caused regulatory laxity — means that men like Bernanke will push for stronger regulations and supervision — and therefore more market homogenization and less competitive experimentation .
And a few years from now , we 'll be writing this same damn thing all over again .
' Tis the season to be jolly , and so I for one am not about to allow the rotten old " prowlers - that - be " to spoil it for me .
Instead , in this Christmas season or — with a few notable qualifications — at any time , we should laugh heartily at the behaviour of those who think they own us and can impose their evil schemes on our lives .
There is a time for everything of course , and it's worth bearing in mind that striking a bum note with a misplaced snort of disapproval can land even the best of fellows in hot water .

Along that line — though I wo n't say where and I wo n't say when — I do remember only too well , many years ago , throwing caution to the wind and laughing both loudly and scornfully at a rather unsavoury policeman requiring a substantial contribution to his personal welfare fund .
Now , you may well join me in considering his offer of freedom of movement in return to be wholly inadequate , but I do recall my response being — if richly deserved — still perhaps , ill - timed .
Perhaps also it would be as well here , to advise the thoughtful reader that in the presence of armed public officials , the use of any phrase including the noun " parasite " should be weighed carefully on the scales of risk versus reward .

Now certainly , in the ensuing events , it was not my thumb that was busted , my jaw that was socked , nor I that was stretched out on the pavement .
Nevertheless , I would not hesitate to acknowledge a profound lack of wisdom , and a deep gratitude for a merciful Heaven that got me out of a sticky situation of some magnitude — and largely unscathed .

Heaven does deem it appropriate on occasion to reveal its otherwise mysterious ways , which in this case — I later became aware — involved a relative of the local dictator , putting a " word in season " in the ear of the Inspector General of Police .
Thankfully , words reaching such elevated ears generally filter down through the ranks .

Nonetheless — and notwithstanding some proviso that incorporates a moderate dash of prudence — here 's the nub of the issue : Laughing at them at one time or another is truly our happy and holy lot according to the Holy Scriptures — Psalms , Chapter 2 actually :
The kings of the earth set themselves ,
And the rulers take counsel together , Against the LORD and against His Anointed , [ saying ] , “ Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us . ”

Still — nothing quite takes the wind from the sails of a pompous ass more than the growing realization that his opponents no longer weigh his proposals with grave foreboding .
And , if ever there was a time to put the distasteful characters and activities of the Busybody Class right on the butt end of a joke , it 's now — in the season of merriment .
So , I 'm just going to list a bunch of movies , TV series , books and even games that might help you do so , and that have done the very same for my own household .
I 'll also list a few that may well curl your lip into a sneer of derision as you eye the exposed monolith disparagingly from top to toe .
And I 'll add one or two that soundly castigate the State while we cheer our heroic freedom lovers as they come out on top :
Race To Witch Mountain Best Price : $ 1.39 Buy New $ 3.95 ( as of 06:45 EST - Details )
Laugh at the State — not with it
There is one outstanding TV series that has such an atmosphere , and that makes my family laugh so much , we must have watched each episode a half dozen times .
The overall look and production values are the very highest — almost to Technicolor standards .
It is the wonderful A&E channel serialization of Rex Stout 's " Nero Wolfe " mysteries .
This show gives the police a thorough drubbing whenever they behave like bullies — although it treats them civilly enough when they actually apprehend a wrongdoer ( usually handed to them on a plate ) .
Even the FBI and eventually J. Edgar Hoover himself are given a sound thrashing in my personal favourite , the movie - length episode called " The Doorbell Rang . "
Perry Mason : Season 1 , ... Best Price : $ 4.48 Buy New $ 9.00 ( as of 05:50 EST - Details )
Here is a typical first - class clip from an episode where the police are denied sandwiches for blocking off Wolfe 's study .
Rex Stout was a good friend of P.G. Wodehouse — which leads me on to Jeeves and Wooster , that marvellous best of British TV series — with perhaps some slight influence on the tone of this article .
Wodehouse generally reflects older and better values , with the police actually regarded as servants , not lords and masters , of the public — even perhaps overly servile to their betters .
But few sights stimulate good old Christmas cheer like watching a " Bobby " being clipped round the ear , such as in this spiffing clip from " Jeeves Saves The Cow Creamer . "
The Bourne Trilogy ( Th ... Best Price : $ 1.62 Buy New $ 7.00 ( as of 10:50 EST - Details )
Wodehouse was unfairly accused of Nazi sympathies , but in both the books and the series , the Hitlerian Spode and his ridiculous authoritarian grand plans are frequently trimmed down to size .
Fair is fair , so the commies get put in their place too , especially in " Comrade Bingo . "
Even pompous elite feudalism gets biffed on the sniffer when the nephew of a noble Lord wants to marry a waitress and Jeeves is assigned the task of softening him up .
Reading a Jeeves and Wooster story always makes a chap laugh out loud , but P.G. Wodehouse also had other highly amusing characters .
I particularly recommend the " Mr. Mulliner " books of short stories — and do n't miss " Mulliners Buck - U - Uppo . "
Also recommended is Galahad at Blandings Castle .
Galahad for example , notes after a much needed restorative snifter that , " it did n't float like a butterfly or sting like bee , but did carry with it a certain air of quiet authority . "
On another occasion , a disapproving relative gives him " the kind of look that could open an oyster at 40 paces . "

Next , the bungling , incompetent Maxwell Smart of the original Get Smart TV series could be a good antidote to any misplaced awe of the secretive snooping bureaucracies .
The recent Get Smart movie is very funny too , though with one or two not quite family - friendly moments .
Recently released on DVD , The Race To Witch Mountain is a ridiculous sci-fi action film — but is also full of laughs and makes the government look bad , so it gets a worthy mention .
It is an absolutely top notch Disney family film — even adults can enjoy it .
The Manchurian Candida ... Check Amazon for Pricing .
Lastly , if you can find a copy of Laurel and Hardy 's classic " Pack Up Your Troubles " it is one of their best .
Dodging the draft is all part of the fun , even when Stan bungles it .
Then the true cost of war means the pals dutifully try to find an orphaned little girl 's nearest relatives .
After Ollie stands up to a sour social worker by asking how much he would charge to haunt a house , the boys are then hotly pursued by snooty officials trying to seize and institutionalize the child … .
Holding the State in derision
A lot of healthy , family - friendly derision — at the expense of officialdom — is inevitable while watching the first and possibly best of the old Perry Mason television shows .
These are quality productions , properly filmed and with scripts supervised by Earl Stanley Gardner himself to ensure clever mysteries , and always with a twist in the tale .

The Perry Mason show was very popular at the time and clearly contributed toward some later reining in of prosecutorial and police abuse .
We watch very little current television .
Instead , for the last year or so we have often enjoyed a " Perry " in the evening .

Down with the State
On the off - chance that any reader has missed a freedom classic , I will briefly mention a few movies that are thoroughly enjoyable , even without full - blown hilarity .
The Bourne Trilogy almost goes without saying .
The only cinema trip I have made since childhood was to see The Bourne Ultimatum .
The outstanding fight with " Desh " in Morocco had me bracing for every blow and intensely gripping my seat all the way through .
Apocalypto .

The Manchurian Candidate is a brilliant , complex conspiracy thriller — with close parallels to real life .
Shooter is almost in the same league as the Bournes , with an unfolding anti-war , anti-state conspiracy storyline .
The film was hated by the neocons — so the kneejerk principle alone dictates you must watch it .
In places there is some ugly personal abuse and one or two F - words to go with it , but it is sound overall .
Finally , everyone knows about the fabulous Gladiator , but perhaps not that there is an extended version with an extra 17 minutes film time plus numerous documentaries available .
Equilibrium Best Price : $ 1.00 Buy New $ 4.22 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
I 'll also include the foul - mouthed Enemy of the State as an otherwise very good film .
Despite the overwhelming language and some screaming matches I nevertheless liked it so much that years ago I edited a special version for the whole family to watch .
Equilibrium , Minority Report and Open Range are all fine films that either target or exclude Public Enemy No. 1 .
Lastly , put on the list The Count of Monte Cristo ( 2002 ) with Jim Caviezel .
The system absorbs and then assists the main bad guy in this excellent family action film .
The Ultimate State Buster ?
The Lord of the Rings trilogy targets so well and in such detail , so many aspects of the lust for power — and strikes right at the heart of the State 's existence .
So perhaps consider watching once again the Lord of the Rings films .
They will make you laugh at , sneer at or even curse the evil concept of exercising Power over others — or of being deceived into grovelling servitude .
Minority Report ( Wides ... MINORITY REPORT Best Price : $ 0.99 Buy New $ 4.85 ( as of 08:55 EST - Details )

Some computer games do generally ignore or sideline officialdom and some have been enjoyed for years by my children :
Runescape is a free online game with optional paid upgrades .
Amazingly , a middle - aged customer of mine , an engineer by trade , called me out just to fix his computer for Runescape — having picked up the habit from his young son .
It 's not up my street at all , but my boys particularly like this game — and it has at least some merit , teaching buying and selling , profit and loss .
Voyage Century is an excellent free online game .
It is all about free trade and very educational .
Sail your own ship around the globe in the 16th century to trade , buy , sell , fight pirates etc. choose to accept or ( hint ) reject government contracts — and all to a nice , uplifting classical sound score .
Highly recommended .
All girls like " Neopets " and boys too .
They can create their own pet and score points in a pet world of games and activities .
All for free .
Good fun for younger children ( up to the teen years ) .

All boys like swords , knives , guns and shooting — it is just natural .
The trouble is many " shoot 'em up " games are rooted in militaristic propaganda .
But there are good shooters that are n't :
Far Cry ( Jewel Case ) - PC Best Price : $ 11.65 Buy New $ 15.00 ( as of 07:05 EST - Details )
Far Cry is an older game now but still has very good graphics .
The story and game - play are excellent and it is not a military campaign environment .
Jack Carver gets washed ashore on an island full of murderous Blackwater type mercenaries .
Some mild coarseness and attitude is evident — the strongest being " your a** is grass ! " ( my retort : " your nose is blown ! " ) .
But it is gripping fun — for adults too .
Online it is a real laugh - out - loud game , with just a red team and a blue team .
Lord of the Rings , " The Battle for Middle Earth " and Lord of the Rings Conquest are also good action games that my boys have spent quite some time on .
There are a number of other good LOTR games , including a paid online version .
Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is getting on now , but for young ones who have never played it , it can offer hours of educational fun .

That is the goodwill that was shown toward us .

The choice to accept that gift and stay with it — by refusing any fear or despair and choosing to " rejoice in the Lord always " — is my final and best personal recommendation to you in the holiday season and beyond :
" … be of good cheer , I have overcome the world "
The real test of good cheer and of hope is the ability to laugh when a problem or enemy comes to our attention .
Let 's laugh at our enemy the State like it was Wile E. Coyote .
( Maybe stick " Roadrunner " on the viewing list . )
So the next time the blighters - that - be make you feel like loosing off a few blankety - blanks — do n't let them get to you .
Have faith and laugh in derision instead — you 'll feel better almost immediately .
As long as there are those who will do that , there 's hope that at the end of this hair - raising episode , and the evil bounders will be forced to say through gritted teeth , " Blast ! Foiled again ! "
Have a happy Christmas .

The erroneous trade briefly caused market turmoil in December 2005
A Japanese court has ordered the Tokyo Stock Exchange ( TSE ) to pay 10.7bn yen ( $ 121 m ; £ 73 m ) in damages for failing to stop a huge trading error in 2005 .
The TSE must pay Mizuho Securities the compensation after admitting that a system fault prevented a trader from cancelling an erroneous share sale .
The trader had entered an order to sell 610,000 shares for one yen each instead of one share at 610,000 yen .
The error cost the firm 40.7 bn yen .
The TSE said it would consider appealing .
Mizuho Securities had asked for compensation of 41.5 bn yen .
TSE president Atsushi Saito said : " We are considering many options , including an appeal . "
Computer problem
The typing error had briefly caused turmoil on the Tokyo bourse .
The then president of the exchange , Takuo Tsurushima , resigned soon after the incident in December 2005 .
He admitted that his computers had not allowed Mizuho to cancel the sale of shares in the telecoms firm J - Com in time .
As well as the compensation order from the Tokyo District Court , the exchange also received a " business improvement order " from the Financial Services Agency .
Reading Tad Friend 's New Yorker piece about protesting Berkeley students on the plane yesterday , I got to wondering :
Why do college kids staging demonstrations piss me off so much these days ?
Am I stodgy and old , or is Revolution dead ?
Not that the kids in that mid-California enclave are n't fighting for something good .
The entirety of their state has turned out its pockets and little foreclosed - upon moths have flown out and that is a bad thing , especially for a big budget - sucking public university system like U.C. , which may soon be finally vanquished by the raging ghost of Ronald Reagan .
( Communists and homosexuals beware ! )
Staff cuts and faculty hiring freezes and tuition increases are all things worth getting upset about , especially at such a prestigious but wildly mismanaged university , but I just can't help finding the tactics and the attitude so irksome , so stubbornly pop-political and self - concerened .
Friend writes about a group of building occupiers on Berkeley 's campus who felt a little disappointed , a little cheated even , that they were n't arrested .
They wanted the outrage and the belligerence and the fighting .
So they could get a louder point across ?
Yes , probably .
But also , maybe , so they could have war stories and battle scars , so they could feel the selfish swell of having done something monumental and risky and public .
" Were n't you one of those kids , " awed anti-Zionist freshmen will whisper to these now wizened and graying seniors .
" Yeah , you know " they 'll say , propping a ratty black utility soldier boot up on the dumpster dived coffee table .
" It just needed to be done . "
It 's cruel and not a little presumptuous of me to assume that these intellectual elites — these silly children thundering about things they can't , by virtue of their age , really understand — are in it for personal gain , but I still do .
I still felt that nagging itch while reading the New Yorker article , and I felt it ( probably more strongly ) while looking at those NYU twerps who took over a school building a while back for vague reasons , issuing dopey demands , chief among them " We demand to not get in trouble for this . "
I just do n't sense anything genuine and worthy about these modern day movementarians , they seem so ridiculous and petulant and annoying .
That can't be a fair assessment , can it ?
I read Natasha Vargas - Cooper 's " End of the 00s " post on The Awl — about how the baby boomers have ruined everything — and felt compelled to comment about how all the nostalgia for the change - making of the '60s ( which college kids played a large part in ) has ruined ideas of American protesting forever , because they supposedly perfected it back then , and thereby ossified it for everyone else .
And maybe my feelings of " Oh , brother " about these futurekids ( class of 2014 ? wtf? ) are a product of that .
Why even bother trying , right ?
Cynicism and blogs and stuff have totally made earnest intellectual rebellion a joke .
I mean , who do these kids think they are , Abbie Hoffman ??
Or maybe my problem is with the cause .
Budget issues and staff firings ( for money , not for race or creed or sex malfunction ) are sort of dry .
And yet these kids are locking themselves in buildings and throwing things at riot police and acting as if The Whole World Is Watching .
That 's just dumb .
At least it seems , knee - jerkingly , dumb to me .
The stakes are just so low compared to the noise .
Why are college student protesters so annoying these days ?
( Were they always annoying , no matter what generation ? )
Seriously , I 'm asking .
I know I should feel good about youthful idealism and bright naive hopes that total overhaul is possible , but I do n't .
Someone please articulate why this is — or better yet explain to me why it is n't — so I can stop feeling like such a right - drifting old 26 - year - old .
( Natural News ) Several years ago , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( PSTF ) issued an updated set of recommendations about mammogram screenings , suggesting which and how often women should get them .
Since the last time the group issued its recommendations in 2002 , new study data emerged that has led to a few changes .
Its new guidelines , suggesting that women over 40 only need a mammogram every two years , has led to a firestorm of criticism from professional and advocacy groups as well as politicians .
The American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society were quick to condemn the new findings , ones that PSTF has explained made the best sense based on current published data .
The group consulted the Evidence - Based Practice Center at the Oregon Health and Science University for all current , relevant information about breast cancer screenings and arrived at what it says is a well - informed conclusion concerning routine screenings for older women .
Dr. Heidi Nelson , the lead researcher at the university who compiled the information for the PSTF panel , and her team scoured all available data on the subject and constructed it for review .
Fifteen outside scientists were tasked with reviewing the information prior to being presented to panel members .
One of the primary studies was a recent British study that compared 54,000 women who received routine mammograms beginning at age 40 with 107,000 women of the same age who did not receive them .
The results of this comprehensive study revealed that there was virtually no difference in breast cancer death rates between the two groups .
A comprehensive analysis of all available studies , including a few that showed some benefit from routine mammograms and others that did not , led to the conclusion that there is only a minimal benefit to receiving routine mammograms .
What researchers have found is that for every 1,900 women between the ages of 40 and 50 that are screened yearly for breast cancer using mammography , one death is prevented in the following two decades .
Five women would have died regardless of screenings , so out of six potential deaths , one would have been prevented .
On the other hand , the potential harm induced by mammography screenings includes excessive testing and over - diagnosis , including many false positives .
Analysis revealed that women have a 10 percent change of being falsely diagnosed .
A significant number of cancers detected are not even malignant , yet mammograms are unable to differentiate between harmful and benign cancers .
Over-diagnosis , which is a growing concern among medical professionals , was not properly assessed or understood in 2002 when the last recommendations from PSTF were published .
Many women are needlessly undergoing invasive and harmful surgery , radiation treatment , and chemotherapy for cancers that are not even harmful .
Dr. Russell Harris from the University of North Carolina , one of the panel members , explained that mammography is only effective at diagnosing one type of cancer , the malignant , slow - growing kind that can be effectively treated when diagnosed early .
This kind represents only 15 percent of deadly cancers .
Precise numbers of over - diagnosis were not easy to pinpoint since estimates ranged from six percent to upwards of 50 percent .
Dr. Timothy
Wilt from the University of Minnesota , however , estimated that about 30 percent of cancers detected by mammography are over - diagnosed , meaning that they were either benign or untreatable .
Statisticians from the Anderson Cancer Center in Maryland were tasked with assessing screening intervals .
Based on an analysis of a large cross-section of women , the group determined that there is virtually no benefit from mammography screenings for women in their 40s .
Thus they determined that these women could reduce their risk of harm from mammography by getting screened every other year rather than annually .
What do these findings ultimately reveal ?
First , mammography screenings come with a myriad of potentially negative side effects while offering scant benefits .
Over - diagnosis being the primary concern among researchers , countless women have undergone and continue to undergo dangerous procedures needlessly .
More often than not , benign tumors are improperly diagnosed at the expense of the woman 's health .
The radiation involved in the screening process also contributes to increasing a woman 's risk of developing breast cancer .
By subjecting the body continually to low - dose radiation , otherwise harmless cancer cells are encouraged to multiply and spread .
The fact that even mainstream research is now proving that mammograms provide virtually no benefit should be a wake up call to physicians everywhere who embrace the practice .
Safer screening methods like thermography confer the same benefits while eliminating radiation exposure .
Since screenings of any kind can still lead to a false diagnosis , a woman 's best bet is to prevent breast cancer nutritionally .
Anti-cancer foods and nutrients will prevent malignant cancer cells from ever developing in the first place .
When combined with exercise and a healthy lifestyle , there is no reason why any woman should ever develop a deadly form of breast cancer .

Like the old joke , I have good news and I have bad news .
The good news is that LRC is more influential than ever .
This was already the best - read libertarian site on the web , and the one Ron Paul reads first thing every morning .
And 2009 traffic is up 28 % over 2008 , which was already the best - read in our 11 - year history .
More and more Americans , especially young people , turn here for the kind of news and opinion — and good writing — they ca n’t find in the standard media , print or electronic .
And not only America : LRC is attracting readers from all over the world .
And I ca n’t tell you how many people write to tell me they used to be neocons or left - liberals , but now , thanks to LRC , they are libertarians .
With fascism - socialism on the march in the US and so many other countries , how important is the untrammeled voice of freedom , unafraid , uncompromising , innovative , and effective .
No part of the regime , no statist intellectual , bankster , CIA killer , Wall Streeter , nor shill , will find deference on LewRockwell.com .
Here , we recognize the state , as Murray Rothbard put it , as u201 Ca gang of thieves writ large .
u201D
That goes for the presidency , the Congress , the Supreme Court , the Fed , the Pentagon , and every other sinkhole for our stolen money .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Nor will we heed the bleats of u201Cterrorism , terrorismu201D as an excuse to fasten the police state on us .
Clinton , Bush , Obama — and their equally bloody predecessors — are all given the hotfoot at LRC .
Here ’s the bad news : this site has its haters , from oil plutocrats to billionaire bankers , from neocon mouthpieces to Beltway floozies .
They want to put us out of business .
But if the bad guys were n’t bothered , we might as well shut our doors .
And that will never happen .
If we have your support .
But is all lost , given the elected - dictatorship of the presidency , the evil clowns in black robes , the killer generals , and the rest ?
Absolutely not .
Indeed , there is far more opposition than at any time since 2000 .
LRC can help fan the flames of resistance , and grow the giant Ron Paul movement too .
But we need your help to stay in existence , and to make the improvements in the site that the times demand , from a new Content Management System and redesign , to advertising on bigger sites like Drudge .
All this is very expensive .
Wo n’t you help ?
Please make a generous donation if you like this site , and want to see it grow in influence , and indeed , keep going .
We have some dreams about what we can do to make LRC even more powerful as a voice of liberty , and some surprises as well , but we need you as a partner .
Socialists , red and blue - state fascists , Keynesians , militarists , imperialists , welfare statists , inflationists , warmongers , redistributionists , big - pharma corporatists , propagandists for the regime — the targets are many and powerful .
LRC may seem only a slingshot against an army , but that ’s what they said about David .
This battle is exhilarating as well as important .
We can do much good , and have fun at the same time .
We can hammer the thieving state , its allies and apologists .
We can undermine them all .
We can do so much good for the future of our ideas .
Join me in this great fight .

This image is a combination of three photos ( using an orange , green and blue filter ) taken by the OSIRIS camera onboard ESA 's Rosetta spacecraft .
It is part of a sequence of images taken every hour through one full rotation ( 24 hours ) .
The illuminated sliver is centered around the South Pole , with South at the bottom of the image .
Acomet - chasing spacecraft swinging by Earth this week has snapped magnificent newimages of our home planet .
The newphotos come from the European Space Agency 's Rosetta spacecraft , which willmake its closest approach by Earth Friday at 2:45 a.m. EST ( 0745 GMT ) , duringits third and final flyby past the planet .
The Rosettaspacecraft 's OSIRIS narrow - angle camera captured three images of Earth with anorange , green and blue filter , and from a distance of about 393,330 miles ( 633,000 km ) .
The resulting illuminated crescent is a combination of the trio .
The combinedimage shows the Earth as blue sliver , with the South Pole roughly in thecenter .
The outline of Antarctica is visible beneath the clouds that form thesouth - polar vortex , a natural continent - wide tornado of sorts .
Pack ice infront of the coastline , due to its strong reflectivity , causes bright spots inthe image .
Besidescapturing stellar images , the flyby could help unravel a mystery that hasstumped scientists for two decades .
Space scientists have noticed craft varythe amountof orbital energy they exchange with Earth during planetary flybys .
Thisvariation shows up as a tiny difference in speed either gained or lost whencompared with that predicted by fundamental physics and that actually measuredafter the event .
Duringtomorrow's flyby , scientists will track the craft 's orbital energy , as theyhave no idea whether Rosetta will get a slight boost , brake , or experience nospeed - change at all .
Rosetta waslaunched in 2004 with a 2014goal of entering low orbit around the comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko , beforeselecting a landing spot so its small lander Philae can travel with the icyobject as it moves toward the center of the solar system .
Then , Rosetta shouldhave a front row seat as the comet gets heated by the sun and sheds its outerlayer , finally producing comets ' claim to fame ?

Real - time social graphs ( connectivity between people , places , and things ) .
That 's why scaling Facebook is hard says Jeff Rothschild , Vice President of Technology at Facebook .
Social networking sites like Facebook , Digg , and Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale .
Why is that ?
Why would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional web sites ?
Let 's find out .
Traditional websites are easier to scale than social networking sites for two reasons :
They usually access only their own data and common cached data .
Only 1 - 2 % of users are active on the site at one time .
Imagine a huge site like Yahoo .
When you come to Yahoo they can get your profile record with one get and that 's enough to build your view of the website for you .
It 's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around single records using distributed hashing schemes .
And since only a few percent of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache to handle all the active users .
Now think what happens on Facebook .
Let 's say you have 200 friends .
When you hit your Facebook account it has to go gather the status of all 200 of your friends at the same time so you can see what 's new for them .
That means 200 requests need to go out simultaneously , the replies need to be merged together , other services need to be contacted to get more details , and all this needs to be munged together and sent through PHP and a web server so you see your Facebook page in a reasonable amount of time .
Oh my .
There are several implications here , especially given that on social networking sites a high percentage of users are on the system at one time ( that 's the social part , people hang around ) :
All data is active all the time .
It 's hard to partition this sort of system because everyone is connected .
Everything must be kept in RAM cache so that the data can be accessed as fast as possible .
Partitioning means you would like to find some way to cluster commonly accessed data together so it can be accessed more efficiently .
Facebook , because of the interconnectedness of the data , did n't find any clustering scheme that worked in practice .
So instead of partitioning and denormalizing data Facebook keeps data normalized and randomly distributes data amongst thousands of databases .
This approach requires a very fast cache .
Facebook uses memcached as their caching layer .
All data is kept in cache and they 've made a lot of modifications to memcached to speed it up and to help it handle more requests ( all contributed back to the community ) .
Their caching tier services 120 million queries every second and it's the core of the site .
The problem is memcached is hard to use because it requires programmer cooperation .
It 's also easy to corrupt .
They 've developed a complicated system to keep data in the caching tier consistent with the database , even across multiple distributed data centers .
Remember , they are caching user data here , not HTML pages or page fragments .
Given how much their data changes it 's would be hard to make page caching work .
We see similar problems at Digg .
Digg , for example , must deal with the problem of sending out updates to 40,000 followers every time Kevin Rose diggs a link .
Digg and I think Twitter too have taken a different approach than Facebook .
Facebook takes a Pull on Demand approach .
To recreate a page or a display fragment they run the complete query .
To find out if one of your friends has added a new favorite band Facebook actually queries all your friends to find what 's new .
They can get away with this but because of their awesome infrastructure .
But if you 've ever wondered why Facebook has a 5,000 user limit on the number of friends , this is why .
At a certain point it 's hard to make Pull on Demand scale .
Another approach to find out what 's new is the Push on Change model .
In this model when a user makes a change it is pushed out to all the relevant users and the changes ( in some form ) are stored with each user .
So when a user want to view their updates all they need to access is their own account data .
There 's no need to poll all their friends for changes .
With security and permissions it can be surprisingly complicated to figure out who should see an update .
And if a user has 2 million followers it can be surprisingly slow as well .
There 's also an issue of duplication .
A lot of duplicate data ( or references ) is being stored , so this is a denormalized approach which can make for some consistency problems .
Should permission be consulted when data is produced or consumed , for example ?
Or what if the data is deleted after it has already been copied around ?
While all these consistency and duplications problems are interesting , Push on Change seems the more scalable approach for really large numbers of followers .
It does take a lot of work to push all the changes around , but that can be handled by a job queuing system so the work is distributed across a cluster .
The challenges will only grow as we get more and more people , more and deeper inter-connectivity , faster and faster change , and a greater desire to consume it all in real - time .
We are a long way from being able to handle this brave new world .

A harvested fish is a huge catch
The arapaima , a giant species of fish that lurks in the Amazon river , may be threatened by overfishing .
Studies reveal that errors in the classification of the species could mean that it is being pushed closer to the edge of extinction than thought .
The arapaima is the largest freshwater fish with scales in the world .
But there may actually be four species rather than one , say scientists , and a lack of research and management may allow some to be fished to extinction .
The threat to the future of these fish has been revealed in research conducted by Dr Leandro Castello of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth , Massachusetts , US , and Professor Donald Stewart of the State University of New York in Syracuse , US .
They have reviewed what is known about populations of the arapaima , and conducted detailed investigations into the status of the fish in the wild .
Previously , it was thought there was one species of arapaima ( Arapaima gigas ) , which also goes by the common names pirarucu or paiche .
They have the curse of being tasty and of having to breathe air
Dr Leandro Castello
Woods Hole Research Center , US
This perspective is based on a taxonomic review done over 160 years ago .
Adults grow to almost 3 m in length and can weigh more than 200kg , making the fish the largest with scales living in freshwater anywhere in the world .
They are also air - breathers , coming to the surface every 5 to 15 minutes to gulp air , a behaviour which allows them to colonise muddy oxygen - poor rivers and lakes within the Amazonian basin and prey on other fish that find it difficult to move in such conditions .
However , in an ongoing study , Prof Stewart has analysed nearly all preserved specimens of supposed arapaima available in museums in the world .
So far he has only found one specimen of Arapaima gigas .
The others are suspected to be closely related species , including some as yet unreported .
" Our new analyses indicate that there are at least four species of arapaima , " says Dr Castello .
" So , until further field surveys of appropriate areas are completed , we will not know if Arapaima gigas is extinct or still swimming about . "
Concern about the fish 's numbers comes from other work done by Dr Castello and Prof Stewart .
For a split second , an arapaima surfaces to gulp air That suggests that arapaima sexually mature relatively late , and need very specific habitats to both live and reproduce .
Their research also shows that populations of the fish are being put under severe pressure by fishermen .
Because of the fish 's huge size and habit of coming to the surface , it has long been a favoured fish to catch , with fisherman using harpoons and gill nets to land their prey .
" They have the curse of being tasty and of having to breathe air , " says Dr Castello .
Fishermen have been catching large numbers of arapaima in this way since the 1800s .
But now , while a few populations are increasing , others are being overfished , say the researchers , who have published a paper warning of the fish 's fate in the Journal of Applied Ichthyology .
And while Brazil implemented regulations to manage arapaima fisheries some 20 years ago , most fishermen do not follow the regulations , say the authors .
Fishermen capture a young arapaima for ecological studies " Arapaima can be viewed as badly overexploited and under some level of threat of extinction , " says Dr Castello .
One solution , they say , is to encourage community - based schemes for fisheries , and there is much need for additional action on the part of the government .
For example , their research shows that fishermen who specialise in hunting arapaima with harpoons can accurately count the fish , due to the fish 's habit of breaching the surface for air .
The fishermen can then select a sustainable proportion of the population to hunt .
" Populations of arapaima managed with this system increased about 50 % annually , while yielding increasing catches and hence economic profits to the fishermen , " says Dr Castello .
Around 100 such community schemes are in place , and some previously overexploited populations have recovered .
" Such results are extremely rare in wildlife conservation , especially in tropical countries where wildlife conservation challenges are greater than elsewhere , " says Dr Castello .
But much more needs to be done to research these fish in more detail and prevent overfishing , the scientists warn .
In particular , " the present situation may be one in which one species of arapaima is recovering in certain areas , while unrecognised species are going extinct , " they say .

In an speech to a Minnesota anti-abortion crowd last week , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin seemed to see a conspiracy in a decision to put “ In God We Trust ” on the edge — rather than the face — of new presidential dollar coins .
“ She began her remarks with a puzzling commentary on the design of newly minted dollar coins , ” Politico wrote .
“ Noting that there had been a lot of “ change ” of late , Palin recalled a recent conversation with a friend about how the phrase “ In God We Trust ” had been moved to the edge of the new coins .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Who calls a shot like that ? ” she inquired .
“ Who makes a decision like that ? ”
“ It ’s a disturbing trend , ” she added .
Turns out , the decision was made by former Republican President George W. Bush , and approved in 2005 .
Raw Story was the first to note Palin ’s “ conspiracy theory ” Monday .
The story then traveled to the Huffington Post , and then to — of all places — Fox News .
And Fox fact - checked Palin ’s claim .
In the clip below , Fox ’s Brett Baier notes that the decision to put the godly phrase on the side of the coin was made under a Republican administration , and not reversed until 2007 — with the support of Democrats in Congress .
The insightful authors of " This Time It 's Different " Carmen Reinhardt and Ken Rogoff are at it again , doing a simple yet crucial empirical analysis correlating sovereign debt ( both government and external ) , and inflation ( in some case ) with GDP growth .
It will come as no surprise to anyone that the more indebted a country is , with a government debt / GDP ratio of 0.9 , and external debt / GDP of 0.6 being critical thresholds , the more GDP growth drops materially .
Alas for the US , which is on the wrong side of this threshold , at the rate Geithner is issuing debt , the US economy will be able to grow organically , and not through stimulus after Keynesian stimulus , only after the administration manages to find a way to reduce its massive and growing debt load .
In other words never .
The core findings of the paper :
First , the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt / GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP .
Above 90 percent , median growth rates fall by one percent , and average growth falls considerably more .
We find that the threshold for public debt is similar in advanced and emerging economies .
Second , emerging markets face lower thresholds for external debt ( public and private ) — which is usually denominated in a foreign currency .
When external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP , annual growth declines by about two percent ; for higher levels , growth rates are roughly cut in half .
Third , there is no apparent contemporaneous link between inflation and public debt levels for the advanced countries as a group ( some countries , such as the United States , have experienced higher inflation when debt / GDP is high . )
The story is entirely different for emerging markets , where inflation rises sharply as debt increases .
Why does debt soar ?
Based on Reinhart and Rogoff research this is the natural response to virtually every financial crisis :
Government debt has been soaring in the wake of the recent global financial maelstrom , especially in the epi-center countries .
This might have been expected .
Using a benchmark of 14 earlier severe post - World - War II financial crises , we demonstrated ( one year ago ) that central government debt rises , on average , by about 86 percent within three years after the crisis .
We do n't need to know that precisely this is happening to the US right now : as the Fed assumes ever more private sector debt , and the administration pushes ever more problems into the future , both of these activities have to be financed , with the sad result being that every 1 - 2 weeks the US Treasury is forced to auction a staggering $ 80 billion + of new debt .
Outsized deficits and epic bank bailouts may be useful in fighting a downturn , but what is the long run macroeconomic impact or higher levels of government debt , especially against the backdrop of graying populations and rising social insurance costs ?
Graphically , the relationships of economic growth and inflation to debt load can be seen in the graph below :
As the authors point out : " From the figure , it is evident that there is no obvious link between debt and growth until public debt reaches a threshold of 90 percent .
The observations with debt to GDP over 90 percent have median growth roughly 1 percent lower than the lower debt burden groups and mean levels of growth almost 4 percent lower . "
And a little something for inflationists : " The line in Figure 2 plots the median inflation for the different debt groupings — which makes plain that there is no apparent pattern of simultaneous rising inflation and debt . "
Yet " There are exceptions to this inflation result , as Figure 3 makes plain for the Unites States , where debt levels over 90 % of GDP are linked to significantly elevated inflation . "
And as the topic of analysis of every economic inquiry undoubtedly is the US , the relationship between inflation and debt load does not seem a definitive one .
A more granular look at the various debt load buckets reveals the following : " Over the past two centuries , debt in excess of 90 percent has typically been associated with mean growth of 1.7 percent versus 3.7 percent when debt is low ( under 30 percent of GDP ) , and compared with growth rates of over 3 percent for the two middle categories ( debt between 30 and 90 percent of GDP ) .
Of course , there is considerable variation across the countries , with some countries such as Australia and New Zealand experiencing no growth deterioration at very high debt levels .
It is noteworthy , however , that those high - growth high - debt observations are clustered in the years following World War II . "
A detailed look at the US alone is presented below :
It would be interesting to see the administration reconcile this empirical observation with the current plan of solving any and all economic problem by issuing more debt .
A more pronounced relationships between inflation and debt levels becomes apparent when mapping external debt and GDP growth , inflation :
As one can see , the growth thresholds for external debt are considerably lower than for the thresholds for total public debt .
Growth deteriorates markedly at external debt levels over 60 percent , and further still when external debt levels exceed 90 percent , which record outright declines .
In light of this , it is more understandable that over one half of all defaults on external debt in emerging markets since 1970 occurred at levels of debt that would have met the Maastricht criteria of 60 percent or less .
Inflation becomes significantly higher only for the group of observations with external debt over 90 percent .
To see where the US falls in comparison to other countries when comparing changes in the debt - to - GDP ratio , the authors provide the following chart :
Lastly , and especially for the US , the authors also do a longitudinal analysis of private debt - to - GDP .
The conclusion will not come as a surprise to deflationists : " Just as a rapid expansion in private credit fuels the boom phase of the cycle , so does serious deleveraging exacerbate the post - crisis downturn .
This pattern is illustrated in Figure 7 , which shows the ratio of private debt to GDP for the United States for 1916 - 2009 .
As the box in the figure illustrates , periods of sharp deleveraging tend to associated with much lower growth and higher unemployment .
The magnitude of the current deleveraging episode in the United States has no counterpart in the post - war period .
In varying degrees , the private sector ( households and firms ) in many other countries ( notably both advanced and emerging Europe ) are also unwinding the debt built up during the boom years .
Thus , private deleveraging may be another legacy of the financial crisis that may dampen growth in the medium term . "
The authors ' conclusion should be very carefully considered , especially when the alternative is merely absorbing ludicrous amounts of hopium coming from the administration 's TV actor for any given day :
" A general result of our “ debt intolerance ” analysis , highlights that as debt levels rise towards historical limits , risk premia begin to rise sharply , facing highly indebted governments with difficult tradeoffs .
Even countries that are committed to fully repaying their debts are forced to dramatically tighten fiscal policy in order to appear credible to investors and thereby reduce risk premia ... [ C]ountries that choose to rely excessively on short term borrowing to fund growing debt levels are particularly vulnerable to crises in confidence that can provoke very sudden and “ unexpected ” financial crises .
Similar statements could be made about foreign versus domestic debt , as discussed .
At the very minimum , this would suggest that traditional debt management issues should be at the forefront of public policy concerns ... [ W]e note that even aside from high and rising levels of public debt , many advanced countries , particularly in Europe , are presently saddled with extraordinarily high levels of total external debt , debt issued abroad by both the government and private entities .
In the case Europe , the advanced country average exceeds 200 percent external debt to GDP .
Although we do not have the long - dated time series needed to calculate advanced country external debt thresholds as we do for emerging markets , current high external debt burdens would also seem to be an important vulnerability to monitor . "
With the US hell bent on testing every cautionary statement in the paper , with the debt to GDP ratio likely to surpass the 100 % barrier within a year , we can't wait for the sequel to this paper in the near - future , in which the authors confirm that the U.S. experiment is an abject failure in every aspect of fiscal and monetary policy .

Avatar , the long - awaited science fiction epic from James Cameron will launch this week , but already some lucky individuals have seen the movie .
The same cannot be said of attendees at a 3D preview showing in Germany yesterday though .
The movie 's DRM ' protection ' system failed and the video could not be decoded .
‘ Avatar ’ from Titanic director James Cameron is certainly the most anticipated film of the year .
Set on a moon under siege by humans determined to exploit its resources , this science fiction epic has been in the planning for many years and was even delayed as Cameron waited until the technology became available to realize his dream .
When the movie goes on full release this week the wait will finally be over , but some lucky individuals have already been enjoying advance previews .
Unfortunately the same cannot be said of some who hoped to witness the 3D version of the movie in Germany yesterday , as instead of technology enabling a jaw - dropping extra- dimensional experience , it brought the whole thing to a standstill .
According to a report , 3D digital versions of the movie were delivered to certain cinemas but a problem with their encryption meant that they could not be watched at all the theaters .
The complex DRM system , which involves several certificates and server - delivered time - sensitive keys for hard drives and projectors , failed in a way consistent with the movie ’s epic status .
Unfortunately , after working for several hours cinema workers failed to decrypt 150 gigabytes of data , which resulted in at least one location reverting back to the 2D version .
DRM strikes again , this time in 3D .
“ We regret the failures and the associated discomfort , but we are confident that we will be able to play the premiere both in 2D and in 3D , ” Oliver Fock , general manager of CineStar group said in a comment to the fiasco .
And indeed , according to the latest reports the problems have been fixed just in time for the public premiere .

Hun har fått videresendt en forespørsel fra partikollega Egil Berge som er bekymret for om regjeringen kommer til å stå ved garantiene som var blitt gitt når det gjelder etablering av småkraftverk i Norge .
– Partiet ditt er fortsatt til å stole på
I svaret skriver Størvold :
« Gode partikollega .
Du kan ta det helt med ro .
Det som er sagt fra tidligere statsråder og i stortingmelding nr 11 om at anlegg satt i drift etter 1.1.2004 skal kunne komme inn i ordningen med grønne sertifikat hvis de ellers tilfredsstiller kravene , står fast . (...)
Håper dette var oppklarende .
Og at du nå kan kjenne deg trygg på at partiet ditt fortsatt er til å stole på . »
STOL PÅ SENTERPARTIET : Daværende statssekretær Guri Størvold i Olje - og energidepartementet gjentok garantien regjeringen ikke vil holde .
Foto : Nancy Blundt / NRK
Da hadde både Bondevik II og den første rødgrønne regjeringen med Jens Stoltenberg ved roret gitt samme garanti siden 2003 .
For å motivere folk til å begynne produksjon av fornybar elektrisitet skulle alle som begynte å bygge småkraftverk etter 1 . januar 2004 få være med i en sertifikatordning til tross for at sertifikatmarkedet ikke formelt var opprettet ved byggestart .
Daværende olje- og energiminister Odd Roger Enoksen ( Sp ) hadde sågar lovet alle statlig støtte dersom et elsertifikatmarked ikke kom på plass
Garantien , som ville sikret betydelig bedre strømpris enn småkraftprodusentene får i dag , har regjeringen ingen intensjon om å oppfylle .
Taper millioner
Geir Magnor Olsen innvesterte 40 millioner kroner på garantiene fra staten .
Det får han lide for nå .
– Dette kraftverket hadde aldri blitt bygd uten den erklæringen .
Lærdommen av dette er at man ikke må stole på politikerne .
Han er ikke den eneste .
For stadig flere som har investert i småkraft på bakgrunn av garantiene til ansvarlige myndigheter , trues nå av konkurs .
I et brev fra småkrafteier Bjørn - Ivar Steinslett i Trofors til departementet heter det :
« Jeg og en nabo i Grane realiserte et småkraft - prosjekt i 2005 med bakgrunn i garantien .
Prosjektets utbygningskostnad var på rundt tolv millioner kroner og var finansiert men lånt kapital pluss en enorm egeninnsats .
Vi sitter nå med store private lån og et verk som går tilnærmet i null (...)
Hvis utgiftene og\eller renten øker og\eller strømprisen går ned vil resultatet antageligvis bli konkurs .
Det vil si at både firma og vi privat er konkurs .
Dette er nå blitt et scenario som tar nattesøvnen fra oss . »
Steinslett spør i brevet om hvilken verdi garantien har og om man bare kan skalte og valte med garantier etter eget forgodtbefinnende .
Også han sier at den største feilen han har gjort har vært å stole på politikernes garantier .
– Vi føler oss direkte lurt og føler oss tvunget til å advare alle mot å bygge ut før et permanent system er fysisk på plass , sier Steinslett i brevet .
Daglig leder i Småkraftforeningen , Bjørn Lauritsen , bekrefter at konkursspøkelset lurer for mange av de av hans medlemmer som stolte på garantiene fra 2003 .
– Forholder oss til ny garanti
Statssekretær Robin Kåss i Olje - og energidepartementet bekrefter overfor NRK at regjeringen ikke har noen intensjon om å holde tidligere gitte garantier .
– Uttalelser rundt tidligere garantier knytter seg til tidligere arbeid med forskjellige støtteordninger .
Det vi forholder oss til nå , er den avtalen om et felles grønt elsertifikatmarked som vi har fått på plass med Sverige i september 2009 , og de garantier vi har gitt i forbindelse med den nye avtalen , sier Kåss til NRK .
De garantiene gjør at mer enn 2/3 av småkraftverkene som er etablert mellom 2004 og 2009 ikke får være med i sertifikatmarkedet til tross for tidligere gitte garantier .
GARANTIENE GJELDER IKKE LENGER : Statssekretær Robin Kåss sier gamle garantier ikke gjelder lenger .

– Så det du sier er at alle garantier som er gitt før september 2009 ikke gjelder lenger ?
– Det man må forholde seg til , er de garantiene vi har gitt nå knyttet til den nye avtalen .
Når det gjelder uttalelser knyttet til arbeid med støtteregimer som har vært tidligere , så er det ikke de som gjelder , men den nye avtalen .
– Så de garantiene som har vært gitt fra 2004 til september 2009 er ikke lenger gyldige ?
– De uttalelsene er ikke relevante nå , sier Kåss til NRK .
Dette er den nye garantien
Det som er relevant , er regjeringens nye garanti i forbindelse med etablering av et felles grønt elsertifikatmarked med Sverige som skal være virksomt fra våren 2011 .
Den går ut på at kun kraftverk under 1 MW som er etablert fra 2004 til september 2009 kan nyte godt av de tidligere gitte garantiene .
Det omfatter bare 1/3 av Småkraftforbundets medlemmer , og kun de minste kraftverkene .
Kraftverk som etableres etter september 2009 får fulle garantier lik de tidligere garantiene regjeringen sier de ikke vil holde .
Passionate atheists in New Zealand are copping abuse for their plan to put giant stickers on the sides of buses advising people to stop worrying because there is probably no God .
The atheists want public donations so they can put the stickers on the side of buses in Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch .
The stickers read : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
When similar stickers were put on London 's trains and buses earlier this year , many religious groups were far from happy .
New Zealand spokesman for the atheist bus campaign , Simon Fisher , told Radio New Zealand that he has received a number of abusive emails .
" Quite nasty ones , along the lines of , ' You 're going to hell ' , " he said .
But Mr Fisher says he is not worried .
" For one , I do n't believe in hell , so it 's not too bad . "
He hopes the stickers spark lots of fiery debate and wants them in place by February .
THE brains of monkeys whose mothers had flu while pregnant resemble those of people with schizophrenia .
The finding backs up studies in people that suggest flu in mothers - to - be affects the brain of the developing fetus .
Previous research had found that the children of women who caught flu while pregnant are more likely to develop schizophrenia later in life .
To investigate further , Sarah Short and Chris Coe at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , infected 12 pregnant rhesus monkeys with mild flu .
Their 19 offspring seemed to develop normally .
Yet MRI scans of the 1 - year - old juveniles – equivalent in age …
I have to say that my deepest gloom right now is about how exactly the kind of red-blue , right - left , abstract ideological posturing that has bedeviled the US since Vietnam has come back with a vengeance .
My hope was that Obama could get past this .
He 's trying and his record , to my eyes , is exactly as he promised .
But old habits die hard , and the anger on the left and viciousness on the right seems straight out of a boomer playbook .
I think the right is much more destructive right now , but the Hamsher left is driving me a little nuts as well .
A reader echoes this sense :
My teabagger parents are gloating today about the Brown victory .
To them , this whole politics game is like football : they simply cheer for the red team to beat the blue team .
Period .
They do n’t know or care how Brown or any of their other preferred candidates are going to solve the real crises my generation will face .
And for all their slogans and smugness and phony outrage , the teabaggers are on the wrong side of the future in every way I can imagine : Entitlements will have to be cut .
The eligibility age for Medicare and Social Security will be raised , benefits will be means - tested , and Medicare will eventually be rationed .
Everyone in my generation knows this .
We accept it .
But we want those programs to stick around in at least a minimal , bare - bones form .
The teabaggers just mindlessly shout “ Do n’t cut my Medicare ! ”
But they do n’t mind bankrupting it for my generation .
Taxes will be raised .
This is a fact .
But teabaggers keep demanding tax cuts , insisting that cuts increase revenues , a claim that ca n’t even be called discredited because it was never credible in the first place .
Policy - smart conservatives know it ’s hooey , but teabaggers love it because it ’s a convenient , feel - good talking point , truth be damned .
The rest of our lives will be filled with economic stagnation and profound personal insecurity .
The health care system as we know it will fall apart , spiraling costs will destroy growth , and the government will be forced to take an ever - bigger role in health care , sooner or later .
What it means to be middle - class will be drastically different in fifty years , maybe even twenty .
The disruptions of globalization will require government to alleviate the economic risk on individuals through programs like expanded unemployment benefits , targeted job training ( and re-training ) , and education reforms .
Teabaggers ’ answer ?
Scream “ Socialism ! ” and argue for ending all regulations and social welfare programs .
The theme of the future will be the need to accomplish more with fewer government resources .
This will require a generation of leaders committed to the old - fashioned conservative notion of good government .
For teabaggers , though , it ’s an article of faith that there is no such thing as good government , so they do n’t care what kind of hacks they put in office .
American empire will have to be rolled back .
We ca n’t afford it .
The defense budget must be cut .
But teabaggers just want more and more war , imperial occupations that never end , in every corner of the globe .
You have to wonder if war simply makes them feel good .
Climate change and peak oil are facts .
They will alter our lives in ways that seem like science fiction to us now .
But teabaggers grasp at any flimsy excuse they can find not to face these facts , from “ Al Gore is a hypocrite ! ” to “ Drill , baby , drill ! ” to “ The emails prove it ’s all a hoax ! ”
The ridiculous , exhausting culture war has to end .
My generation is sick of re-fighting Vietnam and Selma and Stonewall .
We do n’t want to be defined by whether we eat arugula or wear Carhartt .
But the teabaggers need the culture war to continue forever because it ratifies their prejudices .
It justifies their hate .
It prevents the change they fear .
Now who is better prepared to start solving these problems now , a pragmatist like Obama or the teabaggers ?
Who is the real small - C conservative ?
If teabaggers continue to stand in the wayor God forbid , if they take powerhow much longer will it take for leaders to emerge who are willing to do the hard work ?
I asked my father what his solution would be .
“ Blow up the whole government , ” he said .
“ I ’m not responsible for your security . ”
If that ’s not nihilism , what is ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

ELSEWHERE IN THE NETWORK :
They actually recreated ‘ Mad Max ’ in the destert … with hot chicks , right here .
“ And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and He took the bone of Adam ’s penis and made him a woman . ”
Er , wait , was n’t it from one of Adam ’s ribs that Eve was created ?
Not according to Ziony Zevit .
A professor of Semitic languages at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles Zevit posits that the Hebrew word tsela ( literally “ side , ” but traditionally translated as “ rib ” ) employed in Genesis refers in fact to Adam ’s member .
Zevit , author of the forthcoming What Really Happened in the Garden of Eden ? , argues that , etiologically , “ rib ” does n’t make much sense in a story pregnant with sexual innuendo ; nor is there precedent in ancient Near Eastern mythology for it to feature as an instrument of creation .
Instead , tsela was likely a euphemism for the baculum , or “ penis bone , ” found in the males of most mammals .
The Bible uses various euphemisms for male genitalia but never a specific word : two of them , “ bone ” and “ flesh , ” in the pertinent verse may be double entendres when Adam welcomes
Eve as “ bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh ” ( Gen. 2:23 ) .
Despite macho boasts of having a “ boner , ” there ’s of course no bone in the human male ’s reproductive organ .
According to John Kaltner , Steven L. McKenzie and Joel Kilpatrick ’s recently published compendium of titillating biblical tidbits , The Uncensored Bible , where Zevit ’s suggestion receives prominent treatment , the authors of Genesis believed that the human male lacked this specific part of his anatomy precisely because the first man ’s had been removed to create Eve .
We already know that the authors of the Bible are hardly trustworthy in matters of biology .
Leviticus , after all , attributes only four , not six , legs to insects and appears to classify bats as birds .
But Zevit ’s interpretation also indicates that scripture is n’t nearly as chaste as we ’re normally led to believe .
Books like The Harlot by the Side of the Road ( 1997 ) by Jonathan Kirsch and The X - Rated Bible ( 1999 ) by Ben Edward Akerley have done much to shed light on scriptural ribaldry .
The Uncensored Bible , written by a pair of Bible scholars at Memphis ’ Rhodes College and a satirist , now furthers the cause with additional examples of sexual escapades unearthed by scholars from beneath the ambiguous expressions and euphemisms of biblical Hebrew .
The new hypotheses come with varying degrees of plausibility ( Was Joseph a drag queen with his “ coat of many colors ” ?
Did Ishmael molest Isaac ? ) , yet on the whole they ensure the Bible is more risqué than ever .
Notwithstanding Bible - thumping puritans who claim scriptural authority for their censorious prudery , the Good Book is replete with lewd metaphors , sexual innuendo , and outright obscenities , often starring some of the Bible ’s most famous characters .
To win the hand of Michal , King Saul ’s daughter , the young David must prove his manliness by performing posthumous circumcision on a hundred slain Philistines .
The episode recalls the ancient Egyptian practice of keeping dead enemies ’ manly appendages as trophies of war .
In a memorable putdown elsewhere , the Prophet Ezekiel derides Egyptians as priapic fornicators whose “ emissions are like those of horses ” ( Ezk. 23:20 ) .
In court we swear to tell the truth with a hand placed on the Bible .
But in the book itself , Jacob , nearing death in Egypt , asks Joseph to swear an oath not to bury him there by “ put[ting ] your hand under my thigh ” ( Gen. 47:29 ) .
Earlier in Genesis , Jacob wrestles with God , who touches “ the hollow of his [ Jacob ’s ] thigh ” ( 32:25 ) .
“ Thigh ” happens to be a biblical euphemism for male genitalia ; it ’s from Jacob ’s “ thigh ” or “ loins ” that his numerous offspring sprang .
The practice of swearing an oath while touching one ’s or someone else ’s testicles was common in the ancient Near East ( Abraham also orders a servant to do just that in Genesis 24:2 ) .
Its linguistic memory survives in our word “ testify ” — testis being the Latin both for “ witness ” and the male generative gland .
Far from being embarrassing anachronisms in a timeless tale , the naughty bits do much to enrich biblical stories by affording us insight into the beliefs and ideas of ancient Israel .
As literary depositories of antiquity ’s customs and beliefs , the biblical texts are fascinating documents .
It ’s when antiquated religious prescriptions and practices are treated as an enduring moral authority that trouble starts .
Taken together , the Bible advocates a rather curious set of “ family values . ”
Take incest .
Adam and Eve ’s sons and daughters could n’t have perpetuated the human race without it .
And while early Israelites prized virginity , they also considered it a mark of hospitality to offer their wives and daughters to male guests for complimentary sexual services , just as it was a father ’s right to sell his daughter to be a “ maid servant ” ( Ex. 21:7 ) .
In the famous story of Sodom , Lot , the nephew of Abraham , volunteers his virgin daughters to placate randy Sodomites seeking to “ know ” his male guests — two angels in disguise , as it happens .
Later , while he’s in a drunken stupor sheltering in a cave after God ’s destruction of Sodom , Lot is raped by these same daughters to “ preserve the seed of our father ” ( Gen. 19:32 ) .
Deuteronomy , meanwhile , prescribes the amputation of a woman ’s hand for grabbing a man ’s family jewels , or “ secrets ” — even those of an attacker as she comes to the rescue of her husband ( Deut. 25:11 - 12 ) .
A biblical scholar , Jerome T. Walsh , has argued that the text in fact stipulates another punishment : the shaving of the offending woman ’s pubic hair to shame her .
Either way , incapacitating an attacker in a tried - and - tested method would seem preferable to letting your husband perish lest you overstep the bounds of propriety .
Not by the lights of the Bible , though .
Not even the most devout can afford to interpret the Bible too literally — selective reading is inevitable .
Yet many people still think that without the Bible ( and religion in general ) , we ’d all be morally adrift in a sea of licentious barbarism .
Judging from many a biblical passage , the reverse is true : sexual civility requires ignoring scripture .
The biblical books were products of their times .
Across the barren lands of the ancient Near East , fertility cults proliferated and erotically - charged fecundity was a mainstay of creation myths .
In a Sumerian epic of the third millennium BCE , the water god Enki fertilizes the land with his ejaculate .
Not to be outdone , the Egyptians ’ hermaphroditic sun god Atem generated lesser deities through masturbation .
In Genesis too , fertility is a divine gift , and infertility a curse .
The Creator ’s first words to Adam and Eve are the instruction to “ be fruitful and multiply ” ( 1:28 ) .
Soon , God also promises Abraham to make him “ exceedingly fruitful ” ( 17:6 ) and orders him to seal their covenant with circumcision — in other words , to tamper with his reproductive organ .
One of my favorite scholarly theories is that the prototype for the idolatrous Israelites ’ Golden Calf may have been Apis the Bull .
Often represented with an enormous wiener in line with the phallic - centrist norms of the time , the Egyptian idol was the centerpiece , so to speak , of a popular cult that incorporated a 40 - day festival , during which female worshippers would expose themselves before his statue in hopes of divinely - assisted conception — a kind of frenzy which , I guess , would help explain the intensity of Moses ’ rage at Mount Sinai .
And let ’s not forget Onan .
An enduring byword for masturbatory tendencies , this son of Judah is condemned to death for “ wast[ing ] his seed . ”
But he was n’t masturbating , an act that is never directly addressed in the Bible ; he was engaging in coitus interruptus , which “ was displeasing to the Lord ” ( Gen. 38:9 - 10 ) , with his dead brother ’s widow out of fraternal obligation .
In the end , it ’s elderly Judah himself who unwittingly impregnates his daughter - in - law when she tricks him into taking her for a prostitute , thereby siring the grand dynasty that leads to David ( and thereon to Jesus ) .
Some family values .
It ’s time to face up to it : Just as the unadulterated originals of popular folk tales collected by the Brothers Grimm were often sadistic , scatological and pornographic ( no , Prince Charming did n’t wake up Sleeping Beauty with just a kiss ) , so too the Bible is no innocent bedtime story .
It is n’t a fount of moral clarity , either .
If you secretly long for those simple " clean your plate ” days of childhood — but do n’t want to actually clean your plate — there ’s a new book for you .
Michael Pollan , the author of " The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , ” has synthesized that tome ’s analysis and explanation into " Food Rules : An Eater ’s Manual . ”
It does n’t get much easier than this .
Each page has a simple rule , sometimes with a short explanation , sometimes without , that promotes Pollan ’s philosophy of getting back to the basics of food ( and food enjoyment ) .
→ Rule No. 1 : Eat food .
He explains that he ’s referring to edible items that have n’t been processed beyond recognition .
A third of the book focuses on this theme .
The second part addresses the type of food people should eat : Mostly plants .
The third part focuses on how much food ( you might be able to see this coming ) :
Not too much .
→ Among the gems :
Be the kind of person who takes supplements — then skip the supplements ( Rule No. 40 ) .
Do n’t eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk ( Rule No. 36 ) .
It ’s not food if it arrived through the window of your car ( Rule No. 20 ) .
Try not to eat alone ( Rule No. 59 ) .
So , if you need simple directions to achieve a more healthful , perhaps more sane way of eating — not a fancy , complex eating plan involving percentage of carbs and timing ( and you also do n’t want to have to read " The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , ” though you think you should ) — this could be your year .
( As for cleaning your plate , he advises against it .
Rule No. 61 . )

The Terminator Salvation Blu-ray disc can be watched with live director commentary tonight .
It 's starting .
Update : McG is making a Terminator 5 . No !

6:05 : Logging into the Warner Bros. BD - Live account now .
6:08 : There 's a Harry Potter one on December 12 , apparently .
6:12 : Trying to figure out how to log into this commentary .
6:12 : Sorry , I may have already had a few beers before this thing started .
6:15 : I think it 's the Director 's Cut disc ...
6:16 : Still loading .
It 's a good thing I saw this movie already .
6:17 : This IS December 5th right ??
Why are there no screenings available ?
6:25 : OK I 'm in .
Had to join the session by joining the invite from an email .
My fault .

6:26 : Strange , it seems to be text only .
I thought this thing was going to have audio .
6:29 : There 's even an option to have Event Audio " on " , but it 's not working .
6:30 : Someone just asked him what 's up with the name " McG "
6:30 : Long silence .
6:31 : He explains his mom actually came up with the idea to call him McG .
6:36 : There we go !
Commenter dishab says I had to change to Linear PCM audio to hear it .
How in the hell would anyone know how to do that ?
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
6:37 : And now either McG is silent , or the audio stream somehow cut out .
But he is talking about how he wanted to be a Laker .
6:39 : This is seriously annoying .
How would a normal person with a PS3 know to flip back and forth between Bitstream and PCM Audio ?
How would they even know what the hell either of those meant ?

6:40 : Do n't get me wrong ; the idea is pretty great .
To have a director give live commentary and answer questions on top of the movie is a good idea .
But this BD - Live implementation is n't any better than it was last year with The Dark Knight .
In fact , I think it may actually be worse now .
Advertisement
6:42 : Here 's a FAQ posted by dishab in the comments in case any of you are having trouble .
6:44 : I 'm restarting the movie to see if that will fix the audio problem .
What makes it even more frustrating is that I got it to work for about 30 seconds .
Advertisement
6:46 : OK , now it works again .
McG is talking about how they wanted to vary up the ethnicities of the survivors .
6:46 : McG : " Where are all the people that hate this movie ?
I want these questions soon . "
Advertisement
6:47 : They 're going to take a break soon .
But before that they 're talking about Moon Bloodgood 's boobies .
6:47 : The transcript on screen seems to be way delayed from what he 's actually saying .
30 - 60 seconds .

6:48 : Five minute break .
And then afterwards some boobies .
6:49 : I think somebody forgot to pause the movie like they did in the Dark Knight screening .

6:50 : It 's just silence and no typing now , but the movie is still playing .
6:53 : It 's starting up again in 30 seconds .
6:53 : They 're back .
Oh they missed the boob scene .
McG says he did n't want to make it the " gratuitous titty shot in a genre film . "
Advertisement
6:54 : He had to cut out some stuff like a screwdriver attack to make it a PG - 13 in the theatrical release .
6:55 : McG just compared his movie to The Dark Knight .
6:57 : Question : how do you feel about making the horrible Charlie 's Angels films ?
Advertisement
6:57 : McG : " I really like those movies .
If you do n't like them you can fuck off . "
6:59 : " I want feedback from the audience if you want another movie or not ? "
7:00 : From the comments the director 's making , it seems like McG is n't really a fan of subtlety .
I do n't want to get too negative or anything ... but yeah .

7:02 : In answering a question about if Robert Patrick ( T - 1000 ) would be in a future movie .
McG said that he might be , if there was a scientist that wanted to model a Terminator after himself .
( Yes , he took that base idea from Terminator 3 , in case you were wondering . )
7:03 : McG just called himself heavyhanded .
7:05 : Question : " What do you want for Christmas . "
7:05 : McG : " Blah blah let go of materialism blah blah spiritual salvation blah blah douche answer . "
It was pretty horrible .

7:06 : I do n't know how long I can deal with McG 's commentary .
7:07 : And now he just compared himself to Alfred Hitchcock .
7:10 : You know when you 're listening to a stupid person try and use big words he does n't know the meaning of and end up using similar - sounding words that are totally different ?
This is like that .

7:10 : You know when you 're listening to a shallow person try to come up with some profound things to say , but fails miserably and sounds stupid ?
Yup .
This is that .
7:13 : The moderators are picking only the positive comments to give to McG to talk about .
Advertisement
7:13 : He just announced that he 's making another Terminator movie .
Seriously .
7:15 : Here 's a tip that will go down in history from one of the film greats .
" There 's two elements that go into filmmaking .
There 's sound , and there 's the picture . "

7:16 : Oh and for those people who are punching themselves in the face that he 's making another one ?
He said he 's making one after that .
7:19 : McG just confessed to verbal abuse from his father when he was growing up .
7:21 : And now McG is being coy about making another one ?
I do n't get it .
7:22 : McG says he only saw one episode of the Sarah Connor chronicles .
And he did n't " pay attention " to the third movie .
No wonder none of this shit lined up with the third movie .

7:23 : It 's also unfortunate that the main two characters have the names John and Kate .
7:24 : And now he 's talking about a second or third movie again .
7:24 : I 'm doing this for you , by the way , readers .
Normally I would have turned this off an hour ago .

7:25 : Words , words , words .
He 's using a lot of words to say very little .
7:27 : And now the audio is cutting in and out .
I actually like it more this way .
7:28 : Here 's a good comment from djbneozen :
Do you have to be really really full of yourself to be a director for a major Hollywood production nowadays ?
I 'll just say it right now ; T4 ... not that great .
The movie lacked substance .
No wonder they are n't really talking about it directly .
I mean , specificly about what was going on in different scenes , why it was shot from this angle or that angle or what they may have cut from the movie .
You know , discussing the " directing " choice in the movie with the DIRECTOR .
Batman , on the other hand , spectacular .
Jason ... by the attitude of McG , I bet he had a lot more beer than you tonight .
7:30 : They paused the movie to figure out the technical difficulties .
Namely , the no audio - ness of what 's going on right now .

7:32 : You know , I think this movie is the only movie I 've ever seen that was actually better when watched on the back of 7 - inch airplane seat screen .
7:33 : Now I have to restart the movie since the audio 's still messed up .
7:34 : Apropos of nothing , I just got a spam text talking about debt relief .
7:36 : Anyone else like Community with Joel McHale ?
My favorite new show of the season .

7:37 : OK audio is back .
I wonder what stupid comments I just missed int he last 5 minutes .
7:37 : Aaaaaaand he 's talking about Hitler .
7:38 : McG says once the T800 goes out , it 's " curtains " for the resistance .
7:43 : Wow , McG just dissed the third movie .
Seriously ?
" We just tried to introduce credibility . "
Holy .
Fuck .
He thinks his movie is better than the third movie .

7:44 : McG asked viewers who did n't like the third act , and it was all positive .
Hell , I even liked the third act , because it meant the movie was ending soon .
7:46 : He says Sarah Connor is going to be in the next film , but he 's not sure how he 's going to pull that off .

7:47 : McG just says he loves what he does .
Well , if I were a horrible director ( I am ) and got handed the reigns of a beloved franchise , I 'd love it too .
7:48 : McG : " I 'm disappointed in myself that I could n't make the best movie . "
Holy shit .
He just said he thought he could make a better movie than # 1 or # 2 .

7:49 : Someone asked if McG could use Christian Bale in another one of his movies , what would it be ?
McG then talks about how it 's good to work with Christian .
And then babbles for three minutes before not answering the question .
7:52 : McG talks about how he could have made a " dark ending " and ended the franchise by having [ spoiler ]
Connor wake up from the transplant and shoot everyone else .
Then it fades to black and the franchise is done .

7:53 : THE MOVIE IS OVER !
THE MOVIE IS OVER !!!
7:53 : Thanks for reading everyone .
I hope this was at least somewhat entertaining for you , as painful as it was for me .
It 's time to go break this Blu-ray disc so I 'll never have to hear McG 's voice again .
Good night .
The unintended consequence of this week 's media coverage of mephedrone , a legal drug openly sold on the internet which may be implicated in the death of Gabrielle Price , a 14 - year - old girl who collapsed at a party in Brighton last month , is that lots of suppliers have sold out .
Several I call do n't have any in stock .
" We 've had loads of free publicity , " says one .
You must be pleased , I say .
" You think I 'm pleased that kids are buying a potentially dangerous drug ? " he says angrily , then puts the phone down .
Which is a curious response when he is the one supplying them , but then he , like many other mephedrone sellers , seem to exist in a strange world of non-truths .
You can buy mephedrone over the internet with a credit card and have your little bag of white powder delivered the next day ( or on the same day in some areas ) , although when you buy it , you do so on the understanding that it is " not for human consumption " – which every website selling it will tell you – and is instead a plant fertiliser .
" I sell strictly for horticultural use , " says one supplier .
" A lot of orders are for just a few grams , so this is obviously intended for the customer 's own garden . "
Right .
Even though what they are doing is not strictly against the law – under medicines legislation , it is illegal to sell mephedrone for human consumption , but not for customers ' gardens – they really are a wary lot .
One only agrees to speak by email and under condition of anonymity after deciding not to meet me at a service station just north of London after all .
Michael is 39 , runs three small " regular " businesses and used to be an IT director for a retail chain .
He set up a website selling mephedrone , imported from China , three months ago .
" Someone mentioned it in passing and I was intrigued , " he says .
" I knew it was an opportunity and I realised on the first day it was going to be a success .
Now , I 'm seeing silly growth , 10 to 20 % every week . "
This week he put his prices up , mainly to try to stem the interest because he was receiving more orders than he could handle .
He makes all his sales through his website – " I 've heard of a few cases recently of robberies taking place at sales meet - ups " – so he says it is hard to know who is buying mephedrone , but he does supply bulk orders to people who clearly plan to sell it on .
He says he can almost see it spreading throughout the country .
" A month ago it reached London , " he says .
" I went from rare orders there to a lot .
A week ago it reached Manchester and Birmingham .
I was wondering why I never got orders from there , but now there are suddenly lots . "
Does he take it ?
" No , never have and never will . "
Last month , the European Union 's drug agency found the UK was the European capital for the online trade in legal highs – nearly half of the websites selling these drugs are based here .
Tackling legal highs is a growing challenge for governments .
Synthesised in laboratories , often based in China , to mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines , they fall outside most drug control laws and are openly sold online or in " headshops " , those dingy stores you find in most towns that smell of incense and sell smoking paraphernalia and cannabis seeds labelled as " souvenirs " .
Mephedrone , which also has street names including meow ( after its shortened chemical name MM - cat ) , is cheap , easy to buy , and does n't come with the risk of a criminal record .
Its status as a " legal high " gives it an air of safety , though this could be misleading .
One user tells me it really took off this year among regular drug users because it has become harder to find MDMA , and mephedrone , which gives similar effects such as a sense of euphoria and energy , filled that void .
Maggie , a 20 - year - old student from London , says , " I 've done mephedrone a few times at house parties and club nights .
I did n't have that much of a comedown the day after , but I felt spaced out and a bit stupid – I could n't do any work for a few days . "
Another student in London says he is planning to buy mephedrone in bulk now so he can sell it on when it becomes illegal – as most predict it will – and make a profit .
Ask people – from users to medical and drugs experts – whether it is safe and they will tell you they just do n't know .
It is the illegal aspect of other drugs that is putting people at risk by encouraging them to seek out legal drugs instead , says Professor David Nutt , who was the chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) until he was sacked in October by the home secretary , Alan Johnson , for criticising government drugs policy .
" I know it 's controversial to say it , but people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those we know nothing about , " he says .
" Who knows what 's in [ mephedrone ] when you buy it ?
We do n't have a testing system .
It could be very dangerous , we just do n't know .
These chemicals have never been put into animals , let alone humans . "
Nutt first became aware of mephedrone a year ago , and he says " legal highs " are something he has been concerned about for a while .
More reports , particularly from music festivals this summer , of its use and often frightening side effects started to reach the ACMD , bolstered by reports from hospitals , the police and researchers who take an interest in what gets put into amnesty bins in clubs .
On an internet drugs forum , where thousands of people from all over the world share information and experiences , mephedrone users report experiencing vomiting , nosebleeds ( the drug is often snorted ) , chest pains and high heart rate , breathing problems and panic attacks .
One user describes how it turned him blue , another describes " electric shocks in the head " .
One user writes about a friend going to hospital after taking it and finding the emergency doctors had never heard of mephedrone and did n't know about its effects or how to treat them .
The theme throughout many of the threads is the unknown risk aspect .
Mephedrone has already been banned in Sweden ( where it was linked to the death of a young woman last year ) , Denmark and Israel .
A spokeswoman for the Home Office says " the ACMD are looking into [ mephedrone ] as a priority as part of their review into legal highs .
They will report back next year and their advice will inform our response " .
This month , three " legal highs " – BZP , GBL and a cannabis substitute known as spice – will be banned after they were linked to several deaths .
But banning individual substances long after they have appeared does n't seem like a reasonable long - term response to legal highs , which are easily and quickly manufactured and distributed on the internet .
Nutt believes we should follow the model adopted in New Zealand , whereby new drugs are immediately put into a new " class D " category , where it is not illegal to sell or possess but its effects are monitored .
" The manufacturers and suppliers can define the dosage , do quality control , make sure it is not contaminated .
You can also monitor sales and use this data to see how much is out there – from that you can work out the use / harm ratio . "
Nutt proposed this to the government as a way of dealing with legal highs in the first instance .
" They turned it down .
They said they did n't want to take that route at the moment ; they wanted to legislate for specific compounds . "
Martin Barnes , chief executive of Drugscope , the national drugs information charity , says " we should avoid panicky , knee - jerk responses .
To respond that the law should ban [ mephedrone ] is a blunt instrument .
The important issue is education ; people need to have access to reliable information .
At the moment , it is all word - of - mouth and what people read on internet chat rooms . "
As for the suppliers , the feeling appears to be that a ban is inevitable .
" I think mephedrone will be made illegal within a year , but there will be other products that will replace it , " says Michael .
Recipes change – new drugs are made by tweaking a molecule here or there – sidestep the law .
" The law will always be one product behind the market . "

Next time you go into a department store , look for a couple of things : signposts ( detailing where items are located throughout the store ) , cashiers ( ready to assist you should you have any questions ) , and muzak ( that oh - so - good , yet oh - so - bad “ elevator music ” ) .
Do you think you would find them ?
I imagine so .
They ’re usually not hard to spot .
The point of this exercise is n’t the visibility / audibility of these things , but their utility in a different sense .
These are the elements of the retail experience that do n’t serve a “ vital ” function .
They ’re not essential to the practice of buying and selling goods .
Retail stores could function just fine without signposts , cashiers , and background music .
In fact , stores do n’t require design in any explicit sense .
Yet we expect to see design , regardless of the store we enter .
Our societal notion of a good retail store is defined in large part by what has worked ( and what has n’t ) over the course of iterative experience design .
In other words , the elements I highlighted above are so engrained into our definition of a contemporary retail store ( and how we interact with it ) that we measure other retail experiences by them , even when two stores are functionally the same .
These are the sorts of elements which make up ambient user experience , the experiences that subtly align with user expectations .
Ambient user experience is design applied to the context in which users get things done in the course of using a website .
Providing a good experience on our websites , in turn , means incorporating elements of ambience .
If done correctly others will catch on , and your experience will define ones that follow .
How we experience
Even “ novel ” ways of interacting with the world are themselves tempered by previous experiences .
My own assumptions regarding retail stores are colored from my upbringing in suburban America .
There is an implicit agreement between me and the culture I live in , that we both understand what it means to be a retail store .
If a pair of scissors works , it works .
Why then , are there 25 kinds of scissors available at my local office - supply store ?
The answer is n’t straightforward .
Experience designers are tasked with more than just making sure a product is functionally sound ; they must design for the context in which that product is used , its interaction possibilities .
If an interaction does n’t account for these kinds of possibilities , the user is forced to account for them —users are forced to answer their own questions .
Good ambient experience is based on expectation , accounting for these kinds of things before they ’re evident .
A good source of what makes up ambient user experience is Yelp.com , a website where people post emotionally charged responses to local businesses .
Not surprisingly , users of Yelp do n’t comment on the specific functionality of a restaurant or local business ; they comment on their overall experience .
In an excerpt from Magdalena C.’s 5 –star review of Studio 924 Hair Designs , she says :
The people working there are funny , friendly , listen really carefully , and are n’t afraid to ask questions and make sure they understand what you want .
You get a scalp massage with every haircut , and the products they use work well and smell wonderful .
Magdalena C. ’s review on Yelp.com
Magdelenda does n’t care about the quality of the scissors that her stylist uses , nor does she name the hair care products that line Studio 924 ’s shelves .
Instead , her haircare experience is colored by something altogether tangential to the elements that deliver a functionally good haircut .
General ambient experience on the Web
So too , users come to our websites with expectations of how they will interact with them — not only the functionality of the website itself ( if I click this button , it will submit that form ; if I sign up for this invoicing software , I ’ll be able to send invoices ) , but also of the experiences they are likely to have .
Some of the expected elements of web ambience include :
Global navigation : show me where to go
Most websites have more content than will reasonably fit on one page .
As such , they will need a logical way to browse through that content .
Users frequently look to the top of a webpage for global navigation .
Good global navigation is logical , consistent , and rigorous .
Search : let me help myself
If users know exactly what they want or are just confused / confounded by the navigation that is provided , they will expect the ability to conduct a search of the website .
Search has become so ubiquitous that it ’s been integrated into all of the major browsers .
It ’s no wonder that users expect similar functionality inside of our websites .
Reciprocity : where there is output let there be input .
Borrowing this idea from Theresa Neil , many users will expect the ability to edit / input / delete data via the same interface by which they view content .
Said another way , there should n’t be any major difference in the way content is created from the way it is edited and viewed .
Although the interface is distinct programmatically , the mental model is nearly identical to the unassuming user .
Your interface should reflect this .
These three ideas — navigation , search , and reciprocity — might sound like “ givens ” to web designers / developers that have worked for any significant amount of time in the field .
Yet , everyday , people commit UX faux pas .
If we ’re to elevate the state of experience design on the web we need to make sure that we ’re all on the same page .
How you can get started
Users wo n’t ask for ambiance explicitly unless its essential to the functionality of your product or service .
If a user ca n’t checkout on your eCommerce site , they ’ll “ ask ” for a checkout link during user testing .
Whereas if providing users with subtotals would be helpful , but does n’t serve as a detriment to the functionality of the site , it may never show up in usability tests .
As a consequence , what people perceive as “ nice to have ” on our websites is never codified in any meaningful way — yet a large part of our user experience depends on it .
Therefore , it ’s up to user experience / interaction designers to strategize and compare our results .
We need to level the playing field .
Experience designers should setup the context of the sites they ’re improving upon in a similar fashion .
One great way to do this is to make use of interaction design frameworks .
Just as we have a number of functional / experiential expectations of retail stores and phone - support systems , so too do users have functional / experiential expectations of eCommerce sites and social networking sites .
Fortunately , for those new to interaction design frameworks , New Riders has just published a fantastic book that covers the basics Web Anatomy : Interaction Design Frameworks that Work , written by Jared Spool and Robert Hoekman , Jr. This provides a high - level overview of what an IxD framework is , how to apply it to your design process , and what it means for the designers , developers , and end - users involved .
Next , elevate the experience .
Carefully peruse personas , user flows , and your website ’s design strategy ( if yours merits one ) to get into the minds of the people using your website .
Ask yourself “ how can I help the user accomplish X ? ”
Even if you ’re only making something clearer or providing a more subtle transition between application states , your users will appreciate that your website goes that extra mile .
Moving forward : crowdsourcing experiences
If enough people use your great idea , it increases the likelihood of success .
Not only of the memetic nature of your experience , but in the long - term viability of your product .
If we look back at websites with markedly unique experiences ( Google Maps , 37 Signal ’s Basecamp , and Google Wave , for instance ) , we see innovation .
The experiences that these websites provided were unlike any other , and other experience designers capitalized on that .
The best practices that you ’ve established will come to form a more universal definition of what it means to provide a good ambient experience within the context of your interaction design framework .
While no popular , user - driven review community exists for the ambient experience of websites , experience and interaction designers do take notice of how other websites function ; it ’s our nature .
If you ’re feeling lost or looking for inspiration , checkout EmberApp .
There , a community of interaction designers are actively sharing the websites and applications that they find innovative and inspiring .
And lastly , as always , keep active .
Most websites will never get the kind of review that users on Yelp provide .
Our medium is simply too esoteric right now .
The real discussion of how ambient experience ’s are created happens offline , inside experience designer ’s minds .
Work at it .
The Web ’s experiences are crafted by user experience designers that think outside of the box , creating those subtle differences that turn forgettable websites into unforgettable ones .

This entry was in no small part inspired by Eric Meyer ’s talk Javascript will save us all at An Event Apart San Francisco .
In his presentation , Eric noted that any code - wielding standardista has the power to evolve our collective medium .
For example , if someone wants to propose a new ( potentially better ) way to define border radius , they can create a working version of it that works across all major user agents with a combination of stylesheets and javascript .
It did n’t take a genius to see how this selfsame logic works with user experiences .
Thanks , Eric ; and thanks to everyone who made An Event Apart San Francisco such a smashing success .

Paul Bettany , the British actor and lucky husband of Jennifer Connelly who plays Charles Darwin in the new movie Creation , is loudly proclaiming himself an atheist in a very quiet public place .
“ I wish I did have faith .
I think it would make life so much easier .
I just have not discovered God in my life .
I mean , I do n’t see him .
It ’s not that I ’m closed off to the argument , but I do feel the burden of proof . ”
Of course , this public place — the Hall of Human Origins in the American Museum of Natural History — does offer a certain protection from unsympathetic , prying ears .
Not too long ago , though , Bettany stood in a nearly identical room where such statements ( coming from the albino villain of The Da Vinci Code , no less ) might have had a more incendiary effect .
“ I went to the Creation Museum in Kentucky in a fit of openness , thinking , God , I should really see the other side , ” he says .
“ It ’s bananas !
“ It was so monumentally peculiar and sad , actually .
It ’s sort of set out to look like a museum of science , but of course there ’s no science in it .
There ’s a lot of statements , particularly about how scientists have difficulty explaining why tortoises are on all sides of the globe . ”
He points out that scientists do not have any difficulty explaining such things .
“ But if you believe that Noah landed on Mount Ararat , you have to come up with the explanation which is , after the flood , obviously there were a lot of trees ripped up and they formed into rafts .
And I guess once when Noah was looking the other way getting some kangaroos off , these tortoises got onto the raft and they turned up in the Galápagos .
I mean , how else did these things travel across oceans , unless massive rafts were made by the trees ? ”
He pauses .
“ Which does beg the question why more humans did n’t survive . ”
Bettany had been a Darwin fan long before he saw the Creation script , which centers on the scientist ’s domestic life , including the loss of his daughter Annie and the dilemma he faced living with a devoutly religious wife while publishing a book that bolsters the arguments of atheists .
But despite doing oodles of research , he had to accept that “ as a shallow blond actor , ” he ’d never grasp what went on in Darwin ’s mind .
He could , however , try to look the part .
So he shaved the top of his head and wore wigs depicting Darwin ’s varying amount of hair over the twenty years he worked on On the Origin of Species .
This proved more difficult to handle than he ’d anticipated : “ I do n’t think of myself as a particularly vain human being .
I think if I was going bald , I ’d just go , ‘ Oh , I ’m bald . ’
But when you ’re not going bald and people go , ‘ Oh , are you ? ’
And you go , ‘ No , I ’m not !
I ’m absolutely not bald . ’
It was weirdly challenging . ”
He also had to put on 45 pounds in part because in the film , Darwin believes in a pseudo - scientific wellness treatment called hydrotherapy , which required Bettany to take a basin shower onscreen and look more Darwin ’s weight than his own .
“ I was indeed a fat bastard , ” he says .
Fortunately , “ I do n’t really think my wife noticed .
She laughed at my hair , but she does n’t really notice when I ’m in shape .
It bodes well for the future .
She ’ll stay with me and I ’ll leave her in a heartbeat if she goes bald and fat . ”
Connelly also stars in the movie as Darwin ’s wife , making this the first time she and Bettany have acted together .
( They did n’t share any scenes in A Beautiful Mind , the movie on which they met . )
Bettany adored the experience , especially since being married gave them a kind of emotional shorthand that ’s often hard to portray on film .
Not the gooey - eyed kind , either .
“ There ’s actually a lot of ignoring each other that goes on in real marriages . ”
For a period - piece science movie that features graphic nature scenes involving maggots , Connelly ’s presence may be its best chance to pull in an audience .
“ I ’ve got no doubts that she is the bigger draw , ” says Bettany , “ and no ego attached to it .
Darwin is a hard sell , even in my country , and that ’s where Darwin came from . ”
Bettany passes by a glass case filled with carefully labeled butterfly and beetle specimens .
“ Poor Alfred , ” he says with a smile .
“ I always feel sad about Alfred [ Russel ] Wallace .
He ’s sort of forgotten by history .
So it ’s nice that somebody has his stuff . ”
Wallace , he explains , was living in the Spice Islands and came to the same conclusions as Darwin .
“ He sent him a letter with a sort of summary of his theory of the mechanism of natural selection , and Darwin went , ‘ Fuck ! ’ and published finally after twenty years . ”
So , why did n’t he make a movie about poor , forgotten Wallace instead ?
“ If I ca n’t get a movie about Darwin seen … ”
A museum employee comes up and gives Bettany tickets to come back and see an Imax movie with his family .
After this , Bettany says , he ’s picking up the kids from school , and then he ’s got a bunch of apocalyptic scripts to work through .
( Bettany ’s other new movies include Legion , in which he plays the archangel , and Priest , which has him hunting down vampires . )
“ A large percentage of scripts I get offered have that sort of theme .
And , you know , a boy ’s got to work . ”
Besides , “ I am quite shallow and I get bored very quickly , so whilst I ’m making a small , heartfelt movie about Charles Darwin , I ’m thinking , Fuck , I should really go kill some vampires in the next film .
I ’d think that perhaps Darwin ’s ideas would have been more broadly accepted at the time had he had an AK - 47 Kalashnikov assault rifle .
That would ’ve been survival of the fittest . ”

Acccording to a poll carried out by the Institute for Advertising Research Softbank ’s Shirato Family series of commercials have been voted most popular with Japanese audiences for the third year running .
To decide the nation ’s favorite ad , the institute interviewed 3,000 respondents , ages 6 to 89 .
The campaigns in second and third place also came from cell - phone companies : KDDI and NTT DoCoMo , respectively .
Fourth place went to Lotte for their extremely successful
Fit ’s viral - video dance campaign , which featured a catchy song - and - dance routine and challenged viewers to perform the dance themselves and upload it to YouTube .
Much of the success of the Shirato campaign has been attributed to the charms of pop idol / actress Aya Ueto ( who plays the family ’s younger sister character ) , but what really makes the commercials stand out is that , despite its depiction of a “ typical ” Japanese family , the women rule the roost , otousan ( father ) just happens to be a white dog and onisan ( elder brother ) is played by African - American actor Dante Carver .
Foreigners are traditionally depicted in advertisements in Japan as being set apart from cultural mores of Japanese society ( and even though he loves Japan , McDonald ’s Mr. James is no exception ) .
In most case the foreigners behave outrageously , often to comic effect .
Softbank ’s onisan , however , is very much a part of the family , speaking fluent Japanese , teasing onesan about her boyfriends and even dreaming of overseas travel to exotic places like Hawaii .
As for the dog , the joke is that despite his gruff and strict tone , otousan is soooooo cute .
This is pure conjecture , of course , but we wonder whether the concept for the family came from Softbank ’s CEO , Masayoshi Son , who despite being third - generation Korean was n’t officially considered Japanese until his family adopted the Japanese name Yasumoto .
Japanese with Korean ethnicity often face discrimination in Japan , so the commercial could be seen as a having a little fun with the whole concept of what it means to be Japanese .
Despite discrimination that he faced when first trying to set up his business , Son has became hugely successful and is now the richest man in Japan .
Another gaijin face also appeared in the series recently : Quentin Tarantino playing the part of uncle Tara .
Wearing a traditional Japanese attrie Tarantino waves his arms around and screeches “ Samurai spirit ” before his scary blond wife summons him on the dog speaker - phone to get his butt home pronto , at which point he bows and apologizes .
The joke being that the ferocious samurai is obviously henpecked , thus inverting more traditional Japanese values ( and it dovetails nicely with Tarantino ’s own girl power aesthetic ) .
While some people have suggested this performance might be beneath the dignity of America ’s great auteur , we wager that Tarantino , a hardcore Japanophile , was probably chuffed to make an appearance in Japan ’s most popular commercial .
They found the joke funny in Delhi
By Chris Morris
BBC News , Delhi
" In Bangalore you can party like a rock star . "
Pause .
" Until ten - thirty at night . "
It probably would n't have them rolling in the aisles in London or Los Angeles , but if all politics is local , then so is a great deal of comedy .
And a new craze is beginning to sweep urban India - stand - up comedy .
In English .
On stage in a small open - air auditorium is Papa CJ , an Indian comedian who 's appeared regularly on the British comedy circuit .
" What you 've got to manage in the Indian audience is some of the hypocrisy .
People are very conscious of who is looking at me laugh at what , " he says .
Even for him , this is relatively new territory .
For Indian audiences more than anywhere else , it 's all about knowing where the lines have to be drawn .
" But it 's fascinating because it's at such a nascent stage , " Papa CJ says .
The only reason I got inspired to really do stand - up is that I sat in the audience and heard all this female bashing
Devika
" So it 's almost your job to dance on that line - step across and come back , step across and come back - and ask ' are you OK with that ? ' "
And it 's not just established stand - ups who are clambering up on stage .
At an open -mic night in a Delhi bar , the drinks are flowing , there are some fairly risque jokes being told , and a woman has just started singing on stage about the infamously bad attitude of the Indian man .
Devika is a lawyer by day and a would - be comedienne at night .
And her inspiration ?
Breaking a few taboos .
" The only reason I got inspired to really do stand - up is that I sat in the audience and heard all this female bashing , and more female bashing , " she laughs .
" It went on and on and finally I said ' you know what ?
I can give an answer to that .
Let me get up and do it . ' "
There is of course a huge comedy scene in India already - Hindi comedy in the north , Tamil comedy in the south , a dozen other regional linguistic laughs and a long Bollywood tradition of slapstick .
Political pitfalls
But some things do n't translate well , as India 's deputy foreign minister Shashi Tharoor found out recently .
On his twitter page he said he was flying cattle class in solidarity with all our holy cows .
Cattle ?
Cows ?
Can be a sensitive subject in India .
Many people were n't amused , and Mr Tharoor was briefly inundated with calls to recant or resign .
" The problem with a politician trying to be funny , " he admits ruefully , " is that you have to be funny across all these linguistic divides or else you come a cropper .
And that 's what happened to me .
" I think I 've had a very , very hard lesson on why it is that Indian politicians are not renowned for their sense of humour . "
Anuvab Pal describes an emerging upper - middle class and urban humour Indians love a joke and a laugh as much as anyone else , but this is a large and complex country with multiple layers of language and development .
" The things you can say in private to an audience who might understand the context , " Shashi Tharoor concludes , " are very different to what you can say in this vast public space of multi-lingual India . "
And there are still plenty of subjects which would cause a pretty sharp intake of breath - caste and religion immediately spring to mind .
But parts of India are learning to laugh at themselves in a much more liberal way .
" I think there 's an upper - middle class , urban , Indian sense of humour emerging , " says Anuvab Pal , a successful playwright and screenplay writer .
" Thirty to forty million people , cosmopolitan , well - travelled and fairly exposed to Western comedy . "
He runs through a list - Friends or Frasier , Seinfeld or The Office .
" That kind of comedy is pouring out into stand - up comedy clubs , " he adds , " and I think in aspirational cities like Delhi they 'll all talk about it .
It becomes a thing .
And if you can make it like that , they 'll laugh . "
In other words , English language comedy is reflecting a young Indian elite , with plenty of money to spend .
The Comedy Store - a British institution - is soon opening in Mumbai , and other comedy clubs are springing up to take advantage of the new trend .
This is still a conservative country .
But in so many ways it 's becoming more open to the wider world .

The portrait by Maurice Quentin de La Tour has become an iconic image The National Galleries of Scotland has conceded its portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie is probably actually of his younger brother Henry .
The painting , by Maurice Quentin de La Tour , has hung in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery since it was bought for £ 22,000 in 1994 .
Now a leading expert believes the pastel might be Prince Henry Benedict instead of Charles Edward Stuart .
The gallery said it was not uncommon for re-attributions to be made .
It follows a two - year row over the identity of the man in the painting since London art dealer Bendor Grosvenor claimed it was not Bonnie Prince Charlie .
At first the gallery dismissed the claim citing expert on Jacobite portraiture , Dr Edward Corp of the University of Toulouse , France , in its defence .
However , Dr Corp has now changed his opinion in an article in the latest issue of The British Art Journal .
He said : " ' The weight of evidence , perhaps regrettably , supports Bendor Grosvenor 's argument that the pastel in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery shows Prince Henry rather than Prince Charles . "
Historical figure
He added : " ' Whether the portrait does or does not show Prince Charles really does matter .
" It is not merely the catalogue of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery which needs to be corrected .
" The impression which an entire nation has derived of this important historical figure should also be changed .
" The portrait is now reproduced in all biographies of the prince , and has been selected to illustrate the article about him in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography . "
A scent bottle , 1753 , showing the lost portrait of Prince Charles Stuart A National Galleries of Scotland : " In the light of this development , we have re-assessed our own position and , on balance , accept that it is more likely that our pastel depicts Prince Henry Benedict , and not his elder brother .
" It is not uncommon that such re-attributions are made , as research continues to fill in gaps in our knowledge , and it is always exciting to uncover new information about the works in our care .
" None of these debates detract from the greatness of the portrait .
" As an image it still projects the glamour of the Stuart cause , it is simply that we must readjust to seeing Henry , always rather in the shadow of his brother , in this role , rather than Charles . "
A description about the controversy surrounding the picture will be attached when it goes back on show at the gallery in two years ' time following a revamp of the building .

In addition , I suggest that one of the ways I often use the term " atheist activist " is not captured by the above definition at all - one who works to
So what is an atheist activist , and what is atheist activism ?
I 'd like to suggest something along these lines :
Atheist activism refers to the process of promoting atheism through activities such as promoting a worldview free from gods , reducing the privileged status of religion in society , and promoting atheist civil rights .
Use of the " such as " phrase reminds us that these are merely examples of how an atheist activist might promote atheism , none of which is a necessary condition .
The essential feature would be the promotion of atheism ( i.e. , I can not think of a form of atheist activism that in no way involves the promotion of atheism ) .
Similarly , if asked whether someone could be an atheist activist without " working to change the world into one without religion , " I 'd likely say yes .
While most people I would consider atheist activists certainly work to reduce the political influence of religion , I do not think that they necessarily must seek the abolition of religion .
In addition , I suggest that one of the ways I often use the term " atheist activist " is not captured by the above definition at all - one who works to promote atheist equality .
However , while I consider this an important form of atheist activism , I do not view it as an essential part of the definition .
So what is an atheist activist , and what is atheist activism ?
I 'd like to suggest something along these lines : Use of the " such as " phrase reminds us that these are merely examples of how an atheist activist might promote atheism , none of which is a necessary condition .
The essential feature would be the promotion of atheism ( i.e. , I can not think of a form of atheist activism that in no way involves the promotion of atheism ) .
What does atheist activism mean to you ?
Greta Christina recently defined atheist activism as " trying to persuade people that atheism is correct and working to change the world into one without religion . "
Does that capture what you think of when you encounter the term ?
This is n't what I usually mean by atheist activism , at least not completely .
Could someone be an atheist activist if this person does not try to persuade others than atheism is correct ?
Yes .
This part of Greta Christina 's definition does not strike me as essential for atheist activism .
One could be an atheist activist without attempting to de-convert others .
Physicists working in space plasmas have made clever use of the Ulysses spacecraft and the solar minimum to create a massive virtual lab bench to provide a unique test for the science underlying turbulent flows .
Researchers have an ideal mathematical model of turbulence in fluids ( ideal because the model is of an infinitely large flow ) .
They also have been able to measure how such turbulence builds over time by measuring how that turbulent flow of material fluctuates as it crosses or hits a boundary wall in small confined boxes within a lab .
However , until now , researchers have not had access to a means of carrying out much more large scale experiments to test the ideal turbulence .
However University of Warwick plasma astrophysicists Professor Sandra Chapman and Dr Ruth Nicol have found a particularly elegant solution to fill that experimental gap employing Ulysses spacecraft and two solar minimum to map the turbulence in the energies of the turbulence in the solar wind – a magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) flow .
Normally the ‘ noise ’ from violent eruptions on the sun would disturb the turbulent flow .
Ulysses ’ controllers had cleverly contrived for the spacecraft to pass over each of the Sun ’s poles during two different solar minima making it possible not only to gather data but also to be able to compare two different energy levels in a turbulent flow .
The level of turbulence is down by a factor of 2 in the most recent solar minimum compared with the previous one .
The spacecraft was able to record the state of the turbulent flows flowing past it at 750 kms a second at a distance of up to 2.83 Astronomical units from the Sun .
This in effect allowed the spacecraft to record the developing turbulence as a flowed up to the satellite ’s position which then became like a weir in space creating a virtual confined laboratory box to test the development of flows over a time – but a confined box which was over 200 million miles in size .
The spacecraft orbited over the Sun ’s poles at two very different solar minima with clear differences in energy levels that could have created two very different forms of developing turbulence in the Solar Wind .
However the researchers were surprised to find clear similarities in the measurements of the two “ different ” solar winds at each of the solar minima despite the fact that there was a significant difference in the energy levels of the solar wind during the two different solar minima ( 17 % lower plasma density and 15 % lower magnetic field in the later solar minimum )
They found that in all the polar passes of the spacecraft the evolution of turbulence in the Solar wind was governed by the same generalised scaling function no matter how much energy was in the system .
This suggest that there is a universal basic property governing the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence over finite distances - in this case a finite distance of over 200 million miles .
Professor Sandra Chapman also said “ These results are not just an interesting piece of astrophysics or turbulence research as the work has been produced in the University of Warwick ’s ‘ Centre for Fusion , Space and Astrophysics ’ and the results have also immediately come to the attention of our colleagues interested in how turbulence evolves in confined plasmas on earth – which will someday generate fusion energy .
Turbulence is a big problem for colleagues interested in keeping the hot plasma confined long enough for burning to take place to generate fusion power and this may give those colleagues some valuable new insights . “
Palestinians inspect fire damage at the Yasuf mosque
A mosque in a village in the north of the Israeli - occupied West Bank has been damaged in an arson attack .
Attackers set fire to bookshelves and a large area of carpet in the mosque , and sprayed graffiti in Hebrew on a wall .
Palestinian residents of the village of Yasuf clashed with Israeli soldiers investigating the attack .
Eyewitnesses say settlers were responsible .
Attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers are increasing .
A number of incidents have been captured on video .
One of the slogans sprayed on the wall of the mosque in Yasuf read : " Get ready to pay the price , " Israeli public radio reported .
Another read : " We will burn you all . "
Some hard - line settlers advocate a " price tag " policy under which they attack Palestinians in retaliation for any Israeli government measure they see as threatening Jewish settlements .
The village is located near the Jewish settlement of Tappuah .
In a statement , the Israeli military said it " views the incident gravely " and that security forces were working to locate the perpetrators .
But the local Palestinian governor , Munir Abushi , accused the Israeli security forces of doing too little to protect Palestinians from settler attacks .
A settler organisation in the area denied that settlers were behind the attack .
Meanwhile one rabbi from the south of the West Bank , Mechachem Froman , has offered to help renovate the mosque , saying attacks against holy buildings were against Jewish law .
Israeli human rights groups have accused the police and army of running inadequate investigations into attacks by settlers on Palestinians .
One group reported that nine out of 10 investigations into alleged attacks on Palestinians by settlers ended without anyone being charged .
Settlement curb call
On Wednesday , thousands of Jewish settlers and their supporters staged a rally in Jerusalem in protest at a recently announced curb on settlement building in the West Bank .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered a 10 - month lull in permits for new settlement homes in the West Bank , not including East Jerusalem .
The order followed US and Palestinian calls for a total freeze in settlement building .
Palestinian officials have refused to rejoin peace talks until a total freeze is imposed .
All Jewish settlements in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , are illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this .

My only disagreement with this e-mail from an EA source is the assertion , " Nothing left to say . "
As we see the unfolding outcomes of the marches of last week , the writer has a lot of importance to say :
I know that you are completely informed of all the news about 13th Aban demonstrations and there is nothing left to say but these are the important things that I have noticed .
First , the brilliant presence of women not only as the demonstrators , but as a safeguard to keep the men protected , they stood in front of the groups of demonstrators to impede the government forces to beat the men and this was the reason that this time the detainees are mostly women .
Second , the government forces enjoyed using a new tactic this time in which they hid themselves among the demonstrators , and from there they tried to beat people , in order to show that these are protesters who were fighting amongst themselves .
Third , the behaviour of the government forces were like 18th of Tir [ 9 July of this year ] and 30th of Khordad [ 20 June ] , extreme brutality , with the only difference that at least they did not kill anyone .
The protesters were surprised for they thought that everything would be like [ the relatively peaceful occasion on ] Qods Day .
Fourth , although lots of people were injured ( even one of my colleagues ) , they are not without hope .
It seems that protest has become an inevitable and inseparable part of people 's lives .
They live , they work , they laugh , and they do all the routine things of life , but at the bottom of it they wait for an opportunity to protest .
Fifth , those who participate in these protests are very mature .
As long as the government did not suppress them brutally , they are silent and just say the mottoes which represent peace and calmness .
At the moment that the security forces begin to crack down with all their force and instruments , then the mottoes and actions of protesters become extreme too , because they have no other choice to save their lives .
Sixth , the general belief of the protesters is that this movement is like a marathon , so those who are participating in it should have strong will , perseverance , patience , and tirelessness .
They can not be hopeless and they should be happy patient till the result comes true .
Al - Qaeda operative Luai Sakra apparently goes into hiding in the region of Stuttgart , Germany , after 9/11 .
He reportedly gave details of the 9/11 attacks to the Syrian government shortly before 9/11 ( see September 10 , 2001 ) .
The Syrians then passed this on to the CIA shortly after 9/11 .
According to Der Spiegel , while Sakra ’s name was not made public , “ For the Mossad and the CIA he [ soon ] became one of the most wanted men in the world . ” [ Der Spiegel ( Hamburg ) , 8/15/2005 ]
In late 2005 , after Sakra ’s arrest in Turkey ( see July 30 , 2005 ) , the German television news show Panorama will report that the German BKA ( Federal Office of Criminal Investigation ) suspects the German BND ( Federal Intelligence Service ) to have helped Sakra escape from Germany in late 2001 .
Supposedly , German police had learned where he was staying in Germany , but the BND enabled him to escape via France to Syria in order to prevent further investigations about him .
Panorama will report that Sakra was secretly still working for Syrian intelligence and was giving them information about al - Qaeda ’s leadership .
Sakra will go on to mastermind a series of suicide bombings in Istanbul , Turkey , in 2003 ( see November 15 - 20 , 2003 ) before being arrested in 2005 ( see July 30 , 2005 ) . [ Agence France - Presse ,
10/27/2005 ]
The Bundestag [ lower chamber of the German parliament ]
Parliamentary Control Body will meet in November 2005 to discuss the allegations , but the session is held in secret and what is said exactly will not be not publicly revealed .
[ BBC , 11/9/2005 ]
The Bundestag will later issue a short statement clearing the BND of any wrongdoing in the case .
[ Deutscher Bundestag ,
11/30/2005 ]
But in 2007 , a book by former CIA Director George Tenet will indicate that not only did Sakra have some foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks , but he was an informant for the CIA and Syrian intelligence before 9/11 as well ( see September 10 , 2001 ) .
Other evidence suggests Sakra was also an informant for Turkish intelligence before 9/11 ( see Early August 2001 ) .
If he was an informant for any of these countries , it would explain why the BND might have wanted to protect him from arrest and investigation .
German intelligence officials are able to interview Mohammed Haydar Zammar , a member of the al - Qaeda cell in Hamburg with some of the 9/11 hijackers , while he is being secretly held in a Syrian prison .
Zammar was born and raised in Syria but later became a German citizen .
He was arrested in Morocco in late 2001 and sent by the US to Syria for torture and interrogation ( see October 27 - November 2001 and December 2001 ) .
Secret Deal between Syria and Germany -
In July 2002 , German officials met with Syrian officials at the German Federal Chancellery in Berlin .
The Syrians were led by Assef Shawkat , a trusted associate and relative of Syrian President Bashar Assad .
The Germans included the heads of the Federal Intelligence Service ( BND ) and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation ( BKA ) .
The Syrians wanted the Germans to call off a German legal case that had charged two Syrians , one of them an employee at the Syrian embassy , with espionage .
The Syrians also wanted Germany to call off an investigation into President Assad ’s uncle , Faisal Sammak , for storing explosives at a diplomatic residence , which resulted in a 1983 bombing in Berlin that killed one person .
The Germans in return wanted the Syrians to disband their network of spies in Germany , and they wanted access to Zammar .
The Germans and Syrians struck a deal based on these demands .
Shortly thereafter , German prosecutors dropped the charges against the two Syrians accused of espionage .
In return , German officials are allowed to meet with Zammar as long as the meeting and all information from it remain secret .
Meeting with Zammar - On November 20 , 2002 , six German intelligence officials , including those from the BND and BKA , plus those from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( BfV ) , go to Damascus , Syria , to see Zammar .
The prison is notorious for frequently using torture , and the German officials cannot miss that Zammar has been ill - treated and tortured .
In fact , Zammar used to weigh about 300 pounds , and he has lost around 100 pounds .
Zammar speaks with surprising candor , perhaps feeling confident that the Germans will never be able to use his confession in any criminal case because he has been so clearly tortured by the Syrians .
Zammar admits that he attended a militant training camp in Afghanistan in 1991 .
He attended another Afghan camp in 1994 , where he learned how to use poison and various weapons .
In the summer of 1995 , he fought with the Bosnian Muslims against the Serbs .
In September 2000 , he says he brought money to Afghanistan for al - Qaeda and even had a face - to - face meeting with Osama bin Laden ( see September - October 2000 ) .
Zammar 's Link to the 9/11 Plotters - Zammar claims that he met 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta at the Al - Quds mosque in Hamburg in 1996 , and met hijacker associate Ramzi bin al - Shibh soon thereafter .
He met hijacker Marwan Alshehhi in 1998 , and had more contact with him .
Zammar claims he helped Atta , bin al - Shibh , Alshehhi , and hijacker Ziad Jarrah get to Afghanistan in late 1999 .
However , when they returned , he only heard a general account of their training and he was not told anything about the 9/11 plot .
Zammar had a sense that something big was happening , because in early September 2001 , many of the members of the Hamburg cell left Germany for Afghanistan around the same time .
For instance , when cell member Said Bahaji left Germany ( see September 3 - 5 , 2001 ) , Zammar and some other friends ( including Mounir El Motassadeq and Abdelghani Mzoudi ) accompanied him to the airport to say goodbye .
The German officials realize that Zammar may not be as honest about his knowledge of the 9/11 plot as he is with other details , but they are fairly certain from their intelligence investigation that he supported the hijackers in a general way without having detailed foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks .
[ Der Spiegel ( Hamburg ) , 11/21/2005 ]
However , in 2003 it will emerge that another al - Qaeda operative told investigators that Zammar told him in August 2001 to leave Germany very soon because something big was about to happen ( see August 2001 ) .
So Zammar may not have been honest on his knowledge of the 9/11 plot .
[ Los Angeles Times , 1/30/2003 ]
Intelligence Cannot Be Used -
The German officials show Zammar a series of photographs of suspected German militants and ask him to identify them .
He does identify and discuss some of them , including German businessman Mamoun Darkazanli .
Discussions with Zammar continue for three days .
However , none of his confession will subsequently be used in any court cases .
Der Spiegel will later comment , “ The six officials [ who questioned Zammar ] and their agencies know full well that no court operating under the rule of law would ever accept an interrogation conducted in a Damascus prison notorious for its torture practices . ”
Secret Deal Falls Apart - German officials plan to return to Syria and question Zammar some more .
However , this never happens because the Syrians renege on their part of the deal , after they fail to cut back on their spying efforts in Germany .
One anonymous German official will later say , “ The [ deal ] was an attempt , but we now know that it was a mistake . ”

Abstract
The standard narrative of the meltdown of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers assumes that the wealth of the top executives of these firms was largely wiped out along with their firms .
In the ongoing debate about regulatory responses to the financial crisis , commentators have used this assumed fact as a basis for dismissing both the role of compensation structures in inducing risk - taking and the potential value of reforming such structures .
This paper provides a case study of compensation at Bear Stearns and Lehman during 2000 - 2008 and concludes that this assumed fact is incorrect .
We find that the top - five executive teams of these firms cashed out large amounts of performance - based compensation during the 2000 - 2008 period .
During this period , they were able to cash out large amounts of bonus compensation that was not clawed back when the firms collapsed , as well as to pocket large amounts from selling shares .
Overall , we estimate that the top executive teams of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers derived cash flows of about $ 1.4 billion and $ 1 billion respectively from cash bonuses and equity sales during 2000 - 2008 .
These cash flows substantially exceeded the value of the executives ’ initial holdings in the beginning of the period , and the executives ’ net payoffs for the period were thus decidedly positive .
The divergence between how the top executives and their shareholders fared implies that it is not possible to rule out , as standard narratives suggest , that the executives ’ pay arrangements provided them with excessive risk - taking incentives .
We discuss the implications of our analysis for understanding the possible role that pay arrangements have played in the run-up to the financial crisis and how they should be reformed going forward .

Obama loves his rhetoric , and his speech on the Afghan surge was topped by a rhetorical flourish :
“ Our cause is just , our resolve unshaken ” .
He is of course wrong on both counts .
The occupation of Afghanistan by the US and its allies is there to prop up the government of President Karzai .
Karzai’s has always been an ultra-corrupt government of vicious warlords and drugs barons .
I have been pointing this out for years ,
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-469983/Britain-protecting-biggest-heroin-crop-time.html#ixzz0VS78HVR1
The CIA is up to its usual tricks again supporting the drug running of key warlords loyal to them .
They are also setting up death squads on the Central American model , in cooperation with Blackwater .
Fortunately Karzai ’s rigging of his re-election was so blatant that the scales have fallen from the eys of the public and even the mainstream media .
Politicians no longer pretend we are promoting democracy in Afghanistan .
Karzai comes directly from the Bush camp and was put in place because of his role with Unocal in developing the Trans Afghanistan Gas Pipeline project .
That remains a chief strategic goal .
The Asian Development Bank has agreed finance to start construction in Spring 2011 .
It is of course a total coincidence that 30,000 extra US troops will arrive six months before , and that the US ( as opposed to other NATO forces ) deployment area corresponds with the pipeline route .
Obama ’s claim that “ Our cause is just ” ultimately rests on the extraordinary claim that , eight years after the invasion , we are still there in self - defence .
In both the UK and US , governments are relying on the mantra that the occupation of Afghanistan protects us from terrorism at home .
This is utter nonsense .
The large majority of post 9/11 terror incidents have been by Western Muslims outraged by our invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Put bluntly , if we keep invading Muslim countries , of course we will face a violent backlash .
The idea that because we occupy Afghanistan a Muslim from Dewsbury or Detroit disenchanted with the West would not be able to manufacture a bomb is patent nonsense .
It would be an infinitely better strategy to make out theoretical Muslim less disenchanted by not attacking and killing huge numbers of his civilian co-religionists .
Our cause is unjust .
We are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and for the further of radicalisation of Muslim communities worldwide .
That threatens a perpetual war – which is of course just what the military - industrial complex and the security industry want .
They have captured Obama .
Fortunately , our resolve is shaken .
The ordinary people of the UK and US have begun in sufficient numbers to see through this perpetual war confidence trick ; they realise there is nothing in it for them but dead youngsters and high taxes .
That is why Obama made a very vague promise – which I believe in its vagueness and caveats to be deliberate deceit – that troops will start to leave in 2011 .
Today ’s promises of 5,000 additional NATO troops are , incidentally , empty rhetoric .
I gather from friends in the FCO that firm pledges to date amount to 670 .
A well - placed source close to the Taliban in Pakistan tells me that the Afghan Taliban and their tribal allies have a plan .
As the US seeks massively to expand the Afghan forces , they are feeding in large numbers of volunteers .
I suspect that while we may see the odd attack on their trainers , the vast majority will get trained , fed , paid and equipped and bide their time before turning en masse .
This is nothing new ; it is precisely the history of foreign occupations in the region and the purchase of tribal auxiliaries and alliances .
Confidence Melting Away Can Climate Forecasts Still Be Trusted ?
First , it was a series of e-mails that led many to begin doubting the veracity of climate scientists .
Then , the United Nations climate body itself had to reverse dire predictions about the melting of glaciers in the Himalayan Mountains .
Other claims have raised doubts as well .

The ocean is a potentially vast source of electric power , yet as engineers test new technologies for capturing it , the devices are plagued by battering storms , limited efficiency , and the need to be tethered to the seafloor .
Now , a team of aerospace engineers is applying the principles that keep airplanes aloft to create a new wave - energy system that is durable , extremely efficient , and can be placed anywhere in the ocean , regardless of depth .
While still in early design stages , computer and scale - model tests of the system suggest higher efficiencies than wind turbines .
The system is designed to effectively cancel incoming waves , capturing their energy while flattening them out , providing an added application as a storm - wave breaker .
The researchers , from the U.S. Air Force Academy , will present their design at the 62nd annual meeting of the American Physical Society 's Division of Fluid Dynamics on Nov. 24 , 2009 , in Minneapolis , Minn .
" Our group was working on very basic research on feedback flow control for years , " says lead researcher Stefan Siegel , referring to efforts to use sensors and adjustable parts to control how fluids flow around airfoils like wings .
" For an airplane , when you control that flow , you better control flight -- for example , enabling you to land a plane on a shorter runway . "
A colleague had read an article on wave energy in a magazine and mentioned it to Siegel and the other team members , and they realized they could operate a wave energy device using the same feedback control concepts they had been developing .
advertisement
Supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation , the researchers developed a system that uses lift instead of drag to cause the propeller blades to move .
" Every airplane flies with lift , not with drag , " says Siegel .
" Compare an old style windmill with a modern one .
The new style uses lift and is what made wind energy viable -- and it does n't get shredded in a storm like an old windmill .
Fluid dynamics fixed the issue for windmills , and can do the same for wave energy . "
Windmills have active controls that turn the blades to compensate for storm winds , eliminating lift when it is a risk , and preventing damage .
The Air Force Academy researchers used the same approach with a hydrofoil ( equivalent to an airfoil , but for water ) and built it into a cycloidal propeller , a design that emerged in the 1930s and currently propels tugboats , ferries and other highly maneuverable ships .
The researchers changed the propeller orientation from horizontal to vertical , allowing direct interaction with the cyclic , up and down motion of wave energy .
The researchers also developed individual control systems for each propeller blade , allowing sophisticated manipulations that maximize ( or minimize , in the case of storms ) interaction with wave energy .
advertisement
Ultimately , the goal is to keep the flow direction and blade direction constant , cancelling the incoming wave and using standard gear - driven or direct - drive generators to convert the wave energy into electric energy .
A propeller that is exactly out of phase with a wave will cancel that wave and maximize energy output .
The cancellation will also allow the float - mounted devices to function without the need of mooring , important for deep - sea locations that hold tremendous wave energy potential and are currently out of reach for many existing wave energy designs .
While the final device may be as large as 40 meters across , laboratory models are currently less than a meter in diameter .
A larger version of the system will be tested next year at NSF 's Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ( NEES ) tsunami wave basin at Oregon State University , an important experiment for proving the efficacy of the design .
The conference takes place from Nov. 22 - 24 , 2009 , at the Minneapolis Convention Center .
The conference is the year 's largest devoted to fluid dynamics , bringing together researchers from across the world and across a wide range of disciplines .
The talk , " Deep Ocean Wave Cancellation Using a Cycloidal Turbine " is by Stefan Siegel , Tiger Jeans , and Thomas McLaughlin of the U.S. Air Force Academy .

While the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington D.C has reneged on its promise to halt its social services programs in the city after the City Council passed gay marriage legislation , three churches in Michigan just can’t handle even a neutral stance on homosexuality , and are thus pulling out of a homeless services consortium .
Kalamazoo ’s Martha ’s
Table , which counts eight churches among its prayer - and - food program , is hosted by the Protestant / United Church of Christ parish at First Congregational Church .
And because First Congregational Church dared support LGBT tolerance — by backing Kalamazoo ’s transgender protection ordinance — Martha ’s Table is seeing three churches make a swift exit , because they do n’t want to be part of anything that another LGBT - tolerant church is involved with .
Agape Christian Church and Word for Life Church of God plan to withdraw from Martha ’s Table at the end of the year , and Centerpoint Church ( formerly Third Reformed Church ) has already done so , [ First Congregational pastor Rev. Matt Laney , pictured ] said .
“ The founding principle of Martha ’s Table was that churches would come together and put aside their differences in light of what unites us , which is our common commitment to serve Christ and others , ” Laney said .
“ But now this difference has risen above our common commitment to serving Christ . ”
Laney said representatives of all three churches have been “ very clear ” that they do n’t want to be “ guilty by association ” with First Congregational and its inclusiveness of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people , said Laney , who publicly supported an ordinance passed by Kalamazoo voters in November that protects GLBT people from discrimination in housing , jobs and accommodations .
“ To me , it ’s incredibly disappointing , ” Laney said .
“ That ’s the best word I can give it .
It ’s also mystifying .
I was very shocked and surprised when they pulled out . ”
It ’s unclear whether the three churches leaving Martha ’s Table will join another homeless services group , or will contribute to starving Kalamazoo ’s most needy .

Israel announced plans last week to use the Web to improve its image abroad in two ways : by setting up a new unit of the Israel Defense Forces devoted to fighting criticism on YouTube , Facebook and Twitter , and through what the Israeli newspaper Haaretz described as “ an initiative by the Information and Diaspora Ministry to train people to represent Israel independently on the Internet . ”
While it is not yet clear exactly what form this government - sponsored offensive against Israel ’s online opponents will take , in some ways YouTube is already a key front in the battle for international public opinion about what is happening in the contested West Bank .
And the skirmishing there seems to be happening among private individuals , acting without any apparent state support .
To take one example , last week amateur video of an Israeli settler driving his car over a prone Palestinian man — who had just been shot at a West Bank gas station after reportedly stabbing the settler ’s wife — was uploaded to the video - sharing site soon after it was broadcast on Israeli television .
The next day that graphic , disturbing footage , filmed at the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba , started to get more attention on the Web after it was featured in this English - language report from Al Jazeera that was posted on the broadcaster ’s YouTube channel :
It seems significant that this video appeared first on Israeli state television , the same week an editorial was published in Haaretz headlined , “ Israel Must Crack Down on Settler Lawlessness . ”
Watching events there from a distance , it is easy to forget that the settlements on the West Bank are not just a cause of tension between Israelis and Palestinians , but also within Israeli society .
Since the video starts after the stabbing attack on two settlers the Palestinian man was accused of , it is not surprising that supporters of the Israeli settlement project were unhappy to see it spread around the world via YouTube .
One day after that footage first appeared online , The Jerusalem Post reported that another graphic clip depicting an act of violence had been uploaded to YouTube .
According to the Israeli newspaper , this video showed “ a Palestinian female terrorist stabbing a civilian security guard at a West Bank checkpoint . ”
As The Post pointed out , this clip , uploaded in December , was not new :
In the video , filmed on October 25 , the Palestinian , who allegedly asked to enter Israel via the Kalandiya checkpoint for medical treatment , is seen being examined by a Border Police officer .
The officer finds a knife in her purse , and while he takes the purse aside , the woman pulls another blade from her trousers and stabs the civilian security guard standing by .
The security guard , working for a private firm , was still recuperating from his moderate wounds on Wednesday .
The video seems to not be direct footage , but footage of a closed - circuit TV surveillance camera ’s output .
The date “ 10/25/2009 ″ appears faintly at the bottom of the screen early in the clip .
The Israeli newspaper reported that “ An investigation was launched to find the source that leaked the video to YouTube . ”
That language is not quite accurate , though , since the video - sharing site is not a news organization but a platform that lets anyone upload video to the site directly .
Someone simply decided to upload this video to YouTube in the immediate aftermath of the small storm of controversy caused by the other video showing an attack on the West Bank .
It is impossible to say if the video of the Palestinian attack was uploaded in response to the video of the Israeli attack .
It may have been a sort of reply to the first video , or the timing may have been entirely coincidental .
What is certain is that , just as supporters of the Palestinian cause drew attention to the clip of the Israeli attack , supporters of the Israeli settlers shared and discussed and reposted the clip of the Palestinian attack .
The Israeli blogger and radio host Tamar Yonah embedded the video in a post headlined “ Arab Woman Stabs Jew — Caught on video ! ” Ms. Yonah introduced the video this way :
The City of Perth is supporting a police crackdown on alcohol consumption at the Perth foreshore on Australia Day .
Police will be seizing alcohol with offenders facing the possibility of a $ 200 fine .
In the past , police have targeted drunks and troublemakers but are warning this year there will be no exceptions .
The City 's CEO , Frank Edwards , says he does not expect the crackdown to reduce the numbers of people who will turn up .
" I believe it will encourage families to come out and if it keeps away a few people whose only interest is alcohol , then so be it , " he said .
The Police Commander for the Skyworks show this year , Michelle Fyffe , says police will be enforcing the law .
" It is illegal to drink alcohol in public 365 days a year , it does n't say except for Australia Day , so it 's illegal to do it and we will be policing it and enforcing the law , " she said .
Acting Assistant Commissioner
Fyffe says even people having a ' quiet drink ' wo n't be exempt .
" This is a very large event and we certainly have our priorities and we are going to target troublemakers first but my officers will be patrolling the whole area and they have been instructed to specifically look at this issue , " she said .
" Street drinking is illegal and they will take action . "
The common attributes abound and history 's menagerie of corporate hybrids - commercial religions , ecclesiastical governments , academic businesses , governmental trading bodies , etc. - prove that the monsters are mutually fertile .
All that is wanting then is a " common name " , something like " dog " that transcends the apparent discrepencies between chihuahuas , bulldogs and great danes to indicate that we are in fact dealing with a single bundle of creation .
This is a serious lack for without a clear category for their common existence it is difficult to think of , speak of or visualize them .
Present candidate terms are rather clumsy or obscure - megasome , corpocyte , kyoseitai [ short for Jp : kyodo seimeitai - " cooperative life body " ] .
For now we shall limp along with traditional organismic vocabulary ( while praying for some gifted reader to invent or offer the fit and final Word ) .
Japan was hardly the first to recognize organismic realities .
The biological metaphorics for integrated collective bodies are ancient on both sides of the planet .
Politics and medicine were sister disciplines in pre-Han China and the rulers ' husbandry of the societal organism was dictated by the same common sense that informed the disciplines of human health and healing .
The Hindu Brahmins of the period were also describing their community 's castes in terms of the limbs and organs of a physical body ( and predictably selecting themselves for the preeminent and metabolically privileged role of the brain ) .
And further to the West , St. Paul was conjuring a new sacerdotal monad , the " mystical body of Christ " , that would soon incorporate all of Europe .
' They [ the emerging corporations ] have all commodities under their control and practice without concealment all manner of trickery ; they raise and lower prices as they please and oppress and ruin all the small tradesmen , as the pike devour the little fish of the water just as though they were lord 's over God 's creatures and free from all the laws of faith and love . '
Martin Luther , " On Trading and Usury " , 1524 Though Western biological similes were often no more than heuristic conceits ( Hobbes ' Leviathon , Frank Norris ' Octopus , Franz Neumann 's Behemoth , etc. ) there was obvious foreboding of the organic nature of societal life forms and their increasing power over humans both inside and outside their membranes .
It was not until the turn of this century , however , that ethology , biology and social psychology achieved enough sophistication to pursue the analogy seriously .
Between 1890 and the 1920's organismic thinking picked up enormous momentum .
Researchers in France , Germany and England established the concept of insect societies as " supraorganisms " and began to draw telling parallels between hives , nests and termitaries and highly integrated human organizations .
Scores of studies were published on colonial organisms , cooperative life forms and other collective biological realities .
The western classics on group consciousness also appeared from this ferment .
Schaeffle 's The Life & Limbs of the Social Body , Le Bon 's The Crowd , and MacDougal 's The Group Mind all clearly demonstrated that something psychologically new and evolutionarily significant emerged in human collectives , something far greater than the sum of the parts .
At the end of the ' 20's , however , two obstacles - one political , the other conceptual - arose to derail the entire international inquiry .
The political problem was fascism .
Organismic thinking seemed to play right into the bloody hands of fascist ideologues .
If indeed great social bodies were more powerful than men - outproducing them , outliving them , and supporting vast numbers of them - then they also were plausibly more important .
( As an Osaka executive who destroyed evidence and himself to thwart an investigation of his firm wrote before dying : " Please accept this humble offering .
I am but one .
The kaisha [ corporation ] is many .
My life is transient .
The kaisha is forever ! " )
The social organism was thus an evolutionary advance upon mankind much as the multicellular animal was an advance upon protozoa .
And as a " greater whole " its commonweal " naturally " took precedence over its individual members ' .
From a corporatist standpoint then , anyone threatening the unity , efficiency or " health " of the collective body could and should be sacrificed with the same insouciance with which we excise a cancer or a gangrenous toe .
Eliminating dissidents , in other words , was not a question of morality but of rational social medicine .
For Western liberals who tacitly tolerated executions for treason and desertion in their own societies this thinking ( and the organismic research that lent it credence ) presented an ethically thorny and unwanted problem , especially at a time when the Nazi organism was threatening to engulf all of Europe .
The conceptual problem was rather more straightforward : the absence of an equivalent of protoplasm to explain what really connects and integrates a social body 's members .
Language may allow individuals to interact but many mutually hostile organisms can arise in the same linguistic sea .
What binds them internally ?
Group consciousness is fine in theory but what does it really consist of ?
If nothing can be physically pointed out or quantified , organismic research is mere poetry , unscientific and a waste of time .
Neither of these difficulties phased the Japanese , however .
Fascism as they understood it was a dandy idea .
Did n't it come from the Roman fasces ( a bundle of rods with a protruding axe - head ) that symbolized social unity ( bundle ) under state authority ( axe ) ?
Did n't it virtually deify a strong central leader , extoll self - sacrifice and collective effort , and promote belongingness with uniforms , symbols and ceremonies ?
What else had Japan been working to realize since the Meiji Restoration ?
Organismic theory of course abetted these efforts and would play an important role in ultranationalist debates on the nature and primacy of the kokutai [ the mystical body of the Japanese state ] .
As for the reality and substance of social bonds the Japanese had the enormous advantage of the ki concept which we discussed at length in the last issue [ " Ki and the Arts of Sex , Healing and Corporate Body Building " , Kyoto Journal # 5 ] .
Translated ( too ) simply , ki means psycho-biological vital force .
Ki in the social sphere was seen as the living force of attention or directed consciousness , a force that carried energy from the perceiver to the perceived and tied them together , much as energy exchange bonds atoms and molecules .
Social ki , while invisible , is as palpable as the wind to many Japanese and they have scores of expressions to describe its effects upon the minds & bodies of those sending and receiving it .
Ki or attention 's patterned circulation within a group bonds and integrates the members and determines their collective " structure " .
The strength and cohesion of any social body is therefore to be measured by how much of the members ' ki or attention is devoted solely to the collective and its shared concerns .
Attention to strictly personal matters , outside interests , other groups , etc. constitutes a weakening " leakage " of the collective 's adhesive energies and esprit de corps .
Japanese corporate bodies therefore employ dozens of tactics [ company unions , company housing , group vacations , company sports teams , company drinking groups , cemetaries , etc. ] to keep members ' ki circulating totally within its membranes :
The kaisha [ corporation ] is the community to which one belongs primarily , and which is all - important in one 's life .
Thus in most cases the company provides the whole social existence of a person , and has authority over all aspects of his life ... [ Its ] power and influence not only affect and enter into the individual 's actions , it alters even his ideas and ways of thinking ... Some perceive this as a dangerous encroachment upon their dignity as individuals ; others , however , feel safer in total group consciousness .
There seems little doubt that in Japan the latter group is in the majority .
Japan does thus seem to know what she 's doing and the superior strength and vitality of her organisms ( & the peculiar devotion of their members ) may be looked at from the overlapping perspectives of genetics , socialization & attention management .
Population Pruning & Right Wing Genes
Like most other traits and preferences in a natural population the taste for organizational life is randomly distributed .
Some people love hierarchical group existence - the uniforms & rituals , the secure routines , the superior / inferior relation - ships , the sense of merging oneself in a larger whole and greater destiny .
Others detest it , with the majority falling along the normal distribution curve somewhere in between .
Before the rise of vast socialist / communist bodies the right / left political distinction originally reflected this love / hate spectrum .
In early Japan as elsewhere the primitive leftists were fractious , independant types who abhored hierarchy , establishments " , authoritarianism and just wanted to be left alone .
The rightists were most often joiner types who flocked to regimented security of the military , clergy and other bureaucratic power centers .
Since even in those days the big bodies scoffed the lion 's share of everything , they occasionally rankled the " little people " to rebellion .
But because the anti-authoritarian lefties then as now took orders ungraciously , organized poorly , and were usually decimated in these confrontations , their gene pool slowly began to bleed away .
Japan 's most ingenious contribution to corporate eugenics , however , was devised during the Edo period .
The samurai 's kirisute gomen [ literally , " honorable permit to slash & trash " ] , was an open - ended license to kill any commoner deemed " dangerous , disrespectful or offensive " with the same impunity that a breeder culls his flocks of undesired traits .
This terrifying and oft exercised prerogative genetically pruned over 15 generations of the population of its most assertive and egalitarian DNA .
Since artificial selection studies on plants and animals repeatedly show that such procedures can create or destroy stable heritable traits in as few as five generations , the contributions of samurai cutlery to contemporary Japanese " groupiness " should not be underestimated .
Anthroculture : Rearing Corporate - Friendly Humans
From a social engineering point of view , whether or not you have a genetically predisposed population , there are a variety of proven methods to enhance a people 's reliance on authoritarian groups and curb their sense of or desire for personal autonomy .
Japanese culture presents a curiously comprehensive catalog of such techniques .
Washington ( CNN ) --
A temporary protected status for Haitian nationals who were in the United States as of Tuesday has been designated by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , she announced Friday .
" This is a disaster of historic proportions and this designation will allow eligible Haitian nationals in the United States to continue living and working in our country for the next 18 months , " she said .
" Providing a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti is part of this administration 's continuing efforts to support Haiti's recovery . "
Napolitano estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Haitian nationals are in the United States illegally .
She told reporters the temporary status allows them to stay for 18 months , authorizing them to work and send remittances back to Haiti as the nation " gets back on its feet . "
However , she said , Haitians who now attempt to travel to the United States will not be eligible for the temporary status and will be repatriated to Haiti .
She added that there have been no signs so far of an increase of Haitian nationals trying to enter the United States after Tuesday 's earthquake .

Michael Arrington 's TechCrunch on Thursday filed suit against Fusion Garage for what it considers to be " wrongful conduct " regarding the upcoming JooJoo tablet .
Michael Arrington 's TechCrunch on Thursday filed suit against Fusion Garage for what it considers to be " wrongful conduct " regarding the upcoming JooJoo tablet .
Fusion Garage earlier this week .
It was initially conceived as the CrunchPad , with backing from Arrington and TechCrunch , but Arrington says that Fusion Garage cut him out of the deal at the last minute .
Fusion Garage says that Arrington did not deliver on his promises , so they proceeded without him .
" Tech Crunch conceived , initiated , developed , directed , and promoted the CrunchPad project , " according to the suit , which was filed in California district court .
" Moreover , TechCrunch supported the CrunchPad project with expertise , talent , oversight , energy , cash , and concrete contributions to the hardware and software development . "
TechCrunch contributed the design and oversight , the first two prototypes , payment to vendors , advice on solving technical problems , hosting Fusion Garage personnel , and lining up promotion , marketing , and distribution channels , the suit said .
Fusion Garage is accused of false advertising , breach of fiduciary duty , misappropriation of business deals , fraud and deceit , and unlawful business practices .
TechCrunch wants the court to stop Fusion Garage from selling the JooJoo and to award it damages .
The CrunchPad idea dates back to July 2008 , when Arrington wrote a blog post in which he asked readers to help him build a " dead simple Web tablet for $ 200 . "
In a Monday webcast , Fusion Garage chief executive Chandra Rathakrishnan said he approached Arrington at his TechCrunch 50 conference that year and later met with him to show off the company 's tablet prototype .
TechCrunch 's suit says it developed its own CrunchPad prototype by August 30 , but did not meet Rathakrishnan until the conference in September .
Arrington points to a now - deleted blog post in which Rathakrishnan wrote that he was working with CrunchPad lead Louis Monier " in getting the software in shape for the hardware prototype B . "
At that meeting , Fusion Garage showed off " nothing more than an off - the - shelf browser and some HTML , " not a finished product , the suit says .
TechCrunch claims that the blog was deleted " to conceal from the public the true facts about the collaboration between TechCrunch " and Fusion Garage .
Arrington says that he worked with Fusion Garage over the next several months on a few CrunchPad prototypes .
In June 2009 , Rathakrishnan asked TechCrunch to make a payment to vendors , which TechCrunch did , the suit says .
Later that month , TechCrunch drafted a deal under which TechCrunch would acquire Fusion Garage in exchange for 35 percent of the merged company 's stock .
Arrington , however , did not believe the deal was solid and wrote to Rathakrishnan that " it looks like our position is to turn the project off completely . "
Rathakrishnan wrote back to say that he wanted to proceed on TechCrunch 's terms , though no contracts were signed .
Fusion Garage then " missed key milestones in the development process , " prompting TechCrunch to again threaten closing up shop on the CrunchPad .
Rathakrishnan asked that TechCrunch not do that and flew himself and some of his staff to California to work on the project in advance of the Nov. 20 " Crunch Up " meeting .
In November , Rathakrishnan e-mailed Arrington to say that the deal was off and that Fusion Garage was proceeding without TechCrunch .
TechCrunch accuses Fusion Garage of having financial troubles and lying throughout the development process .
In a Friday blog post , Arrington wrote that " Fusion Garage 's financial situation is a mess " and that they will not have enough money to defend themselves until after the company takes in cash from Friday pre-sales .
" We believe it is irresponsible for press to link to the pre-sale site without disclosing this to readers , " Arrington concluded .
Fusion Garage did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
You could Tweet all the highlights of 2009 and still have time for dithering .
But to catalog the lingo ?
It would be like one long torture memo .
We need to impose a timetable .
Let ’s get right to our full plate .
It was a year for birthers , deathers and Tenthers to go all nine - iron on the Obama brand .
Catchphrases and buzzwords can tell us much about a year past — what resonated , what stuck , what the year revealed about the sensibility of the nation , whether you ’re a wise Latina woman , a mini-Madoff , a teabagger or Balloon Boy .
But if ever there were a year to put buzzwords before a death panel , this would be it , before the aporkalypse comes .
If the year were a Government Motors car , it would be a clunker .
There was so much distraction .
Things like Great Recessions and mancessions will do that , distract you ( like a Dracula sneeze ) .
So will texting while driving , which is far more dangerous in the scheme of things than sexting ( unless it ’s sexting while driving ) , and maybe even hiking the Appalachian Trail .
Whatever , it was a year when a lot of people acted stupidly .
Here is a sign that things are artificially stimulated : Abnormally high Existing Home Sales for November 2009 , pushing ginormous annual gains :
“ Existing - home sales – including single - family , townhomes , condominiums and co-ops – rose 7.4 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units in November from 6.09 million in October , and are 44.1 % higher than the 4.54 million - unit pace in November 2008 .
Current sales remain at the highest level since February 2007 when they hit 6.55 million . ”
Now granted , we are comparing the heart of the credit crisis , a very weak seasonal period one year ago , with the present sub - 5 % mortgages and the ( expected end of ) a government home buying credit .
Sales are up as prices continue to fall .
Lower priced homes — especially Condo and Coop sales — were up a whopping 60 % over last year .
While seasonal adjustments might have impacted the monthly data , the year over year numbers are simply off the charts .
Other data points :
- The national median existing - home price was $ 172,600 in November 2009 , 4.3 % below November 2008 .
- Single - family home sales jumped 8.5 % ( SA annual rate ) 5.77 million in November ; Up 42.1 % above November 2008 .
- The median existing single - family home price was $ 171,900 in November , down 4.4 % from a year ago .
- Distressed properties accounted for 33 % of sales in November ; - First - time buyers purchased 51 % of homes in November - Total housing inventory at the end of November declined 1.3 % to 3.52 million existing homes ( 6.5 - month supply ) ; - Unsold inventory is 15.5 % below year ago levels , and the lowest since April 2006 ; - Existing condominium and co-op sales in November were unchanged monthly , but gained 60.1 % from a year ago .
- Median existing condo price was $ 178,000 in November , down 3.1 % from year ago levels .
Bottom line : Improving sales numbers , falling home prices , reduced inventory , distressed sales still driving the narrative .
Bill over at Calculated Risk notes that going forward :
• Months - of - supply will now increase sharply as sales plunge .
Do not be fooled because months - of - supply is close to “ normal ” levels .
This is primarily because sales were distorted by the tax credit .
•
Excess inventory includes existing home inventory , rental units ( vacancy at record high ) , and various shadow inventory .
This is still near record levels .
•
House prices are now falling again – and this will show up in the Case - Shiller index soon .
•
This is probably the end of the “ good ” housing news for a while .

BREAKING NEWS !
( check for constantly updated and inserted info )
MONDAY AM 4TH UPDATE : 20th Century
Fox keeps refining its figures to show James Cameron ’s Avatar actuals were better than expected — Friday : $ 26,752,099 , Saturday : $ 25,529,036 , Sunday : $ 24,744,346 .
Grosses dropped only - 3 % from Saturday to Sunday and finished the weekend with an opening number of $ 77.025481 million ( not $ 77.3 M or $ 76.8 M or $ 73 M as the studio previously reported ) .
That placed second to 2D I Am Legend ‘s $ 77.2 M record for best December debut ever at the domestic box office .
Internationally , the epic surisingly shot up +3 % from Saturday to Sunday for $ 165.5M ( not $ 159.2 M ) in 106 countries .
That ’s a $ 242.5 M worldwide bow , including total 3D gross of $ 54,754,983 , which Fox calls the “ highest original content ( non-sequel , non- franchise ) opening weekend ever ” .
The big budget 3D technopic was the widest 3D release to date : 2,023 3D runs of 3,452 North American theaters .
At the 178 domestic IMAX theaters , a record breaking $ 9.5 M was made .
IMAX globally had to add shows to keep up with demand .
Overseas , 58 Imax venues grossed $ 4.1 M .
The worldwide IMAX total of $ 13.6 M bettered Transformers 2 ‘s previous record of $ 11.3 M this summer .
SUNDAY AM : 20th Century
Fox just said its big budget 3D technopic Avatar grossed $ 159.18 M internationally from 106 territories ( the six territories that have not opened are Japan , China , Italy , Poland , Argentina , and Uruguay ) .
With North America ’s snow - slowed grosses of $ 73 M , that ’s a worldwide total of $ 232.18 M which the studio says is the “ highest original content ( non-sequel , non- franchise ) opening weekend ever ” .
Even with depressed U.S. grosses because of massive snowstorms in New York , Philadelphia , and Washington DC , Avatar finished Saturday only - 5 % down from Friday .
That puts the technopic at $ 27 M Friday and $ 25.6 M for Saturday .
With $ 20 M estimated for Sunday , it ’s officially a $ 73 M pre-Xmas domestic opening weekend .
It ’s the best - ever debut for director James Cameron , best - ever opening for a 3D movie with IMAX shattering their records and selling out every seat and adding shows to keep up with demand .
It ’s also the 2nd best December debut of all time because of Avatar ‘s 3D ticket price premium compared to 2D films .
( No. 1 is still 2007 ’s I Am Legend at $ 77,211,321 , and No. 3 is now 2003 ’s The Lord Of The Rings : The Return Of The King at $ 72,629,713 . )
I ’m told that 59 % of 3D locations accounted for 71 % of total business .
The pic received a Cinemascore of “ A ” across every qudrant .
In terms of audience demos , exit polling showed 57 % male / 43 % female , and 38 % under age 25 /62 % over age 25 .
Avatar is playing in 3,542 total theaters in North America with 3D presentations at 2,038 sites accounting for almost 60 % of the grosses .
( Those 2,038 3D locations break down into 3,129 3D screens and 179 all 3D IMAX . )
“ Ca n’t wait for the East Coast snow to clear , ” one upbeat Fox exec tells me about studio hopes for the tentpole to have legs because of “ the tremendous word of mouth ” .
Overseas , it ’s playing in 17,222 screens ( including a total 3D / 3D Imax screens of 5,360 , and a total IMAX 3D screens of 81 ) .
Fox just announced Avatar made a whopping $ 159.18 internationally for a worldwide weekend total of $ 232.1 million — more than 2012 ‘s hefty $ 225 M 5 - day debut number because of Avatar ‘s higher 3D ticket prices .
Remember , this is the biggest 3D release in movie history , spurred by the excitement surrounding Cameron ’s creation of the Fusion Camera System technology for photo - realistic computer - generated characters through motion capture animation .
He wrote the script for Avatar back in the mid-1990s when he and Stan Winston co-founded Digital Domain .
But when he took the screenplay to their special effects lab , Cameron was told it was just not possible to make the film with the current technology .
So he sat on the project for more than a decade until there could be “ several thousand 3 - D screens ” capable of showing the film .
All of Saturday ’s pics were slammed by the snow .
Disney ’s holdover The Princess And The Frog placed No. 2 with a $ 12.2 M weekend , or - 49.5 % from a week ago .
Alcon Entertainment ’s and Warner Bros’ The Blind Side finished No. 3 with $ 10.3 M and closing in on $ 200 M cume by still showing incredible legs at the start of its 5th week in release .
Meanwhile , Sony Pictures is relieved that all the focus on Avatar this weekend meant it wo n’t attract much attention for the underperforming debut of Did You Hear About The Morgans ?
Starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant in what Rotten Tomatoes scored only 10 % positive reviews — i.e. it ’s unwatchable — the so - called comedy was lucky to open to $ 7 M this weekend ( not the $ 10 M even the studio hoped for ) .
It opened in 4th place Friday with just $ 2.5 M from 2,758 runs and +5 % for $ 2.6M Saturday .
“ Not what we wanted , but it will hang in throughout the holidays , ” a too - optimistic Sony exec told me .

SATURDAY PM : Studio sources tell me that 20th Century Fox ’s Avatar is +15 % from Friday when comparing matinees .
But today ’s total will likely be down from yesterday because of the severe winter storm on the Northeast where it could drop - 5 % or more today .
SATURDAY AM : Fox ’s official figure for Avatar ‘s Friday total is $ 27 M from its 3,542 total domestic theatrical release , including a slow $ 3.5 M from midnight screenings in 2,000 venues .
But the North American grosses , aided by higher 3D ticket prices , picked up steam throughout the day .
Now America ’s East Coast is slammed by a monster winter storm which could slow the movie ’s grosses .
FRIDAY 11:15 PM UPDATE : Fox insiders are telling me that Avatar will make $ 27.5 M to $ 28 M Friday .
As for the bad weather , an exec tells me : “ Storm was in the Carolinas area today / tonight and I understand that the DC area was getting hammered .
I would have to say we did get hurt in that area of the country , and I am worried about the effect in the Northeast tomorrow .
Even so , this movie is getting such an incredibly positive reaction that I believe the word of mouth is just viral and those that may have been prevented from seeing the movie today or tomorrow will be there eventually without fail . ”
FRIDAY 10 PM UPDATE : I ’m told by sources that Avatar has been playing even with Star Trek all day until about 2:30 PM PT when 20th Century Fox ’s overall gross and location average for James Cameron ’s much ballyhooed technopic started pulling ahead .
But 2D Star Trek had 400 more locations vs Avatar ‘s 3,542 total domestic theatrical release , and a shorter running time vs Avatar ‘s 160 minutes , and $ 7 M in “ pre-opening shows ” vs. Avatar ‘s $ 3.5 M midnights in about 2,000 dates with a 3D ticket price premium .
Of course , Star Trek had the benefit of decades of franchise awareness , while Avatar is a wholly new creation .
Now
Fox could be looking at mid- to high - $ 20 sM for today from its 2,038 domestic 3D locations and 3,129 North American 3D screens and 179 all 3D domestic IMAX .
Because the filmmakers are very concerned about the severe winter storm hitting America ’s East Coast and the huge negative effect it could have on the domestic box office .
If there is n’t significant attendance loss , then Hollywood is now estimating this pre-Xmas 3 - day weekend ’s opening grosses at $ 80 M — or $ 27 M for Friday including the midnight shows , then $ 30 M on Saturday , and $ 23 M on Sunday when most colleges and high schools are out Monday .
FRIDAY 9:30 AM : ‘ Twas the weekend before Christmas , but I refused to wax poetic about whether James Cameron ’s long awaited , much discussed , big budget technopic would be a gigantic hit , big hit , or modest hit until I saw some actual numbers .
That ’s because 20th Century Fox ’s Avatar finally opened in theaters last night in North America and 106 countries overseas after years of fan curiosity , followed by recent months of negative buzz , followed by the past two weeks of mostly strong reviews ( 82 % positive on Rotten Tomatoes ) .
No one is predicting disaster for the film .
Especially not after I can reveal what Steven Spielberg said after screening it on the Fox lot : “ The last time I came out of a movie feeling that way it was the first time I saw Star Wars . ”
Rival studios reported to me this morning that midnight U.S. and Canada grosses were around $ 3 million with the 3D ticket premium .
Then 20th Century Fox announced its official midnight screening gross of $ 3,537,000 , including the 3D ticket price premium , from approximately 2000 theatres .
* UPDATE : I also just heard that internationally , Avatar is huge in Australia with $ 4.8 million from Thursday and Friday combined , and running double what 2012 which did not have a 3D premium did there , or $ 2.3 million .
( By contrast , New Moon opened to $ 7.8 M . )
In Germany , Avatar debuted to $ 1.7 million , compared to 2012 ‘s $ 1.4 M .
( New Moon did $ 2.2 M . )
In Korea , Avatar opened to $ 1.4 M , behind 2012 ‘s $ 1.9 M .
( New Moon made only $ 800 K . )
But in the UK , opening day was hit by snow so grosses are running behind with Avatar $ 2.8 M vs 2012 $ 3.2 M .*
* 2ND UPDATE : Meanwhile , a giant snowstorm is expected on the America ’s East Coast , with 20 inches predicted for Washington DC . *
I ’ve learned that today ’s matinees are running about 10 % better than this summer ’s Star Trek .
But with 3D films , matinees are normally higher because a larger portion of the business is done via presales .
Then again , Fox is warning that the weekend before Christmas can be dicey for moviegoing because everyone is more focused on shopping and partying .
And weather is already a factor .
But movies which open the weekend before Christmas tend to do better multiples than normal from opening box office to lifetime .
While in the summer tentpoles tend to have lifetime grosses of 3 to 3.5 times opening weekend .
Whereas movies that open the weekend before Christmas can do 4 , 5 or even 6 times the opening weekend .
So if Avatar were to do $ 75 M to $ 85 M this weekend , it could still get to a $ 300 M - $ 400 M lifetime total which is what the movie ’s negative cost is thought to be .
Right now , Hollywood has refined its original unfocused $ 60 M - $ 75 M prediction upwards to $ 85 million for the 3 - day domestic weekend — better than the all - time December opening of I Am Legend at $ 77,211,321 but only because of Avatar ‘s 3D ticket price premium .*
Remember , this is the biggest 3D release in movie history , spurred by the excitement surrounding Cameron ’s creation of the Fusion Camera System technology for photo - realistic computer - generated characters through motion capture animation .
He wrote the script for Avatar back in the mid-1990s when he and Stan Winston co-founded Digital Domain .
But when he took the screenplay to their special effects lab , Cameron was told it was just not possible to make the film with the current technology .
So he sat on the project for more than a decade until there could be “ several thousand 3 - D screens ” capable of showing the film .
This opening weekend , Avatar is playing in 3,542 total theaters domestic ( including 2,038 3D locations and 3,129 3D screens and 179 all 3D IMAX ) , and into 17,222 screens overseas ( including a total 3D and 3D Imax screens of 5,360 , and a total IMAX 3D screens of 81 ) .
Now , that ’s a wide 2D release but by no means the widest .
And yet last night there were n’t the usual reports pouring in to me of long lines and sold - out theaters after midnight , except for the IMAX 3D venues .
Instead , Internet chatter and anecdotal accounts indicate moviehouses showing Avatar were not playing to packed houses — at least not yet .
Tracking , too , had been mixed for the film .
While there was big awareness and wannasee among males of all ages , girls and women were n’t there at all .
In fact , rival studios kept pointing out to me tht upcoming Sherlock Holmes was tracking better than Avatar in all quadrants .
Nevertheless ,
Fox is expecting Avatar to have legs domestically well into January .
In any case , it ’s expected to outperform internationally ( not unlike 2012 did earlier this holiday season . )
As for those dopey media comparisons to James Cameron ’s legendary Titanic legs ?

The streets of old Los Angeles come alive in A Bright and Guilty Place , Richard Rayner 's non-fiction account of the city at its most corrupt , during the late 1920s and early 30s .
The book , which is published tomorrow , borrows a wise - crack description of LA by Orson Welles for its title .
It details a group of interconnected characters , some forgotten , others familiar , including attorney - turned - murderer " Debonair Dave " Clark , underworld fixer Charlie Crawford ( one of Clark 's victims ) , mobster Albert Marco , crime - scene photographer Leslie White , tycoon Edward L Doheny , and oil industry executive Raymond Chandler , who was observing LA 's dark side from the sidelines , collecting material for his future career as perhaps the greatest ever writer of Angeleno crime novels .
Many of the book 's key locations can still be found , some in a better state of repair than others , all of them glowing in the refracted light of deeds and misdeeds past .
Bradford - born Rayner , who currently lives in Santa Monica , agreed to play tour guide for us , and mapped out a fascinating route from the time - warped boulevards of downtown — LA 's once bustling hub — west through Hollywood and Beverly Hills , to the ocean piers of Santa Monica and Venice .
Thanks to Rayner 's directions and on - site commentary , a forgotten city starts to emerge from the shadow of Tinseltown : a world where actors like Charlie Chaplin have cameos , and the real stars belong to the " LA System " : City Hall , the LA Police Department , and Prohibition - era gangland .
For each location , we 've recommended a suitable period song .

Rayner : " So much of the action [ in A Bright and Guilty Place ] happened in this building , but it 's quite hard to find , because it 's blotted out by the more recent Criminal Justice Center .
You have to seek it out .
It was this complete legal city : the towers at the top were the county jail back then , immediately below was the press floor , two floors of courts , and then the DA 's office .
This is where Dave Clark and Leslie White came to work every day .
It was built in 1925 , a time when the powers that be in LA imagined they were capable of erecting this grand ' city on the hill ' .
It was a real nexus of power . "

" As you look out from the top you can see how much of downtown still is from the 1920s .
Los Angeles was the fastest - growing city in the world during that decade , and it was all centred here .
A lot of the buildings are those you think of as the classic New York type of building : 10 - 12 - storey steel structures , sheathed in brownstone and glass .
Here , you get a sense that downtown back then really was this bustling business place .
Raymond Chandler fetched up here in 1912 , and no other writer really got at the geography and feel and sensuality of the place in the way that he did . "

Chandler was the vice president of the company , earning $ 12-14,000 a year , drinking a lot , apparently knocking off several of the secretaries .
When you see the few pictures of him in the late 20s he was this suave , suited , two - car business executive .
He hated working in the oil business .
He was an unhappy guy even before he got laid off by Dabney in 1932 .
So he became a pulp fiction writer , which happened slowly : when he wrote his early pulp stories , he was in his 40s . "

Note : this post is by Thomas Adams , at Paykin Krieg and Adams , LLP , and a former managing director at Ambac and FGIC , with some minor additions by yours truly .
This is a significant piece of some puzzles he , some other experts who prefer to remain anonymous , and I have been pushing on for several months .
As we have been reading the latest coverage on the AIG bailout from the SIGTARP report and the Treasury Secretary Geithner ’s Congressional testimony , a nagging question remains unresolved : why did AIG get bailed out but the monoline bond insurers did not ?
The business that caused AIG to blow up was the same that caused the bond insurers to blow up – collateralized debt obligations backed by sub - prime mortgage bonds ( ABS CDOs ) .
This was actually one of the few business that AIG Financial Products had in common with the monolines .
AIG did n’t participate in municipal insurance , MBS or other ABS deals , which were all important for the monolines .
Certainly , AIG was larger than any of the bond insurers , but in aggregate , the bond insurers had a tremendous amount of ABS CDO exposure , which at the peak was probably over $ 300 billion .
Despite AIG ’s claims to have withdrawn from subprime at the end of 2005 , we have identified particular 2006 deals with substantial subprime content that AIG most assuredly did guarantee .
In addition , the monolines had exposure to many other assets classes that AIG did not which created chaos for the holders of those bonds when the monolines were downgraded .
The chain reaction risk of the bond insurers was arguably greater , when you throw in the damage to the aucton rate securities market , which was rooted in the muni market .
In 2007 , MBIA had over $ 650 billion of par insured , Ambac had about $ 500 billion , FSA had about $ 380 billion and FGIC had about $ 300 billion .
Throwing in CIFG and XLCA , the total insured par of the monolines was about $ 2 trillion – this amount certainly would qualify as large enough to be “ systemic risk ” if the insurers were allowed to fail .
In contrast , while AIG ’s aggregate insured par was greater , the only portion that really presented a systemic risk exposure was the CDS and structured finance exposures , which had an aggregate par exposure of about $ 400 - 500 billion .
a persuasive argument could be made that the monolines were just as intertwined in the financial system as AIG and , thanks to their municipal exposure , presented as great or greater a systemic risk to the financial markets and the economy .
Yet AIG was bailed out and the monolines were not .
So what happened ?
How did the monolines get dropped and AIG get rescued ?
The popular reason given has been that AIG was so big that they affected all segments of the economy , whereas the monolines were only midsized and not critical to the economy .
i believe that SIGTARP repeated this version of events last week .
I understand that Treasury Secretary Geithner last week repeated this notion and added new information – that he was concerned about the cascading risk of AIG ’s non CDS exposure .
While this produces a bigger par exposure for AIG , these other areas did not have the huge risks of loss , have largely remained functional , and did not have the issue of collateral posting .
The risk were at the parent level , at AIG FP ; the bulk of AIG ’s business was written by regulated subsidiaries whose claims - paying ability would not be impaired by an AIG FP failure .
So , in my view , this is a fairly weak , after the fact argument .
A more plausible case might be made that AIG also had a securities lending business that had sprung a $ 20 billion leak , but that wee problem has n’t gotten much mention in the official defenses .
I have a different interpretation .
I should note that I am a former employee of a bond insurer , so I admit to a bias .
However , I my general perspective had been , until recently , that neither AIG or the bond insurers should have been rescued .
When I was at FGIC , Deutsche Bank , Lehman , Bear and UBS were all over my company with sales coverage for CDO deals .
But we never heard much from Goldman .
I was actually surprised to see that they were so big with John Paulson ’s CDO adventures ( as recently disclosed in “ The Best Trade Ever ” ) , because I never thought they were that big in the CDO market .
One big reason I did n’t know Goldman was so big in CDOs – they did n’t work with the monolines .
Goldman wanted their counterparties to post collateral so they would have protection against corporate downgrades .
The monolines refused to have collateral posting requirements in their CDS contracts .
The rating agencies supported them in this position on the argument that maintaining their AAA rating was “ fundamental to their business ” .
AIG , on the other hand , agreed to collateral posting requirements .
in fact , they used this as a competitive advantage – they got more business because of it and marketed their flexibility on this issue to the banks .
There were two the key distinctions between the monolines and AIG – first , AIG had other businesses , whose losses could threaten AIG ’s financial guarantee business while monolines promised to pay claims first , to protect investors .
Second , AIG had a history of negotiating before they paid claims ( there is an interesting history with a ABS film receivables deal where AIG refused to pay , while the monolines covered similar deals and did not have the same “ out ” in their policies .
this deal did serious damage to AIG ’s reputation in the ABS market and shut them out of many deals ) .
So despite their AAA rating , AIG was not as trusted by the structured finance and CDS market – there was a fear that AIG would wiggle out of their obligations in a way that the monolines would not .
All of the other banks got comfortable with the monolines not having to post collateral for CDS trades because of their AAA ratings .
Goldman never did .
Of course , Goldman was one of the few banks that clearly set out to profit from shorting CDOs .
They obviously realized that if their CDS counterparty was on the hook for a lot of ABS CDOs that were going to blow up , the insurance provider would likely get downgraded .
If the downgrade of the insurer was very likely , the only way the short - CDO strategy worked was if the insurer would post collateral .
So Goldman only used AIG , who would provide protection against their downgrade , which Goldman knew would happen because they were stuffing AIG with toxic ABS CDOs .
The banks that used the monolines for their ABS CDOs were making a major error by taking on the monoline downgrade risk without protection , especially if they knew that the ABS CDOs were toxic .
So I suspect that most of the banks did not really know that the ABS CDOs would be as toxic as they turned out to be .
This is , of course , what happened .
The ABS CDOs blew up , the bond insurers got downgraded , the banks that used them got crushed because their hedges against their CDO risks were now in jeopardy .
A death spiral between the monolines and the banks ensued ( the ARS meltdown added to the troubles ) .
Goldman did n’t care , because they had collateral posted by AIG once AIG got downgraded ..
All of the banks who faced the monolines had to start considering commutation deals with the monolines because it was obvious the monolines did not have enough capital to cover all of the CDO losses .
in these commutations , the banks accepted payments as low as 40 cents on the dollar .
Most of the monoline ratings roubles had unfolded earlier in 2008 – many of them had been downgraded , several commutations had already occurred by the time of the AIG bailout .
AIG managed to put off the threat of serious downgrade for a long time , despite the junk in their portfolio ( as 2008 progressed , it was a mystery to me and many others why the onolines were being downgraded but AIG was not ) .
While AIG had been downgraded to AA some time earlier , this had n’t caused much of a disruption because the real trigger for collateral posting was if they went below AA .
For a variety of reasons , this was n’t a threat until September of 2008 .
I hate to get sucked into the vampire squid line of thinking about Goldman , but the only explanation i can think of for why AIG got rescued and the monolines did not is because Goldman had significant exposure to AIG and did not have exposure to the monolines .
When it became clear that AIG could face bankruptcy , Goldman ’s plan to profit by shorting ABS CDOs was threatened .
While they had the collateral posted , thanks to the downgrades , this collateral could be tied up or lost if AIG went bankrupt .
This was a real crisis for Goldman – they thought they had outsmarted the subprime market with their ABS CDOs and outsmarted all of the other banks by getting collateral posting from AIG when they got downgraded .
But if AIG went away , this strategy would have blown up and cost Goldman billions .
All of this is essentially factual and based , for the most part , on public information .
As a matter of speculation , i believe that Goldman and their helpers deliberately pumped up the media with the threats that the subprime market posed in order to hasten the collapse of the subprime market .
this allowed them to realize their gains sooner from shorting ABS CDOs – they had become impatient waiting for it to blow up .
In addition , I believe that Goldman and their helpers – including their many connections with the White House and the Fed – pumped up concerns about the systemic risk that the market was facing from a Lehman and AIG failure , so that they could force the government to step in and bail out AIG .
This would also explain why Lehman was not bailed out .
Lehman did n’t really matter to Goldman .
But the fear created by Lehman ’s failure served as a good excuse for why they should rescue AIG .
I have been wondering why the sub - prime market blow up led to such a massive crisis when subprime and structured finance had experienced big problems before without the issue of systemic risk and financial market collapse .
Certainly , the ABS CDOs were toxic and caused big holes , but not so big that it could n’t be addressed by an RTC type of clearing system .
Various analyst reports of the bad subprime deals ( and ABS CDOs ) makes it pretty clear that the 2006 - 2007 vintages were the worst and will probably only create about $ 500 - 700 million of aggregate losses .
Terrible , but not insurmountable .
This leads me to conclude that the bailout was prompted by fear mongering and deliberate strategies and manipulation on the part of Goldman and a few select others , to make sure that AIG would be bailed out to protect their trades in shorting ABS CDOs .
i believe that John Paulson benefited from this bailout , on his $ 5 billon or so of ABS CDOs with AIG .
But not as much as Goldman benefited themselves , via Abacus and , perhaps , other deals .
AIG , Goldman and ABS CDOs were tied together at the center of the crisis .
From Goldman ’s perspective , all of the other participants were secondary – they had no exposure to the monolines and they were probably hedged against the other banks .
The only loose end was the collateral posted by AIG .
The final question that this raises for me : would it have been cheaper for the government and the taxpayer to have bailed out the bond insurers instead of AIG ?
The total amount of CDOs and credit default swaps that would have needed to be guaranteed would have been smaller .
In the number of investors across the market that would have benefited would probably have been larger .
The auction rate securities market , the muni market , the investors that held bond insurer exposure to MBS and ABS would have all benefited .
None of these markets were aided by AIG ’s bailout .
But a bond insurer bailout would not have helped Goldman much and the AIG bailout did .
Yves here .
Note I differ with Tom on how much Goldman could or did pump up subprime fears .
A lot of people focused on Jan Hatzius ’ bearish calls on financial system losses , but quite a few people in a position to know claim that Hatzius is not the sort to take commercially expedient views .
But once the asset - backed commercial paper started imploding in August 2007 , the officialdom was very much engaged .
So if one can connect the dots between Goldman and the fear and loathing that hit the ABCP market ( recall all paper was repudiated as in being possibly tainted by subprime ) , the story becomes very tidy .
Update 1:50 PM
Another possible gap in this line of thinking are the now - infamous AIG regulatory capital swaps , which allowed European banks to carry much less equity ( or put it another way , pump up their balance sheets much bigger than they would have otherwise been ) .
But there has been a remarkable lack of coverage of this issue .
That would be one reason to save AIG and not the monolines .
There is n’t any evidence that this issue factored into official thinking .
That could mean that the officialdom has scrupulously avoided mentioning it ( as in why alert the peasants that their tax dollars are supporting profligate Eurobanks ) , but Sorkin ’s Too Big to Fail makes clear that AIG itself was not on top of how badly the ship was leaking , so if AIG did n’t bring this issue up as a need to be rescued , no one would have factored that into their decisions .
One way to be certain would be to compel disclosure of the phone logs during the AIG scramble .
A absence of calls to European banking regulators would be indirect confirmation that these swaps were not one of the proximate causes of the AIG rescue .
WOODBURY , New York ( AP ) 
A New York man is donating his 320th pint of blood this week , making him one of two people in the U.S. who has given 40 gallons .
Seventy - five - year - old Al Fischer of Massapequa plans to reach the milestone Tuesday , 58 years after he started giving blood .
According to a New York Blood Center official , only 83 - year - old Maurice Wood has donated more blood than Fischer .
Wood is a retired railroad inspector from St. Louis .
Fischer , a print shop operator , donates blood about six times a year .
He says he and Wood are engaged in a friendly rivalry and last spoke to each other a few months ago .
Long Island Blood Services executive director Harvey Schaffler says Fischer has helped almost 1,000 people .

Streep ’s famous transparency allows audiences to witness everything , just as it does with the camera .
“ There are quick changes of mood — extraordinary , like quicksilver — and you can see them on her skin , ” Lacombe says .
“ When someone has a strong emotion or is about to cry , when the skin becomes blotchy and red and the eyes swell up — I ’ve seen that happening with Meryl in such a subtle way .
There is the ability to be in emotional places , and I think that ’s why she is the actress she is . ”
Although Streep ’s acting is inextricably connected with the way she looks , she has always struck Lacombe as being virtually unique among performers .
“ I think there is a big absence of vanity in Meryl , ” Lacombe says .
“ In A Cry in the Dark , she portrayed a character who was quite unsympathetic , but you never got the sense that she was trying to put you on her side , as some actors do .
That ’s another great , endearing quality of hers —
I ’m sure women sense that Meryl does not have any vanity .
She never acted as a woman who was entitled .
You know how some beautiful women just act beautiful ?
There is never any of that with Meryl — never .
“ With others , they are hypnotized by their own image , especially fashion people ; they get completely enraptured .
How many shots can you see of the same actress looking beautiful in every magazine ?
It ’s like falling into a false sense of beauty and being worshipped for all the wrong reasons .
They all do it .
A lot of it is huge insecurity .
Many actresses wo n’t wear their hair in a certain way , because it ’s not the most flattering , or they wo n’t be photographed from a certain angle .
But once someone like Meryl chooses a part , she does what is good for the character .
She does n’t bring her own insecurities and fears . ”
As she ages , Streep ’s work derives additional power from her refusal to alter her face with cosmetic surgery or Botox .
“ If you start to do something like that , it ’s very hard to stop , ” Lacombe says .
“ If you understand that what makes your work good is not the way you look , as you grow older you take different parts .
It ’s like women in real life who want to hang on to a certain part of their life , and to look younger .
They miss every other stage of their life .
To try to stop the time , to look young — it ’s such a futile , absurd way to look at life in general , and it ’s very detrimental to their work .
They may think that it prolongs their work , and maybe they might get one or two parts more , but their face is their tool , and also what they understand about life , what they go through in life .
If you alter it , you deprive yourself of some of what you need to do your work well . ”
Streep ’s disdain for such desperate measures is based on her assessment of the toll they take .
“ When I see it in people I meet , it ’s like an interruption in communication with them , ” she says .
“ It ’s like a flag in front of the view , and that , for an actor , is like wearing a veil — it ’s not a good thing . ”
This attitude has long made Streep the perfect photographic subject for Lacombe .
“ I ’m so anti all the artifice , ” Lacombe says .
“ What I do is very simple ; I ’m not interested in transforming people . ”
She gestures to the enormous coffee - table book of her work , Lacombe , which was published in 2008 and contains several riveting pictures of Streep .
“ To me , that ’s Meryl , not an actress , ” Lacombe says .
“ But it ’s very rare .
Even actresses in their 20s and 30s cannot look at themselves that way .
They all long to be looking like a model — and then they wonder , Why am I not Meryl Streep ?
To me , physical beauty is not enough ; it ’s not interesting .
Beauty is everything .
You want to have someone who will also be funny , who will also be moving , who will also be intelligent — someone who will have some contribution to bring , not just a look .
Meryl is interesting ; she is very funny and very smart .
There will in fact be a vote on gay marriage in the lame duck session of the New Jersey state legislature on Thursday , NBCNewYork.com has learned .
" We 're gonna post the bill and see what happens , " Senate President Dick Codey told us .
Codey , and even sponsors of same sex marriage legislation are skeptical if there are enough votes to pass in the State Senate .
For days now , Codey has been weighing whether or not to allow a vote in the waning days of this session , which ends next Monday .
" The members for the most part said go ahead and post it , " Codey explained in coming to his decision , while acknowledging there was a minority of his fellow democrats who urged him not to bring it to a vote .
Codey said he will post it for debate and a vote Thursday afternoon .
The leading advocate for same sex marriage , Steve goldstein of Garden State Equality , said he looks forward to the debate .
" Senator Codey is a great supporter of equality and at least he kept his commitment to our community , " Goldstein said , referring to the defections of several senators who Goldstein said had promised to support gay marriage , but then changed their minds after the November election .
A lead opponent of the bill , John Tomicki , president of the New Jersey Coalition to Protect and Preserve Marriage , does n't believe same sex marriage can pass .
" The votes are n't there , " said Tomicki , though he quickly added , " what they should be doing is let the people decide the issue , " referring to his preference for a public referendum .
In recent years , some three dozen states have asked voters to decide the issue , and gay marriage has lost every time .
If the bill does pass the State Senate , it would go to the Assembly which would also have to debate , and then hold a final vote on Monday , the last day of the session .
Outgoing Governor Jon Corzine has said repeatedly that he would sign it into law if it passes .
Incoming Governor Chris Christie , who takes the oath of office January 19th , has said just as many times that he would veto it if it ever gets to his desk .
I 've never known a season like it .
Women 's shoes are higher , strappier and more impractical than ever , and they 're walking ( excuse the pun ) out of stores as fast as shop assistants can wrap them .
Last weekend 's queues for limited edition Jimmy Choos at UK branches of the Swedish fashion chain H&M puzzled ordinary mortals ( mainly men ) who do n't get the shoe thing , but I understood them perfectly .
I yearned for the cage heels which enclose the foot and ankle in delicate black straps , but I happened to be in a city where , maddeningly , the local branch of H&M did n't stock them .
So I went to a party in a pair of black satin ankle boots with four - inch gold heels I found in a department store .
There is a school of thought which holds that women who wear impossibly high heels are dupes of fashion .
Stiletto heels are supposed to diminish us , exposing us as creatures who are prepared to endure torture to please men or advertise our boyfriends ' wealth .
In fact , most of the women I see in shoe shops ( and believe me , I spend a lot of time in shoe shops ) are buying shoes for themselves .
Unlike Linda Grant , who wrote recently about the secret pleasure of comfortable shoes , I do n't see any need to choose between heels and flats ; if I 'm setting off for a party by public transport I take my stilettos with me and change into them when I arrive .
High heels are empowering , and not just because they add inches to my height .
If you love them – and I accept some women do n't – high heels make you feel terrific .
They 're a form of display , accentuating the natural curves of the leg and drawing attention to a woman 's sexuality .
After decades of deconstructing traditional femininity , they 're a means of embracing aspects of it – but through choice , not a passive acceptance of cultural norms .
And choice is what matters here , which is why the TUC was right to object to women being forced to wear high heels by their employers .
It 's also important to point out that many of today 's high heels are versions of the platform shoe championed in the 1930s by Salvatore Ferragamo , who wanted to make heels easier to wear .
Platform shoes used to be mocked mercilessly , not least when Elton John took them to ridiculous heights , but these days they do n't raise an eyebrow .
Women 's heels seem to get higher in recessions , and it 's pretty obvious that this season 's fantastic shapes are an act of defiance against economic gloom .
But the argument about what they represent – female empowerment versus male domination – has being going on for decades , if not centuries .
The fashion historians Giorgio Riello and Peter McNeil point out in Shoes : A History from Sandals to Sneakers that the suffragettes wore heels in the early 20th century as " a means of establishing femininity " ; they wore button boots and high - heeled sports shoes to demonstrate that getting the vote would not " defeminise " women .
" The transformation of signifiers of commodified sex into respectable attire was a trend that would increasingly define women 's fashion of the 20th and 21st centuries , " they say .
They 're right : high heels are sexual , and those of us who wear them are making a statement about women 's right to be sexual on our own terms , without being taunted as " whores " .
With so much political theory behind them , high heels declare that there 's no contradiction between being serious and decorative ; that 's why my website is about human rights , feminism and shoes .
Even though I missed out on a pair of Jimmy Choos , I absolutely love the fact that this winter 's heels are art for feet .
This information should benefit anyone involved in Islamic organizations , but it really needs extra attention from those in leadership positions in their communities to start to effect the type of change needed to prevent dysfunction .

Set it and collect blessings from Allah ( swt ) for the khayr you 're supporting without thinking about it .
These are laid out by Patrick Lencioni in his book , The Five Dysfunctions of a Team : A Leadership Fable .
While the pertinence to a professional or corporate environment is obvious , these are at the core of the problems faced by Masajid and Islamic organizations across the country .
1. Absence of Trust
The fear of being vulnerable with team members prevents the building of trust within the team .
Understanding trust means refining our notions of the term .
Trust means knowing the others around you have good intentions , and that you do n’t need to shield yourself around them .
It is distinct from reliance , which is “ trusting ” that a peer will perform a given task reliably .
Trust is being able to open up , and show vulnerability while knowing that those vulnerabilities wo n’t be used against you .
What we find with many Islamic organizations is that people ’s actions are dictated by what others will think about them .
Think about the person elected to be the Masjid treasurer with no accounting or financial experience whatsoever .
This person continues to do this job day in and day out , despite not being able to do it well .
Instead , this person is focusing on holding this position for strategic reasons vis-a - vis others within the organization .
He is constantly trying to protect himself .
If trust existed within the organization , he would be able to display that vulnerability and instead be 100 % focused on performing the treasurer duties to the best of his ability .
It is commonplace that the higher ranking members in these organizations are usually the “ well - educated ” ones ( e.g. the “ doctor uncle ” ) .
One thing we often fail to realize is that these people have been trained their entire lives to be competitive with their peers and constantly outperform them .
Personal reputations are at stake .
If these instincts can not be ‘ turned off ’ for the betterment of the organization , then a lot of time is invested into managing the fallout .
Examples of this include having constant meetings to manage people ’s behaviors , and seeing a decrease in the willingness of organization members to help one another .
Organizationally , another factor that contributes to a loss of trust is not identifying and utilizing people ’s skills .
How can trust exist in a masjid construction project when a Muslim contractor who has been managing construction projects for a living for over 20 years is sitting around while the organization turns over the masjid construction plans to a pediatrician ?
This is the fundamental building block to freeing Islamic organizations of dysfunction , and it is perhaps the hardest because it requires the greatest overhaul in attitude and environment .
Once established however , it can foster constructive conflict .
2. Fear of Conflict
The desire to preserve artificial harmony stifles the occurrence of productive , ideological conflict .
- Important concept to understand : Ideological conflict vs. Personal conflict -
Have you ever met a husband and wife who never had an argument with one another ?
Have you ever met a parent that never had a disagreement with his or her children ?
Did n’t think so .
Why do we expect that Islamic organizations should operate under some kind of happy - go - lucky utopia ?
To preserve this naive notion of how things should be , we avoid engaging in any kind of conflict .
What ends up happening then is that direct conflict is avoided within the organization , but it is replaced with back - stabbing , personal conflicts , and politics .
You have seen the organization where there may be a body of 7 people .
3 of them meet separately , and 4 of them meet separately .
Then they concoct conspiracy theories about how the opposing camp really feels about an issue , and why they are pushing a particular position over another .
Then they get riled up , and go out to the community seeking more support for their own side .
Next thing you know , it ’s an all out community conflict with name - calling , people not talking to each other , and the conflict finally erupting at a dinner party at some innocent person ’s house while the innocent bystanders try to enjoy some chicken biryani .
Muslim organizations simply seem to want to avoid having any healthy conflict ( discussion ) .
This is why they all dread meetings that are boring , and where nothing gets done .
When organization members trust each other , they can talk freely with one another and debate the merits of different ideas .
Sit down and completely hash it out .
A certain level of maturity is of course required , so that the debate does not turn personal .
The element of trust is what allows people to freely credit or discredit ideas without worrying about hurting someone ’s feelings ( and then later making personal attacks behind their back ) .
Meetings should be lively and focus on the concepts and ideas being discussed – even if they become emotional .
Let people be passionate about why they feel that a certain project is a waste of money , or that the dome of the masjid should be 25 feet in diameter instead of 30 feet , and so on .
This is important because once the merits of an idea have been thoroughly discussed , everyone has had a chance to air their objections or concerns , and people can respond to them .
So let the best ideas win .
Once that is done , even the people who initially opposed the idea , can support it from an organizational perspective .
Contrast this with a board member who unwillingly votes in favor of a certain project , waiting for it to fail , then running around telling the community , “ I told you so ! ”
3. Lack of Commitment
The lack of clarity or buy - in prevents team members from making decisions to which they will commit .
Commitment only comes from the step above – once everyone ’s perspectives and opinions have been heard , they can all buy into the concept knowing that all ideas have been considered .
And of course , that discussion cannot take place without step 1 – establishing trust .
According to Lencioni , the two biggest factors hindering commitment are :
Desire for consensus
Need for certainty
It seems many Islamic organizations refuse to move forward even one step without both of those being in place .
Finding consensus is a nearly impossible task , and consensus is usually sought out of fear of backlash .
It seems leaders are unwilling to make decisions without 100 % support in case something goes wrong , they can defend themselves .
This is unhealthy for the growth of any organization .
People do not need to agree with a decision in order to support it .
As long as their ideas have been properly heard ( explained in the step above ) , then they can rally around the decision – even if they disagree with it .
The need for certainty is closely related to the phenomenon of analysis paralysis .
Organizations are unwilling to make a decision until a certain amount of data is available to them – at which point it might be too late .
They have an innate need to feel like they have made the correct decision .
Often times , a decision will need to be made quickly , and without the benefit of having all of the relevant information available .
It is important to decide , and move on .
Better to go down swinging then not show up at all .
We are blessed with Istikharah and shura .
Utilize them .
Constantly delaying a decision , or flip - flopping back and forth will not help you make the correct choice , instead it will just kill your credibility .
Symptoms of lack of commitment include : ambiguity about direction and priorities , lack of confidence , fear of failure , and revisiting issues over and over for discussion .
Islamic organizations need to clearly define their goals , rally around those common objectives , create an environment of learning from mistakes , and moving forward without regret .
The Prophet ( sal - Allahu ‘ alayhi was - Sallam ) said the believer is not bitten from the same hole twice .
We cannot demand perfection , but we demand the best effort .
4. Avoidance of Accountability
The need to avoid interpersonal discomfort prevents team members from holding one another accountable .
Lack of clarity and direction ( as explained in the step above ) makes it impossible to hold anyone accountable .
How can someone be accountable if they do not know what is expected in the first place ?
Successful organizations must have an environment in place where people are able to call each other out for not living up to their standards .
This should be the case whether positions are paid or unpaid .
People are uncomfortable letting others know that their performance may not be up to the expected standards because they fear losing a volunteer , or perhaps even a friendship .
Letting these feelings fester though , will only cause those relationships to deteriorate .
It is time for Islamic organizations to stop settling , and demand the best – even if it requires some personal discomfort along the way .
Doing this will actually develop mutual respect amongst the people working within the organization because they know they are equally being held to the same high standards by one another .
If this accountability is not there , then people begin to simply look out for their own self - interests over and above the interests of the organization .
5. Inattention to Results
The pursuit of individual goals and personal status erodes the focus on collective success .
Once an organization has clearly defined its goals and objectives , it must focus on meeting them .
When an organization loses sight of those results , their attention shifts elsewhere .
Lencioni says ‘ elsewhere ’ in this case would be team and individual status :
Team Status : For [ some ] , merely being part of the group is enough to keep them satisfied .
For them , the achievement of specific results might be desirable , but not necessarily worthy of great sacrifice or inconvenience .
As ridiculous and dangerous as this might seem , plenty of teams fall prey to the lure of status .
These often include altruistic nonprofit organizations that come to believe that the nobility of their mission is enough to justify their satisfaction … as they often see success in merely being associated with their special organizations .
Individual Status :
This refers … [ to people focusing ] on enhancing their own positions … at the expense of the team .
The collective results must be more important than individual aims and objectives .
One important note is the relationship of this dysfunction to the issue of trust ( step 1 ) .
Individuals getting involved must also cleanse their hearts of any ill intentions such as seeking fame and credit in the community .
The eventual breakdown of an entire organization can start from the simplest of individual wants or intentions .
Concluding Thoughts
Lencioni summarized it best :
And so , like a chain with just one link broken , teamwork deteriorates if even a single dysfunction is allowed to flourish .
Another way to understand this model is to take the opposite approach – a positive one – and imagine how members of a truly cohesive team behave :
They trust one another .
They engage in unfiltered conflict around ideas .
They commit to decisions and plans of action .
They hold one another accountable for delivering against those plans .
They focus on the achievement of collective results .

( CNN ) -- Joe Cahn calls tailgates the last great American neighborhoods .
On Saturdays , especially in the South , tailgating means having a party with thousands of your friends , old and new .
College campuses are full of makeshift tent communities , where there are no privacy fences separating neighbors .
It 's just a bunch of folks having some drinks , grilling out and actually talking to each other .
" Even if you are not a football fan , you can be a fan of tailgating , " Cahn says from his home in New Orleans , Louisiana , where he is looking forward to his seventh trip to the Army - Navy game in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in December .
And that 's as much for the camaraderie as it is for the game itself .
You see , Cahn loves , loves , loves a good tailgate , and he has seen a few in his new line of " work . "
He 's been to more than 500 in the past decade since he sold his New Orleans School of Cooking and started the Web site tailgating .com .
His travels include more than 120 college games for the self - described " Commissioner of Tailgating . "
If anyone knows where the party is , it 's Cahn .
Take , for example , his trips to pregame parties at Ford Field in Detroit , Michigan , which annually hosts a game on Thanksgiving Day .
Detroit partiers trick out their tailgates in very cool ways -- literally and figuratively .
Recently Cahn found himself enjoying a dip in a hot tub , despite 25 - degree temperatures .
As for college tailgates , Cahn 's been to all the top spots .
The first one he enthusiastically mentions is the school that was repeatedly mentioned by many fans and frequent college football tailgaters : Oxford , Mississippi , home of Ole Miss .
They tailgate in an area known as The Grove , for its many oaks , elms and magnolias .
It opens the night before a game at 6 , and you need to get there early to set up your spot .
Cahn says the people are super - friendly even to fans of opposing teams .
When asked about Ole Miss , male fans of other Southeastern Conference schools pointed to the scenery -- and we 're not talking about the trees .
The same tailgaters can be found in the same place year after year , and enterprising undergrads set up tents for alumni for as much as a few hundred bucks .
Many fans wear their best clothes and use crystal on their tables .
Everyone feels comfortable leaving their food out ( except the deviled eggs ) , even during the game , because sharing truly is caring .
And if you do n't cook any food , you can always stop by Abner 's for some chicken tenders .
As a tailgater once told The New York Times : " We may not win every game .
But we 've never lost a party . "
Other hot spots
The SEC takes its tailgating very seriously .
The Georgia - Florida game in Jacksonville , Florida , is known informally as the World 's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party , and Cahn says the event is not overhyped .
Hundreds of thousands of fans travel to it , and after the tailgate takes a break for the game , most head to bars to watch .
Another popular spot is Baton Rouge , Louisiana , home of Louisiana State , where the food is the best in the league , several frequent tailgaters say .
The menu even includes alligator .
( Fans from Gainesville , Florida , probably go for jambalaya or gumbo instead . )
And there 's plenty of food for everyone .
" Louisiana people can't cook for just one or two people , " Cahn says .
Outside - of - conference notables include University Park , Pennsylvania , home to Penn State and Beaver Stadium , the largest college stadium , with more than 107,000 seats .
Cahn says the fall weather does n't deter the Nittany Lions fans , and there is a ton of room to tailgate .
He also likes sterngating in Seattle , Washington , where Husky Stadium sits near Lake Washington .
On Saturdays , a few thousand fans arrive by boat .
What to bring
Before you pack the car -- or boat -- for the trip , it 's important to make a checklist , Cahn says .
You might need to buy a few items before heading to the game and firing up the grill .
That includes a small fire extinguisher .
Let 's face it , not everyone who will be milling through your party will be sound of legs .
One stumble , one knocked - over grill , and there will be a few panicked moments .
And if you 're using charcoal , you 'll need an extra gallon of water to douse the fire when you 're done cooking .
You do n't want to miss the first quarter because you were waiting for the coals to cool .
" People will buy these little grills and roast some hot dogs , " says Clint Cantwell , a champion barbecuer from New York whose blog is http://blog.smokeindaeye.com/.
" They do n't want to lose the grill , so they put the lid on , close up the vents and stick them under their car .
You do n't want to lose a $ 25,000 car because you wanted to save a $ 25 grill . "
If you 're doing the cooking , he also suggested buying an organizer with a few plastic drawers where you can keep things like a can opener and salt and pepper shakers .
Toilet paper is also a necessity .
The closer it gets to kickoff , the more fans will be using the portable toilets .
You do n't want to get , um , stuck with your pants down .
One frequent tailgater -- a friend who has been to more than 90 stadiums -- says it 's important to have a generator , especially since you will want to bring a TV to watch the pregame show -- or your conference rivals go down in flames .
But check first ; some schools do n't approve of generators .
And bring Cornhole -- it 's a game -- or a Frisbee or a football to toss around .
If you 're an invitee , not the inviter , just check with the host to see what you can bring , Cahn says .
It 's like being on a team , not everyone has to be the quarterback .
Some of us like being the " lineman " who gets to bring the dip and the chips .
Cantwell and Cahn say getting things ready at home is crucial .
Maybe you do like standing over the grill while others are chatting , drinking and having fun .
Maybe it 's your alone time .
But why not make the burgers , the chili or the bacon wrap sausages the day before ?
You can heat them up at the tailgate , and they are just as tasty .
In this article , we shall tell you how to maintain a classic cooling system in classic cars .
The main thing that you need to know is that for the large part of the 1940 ’s cars and the later cars , the cooling systems are pretty good , but unless you are putting in a bigger engine , or adding air conditioning to a car that previously did n’t have it , your stock system should ideally serve you well .
But it might be the case that the cooling system of your classic car is n’t performing as well as it should , even after 50 years , so we tell you how to maintain a classic cooling system .
First of all , you need to think about the radiator .
The radiators from that time were designed for low , or no pressure radiator caps , and straight ( preferably distilled ) water , with a rust inhibitor for all times except winter .
But do n’t make the mistake of running coolant on a system intended for straight water – it ’ll run hotter !
Some people recommend a 50 - 50 coolant - to - water combination , with a high pressure radiator cap .
The coolant would prevent corrosion in aluminum blocks , and would raise the boiling point of the coolant , in any high pressure system .
Now think about the leaks in classic cars .
Sometimes , if you have a radiator rebuilt , the shop would detach its tanks , hot - tank it to clean it , rod out the core to remove the scale , and then solder up the leaks .
However , you should know that this is only a temporary situation .
The stuff would clog the tubes , and you would probably be let down at the worst moment possible .
Let ’s talk about clogs now – sometimes it might be the case that you have a problem of overheating , and you think it ’s a clogged radiator , so you fill the system and run the engine till the thermostat opens .
You know when it ’s open because the water in the upper radiator tank start moving – you can see this through the filler neck .
But you know you have a faulty thermostat if the water does n’t start moving .
So here ’s what you do next – feel carefully the front of the radiator with your hand .
It should be cooler at the bottom and hot at the top – there should be no cold spots anywhere .
You know your radiator is clogged , if you find cold spots .
So ideally , back - flush it , and then test it again .
Now about back - flushing – ideally you could remove the radiator for this operation , drain it , disconnect the hoses , unbolt it from the frame , and lift it out .
Then wrap rags around the end of your garden hose to stifle the leaks , and insert it into the lower opening on the radiator .
Turn the water on full blast .
Since you are reversing the normal flow of water through the radiator , you would get behind the scale and rust , break it loose , and force it out .
Until the water becomes clear , keep flushing .
However , before re-installing the radiator , back - flush the cooling system too .
Do you want to avoid a mess ?
Then attach a radiator hose to the water pump inlet to direct the rust and discharged water down and under the vehicle .
The thermostat housing should be removed , then take out the thermostat , replace the thermostat housing , and then put it in the rag - wrapped hose in the thermostat housing , and force the water back through the engine and the water pump .
Similarly , keep doing this till the water becomes clear .
Now we shall tell you how to maintain a classic cooling system of classic cars .
If you see damage and corrosion on the lower end of the tank , the classic radiator needs to be replaced .
You should check the coolant – if it ’s rusty , back - flush the system .
The radiator cap should ideally be changed every 2 years .
Do n’t install a cap with pressure rating of more than original .
You could blow out the water pump seal if you do .
The old side valve engines do n’t cool so well anymore , but if you keep the system clean and drive the car well , it will be fine , do n’t worry .
The thermostat of classic carsshould be changed every 2 years , and make sure you install it facing the right way .

The Strasbourg court has been hearing a case involving two people stopped near an arms fair in London in 2003 .
It said that Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton 's right to respect for a private and family life was violated .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was disappointed with the ruling and would appeal against it .
Chief Constable Craig Mackey of the Association of Chief Police Officers said officers would continue to use stop and search powers while the appeal was pending .
' Discriminatory use ' Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows the home secretary to authorise police to make random searches in certain circumstances .
But the European Court of Human Rights said the pair 's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated .
The court said the stop and search powers were " not sufficiently circumscribed " and there were not " adequate legal safeguards against abuse " .

It also concluded that " the risks of the discriminatory use of the powers " were " a very real consideration " .
The pair were awarded 33,850 euros ( £ 30,400 ) to cover legal costs .
They were both stopped outside the Defence Systems and Equipment International exhibition at the Excel Centre in London Docklands in 2003 , where there had already been protests and demonstrations .
Mr Gillan , 32 , from London , was detained by police for about 20 minutes as he was cycling to join the demonstration .
Ms Quinton , 39 , a journalist from London , was in the area to film the protests .
She said she felt she was detained for about 30 minutes , although police records said it was five minutes .
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's
The World At One , Ms Quinton said she hoped the ruling would lead to the government drawing up a " fairer body of legislation to protect us " .
She said : " The court has n't said that there 's no longer any scope for stops and searches , but that safeguards need to be in place to prevent misuse of these powers , because right now if somebody is stopped and searched , they have got no redress if they feel they were mistreated during the stop and search process .
" It 's not about saying that there 's no need for stop and search .
What we 're really saying is people have a right to privacy and there needs to be a balance between police powers to ensure our safety but also our rights to a private life . "
Parliamentarians must finally sort out this mess
Corinna Ferguson
Liberty Mr Gillan said : " It 's fantastic news after a long struggle .
I look to the government for a strong response . "
Both were represented by Corinna Ferguson , legal officer for Liberty , who said the pressure group had " consistently warned " the government about the " dangers " of the powers .
Ms Ferguson added : " The public , police and Court of Human Rights all share our concerns for privacy , protest , race equality and community solidarity that come with this sloppy law .
" In the coming weeks , parliamentarians must finally sort out this mess . "
But Policing and Security Minister David Hanson said he was disappointed at the decision given that the government had won all previous challenges in the UK courts .
He said : " Stop and search under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is an important tool in a package of measures in the ongoing fight against terrorism . "
A statement by the Metropolitan Police said the powers remained " an important tactic in our counter terrorism strategy " .
' Balancing exercise ' Lord Carlile , the government 's independent reviewer of anti-terrorist legislation , told the World At One that the implications of the ruling were potentially " quite serious " and may require a change in the law .
He added : " In my view , section 44 is being used far too often on a random basis without any reasoning behind its use .
" The fundamental point that the court is making is that it increases the possibility of random interference with the legitimate liberties of the citizen .
" On the other hand , we have to be safe against terrorism .
There is therefore a very difficult balancing exercise to be done and I 'm sure Section 44 will come under intelligent scrutiny in the coming months . "
The decision overturned a 2003 High Court ruling - subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the use of stop and search , and any consequent violation of human rights , was proportionate under the European Convention on Human Rights and justified in the light of the threat of terrorism .
The Section 44 search powers have proved controversial , and in May last year the Metropolitan Police in London said they would be scaled back .
The force had faced criticism that such searches had been alienating people from ethnic minorities in the capital .
Its commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , said the powers should be restricted to " iconic " sites , including Parliament and Buckingham Palace .

It was only a matter of time before the nations skyrocketing unemployment translated into new recruits for the most powerful military force in the world .
With the official US unemployment rate at 10 percent and climbing ( that s more than 15 million people struggling to put food on the table ) and nearly double that number if you include part - time wage - earners who need full - time jobs , never mind all of those discouraged workers ,  its little wonder that so many of the nations jobless are flocking into its military recruitment offices .
After all , what better way for an unemployed American worker to survive the Great Recession of 2009 than in the service of his or her country ?
Americans have a long history of consuming and / or killing their way out of crisis .
And it is nt looking as if that model will be up for reassessment anytime soon .
The parameters of what we like to call the national conversation are as narrow as ever , and they are not widening under the current leadership .
So far at least , even Obamas  Clean Energy Economy  has failed to deliver enough green jobs  ( or any other color jobs for that matter ) to begin the process of meaningful transition .
With the season of consuming just around the corner , many Americans  especially those in blue - collar jobs like construction , manufacturing and retail service  are staring into the economic abyss .
It is hardly surprising in such an environment that a young person with dismal employment prospects and plummeting self - esteem would be easily seduced by an ad that promises more than $ 49,000 in GI Bill Benefits  as does the US militarys current promo .
The same ad promises that young recruits can connect with military and veteran - friendly schools that offer VA approved education programs ,  or get information about high - paying degrees like Criminal Justice , IT and Legal Studies .
So , when the Pentagon announced on October 13 , 2009 that the military had met all of its recruitment goals for the first time since 1973 , and that this just happened to coincide with the highest national unemployment rate since the government started keeping track in 1976 , it wasnt surprising that the news was met with a Big National Yawn .

The Few , the Proud , the Desperate
It s hard not to wonder what would happen if , instead of dutifully reading from the Pentagons script on October 13 , the media had done their job and informed the public about the real nature of the service that potential enlistees were signing up for .
Maybe if they had , those recruitment officers would not have been quite so busy recruiting  and stealing the lives of  unsuspecting young people in desperate need of employment .
Maybe those eager masses of young men and women wouldnt have been so hot to sign up if , for instance , they understood that anyone enlisting in the military right now  whatever branch  is required to sign a document that states : " Laws and regulations that govern military personnel may change without notice to me .
Such changes may affect my status , pay allowances , benefits and responsibilities as a member of the Armed Forces REGARDLESS of the provisions of this enlistment / re-enlistment document . 

Army of None : Strategi ...
Aimee Allison , David S... Best Price : $ 3.31 Buy New $ 7.90 ( as of 10:30 EST - Details )
In their book Army of None , published in 2007 , Aimee Allison and David Solnit advise those who expect the military to pay for their college to read the fine print .
The authors point out that only a fraction of recruits who signed up for the Montgomery GI Bill received a dime , and that 65 percent received no money at all for college . 
If you receive a less than honorable discharge ( as one in four do ) , leave the military early ( as one in three do ) , or later decide not to go to college ,  the military will keep your deposit and give you nothing . 
And when it comes to those signing bonuses , maybe if potential recruits understood that they will be forced to repay the money if he or she leaves the military before the agreed term of service ( that s eight years for first - time enlistees ) , perhaps they would reconsider signing away life and limb to get it .
If those same applicants understood the army data from 2007 revealing that the top bonus of $ 20,000 was given to only 6 percent of enlistees who signed up for active duty , they might have figured out another way to survive the recession .
They might be further divested of their illusions if they knew that military statistics show that 48 percent of enlistees report having financial difficulty  and that some 33 percent of homeless men in the US are veterans , with nearly 200,000 veterans homeless on any given night .
And another thing :
The military does not have to place recruits in their chosen career field or give them the specific training requested .
Even if enlistees do receive training , it is often to develop skills that will not transfer to the civilian job market  like firing an M 240 machine gun .
By the way : Military recruiters are notorious liars .
Back in 2004 , the New York Times reported that nearly one in five US Army recruiters was investigated for offenses ranging from u201 Cthreats and coercion to false promises that applicants would not be sent to Iraq.
u201D
It s doubtful that has changed just because the focus is now on Afghanistan .
One veteran recruiter told a reporter for the Albany Times Union that , after recruiting for years , he couldnt think of one recruiter who was n’t dishonest about it , admitting that ,  I did it myself . "
Military Service Is Not the Only Option
Just because the Obama administration lacks the political courage to challenge the status quo doesnt mean there are no other options .
But Americans will need to unlearn a lot of what weve been taught if there is to be a meaningful transition to a peacetime economy .
We will need , for instance , to unlearn that the military is the only legitimate form of national service .
We will need also to be willing to challenge those who tell us that being an artist , a pre-school teacher or ( god- forbid ) an activist , is not a respectable way to earn a living  or to serve ones country .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
And while were un-learning things , maybe we should reconsider the US military budget .
By most estimates , maintaining the warfare state now consumes 54 % of every federal tax dollar .
Without first challenging that , we might as well kiss off any chances of ever seeing a  Clean Energy Economy  or , for that matter , anything resembling a future worth living .
But first well have to rid ourselves and our children of the idea that a culture rooted in killing and consuming can also be sustainable . 
Maybe then wed have a real war tax revolution .
Since the turn of the century , a growing number of high - ranking military officers are questioning the wisdom of  and the motivation behind  the US warfare state .
In an open letter dated July 8 , 2004 , Special Forces Vet Stan Goff wrote to US military troops in Iraq :
 The big bosses are trying to gain control of the world ’s energy supplies to twist the arms of future economic competitors .
That ’s what ’s going on , and you need to understand it , then do what you need to do to hold on to your humanity .
Your so - called civilian leadership sees you as an expendable commodity .
They do n’t care about your nightmares , about the DU that you are breathing , about the loneliness , the doubts , the pain , or about how your humanity is stripped away a piece at a time .
They will cut your benefits , deny your illnesses , and hide your wounded and dead from the public .
They already are .
They do n’t care .
So you have to .
And to preserve your own humanity , you must recognize the humanity of the people whose nation you now occupy and know that both you and they are victims of the filthy rich bastards who are calling the shots . "
Humanity has passed the tipping point  economically , culturally and environmentally .
The consuming and killing  model embraced by Americans as cultural norm is , in reality , a cultural aberration .
It is destroying everything and everyone in its wake  including those who are fighting and dying to preserve it .
In accepting such a model  often without question 
Americans have become victims of their own complacency .
The price of such acquiescence may be our humanity .

With much of his time and energy being consumed by the enormous challenges of rebuilding the American economy and fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , President Obama is discovering that Washington may be constrained in its ability to engage in unilateral peacemaking in the Holy Land .
Indeed , the erosion in US global power in the aftermath of the Bush administration 's military and diplomatic mis-steps , coupled with the dramatic loss of American economic status , demonstrates the need for Washington to invite another group of players , the Europeans , to share more of the diplomatic and military burden of Middle East peace processing .
To put it bluntly , Washington should try to end the EU 's free - riding on American policy in the region , a system under which the Europeans benefit from the US political - military role , including its responsibility for pressing the Israelis and the Palestinians to make peace , while distancing themselves from the aspects of American policy that run contrary to their interests .
In fact , the EU 's interests are even more exposed than those of America to political instability in the Middle East , Europe 's strategic backyard .
The region is not only the source of 40 % of the EU 's oil imports ( compared to less than 20 % of US oil imports ) – if and when Iran arms itself with nuclear weapons , its missiles would be able to strike Paris and Rome before they could reach New York and Washington .
Hence , a failure to resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict poses more of a direct threat to the Europeans than to the Americans .
By offering Israel and Palestine an incentive to make peace in the form of eventual membership in the EU , Europe could proactively help to reverse current negative trends .
The EU is already the most important trading partner and source of capital to Israel and the Palestinian Authority , which are also members of the Euro - Mediterranean Partnership , aka Barcelona Process , which the EU launched in 1995 as part of an effort to strengthen its relations with the countries in the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa .
In 2008 , the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , tried to energise the Barcelona Process by initiating the formation of a Union for the Mediterranean , bringing together EU members with non-EU countries that border the Mediterranean , including Israel and the PA .
These two interconnected forums could help facilitate an activist European diplomacy to be pursued together with US initiatives to resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The EU strategy should involve more than just the application of its " soft power " , in the form of economic and other non-military assistance .
In fact , the EU would be in a position to use its evolving combined military force to serve in peacekeeping operations along the borders between Israel and Palestine .
But the main European contribution to inducing the two sides to make peace – and to eventually sustain it – would be the offer of EU membership to Israel and Palestine .
Joining the EU would not only fulfil the deepest economic , cultural and political aspirations of many Israelis and Palestinians , it would also provide a framework for economic co-operation between the two intertwined states as well as laws , rules and norms of behaviour that would protect both from succumbing to their worst instincts .
Indeed , the process of accession into the EU would help tip the balance of power among both Israelis and Palestinians in the direction of the more westernised and secular elements in both societies .
In a way , turning towards Europe would complete an historical cycle for both the Zionism that gave birth to Israel and the Arab nationalist opposition it ignited .
If European antisemitism and imperialism helped set the stage for the current conflict in Israel / Palestine , there is an element of historical justice in having Europe play a central role in resolving the clash between Zionism and Arab nationalism .
For the Israelis , a diplomatic package deal that reinforces the benefits of peace with the Palestinians through membership in the EU would help end Israel 's unhealthy dependence on the US .
Conditioning Israel 's entry into the EU on its agreement to withdraw from the occupied territories and dismantle the Jewish settlements there would strengthen the hands of those Israelis who envision their state not as a militarised Jewish ghetto but as a normal state and a liberal and economically prosperous community .
For the Palestinians , the choice is between the vision of peace with Israel as part of a partnership with the EU , of a Palestine as a Middle Eastern Hong Kong , as opposed to the alternative of continuing Israeli occupation and the growing power of radical Islamist forces .
A new Palestinian leadership working with the EU would have to pursue a reform - orientated programme as part of negotiations on accession .
This would involve the economic reconstruction of the West Bank and Gaza through investment and aid and the creation of Palestinian - Israeli - EU business partnerships .
In the same way that the establishment of Nafta produced pressure for reforms in Mexico , the evolution of trade and institutional ties between the EU , Israel , and eventually Jordan , Syria , and Lebanon , could lay the foundations for movement towards peace and economic and political change in the entire Levant .
A key benefit of stronger institutional ties between the EU , Israel , Palestine and neighbouring countries would be a stronger framework for the protection of minority rights .
Israel risks becoming an apartheid state with pariah status abroad unless it can find a way to provide its non-Jewish citizens with full civil , political and economic rights .
Conversely it will be difficult for the Palestinians to realise the benefits of peaceful co-existence with Israel unless Jews can live and work in a new Palestinian state without fear for their safety or property .
Integration of both Israel and Palestine into the EU framework , including EU rules with respect to the protection of minority rights , would make these requirements much easier to fulfil .
Many Americans might resent the idea of losing their dominant role in the peace process .
But the non-strategy pursued by several US administrations and based on the notion that the Americans do the driving in the Middle East while asking the Europeans to change the oil and check the tyres has become unfeasible , which explains why Obama needs to ask the Europeans to start taking an active part – and do some driving – in steering an effort to bring peace to the Middle East .

Most men have probably had a fantasy or two about pulling off a “ once in a lifetime ” kind of heist worth millions .
Fortunately , most of us are sane enough not to let it get further than a thought .
Below are a few men who were not .
The only criteria for entry on this list is that they must have gotten away with it , at least temporarily .
Anyone caught in the act does not qualify for this list .
Whether it be cash , jewels , art or anything else worth big bucks , you can bet there is someone , somewhere , planning on stealing it .
All values are in US $ or UK £ , which bear in mind , are worth more than US dollars .
I have roughly adjusted for inflation of some of the older robberies to show where they compare to some of the modern monster hauls .
Incredibly , no one was killed during any of the below robberies ( as far as I can tell ) , the mark of true professionals .
Feel free to add any others I may have missed in the comments section .
This list was originally sent in as a top 20 , but it has been broken up due to the size of the items – the second installment will appear in the future .
10 Harry Winston 5th December 2008 - Paris , France : $ 108 million
Four armed men entered the upmarket jewelry store ( “ Jeweler to the Stars ” ) shortly before closing time , 3 of whom were dressed in wigs and women ’s clothing .
After cleaning out the display cases , they forced staff to loot the storage area , as the millions worth of jewels in the display cases just was n’t enough for these guys .
They cleaned the place out , without firing a shot .
Harry Winston stock fell 9 % the next day after word of the robbery got out .
The store had been robbed the previous year , where thieves netted 10 million euros worth of jewels .
One would think that perhaps it would be cheaper hiring some armed guards than getting robbed on a yearly basis .
25 people have since been arrested for the crime , aged 22 to 67 .
Good to see there is no age discrimination among thieves .
9 Antwerp Diamond Center 16th February 2003 - Belgium : $ 100 million +
80 % of the world ’s uncut diamonds go through Antwerp , and do n’t thieves know it !
The city has seen its fair share of heists , but this one was incredible in both dollar value and the method with which it was executed .
This haul was so large that the thieves literally could n’t carry all their booty out of the vault , but still managed to empty an impressive 123 of 189 deposit boxes .
Leonardo Notarbartolo , a 30 year career thief , was the leader of this stylish gang .
The robbery was years in the making , with at least 4 people involved .
They had rented office space in the building 3 years earlier , where Leonardo posed as an Italian diamond merchant to gain trust and credibility .
He set up meetings and did small deals , no one ever suspecting a thing .
When it was finally time to move , they inserted fake tapes into the security cameras to cover their movements .
The vault was protected by 10 layers of security , including infrared heat detectors , Doppler radar , a magnetic field , a seismic sensor , and a lock with 100 million possible combinations .
The robbery was called the heist of the century , and even now the police ca n’t explain exactly how it was done .
Notarbartolo was caught after one of his accomplices failed to burn a garbage bag of evidence .
The $ 100 million worth of gems has never been found and Notarbartolo is currently serving a 10 year sentence .
Interestingly , Notarbartolo has claimed that a Jewish diamond merchant hired them for the heist and that they actually only stole roughly $ 20 million worth , with many of the deposit boxes already lying empty .
He believes that he and his gang were used as part of a huge insurance fraud .
Police have denied this possibility .
To read his version of events , outlining how they did it , go here .
8 United California Bank Robbery 24th March 1972 - USA : $ 30 million est .
Whilst $ 30 million may not seem like much compared to the other monsters on this list , bear in mind that this occurred back in 1972 .
By today ’s standards , it would be worth more than $ 100 million .
At the time , it was a world record amount .
A group of 7 men from Ohio , led by Amil Dinsio , broke into a branch of the United California Bank in Laguna Niguel , California , and looted the safe deposit vault .
Due to the nature of safe deposit boxes and their undeclared contents , only an estimate is possible .
They were eventually apprehended by the FBI .
One of the men involved , Phil Christopher , has written an account of the robbery in the book Superthief .
I could n’t dig up too much information on this robbery , as even the FBI website does not have an account of the robbery or investigation , so if anyone wishes to add more information in the comments , feel free .
7 Schiphol Airport Heist 25th February 2005 - Amsterdam : $ 118 million est .
This haul is the largest diamond heist in history .
$ 118 million is the estimate , as many of the stones were uncut , which make them much harder to value ( and trace . )
Whilst many of the other robberies on this list involve elegant planning and flawless execution , this was more akin to a smash and grab .
2 weeks prior to the robbery , 4 men stole a KLM cargo truck and KLM uniforms to divert suspicion until the last moment , so that they could move around the secure areas of the airport unhindered .
( KLM is a major Dutch airline . )
On February 25th , the thieves drove right up to a KLM truck that was carrying a large haul of uncut diamonds intended for delivery to Antwerp .
In full view of many witnesses , they ordered the drivers out at gun-point and simply got in the truck and drove it away .
Due to the fact that they knew exactly which truck to target , police suspect an inside job .
It was the second time in 6 months that the airport terminal had been breached .
Several men have been arrested in connection to the robbery .
6 British Bank of the Middle East 20th January , 1976 - Beirut , Lebanon : £ 25 million
The 1970s saw the rise of the PLO , a terrorist group led by Yasser Arafat , whose aim was to carve out a homeland for the Palestinian people .
They were at war .
And wars cost money .
Lots of it .
Lebanon was in the midst of a civil war , and amid the chaos , a group associated with the PLO broke into a dozen banks , the largest of which was the British Bank of the Middle East .
The group made off with a staggering £ 25 million worth of gold , jewels , stocks and currency , valued at much more than $ 100 million in today ’s money .
The group blasted the wall of the bank that was shared with the Catholic Church next door .
With the assistance of Corsican locksmiths , they opened the vault and plundered the contents over the course of 2 days .
Some of the stocks were later sold back to their owners .
5 Knightsbridge Security Deposit 12th July 1987 - UK : £ 60 million
Valerio Viccei migrated to the UK from Italy in 1986 , where he was wanted for over 50 armed robberies .
He decided to continue his successful trade in his new homeland , where he and an accomplice entered the Knightsbridge Safe Deposit Centre and asked to rent a Safe Deposit Box .
After being led into the vault , they subdued the manager and the guards .
Valerio hung a sign outside stating that the Deposit was temporarily closed to deter more customers , and then went about letting in more accomplices .
The gang then plundered the safe deposit boxes at will and netted an estimated £ 60 million , which translates approximately into a whopping $ 174 million in today ’s money .
The police were not alerted until an hour after the robbery , giving the team plenty of time to flee the scene .
Valerio fled to Latin America whilst his accomplices were arrested , then foolishly returned to England sometime later to retrieve his beloved Ferrari , where he was subsequently caught .
He was sentenced to 22 years in prison .
One would think that with the better part of $ 174 million , you would just buy another Ferrari .
Or two .
He was killed in 2000 while on day release in Italy , as a result of a gunfight with police .
4 Baghdad Bank Robbery 12th July 2007 - Baghdad , Iraq : $ 282 million
Employees of the Dar Es Salaam bank showed up to work one morning to find that the doors were unlocked , the vault open , and all the money was gone .
It is believed that 3 guards at the bank made off with a staggering $ 282 million in this whopping haul .
Yes , more than a quarter of a billion dollars !
That ’s more money than the entire economies of some small countries .
It is unclear why the bank had such a large amount of cash on hand , but it was all in US currency .
It is suspected that the guards had the assistance of militias , to avoid detection at security checkpoints around Baghdad , as having a lazy $ 282 million in the boot of your car might raise suspicions .
No one has been brought to justice for this brazen crime and none of the money has been recovered .
The robbery received surprisingly little media coverage .
3 Boston Museum 18th March 1990 - Boston , USA : $ 300 million
Number 3 on our list is also considered the biggest art heist in history .
Two men dressed as police officers convinced 2 inexperienced security guards at the Gardner Museum that they were responding to a disturbance .
Contrary to museum policy , the 2 guards let the “ officers ” into the premises , where they quickly learned that they had been duped after being handcuffed by the men in the basement .
Amazingly , the 2 men managed to do this despite having no visible weapons whatsoever .
The men spent the next 81 minutes calmly selecting 12 pieces of art with a combined value of over $ 300 million , and this was 20 years ago .
Among the paintings stolen were 3 Rembrandt ’s and a Vermeer .
The two then took the surveillance tapes and departed , never to be heard from again , though in 1994 an offer was made to return the paintings for $ 2.6 million and immunity from prosecution , but the writer was never heard from again .
The men appear to possibly be amateurs , as they made no effort to avoid damaging the paintings and left even more valuable works behind .
The case has never been solved and there is a $ 5 million reward for any information pertaining to the return of the artworks .
Also , authorities have announced that they will not prosecute anyone who has the paintings and offers to return them .
More on the details of this interesting robbery can be read here .
2 City Bonds Robbery 2nd May 1990 - London , UK : £ 292 million
John Goddard was a 58 year old messenger working for broker Sheppards , who was mugged whilst carrying a briefcase on a quiet London side street .
However , the contents of that briefcase contained £ 292 million in bearer bonds .
Goddard was delivering Bank of England Treasury bills from banks and building societies .
Due to the nature of bearer bonds , whoever is carrying them is deemed the owner .
They are as good as cash .
He was held at knifepoint , whilst his assailant made off with 301 Treasury bills , most valued at £ 1 million each .
Keith Cheeseman was arrested in connection to the crime and received a 6 and a half year sentence .
Police believe that the mugging was carried out by Patrick Thomas , but he was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head before he could be charged .
All but 2 of the bonds were recovered after police and the FBI infiltrated the gang responsible .
It ’s amazing that the second largest robbery in history was carried out by a low level thief brandishing only a knife on an insignificant back street .
1 Central Bank of Iraq 18th March 2003 - Baghdad , Iraq : $ 1 billion
Some robberies require careful planning .
Others use brute force .
But the largest in history was as simple was it was effective .
Saddam Hussein treated Iraq as his own personal fiefdom , so it ’s no surprise that he would feel that the Central Bank of Iraq was his personal bank account .
The day before Coalition forces began bombing Iraq , he sent his son Qusay to make a withdrawal on his behalf with a handwritten note .
Qusay oversaw the withdrawal of boxes stuffed with $ 100 bills in a five - hour operation which netted the dictator about $ 1 billion in US dollars .
It did n’t get him very far , as he was caught sometime later hiding in a hole in the ground whilst his son was killed by US forces .
Approximately $ 650 million was later found by US troops hidden in the walls of one of his palace ’s , though the remaining $ 350 million has never been recovered and is considered lost .
ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian man who argued with his son over Sony PlayStation tactics was recovering in hospital on Monday after the teenager stabbed him in the neck with a 15 - inch kitchen knife , police and hospital officials said .
The man , identified as Fabrizio R. , suffered a deep cut to the throat after his 16 - year - old son , Mario , attacked him during an argument on Sunday over the soccer video game FIFA 2009 .
Police said the argument broke out when the 46 - year - old storekeeper offered his son advice on tactics to improve his play , and then turned the television off in response to his son ’s behavior .
Fetching a knife from the kitchen , Mario stabbed his father in the neck before returning to clean the weapon at the kitchen sink in front of his mother and leaving it to dry on the draining - board .
Forty - six year - old housewife Monica B , . told Italian daily Il Corriere della Sera that she had no idea what had happened until her husband stumbled into the room , clutching his throat .
“ I saw Mario come back into the room , he seemed calm , he went to the sink and I noticed him washing a knife , ” Monica told the newspaper .
“ Then my husband came into the room with a hand round his neck , dripping blood . ”
The teenager shut himself in his bedroom after the attack and made no attempt to resist arrest , police said .
The game had been given to Mario a few days earlier , as a birthday present .
“ Mario is obsessed .
He ’s forever playing on his PlayStation , and we bought him FIFA 2009 because we did n’t want him playing violent games , ” his mother told Il Corriere .

Advertisement Walking my collie , Bear , through the catacombs in Exeter one morning , I noticed a man sitting on one of the tombs looking out over the Exe Valley .
He was thoughtful and judging by his appearance , he could have just come out of the woods : weather - beaten , wearing a red and black lumber jacket , muddy jeans and sturdy black boots .
In all honesty I would probably have just passed the time of day had our dogs not decided to play .
An hour passed in conversation before I had realised the time .
He told me his name was Eddie Craven , an ex-serviceman with post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and that he was living in a tent in the woods .
The stories of his life came thick and fast - some harrowing , some inspiring and all worth listening to .
He served in Bosnia during Operation Grapple in 1994 -'95 .
During that time , British Forces provided a relief effort for civilians living in the war - torn country .

When he left the army soon after , the images of death and violence haunted him to the point where he could no longer live an ordinary life .
Anger often gave way to violence and fuelled by drink , he found his life and relationships falling apart .
What struck me most about this man was that despite his situation , he somehow succeeded in finding the strength to help others in a similar position , extending the hand of friendship where he could .
Homeless now .... for a while he sold the big issue .
It was during this time he met another ex-serviceman who bought a magazine and enquired further about how Eddie came to be where he was .
This encounter sparked Eddie 's interest in the Warrior Programme .
He had been offered help before from , among others , the Royal British Legion , but the accommodation he was given proved too suburban and he ended up walking out .
He still felt unable to lead what I suppose you would describe as a normal life .
On the day I met him he told me he had built a tee - pee in a secret location in the woods .
This was where he lived .
He gathered kindling and fallen trees to make a fire , providing warmth and a means of cooking .
There were two other people living with him , an older homeless man and a younger one who had recently been released from prison .
I asked Eddie if I could film a story about him .
Trained to kill Please turn on JavaScript .

He thought for a moment and then agreed , but he clearly was n't the type to put himself in the limelight .
Not at all .
He made it absolutely clear that his motivation was to publicise what he saw as the unaddressed problem of servicemen leaving the armed forces with no support .
I went to the woods and filmed his home and what sticks in my mind about what he said that night was : " When you join the army , they turn something on .
They train you to kill .
When you leave , they do n't turn it off .
" When I walk down the street people look at me like I am not a person .
They do n't realise I have got three medals pinned on my chest . "
That day his best chance of taking control of his life was something called the Warrior Programme .
A four day course using guided meditation , neurolinguistic programming and holistic therapies like tai chi and qui energy .
Having filmed his life in that moment , I decided to ask if I could follow his journey through the Warrior Programme .
He reluctantly agreed .
He was uncomfortable with being filmed but felt he had some degree of influence to bring the problem of PTSD among servicemen to the fore .

The time in between the first broadcast of his life in the woods , and beginning the Warrior Programme , we had very little contact .
On the first day of the Programme , I arrived with my camera and tripod at 9.30 am .
Eddie appeared about an hour later , not in the most relaxed of moods .
He told me he had almost bailed out .
When the car arrived to pick him up , he did n't want to come .
Again though , a little voice on his shoulder told him he should come , more for the greater good than personal gain .
During the next four days I saw Eddie change from a reluctant angry sceptic to a man whose face and body relaxed with the knowledge that things could be different .
He now had choices and a means to exercise those choices in his life decisions .
Through this series of films , you will see what influence the Warrior Programme has had on Eddie 's life , and others who took part .
Parts two and three of the BBC Spotlight series will be added to this page on Wednesday 9 and Thursday 10 December 2009 .

Antonio Rogerio Nogueira has withdrawn from his co-headlining light heavyweight contest against Brandon Vera at UFC 109 on Feb. 6 in Las Vegas due to injury , Sherdog.com has learned from multiple sources .
Nogueira , the brother of former UFC interim heavyweight champion Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira , suffered a fractured ankle , said both sources .
Nogueira ’s manager , Ed Soares , could not be initially reached to confirm the injury .
- Via Sherdog
This is just another huge downer .
" Lil Nog " had a major coming out with his destruction of Luiz Cane and was looking to ride that momentum into a fight with Vera .
A fractured ankle is one of those injuries that really takes time to recover from as well as any attempt to rush back can just result in re-injury .
Without knowing the extent to which it is fractured it is very hard to say how long to expect him out but this is a setback for both he and the UFC , which is going through an injury plagued period like we 've never seen in the sport .
[ Update : AA 331 did land on Runway 12 as I had guessed .
A reader pointed out that there is no ILS approach to runway 30 .
Thus it makes perfect sense that they chose the ILS to Runway 12 .
However , some people reported that the aircraft touched down nearly half way down the runway .
If true , that will undoubtedly turn out to be a contributing factor to this accident ]
At shortly before 10:30 PM last night , a landing American Airlines Boeing 737-800 , that originated at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport , overan the runway at Kingston , Jamaica 's Norman Manley International Airport .
Flight 331 reportedly crossed a road and may have ended up on a beach just short of the Caribbean .
The Jamaica Observer reported 40 injured passengers and Jamaica TV reported in a CNN video that 4 of the injuries were serious .
There were conflicting reports about whether the aircraft broke up into as many as three pieces after the accident .
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration web site , the 10 PM weather in Kinston was reported to include heavy rain showers .
The temperature was 69°F , dew point was 66 °F and the winds were out of the northwest at 13 knots .
Looking at a Google Maps satellite photo and comparing it with Jamaica TV ’s report that the aircraft overran the runway and “ crossed a road , ” suggests that the aircraft landed on runway 12 with a tailwind .
If so , the accident may turn out to be similar to a December 2005 accident at Chicago ’s Midway Airport in which a Southwest Boeing 737-700 landed downwind with a 11 knot tailwind .
It encountered poor braking action due to snow and ice on the runway and was still traveling at 53 knots as it overran the runway .
Landing with a tailwind increases landing distances .
For example , a landing distance calculator for a Boeing 737-500 indicates that when landing at 61 tons with no wind on a dry runway , 4565 feet is required .
However with poor braking action , the required landing distance increases to 8855 feet .
The only runway at Kingston ’s airport is 8786 feet long .
With a 10 knot tailwind , the landing distances increase to 5055 feet and 10,370 feet respectively .
With a 10 knot headwind , the landing distances decrease to 4435 feet and 8455 feet respectively .
While pilots are generally encouraged to land into a headwind , there are operational reasons when landing with a tailwind is preferred .
In the case of the Southwest jet , an AOPA Pilot article said “ Changing runways might have had a negative impact on operations at Chicago O’Hare International , 13 nm to the northwest , so the air traffic considerations must be weighed against the safety implications . ”
It ’s less clear that there were any compelling reasons why American Airlines flight 331 had to make a downwind landing .
If the pilots did choose to land with a tailwind , more than likely they did so because they wanted to decrease their taxi time to the terminal .
Had they landed with a headwind on runway 30 , they would have had to taxi more than a mile to return to the terminal .
By landing on runway 12 , they would have rolled out next to the terminal , saving several minutes of taxi time .
If the pilots did make a downwind landing onto runway 12 , then another subtle factor may have played a role : Flight 331 was running late .
The flight stops in Miami before continuing on to Jamaica and according to American Airlines online schedule , Flight 331 departs at Miami at 7:25 PM .
But , according to www.flightaware.com, for the last seven days , the flight departed on average at 7:46 PM .
But last night , it departed at 8:53 PM , about an hour and a half late .
Could Flight 331 ’s crew have felt pressured to save 2 - 3 minutes of taxi time because they were running late ?
Absolutely .
Would a downwind landing have mattered with a normal , dry runway ?
No , not at all .
But with heavy rains and a wet runway , the crew may have been betting that everything else would go right .
In the case of the Southwest overrun at Midway airport , a compounding factor was that the thrust reversers were not deployed until 15 seconds after touchdown ; the four airliners that landed in the 20 minutes prior all deployed their thrust reversers in 4 to 6 seconds after touchdown .
Risk management and safe flying is all about building in lots of extra margin into every decision .
It ’s reasonable to shave the margins — for example by making a downwind landing — but then it ’s important that there are no additional compounding factors .
It will be a long time before we know the full story behind exactly what happened last night at Jamaica , but one thing is certain .
Somewhere in the process , a decision or malfunction eroded the safety margins , causing this accident .
Apple took advantage of a rebounding PC market this past holiday shopping season , with the Mac maker 's U.S. sales rising 31 percent year - over - year to 1.5 million units .
That was good enough to keep its share of the domestic pie above 7 percent , despite an influx of budget netbook PCs that flooded the market .
Apple outpaced the rest of the U.S. PC market , which also grew an impressive 24 percent year - over - year during the fourth quarter ( the three - month period ending December ) , according to preliminary data released Wednesday by market research firm IDC .
Apple 's sales were enough to keep its placement as the fifth - largest domestic PC maker , behind HP , Dell , Acer and Toshiba , respectively .
In total , Apple sold an estimated 5.6 million computers in the U.S. in during the 2009 calendar year , good for an overall 8 percent share .
That 's up slightly from the 5.2 million units and 7.9 percent share the Cupertino - based company saw in 2008 , representing 8.2 percent year - over - year growth .
Apple was the fourth - largest U.S. PC maker in all of 2009 .
While Apple is growing , sales data shows that its slice of the market — as quantified by market research firms like IDC — is not .
That can be attributed to the booming market for low - end netbooks , which sell for a few hundred dollars and earn manufacturers razor - thin profit margins .
By comparison , Apple 's believed to retain some of the highest margins in the industry , often hovering above 30 percent .
" Low - cost notebooks and mini-notebooks were the biggest contributors to the successful fourth quarter , " said David Daoud , research manager with IDC's U.S. Quarterly PC tracker .
Overall PC growth during the fourth quarter was bolstered by the launch of Windows 7 , which pushed the industry to a record quarter of 20.7 million units for the three - month period .
IDC said that consumer confidence was a key factor in these advances , though business spending has lagged behind and is likely to take some more time to take hold .
" The U.S. market exploded in the 4th quarter driven by a series of factors contributing to the unexpected 24 % year - on - year growth , " Daoud said .
" First is the rubber - band effect and recovery from the year - ago quarter , which suffered from buyer contraction when the economic crisis was confirmed .
Then vendors responded with new low price points to stimulate demand and face competition . "

Global sales were also strong , with the market seeing a 15.8 percent yearly gain .
Overall , the fourth quarter of 2009 represented the first double - digit growth in PC shipments since the third quarter of 2008 , IDC said .
Of the big names , the strongest fourth quarter performance worldwide came from HP , which captured 20.7 percent of the market .
It was followed by Acer , Dell , Lenovo and Toshiba , respectively .
Acer and Dell switched places , with Dell coming in second for the entirety of 2009 , while the rest held strong to their previous rankings .
Of the top 5 , only Dell lost share in the calendar year , dropping 9.4 percent .
" The market has weathered a storm which looks to be behind us , " said Jay Chou , research analyst , Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker .
" But decreasing margins will soon become even more pertinent as one considers the long term effects of holding market share at the cost of profitability .
" Without an effective strategy to convey a clear usage model and feature set tied to each segment , the market will inevitably continue down the slippery slope of ' good - enough ' computing sold to the lowest bidder . "

Apple 's modest volume shipments compared to its larger rivals have continually placed the company outside the rankings of the top five global PC makers .
Market research firms like IDC therefore fail to report how the Mac maker stacks up against its peers on a global scale .
Gartner
Also Wednesday , IDC rival Gartner released preliminary results for the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 .
Gartner also found Apple to be the fifth - largest U.S. PC vendor , with a 7.5 percent share for the three month frame .
Apple shipped an estimated 1.5 million units in the fourth quarter , a 23.3 percent increase from the same period in 2008 .
But Apple 's yearly market share slipped 200 basis points , from 7.7 percent at the end of 2008 .
Gartner found overall PC shipments increased 26.5 percent year over year , totaling 19.8 million for the December quarter .
The top PC manufacturer was HP , with a 30 percent market share , followed by Dell , Acer and Toshiba , respectively .
" Shipment growth was largely driven by low - priced consumer mobile PCs , both in regular notebooks and mini-notebooks , " said Mikako Kitagawa , principal analyst with Gartner .
" As economic weakness continued , buyers became extremely price sensitive .
Low - priced PCs were good enough for many average consumers . "
Acer in particular was driven higher by its sub -$ 500 netbooks .
The company saw a 48.4 increase in U.S. sales , and a 41.5 boost worldwide in the fourth quarter .
Gartner noted that the increased share may not , however , be a sustainable business .
" Aggressive promotion by PC vendors and channels stimulated consumer PC demand , " Kitagawa said .
" However , some vendors made damaging price cuts to increase market share . "
Gartner said HP moved past Dell based on more competitive pricing and successful team - ups with large retailers .
Dell also could n't compete in the price battle , and has had continued weakness in the enterprise market .

Vendor Unit Shipment Estimates for 4Q09 ( Thousands of Units ) | Source : Gartner
Globally , total unit sales increased 22.1 percent year over year to a total of 90 million .
Capturing the top spot was HP , with 17.8 million units shipped , securing the company a 19.8 percent market share .
They were followed , in order , by Acer , Dell , Lenovo and Toshiba .
Total worldwide PC shipments in 2009 were 306 million , which was a 5.2 percent increase from 2008 .
The mobile PC market held the highest average selling prices as HP was the year 's top global vendor with 58.9 million units sold .
It is important to consider financial decisions in light of your credit record .
This is because this record can be used in a lot of ways and you can be severely judged if it does not look good .
Therefore , it is worth knowing exactly what it is and whether a payday loan will have an effect on it .
What is a credit record ?
You credit record is an account of some details of your finances which potential lenders and others will use to make decisions .
For example , it will include details such as what regular bill payments you are responsible for , any loans that you have outstanding and any CCJ ’s and outstanding loan payments that you have .
It is used to decide on whether you can take out loans as lenders want to see whether you are likely to be able to repay them .
Potential landlords may also use them to decide whether they want to take on tenants as they will want to check they are capable of paying the rent .
There are a few jobs , such as working for the government , where they may want to check your credit record as well .
You can check your own record by using several different companies .
It can be wise to make sure that the information on it is correct as you may be being unfairly judged otherwise .
What looks good and bad on a credit record ?
This is a trickier thing to address .
Lenders will have different criteria when looking at a credit record and so there is really no such thing as a perfect one .
For example , some may want you to have made all of your bill and loan repayments on time whereas others may not mind that you have missed a few as they may be happy to have the opportunity to be able to charge you some extra fees from time to time .
However , they are unlikely to take on someone who has missed lots of repayments or had other big financial problems particularly CCJ’s .
If you have no regular payments ( so no rent , utility bills , phone contracts etc ) and have no loans , then lenders will not know whether you are going to be reliable at repaying .
Therefore , if you are in a situation where you name could be added to bills , perhaps if you are in a house share , partners or something where others have names on bills , then getting your name added could help .
However , you do not want to associate yourself with someone who has a poor credit record as this could act against you .
Being self - employed or having a low or irregular salary can also go against you .
Obviously , lenders want to see that you have a stable income so that you will be able to repay the loan .
Will a payday loan harm it ?
A payday is difficult .
It is a loan that people often take out if they cannot borrow elsewhere due to having a poor credit record .
If this is the case and you take out the loan and repay it on tie then it could work in your favour as it will show that you are capable of being responsible .
However , lenders may see a no credit loan as a sign that other lenders feel you are a risk to lend to and it might just put them off regardless of whether you have been able to repay it .
It is very tricky to get into the heads of potential lenders , landlords etc .
The best thing that you can do is to only take out a loan when you really need it and when you are confident that you can repay it in full , when or before required .
Taking a risk and taking on a loan when you are not sure if you can afford it could end very badly , both for you personally , your finances and your credit report .
In the same way that any unpaid debt could harm your credit report this could too .
If you have a choice between a payday loan and an alternative loan which does need a credit check , then you might be tempted to take the other , thinking that it will look better on your credit report .
If you get turned down for that loan then this will look bad on your credit report so it is wise to only apply for loans that you feel you will be accepted for .
Not repaying a loan , whether it is a payday loan or any other type will look the same in the eyes of potential lenders .
It is therefore best to take on a loan that you are confident you be able to repay .
A payday loan can be riskier because you normally have to repay the whole loan in one lump sum .
However , you may be completely confident that you will be able to afford to repay this and manage your money so that you can pay for all of your other financial commitments as well .
It is worth sitting down with your bank statements and checking this first though .
It I easy to guess and think we will be fine , but looking at the actual figures will safeguard us form making bad judgements .
After months of taking heat for their role in the economic meltdown , Goldman Sachs employees are reportedly purchasing handguns for protection against an angry public .
The New York Police Department confirms that several Goldman employees have applied for handgun permits .
Are pistol - packing bankers really in danger from a violent backlash against Wall Street bailouts and bonuses ?
( Watch a report about Goldman Sachs bankers protecting themselves with pistols )
What angry mob ? :
" Where is this torch - toting mob " the bankers dread ?
asks John Del Signore at Gothamist .
The only protesters we 've seen so far have been raging at " communist Obama . "
Maybe the bankers are just " sick " of being blamed for the recession , and are preparing to " unload on the ungrateful rabble . "
" Goldman Sachs bankers ready to open fire on mob "
There is a mob — but it 's not violent :
Actually , there have been protests against Goldman Sachs , says John Vandeventer on the Service Employees International Union website .
But the people involved are n't violent — they 're just taxpayers who want Wall Street to " stop using our money on lobbying and bonuses . "
So when the SEIU demonstrates outside Goldman 's New York office on Dec. 14 , " we wo n't need our bulletproof vests . "
" God , guns , and Goldman "
Goldman execs have reason to be afraid :
The SEIU seems to be " relishing in the idea " of the " bourgeoisie arming itself , " say LaborUnionReport bloggers at RedState , and , given the SEIU 's " thug - like " tactics , " Goldman Sachs execs are probably right to have a concern for their own safety . "
The good news is that the bankers " will be able to use taxpayer bailout money " to load up their arsenal .
" Wow !
Goldman Sachs execs arming themselves against ... the SEIU ?!? "
Scary ?
Maybe .
Funny ?
Absolutely :
The real question , asks Matt Taibbi on True / Slant , is how funny is this " on a scale of 1 to 10 " ?
It 's never good when people feel the need to arm themselves — even " rich weenies with persecution complexes " — but the idea that " these dorks " think they stand a chance against an uprising by " keeping guns in their Hamptons beach houses " is downright hilarious .

CAMBRIDGE , MASS .— It was a festive scene in the Harvard Faculty Club here on Wednesday .
Carolers in white tie were singing Christmas songs in the lobby .
University bigwigs were kicking back for the holidays and had crowded into the upstairs restaurant for lunch .
But despite all the cheer , it was a good moment to have lunch with Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff , because elsewhere world markets were hearing a much less cheerful tune .
Investors ...
Businessman is arrested in front
of wife and son ... for ‘ anti-gipsy ’
email that he did n’t even write
Paul Osmond who made a comment about a gipsy planning application
A wealthy businessman was arrested at home in front of his wife and young son over an email which council officials deemed ‘ offensive ’ to gipsies – but which he had not even written .
The email , concerning a planning appeal by a gipsy , included the phrase : ‘ It ’s the ' do as you likey ' attitude that I am against . ’
Council staff believed the email was offensive because ‘ likey ’ rhymes with the derogatory term ‘ pikey ’ .
The 45 - year - old IT boss was held in a police cell for four hours until it was established he had nothing to do with the email , which had been sent by one of his then workers , Paul Osmond .
But police had taken his DNA and later confirmed they would be holding it indefinitely .
The businessman , who has asked not to be named , was also fingerprinted in the police investigation estimated to have cost taxpayers up to £ 12,000 .
He said two uniformed officers came to his house on a Sunday afternoon and said he would be handcuffed if he did not accompany them to the police station .
His computer and other internet equipment were also seized .
The email , from a computer at his company , was sent last August to a website at Rother District Council , in East Sussex , on which the public can comment on planning applications .
It referred to an appeal by gipsy Linda Smith , who wants to keep a mobile home in an area of outstanding beauty overlooking the Battle of Hastings site .
The email also read : ‘ Get a job , get planning permission but more to the point get out of the neighbourhood . ’
The businessman , a father of two , said last night : ‘ I had a sense of total disbelief .
My wife and I decided to tell my 11 - year - old son I had to go with the police because I had witnessed a road accident .
‘ Even though the officers were fairly pleasant to me , I was informed I would be handcuffed if I did n’t go voluntarily .
They then confiscated my computer and my wife ’s computer and took them to the police station .
‘ I was extremely angry .
I was relaxing in the comfort of my home on a Sunday afternoon and then I was in a police car under arrest – all for an innocent comment by a colleague . ’
He was driven five miles to Hastings police station .
He said : ‘ I have never had any criminal record and try my best to teach my children right from wrong .
This was a ridiculously heavy - handed police reaction to what they perceived as a racist comment .
I am not the least bit racist and neither is Paul Osmond .
The gipsy family concerned did not complain .
‘ I did nothing wrong yet ended up in a police cell for four hours with my DNA stored on a criminal database . ’
The arrest happened on November 15 and followed a three - year battle by a gipsy family to win planning permission for the mobile home on land outside the town of Battle .
The planning application concerned this gipsy home in Battle , East Sussex
The family bought a field from a farmer , put down a concrete base , and installed the mobile home at the end of a short driveway .
Rother Council issued an enforcement notice against the building .
The businessman said he also objected to the council over the location of the mobile home , which is near his property .
He said : ‘ It seems I have to get planning permission for everything I do right down to dead - heading the daffodils .
‘ It seems they can erect this home with impunity .
But I made my objections entirely through the proper channels and I have absolutely nothing against anyone in the gipsy community . ’
The case finally ended last week when Mr Osmond , who had been arrested and bailed , was told there would be no further police action .
The planning case is continuing .
Mr Osmond , 39 , of Icklesham , said : ‘ I made it clear to them I am absolutely not racist .
I said I was simply registering my objection to this application because it is 200ft from the most important and historical battlefield in the country .
' I now feel I am not even able to express an opinion for fear of being arrested by the police .
‘ One of my closest friends is an Irish traveller and he uses the term ' pikey ' all the time .
This is the ultimate in political correctness going off the scale . ’
Sussex Police said they had arrested the businessman over ‘ suspicion of committing a racial or religious - aggravated offence ’ .
After consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service , it was decided to take no further action against Mr Osmond .
Chief Inspector Heather Keating said : ‘ Sussex Police have a legal duty to promote community cohesion and tackle unlawful discrimination .
‘ We are satisfied we acted appropriately in identifying the owner of the computer used and through this , the identity of the writer of the offending line . ’
Police said they would hold the innocent men ’s DNA indefinitely , which they said was in line with national policy .
A council spokesman said : ‘ As far as we were concerned it was an offensive comment , so we got in touch with the police . ’

December 4 , 2009 --
When US President Barack Obama announced his plan to escalate the war in Afghanistan by sending 30,000 more troops to the war - torn country , he delivered on two campaign promises .
The first was a campaign trail pledge to re-focus US military power on the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
This was mostly ignored by enthralled voters .
The second was made more quietly to his many campaign donors in the defence industry .
This promise was happily recognised by war hawks throughout Washington .
The resulting troop surge into an already war - ravaged Afghanistan will lead to more of the same -- further Afghan civilian casualties , more dead US soldiers and the continuance of a military campaign in an unwinnable war .
Good news for military contractors , bad news for the rest of us .
A hawk in dove ’s clothing
Despite Obama ’s clear campaign pledges to escalate the war , he was widely perceived by voters as a peace candidate .
The hawkish claims coming from the presidential campaign of Republican John McCain provided just enough cover for Obama to cast himself as a reasonable alternative to a war - weary public .
However , once public relations turned into policy , it was clear that Obama was a war president who had no intention of crossing either military hawks or an increasingly aggressive military industrial complex .
Voters who wanted a roadmap to peace have now received an even bloodier quagmire .
Larger than this , Obama proved willing to employ arguments laid out by previous president George W. Bush .
Sure , he did not utilise Bush ’s crazy antics like announcing an “ evil - doers ” list , but Obama endorsed the key linkage that pushed the war process into motion .
Afghanistan was invaded , he confirmed , in response to the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Escalation is the logic strategy that grows from this premise .
Faced with an opportunity for a wholesale abandonment of the failed Bush - era military policy , Obama chose to defend his suitors over his voters .
First he drank the milk and now he owns the cow .
Profits and peril
For the defence industry , the announcement of the troop escalation was a positive return on a strategic investment .
The Center for Responsive Politics reports that contributions to Obama ’s campaign of more than US $ 1 million nearly doubled those made to the seemingly more friendly McCain campaign .
No surprise , since weapons makers have grown fat on military contracts , and there are now more military contractors in Afghanistan than soldiers .
Occupation has meant profiteering and these war profits have been reinvested in order to shape electoral politics and military policy in the US .
No wonder that the occupation of Afghanistan has lasted twice as long as the US military ’s involvement in World War II .
It ’s big business .
For Afghans , the consequences of schemes hatched in far - off Washington D.C. have been devastating .
A flourishing narco-economy in the countryside offers the only option for a population faced with an average life expectancy of 48 years of age .
Politically , Afghans are squeezed between the military aggression of US - directed NATO forces and the reactionary politics of the Taliban .
The US client government of Hamid Karzai offers no alternative .
Karzai rigged the most recent election and has helped to create a thoroughly corrupt state and government that has little authority outside of the capital city of Kabul .
In short , nearly all parts of the US / NATO occupation have broken down in Afghanistan .
A domestic quagmire
There is also the US domestic context to Obama ’s escalation announcement .
Throughout the United States , essential services such as education , transportation and food assistance are being cut as state and local governments attempt to close budget deficits that stem from the economic crisis .
The occupation of Afghanistan costs $ 3.6 billion per month .
All of these funds could be redirected to meet social needs domestically and to make reparation payments to the Afghan people .
Instead , they are allocated to wasteful military adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan , whose sole purpose is the projection of US military power in the region .
People in the United States will see no positive outcomes from the continued militarisation of the Middle East .
Just more killing , carried out in their name and more tax dollars carried off by the defence industry .
Bringing the war home
Less examined , yet certainly another domestic factor to consider , is the human cost of the war in terms of US soldiers .
In many , sometimes subtle , ways returning and deployed soldiers are bringing the war home .
As pawns in the larger game of the global projection of US power , they are first ripped from the social fabric in the US and then swiftly discarded after they outlast their utility .
Our society is left to deal with the consequences .
This was made clear recently when the military attempted to deploy Spc. Alexis Hutchinson despite the fact that she had no caregiver for her 11 - month - old child , Kamani .
When the military recommended foster care , Hutchinson refused to deploy and was jailed .
Perhaps Hutchinson ’s refusal was not only based on defending the safety of her child , but a recognised desire to avoid the fate of many returning veterans who face a disproportionate amount of substance abuse , homelessness and suicide .
Time to act
In his escalation speech , Obama smoothly slid into Bush - logic .
Escalating the war , he argued , was all part of a larger plan to remove the troops .
Even a grade school student can appreciate the flaw in such a proposition .
However , the politics of war and peace are not a game of logic .
Human lives are on the line .
The lives of innocent Afghans , the lives of soldiers and their families and the lives of people living here in the US who are deprived of necessary social programs in order to fund this war .

When it comes to clever coding , there ’s a fine line between amazingly brilliant and incredibly stupid .
Take DocumentDotWrite.js , for example .
It 's a single - line JavaScript file that ’s served ( http://rmd.atdmt.com/tl/DocumentDotWrite.js) seemingly all the time by Microsoft ’s Atlas advertising platform .
function DocumentDotWrite(s ) {document.write(s ) ;}
I want to believe that there ’ some Ninja JavaScript - fu going on here that my feeble mind cannot possible understand .
The Daily WTF 's own forums , which seems to be the only place on the ‘ net where this code has been discussed , conclude that it ’s a callback function for a poor man ’s bind ( ) … or some sort of ad - block / filter busting code … or even a “ coding by phone ” that was taken a bit too literally .
I guess we ’ll never know .
Like so many instances clever coding , until we hear from the actual developer behind DocumentDotWrite.js , we can only guess as to whether it ’s a complete WTF or an amazing hack .
Peter , on the other hand , did n’t have to guess .
When he saw a a bit of seemingly clever code , he was fortunte to have the original developer — and team lead — in the cubicle next to his .
This was the code he had uncovered .

Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) -- Demonstrators shouting " Death to the dictator " clashed with police in Iran on Monday as students took to the streets to mark a key national anniversary , witnesses said .
At least two clashes occurred at Revolution Square , where police attacked demonstrators with batons and chased them onto side streets , witnesses said .
A large number of security forces ringed Tehran University , where the gates were shut and large crowds inside also chanted " Death to the dictator , " the witnesses reported .
Pro-government crowds also inside the university chanted slogans and waved the flag of the Islamic Republic , witnesses said .
The witnesses asked not to be identified out of concerns for security .
CNN could not independently verify the reports .
The Iranian government did not allow members of the international media witness any possible protests this week .
The state - operated Press TV acknowledged the protests .
" A number of anti-government protesters attempted to hijack the occasion to hold rallies in Tehran .
Their efforts were foiled by the presence of security forces which are deployed in several parts of the capital , " an anchor said while the station showed images of pro-government demonstrations .
The demonstrations are being held on Student Day , an annual observance when Tehran extolls the virtues of the Islamic Revolution .
The holiday commemorates three university students killed in 1953 by security forces of the Western - backed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the shah of Iran .
He was toppled from power during the revolution two decades later .
The students this year are demonstrating against the disputed June 12 presidential election .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner in what protesters say was a rigged election .
The election result was met with nationwide protests and the imprisonment of hundreds of demonstrators .
Allegations of torture , rape and other abuses have since emerged .
Ongoing prosecutions of protesters have resulted in death sentences for some .
Since the election , other key anniversaries have met with protests against the current leadership .
Protesters and police clashed November 4 , the anniversary of the 1979 siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iran .
In September , demonstrators took to the streets in protest on Quds Day , an annual event that is meant to show Iran 's solidarity with Palestinians .
On Monday , police manned major intersections .
Shopkeepers , fearing violence , shuttered storefronts .
As the protests got under way , Iranian security and paramilitary forces tear - gassed , beat and arrested students on university campuses , said a group called the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .
According to the human rights organization , protests have taken place at the following universities in Tehran : Amir Kabir , Tehran , Sharif , Elm va Sanaat , Honar , Tehran Markaz , Sureh , and Tehran Shomal .
Protests also have taken place at universities in Isfahan , Kermanshah , Shiraz , Mashhad and Tabriz , and at Agricultural University of Karaj , the rights group said .
Security forces fired plastic bullets at students and protesters outside the Amir Kabir campus , said the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .
The organization 's reports could not be independently verified .
In central Tehran , plumes of smoke rose from a large garbage bin that had been set on fire , witnesses told CNN .

Ex-spy chief Sir John Scarlett has told the Iraq war inquiry there was " no conscious intention " to manipulate information about Iraq 's weapons .
He denied being under pressure to " firm up " the September 2002 dossier which contained the claim Iraq could use WMD within 45 minutes of Saddam 's order .
But he said it would have been " better " to have made clear it referred to battlefield munitions not missiles .
He was not asked about an MP 's claim a taxi driver was the claim 's source .
Tory MP Adam Holloway published a report on Tuesday saying advice casting doubt on the 45 - minute claim was " ignored " , but Sir John was not asked about this .
The infamous September 2002 dossier included the now discredited claim that Iraq could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order being given .
It was at the heart of the row between the government and the BBC which culminated in the death of government weapons expert Dr David Kelly .
Sir John , who was in charge of the dossier , said it was produced in good faith : " There was absolutely no conscious intention to manipulate the language or to obfuscate or to create a misunderstanding as to what this might refer to . "
Intelligence Sir John , who until recently was head of MI6 , was chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee when it produced the controversial dossier spelling out the case for military action against Iraq .
Sir John defended the dossier but said it should have stated the 45 - minute claim referred to battlefield munitions not ballistic missiles to avoid the information " getting lost in translation " .
AT THE INQUIRY BBC World Affairs correspondent Peter Biles
The evidence presented by Sir John Scarlett was keenly awaited .
Unusually , every seat in the public gallery was occupied today .
The former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee was driven discreetly into the QEII Conference Centre through a side entrance .
Inside the inquiry room , there were to be no startling revelations .
Sir John reinforced the point that intelligence from Saddam Hussein 's Iraq was limited and " very difficult " to obtain .
He firmly rejected the suggestion that there had been pressure to firm up the language in the controversial 2002 dossier on WMD .
He went some way to distance himself from Tony Blair 's foreword .
Sir John said he had made small corrections , but he insisted it had been Mr Blair 's wording .
There is the intriguing prospect of more evidence being given by Sir John at future sessions , although the chairman of the inquiry , Sir John Chilcot , made clear this evidence would be heard in private .
During the 90 minute hearing he was not asked about where the 45 minute claim intelligence came from - although inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot said at the end of the session the ex-spy chief would be giving evidence again behind closed doors .
Sir John Scarlett also told the inquiry that , on 19 March 2003 - the day before the invasion - the Joint Intelligence Committee discussed intelligence suggesting Iraq had disassembled its chemical weapons capability and might find it " difficult " to reconstitute it .
However , he said this was not new information and the committee did not revise its view that Iraq did possess chemical and biological weapons and had the capacity to use them in battlefield munitions .
He said that the prime minister and other ministers were informed of its conclusions .
Discussing the general reliability of intelligence ahead of the war , he said the nature of Iraqi society - where policy revolved around the " whims and personality " of Saddam Hussein - meant it was difficult to produce intelligence , particular about secretive weapons programmes .
He said all intelligence sources , particularly those from opposition and exile groups , were treated with " caution " .
He said " significant " assessments in August and September 2002 suggested Saddam was accelerating both his biological and chemical weapons programmes and had " intent " to use them if attacked - reports that continued to influence JIC thinking in the run-up to war .
' Political wind '
Ahead of Sir John 's appearance a Commons Defence Committee member , Tory MP Adam Holloway claimed military advice was matched to the " prevailing political wind " in the run-up to the invasion .
Mr Holloway , the MP for Gravesham and a former officer in the Grenadier Guards , published his paper The Failure of British Political and Military Leadership through First Defence , the centre - right think - tank he chairs .
The cursory level of questioning undertaken in public - and the announcement that further appearances will be behind closed doors - is deeply disappointing .

Iraq Inquiry : Day - by - day timeline Army chief ' told of US Iraq aims '
Iraq details ' scanty ' before war In it , he said the 45 - minute claim arose because British intelligence was " squeezing " agents in Iraq for information , under pressure from Downing Street to back up its case that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
" The provenance of this information was never questioned in detail until after the Iraq invasion , when it became apparent that something was wrong , " he said .
" In the end it turned out that the information was not credible , it had originated from an emigre taxi driver on the Iraqi - Jordanian border , who had remembered an overheard conversation in the back of his cab a full two years earlier . "
Mr Holloway stated that an intelligence analyst had at the time flagged up - via a footnote - that the claims were " demonstrably untrue " .
" Despite this glaring factual inaccuracy ... the report was characterised as reliable , " he said .
The government has yet to respond to his claims .
The inquiry chairman said it would deal with the MP 's claim where " relevant " in the inquiry but it was not specifically a " matter " for Tuesday 's inquiry hearing .
' Caveats removed '
The row between the BBC and the government came after a report suggesting the dossier had been " sexed up " by Downing Street against the wishes of the intelligence services and that the 45 - minute claim was included even though the government " probably knew " it was wrong .
Despite this glaring factual inaccuracy ... the report was characterised as reliable

Timeline : The 45 - minute claim At - a - glance : Butler report The Hutton Inquiry into the death of the BBC 's source - Dr David Kelly - ruled that the BBC report 's claims were " unfounded " because the 45 minute claim was based on a report which the Secret Intelligence Service " regarded as reliable " .
It was not until the following year 's Butler inquiry into intelligence about Iraq 's weapons capability in 2004 that it emerged that the 45 - minute claim had come " third - hand " , through an established source and a second link in the reporting chain from the original Iraqi military source .
Lord Butler concluded the limitations of the intelligence were not " made sufficiently clear " , that important caveats had been removed and that the 45 minutes claim was " unsubstantiated " and should not have been included without clarification .
The then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told MPs that MI6 had withdrawn the claim in October 2004 .
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey said Sir John Scarlett 's evidence " stretches credibility " .
He added : " The cursory level of questioning undertaken in public - and the announcement that further appearances will be behind closed doors - is deeply disappointing .
It looks like the Chilcot Inquiry may have failed its first test on transparency . "

Canadian designer Nicko Björn Elliott has completed a child 's play house wrapped around a tree in Toronto .
The wooden structure is supported on pillars above an S - shaped bench at the base of the tree and features a pole for the children to slide down .
Shaded by the branches above , it is clad in translucent fibreglass .
Photographs are by Jesse Colin Jackson .
Here 's some more information from Nicko Björn Elliott :
--
Eight year - old Jorin and his big sister Matana , ten , sought a tree fort refuge on their downtown Toronto property to evoke the pleasures of cottage country during busy summers in the city .
Rather than being constructed on the tree , the project wraps itself around the mature pine tree and is supported on three pilotis above an S - shaped bench that skirts around the columns , tree trunk and slide pole .
With ample shading provided by low hanging boughs , a translucent corrugated fiberglass was used to clad the project .
Throughout the day , the opalescent skin transmits the movement of shadows from the exterior to the interior .
The slats on the interior were painted colours selected by Jorin and Matana on three sides which , depending on the sun , reflects colour back onto the skin .

On a dreary morning not long ago , Cara Muhlhahn is tooling through Brooklyn in her dented Prius , which she calls her “ Mobile On - Call Unit . ”
Since Muhlhahn is a home - birth midwife , appointments both prenatal and postnatal — and , of course , the big show itself — take place within clients ’ homes , and she spends a great deal of her time speeding between boroughs and racking up two grand a year in parking tickets .
When a woman goes into labor , “ they ’re always like , ‘ How did you get here so fast ? ’ ” she says .
“ Mobile On - Call Unit ! ”
This morning ’s first appointment — or “ mommy , ” as Muhlhahn refers to her patients — is Kristy Bloom , a 30 - year - old preschool teacher who lives in Carroll Gardens .
Bloom is a first - time mother , a “ primip ” in obstetrical parlance , in her 38th week of pregnancy .
While Kristy ’s husband , Doug , lugs the birthing tub from Muhlhahn ’s car up the stairs , Kristy tells me how hiring Muhlhahn was literally a dream realized .
In her first weeks of pregnancy , she ’d watched the 2008 Ricki Lake–produced low - budget documentary The Business of Being Born .
“ I cried through the whole movie , ” she says .
“ And then I was in the bathtub and I had this whole vision of the birth and Cara was there .
And I came out of the bath and said , ‘ Babe , that woman ’s going to be our midwife . ’ ”
Since participating in The Business of Being Born — or BOBB , as it ’s known to the initiated — Muhlhahn has become the most visible proselytizer of the home - birth movement .
She just released a memoir called Labor of Love , in which she headily describes her work : “ Day after day , I deliver babies , save lives , facilitate and witness near miracles . ”
She calls her duties as a mouthpiece for the movement her “ Moses responsibility . ”
And she ’s hoping to grow her home - birth service to handle the increasing demand in New York , where the numbers are already overburdening the nine home - birth midwives in practice here .
You could n’t ask for a better home - birth sales pitch than BOBB .
The film presents a horrifically plausible portrayal of a hospital childbirth system gone insane , of labor turned into a medical pathology : the continuous fetal heart - rate monitoring that makes it difficult for a mother to get off her back and into a position that actually encourages birth ; the fear of lawsuits that compels doctors to perform C- sections on babies experiencing even normal distress during labor ; the “ failure to progress ” — medicalese for laboring in a rentable hospital bed too long — that causes doctors to initiate a chain of “ unnecessary interventions ” like the artificial - induction hormone pitocin paired with epidural anesthesia , which seem to manufacture their own fetal distress , which in turn produces more C sections .
Even obstetricians admit that the shocking rise in C - sections — in 2006 , 31 percent of all babies were born this way , up 50 percent from a decade before — has done nothing to improve infant - or maternal - mortality statistics .
BOBB did n’t really break news , but it did introduce the natural - birth argument to a new mainstream audience .
“ Nobody in Manhattan other than the real crunchy , hair - underneath - the - arm granola types knew anything about home birth , ” says Jacques Moritz , a pro-midwifery obstetrician at St. Luke ’s - Roosevelt who was featured in the film .
“ The movie changed everything .
I hate to say these things go into fashion , but they do . ”
More than anything else , BOBB de-radicalized home birth , conflating it with garden - variety natural childbirth and allowing Muhlhahn , largely unchallenged , to argue for its safety .
There are only two options when it comes to childbirth , the film seems to say , comparing shots of ecstatic mothers hoisting their babies at home with shots of women under bad hospital light screaming for rescue .
Muhlhahn is offered up as the eminently reasonable alternative to the medical mess , shown in her East Village apartment in the predawn hours , tucking her instruments into a doctor ’s bag , looking like the medical pro she is , a dean ’s - list graduate from Columbia ’s School of Nursing .
( She says she had the grades for med school , but revels in her decision to skip eight years of “ character - warping educational methods . ” )
She looks nothing like the hippie - midwife stereotype .
“ Downright sexy ” is how Ricki Lake has described Muhlhahn , a youthful 51 - year - old with low - rise jeans and a husky Debra Winger laugh .
She also does n’t practice like a typical midwife .
Personal experience has led her to dismiss many of what she calls the “ myths ” that are still taught in school as the bedrock of safe practice .
The big babies — ten- pounders and more — that most obstetricians are loath to deliver vaginally , because of the risk that their shoulders will get stuck in the birth canal , are nothing more than “ fit challenges ” to Muhlhahn , necessitating only patience .
She regularly does vaginal births after C- section at home , and has even home - delivered the riskiest births , breeches and twins .
“ She ’ll put herself on the line way more than most people , like taking on a birth that ’s a little more high risk that most midwives would n’t take , ” says Abby Epstein , BOBB ’s director .
“ It ’s not that she ’s a cowboy .
It ’s because she wants to serve these couples that say , ‘ I trust my body .
I believe in this process . ’
She puts her ass on the line in a huge way every time she kind of steps out of bounds to help somebody .
That ’s just who she is . ”

When my wife , Robin , found out she was pregnant , she insisted I queue BOBB on Netflix .
I ’d never even heard of it , but Robin had read about it in Vogue , and all our pregnant friends had seen it .
My friend Michael from Park Slope said it ’s always popping up in that what - your - neighbors - are - watching feature on Netflix .
Robin and I happened to be in the midst of a maddening search for the perfect doctor .
Several years ago she ’d been diagnosed with lupus , a disease that makes it more difficult to carry babies to term .
She was , in obstetrical terms , “ high risk , ” a label that automatically excludes women from most offices , except the enormous and impersonal hospital practices that can afford the monstrously expensive high - risk malpractice insurance .
So we found ourselves , unhappily , in a large high - risk practice at NYU .
The waits were excruciating , the offices sterile , and it became obvious at each visit that without our chart the doctor would n’t have known whether we were there to have a baby or take her lunch order .
Muhlhahn was different .
One hot day last August , we went to her home office on 11th Street between Avenues B and C .
A female assistant brought us into a waiting room decorated like a Moroccan souk .
I was touched by her interest and impressed by the amount of time she was willing to devote to our case .
But I was concerned by her lack of experience with lupus , and mystified by her reaction when Robin brought up the idea of delivering with a highly recommended midwife who delivers the babies of high - risk patients at St. Vincent ’s .
Muhlhahn rolled her eyes .
“ You might as well go with an obstetrician , ” she scoffed .
I could tell that Robin was lapping up the home - birth pitch : no drugs to cloud baby ’s or mother ’s mind , no separation from baby , no cutting , and the promise of an unparalleled sense of accomplishment and an indescribable hormonal rush .
Like many women , Robin recognized her opportunity to experience — to feel — one of the few truly primal experiences life still offers .
“ You will go into an altered state of consciousness , ” says medical anthropologist Robbie Davis - Floyd in BOBB .
“ And you cannot have the bliss without the pain . ”
The goal is , in Muhlhahn ’s words , to render the experience “ more poetic than clinical . ”
To that end , Lake and Epstein will soon put out a book , Your Best Birth , that approaches birth the way a wedding guide might , with chapters like “ The Guest List ” and “ Loving Your Labor . ”
During the birth of her first son , Lake was crestfallen to be transferred from the birthing center at St. Luke ’s - Roosevelt to the labor and delivery ward after her labor stalled .
“ I wanted it a certain way , ” Lake tells me .
“ I ’m like a type A , a Virgo , and I had mapped out this birth plan and I wanted a certain song playing and the whole thing . ”
Epstein , upon seeing a room at the Roosevelt birthing center , said it reminded her of a “ cheesy hot - tub suite in a slightly run-down Las Vegas hotel . ”
Why settle for this when you can have prosecco in bed followed by a delicious homemade pasta Bolognese , as the writer Daphne Beal chronicled in a piece about her idyllic home birth in Vogue ?
But even more essential than promised nirvana or perfect aesthetics is the implication that messing with the birthing process can affect the bonding between mother and child .
In BOBB , French obstetrician and natural - birth pioneer Michel Odent contends that a “ complex cocktail of love hormones … create a state of dependency , addiction ” between mother and child .
Interrupting that natural flow with drugs or a Cesarean , he posits , invites dire consequences .
“ It ’s simple , ” he says .
“ If monkeys give birth by Cesarean section , the mother is not interested in her baby …
So you wonder , what about … the future of humanity ? ”
When you ask Muhlhahn ’s many happy customers to recount their birth stories , they struggle a bit ; you suspect they feel the way an astronaut might attempting to describe space travel to someone who ’s never flown in a plane .
“ When you get through that transition , and you experience the birth of your child , you get the endorphins , the best bonding experience , I mean , I ca n’t even explain how meaningful and important and life - changing an event it was , ” says Jeannie Gaffigan , who delivered her second child with Muhlhahn .
( Her husband , comedian Jim Gaffigan , recounted their experience onstage : “ [ Home birth ] means you take the hundreds of years of medical knowledge and just throw that away .
And you wing it !
Hey , I ca n’t program a VCR .
I ’m here to help .
Where would you like me to stand terrified ? ” )
Joking aside , women turn to Muhlhahn because she inspires confidence in them — confidence in her clinical skills and knowledge of the birth process but also confidence that their bodies are fully capable of the arduous task .
Her admirers say that she ’s gifted at intuiting when a laboring mother needs cheerleading and hand - holding and when she needs her to step back and leave her to labor in peace .
“ You really do develop a relationship and a friendship with her , ” says Leigh Pennebaker , a sculptor who delivered with Muhlhahn in 2007 .
“ You do n’t feel like a number , or a random patient , and you never feel that clock ticking .
What she offers is just so remarkable . ”

But labor is an unpredictable thing , and sometimes the experience is more nightmarish than poetic .
Muhlhahn ’s patient Sandra Garcia was one week overdue when her water finally broke on a Sunday night in early November .
She labored that night and through the next day assisted by her husband , Jeff Wise , and her doula , a former NYU postpartum nurse who was now working for Muhlhahn .
( Muhlhahn , busy with another labor , appeared only sporadically . )
Monday night , Garcia was approaching 24 hours of labor .
Most hospitals insist that a baby be delivered no more than 24 hours after membrane rupture because of the risk of infection , but Muhlhahn is n’t a big clock - watcher .
Instead , she takes precautions to avoid infections : “ After rupture , ” she says , “ no routine exams , no baths , no sex . ” By 10 p.m. , the doula decided that Garcia was about to deliver .
So , with candles lit , Garcia got in the birthing tub , which , because of the risk of infection , represents the endgame , the mother ’s pushing venue .
Except it was n’t time to push .
At Garcia ’s insistence , Muhlhahn performed an exam at around 3:30 a.m. and discovered she was only a half - inch dilated .
The doula had somehow misjudged her progression .
Still , Muhlhahn was n’t concerned .
“ There ’s no such thing as stalled labor , ” they remember her assuring them .
“ Labor just takes a long time . ”
With that , she left to deliver another baby .
Late Wednesday afternoon , nearly 72 hours into his wife ’s labor , Wise started to freak out .
The doula had gone home to rest .
It was getting dark .
They had no instrument to check the baby ’s heart rate .
His wife ’s face was pallid , her knees and elbows raw from supporting her weight during the contractions .
The apartment reeked of vomit and urine from her catheter .
“ How long is too long for a woman to be in labor ? ”
Wise demanded to know when Muhlhahn finally returned to the apartment that night .
“ Never , ” Muhlhahn replied flatly .
Her philosophy was simple :
Trust the wisdom of the body to send the baby out when it ’s ready .
But she agreed to examine Garcia again .
If she had n’t progressed significantly , they ’d go to St. Vincent ’s .
The results were startling : two centimeters .
She had hardly progressed at all .
Garcia crouched on all fours in the back seat of Muhlhahn ’s Prius as they drove to the hospital .
When they arrived , Garcia was surprised by her reaction to the place she ’d been avoiding .
“ It was a feeling of , ‘ Oh my God .
Here are people in their white lab coats who know what they ’re doing , and there ’s equipment and medicine here . ’
Then I looked over at Cara with her crazy hair and ragtag clothes and I said to myself , ‘ What was I thinking ? ’ ” They learned that the baby was facing Garcia ’s belly and that this “ back labor ” was likely why she had felt so much pain and progressed so little .
The next morning , Garcia woke with a 103 - degree fever , a sign of infection .
An exam showed that after 84 hours of labor , she was still less than five centimeters dilated .
The baby had to come out by C-section .
Remment Garcia
Wise weighed in at eight pounds , eleven ounces , about two pounds more than Muhlhahn had estimated .
Rem was whisked away to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit , where he stayed for five days .
It was far worse than any scenario Garcia had sought to avoid with a home birth .
“ How do you feel about having a C - section ? ” Muhlhahn asked the couple at a follow - up appointment to discuss what had happened .
It was the first they ’d spoken to her since she ’d dropped them off at the hospital .
Garcia felt the question was barbed with the implication that if she ’d only had more patience — tried harder — she could have had a vaginal birth .
“ I had a plan the whole time , ” Muhlhahn told them , “ and you just did n’t trust me . ”
Muhlhahn calls St. Vincent ’s her “ backup hospital . ”
About 10 percent of her patients end up transferring there during labor .
But her relationship with the hospital is not exactly formal .
“ St. Vincent ’s is her dump , ” says one former obstetrics resident who ’s treated Muhlhahn ’s transfers .
“ She could say any hospital is her backup , because no hospital is ever going to deny a woman care .
She ’d bring her patients in , holding their hands , find out we were going to have to do a section , and then she ’s out the door .
To me , that ’s a dump . ”
Other doctors on the floor have referred to her transferred patients as “ train wrecks . ”
There is , of course , a long - standing animosity between doctors and midwives , particularly those who take births out of hospitals .
In a 2008 policy statement , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reiterated its position against home birth : “ Childbirth decisions should not be dictated or influenced by what ’s fashionable , trendy , or the latest cause célèbre . ”
But St. Vincent ’s seems to have bridged the divide better than most hospitals .
George Mussalli , the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology since 2006 , has fostered much goodwill within the midwifery community .
Joan Bryson , a veteran home - birth midwife out of Park Slope , and Karen Jefferson and Martine Jean - Baptiste , the home - birth duo that goes by JJB Midwifery , actually have hospital privileges there .

Muhlhahn claims that she could have privileges at St. Vincent ’s as well , but she prefers not to be encumbered by the hospital ’s restrictions .
“ I actually like legitimacy .
I do n’t enjoy being an outlaw , ” she says .
But there are ways in which she has made herself an outlaw of sorts — by not carrying malpractice insurance , for instance .
“ I think she ’s dangerous , ” says a member of the obstetrics staff at St. Vincent ’s .
“ You need to be accountable .
Something bad is going to happen with her approach to management .
Bad things happen to all of us . ”
Though it is required by law for every midwife in New York to have one , Muhlhahn also does n’t have a signed practice agreement with a physician , a document that outlines the parameters of a midwife ’s care and the protocols under which a mother would automatically “ risk out ” of home birth .
According to most practice agreements , vaginal births after Cesareans , diabetics , breech babies , twins , and many overdue and oversize babies merit hospital births .
Muhlhahn ’s website touts studies showing home births to be just as safe as hospital births , but when these kinds of high - risk births are included in statistics , the home - birth perinatal mortality rate jumps to fourteen per thousand versus five per thousand in the hospital , according to a University of Arizona study .
“ How long is too long for a woman to be in labor ? ” the father - to - be asked .
“ Never , ” Muhlhahn replied .
Obstetrician Jacques Moritz is no partisan in any doctor - versus - midwife battle .
To the jeers of many of his M.D. colleagues , he hosted a screening of BOBB at St. Luke ’s - Roosevelt .
His own mother was a midwife , and he has signed practice agreements with twelve midwives who work at the Roosevelt birthing center .
He would n’t , however , do the same for Muhlhahn .
“ I like her , but there ’s some protocols that she has that I just ca n’t sign off on , ” he says .
Like the breech babies and vaginal births after Cesarean ( VBACs ) she says she ’s performed at home ?
“ That ’s like bragging , ” he says .
“ There ’s a lot of stuff I ’ve done , too , and said afterward , ‘ Wow , I did n’t know I could do that . ’
But I would n’t want to do it again . ”
“ I ’m not that comfortable with VBACs at home , ” says Muhlhahn , “ but I know most can have them fine .
Most VBAC mommies know they have less of a chance of giving birth vaginally in a hospital . ”
For all her home - birth successes — she has delivered more than 700 babies —
Muhlhahn has also had some tragedies .
In 2003 , she and her former birthing center settled a $ 950,000 malpractice suit brought by the parents of a child who was injured during delivery .
As the baby ’s head was crowning , he suffered a shoulder dystocia , when a baby ’s shoulders get stuck behind the mother ’s pelvis .
It was imperative to get the baby out quickly , because he could n’t breathe in that position .
“ Cara was crying and saying that she thought she was going to lose the baby , ” Yvette Garcia , the boy ’s mother , said in a deposition .
The child survived , but the cervical nerves in his neck were damaged , rendering his right arm paralyzed , a condition called Erb ’s Palsy .
According to Garcia ’s deposition , when she first brought the boy to the family pediatrician , the doctor took one look at the lame appendage and “ knew that the baby was yanked out . ”
Garcia ’s complaint argued that Muhlhahn should have known that the baby would be too large for a vaginal delivery .
In her memoir , Muhlhahn tells the worst story of all :
In the summer of 2007 , a woman named Lisa was at the end of a particularly long labor .
As the head crowned , Muhlhahn noticed the baby ’s heartbeat decelerate .
She kicked once from inside her mother , and then was still .
Muhlhahn got the baby out and began CPR , but could n’t revive her .
“ Why had everything I had counted on that had worked for the last twenty years failed ? ” she writes .
“ We all had to ask ourselves if this baby would have been alive if indeed she had been born in the hospital . ”
Moritz says
Muhlhahn should go easy on herself ; if a clinician has n’t lost a baby , she just has n’t done enough births .
“ The problem is that we ’re talking about the possibility the outcome would be different , ” he says .
“ No one who loses a baby in a hospital says , ‘ Oh , I wonder if this would have been better if I ’d done it at home ? ’ ”
My wife and I decided not to go with a home birth , not least because Robin ’s rheumatologist threatened to drop her as a patient if she chose that route .
In Robin ’s 39th week , during a routine test at our doctor ’s office , the baby ’s heartbeat decelerated precipitously .
The doctor sent her to NYU to be monitored for a couple of hours , and while she was there , her water broke .
The decelerations continued , corresponding to Robin ’s contractions ; every time she clenched up , you could see the heart rate plunge from 130 beats per minute down to 60 on the monitor , then right back up again .
They made V shapes on the tape .

Very quickly , our plot unfurled much like the nightmare scenarios in BOBB .
Since Robin ’s water had broken , the clock was ticking , so the nurse gave her pitocin to get things moving .
Soon , the contractions were so intense that Robin was screaming for the anesthesiologist .
The epidural brought instant pain relief , but the V shapes on the monitor continued with each contraction .
Some time later , a resident burst into the room .
“ We ’re concerned about your baby , ” he said .
“ He ’s been recovering well from the decelerations up to this point , but we do n’t know how long that will last .
We want to get him out . ”
And then he gave us a meaningful look .
“ I know you did n’t want it to go this way , ” he said , “ but the good news is if you decide to have another baby , you ’ll be a great candidate for a vaginal birth . ”
Just like that , we were handed a rain check for the birth we had hoped for .
Henry was born at 2:30 a.m. , ten hours after Robin had gone into labor .
In retrospect , I have no idea whether he was ever in real danger .
Maybe she could have pushed him out .
Maybe if we ’d never seen those fetal - monitor strips , we would have assumed he was all right , and in all likelihood he would have been .
But in Robin ’s telling of the story , Henry was in real danger .
There was n’t even a question of what to do .
What I do know is that in the moment that resident hoisted the little boy over the curtain protecting me and Robin from the sight of her exposed viscera , everything changed about that place .
The nursing staff was warm , competent , and quick to respond .
Contrary to everything I ’d heard , the hospital never tried to separate us from our baby .
( One of the ways the influence of midwives has made hospital births a more humane experience . )
Robin was in pain , but happier than I ’d ever seen her .
I began to wonder if “ labor amnesia ” — the idea that evolution has made sure mothers do n’t remember much of the pain of childbirth — might apply to C- sections as well .
When women meet their healthy babies , they are so overcome with joy that they forget about the horror and construct a memory of something far more beautiful .
The McNally Jackson bookstore in Soho can barely contain the crowd that comes out to celebrate the publication of Muhlhahn ’s memoir , Labor of Love .
There are not enough folding chairs to accommodate all the women who ’ve shown up .
Store owner Sarah McNally is lugging around Jasper , the 5 - month - old product of a twelve - hour birth with Muhlhahn , and laughing about the doula who had tried to hydrate her with ginger ale .
( “ I do n’t mean to be rude , ” McNally had told her , “ but I do n’t drink high - fructose corn syrup . ” )
Novelist and The Believer editor Heidi Julavits arrives with 2 - week - old Solomon tucked into a Moby wrap ; she ’d used Muhlhahn ’s colleague Miriam Schwarzchild .
There is much talk of empowering feats of strength and hormone highs .
“ I felt like a superhero , ” says Daphne Beal , the author of the Vogue article about home birth .
“ I envisioned myself climbing up a building Spiderman style . ”
“ I had a birth this morning , so I ’m sleep - deprived , as usual .
I did seven births in eleven days ! ”
Muhlhahn says , seemingly astounded by her own stamina .
Thanks to BOBB , the last 24 months have been the busiest in the dozen years since she first set up a solo practice in the bedroom of her Stuy Town apartment .
Recently , she has more than tripled the number of births she takes on , to ten a month .
Before signing books , Muhlhahn sits on a panel and answers questions .
“ Have you observed a difference in home - birth versus hospital babies ? ” asks one menopausal woman in a beret .
“ Are they calmer ? ” Muhlhahn responds that no scholarship on such a thing exists , but says , “ The baby born this morning was just so calm … Even though that might not be measurable data , these outcomes are extremely important to the human race . ”
The woman nods , satisfied .
“ It ’s a great place to start , ” she enthuses .
The panel ’s star , however , might be Jessica Robinson , who receives gasps from the impressed crowd for revealing a thumbnail of her experience : 76 hours of labor , which included a 30 - block walk on her third day and an episode in which Muhlhahn had to coax her out of the bathroom of a Brooklyn acupuncturist ’s office .
The adventure eventually yielded a ten - pound , twelve - ounce boy , the heaviest baby Muhlhahn had ever delivered to a primip .
“ It just seemed , ” Muhlhahn says , savoring the victory , “ like a completely normal delivery . ”
President Franklin D. Roosevelt admonished in a 1932 commencement address that “ it is common sense to take a method and try it .
If it fails , admit it frankly and try another . ” FDR had the revival of a depressed U.S. economy in mind , but scientists experimenting with treating brain disorders with fetal cell transplants have taken his aphorism to heart .
New methods are transforming past failures , and the results seem far more promising this go - round .
Fetal cell therapy began in earnest in the mid-1980s , among researchers hoping to treat Parkinson ’s disease .
These patients have trouble controlling their movements partly because their brains lack the neurotransmitter dopamine .
The hope was that tissue from fetal midbrains placed into patients ’ brains would turn into dopamine - making cells .
Shortly after the turn of the century , however , the work foundered when a subset of transplant patients developed disabling movement disorders termed runaway dyskinesias .
But amid the setbacks was the fact that some subjects — especially those who were younger and less afflicted — did well with the fetal cells .
“ The question is , How do we reconcile all these disparate strands and problems with these trials and move the field forward ? ” says Roger Barker , a neurologist at the University of Cambridge who is meta- analyzing prior transplant data in hopes of devising a better trial .
One possible explanation for the mixed findings is contamination : transplant tissue containing serotonin - secreting neurons could have muddied the results .
Although fetal cells may need support from other , nearby cells in a tissue transplant , Barker concedes that the field is moving to transplanting pure stem cells , rather than tissue .
He and others are particularly heartened by safety results last year of the first fetal neural stem cell trial approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The phase I trial enrolled children born with Batten disease , a fatal neurodegenerative illness in which genetic mutations render patients unable to produce enzymes needed to clear cellular waste .
In the trial , six children had up to one billion fetal neural stem cells injected into the ventricles of the brain or into white matter tracts .
None exhibited ill effects , and an autopsy of one child who died from the natural course of the disease indicated that the transplanted cells had grafted nicely into the brain .
This result is a big advance in the field , says Robert Steiner of the Oregon Health and Science University who was a principal investigator on the trial .
“ This is a much more sophisticated approach to doing neural cell transplants by actually purifying and only using fetal neural cells rather than the mix of cells used in the earlier trials , ” he notes .
Achieving high degrees of purity — that is , assuring that the vast majority of cells being transplanted are only neural stem cells — requires careful separation of cells .
StemCells in Palo Alto , Calif. , which produced the cells for the trial , employed a technique that labels fetal neural stem cells with a fluorescent tag .
That makes them easy to see and sort from other cells .
With the technique , the firm says that at least 90 percent of their proprietary cells are neural stem cells — a critical benchmark for FDA approval in clinical trials .
The success of the safety trial has given the FDA confidence to green - light a second trial , this time for children with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) , a genetic disorder that compromises the creation of myelin , a fatty substance that sheaths the axons of nerves .
The trial will inject neural stem cells into the brains of four children with PMD and use magnetic resonance imaging to track new myelin formation .
Preclinical trials in animal models of PMD have demonstrated that the cells can differentiate into myelin - forming cells called oligodendrocytes and successfully create myelin sheaths , but they have yet to prove they can restore function .
Cells that are more developed might lead to functional results .
Steven Goldman of the University of Rochester isolated neural stem cells of fetal origin that had differentiated into the progenitor cells of oligodendrocytes .
When injected into mouse models of PMD , the precursor cells improved the health of afflicted rodents , which also lived a normal life span .
Scientists debate the best method of obtaining the cells .
Rather than sorting primary cells in various stages of differentiation , for instance , Geron in Menlo Park , Calif. , can induce the appropriate precursor cells from human embryonic stem cells .
( Geron received FDA approval to use the cells for trials last year . )
But in the end , only clinical trials can determine the best strategies .
“ Because now we have better ways of identifying the potentially regenerative cells in the fetal populations , we can probably perform more powerful and better targeted studies than before , ” remarks Charles ffrench - Constant , an expert in regenerative neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh .
Certainly for advocates , fetal cell transplantations are emerging from their dark days and moving into a reenergized spotlight .
Note :
This story was originally printed with the title " Back into the Folds "
Not to dump the gory details of my life on you , dear readers , but I recently married .
This occasion had been preceded by many years and many manifestations of commitment phobia , not least of all the persistent if irrational thought that , despite all evidence to the contrary ( I am nearing 40 ) , I was simply too young to get hitched .
FOR THE RECORD :
Divorce : Meghan Daum ’s column Thursday said that supporters of an initiative banning divorce were seeking to get it on the ballot in March .
The election is in June . —
But in late October , I found myself walking arm in arm with my brand - new spouse ( who ’d been just as altar - avoidant as I ) down the streets of Manhattan after a small , ad hoc ceremony in Central Park ( ad hoc in that we had no chairs for our guests , not in that we ’d gone jogging and suddenly decided to stop and recite some vows ) .
Given that I happened to be wearing a seasonally inappropriate white dress , we caused a bit of a scene .
Tourists snapped photos .
Passersby cheered and applauded and gave us high fives .
How reassuring , I thought to myself .
How cozy and inspiring in an “ it takes a village ” kind of way .
Maybe marriage is n’t so scary after all .
Maybe the threat of divorce does n’t hover above us all like a menacing Zeppelin .
“ Congratulations ! ” a man shouted .
“ Thanks ! ” we yelled back .
Then the man turned to his buddy and said , not exactly sotto voce , “ All my weddings sucked . ”
Hey , it ’s just like the commercial .
Dress : $ 600 .
Shoes : $ 200 .
Rings : $ 1,000 .
Getting a reality check approximately eight minutes after saying “ I do ” : priceless !
I thought of that guy recently when I read that John Marcotte , the Sacramento political activist and comedy writer who began campaigning this summer for a statewide ban on divorce , received the go - ahead from the California secretary of state to try to collect about 700,000 signatures to get it on the ballot in March .
Marcotte , who is married and says his wife was among the first signers , calls the movement -- the 2010 California Marriage Protection Act -- a natural extension of the 2008 California Marriage Protection Act , a.k.a.
Proposition 8 , which banned gay marriage .
His website is rife with slogans such as “ Closing the budget gap -- one marriage at a time ” and “ You said ‘ Til death do us part . ’
You ’re not dead yet . ”
You can also buy T - shirts .
“ Proposition 8 tried to make traditional marriage safer by making sure that Adam Lambert and Ryan Seacrest can’t profess their eternal love to one another , ” Marcotte writes .
“ Prop. 8 backers recognized that gay marriage was just the beginning of a very slippery slope .
Next , people would be marrying goats , trees and particularly stylish armchairs . ”
So , uh , yes , the thing is a stunt .
And , uh , no , Seacrest has never said he is gay ( as for Lambert , I only figured out who he was about five minutes ago , but apparently he ’s said he is ) .
Marcotte ’s project is a political statement designed to call the bluff of the very group it ’s pretending to embrace : those seeking to protect marriage by limiting it to heterosexuals .
The measure , of course , is n’t meant to pass but rather to expose the hypocrisy of those who see gay marriage as a threat to their own unions .
“ Prop. 8 only attacked the problem from the edges , ” Marcotte writes .
“ I ’m going after the heart of the matter .
. . .
If you ca n’t get divorced , you ca n’t destroy traditional marriage . ”
Never mind that more than a few commenters on Marcotte ’s site ,
rescuemarriage.org , do n’t seem to get the joke , a confusion that ’s resulted in as much unwarranted indignation ( “ What you are trying to impose is communistic .
Not democratic . ” ) as misplaced elation ( “ This article is so right on ! ” ) .
Never mind that much of the media coverage suggests that certain interviewers can’t tell that he ’s kidding .
Never mind that the measure probably wo n’t make the ballot even if it gets those 700,000 signatures and they ’re all valid ; a lawsuit could easily keep it off the ballot .
In the end , Marcotte wins either way .
The Facebook page for the California Protection of Marriage Act has garnered more than 23,000 fans , and MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann tipped his hat to Marcotte on a “ Best Person in the World ” segment last month .
I ’m probably not enough of a joiner to add my name to the Facebook page , but I ’m glad Marcotte is fighting the good fight .
He ’s fighting not just for the rights of gays and lesbians , who surely deserve to be feted as they parade down the street in post - wedding rapture , but also for the cause of irony itself , which -- in this often painfully literal society -- needs all the help it can get .
My husband and I still think the moment when the guy said all his weddings sucked was one of the best parts of our own wedding .
Does n’t everyone , gay or straight , deserve to hear that kind of gem ?
At the very least , everyone should be able to utter it .
And somehow “ all my civil union ceremonies sucked ” just does n’t sound the same .

Pro-Israel lobbyists won the support of 77 senators ( out of 100 ) for a letter sent to President Barack Obama that urged him to " press Arab leaders " to consider making dramatic , upfront peace overtures to Israel .
But one key Arab state , Saudi Arabia , has already clearly communicated its refusal to make any such gestures at this time .
On July 31 , Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal told journalists in Washington that " Confidence - building measures will not bring peace .
What is required is a comprehensive approach that defines the final outcome at the outset and launches into negotiations over final - status issues . "
Saudi Arabia is one of the most influential players in Arab - Israeli peacemaking .
But given its pivotal position in international energy markets  and the fact that it has no need of U.S. financial aid  it is almost immune to American pressure .
In their role as " Guardians " of two of Islam ’s three holiest cities  Mecca and Medina  Saudi Arabia ’s monarchs have always had a strong concern for the welfare of the Muslim institutions in Islam ’s third holy city , Jerusalem  and a desire to see a fair and durable final peace between Israelis and Palestinians .
However , like the vast majority of other Arabs , Saudi Arabia ’s rulers are currently very wary of getting drawn into any diplomatic process that aims not at securing the final peace treaties between Israel and its Arab neighbors but rather at further , possibly lengthy , " interim " moves .
From the Arab perspective , that focus on endless " interim " steps was what dominated the eight years of former U.S. president Bill Clinton ’s Arab - Israeli diplomacy  and meanwhile , Israel continued to implant scores of thousands of additional settlers into East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank throughout those years .
Israel ’s implantation of additional settlers into the West Bank continued under former U.S. president George W. Bush .
Now , there are 500,000 settlers in the West Bank  including more than 200,000 in East Jerusalem alone .
Their presence considerably complicates the quest for a fair and sustainable peace .
It is also , under international law , quite illegal .
The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 forbids any government running a military occupation of land not its own from implanting its own civilians into the occupied area .
The Saudis argue that Israel deserves no special " rewards " for stopping its continued perpetration of this illegal act .
They say that the U.S. , which gives substantial financial and military aid to Israel , should work to ensure that this stoppage occurs forthwith  and that later , in the context of the final peace accord , the vast majority of the illegally implanted settlers should return to Israel along with Israel ’s occupation army .
Many Americans " have said if the Arabs do something nice for Israel this will somehow get you something in terms of an Israeli gesture  progress toward peace between Israelis and Palestinians , " noted Chas W. Freeman , a distinguished former U.S. diplomat who was ambassador to Saudi Arabia ( 1989 - 92 ) and has a deep knowledge of the kingdom ’s affairs .
" In fact absolutely none of the gestures that have been made , including the very important one of the Arab League ’s Beirut Declaration of 2002  the so - called Arab Peace Initiative  has resulted in any positive response from the Israelis .
They have been content to pocket whatever has been offered and to do nothing in return . "
Freeman observed , " There is no predisposition whatsoever  in fact a lot of predisposition to the contrary  on the Arab side to pay for what Israel , in its own interest , ought to do . "
The strength of the Saudis ’ opposition to additional interim - focused , confidence - building measures in the Israeli - Arab arena  like the kingdom ’s views on several other issues , including Iran  seem not to have been well understood by all members of the Obama administration .
In April , Dennis Ross , an administration official with a shifting and fuzzy  but apparently high - level  portfolio , visited the kingdom and attempted to lecture King Abdullah ibn Abdul - Aziz about the need to confront " the Iranian threat . "
But New York Times columnist Roger Cohen has written that when Abdullah got a word in edgewise and asked some reasonable questions about Washington ’s policy , Ross was unable to answer and appeared " a little flustered . "
Ross was the man who throughout Clinton ’s presidency had been in charge of all Israeli - Arab peace negotiations , and presumably dealt closely with the Saudis and other Arabs .
Observers noted that it therefore seemed strange that he did not know how to deal effectively with the man who , before he became king in 2005 , had already been the power behind the Saudi throne for more than a decade .
In early June  the day before the much - publicized address Obama made to the Muslim world from Cairo  Obama made a quick visit to Saudi Arabia and had his first meeting with Abdullah .
There are some indications that during that meeting he may have asked Abdullah to undertake some confidence - building steps toward Israel in return for an Israeli halt on settlement - building .
In the Cairo speech , Obama said , " the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning , but not the end of their responsibilities . "
He called on the Arab states to act " to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state , [ and ] to recognize Israel ’s legitimacy . "
The clear implication was that he was asking the Arab states to undertake these actions now , or in return for an Israeli settlement - building halt , rather than as an eventual reward after the conclusion of final peace treaties .
On July 22 , the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ’s tiny neighbor and ally Bahrain published an opinion piece in the Washington Post in which he called on his fellow Arabs to start sending help to Palestinian institutions and to reach out to the Israeli public  though notably not , at this point , to the Israeli government .
Analysts noted that that initiative from Bahrain was most likely encouraged by the Saudi government  or at least , was cleared with Riyadh .
On July 27 , Obama ’s senior peace envoy George Mitchell was in Cairo .
He told reporters that Washington was eager to secure a " comprehensive " peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors
He also asked all the countries in the region to set the " context " for starting these negotiations .
" By comprehensive I mean peace between Israel and Palestinians , between Israel and Syria , between Israel and Lebanon , and the full normalization of relations between Israel and the countries of the region , " he said .
He said , " We ’re not asking anyone to achieve full normalization at this time .
We recognize that will come further down the road in this process . "
But he added that Washington did want to see " meaningful steps by individual countries . "
However , the statements the Saudi foreign minister made in late July seemed like a clear indication that Saudi Arabia would not be taking such steps in the near future .
Three days later Kuwait ’s ruler , Sheikh Sabah al - Ahmed al - Sabah , met with Obama in the White House .
He , like the Saudis , spelled out that normalization with Israel would come about after the conclusion of the final peace , rather than as a lead - up to it .
The Saudis meanwhile seem to have given serious thought to how , exactly , they might help the still - struggling Palestinian institutions in the occupied territories .
The biggest problem there has been the stark conflict between the U.S. - backed Fatah party , which administers Palestinian institutions in some portions of the Israeli - occupied West Bank and the Islamist Hamas party , which governs in Israeli - besieged Gaza .
Back in February 2007 , King Abdullah brokered a brief reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas .
But the Bush administration in Washington conspired with some Fatah strongmen to break the terms of that Saudi - brokered deal , which then fell apart .
Now , as Fatah winds up its important Sixth General Conference in Bethlehem , King Abdullah has once again issued a clear call for unity among the Palestinians .
As a few thousand pious Muslims now prepare to leave both Gaza and the West Bank to travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage , there is some expectation their Saudi hosts may be able to do some good reconciliation work while they are there .

He is understandably pissed off , and US Airways has essentially told him to piss off because it was done for security reasons .
Of course !
We all know that if an Xbox 360 is checked , it could be used by the pilots , which would be distracting and dangerous .
Only by rendering it inoperable was US Airways able to keep our skies safe .

Tim McKernan was known for wearing a barrel , a cowboy hat , cowboy boots and not much else .
But it was enough to make him an icon at Denver Broncos games .
McKernan , better known as Barrel Man , died in his sleep Saturday morning of lung failure .
He was 69 .
The former mechanic for United Airlines began wearing a barrel in 1977 after making a $ 10 bet with his brother , Scott , that by wearing one during a Broncos game , he could get on television .
McKernan won the bet and the barrel he had painted to look like an Orange Crush soda can became his signature costume .
It resulted in him becoming one of the Broncos ’ most recognized fans .
“ He liked the attention .
He loved inspiring the fans and had a take - charge attitude , ” said McKernan ’s son , Todd , who said he was 17 when his dad first donned the costume .
“ My kids grew up knowing grandpa in the barrel , ” he added .
Tim McKernan had attended Broncos games since 1967 and had missed only four .
In 2003 , an aneurysm left him in the intensive care unit at St. Mary ’s Hospital in Grand Junction .
He was confined to a wheelchair and placed on oxygen , but he recovered .
About six years ago , he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , scarring of the lung , but in September 2009 , his breathing worsened .
He was hospitalized , but came home three weeks ago to receive hospice care , his family said .
Not about the money
“ I ’ve known Tim since 1978 , ” said Broncos spokesman Jim Saccamano .
“ The No. 1 neat thing about him was that he was not about using this as a tool for making money .
It was all about supporting the team .
. . .
Tim was a was a model of decorum .
He will be missed . ”
The McKernan family spent Saturday morning reminiscing about their legendary father , who they said was very proud to have been nicotine - free and alcohol - free for more than 25 years .
Todd McKernan said his father ’s first barrel was one that had been emptied of cleaning solvent , and over the years , he had acquired 21 different barrels , including one that was sold on Ebay in 2006 for $ 30,000 .
Family members spoke of how honored he felt when he got a black - tie invitation to attend John Elway ’s induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio , and his off - the - field friendships with former Broncos Rick Upchurch and Billy Thompson .
Tim McKernan witnessed many changes within the Broncos organization over the years , including a new football stadium and coaching changes .
His family said he called former Broncos coach Lou Saban “ Half - a - loaf Lou ” after the Broncos played a game against Miami , tied the score at 10 - 10 , and sat on the ball while not trying to score .
McKernan said , “ Lou had said , ‘ A half a loaf better than none . ’ “
Todd McKernan also said his father admired Broncos coaches Mike Shanahan and new - kid - on - the - block Josh McDaniels .
In 2007 , Tim McKernan retired his barrel and was honored by the Broncos during a halftime show where he was presented with a team football and other gifts and received lots of fan appreciation that moved him to tears .
But it was his experiences as Barrel Man that made him transform into a loud and boisterous mascot .
His children spoke of how some opposing fans treated Barrel Man with respect while others were n’t quite so friendly .
“ His worst experience was in San Diego , when someone tried to shove him down the stairs , but he loved going to Oakland Raiders ’ games where he would get to hang out with Raider Ron and other mascots in the Black Hole .
They protected him to the point of escorting him to the rest room , ” Todd McKernan said .
At home in fan Hall of Fame
Tim McKernan was the first Broncos fan to be inducted into the Visa Hall of Fans , which recognizes costume - wearing , face - painted , avid National Football League fans , in a ceremony held at the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
“ Outside the barrel , my father was very quiet , an introverted calm person , ” Todd McKernan said .
“ But when he put it on , he talked differently .
He swaggered and was transformed .
It allowed him to express himself . ”
Tim McKernan is survived by his wife , Becky ; nine children , Todd , Troy , Taryn , Tiffani , Melissa , Amber , David , Darryl and John ; 14 grandchildren ; and one great - grandson .
A memorial service for McKernan is pending .

Michael C. Hall , star of Showtime 's " Dexter " and , before that , HBO 's " Six Feet Under , " has been fighting cancer -- Hodgkin 's lymphoma , specifically -- and is recovering now that the disease is in remission , he revealed today in a statement .
Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most curable types of cancer , according to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society .
It is most likely to be diagnosed in people in their 20s or 30s , becoming less common in middle age and more common again after 60 .
" I feel fortunate to have been diagnosed with an imminently treatable and curable condition , " said Hall , who is 38 .
" I thank my doctors and nurses for their expertise and care . "
He 'll continue with scheduled treatments , he said -- and the Golden Globe nominee will also attend that award show Sunday ...

And some thought ocean acidification would destroy everything .
“ We were surprised that some organisms did n’t behave in the way we expected under elevated CO2 ″ … “ They were somehow able to manipulate CO2 … to build their skeletons . ”
From the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institute press release , just in time for Copenhagen .
In a striking finding that raises new questions about carbon dioxide ’s ( CO2 ) impact on marine life , Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) scientists report that some shell - building creatures — such as crabs , shrimp and lobsters — unexpectedly build more shell when exposed to ocean acidification caused by elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
Because excess CO2 dissolves in the ocean — causing it to “ acidify ” — researchers have been concerned about the ability of certain organisms to maintain the strength of their shells .
Carbon dioxide is known to trigger a process that reduces the abundance of carbonate ions in seawater — one of the primary materials that marine organisms use to build their calcium carbonate shells and skeletons .
The concern is that this process will trigger a weakening and decline in the shells of some species and , in the long term , upset the balance of the ocean ecosystem .
But in a study published in the Dec. 1 issue of Geology , a team led by former WHOI postdoctoral researcher Justin B. Ries found that seven of the 18 shelled species they observed actually built more shell when exposed to varying levels of increased acidification .
This may be because the total amount of dissolved inorganic carbon available to them is actually increased when the ocean becomes more acidic , even though the concentration of carbonate ions is decreased .
“ Most likely the organisms that responded positively were somehow able to manipulate … dissolved inorganic carbon in the fluid from which they precipitated their skeleton in a way that was beneficial to them , ” said Ries , now an assistant professor in marine sciences at the University of North Carolina .
“ They were somehow able to manipulate CO2 … to build their skeletons . ”
Organisms displaying such improvement also included calcifying red and green algae , limpets and temperate urchins .
Mussels showed no effect .
“ We were surprised that some organisms did n’t behave in the way we expected under elevated CO2 , ” said Anne L. Cohen , a research specialist at WHOI and one of the study ’s co-authors .
“ What was really interesting was that some of the creatures , the coral , the hard clam and the lobster , for example , did n’t seem to care about CO2 until it was higher than about 1,000 parts per million [ ppm ] . ”
Current atmospheric CO2 levels are about 380 ppm , she said .
Above this level , calcification was reduced in the coral and the hard clam , but elevated in the lobster
The “ take - home message , “ says Cohen , is that “ we ca n’t assume that elevated CO2 causes a proportionate decline in calcification of all calcifying organisms . ”
WHOI and the National Science Foundation funded the work .
Conversely , some organisms — such as the soft clam and the oyster — showed a clear reduction in calcification in proportion to increases in CO2 .
In the most extreme finding , Ries , Cohen and WHOI Associate Scientist Daniel C. McCorkle exposed creatures to CO2 levels more than seven times the current level .
This led to the dissolving of aragonite — the form of calcium carbonate produced by corals and some other marine calcifiers .
Under such exposure , hard and soft clams , conchs , periwinkles , whelks and tropical urchins began to lose their shells .
“ If this dissolution process continued for sufficient time , then these organisms could lose their shell completely , ” he said , “ rendering them defenseless to predators . ”
“ Some organisms were very sensitive , ” Cohen said , “ some that have commercial value .
But there were a couple that did n’t respond to CO2 or did n’t respond till it was sky - high — about 2,800 parts per million .
We ’re not expecting to see that [ CO2 level ] anytime soon . ”
The researchers caution , however , that the findings — and acidification ’s overall impact — may be more complex than it appears .
For example , Cohen says that available food and nutrients such as nitrates , phosphates and iron may help dictate how some organisms respond to carbon dioxide .
“ We know that nutrients can be very important , ” she says .
“ We have found that corals for example , that have plenty of food and nutrients can be less sensitive ” to CO2 .
“ In this study , the organisms were well fed and we did n’t constrain the nutrient levels .
“ I would n’t make any predictions based on these results .
What these results indicate to us is that the organism response to elevated CO2 levels is complex and we now need to go back and study each organism in detail . ”
Ries concurs that any possible ramifications are complex .
For example , the crab exhibited improved shell - building capacity , and its prey , the clams , showed reduced calcification .
“ This may initially suggest that crabs could benefit from this shift in predator - pray dynamics .
But without shells , clams may not be able to sustain their populations , and this could ultimately impact crabs in a negative way , as well , ” Ries said .
In addition , Cohen adds , even though some organisms such as crabs and lobsters appear to benefit under elevated CO2 conditions , the energy they expend in shell building under these conditions “ might divert from other important processes such as reproduction or tissue building . ”
Since the industrial revolution , Ries noted , atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased from 280 to nearly 400 ppm .
Climate models predict levels of 600 ppm in 100 years , and 900 ppm in 200 years .
“ The oceans absorb much of the CO2 that we release to the atmosphere , ” Ries says .
However , he warns that this natural buffer may ultimately come at a great cost .
“ It ’s hard to predict the overall net effect on benthic marine ecosystems , he says .
“ In the short term , I would guess that the net effect will be negative .
In the long term , ecosystems could re-stabilize at a new steady state .
“ The bottom line is that we really need to bring down CO2 levels in the atmosphere . ”
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a private , independent organization in Falmouth , Mass. , dedicated to marine research , engineering , and higher education .
Established in 1930 on a recommendation from the National Academy of Sciences , its primary mission is to understand the oceans and their interaction with the Earth as a whole , and to communicate a basic understanding of the oceans ’ role in the changing global environment .

I ’ve been reading a lot of fairytales lately ( four nieces and a nephew ) , and I ’ve come to the realization that many of these classic stories , though cute on the surface level , are harboring horrible messages when you look at them logically .
Here are a few well - known examples …
Jack and the Beanstalk Is n’t this story really about a moronic lowlife ( Jack ) who repeatedly robs a homeowner ( the Giant ) and then murders said homeowner when the homeowner tries to stop him ?
Maybe if the magic harp wanted to be rescued it would be different , but the harp tries to stop Jack .
Our hero is an unlikable dipshit .
He trades his poor family ’s only cow for “ magic ” beans ?
Basically it ’s the story of a guy who sells his parents ’ car for drugs , then robs and murders their rich neighbor to get back the money .
Rumpelstiltskin
A girl goes along with a lie her father tells the King about a skill she does n’t have , then she subcontracts the work out to an ugly laborer with a goofy name who really does have that skill , and then she tries to screw over the ugly laborer when payment is due .
Bragging , lying , taking advantage of “ undesirables , ” welshing on debts ?
And Rumpelstiltskin is the villain ?
What ’s the difference between this and a story about a white - trash dude who wants his daughter to marry some millionaire , so they pretend she ’s an amazing cook by hiring a Mexican lady whose name they never bother to ask , then refuse to pay the lady what they promised , so she blackmails them unless they can figure out her name ?
Sleeping Beauty
A girl lies in a coma , then a dude she ’s never met before breaks in and kisses her , and when she wakes up she loves him for it ?
Come on .
Cute on the surface level , sure , but is n’t the story just a fantasized glorification of sexual assault ?
Last time I checked if you try to make out with an unconscious girl you do n’t know , your ass is getting arrested .
Otherwise there ’d be a lot fewer rape charges after frat parties .
I mean , what if the prince in the story had felt her up too ?
Or tea - bagged her ?
Hey , he still got her out of the coma right ?
Hmm … is there already a porno called " Sleeping Booty ? "
Develop something that you think you 'll use for years
Early adopters
Simplicity matters
Be conservative about adding features
Be pragmatic about your roadmap
Do n't expect tons of code that you can actually merge
BSD can be a strength even in the business side
The first version of Redis was released to the public almost one year ago ( 10 months ago actually ) .
This seems like a good time to look back at the development process .
Redis can't be considered a successful project yet , it 's just too early , however the followings are a few concepts I learned in the last months that I feel like to share with you in the hope that I 'll be able to apply this ideas in the future , and in the hope that programmers interested in creating a new open source project will find something interesting here and possibly avoid some mistake .
Redis is not my first open source project .
My main past projects are hping and the Jim interpreter .
Still Redis is the first project I 'm sure I "ll develop for years , assuming it will be successful , because this time I was wise enough to select something that I want to use myself for the years to come .
I stopped the development of Hping when I quitted security , and I stopped the development of Jim when I quitted Tcl .
I 'm confident that I 'll not quit databases as it's ten years more or less that I 'm a MySQL user .
When you know you 'll need what you are doing for years to come there is a profund vision shift .
You think all your efforts are not wasted even if no one will want to use your code , and that likely your users will not be left alone in a few months .
So make a careful choice when starting the development of a new open source project , do n't pick something you are interested in , but something you 'll probably be interested in for the next decade .
Early adopters are vital for your project : the mass will not use what you build as long as there is n't a solid initial user base .
This sounds like the chicken or egg problem , but actually is not : there are smart guys that will be brave enough to use what you build if it 's worthwhile .
Your early adopters are not brave because they are irresponsible , just they can evaluate something without the need to follow the mass .
So where should you search for your early adopters ?
Among the smartest guys around .
To post your code on Hacker News once you have something that is complete enough to get an initial feeling is a good idea .
A wonderful side effect of all this is that at least on the initial stages you 'll have a terrific community .
I love people around Redis , they are in the average incredibly smart and interesting .
I enjoy when I provide help via the google group or when I try to fix bugs in very little time because with such a community it 's worth the efforts .
Users do n't like to read zillions of pages of documentation just to get started using your new open source project .
They do n't like compilation errors , nor complex ideas or protocols .
Your project should be trivial to run , and your documentation should includeinstructions about how to try an Hello World usage in a few trivial steps .
Once users will have a working hello world they 'll be willing to learn more , and read documentation , but not before most of the times .
If the libs you use are using are not included in debian / ubuntu apt - get and / or in mac os x package systems , it 's better to include the libs inside the code .
Your users should not need more than five minutes to go from the download to the working hello world usage example .
I suspect that the fact that Redis is one of the rare case of NoSQL database that will compile almost everywhere just with , that will run without a configuration with default settings just with , and that uses a simple enough protocol that you can understand and implement in minutes ( so that I could claim many client libs since the first weeks ) , is playing a very important Role in the relative good adoption Redis is experimenting considering how young it is .
Simplicity also matters in theyour users are required to understand to get started .
Redis is trivial but I 'm always surprised by the number of people that do n't get it .
I do n't even want to think about how hard is for the average user to understand a more complex NoSQL database .
Of course there are also people that told me they do n't like Redis because it 's too simple to be powerful enough for their use cases .
I do n't trust this argument , and anyway I think that is a good tradeoff , but be prepared to hear this kind of arguments if you take the simplicity path .
It 's very hard to understand if a user request should or should not be implemented .
It 's not a matter of development time : I mean that even if the feature request provides a patch , maybe the right thing to do is to not merge .
Every user has his specific needs .
They are legitimate from the point of view of the user , but possibly they are not legitimate from the point of view of the project : maybe there are other ways to solve the problem , or the problem in the first instance is a result of a design error the user is doing .
Many times it 's just that the feature request is too particular and specific : it 's something legitimate but that 1/1000 of users will actually need , but still the feature adds complexity and code to your project .
To say no to this feature requests is almost always the right thing to do .
Other times you instead feel like the feature request is ok , general enough , not too hard to implement , and there are no good ways to address the problem in some other way : this may be a good feature to implement , and yet it is a good idea to wait a a few weeks at least , to see if after some time the addition appears to be still good .
Basically every non trivial feature should stay in the TODO list some time before to get implemented .
Real programmers love to solve hard problems , so it 's easy to fall in the trap of implementing what 's the most fun to code instead of implementing what 's useful .
Actually if you love the problem domain , most things will be fun to code in the end , but to get the roadmap wrong is a huge mistake .
For instance I was quite convinced to implement redis- cluster ( a layer that gives automatic sharding and fault tolerance among N nodes ) as it is a very interesting problem to solve .
There is to study new things and possibly design some new algorithm variant that will work well with the Redis semantic and data model .
But actually most people in the short time will need much more the ability to use datasets bigger than RAM , that is , the Virtual Memory feature .
I changed the plans and I 'm going to work on VM in all the first part of 2010 , this means that most people will have a very simpler upgrade path once their datasets will be bigger ( assuming accesses are not evenly distributed ) .
Even if redis - cluster is nice and will be the next big thing after VM to get inside Redis , this is not as important for most users .
To implement one or the other feature before can change the users feeling about your project , so here the rule is , solve problems accordingly to the number of people that will benefit from the new implementations .
There is a fable in the open source world , that you get a lot of code once you start to have an user base .
This is not how it works : be prepared to write 95 % of the code of your project for the first .
There will be somebody that will contribute code actually , but most of the times this code will be about features you do n't want to implement , or will not look like sane enough to be merged without a profound review , or will solve a good problem in a way that is not general enough , or simply the coder does not understand enough of the Redis internals or about your future plans to provide an implementation that is acceptable .
From time to time actually it 's possible to merge a patch as it is , but this is rare .
The idea of " let 's implement a solid base so that other programmers will build all the rest " will not ever work .
If you are going to develop something that targets not just end users but companies , BSD can be the best pick , as in many business environments it 's much more comfortable to use code with a license that allows for internal developments without to deal with distribution of the changes .
Most of the time it's not that this companies do n't want to share their changes with the rest of the community , but that this changes are not ready for prime time or well documented , or may show too many things about corporate secrets , and so forth .
The good thing is that , you 'll be free to provide a closed source version of your project for instance , even if you accept external patches .
This can be a viable business model in many ways : the commercial version can only include things that are marginally useful for most users , but that are important in corporate environments , or may have special features that are too specific to get inside the " real " project but that it's ok to support commercially , and so forth .
Basically the BSD license doesmean that it will be impossible to do business with your project , but your users can be much more comfortable using something that can't experience problems similar to the ones MySQL experienced lately .

We recently highlighted a few ways to pamper your dishwasher to make it last longer , but refrigerators need a little TLC , too .
Here 's some maintenance tips to keep yours humming along smoothly .

The appliance specialists at Warners ' Stellian home appliance blog say that many refrigerator maintenance and repair tasks do n't need an expensive house call by a repairman .
In fact , one of the most common fridge ailments — a loose rubber gasket — can be easily fixed with a household hack .
To know if yours is loose , keep an eye on the condensation that forms on the outside of the refrigerator .
If you see more condensation than normal , check the seal ( or gasket as we appliance nerds call it ) for any obstructions and clear them .
If there are n't any , try moistening the gasket with Vaseline .
Seriously , it works .
If you do n't have any petroleum jelly , I 've used Neosporin in a pinch ( What wo n't that stuff do , honestly ? ) .

The post also delves into some good maintenance tips to keep in mind , like making sure you change your water filter on a regular basis .
When you 're ready to clean your fridge 's coils ( also important for extending the life of your appliance ) , be sure to check out the ideas we 've mentioned previously .

Refrigerator Seal & Fridge Maintenance [ Warners ' Stellian Blog ]
We 've written previously about the game Evony , for which we received a number of spam comments last July .
We 've also written about Bruce Everiss , the UK blogger who runs the site Bruce On Games , and the threat by Evony , LLC , a Delaware corporation which claims to be the maker or owner of the game , to sue Bruce for libel .
That threat has now come to pass .
Despite indications that , at the time Bruce began posting about Evony , stung by the same spam comments that hit us , Evony was owned by a Chinese gold - farming company known as UMGE , the suit against Mister Everiss is being pressed in New South Wales , Australia of all places .
When we wrote about the situation earlier , we speculated as to whether Australian libel or defamation laws are even more lax than those prevailing in the United Kingdom , which is notorious for its plaintiff friendliness .
We have short attention spans , and let the matter go .
But today Bruce Everiss returned to our humble site , posting a link asking for help against Evony , LLC .
( Whether you wish to help him or not is up to you . )
But Evony , LLC 's press release about the suit raises a few concerns .
Who actually owns Evony , the game , and who on earth is Benjamin Gifford ?
We think that computer and videogames are a trivial hobby , of little importance in the grand scheme of things , but consider free speech , potential legal forum abuse , and corporate quashing of potentially legitimate criticism to be very important indeed .
In virtually all press coverage of this story , about a corporation suing a blogger who criticized its product , this quote from Benjamin Gifford , a director of Evony , LLC , has appeared :
Mr. Everiss ' attempts to spread his patently false charges to others in the online community cannot be allowed to go unanswered , " said Benjamin Gifford , vice development director for the legal IP strategic division for Evony LLC .
" In the digital age in which we now live , online journalists and bloggers – and the traditional media outlets that may rely upon them as sources – must strive for a higher standard of integrity and accuracy .
Mr. Everiss ' complete disregard for even the most basic tenets of journalistic responsibility have left our company no alternative but to take these legal actions .
We hope now , in facing the full light of day before the Supreme Court , that Mr. Everiss will finally come clean and clear the record .
Like Bruce Everiss , we thought that Evony , the game , was owned by UMGE , a Chinese company that specializes in selling " virtual gold " to players of World of Warcraft and similar games , rather than Evony , LLC , which has been described elsewhere as a Delaware corporation .
Chinese " gold farmers " are notorious internet spammers , one of Mister Everiss 's principal complaints about Evony .
And as it turns out , at the time Everiss made his allegedly defamatory statements about Evony , the game , Evony , LLC , the American corporation which now claims to own the game , did n't even exist .
Everiss 's allegedly defamatory statements were made on July 10 , 2009 .
According to the records of the Delaware Secretary of State , Evony , LLC was n't a corporation on July 10 , 2009 .
The corporation was formed on July 22 , 2009 .
Now , it may be pure coincidence that Evony , LLC , an American corporation , formed twelve days after Bruce Everiss allegedly defamed Evony , the game .
Products change hands and new owners form corporations all the time .
Or it may not be a coincidence .
Delaware is the forum of choice for incorporation around the world for a reason .
Its laws are notoriously friendly to corporations that really have nothing to do with Delaware , and getting records or discovery from a Delaware corporation can be very difficult indeed .
In an Australian court , doing so might be even more difficult , as that would require transnational court orders , prohibitively expensive for a hypothetical defendant in the United Kingdom who might be required to retain lawyers in Australia and Delaware if he wished to know who was really suing him .
And then comes the question of why this Delaware corporation has a vice director , Benjamin Gifford , who appears to be jointly employed by Evony , LLC , and another , sort of murky entity , known as Assist Strategic Business Solutions , which has a mailing address at PO Box 126 , Miranda , NSW , Australia , 2228 .
According to his Linkedin profile ( no longer available but cached here ) , Benjamin Gifford , in the greater Sidney Australia area , is indeed the " Vice Development Director " of Evony , LLC , the Delaware corporation formed twelve days after Bruce Everiss allegedly defamed Evony the game .
And if one searches Google for " Benjamin Gifford " and Evony , one finds Benjamin Gifford 's Facebook page .
Note that Benjamin Gifford 's " services " include Assist Strategic Business Solutions Pty Limited .
According to Facebook , again , Assist Strategic Business Solutions has exactly one fan , and that fan is Benjamin Gifford .
So we 'll take it as read that Benjamin Gifford works for Evony , LLC , the Delaware corporation , in computer games , and Assist Strategic Business Solutions , also in computer games .
Except that Assist Strategic Business Solutions is n't a computer gaming company .
It 's a … well , I 'm not sure what it is .
And I 'm not sure what Benjamin Gifford does .
He certainly does n't seem to have a background in computer and videogame development .
While a military background in problem - solving may be as valued in the gaming industry as proficiency in , say , PERL or Visual Basic , most game industry job postings tend toward the second category .
Although Assist Business Solutions is very close to Evony 's law firm and its principal lawyer , Dean Groundwater .
Just down the road , in fact :
So that may explain why Evony , LLC , which incorporated a world away twelve days after Bruce Everiss allegedly defamed its product , chose to sue Everiss in New South Wales , rather than Delaware , or the United Kingdom , or China for that matter .
The game was purchased by Australians from … somebody … not a Chinese " gold farming " and spamming operation , nosirree .
Except , wait , Assist Business Solutions , and Benjamin Gifford , were working with something called Evony , LLC before the corporation ever formed .
Now , I 'm no cynic , and only a cynic would suggest this , and so I 'm not suggesting it :
But a cynic might assume that the real owners of Evony , the game that according to Bruce Everiss advertises itself through tasteless breast shots and spam , chose to sue Bruce Everiss in Australia on the advice of Benjamin Gifford , a consultant employed to help the company develop its tasteless marketing and to quash criticism from journalists and bloggers like Bruce Everiss .
Of course , I do n't suggest that .
And I do n't suggest that Evony , LLC , which formed twelve days after Everiss 's alleged defamation , has nothing to do with Delaware , or Australia , and that the sole purpose of this suit is to bankrupt Everiss by requiring him to fly around the world in order to defend himself from baseless allegations of libel and defamation by Evony 's real owners , who pardon me , may not speak English so well , wherever they may be .
I do n't suggest that at all .
Update :
On the spam front , this depicts the top results from a Twitter search for Evony conducted at 2:15 pm , Eastern time , today :
That link , by the way , does not point to this post .
I would n't enter it into my browser for all the tea in China .

Researchers have discovered that teenagers have very acute perceptions of risk .
Other researchers have discovered that retail employees are incredibly successful thieves .
These researchers should talk to each other !
1. Health researchers did a big survey of teenagers and their " perception of risk . "
Most said smoking a pack or two of cigarettes a day was pretty risky , but far fewer thought getting drunk once a week or smoking weed once a month was very risky .
Which is absolutely accurate , contrary to the general tone of this lame - o news story !
Teenagers know exactly what they can get away with .
2 . Who 's stealing all the shit that gets stolen from big retail stores ?
The crooked - ass teen and post - teen employees : " larcenous employees averaged $ 1,890 in theft , compared with $ 438 for shoplifters . "
3 . Kids these days !

Remember when the wingnuts accused sites like Daily Kos of allowing hostile comments on their sites ?
Who was that again ?
Bill O'Reilly ?
Why yes , yes it was .
I guess " It is time to shoot them all " is meant as an overture of civility .
With ClusterFoxers like this , who needs Beck ?
And yes , my source is notifying the Secret Service .
At any rate , I think I might have worked out what Mr Gogarty must be driving at : the cuts are wrong in so far as they severely penalise those who bear no responsibility for the Government ’s incompetence and mismanagement , but they are necessary in that they keep Mr Gogarty earning approximately € 120,000 a year and the Green party in power propping up the same incompetent government .
I apologise in advance for my unparliamentary language — and I hope he will take this on the chin for the country — but fuck Paul Gogarty .
And fuck the Green party .
Again , my profuse apologies for the unparliamentary nature of what I ’ve just said .
I ’ve become a little thin - skinned about suffering cringe - making , self - serving rationalisation from Green Party deputies .

If you do n't have access to a medical professional and you must deliver a baby yourself , start by sanitizing your arms and hands with either antimicrobial soap and warm water , rubbing alcohol , or an alcohol - based hand sanitizer .
Next , help the mother into whatever position is most comfortable for her , like squatting , which can open up the birth canal and help things along , or being on all - fours , which can ease back pain .
Do n't have her lie on her back unless she wants to .
Try to keep her calm throughout all of this by encouraging her to breathe and speaking in a low , soothing voice .
Once she starts pushing and the baby emerges , use your hands to support its head , but make sure you do n't pull on the baby or the umbilical cord .
Continue reading to learn what you need to do once the baby has emerged and how to handle complications .
There 's a little Cuban restaurant in Los Angeles called Versailles , and it's there that I fell in love with a folksy stew called ropa vieja , or " old rags , " given the appearance of the shredded beef prominently featured in this dish .
Ropa vieja is roughly a Cuban equivalent to our traditional meat - and - potatoes beef stew , minus the gravy and potatoes but with wine and peppers .
It 's a food of the people - the heart - warming , belly - filling sort of staple that , as my Google search indicated , everyone and her mother and Emeril Lagasse apparently make a version of .
I wanted to replicate the dish at home and concocted my own version using some reason and deduction .
Traditionally , ropa vieja features beef , onions , peppers , tomatoes , wine and garlic .
Although I 've made the dish with beef , this recipe was spawned during my vegan days , and I still like to fall back on the seitan version .
I love the way the seitan soaks up the flavor of the broth .
Two more inspirations found their way into this ropa vieja recipe .
I like wine , and I like garlic .
Maybe it's the French in me , but I knew my version would need both of these things in large quantities .
Whenever I cook with wine , I can't help but remember my favorite Julia Child quote : " I cook with wine ; sometimes I even add it to the food . "
This recipe calls for about half a bottle of wine ; I 'll leave the amount to your discretion .
As for the two heads of garlic , I guarantee you 'll have no vampires dropping by this Halloween .
Seitan Ropa Vieja ( " Old Rags " )
( or , a Vampire - Repelling Cuban Vegan Tribute to Julia Child )
Try making your own seitan using your favorite recipe or the one in Isa Moskowitz 's Vegan with a Vengeance , available free on her Post - Punk Kitchen website .
Homemade seitan is cheaper than buying prepackaged , and the flavor and texture are incomparable .
Vital wheat gluten can be found at natural food stores or even Woodman 's ( which carries the Bob 's Red Mill brand ) .
If you are a diehard carnivore , this dish is fantastic in its original form with shredded beef : Brown a three - pound chuck roast ( whole ) , then boil the meat for a few hours until tender .
Cool and shred the meat to use in place of the seitan .
Like most stews , it 's even better the day after .
one batch of homemade seitan , or 2 8 - ounce packages of seitan
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 green bell peppers , sliced
1 red bell pepper , sliced
2 yellow onions , sliced
2 heads of garlic , roasted ( see recipe )
1 tablespoon cumin
1 tablespoon oregano
1 - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon coriander
dash of turmeric
dash of cinnamon
28 - ounce can plus 15 - ounce can chopped tomatoes
2 cups dry red wine ( Chilean wines work well )
3 bay leaves
Chop seitan into bite - size pieces ; set aside .
To roast garlic , preheat oven to 375 degrees .
Chop the ends off the garlic and drizzle with olive oil .
Wrap the heads in foil and bake for 40 - 45 min. until soft and fragrant .
Once cooled , pop out cloves and mash into a paste .
Set aside .
In a large stockpot , heat olive oil over medium heat .
Add onions , peppers and cook about 15 min. until browned and softened .
Add garlic , spices ( except bay leaves ) and stir for 1 - 2 min .
Add seitan , tomatoes , wine and bay leaves and bring to boil .
Turn down heat to medium - low and simmer , partially covered , for 45 min .
Add more liquid as needed to maintain desired consistency .
Serve over rice .
Serves 8 - 10 .

Well , we already knew that torture apologist Andrea Tantaros is a good fit at Fox News , since she is eager to transmit the right - wing talking point du jour -- no matter how scummy or stupid -- with gusto .
She did it again yesterday on The O'Reilly Factor , debating with Alan Colmes over the political fallout from the failed bombing of Flight 253 on Christmas Day .
Tantaros trotted out every cheap rhetorical trick in the book -- suggesting that the right - wing attacks on Obama were a matter of " checking the baggage " of the administration and bringing up Van Jones , then comparing Obama to Tiger Woods -- in order to promote the right 's favorite new talking point : Obama and the Democrats are n't serious about combating terrorism .
Fortunately , Colmes delivered a righteous smackdown of this kind of cheap smear :
Tantaros :
But the point now is that we cannot discount this , we can not use terms like ' manmade disaster ' and go after -- it seems like this administration is more interested in going after Republicans , and going after the previous administration , than going after our real enemies .
When you say , ' Do n't blame Barack Obama ' -- Colmes :
That is an outrageous smear , an outrageous smear against an administration that 's trying to do the right thing , that cares about this country .
The implication that this administration or Democrats do n't love America , do n't want to protect America , do n't want to protect the American people -- that 's an outrageous smear against Democrats .
Tantaros : Alan , I do n't blame just Barack Obama , like you said , Alan .
I blame you , I blame Nancy Pelosi , and I blame the left and the liberals who are trying to weaken our country .
I really do wonder when the Fox talkers are finally going to bring up the issue of how the Bush administration responded in 2001 to a nearly identical attack .
My guess is never .
At a glance , the far corner of the main floor of J&R Music looks familiar to anybody old enough to have scratched a record by accident .
There are cardboard boxes filled with albums by the likes of Miles Davis and the Beach Boys that could be stacked in any musty attic in America .
But this is no music morgue ; it is more like a life - support unit for an entertainment medium that has managed to avoid extinction , despite numerous predictions to the contrary .
The bins above the boxes hold new records  freshly pressed albums of classic rock as well as vinyl versions of the latest releases from hip - hop icons like 50 Cent and Diddy and new pop stars like Norah Jones and Lady Gaga .
And with the curious resurgence of vinyl , a parallel revival has emerged :
The turntable , once thought to have taken up obsolescence with reel - to - reel and eight - track tape players , has been reborn .
J&R Music , at 23 Park Row southeast of City Hall Park , now carries 21 different turntables at prices ranging from $ 85 to $ 875 .
Some are traditional analog record players ; others are designed to connect to computers for converting music to digital files .

This saves us a grand total of nine keypresses ( including having to hit shift one less time . )
More importantly it saves us having to use double quotes at all .
This is really useful when you 're already using the quotes for something else .
For example , running a Perl one - liner remotely with ssh : With 5.10 on the remote machine this becomes just :
This has not only the advantage of saving me a bunch of keystrokes , but also doens't make me think as much .
And the less I have to think , the less chance I 'm going to do something stupid and make a mistake .

NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED
=====================
Goldline International , Inc. Naive New Investor down $ 1600 New Castle , Pennsylvania
I can not believe how stupid I was .
I thought " how could I be mislead by Glenn Beck , Fred Thompson and Marvin Levin ? "
Unfortunantly I did my homework after the test .
If I had done a simple web search , I would have found the stories about this company instead of reading my own in their stories .
I contacted Goldline because of the advertisement by Glenn Beck .
I found both Marvin Levin and Fred Thompson as satisfied customers .
Why would I doubt the company 's reputation if they recommended them ?
The answer to that question is , I suspect , they have a lot more to invest and probably are treated differently .
( Or maybe Goldline 's system of paying the selling commission up front works for them . )
Basically , I was pursuaded to buy Swiss Francs ( " That had just become available and were such a good deal " ) .
From reading the stories on - line I realize they just get a larger commission on them .
I was strongly encouraged to invest between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 by my " investment advisor . "
Luckily , I only had $ 5000 currently available .
I was warned about the gold confiscation ( whatever that was ) and told they would be behind me from buying to selling etc .
I was horrified to find from one of the other stories that their " buy back " price is low .
I can wait till I sell them for that news , I have had enough bad news right now .
After my purchase I was sent a thank you with a hand written note saying that my " financial advisor " was impressed with how I handled my investments .
I can not believe I was stupid enough to tell them all about all of my finances .
But again , how could Glenn Beck mislead me ?
They must be reputable .
After I made the purchase , I finally did my homework and found that the coins I had purchases for $ 318 each could be bought for $ 208 - $ 218 each on other sites .
I spend over $ 5000 to get coins worth $ 3520 at most .
As others have pointed out over a 30 % mark up .
I called my " advisor " and got the same story everyone else does - we are saving you money when you sell them because you have already paid the commission up front etc .
I ended the conversation saying I needed to do a little homework .
That is when I found this site and read my story .
I just called back to find out if I can get a refund - which I can not even though I only received the coins two days ago .
Apparently , the money back guarantee is from the date of purchase , not the day of delivery .
The only solice I have is that I did not make more purchases and if I wait long enough ( how many years I do n't know ) I might make my money back .
In all fairness , they said I should count on holding my coins for 5 - 6 years , so we will see .
Just be aware of the fact that I heard almost all the same lines everyone else did .
I had never purchased any gold so I was a sitting duck .
I blame myself for my naivity and getting caught up in the moment .
Perhaps this plan works for very large investors but for people like myself , it was not a good idea .
I will , as one of the others stated , continue to buy gold but I am now a more educated investor .
I am not saying they did anything illegal but I would not recommend anyone else deal with them .
" These suckers are cheesy , greasy , and spicy : that perfect trifecta . "
Kimchi plus melted cheese and tortillas — this should n't work .
It does n't even sound that appealing .
I told fellow Dinner Tonight contributor Blake about this recipe and he looked at me like I had just committed some kind of heinous crime .
The kimchi is sauteed with butter (! ) until it gets just the slightest bit crispy .
Then it 's mixed with a couple handfuls of cheese and a heavy sprinkle of sesame seeds .
The fact that this does n't just blow up from pure evil is beyond me .
But wait — your fears will melt away when I tell you this recipe came from Roy Choi , the man behind the Kogi BBQ truck and was printed in the October issue of Gourmet .
Feel better , now ?
Though I have n't eaten at this mobile eatery in Los Angeles , I can't stop thinking about it .
Korean and Mexican are two cuisines that I cook often , yet have never combined in such an interesting and dramatic way as they are done here .
It 's spicy and crunchy , with a wonderful nutty aroma from all the sesame seeds .
It 's also a tad cheesy , but that can easily be corrected .
It makes for a hilarious dinner but to be perfectly honest , what really crossed my mind was how wonderful it would taste as a drunken snack .
See these suckers are cheesy , greasy , and spicy : that perfect trifecta that only gets better the more drinks you have .
Yesterday , the IANA allocated two / 8s to the Asia - Pacifc region ( the blocks in question are 1/8 and 27/8 ) .
Now , only 24 / 8s ( 9.3 % ) are available .
Last year , the " n=1 " proposal was adopted .
This proposal sets aside one / 8 for each of the five Regional Internet Registries .
If this proposal is taken into account , only 7.4 % of the IP v4 free pool is available .
Welcome to 2010 .

Spending government money on road construction does nothing to lower local unemployment , a massive new study of 700 counties by the AP shows .
There is no difference in unemployment trends between counties that received the most stimulus money and the group that received none .
The myth of the government spending money on road construction to fight unemployment seems to be based on inaccurate memories of the public works projects of the Great Depression rather than fact .
Marshall country in Tennessee received more road money than almost any other county in America .
Unemployment there is heading toward 20 % .
" As a policy tool for creating jobs , this does n't seem to have much bite , " said Emory University economist Thomas Smith , who supported the stimulus and reviewed AP 's analysis .
So why is the government spending so much money creating jobs ?
The government has already spent over $ 20 billion for road construction and is now considering a $ 75 billion second stimulus bill .
Much of that would likely be spent on construction projects .
The simplest answer for this myth is that the private construction companies that build roads are excellent lobbyists and the efforts to increase government spending on these projects have huge payoffs .
In most areas , there are few companies that can bid on the projects .
Few bidders means that each construction company stands a decent chance of receiving a government payoff .
Here 's the full write - up of the study from the AP :
Ten months into President Barack Obama 's first economic stimulus plan , a surge in spending on roads and bridges has had no effect on local unemployment and only barely helped the beleaguered construction industry , an Associated Press analysis has found .
Spend a lot or spend nothing at all , it did n't matter , the AP analysis showed : Local unemployment rates rose and fell regardless of how much stimulus money Washington poured out for transportation , raising questions about Obama 's argument that more road money would address an " urgent need to accelerate job growth . "
Obama wants a second stimulus bill from Congress that relies in part on more road and bridge spending , projects the president said are " at the heart of our effort to accelerate job growth . "
Construction spending would be a key part of the Jobs for Main Street Act , a $ 75 billion second stimulus to revive the nation 's lethargic unemployment rate and improve the dismal job market for construction workers .
The House approved the bill 217 - 212 last month after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , worked the floor for an hour ; the Senate is expected to consider it later in January .
AP 's analysis , which was reviewed by independent economists at five universities , showed that strategy has n't affected unemployment rates so far .
And there 's concern it wo n't work the second time .
For its analysis , the AP examined the effects of road and bridge spending in communities on local unemployment ; it did not try to measure results of the broader aid that also was in the first stimulus like tax cuts , unemployment benefits or money for states .
" My bottom line is , I 'd be skeptical about putting too much more money into a second stimulus until we 've seen broader effects from the first stimulus , " said Aaron Jackson , a Bentley University economist who reviewed AP 's analysis .
Even within the construction industry , which stood to benefit most from transportation money , the AP 's analysis found there was nearly no connection between stimulus money and the number of construction workers hired or fired since Congress passed the recovery program .
The effect was so small , one economist compared it to trying to move the Empire State Building by pushing against it .
" As a policy tool for creating jobs , this does n't seem to have much bite , " said Emory University economist Thomas Smith , who supported the stimulus and reviewed AP 's analysis .
" In terms of creating jobs , it does n't seem like it 's created very many .
It may well be employing lots of people but those two things are very different . "
Transportation spending is too small of a pebble to quickly create waves in the nation 's $ 14 trillion economy .
And starting a road project , even one considered " shovel ready , " can take many months , meaning any modest effects of a second burst of transportation spending are unlikely to be felt for some time .
" It would be unlikely that even $ 20 billion spent all at once would be enough to move the needle of the huge decline we 've seen , even in construction , much less the economy .
The job destruction is way too big , " said Kenneth D. Simonson , chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America .
Few counties , for example , received more road money per capita than Marshall County , Tenn. , about 90 minutes south of Nashville .
Obama 's stimulus is paying the salaries of dozens of workers , but local officials said the unemployment rate continues to rise and is expected to top 20 percent soon .
The new money for road projects is n't enough to offset the thousands of local jobs lost from the closing of manufacturing plants and automotive parts suppliers .
" The stimulus has not benefited the working - class people of Marshall County at all , " said Isaac Zimmerle , a local contractor who has seen his construction business slowly dry up since 2008 .
That year , he built 30 homes .
But prospects this year look grim .
Construction contractors like Zimmerle would seem to be in line to benefit from the stimulus spending .
But money for road construction offers little relief to most contractors who do n't work on transportation projects , a niche that requires expensive , heavy equipment that most residential and commercial builders do n't own .
Residential and commercial building make up the bulk of the nation 's construction industry .
" The problem we 're seeing is , unfortunately , when they put those projects out to bid , there are only a handful of companies able to compete for it , " Zimmerle said .
The Obama administration has argued that it 's unfair to count construction jobs in any one county because workers travel between counties for jobs .
So , the AP looked at a much larger universe :
The more than 700 counties that got the most stimulus money per capita for road construction , and the more than 700 counties that received no money at all .
For its analysis , the AP reviewed Transportation Department data on more than $ 21 billion in stimulus projects in every state and Washington , D.C. , and the Labor Department 's monthly unemployment data .
Working with economists and statisticians , the AP performed statistical tests to gauge the effect of transportation spending on employment activity .
There was no difference in unemployment trends between the group of counties that received the most stimulus money and the group that received none , the analysis found .
Despite the disconnect , Congress is moving quickly to give Obama the road money he requested .
The Senate will soon consider a proposal that would direct nearly $ 28 billion more on roads and bridges , programs that are popular with politicians , lobbyists and voters .
The overall price tag on the bill , which also would pay for water projects , school repairs and jobs for teachers , firefighters and police officers , would be $ 75 billion .
" We have a ton of need for repairing our national infrastructure and a ton of unemployed workers to do it .
Marrying those two concepts strikes me as good stimulus and good policy , " White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein said .
" When you invest in this kind of infrastructure , you 're creating good jobs for people who need them . "
Highway projects have been the public face of the president 's recovery efforts , providing the backdrop for news conferences with workers who owe their paychecks to the stimulus .
But those anecdotes have not added up to a national trend and have not markedly improved the country 's broad employment picture .
The stimulus has produced jobs .
A growing body of economic evidence suggests that government programs , including Obama 's $ 700 billion bank bailout program and his $ 787 billion stimulus , have helped ease the recession .
A Rutgers University study on Friday , for instance , found that all stimulus efforts have slowed the rise in unemployment in many states .
But the 400 - page stimulus law contains so many provisions — tax cuts , unemployment benefits , food stamps , state aid , military spending — economists agree that it 's nearly impossible to determine what worked best and replicate it .
It 's also impossible to quantify exactly what effect the stimulus has had on job creation , although Obama points to estimates that credit the recovery program for creating or saving 1.6 million jobs .
Politically , singling out transportation for another round of spending is an easier sell than many of the other programs in the stimulus .
The money can be spent quickly and provides a tangible payoff .
Even some Republicans who have criticized the stimulus have said they want more transportation spending .
Spending money on roads also ripples through the economy better than other spending because it improves the nation 's infrastructure , said Bernstein , the White House economist .
But that 's a policy argument , not a stimulus argument , said Daniel Seiver , an economist at San Diego State University who reviewed AP 's analysis .
" Infrastructure spending does have a long - term payoff , but in terms of an immediate impact on construction jobs it does n't seem to be showing up , " Seiver said .
" A program like this may be justified but it's not going to have an immediate effect of putting people back to work . "
If you sleep like a princess , and wonder what keeps you tossing and turning at night , perhaps there 's a gadget that can find the pea under your mattress .
Companies have begun selling electronics directly to consumers that can help anyone monitor their sleep and adjust their bedtime routine , and some people have invented their own tracking systems .
Slip on a wireless wristband or headband and focus your camcorder before you hit the sack , and the next morning you 'll wake up to a mound of data .
At a Quantified Self meetup at Wired 's San Francisco offices Dec. 7 , around 100 people gathered to share their data - driven sleep habits .
The founders of the Wakemate startup were on hand to talk about their wristband that keeps track of your sleep patterns .
It 's equipped with an accelerometer and a Bluetooth transmitter that connects with a free smartphone app .
The accelerometer is the same one that 's in the highly popular ( and backordered ) Fitbit exercise tracking device .
The Wakemate will be very hackable and cost just $ 50 , but wo n't ship until January .
So , if it 's a Christmas gift for a sleepy friend you 're after , you might want to check out the Zeo Personal Sleep Coach , an alarm clock that records electrical signals from your brain with a headband .
In the morning , it returns a chart of how much time you spent in light , deep and REM sleep , as well as a personal sleep score ( which they call your ZQ ) .
It can also make waking up easier to wake you if you ask it to , by choosing a lighter sleep moment to rouse you .
Techology investor Esther Dyson gave the Zeo a mixed review at the meetup .
For example , the headband has little pads that wear out quickly , and must be replaced .
But the biggest problems are on the software side : Zeo does not allow more than one user to share the device , and makes it hard to extract the raw data .
Despite those flaws , Dyson said she plans to experiment with it some more .
If you want an even better picture of your sleep , you can follow the example of San Francisco resident , Matt Bell .
After years of feeling drowsy all day and not knowing why , he set up a bedside camcorder with an infrared illuminator in search of an answer .
The footage was revealing .
" The biggest thing that surprised me was seeing how much I moved around while sleeping , " Bell said at the meetup .
" It was fascinating to glimpse at the workings of this hidden unconscious world that occupies close to a third of our lives . "

A number of opposition figures have been arrested in Iran , a day after at least eight people died during the most violent protests for months .
Those detained include senior aides to opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi , and a former foreign minister .
Mr Mousavi 's nephew was among those killed on Sunday .
Officials deny opposition claims police shot them .
US President Barack Obama has condemned the crackdown and urged Iran to release those " unjustly detained " immediately .
State media forensic tests were being carried out on the body of Mr Mousavi 's nephew , Seyed Ali Mousavi , and the four other people killed on Sunday , preventing the rapid burials that are usual under Islamic tradition .
The bodies had been " retained in order to complete forensic and police examinations and find more leads on this suspicious incident " , the Irna news agency reported .
RECENT UNREST IN IRAN 19 Dec : Influential dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri dies aged 87 21 Dec :
Tens of thousands attend his funeral in Qom ; reports of clashes between opposition supporters and security forces 22 Dec : Further confrontations reported in Qom 23 Dec : More clashes reported in city of Isfahan as memorial is held 24 Dec : Iran reportedly bans further memorial services for Montazeri except in his birthplace and Qom 26 Dec : Clashes reported in central and northern Tehran 27 Dec :
At least eight dead following anti-government protests in Tehran ; 300 reported arrested
World reacts to Iran violence The Mousavi family earlier said Seyed Ali's body had been taken without their permission from the hospital where it was being held .
Opposition sources said the body had been taken by government agents in order to prevent his funeral becoming a rallying point for more protests .
An opposition website , Norooz , said police had fired tear gas on Monday to disperse a group of Mousavi supporters who were demonstrating outside the hospital .
According to Mr Mousavi 's website , Seyed Ali Mousavi was shot in the back on Sunday as security forces fired on demonstrators in Tehran .
Intermittent protests in Iran following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's controversial re-election in June have represented the biggest challenge to the government since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Foreign media face severe restrictions in Iran , making reports hard to verify .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , reporting from London , says the government 's immediate response to the latest confrontation has been to arrest senior opposition figures , as it did after protests against the disputed presidential elections in June .

The authorities are blaming troublemakers for the violence , our correspondent says , with the police suggesting that protesters may have shot each other .
The majority hardline block in the Iranian parliament called on " security and judiciary authorities to firmly deal with those who mock Ashura " , referring to the Shia Muslim festival that reached its climax on Sunday .
But members of the opposition believe Seyed Ali Mousavi was targeted by the government in an attempt to intimidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Our correspondent adds that the government will be doing itself no favours if it has taken his body because this would outrage religious conservatives , as well as the opposition .
' Shameless act '
Among those reported arrested on Monday were opposition politician Ebrahim Yazdi , a foreign minister after the 1979 revolution and now leader of the Freedom Movement of Iran , his nephew , Lily Tavasoli .
Ebrahim Yazdi , pictured in 2005 , was also arrested in June this year Mr Yazdi 's son Khalil , who lives in the US , told the BBC's World Today programme he believed the Iranian authorities wanted to close down all opposition groups .
" It is a shameless and irresponsible act , " he said .
" Any opposition now , they want to shut [ it ] down .
We 're going down a one - way street that 's now going downhill . "
The Parlemannews website reported that three aides to Mir Hossein Mousavi had been arrested .
It also named two aides to reformist former President Mohammad Khatami as being among those rounded up by the authorities .
Mousavi Tebrizi , a senior cleric from the holy city of Qom who is close to Mr Mousavi , is also reported to have been arrested , as is human - rights campaigner and journalist Emeddin Baghi .
International condemnation On Monday , state - owned English - language Press TV said eight people had died .
Earlier , Persian state television had reported at least 15 people killed .
The official death toll for Sunday 's confrontation is the highest since June , and police said about 300 people had been detained .
Unconfirmed reports , later denied by a local prosecutor , said four people also died in protests in the north - western city of Tabriz .
Clashes were also reported in Isfahan and Najafabad in central Iran and Shiraz in the south .
Moderate cleric Mehdi Karoubi , who came fourth in last June 's election , criticised Iran 's rulers for Sunday 's violence , an opposition website reported .
The US , the UK , France , Germany and Canada have all condemned the violence .
Mr Obama said the protests were not about the US but the " Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves " .
" The decision of Iran 's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not continue , " he said .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said it was " particularly disturbing to hear accounts of the lack of restraint by the security forces " on a day of religious commemoration .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the " unacceptable actions of the security forces " and urged Tehran to respect civil rights .
Iranian security forces have been on alert since influential dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri died a week ago aged 87 .
His funeral attracted tens of thousands of pro-reform supporters , many of whom shouted anti-government slogans .

In her working hours , Melissa G. King administered benefit funds for the sandhogs ’ union , associating with the muscled and plain - spoken men who blast through earth and darkness to build tunnels beneath the city .
But in her free time , she squired her teenage daughter to the nation ’s elite equestrian events , building a stable of horses that would be the envy of any on the horse - show circuit .
The two worlds could not be more disparate .
But to hear federal authorities tell it , she gained entry into one only by stealing from the other .
Ms. King , 58 , was charged last month with embezzling $ 42 million from the union ’s employee benefit funds over seven years .
Prosecutors said much of it was lavished on her personal life : more than $ 3 million in equestrian - related expenses , $ 7.3 million for American Express bills , $ 713,500 at a Southern California jewelry store and more than $ 300,000 at Neiman Marcus .

A guest post from Ryan O .
This post discusses some of our concerns about the global temperature data .
I hope to continue this or Ryan can down the road .
Ryan is took a brute force approach to looking at pre-homogenization trends of GHCN with a simple script .
I think you ’ll find the results interesting .
— — — — ———-
So lately , a lot of people have been musing about the accuracy of the temperature indices .
One of the oft - repeated things is that three independent indices ( CRU , GISS , NOAA ) all yield similar results .
This is presented as confirmation that they can not be that far off .
Of course , the world is not so simple .
All three indices depend in a large part on GHCN .
They are not independent .
If there is something wrong with GHCN , it will carry through to all three indices .
The “ raw ” data for GHCN consists of 13,472 stations .
You can download it here : ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v2/v2.mean.Z
Unpack using WinZip or similar ( I use 7 - Zip since it ’s free ) , import into Excel to be able to split the year from the station identifier , and save as a tab - delimited file .
At the end of this , I will provide a script that will read that tab - delimited file into R .
Of those 13,472 stations in GHCN , some go back as far as 1701 .
I arbitrarily selected 1900 as a cutoff date .
You are , of course , free to select other dates .
I then wanted to see what the data looked like .
To do this , I simply calculated anomalies using the period of 1900 - 2009 , averaged , and also plotted the station density .
That yields this graphic :
Of course , this looks quite hoaky ( and most of you knew it would ahead of time ) .
The reason for this is simple – you ca n’t calculate anomalies without figuring out offsets for records that are incomplete during the baseline period .
Note how the shape changes greatly as stations are added / deleted ( red line maxes at ~ 8,000 stations ) .
The purpose for showing this graph is to illustrate that , in order to use the greatest amount of data in the GHCN database , you MUST make adjustments .
There ’s nothing untoward about the fact that adjustments are made . . . if you want to work with anomalies and you want to use as much of the data as possible , you have to make adjustments .
However , you now have a problem :
How do you make the adjustments ?
To avoid this complication , I simply discarded all series that did not have at least 1,000 points since 1900 ( or about 80 % complete ) .
This allows me to compute anomalies using a common baseline , and it avoids the complication of having the geographical weight changing over time .
The locations in 1900 are the same as the locations in 2000 .
This wo n’t necessarily be representative of the whole world , as the network is heavily weighted toward US stations , but I ’m just taking an initial look and not trying to come up with my own index yet .
Just looking and thinking about what I see .
The 1,000 point cutoff yields 1,793 stations .
Unfortunately , there is still another problem .
A lot of stations dropped out after 1990 .
So unless I want to just look at 1900 – 1990 , I have to cull some more .
For this next cull , I required that from 1990 – 2009 , stations had to have at least 180 points ( or about 70 % complete ) .
That yields 894 stations .
You could use other numbers ; it does n’t change the results much .
Anyway . . . now that we have a group of long record length stations that are fairly complete , let ’s take a look at what we see ( red line maxes at ~ 890 stations ) :
Hmm .
Some interesting things to note .
First , the overall warming from 1900 is only about 0.22 Deg C/ Century , using the raw data .
Now , as stated before , this is not a geographically representative sample .
Would a representative sample yield another 1 Deg C of warming ?
Dunno .
What is certainly interesting about this sample is that it has the same general shape as CRU / GISS / NOAA – but the 1930 – 1980 decline is more pronounced and the 1980 – present rise is less pronounced .
Also note that a large number of stations still drop out in ~2006 .
In fact , there are only about 100 stations from 2006 – 2009 that also have 1,000 points since 1900 and 180 points since 1990 .
I am not sure why , but as we know this can affect the analysis , let ’s take a look at what happens if we just go through 2006 :
More hmm .
The warming trend is under a tenth of a degree C from 1900 and the 2006 point on the smooth is about the same as the 1936 point on the smooth .
Perhaps the drop off in stations is causing a problem ; perhaps not .
Not enough information in this analysis to tell .
So what does this mean ?
I do n’t know .
It certainly does n’t mean that the temperature indices are wrong because this is a really basic analysis that does not take into account geographical representation or station moves ( when the same station identifier was kept ) .
It also is interesting that the high warming trend is not present in this subset of raw GHCN data – meaning that , if the warming is due to adjustments , the three indices must be adjusting in very similar ways .
I have no thoughts on how likely that would be at the moment .
Regardless , it ’s interesting enough to make me want to dig deeper .
Maybe I will find that GISS / CRU / NOAA are fine .
Maybe not .
Either way , I ’m sure there will be more to come .
Script :
John King , a former Associated Press reporter , White House correspondent , Magic Wall operator , and consummate straight newsman , will be replacing opinionated anchor Lou Dobbs in the CNN's 7 p.m. time slot .
CNN doubles down on straight news
As rival cable networks cash in on commentary , CNN is betting big on straight news .
That was its message Thursday morning when it announced that John King — a former Associated Press reporter , White House correspondent , Magic Wall operator , and consummate straight newsman — would be replacing opinionated anchor Lou Dobbs in the network ’s 7 p.m. time slot .

Three decades after Ted Turner revolutionized television news with the launch of CNN , it ’s actually now viewed as counterintuitive for a cable network to commit more to straight news in the evening .
And King himself seems something of a throwback .
“ I think what is troubling in part of our business is you have people on news shows who start the conversation with a bias , ” King told POLTICO from Montana .
That he called from snowy Helena is telling .
It ’s the 44th state King ’s visited this year for his Sunday show , “ State of the Union ” and a testament to his belief that reporting is essential for breaking down the news on cable .
Currently CNN ’s chief national correspondent , King joined the network after 12 years with the Associated Press doing reporting the old fashioned way — in war zones and the campaign trail .
For the unnamed show , which launches early next year , King will be based in D.C. but plans to continue taking the nation ’s pulse from the road .
And , King says , he ’ll remain an honest broker during political debates among guests , regardless of what cable stars on the other networks may be doing .
“ I do n’t come to the table with an ideological bias , ” King said .
“ I ’m fascinated by all sides of these issues . ”
That is not necessarily a winning approach .
Last month , CNN ’s prime - time lineup — with Campbell Brown , Larry King and Anderson Cooper on the air from 8 to 11 p.m. — fell to fourth place in the key demographic of viewers ages 25 to 54 , according to Nielsen .
Fox
News continued its dominance in prime time , with MSNBC and sister network HLN also beating the cable news innovator .
King himself will not go head - to - head with an ideological competitor like Bill O’Reilly or Keith Olbermann .
The competition in his time slot consists of Fox ’s Shepard Smith , who hosts a traditional newscast before O’Reilly takes over at 8 p.m. , and a repeat of Chris Matthews ’s “ Hardball . ”
When it comes to ratings , putting King at 7 p.m. is really not that much of a gamble .
It ’s doubtful he can fare much worse against the competition .
Last month , Dobbs came in third place in total viewers ( 649,000 ) and fourth in the 25 - to - 54 demographic ( 163,000 ) .
By comparison , Smith racked up close to 2 million viewers , with 463,000 from that key audience .
The unhappy trend continued as the night went on .
From 8 to 11 p.m. , Brown , King and Cooper all finished third or fourth in the 25 - 54 demographic — far from the prime - time leaders .
At 8 p.m. , for instance , O’Reilly brought in more than five times as many viewers as Brown .
But the switch from Dobbs to King is n’t just about 7 p.m. in cableland .
It reflects CNN ’s much - stated mission , and it ’s a noble one .
But can it work ?
“ I applaud what they ’re doing , ” said veteran television journalist Sam Donaldson , ” but if I were an investor , I would n’t be holding my breath . ”
“ The trend — and is it going to reverse , I do n’t know — is toward opinion , ” Donaldson added .
Clearly , CNN president Jon Klein and his management team know that ’s the trend , or at least the conventional wisdom in the industry .
News of CNN ’s sagging prime - time ratings in October led to plenty of hand - wringing in media circles .
But Klein has consistently said that the network would remain committed to news over opinion , and King now serves as the missing piece in a line - up where Dobbs seemed out of step between Wolf Blitzer ’s “ Situation Room ” and Brown ’s 8 p.m. show .
“ The program will reflect what CNN is all about : straight facts from our anchors and the widest range of opinions from across the political spectrum , ” Klein said in a statement Thursday .
And in a memo to staff , he said that King “ embodies what we are striving for at CNN . ”
With nearly 30 years at CNN , Dobbs ’s outspoken views on issues like immigration were grandfathered into the schedule , not really fitting with where the network wanted to be headed .
Earlier this year , executives pushed Dobbs to do a more straightforward newscast , which worked for a while .
That is , until he began questioning whether President Barack Obama had really proved that he was born in Hawaii and was an American citizen .
Edward Alden , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , wrote on POLITICO ’s Arena Thursday that Dobbs 's presence represented “ a perversion of that mission , not because of his particular views but because the network never forced him to make a clear distinction between news reporting and his own ideological campaigning . ”
King , on the contrary , is respected among his peers as a straight news reporter , not an advocate .
Donaldson praised King ’s abilities and said that ABC twice tried hiring him over the years .
But he added that King “ is not going to do what the most successful shows on cable networks seem to be doing . ”
Jim Walton , president of CNN Worldwide , told the AP this week that the network ’s influence extends beyond the United States , and a hyper - partisan line - up could tarnish the news brand around the world .
“ We compete against a lot more than Fox and MSNBC , " Walton said .
Still , it ’s the U.S. ratings that are going to get the most attention , regardless of the fact that CNN remains a successful , and profitable worldwide news company .
And whether it ’s because the nation is more polarized than ever , or that viewers already get the day ’s news on cable , the Internet , or through their phone , it ’s questionable whether CNN can swing upstream against the current of opinion on competing networks .
Olbermann , MSNBC ’s outspoken 8 p.m. host , told the AP last month that CNN ’s model is out of date when it comes to how people consume news and information .
" CNN seems to still think it is the primary source for its viewers , that they know nothing until they tune in , " Olbermann said .
" This is , ever increasingly , nonsensical .
People now watch news on TV for elucidation and context and analysis .
They have brought the facts with them , the way we used to bring TV dinners . "
King would likely agree that viewers want “ elucidation and context and analysis . ”
In speaking with POLITICO , he mentioned the need for better explanation of the issues and “ peeling back the pages ” for viewers .
However , King said that can be done “ without shouting . ”
Management approached King just a few days ago about replacing Dobbs , there are few details of precisely what he plans to do .
But a goal , he said , is to “ play it straight , be objective , invite all sides in , but have a lively discussion . ”
While that sounds all well and good , Mark Jurkowitz , associate director for Pew ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism , asks , “ Can they bring value - added through this program ? ”
“ How fundamentally different is it going to be from “ The Situation Room " ?
Jurkowitz continued .
Still , Jurkowitz said there could easily be room for an “ intelligent , well - reported show that goes pretty deep into the day ’s news and tells you things you do n’t know . ”
And it ’s too early , he said , to write off the idea that nonpartisan news simply can’t work anymore after dinner .
“ Cable is too new a medium for everything to be etched in stone , ” he said .

Hey , looky there , this blog thing is still turned on .
Hi , my name is Jeremy and I use to blog a lot .
I ’m gonna try this here blogging thing out again and see what happens .
As those of you who follow me on Twitter know , I ’ve been working very furiously over the last couple weeks to jumpstart FubuMVC development and convert the Dovetail codebase over from our homegrown mess .
I ’ve effectively done a rewrite of the core MVC bits you can look at in the “ reboot ” branch at : http://fubumvc.googlecode.com/svn/branches/reboot.
As of yesterday we ’re running our new product at Dovetail on Fubu , I ’ve finally caught up on sleep , so now ’s the time to finally talk about what we ’ve been up to with FubuMVC .
There ’s self justification verbiage at top , and some technical details down below .
What is It ?
FubuMVC is a an open source framework for web development using the Model View Controller pattern ( like just about every other web development framework in existence minus WebForms ) .
Fubu is built in C# and depends on the System .
Web .
Routing subsystem of the base CLR , but has no dependency whatsoever on the ASP .
Net MVC framework .
FubuMVC is largely based on work and ideas that Chad Myers and I developed when we started at Dovetail last year as described in Our “ Opinions ” on the ASP .
Net MVC blog post and at KaizenConf .
Just to boil it down , we were n’t happy with the ASP .
Net MVC framework and wanted something that worked a bit differently .
In a section below I ’ll outline our differences with the MVC and try to explain why I think an entirely new MVC framework is fully justified .
Let me say this loudly and clearly upfront , I see FubuMVC as a “ long tail ” choice suitable for teams with ALT .
NET / code centric aesthetic rather than a full fledged competitor to Microsoft ’s MVC .
Let me ask you this , what ’s your favorite band and / or album ?
A lot of us casually like the least common denominator Top 40 stuff , but what band would you camp out to go see ?
I like a lot of kinds of music , but I ’m only passionate about the Alt Country scene in Texas – and that ’s definitely not a mainstream taste .
My point is this , I want Fubu ( “ for us , by us ” ) to be a tool that * I * love using rather than a tool that ’s widely used , but nobody is passionate about .
Design Philosophy & Goals
Composition over Inheritance .
SOLID , whatever .
I want it pluggable .
I want to be able to swap things in and out in the small .
I do NOT want Fubu to force goofy base class requirements down my throat .
IMHO , frameworks that depend on inheritance are difficult to work with outside of the basic scenarios and tend to couple your code very tightly to the framework .
I want Fubu MVC to largely stay out of my way .
Use Convention over Configuration as far as it can go .
We ’re heavily borrowing a page from Fluent NHibernate and StructureMap to allow you to create your own project specific conventions within FubuMVC – but also allow you to use explicit configuration to augment or override the conventions .
I love Ruby on Rails and all of its magic .
I love how it just seems so declarative .
I ’m working with C# , and trying to make C# do Ruby things is a first class ticket to hell .
We ’re endeavoring to use the strengths of C# and wring every single bit of advantage we can out of having strong typing and work with C# ’s strengths in the spirit of Rails without doing anything stupid like using C# as a bad Ruby .
Testability .
Controller actions should be cheap and easy to setup and verify the outcomes .
Reduce simple mistakes by tightly tying together controller actions , routes , and url resolution to prevent errors and DRY up the code
Use the “ One Model In , One Model Out ” philosophy for controller actions .
Minimize repetitive noise code .
Reduce code clutter .
Minimize or eliminate the usage of attributes .
Make the code easily traceable or “ ReSharperable ” as I like to say .
Enable IoC tools to be fully utilized all the way up and down the runtime pipeline – making it relatively easy to scope services and resources throughout the request .
In the Fubu model , every single piece of the runtime pipeline is retrieved with a single service locator call ( except things like WebForms controls , but at least you can intercept the construction to do things like transparently calling your Container .
BuildUp ( ) against the objects without resorting to base classes ) .
Right now , Jimmy Bogard is basically blogging one nonstop commercial for this line of thought .
Enabling IoC tool usage also means being IoC neutral as well as doing nothing that prevents you from utilizing the full power of your IoC ’s special registration abilities .
Many people out there right now are doing IoC abstractions for their frameworks – and most of them suck ( After talking to Rob last night , I think the Caliburn guys got it right ) .
The Common Service Locator is in there for one specific scenario in the Fubu core ( and I ’m tempted to rip it out ) , but other than that , it ’s Dependency Injection turtles all the way down .
At some point I ’m going to have to justify why Fubu is not built on top of the MVC framework .
It ’s a perfectly fair question .
The answer is that I do not believe that the goals above are achievable with the MVC framework .
I ’ll get specific if anybody wants , but at the end of the day it just comes down to wanting a runtime pipeline that works a different way .
I ’m happy to steal anything I like from the MVC framework and much of it will be happily usable with Fubu .
Behaviors and the Lifecycle of a Request
The key element to the FubuMVC lifecyle is the IActionBehavior interface that looks like this :
public interface IActionBehavior { void Invoke ( ) ; }
Pretty freaking cool , huh ?
One method , no arguments .
Remember that we ’re assuming in Fubu that everything that the real ActionBehavior objects need is injected in by an IoC container – even other ActionBehavior objects and abstracted reference to the HttpContext runtime .
I ’m assuming that most requests will be handled by more than one behavior at a time .
For convenience , we built a BasicBehavior base class you can start with :
public abstract class BasicBehavior : IActionBehavior { //
It feels dirty , but I ’m using Setter Injection here . // I do n’t remember why I did this .
Maybe Chad did it .
public IActionBehavior InsideBehavior { get ; set ; } public void Invoke ( ) { if ( performInvoke ( ) == DoNext .
Continue && InsideBehavior != null ) { InsideBehavior .
Invoke( ) ; } afterInsideBehavior ( ) ; } protected virtual DoNext performInvoke ( ) { return DoNext .
Continue ; } protected virtual void afterInsideBehavior ( ) { } }
Using the BasicBehavior allows you to do work before and / or after the inner behavior executes .
You can even stop the invocation of the next behavior by just not calling its Invoke ( ) method .
Note that you only have to implement the interface , not this particular base class .
Right now , we ’ve got these Behaviors ( some are Dovetail specific and some are junk stubs for testing ) :
Another key thing to understand about Fubu is that we put a specific RouteHandler on to each Route that knows how to locate and execute the correct ActionBehavior for that specific route .
That technical detail is what makes FubuMVC ’s design possible as well as making “ portable areas ” and “ slices ” and “ engines ” relatively easy to build .
Here ’s the basic sequence of events at the beginning of every request handled through FubuMVC :
The FubuRouteHandler at this point is pretty simple , it ’s just this :
public class FubuRouteHandler : IRouteHandler { private readonly Guid _behavior
Id ; private readonly IBehavior Factory _factory ; public FubuRouteHandler ( IBehaviorFactory factory , Guid behavior Id ) { _factory = factory ; _behavior Id = behavior Id ; } public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler ( RequestContext requestContext ) { var request = new RequestData( requestContext ) ; IActionBehavior behavior = GetBehavior ( request ) ; return new FubuHttpHandler ( behavior ) ; } public void Execute ( InMemoryRequestData data ) { IActionBehavior behavior = GetBehavior ( data ) ; behavior .
Invoke( ) ; } public IActionBehavior GetBehavior ( IRequestData request ) { return _factory .
BuildBehavior ( request , _behaviorId ) ; } public class FubuHttpHandler : IHttpHandler , IRequiresSessionState { private readonly IActionBehavior _behavior ; public FubuHttpHandler ( IActionBehavior behavior ) { _behavior = behavior ; } public void ProcessRequest ( HttpContext context ) { _behavior .
Invoke( ) ; } public bool IsReusable { get { return false ; } } } }
The “ _behaviorId ” Guid property of the RouteHandler is assumed to be the uniquely named instance of IActionBehavior in the underlying IoC container .
IBehavior Factory is a small abstraction around an IoC container to allow for some level of bootstrapping around the construction of the behavior before it is executed .
There is a simple BehaviorFactory implementation for StructureMap in the codebase , but it was n’t sufficient for us and I ’m not sure what to do about it exactly .
For Dovetail , our behavior bootstrapping code looks like this ( the real code is much shorter because it uses an extension method to handle the TransactionBoundary goop ) :
public class TransactionalContainerBehavior : IActionBehavior { private readonly IContainer _container ; private readonly IRequestData _request ; private readonly Guid _behaviorId ; //
This IActionBehavior “ wraps ” the real Behavior chain . // “ container ” is the root StructureMap Container for the application // behaviorId is the key to the desired ActionBehavior for this request // IRequestData is a Fubu specific abstraction around the RouteData and the HttpContext .
Request public TransactionalContainerBehavior ( IContainer container , IRequestData request , Guid behaviorId ) { _container = container ; _request = request ; _behavior
Id = behavior Id ; } public void Invoke ( ) { //
This uses the new “ Nested Container ” feature of StructureMap 2.5.4 ( which I ’ll release someday soon ) // to create a Container that tracks transient objects created by the container // in this logical transaction and disposes them at the end //
It also helps to make sure that every object in the behavior chain gets // the same NHibernate ISession using ( var nested = _container . GetNestedContainer ( ) ) { //
Dovetail specific stuff that starts an NHibernate session and transaction using ( var boundary = nested .
GetInstance <ITransactionBoundary >( ) )
{ // Start an NHibernate transaction boundary .
Start ( ) ; //
We do some injection based on the current IPrincipal , so it ’s important // for us to attach the Principal before creating the Behavior chain nested .
GetInstance < IAuthenticationService >( ) . SetupAuthenticationContext ( ) ; //
Now , resolve the named ActionBehavior while ensuring that it has the right // request data in the container for this request var behavior = nested .
With ( _request ) .
GetInstance < IActionBehavior >( _behaviorId.ToString ( ) ) ; behavior .
Invoke( ) ; // Commit the transaction boundary .
Commit( ) ; } } } }
I do n’t know how you ’ll want to do this behavior bootstrapping , but the point is that you * can * customize it by plugging in your own behavior around the original invocation of the IoC container to build the ActionBehavior .
Ok , I ’m out of juice for the night .
Next time I ’ll talk about :
Executing Controller Actions Fubu’s “ ModelBinder ” approach Url Resolution – I think this is important and the MVC framework has totally missed this Configuration Model – Conventions First , Explicit DSL when you must , Attributes when there ’s no other way …

Thanks to reader Allison West for the tip .
SAN DIEGO -- The Utah Utes flat out know how to win bowl games , whether they 're busting the BCS or playing in a lower - tier game before Christmas .
True freshman Jordan
Wynn threw for a career - high 338 yards and three touchdowns to rally No. 23 Utah from an early two - touchdown deficit to a 37 - 27 victory over California in the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl on Wednesday night .
The Utes scored 27 straight points to win their ninth straight bowl game , the longest current streak in the country and tied for the second -
longest ever .
Florida State won 11 straight from 1985 - 96 and Southern California won nine in a row from 1923 - 45 .
" It 's the work ethic of our players , " coach Kyle Whittingham said .
" We do n't have any secret , magic way of practicing for bowl games .
It 's how our guys go about their business .
It 's their work ethic and focus .
They understand a bowl game is a reward for a good season but also a chance to win another ballgame . "
The Utes ' bowl victory streak began with a win over Fresno State in the 1999 Las Vegas Bowl .
A member of the Mountain West Conference , the Utes were the original BCS busters , beating Pittsburgh 35 - 7 in the Fiesta Bowl after the 2004 season .
They also beat Alabama 31 - 17 in the Sugar Bowl last season .
Cal is the fifth team from a BCS conference to lose to Utah during the streak .
Utah did n't play in bowl games following the 2000 and 2002 seasons .
The Golden Bears , in a bowl game for the school - record seventh straight year , had their four - game postseason winning streak snapped .
" We did n't come into this game overconfident , " Cal coach Jeff Tedford said .
" That 's a good football team there .
I do n't know what the perception is throughout , but we give them a lot of respect .
They did a nice job of controlling the line of scrimmage . "
Wynn improved to 3 - 0 at Qualcomm Stadium , including two section championships while the starter at suburban Oceanside High .
He graduated last December and enrolled at Utah in January , allowing him to participate in spring ball .
Wynn completed 26 of 36 passes and improved to 3 - 2 as the Utes ' starter .
Utah 's defense came up big , too .
The Utes sacked Cal's Kevin Riley five times and intercepted him twice , with linebacker Stevenson Sylvester returning a tipped pass 27 yards for a touchdown late in the game .
Riley also lost a fumble .
" It 's a great feeling , especially at home , to play the way I did and get a bowl win , " Wynn said .
" The defense had a great night .
It 's kind of been the story all year .
Our defense is solid .
We rely on them to keep us in the game . "
Shane Vereen , who scored twice , was the seventh Cal back to gain more than 100 yards in a bowl , finishing with 122 yards on 20 carries .
Utah ( 10 - 3 ) looked overmatched after Cal ( 8 - 5 ) scored twice in 11 seconds midway through the first quarter .
Vereen scored on a 36 - yard run and Eddie Young intercepted Wynn on the first play of Utah 's next drive and returned it 31 yards for a score .
After that it was all Utah .
" Our coaches told us to calm down , " Wynn said about the quick deficit .
" It was early in the game .
We knew there was a lot of time left to just slow it down and make plays and claw ourselves back in the game . "
Young said the Golden Bears hoped to rattle the young QB .
" That was our plan going in , to make him make tough reads , " he said .
" But they made plays and he threw the ball down the field and his receivers went up and got the ball . "
Utah 's defense shut down Cal and Utah scored on its last four possessions of the first half .
Wynn threw a 6 - yard touchdown pass to tight end Kendrick Moeai late in the first quarter and Joe Phillips ' 28 - yard field goal early in the second quarter pulled Utah to 14 - 10 .
Wynn 's 15 - yard scoring pass to Moeai gave Utah the lead and his 21 - yarder to Jereme Brooks made it 24 - 14 at halftime .
Riley fumbled early in the third quarter when he was sacked by Lamar Chapman , with Mike Wright recovering at the 14 .
That set up Phillips ' 29 - yard field goal for a 27 - 14 lead .
Cal finally scored again on a 1 - yard run by Vereen with 39 seconds left in the third quarter to pull the Golden Bears to 27 - 21 before Phillips kicked a 25 - yard field goal .
Riley was 20 of 36 for 214 yards and one touchdown .
Cal had only six first downs in the first half .
Utah 's David Reed set school records for catches ( 81 ) and receiving yards ( 1,188 ) in a season .
Both records came on a 39 - yard catch in the fourth quarter .
" The record came along with being part of this great program , great coaches , great organization , great everything , " Reed said .
" Jordan Wynn played a great game and it can't get any better than the way it finished . "
Curtis Allina , a candy company executive who presided over a powerful innovation in marketing that was less about the candy itself than it was about the container it came in  and who in unintended consequence created a universe of enraptured collectors  died Dec. 15 at his home in Olympia , Wash .
Mr. Allina , who helped bring the world the modern Pez dispenser , was 87 .
The cause was heart failure , his son , Johnny , said .
For nearly three decades after World War II , Mr. Allina was the vice president in charge of United States operations at what is now Pez Candy .
In 1955 , at his urging , what had been an austerely packaged Austrian confection for adults took on vibrant new life as a children ’s product .
That year , the first character dispensers , as they are known in the parlance of Peziana , were issued , giving birth to what is today a highly collectible pop-cultural artifact .
Instantly recognizable , the dispensers are slim plastic containers , usually anthropomorphic in design , whose heads  modeled after those of TV characters , cartoon figures or historical personages  flip back to disgorge brick - shaped pieces of candy .
The stimulus bill enacted this year has resulted in as many as 1.6 million jobs saved or created this fall , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) said Monday evening .
The nonpartisan CBO said in a legally mandated report that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) had resulted in between 600,000 and 1.6 million jobs for the U.S. economy that would n't have existed in the absence of the stimulus .
Additionally , the CBO said , gross domestic product ( GDP ) was as much as 3.2 percent higher than it would have been in the absence of the stimulus .
CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf wrote on his official blog :
Looking at the actual amounts spent so far ( where identifiable ) and estimates of the other effects of ARRA on spending and revenues , CBO has estimated the law ’s impact on employment and economic output using evidence about how previous similar policies have affected the economy and various mathematical models that represent the workings of the economy .
On that basis , CBO estimates that in the third quarter of calendar year 2009 , an additional 600,000 to 1.6 million people were employed in the United States , and real ( inflation - adjusted ) gross domestic product ( GDP ) was 1.2 percent to 3.2 percent higher , than would have been the case in the absence of ARRA .
The White House had claimed in its own estimate of the Recovery Act 's impact that the stimulus bill had saved or created roughly 640,000 jobs since going into effect earlier this year .
Republicans had attacked the White House jobs figures as " trying to cover up economic reality by manufacturing job numbers out of thin air " when the Obama administration released those data .
Republicans in Congress meanwhile point to testimony earlier this year from a Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) official maintaining it 's virtually impossible to glean such an estimate of the true impact of the stimulus .
The CBO said that the White House 's model for analyzing the stimulus was not comprehensive , and that its own analysis provided the best look at the impact of the stimulus so far .
Update , 1:23 p.m. : Vice President Joe Biden released the following statement about the CBO report :
This new report from the Congressional Budget Office is further evidence of what private forecasters and government economists have been saying : the Recovery Act is already responsible for more than 1 million jobs nationwide .
From independent economists to Congress ’s own nonpartisan research body , the experts have spoken and the debate is no longer whether the Recovery Act is creating and saving jobs , but how we provide even more opportunities to drive growth and support American workers .
This early progress less than halfway through the program is encouraging , but we ’re just getting started .
In the coming months , we ’ll break ground on thousands of infrastructure projects , launch multi-billion dollar broadband and high speed rail initiatives and make critical investments in our nation ’s schools and businesses through the Recovery
Act that will help put America back to work and lay a foundation for long - term economic growth .
Paul Naschy , an actor , director and screenwriter widely acknowledged as the dean of Spanish horror films , whose dark web of credits includes “ Night of the Werewolf , ” “ The Night of the Executioner , ” “ The Nights of the Wolf Man , ” “ Night of the Howling Beast ” and “ Good Night , Mr. Monster , ” died on Nov. 30 in Madrid .
He was 75 .
The cause was cancer , his son Sergio Molina told the Spanish news agency Efe .
A bloodied veteran of more than 100 pictures , Mr. Naschy retains an ardent cult following around the world , in particular for the films he made in the 1960s and ’ 70s , the apex of his long career .
Acting in his own films and those of other directors , writing many of his own screenplays and sometimes directing them , Mr. Naschy was responsible for a slew of movies that cheerfully explored the lurid , the violent , the sexual and not least of all the sanguinary .
Among them are “ Werewolf Shadow ” ( 1971 ) ; “ Dr. Jekyll and the Wolfman ” ( 1972 ) ; “ Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll , ” a k a “ House of Psychotic Women ” ( 1973 ) ; “ The Black Harvest of Countess Dracula ” ( 1973 ) ; “ Horror Rises From the Tomb ” ( 1973 ) ; “ Hunchback of the Morgue ” ( 1973 ) ; “ The Orgy of the Dead ” ( 1973 ) ; “ A Dragonfly for Each Corpse ” ( 1974 ) ; and “ Cannibal Killers  Human Beast ” ( 1985 ) .

There are a great many others .
A review of “ Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll ” on the Web site blogcritics.org last year called it “ an entertaining and somewhat bloody whodunit wherein an ex-con gets wrapped up with a trio of weird sisters in a remote French village , ” adding , “ Sex , murder , sex , sex , the actual slaughter of a pig , more sex and more murder are just some of the highlights in this enjoyable thriller . ”

Paul Krugman and I seem to agree that the worst part of a recession is unemployment .
Losing value in your 401 ( k ) is terrible , but not , for most people , catastrophic .
Losing your business or your job , on the other hand , is wretched , particularly when there are six job hunters for every job opening .
Where we differ is that Krugman does n't understand why the administration has not made creating jobs a top priority .
He wants transfers to state and local governments , a tax credit for increasing payrolls , and a WPA - style jobs program .
Other bloggers have attacked the first two ; I 'll just say that I 'm skeptical that a temporary tax credit will induce strained businesses to take on significant new operating costs .
But I want to talk about the jobs program , because it 's a superficially compelling idea that just wo n't work .
I do n't say this because I necessarily think it 's a bad idea .
During an employment slump as deep as ours , there are some compelling reasons to support the creation of temporary , low paid public jobs as an alternative to collecting unemployment .
There are risks , since someone doing a low - paid temporary job has less time to seek more fitting permanent employment .
But the risks are not so large that I would be unwilling to try such a program in the face of 10 % unemployment .
Unfortunately , all this is entirely academic , because the federal government cannot create something akin to the CCC or the WPA on the time frame that would help the people who are suffering now .
For one thing , there are powerful public sector unions , who are going to fiercely resist any attempt to create low paid temporary jobs that could be done by well paid government workers who have excellent benefits and job security .
I doubt the Republicans would be willing to take this one on ( or well disposed to a New WPA ) .
But with Democrats in control , this is pretty much a fatal objection .
Even if you could surmount union opposition , the federal government has an ever - increasing thicket of red tape that makes such a thing impractical .
It takes months to get hired for a job with the federal government .
It takes months to ramp up a new program .
By the time you 'd gotten your NWPA through Congress over strenuous union objections , appointed someone to head it , set up the funding and hiring procedures , and actually hired people , it would be 2011 .
Maybe 2012 .
Perhaps you could waive all the civil service and associated procedure surrounding federal hiring , but I do n't see how .
My father was the head of a trade association for the heavy construction industry , and most of my closest relatives either work for the government , or have done so in the past .
As you can imagine , over my lifetime I 've had a lot of conversations about government procedure and government projects .
Every so often I 'll read some description of a project out of the olden days -- the battle against malaria in Panama , the handling of the Great Mississippi Flood , or the creation of the WPA -- and just marvel at how fast everything used to be .
The WPA was authorized in April of 1935 .
By December , it was employing 3.5 million people .
The Hoover Dam took 16 years from the time it was first proposed , to completion ; eight years , if you start counting from the time it passed Congress .
Contrast this with a current , comparatively trivial project : it has been seventeen years since the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor was established by USDOT , and we should have a Record of Decision on the Tier II environmental impact statement no later than 2010 .
This for something that runs along existing rail rights of way , and in fact , uses currently operating track in many places .
I imagine this all sounds like a nattering nabob of negativity .
If there are procedural hurdles to jobs programs and high speed rail , we should challenge them , not resign ourselves to subpar policy !
Look , I may be skeptical that health care reform will be a net positive , but I do concede there 's some chance I 'm wrong ( and I will be glad if it is so ) .
But this is not merely unlikely ; is is the next nearest thing to impossible , short of armed revolution .
Many of the procedural hurdles involve court rulings , concerning law which Congress cannot overturn in some cases ( due process ) , or is n't going to ( civil rights legislation , civil service protections ) .
The obstacles arise out of things that individually , people , specifically Democrats , like : transparency , due process , environmental care , civil rights , unionism .
Cumulatively , they are devastating to federal productivity .
But it 's hard to get much support for repealing or altering them individually -- which is what you would have to do .
Philip Howard has built a second career out of railing against the steady trend towards hyperproceduralism , of which this is a small part .
So in this case , I think we 're better off looking for second best : things that the government can enact and implement relatively quickly .
More generous unemployment benefits , and further temporary extensions of the period for which you can collect them .
Other forms of cash and quasi - cash assistance to struggling families , like food stamps .
Payroll tax holidays .
These may not be optimal , but they are things that Congress can actually get going almost immediately , putting cash in the hands of people who are suffering .
Years of scientific debate over the extinction of ancient species in North America have yielded many theories .
However , new findings from J. Tyler Faith , GW Ph.D. candidate in the hominid paleobiology doctoral program , and Todd Surovell , associate professor of anthropology at the University of Wyoming , reveal that a mass extinction occurred in a geological instant .
During the late Pleistocene , 40,000 to 10,000 years ago , North America lost over 50 percent of its large mammal species .
These species include mammoths , mastodons , giant ground sloths , among many others .
In total , 35 different genera ( groups of species ) disappeared , all of different habitat preferences and feeding habits .
What event or factor could cause such a mass extinction ?
The many hypotheses that have been developed over the years include : abrupt change in climate , the result of comet impact , human overkill and disease .
Some researchers believe that it may be a combination of these factors , one of them , or none .
A particular issue that has also contributed to this debate focuses on the chronology of extinctions .
The existing fossil record is incomplete , making it more difficult to tell whether or not the extinctions occurred in a gradual process , or took place as a synchronous event .
In addition , it was previously unclear whether species are missing from the terminal Pleistocene because they had already gone extinct or because they simply have not been found yet .
However , new findings from Faith indicate that the extinction is best characterized as a sudden event that took place between 13.8 and 11.4 thousand years ago .
Faith 's findings support the idea that this mass extinction was due to human overkill , comet impact or other rapid events rather than a slow attrition .
" The massive extinction coincides precisely with human arrival on the continent , abrupt climate change , and a possible extraterrestrial impact event " said Faith .
" It remains possible that any one of these or all , contributed to the sudden extinctions .
We now have a better understanding of when the extinctions took place and the next step is to figure out why . "

Thomas Kean celebrates justification for Obama to expand war into Yemen
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , January 4 , 2010
9/11 Commission whitewash chief Thomas Kean told CNN yesterday that the Christmas Day plane bomber “ did us a favor , ” by allowing Obama to expand the so - called war on terror into Yemen , a startling reminder that the highly suspicious Flight 253 attack served to fulfil pre-determined U.S. geopolitical objectives .
“ This guy in some respects looking at it in retrospective probably did us a favor , ” Kean told CNN ’s State of the Union Sunday talk show , adding that the attempted attack shifted the Obama administration ’s attention away from health care and global warming and back to the war on terror .
“ We were n’t really focused on Yemen and the terrible things that are happening there .
Now we are and that ’s a good thing , ” said Kean .
“ The GOP chairman ’s quote raised eyebrows ; by his logic , the Sept. 11 , 2001 attackers may also have “ done us a favor ” by drawing US attention to extremism in Afghanistan , ” writes Raw Story ’s John Byrne .
However , Kean ’s implication that Yemen was not a subject of U.S. geopolitical interest before the attempted attack drew attention to the country is completely at odds with the facts .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A December 24 BBC
News report entitled Yemen : New frontier in US ‘ war on terror ’ revealed how the U.S. had already invested $ 70 million dollars over the last year on expanding the war on terror into Yemen and that “ US intelligence agencies are keeping a closer and closer watch in this newly - emerging theatre in the “ war on terror ” . ”
A week after the incident , President Obama pinned the blame for the attack on terrorists based in Yemen despite the fact that no formal investigation into the bombing had been concluded .
Obama ’s statement came one day after Britain ’s PM Gordon Brown called an “ emergency summit ” on “ extremism ” in Yemen .
“ Gordon Brown has invited key international partners to a high - level meeting in order to discuss how best to counter radicalization in Yemen , ” a statement issued by Downing Street announced .
“ The prime minister will host the event on 28 January in London . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The fact that the aborted plane bombing attack provided the perfect justification to expand U.S. military operations into Arabian Peninsula in the name of fighting Al - Qaeda makes the suspicious circumstances surrounding the December 25 incident all the more alarming .
As we have documented , The FBI has repeatedly changed its story in a haphazard effort to accommodate eyewitness testimony from passengers that conflicts with the official version of events .
At first the FBI denied that a second man was arrested in connection with the incident but later admitted a second man was handcuffed after Flight 253 passenger and eyewitness Kurt Haskell said he saw an Indian man being led away by authorities after sniffer dogs had found something in his luggage .
Officials then claimed that the man had not been on Flight 253 at all and was not connected with the incident , but had to reverse their statement again just days later when other eyewitnesses emerged , admitting that the man had been on the plane .
The fact that the FBI is apparently protecting accomplices involved with the bombing attempt , and thereby keeping the official story within the script necessary to pin the attack on a lone man from Yemen who was inspired by Al - Qaeda , blatantly suggests that the facts are being manipulated to fit a pre-conceived geopolitical agenda .
The attempted bombing has also been exploited to push for a renewal of the unconstitutional Patriot Act , as well as the implementation of invasive naked body scanners in all major airports .

The crisis of 2008 - 2009 exposed the U.S. financial system as being unstable , subject to abuse , and tending to favor the rich while putting everyone else deeper into debt .
The housing bubble was based on the biggest credit inflation in history .
It raised the prices of homes to unprecedented levels but created the deepest recession in a generation when it collapsed .
$ 6 trillion in wealth has now simply disappeared .
Meanwhile , unregulated global capitalism continues to concentrate wealth , outsource jobs to the cheapest possible labor markets , accelerate U.S. unemployment , and destroy local and regional economies .
Even if the recession results in a modest recovery , it is likely to be of the “ jobless ” variety , or else jobs at low wages , with the U.S. still the most wasteful , resource - intensive , debt - oriented economy in history .
A budget for war expenditures of almost $ 1 trillion does n’t help .
Steps toward recovery are being fueled by enormous increases in the national debt due to federal budget deficits now over $ 1.4 trillion a year , with the U.S. economy carrying a total debt load of $ 200,000 for every man , woman , and child in the nation .
The huge debts of government at all levels , combined with reliance on government employment as a Keynesian economic driver , have raised the total government tax and fee burden ( federal / state / local ) to up to 40 - 50 % of an individual ’s income .
The “ elephant in the room ” is the debt - based monetary system run by the Federal Reserve , which since its inception in 1913 has based the U.S. money supply almost entirely on bank lending , including lending to government for its deficits .
The Federal Reserve
Act gave the banking system the incredible privilege of creating money out of thin air and charging interest for its use .
The federal government now pays the banking system , trust funds , and investors , including foreign governments , almost $ 400 billion a year just for interest .
When you add it up , interest and taxes today probably consume over half the entire U.S. gross domestic product .
Final elimination of the gold standard in 1971 removed any objective measure of the value of Federal Reserve currency .
Since then , the dollar has lost 85 percent of its value .
Despite the rhetoric , government and Fed policies inflate the currency in order to pay off debt with dollars of less value .
Some members of Congress are trying to rein in the Fed , but so far with little success .
Numerous proposals for monetary reform are coming from all quarters , but the power of the Fed and banking system in favor of maintaining the status quo is enormous .
With the power wielded by the privileges of big banking , combined with big government and its Keynesian deficit - based financial system , we have completely forgotten that time in our history when money was viewed as a medium of exchange for producers of goods and services .
Prior to 1913 , the creation and use of money was much less centralized and mainly served the marketplace .
The true purpose and meaning of money was rediscovered during the Great Depression when many businesses and local jurisdictions produced their own money in the form of scrip .
Scrip is actually a more stable form of currency than bank - created fiat money where people are forced to accept the fiat money as legal tender .
Also stable is the use of self - generated “ trading units ” by trade exchanges acting as producer currency coops .
This is how the commercial “ bartering ” networks work .
Today a similar movement to the scrip of the 1930s has begun through the creation and use of legal alternative currencies .
Today , though , we have computerized databases to facilitate trading .
This movement may be our best immediate hope of achieving a semblance of real economic democracy and restoring local / regional economic sustainability .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman , a former Democrat who sits with Democratic caucus , said Tuesday that he would not rule out running for re-election in 2012 as a Republican .
Lieberman angered his colleagues in the Democratic caucus this week by threatening to torpedo health care legislation if it contains a government - run public health insurance or an expansion of Medicare .
Lieberman said he was n't sure which party , if any , he would represent in his next election .
" I like being an independent , so that 's definitely a possibility , " the Connecticut senator said .
" But I 'd say all options are open . "
He called running as a Republican " unlikely " but added that he would n't " foreclose any possibility . "
" I 've reached the stage in my career where I 'm not measuring every step I take based on how it 's going to affect the next election , " Lieberman said .
" I think if you do that , you end up compromising the quality of your service . "
In 2000 , Lieberman was Al Gore 's running mate when Democrats lost the closest presidential national election in U.S. history .
Six years later , he was defeated in the Democratic primary and then ran as an independent to win re-election to the Senate .
Lieberman still sits with the Democratic caucus , which holds 60 seats in the 100 - member Senate , the minimum amount necessary to overcome a filibuster .
That dynamic allowed Lieberman to assert his will in the health care debate by threatening to join a Republican filibuster if the health care bill contained the public option or Medicare expansion he opposes .
He acknowledged that his stance angered Democratic colleagues but said he acted on principle , not politics .
" I knew some of them were upset about positions I 'd taken , " Lieberman said .
" But like each of them , I did n't get elected by telling my voters in Connecticut that I would follow the majority of my caucus even if I thought on some things they were wrong .
We each have to do what we think is right . "
Taking a stand in the polarized political environment means " a bunch of people will think you 've done something great and a bunch of people will think you 've done something awful , " Lieberman said .
However , Lieberman 's stance on the health care bill could prompt a backlash from liberal Democrats .
He was criticized by liberal groups , and even his wife -- who formerly worked for a pharmaceutical company -- was targeted .
" I 've done what I thought was right , but it 's no fun to have your colleagues be angry at you , " Lieberman said .
" It 's no fun to have your wife attacked .
But , you know , you got to do what you think is right . "

THE HIDDEN 14 TH AMENDMENT AGENDA
By Michael LeMieux

The history of the united States of America is not free of defect .
But in spite of those defects we were able to fashion a society that rose above the norm of the time and created a nation founded on individual liberty .
One of the defects of the age becomes very much apparent when contrasted against the preamble to the Declaration of Independence in which it states :
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are crated equal . ”
And yet we were engaged in the practice of slavery .
This is not disputed and the history of slavery has been upon the earth as long as we have recorded history .
The Bible speaks of the slavery even during the time of Christ and before .
So was there a legal difference between a person who was a slave and person who was a citizen ?
The answer is obviously yes .
We will get into this a little later .
At the conclusion of the civil war , congress proposed the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments — abolishing slavery , and creating and granting federal citizenship , and suffrage ( voting ) for its new citizens .
The 13th Amendment was ratified December 6th , 1865 .
It is interesting to note that the last state to ratify this amendment was Mississippi on March 5th , 1995 , a full 130 years after the initial ratification , for a total of 36 out of our current 50 states .
The 13th Amendment states :
Section 1 . “ Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction . ”
Section 2 . “ Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . ”
This was the first amendment which included an enforcement clause .
Why did congress feel it necessary to include the 2nd section which gave them power to enforce this legislation ?
It was because they did not have the power to do so by Article 1 of the Constitution .
They were expanding their power .
Congress had only the powers that were enumerated under Article 1 , Section 8 .
They did not have any authority to enforce the 13th Amendment , as this power was not enumerated .
Now we have what I call the initial marriage of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
Congress needed to have power to enforce this amendment , to pass laws , ( legislate ) , and to give the Supreme Court , ( the judicial branch ) , the ability to side with congress via this amendment .
Up until this time , many of the states did not recognize blacks as persons who could become citizens .
Even with the passing of the 13th Amendment , the Federal Government had no power within the states to effect the necessary changes to force the issue .
In the case of Blair v. Ridgely , 97 D. 218,249 , S.P. the Supreme Court held “ Prior to the adoption of the federal Constitution , states possessed unlimited and unrestricted sovereignty and retained the same ever afterward .
Upon entering the Union , they retained all their original power and sovereignty ... ”
The Federal Government , therefore , could not force the states to do all that was required on the issue without granting this additional power .
One very important case of the time was Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1856 ) , which required the 14th Amendment to overturn the Supreme Courts decision .
The Dred Scott case was specifically about the rights of slaves , property owners , and the separation between federal and State jurisdiction .
The case was brought by Dred Scott , a black man , who by Missouri law , could not be a citizen of that state and , therefore , could not bring suit .
The court found in favor of Sandford , the defendant , due to the lack of jurisdiction .

In 1865 The Freedman ’s Bureau Act was established which aided the war department in dealing with refugees from the south .
It assisted with relocation , feeding , clothing , and transportation of blacks fleeing the south .
In 1866 the Civil Rights Act was passed by Congress .
It was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson , but the veto was overridden by Congress .
This act was the forerunner to the 14th Amendment .
This act made all persons born in the United States , citizens of the United States without regard to their previous condition , and it made those who denied blacks these rights guilty of a misdemeanor .
Problems began when organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan ( and others ) ignored the act and defied the federal government .
During this time , separatist and Klan groups did everything in their power to defeat attempts to integrate the blacks into the citizenry .
These acts included murder , burning of homes , beatings and many other atrocious acts .
In 1870 to 1871 , the Enforcement acts were put into place by congress to give further weight to the previous acts and to give criminal codes to violations of federal intent of the reconstruction amendments ( 13 , 14 , and 15 ) .
They also allow for federal prosecution under those codes .
Prior to the 14th Amendment the federal government had little or no jurisdiction over the citizens of the many states of the union .
After the 14th Amendment the federal government became directly involved with the citizens , to the detriment of our entire society and the constitutional republican form of government .
At this point , we lost the Constitution of our heritage and we entered a Constitutional dictatorship .
Because we elect a new person every four to eight years does not change the dictatorial powers the office holds .
If you have any doubt , review the thousands of executive orders / proclamations that create law and executive organizations — all without congressional approval .
Section 1 of the 14th Amendment reads :
“ All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . ”
The 14th Amendment attempts to change the very nature of our government and our Constitution .
The very first sentence states : “ All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . ”
For the first time in our history we had federal citizenship , which is separate and distinct from state citizenship .
More importantly , it created a change in the order of government — now the federal was placed ahead of the state .
Now here is where we have s sticky problem .
You see before the 14th Amendment there were no federal citizens only State Citizens .
So was the purpose of the 14th Amendment designed to make the newly freed slaves on par with the established citizenry ?
Or was it written this way to ensure federal superiority over the problem states and ensure there would be no further rebellion ?
If we look at the continued expansion of the federal government since this time into areas that are not enumerated in the Constitution we would have to assume it was the latter .
But this is a discussion for another article .
In Dred Scott v. Sandford the Supreme Court states : “ The words ‘ people of the United States ’ and ‘ citizens ’ are synonymous terms , and mean the same thing …
They are what we familiarly call the ‘ sovereign people ’ and every citizen is one of this people . ”
And when answering whether those falling under the 14th Amendment are constituent members of this sovereignty they responded : “ We think they are not , and that they are not included , and were not intended to be included , under the word “ Citizens , ” in the Constitution , and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States … and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them . ”

Those that were citizens prior to the 14th Amendment , De Jure Citizens , had already been defined by those that drafted the document .
The 14th Amendment could not redefine that term as they were not the authors and the only other recourse besides this amendment was to hold a Constitutional Convention to foundationally change the founding documents .
So instead they crated a second class of citizen – the 14th Amendment citizen .
One other point of interest is that not everyone in our country has the same ‘ rights . ’
As a matter of fact 14th Amendment citizens do not have rights ; they only have privileges and immunities .
Remember , our ‘ Unalienable Rights ’ come from our creator ; privileges and immunities come from government and what government can give it can take away .
In fact the 14th Amendment does not refer to rights at all and the only illusion to parity was a mention of the 4th Amendment Due Process clause wording dealing with life , liberty , and property .
There is a term , internationally recognized , for someone who receives privileges and immunities from a governmental jurisdiction , it is called a subject .
This is what we were before we broke away from England ; wishing to no longer be ‘ subject to the jurisdiction thereof . ’
Obviously the existing ‘ Citizens ’ were not affected by the 14th Amendment ; in fact the Supreme Court has cited such .
It was only to provide for the protection of those to whom it confers federal citizenship upon .
Herein lays the problem .
As time progresses ; how does the federal government go about determining who is and who is not a 14th Amendment citizen ?
Because , as it is worded , anyone being naturalized , of whatever race , would become a 14th Amendment federal citizen .
So the federal government decided to ‘ assume ’ all persons desiring or attesting to be such were in fact 14th Amendment citizens and would treat them so .
However ; as time progressed it became ‘ common knowledge ’ or rather ‘ common assumption ’ that all citizens were the same .
If you were to poll 100 people on the street today if they are United States citizens nearly all 100 would answer in the affirmative .
Or conversely asking them if a person was born in a state of the Union what would be their citizenship ; nearly all would respond with United States citizen .
The federal government has also allowed anyone in the country to come under the protective arm of the federal citizenship by just attesting to such even if they were not 14th Amendment citizens .
How then do we attest to such ?
We do it every time we sign a document stating that we are a citizen of the United States ; such as voting , military service , passport application , Social Security Number , or the myriad of other financial and government forms .
In U.S. v. Anthony the courts stated : “ The rights of Citizens of the State , as such , are not under consideration in the Fourteenth Amendment .
They stand as they did before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , and are fully guaranteed by other provisions . ”
That is because the 14th Amendment did not give this other class of citizen the ‘ rights ’ enjoyed by the then current citizenry .
The Slaughter House case explains further is stating : “ It is quite clear , then , that there is a citizenship of the United States , and a Citizenship of a State , which are distinct from each other , and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual …
Of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the United States , and of the privileges and immunities of the Citizens of the State , and what they respectively are , we will presently consider , but we wish to state here that it is only the former , which are placed by this clause under the protection of the Federal Constitution , and that the latter , whatever they may be , are not intended to have any additional protection by this paragraph of the Amendment . ”
It could only be the former because the Citizenship of the latter was already settled and distinctly different from the new class of citizen .
Of course they do not tell us that there is a difference between these two classes of citizens because to do so would place a great strain on the supposed peace we all enjoy .
For instance : what if you found out that you were of the pre 14th Amendment class of Citizen and did not require to pay certain license fees or that you could own your property outright without the fear of tax liens .
In fact that every law that infringed upon your unalienable rights would automatically become void , but the government did not tell you .
There would be a great deal of unhappy people in this world .
On the other hand what if you were a 14th Amendment citizen and you found out that there was a whole class of Citizens that did not have to pay things you had to or that certain ‘ rights ’ were not available to you ; do you think there might be a few upset people ?
The problem is we have lived this way and have been lied to and brainwashed into thinking a certain way when in fact the reality , our history , and our Liberties have been distorted to hide the truth so that we can be controlled by a central government that no longer obeys the charter by which they were created .
The idea of an overbearing central government was repugnant to our founders .
We fought bitter wars at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives to get out from under such a government .
Today , and since the 14th Amendment , the federal government has invaded every aspect of our lives .
The hidden agenda of the 14th Amendment has been the total control of all the States of the Union and all the people , and the Constitution has been relegated to the history books by the superiority clause of this Amendment .

That those who rule America today are doing so with the interest of the federal government in mind and not the Citizens .
Michael believes that all three branches of government have strayed far from the checks and balances built into the Constitution and they have failed the American people .
A clear example is the Second Amendment , which the Supreme Court and the founders have all said was an individual right and could not be " infringed " upon , now has more than 20,000 state and federal laws regulating every aspect of the individuals right , a definite infringement .

WASHINGTON , Dec 3 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday that targeted tax credits for small businesses might be helpful as a job - creation measure provided that there is confidence the economy will grow .
“ There is a pretty good case for looking at targeted tax incentives to encourage both investment and new hiring and we ’re going to take a careful look at all those proposals , ” he said on Fox Business News .
He said the Obama administration was " looking at extending a bunch of other special tax incentives , " in addition to provisions for an expansion of loss carrybacks that was announced previously by the White House .

Currently , every ebuild in the main Gentoo repository is required to have a valid LICENSE entry .
However , the syntax of this entry is not officially defined and the entry itself is only used when outputting package details .
Furthermore , some software requires that a user interactively accept its license for its author 's to consider it legally binding .
This is currently implemented using eutils .
eclass .
Many users wish to regulate the software they install with regards to licenses for various reasons .
Some want a system free of any software that is not OSI - approved ; others are simply curious as to what licenses they are implicitly accepting .
Ebuild LICENSE
Variable
Most ebuilds are for software which is released under a single license .
In these cases , the current LICENSE variable can remain as is .
For example : LICENSE =" single - license "
However , there are several ebuilds for software which is released under several licenses , of which the user must accept one , some or all .
To complicate this , some ebuilds include optional components which fall under a different license .
To accommodate these cases , LICENSE syntax should accommodate all functionality offered by a DEPEND string .
To keep things simple , this GLEP proposes that the syntax be identical .
For example : LICENSE = " mandatory - license || ( choosable - licence1 chooseable - license - 2 ) useflag ? ( optional - component - license ) " License names may contain [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 ] ( english alphanumeric characters ) , _ ( underscore ) , - ( hyphen ) , . ( dot ) and + ( plus sign ) .
They must not begin with a hyphen , a dot or a plus sign .
License Groups
Almost all users are willing to install any software that is FSF - approved .
Other users are willing to install any software and implicitly accept its license .
To this end , implementations will also need to handle grouping of licenses .
At a minimum , there needs to be the groups GPL - COMPATIBLE , FSF - APPROVED , OSI - APPROVED and NON - MUST -HAVE -READ .
NON - MUST -HAVE -READ
licenses are those that do n't require manual acceptance for to be considered legally binding .
This is the current behaviour of portage .
These groups are defined in a new file license_groups in the profiles subdirectory of the tree ( or overlays ) .
Details of handling groups defined in overlays is implementation dependent .
The format of this file is < groupname > < license1 > < license2 > ... < licenseN >
Also any line starting with # is ignored and may be used for comments .
Group names use the same syntax as normal license names .
Also license groups may contain other groups .
License groups may not contain negated elements , so a group mygroup foo - bar - bla is illegal .
ACCEPT_LICENSE
This GLEP proposes that a user be able to explicitly accept or decline licenses by editing a new variable ACCEPT_LICENSE in /etc/make.conf .
Again , to keep things simple , the syntax should be similar to that of other incrementals .
For example : ACCEPT_LICENSE= " -* accepted - license - declined - license "
As an extension , ACCEPT_LICENSE must also support license groups .
This GLEP proposes that the license group be prepended by the special character " @ " .
For example : ACCEPT_LICENSE= "-* @ FSF - APPROVED " License groups may be negated with the result that all elements of that group are also negated .
Portage will also offer a package .
license facility to offer this functionality on a per-package base ( analog to package. keywords ) , other implementations may implement such a facility differently or not at all .
A blockbuster video game which sees players act as terrorists and shoot up civilians has sparked calls for the Australian classification system to be cleaned up .
The eagerly - anticipated Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 blasted past $ US300 million ( $ 325 million ) in sales on its opening day , blowing away even Hollywood films to become the highest - grossing entertainment launch ever .
The game , which uses realistic graphics to show a first - person view of terrorists shooting people , has been rated M ( 17 + ) in the United States and 18 + in the United Kingdom , but it has been given a MA15 + rating in Australia .
Australian Council on Children and the Media ( ACCM ) vice president Elizabeth Handsley wants the board to rethink its decision and says it should be banned .
" What we 've got here is something that appears to be a mistake - something that needs to be corrected , " she told ABC News Online .
" This material should not have been rated MA15 + - there seems to be a consensus for that .
" The problem is that this game is available at all .
We need to focus on that and on the effect it will have on those younger children whose hands it falls into . "
Advanced gamer Jeremy Ray , also known as Junglist , has played MW2 all the way through as says it is " entirely full - on " .
" When the terrorist level starts you step out of an elevator , the memorable line is one of the guys turning around to you and saying ' Remember , no Russian , ' " he told ABC News Online .
" Then all of you bring your guns up and you just unleash on an entire crowd of people .
There 's people screaming , some people trying to put their hands up to surrender , but everybody gets mowed down .
You can choose not to shoot , but you can also choose to throw grenades , kill security guards .
" You eventually come up to a balcony where you 're looking down on a massive crowd of people and then you can unleash of them .
Then you have to take out a SWAT team with riot shields . "
Ray says the terrorist level fits into the context of the game , but as a former reviewer for ABC2's Good Game , he is well aware of the inconsistency of what gets classified and what gets banned .
" It 's almost random ;
There 's absolutely a lack of consistency and there has been for years , " Ray said .
" I 've seen it in the last three years , reviewing games every week , I 've seen an example of the inconsistency about once every three weeks .
" Generally , if the game has a backing of a big company , it tends to get through . "
Ratings clean - up
The Australian gaming industry has been calling for an R18 + rating to cater for adult gamers and the release of this game has reignited that debate .
" Having no R rating encourages OFLC to rate games MA that should be R ( e.g. MW2 ? ) ! , " robdmoore said on Twitter .
" Game Classification in this country is FAIL , " walmillard tweeted .
The Gaming Developer Association of Australia president Tom Craigo , who has not yet played MW2 , agrees .
" Not having the R18 + removes options for the board - it 's either MA or it's banned , " he told ABC News Online .
" There 's this problem of shoe - horning where games get put in the MA category that should be rated R and that means children are playing games designed for adults . "
ACCM's Professor Handsley does not think there should be a R rating in Australia , but she says something must be done to fix the current system .
" There 's something wrong with the ratings system and it needs to be cleaned up , " she said .
" But that 's not to suggest we 'll solve all the problems by making R rated games legal .
That 's not the answer to problem - the solution is to clean up the classification system , make sure the criteria are applied consistently across games .
" We want to see a classification game that is credible and that works well for all concerned . "
Earlier this year a zombie shooter game Left 4 Dead 2 was refused classification due to its gory content .
It was later given an MA15 + rating after the distributor toned down the content .
Classifications laws cannot change without the support all state and territory attorneys - general .
South Australian Attorney - General Michael Atkinson has opposed the idea , leaving many in the gaming community to see him as a " road block " .
Mr Atkinson has already expressed his concern about MW2 getting an MA rating .
" I worry about any game that encourages gamers to perpetrate extreme violence and cruelty on screen , but this game allows players to be virtual terrorists and gain points by massacring civilians , " he said .
" Expecting game designers to be responsible by not glorifying terrorism will always lead to disappointment . "
A Classification Board spokesperson says the depiction of violence in the terrorist stage did not exceed the strong level , and in all other stages the killing of a civilian would result in immediate mission failure .
Reviewing a computer game is a matter for the Classification Review Board , which says it has not received an application to review this computer game .
January 14 , 2006 — jao
Back in the old days i was a macho C++ programmer , one of those sneering at Java or any other language but C , willing to manage my memory and pointers and mystified by the complexity of the template syntax ( it was difficult and cumbersome , ergo it had to be good ) .
Everyone has a past .
Things began to change when i decided to add Guile extensibility to GNU MDK .
I was using the project as an excuse to learn everything one has to learn to write free software , from parsers with flex and bison , to documentation generators like texinfo and doxygen or localisation via gettext .
Next thing was scriptability , and those days Scheme was still the way to extend your GNU programs ( last time i checked , GNOME was full of XML , a windows - like registry and , oh my , C# … no Scheme ( or good taste ) to be seen ) .
So , when i first encountered Scheme i was high on static type checking , object oriented programming in its narrow C++ flavour , and all that jazz .
I did n’t understand immediately what was so cool about having an interpreter , and defining functions without the compiler checking their signature at every single call made me feel uneasy .
I was told that i still had strong type checking in Lisp , but that it is deferred to run time , instead of at the apparently safer compile phase .
I did n’t get it .
Thanks god , SICP was so fun that i kept on learning , and i kept wondering for a while what was so great about interpreters and dynamic typing .
Problem was , i was writing C programs in Scheme .
In a compiled language ( a la C ) and , to some degree , in any statically typed one , your code is dead .
You write pages and pages of inert code .
You compile it .
Still dead .
Only when you launch that binary does it come to life , only that it lives elsewhere , beyond your reach .
Admittedly , i’m exaggerating : you can reach it in a convoluted way via a debugger .
But still .
A debugger is an awkward beast , and it will only work with the whole lot : all your program compiled , linked and whatnot .
Enter a dynamic language .
Enter its REPL .
When you have a , say , Lisp interpreter at your disposal you do n’t write your code first and load it later ( that ’s what i was doing at first ) .
You enter your code piecewise , function by function , variable by variable at that innocent looking prompt .
You develop incrementally , and , at every single moment , your objects and functions are alive : you can access them , inspect them , modify them .
Your code becomes an organic creature , plastic .
Its almost not programming , but experimenting .
Maybe you ’re raising a skeptical eyebrow .
Maybe you have one of those modern visual - something debugger that lets you modify your compiled code on the fly and continue running your code using the new definitions and you think that ’s what i’m talking about …
Well , no , sorry , that ’s only part of what i’m talking about .
To begin with , you continue executing your program .
I can do whatever i want .
But that ’s not all .
We are talking about a dynamically typed language .
That means that me and my little REPL have much more leeway to modify the living code , and thus much more margin to grow up and evolve the code .
At the end of the day , dynamically typed languages give me freedom .
Programming is a creative process and greatly benefits from that freedom .
At first , abandoning the safety net provided by static typing was a little bit scary , but as i grew up as a programmer i felt more and more confident , and gradually the initially uneasy feeling morphed into joy .
The joy of REPL .
Richard P. Gabriel has made a far better job in beautifully conveying what i’m trying to express in his excellent introduction to David Lamkins ’ book Successful Lisp , entitled The Art of Lisp and Writing .
Unfortunately , i have n’t found it online — you can read the first few pages in amazon.com ’s “ look inside this book ” section for this book .
And also in his essay Do Programmers Need Seat Belts ?.
Paul Graham has famously argued in favour of bottom - up development in many of his essays , and specially in Programming Bottom - Up :
It ’s worth emphasizing that bottom - up design does n’t mean just writing the same program in a different order .
When you work bottom - up , you usually end up with a different program .
Instead of a single , monolithic program , you will get a larger language with more abstract operators , and a smaller program written in it .
Instead of a lintel , you ’ll get an arch .
Finally , please note that i’m well aware that the static vs. dynamic typing debate is still open , and that decent type systems like those in Haskell and ML have , arguably , much to offer in the way to solid software engineering .
Type theory has also a powerful and beautiful mathematical foundation .
The above is just my gut feeling and current position on these issues , and i do n’t pretend to have backed it with solid technical argumentation .
Nor was it my goal .
I ’m more interested here in programming as a creative activity than as engineering .
