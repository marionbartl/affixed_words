19 - Jul -01 ; SMJ -= TOPS - 20 Starter Guide for UNIX users =-
Its important to know these basics before continuing : ^S = CTRL - S pause ouput ^Q = CTRL - Q unpause output ^O = CTRL - O ignore output ^U = CTRL - U clear input ^C = CTRL - C quits a job ^F = CTRL-F completion ( try < ESC > too ) ^T = CTRL - T Job Status ^\ = CTRL -\
When running ' LOGOUT ' use this to close TELNET
This document is written assuming that the reader has a basic understanding of the UNIX system .
However , it is not really necessary to have any system background when learning TOPS - 20 .
This is also not meant as an all in one document either .
TOPS - 20 is a multiuser operating system designed specifically for the 36 bit DEC PDP - 10 ( DECSYSTEM - 20 ) mainframe computer .
The USER level is called EXEC ( similar to the UNIX ' sh ' ) .
Above that is ENABLE , but we will just talk about the USER level in this document .
EXEC is interactive , in fact , tcsh is based off of an earlier EXEC in TENEX / The TOPS - 10 operating system , ( hence , tcsh is called TENEX C Shell ) .
However , tcsh is broken in the most important ways : EXEC has command completion via < ESC > or ^F EXEC has command recognition ( use ? to have EXEC tell you mapped completions ) CMD JSYS , the interactive bit of the MONITOR ( ' kernel ' ) supports real job control .
You can DETACH and ATTACH to any JOB or TTY you choose .
Also , you can PUSH and POP between EXEC levels .
Typically , when TOPS - 20 is spewing output to your screen it will send an XOFF to your TTY ( pause ) when you are ready to continue type ^Q .
If you do n't care about the output and want your job to continue without your interaction , just hit ^O .
You can also ^C or ^Z to quit or exit a program or job .
TOPS - 20 supports a hiearchical filesystem .
PS : ( primary storage ) is the system 's main device ( similar to / or root ) .
Directory paths are seperated by '.' .. for instance , say your LOGIN was ' SMJ ' .
Your home directory would be : PS :< SMJ > ( / smj )
Say there was a subdirectory within your home directory called LISP : PS :< SMJ.LISP > ( / smj/lisp ) TOPS - 20's file system supports file versioning and supporting two level file deletion .
Something that UNIX seriously lacks .
Files are made up of three components : FILENAME.EXTENTION.VERSION
The Wildcard * can be used for instance : @directory PS :< SMJ >*.*.*
Would list ALL files in that directory , if you only gave a *.* , then the current generation of ALL files would be listed .
QUICK AND DIRTY COMPARISONS : UNIX TOPS - 20 ----------------------------------------- talk TALK mesg n REFUSE LINKS mesg y RECEIVE LINKS ls DIRECTORY ls - la VDIRECTORY cat TYPE rm DELETE ( EXPUNGE ) mkdir BUILD rmdir BUILD who SYSTAT ps SYSTAT passwd SET DIRECTORY PASSWORD chmod SET DIRECTORY PROTECTION SET FILE PROTECTION man HELP . profile LOGIN.CMD .plan FINGER .PLAN send SEND mail ( sending ) SEND mail ( reading ) MM QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS : 0 . How do I connect and LOGIN ?
TELNET to twenex.org @LOGIN USERNAME PASSWORD ; your password wo n't echo .
1 . How do I set my password after logging in ?
@SET DIRECTORY PASSWORD < LOGIN > ; where LOGIN is your LOGIN .
2 . Does it have to be UPPERCASE ?
no. TOPS - 20 assumes you are using a printing TTY when you connect via the DZ11 terminal server .
To set up your terminal options , use the ' TERMINAL ' command .
Typically you will put these TERMINAL commands in your ' LOGIN .
CMD ' @TERMINAL NO RAISE ; this will set lowercase @TERMINAL ?
; this will give you a list of TTY options 3 .
How do I get more HELP ?
Read this file again .
Type @? and @HELP ?
4 . What editors are available for TOPS - 20 Lots !
Currently we have SED , EDIT10 and TV ( video TECO ) .
I will add EMACS , TECO and vi when I can .
5 . How do I access EXEC command history or edit previous commands ?
EXEC command history / editing must be setup by issuing the following SET commands : SET HISTORY 100 ; then set your favorite editor SET COMMAND - EDITOR EDIT EMACS SET COMMAND-EDITOR ENTER CONTROL " P " You can put these SET commands in your LOGIN .
CMD and in most cases ( on TWENEX.ORG ) this is included in your default LOGIN.CMD
To access your command history , press ^P ( CTRL P ) , you can then use EMACS keys to edit your previous commands .
Pressing RETURN will issue the command via the current EXEC .
To re-issue the last command issued , you can type ' REDO ' .
Not related , but relevant , you can return to the last program run ( which is still in memory ) by typing ' REENTER ' 6 .
What GAMES are available on this system ?
We have many esoteric and classic games available on this system .
To get a list and a description of each game , type ' HELP GAMES ' 7 .
How can I host a website here ?
Simply run the following command substituting your system LOGIN for ' LOGIN ' .
This creates the sub - directory ' HTML ' .
@BUILD < LOGIN.HTML >
Either edit your .HTML files in that directory or upload them using FTP .
Your URL will be HTTP:// TWENEX.ORG /~LOGIN
8 . How does DIRECTORY and FILE PROTECTION work ?
TOPS - 20 allows for 18 bit DIRECTORY and FILE protection settings which includes features found under 9 bit UNIX ' permissions ' as well as additional protections which are uniquely TOPS - 20 .
FOR FILES : OCTAL PROPERTY
--------------------
77 FULL ACCESS 40 READ 20 WRITE / DELETE 10 EXECUTE 04 APPEND 02 LIST 00 NO ACCESS FOR DIRECTORIES : OCTAL PROPERTY
--------------------
77 FULL ACCESS 40 READ 10 CONNECT 04 BUILD 00 NO ACCESS PROTECTIONS are grouped together in a set of 3 , and correspond as : @SET DIRECTORY PROTECTION < LOGIN > 777700 ^ ^ ^ | | \ all other users | \__ users in your group \____ your ( owner ) login Such that , you and users in your group have full access to the directory < LOGIN > , while all other users have no access .
If you are used to UNIX file permissions you should be immediately impressed that under TOPS - 20 you can create a file that : 1 . Does not show up in a directory listing 2 .
That is not readable even if you know its name 3 .
That is appendable to all users 9 .
How do I access the ' BBOARD ' ?
The TWENEX bboard is a publically accessible mail box which users of TWENEX.ORG can use to communicate with each other .
In your initial LOGIN .CMD the bboard 's latest message is called upon login .
You can always re-read the last message posted to the bboard by issuing ' BBOARD / LAST ' at the EXEC prompt .
TO SEND A MESSAGE : Simply use ' MAIL BBOARD ' to POST or REPLY to a message on the BBOARD .
TO READ A MESSAGE : The ' BBOARD ' command allows you to read and scan messages on the bboard using various criteria .
You can also use ' MM ' to browse the bboard by typing ' BBOARD MAIL ' from within ' MM ' 10 .
How can I use ' COMMODE ' , ' TALK ' , ' SEND ' or ' PHONE '?
In order to use these to CONVERSE with other users logged in to TWENEX.ORG , you must have ' TERMINAL RECEIVE LINKS ' set .
While using ' TALK ' you can either use the EXEC comment character ' ;' to prefix your lines , run ' REMARK ' so EXEC does n't interpret your input as commands or run COMMODE ( CHAT ) which will prefix all conversation lines with the user 's LOGIN name .
' SEND ' does not LINK TTYs , but allows users to send messages back and forth .
Once you have received a message from a user , you can ' REPLY ' to respond to the sender .
' PHONE ' is probably the most elaborate CHAT system .
It allows you to see who is online , if they 're willing to receive links and so on .
Please note that it is not consider respectable to just randomly LINK to user 's TTYs .
If you want to ' TALK ' with someone you 've never talked to before , please use ' SEND ' or ' MAIL ' first .
If you do n't get a response , do n't push it .
If you wish to not have messages sent to your TERMINAL , type : TERMINAL NO RECEIVE LINKS .

If this was the year that many readers  not to mention financial reporters  learned what C.D.O. , M.B.S. and SIV stood for , 2008 could be the year of C.D.S. and C.L.O .
( For those who came in late , those abbreviations from 2007 are shorthand for collateralized debt obligations , mortgage - backed securities and structured investment vehicles .
The new ones are credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations  a special kind of C.D.O. backed by corporate loans . )
We have learned in the last month that credit insurers took big risks in backing C.D.O. ’s and other exotic things .
Some are scrambling to raise more capital to stay in business .
One , ACA , may well go out of business .
But if the credit insurers turn out to have had inadequate reserves , what are we to make of the credit default swap market ?
Mr. Seides calls it “ an insurance market with no loss reserves , ” and points out that $ 45 trillion in such swaps are now outstanding .
That is , he notes , almost five times the United States national debt .
Many of those swaps cancel each other out  or will if everyone meets their obligations .
The big banks say they run balanced books , in which they sell insurance to one customer and buy insurance on the same borrower from another customer .
But if some customers cannot pay what they owe , this could be another shock for bank investors .
As it is , financial stocks have underperformed other stocks by record amounts this year .
One of the more remarkable facts about the subprime crisis is that total losses to the financial system may be about equal to the amount of subprime loans that were issued .
On the face of it , that appears absurd , since many such loans will be paid off , and those that default will not be total losses .
But , Mr. Seides said in an interview , “ the financial leverage placed on the underlying assets was so high ” that the losses multiplied , as the profits did when times were good .
“ When there is more leverage ” and things go wrong , he said , “ there are more losses . ”
The corporate credit market is vastly larger than the subprime market , and there are plenty of dubious loans outstanding that probably could not be refinanced in the current market .
If some of those companies run into problems , defaults could soar and fears about C.L.O. valuations and C.D.S. defaults could spread long before there are large actual losses on loans .
10,000 Earths ' Worth of Fresh Dust Found Near Star Explosion

Astronomers have at last found definitive evidence that the universe 's first dust - the celestial stuff that seeded future generations of stars and planets - was forged in the explosions of massive stars .
The findings , made with NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , are the most significant clue yet in the longstanding mystery of where the dust in our very young universe came from .
Scientists had suspected that exploding stars , or supernovae , were the primary source , but nobody had been able to demonstrate that they can create copious amounts of dust - until now .
Spitzer 's sensitive infrared detectors have found 10,000 Earth masses worth of dust in the blown - out remains of the well - known supernova remnant Cassiopeia A.
" Now we can say unambiguously that dust - and lots of it - was formed in the ejecta of the Cassiopeia A explosion .
This finding was possible because Cassiopeia A is in our own galaxy , where it is close enough to study in detail , " said Jeonghee Rho of NASA 's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
Rho is the lead author of a new report about the discovery appearing in the Jan. 20 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
Space dust is everywhere in the cosmos , in our own neck of the universe and all the way back billions of light - years away in our infant universe .
Developing stars need dust to cool down enough to collapse and ignite , while planets and living creatures consist of the powdery substance .
In our nearby universe , dust is pumped out by dying stars like our sun .
But back when the universe was young , sun - like stars had n't been around long enough to die and leave dust .
That 's where supernovae come in .
These violent explosions occur when the most massive stars in the universe die .
Because massive stars do n't live very long , theorists reasoned that the very first exploding massive stars could be the suppliers of the unaccounted - for dust .
These first stars , called Population III , are the only stars that formed without any dust .
Other objects in addition to supernovae might also contribute to the universe 's first dust .
Spitzer recently found evidence that highly energetic black holes , called quasars , could , together with supernovae , manufacture some dust in their winds ( http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-16/index.shtml ) . Rho and her colleagues analyzed the Cassopeia A supernova remnant , located about 11,000 light - years away .
Though this remnant is not from the early universe , its proximity to us makes it easier to address the question of whether supernovae have the ability to synthesize significant amounts of dust .
The astronomers analyzed the infrared light coming from Cassiopeia A using Spitzer 's infrared spectrograph , which spreads light apart to reveal the signatures of different elements and molecules .
" Because Spitzer is extremely sensitive to dust , we were able to make high - resolution maps of dust in the entire structure , " said Rho .
The map reveals the quantity , location and composition of the supernova remnant 's dust , which includes proto-silicates , silicon dioxide , iron oxide , pyroxene , carbon , aluminium oxide and other compounds .
One of the first things the astronomers noticed was that the dust matches up perfectly with the gas , or ejecta , known to have been expelled in the explosion .
This is the smoking gun indicating the dust was freshly made in the ejecta from the stellar blast .
" Dust forms a few to several hundred days after these energetic explosions , when the temperature of gas in the ejecta cools down , " said Takashi Kozasa , a co-author at the Hokkaido University in Japan .
The team was surprised to find freshly - made dust deeper inside the remnant as well .
This cooler dust , mixed in with gas referred to as the unshocked ejecta , had never been seen before .
All the dust around the remnant , both warm and cold , adds up to about three percent of the mass of the sun , or 10,000 Earths .
This is just enough to explain where a large fraction , but not all , of the universe 's early dust came from .
" Perhaps at least some of the unexplained portion is much colder dust , which could be observed with upcoming telescopes , such as Herschel , " said Haley Gomez , a co-author at University of Wales , Cardiff .
The Herschel Space Observatory , scheduled to launch in 2008 , is a European Space Agency mission with significant NASA participation .
Rho also said that more studies of other supernovae from near to far are needed to put this issue to rest .
She notes that the rate at which dust is destroyed - a factor in determining how much dust is needed to explain the dusty early universe - is still poorly understood .
The principal investigator of the research program , and a co-author of the paper , is Lawrence Rudnick of the University of Minnesota , Twin Cities .
Other co-authors include W.T. Reach of the Spitzer Science Center ; J. D. Smith of the Steward Observatory , Tucson , Ariz . ; T. Delaney of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge ; J.A. Ennis of the University of Minnesota ; and A.

polyrized ,
Sorry , to hear about your experience with the CIA's
polygraph .
Here is a clear example how derogatory
information is sent to other agencies ( e.g. , NSA to
DoD/DSS ) , and how this can affect current clearances .
My last full - scope poly was in the 1990s and I will never
take one again ( I guess , I have grown past it ) .
It is
amazing that Intel agencies think that one 's sex life
is their business , and that applicants let it be so .
As I
stated before , my NSA polygrapher said that he
masturbated to porn on the Internet ( a ruse to get me
to admit to it ) .
Let this experience be a warning to all .
polyrized :
If you have a DoD clearance and it gets
revoked , you can hire a lawyer and fight in the DoD's
appeals court ( you will get a statement - of - reasons ,
SOR , from the DoD Department of Hearings and Appeals ,
DOHA ) .

In September Randy Pausch , a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University , gave his last lecture , telling the audience that he would soon die of pancreatic cancer .
But those may not be his last public words after all .
After delivering the talk , Dr. Pausch had planned to enjoy his last days with his family .
Instead , Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Zaslow wrote a column about the unusual lecture , which he described as a “ riveting and rollicking journey through the lessons ” of Dr. Pausch ’s life , and the professor became a media sensation .
Dr. Pausch had spoken of his belief that people ultimately will impress you if you wait long enough and his view that kids should be allowed to draw on their bedroom walls .
A video of the talk quickly spread over the Internet : the lecture was translated into German , even Mandarin .
Dr. Pausch was asked to appear on “ Oprah ” and “ Good Morning America . ” ( I also wrote about Dr. Pausch on this blog . )
Apparently publishers are convinced the public wants to hear more .
Today , the New York Post reports that in a frenzy for rights to a book based on Dr. Pausch ’s lecture , co-authored by Mr. Zaslow , bidding has reached nearly $ 7 million .
The proposed book reportedly will tell the stories behind the wisdom Dr. Pausch dispensed that day .
To understand the fuss over one professor ’s final lecture , check out the talk for yourself .
Here ’s the original Wall Street Journal article , which includes a video excerpt , as well as a follow - up story written by Mr. Zaslow .
If you have time , watch Dr. Pausch ’s inspiring hour - long lecture in its entirety .
You can download the video or find a full transcript on his home page .
Here ’s a copy , if you ’d like to see it now .
( Dr. Pausch warns viewers than the first eight minutes comprise “ embarrassing introductions I do n’t deserve . ” )
WASHINGTON , Oct. 17 — The head of the Federal Communications Commission has circulated an ambitious plan to relax the decades - old media ownership rules , including repealing a rule that forbids a company to own both a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same city .
Kevin J. Martin , chairman of the commission , wants to repeal the rule in the next two months — a plan that , if successful , would be a big victory for some executives of media conglomerates .
Among them are Samuel Zell , the Chicago investor who is seeking to complete a buyout of the Tribune Company , and Rupert Murdoch , who has lobbied against the rule for years so that he can continue controlling both The New York Post and a Fox television station in New York .
The proposal appears to have the support of a majority of the five commission members , agency officials said , although it is not clear that Mr. Martin would proceed with a sweeping deregulatory approach on a vote of 3 to 2 — something his predecessor tried without success .
In interviews on Wednesday , the agency ’s two Democratic members raised questions about Mr. Martin ’s approach .
SESTO FIORENTINO , Italy – Professor Stefano Mancuso knows it is n't easy being green :
He runs the world 's only laboratory dedicated to plant intelligence .
At the International Laboratory of Plant Neurobiology ( LINV ) , about seven miles outside Florence , Italy , Mancuso and his team of nine work to debunk the myth that plants are low - life .
Research at the modern building combines physiology , ecology and molecular biology .
" If you define intelligence as the capacity to solve problems , plants have a lot to teach us , " says Mancuso , dressed in harmonizing shades of his favorite color : green .
" Not only are they ' smart ' in how they grow , adapt and thrive , they do it without neuroses .
Intelligence is n't only about having a brain . "
Plants have never been given their due in the order of things ; they 've usually been dismissed as mere vegetables .
But there 's a growing body of research showing that plants have a lot to contribute in fields as disparate as robotics and telecommunications .
For instance , current projects at the LINV include a plant - inspired robot in development for the European Space Agency .
The " plantoid " might be used to explore the Martian soil by dropping mechanical " pods " capable of communicating with a central " stem , " which would send data back to Earth .
The idea that plants are more than hanging decor at the dentist 's office is not new .
Charles Darwin published The Power of Movement in Plants – on phototropism and vine behavior – in 1880 , but the concept of plant intelligence has been slow to creep into the general consciousness .
At the root of the problem : assuming that plants have , or should have , human - like feelings in order to be considered intelligent life forms , Mancuso says .

So while there has been a bumper crop of studies demonstrating that green matter can be nearly as sophisticated as gray matter – especially when it comes to signaling and response systems , few talk about intelligence .
To christen the lab in 2004 , Mancuso decided to use the controversial term " plant neurobiology " to reinforce the idea that plants have biochemistry , cell biology and electrophysiology similar to the human nervous system .
But although LINV is part of the University of Florence – where Mancuso teaches horticulture – funds for this fertile field of research were n't forthcoming .
Studies at LINV were eventually given lymph – 1 million euro so far , with about 500,000 euro to come – from the Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze , a bank foundation that mainly supports cultural events and art restorations .
What convinced them to provide seed money ?
" Looking beyond the name at the research , " says Paolo Blasi , a physics professor at the university who 's on LINV 's board of directors .
" It sounds almost like a pseudoscientific field , but now even skeptics are convinced because of the validity of the work . "
In addition to studies on the effects of music on vineyards , the center 's researchers have also published papers on gravity sensing , plant synapses and long - distance signal transmission in trees .
One important offshoot of the research activity is an international symposium on plant neurobiology .
Next year 's meeting will be held in Japan .
Leopold Summerer , advanced - concepts team coordinator at the European Space Agency , remembers that the term " plant intelligence " raised a few eyebrows when collaboration with the lab was proposed – even on a multidisciplinary think - tank team that 's used to pondering ideas out of left field .
Nonetheless , Summerer says plant research may provide important ideas .
" Biometrics can provide some of the most inspiring resources for us , " he says .
" Solutions found by nature that might not seem related to real engineering problems at first sight actually are related and give technical solutions . "
Radical as the LINV sounds , if it were n't for a lone sugarcane stalk perched on a cabinet , the lab looks like any other .
While white - coated researcher Luciana Renna patiently tests for DNA markers , molecular biologist Giovanni Stefano analyzes data on two computer monitors around the corner .
During a visit to the lab's two greenhouses – where research is being conducted on the effects of light on olive trees and reactions in Venus flytraps and the Mimosa pudica – Mancuso points out a few neglected office plants sent there for a little TLC .
Mancuso , however , is no plant - whisperer .
Under - tended plants are a long way from understanding sweet nothings spoken softly to them , he explains .
" Plants communicate via chemical substances , " Mancuso says .
" They have a specific and fairly extensive vocabulary to convey alarms , health and a host of other things .
We just have sound waves broken down into various languages , I do n't see how we could bridge the gap . "
The above story has been making the rounds -- at least among the Democrats .
The Republicans could care less .
And why should they ?
Deficits do n't matter ( unless you 're long the dollar ) .
To say that Bush has been a fiscal disaster would be an insult to good hearted disasters .
The bottom line is Bush and his war have done nothing except endanger the fiscal health of future US generations .
Let 's go over the basic facts -- again , for those of you playing along at home .
Bush inherited a budget surplus .
And he went right back to the Regan school of economics : cut taxes for the rich and mire the country in debt .
Here 's a chart of federal receipts and expenditures going back to 1990 .
Expenditures are in blue and receipts are in red .
Notice a trend ?
Someone is n't balancing the books .
And before you say , " the budget is balanced " notice the amount of debt the government is issuing .
Ask yourself a simple question : if you balanced your checkbook every month , would you need to borrow any money ?
Just in case you forgot -- the current level of total federal debt is
$ 9,057,981,725,122.80
And notice that every year , the federal government has issued tons of debt since Bush took office .
09/30/2006 $ 8,506,973,899,215.23
09/30/2005 $ 7,932,709,661,723.50
09/30/2004 $ 7,379,052,696,330.32
09/30/2003 $ 6,783,231,062,743.62
09/30/2002 $ 6,228,235,965,597.16
09/30/2001 $ 5,807,463,412,200.06
09/30/2000 $ 5,674,178,209,886.86
In other words -- this is n't a one time event .
This is the way the Republicans run the country .
Poorly .
So , let 's return to the CBOs estimate of $ 2.7 trillion that the US will spend on the war until 2017 .
Now , let 's ask ourselves a very simple question :
WHERE IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE GOING TO GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT ?
We 're already issuing $ 500 billion or more of net new debt per year for the last 5 years .
That means one very important thing is not happening -- we 're not balancing our budget in any way shape or form .
Instead , we 're spending the Social Security Trust Fund ( which we 're supposed to be saving ) for today 's expenditures .
And let 's remember the fiscally responsible Republican Party was completely in control for 6 of the last 7 years of fiscal history .
They have absolutely no idea how to deal with national finances .
How much more debt can we float before our creditors stop lending us money ?
The Republicans want to find out .
It ’s winter and what Candy Addict does n’t love some liquid chocolate ?
I am a hot cocoa fanatic .
I hate the cold , but the only ray of sunshine in an otherwise dismal winter is the prospect of hot cocoa .
It must be served in the winter .
Thereâ€™s something so soothing about drinking warm chocolate when youâ€™re wrapped up in a blanket on a cold night .
I chose seven types of hot chocolate for this tasting .
They are , in the order I tasted them , Hersheyâ€™s Special Dark Hot Cocoa , Cacao Reserve by Hersheyâ€™s Mayan Blend Drinking Cocoa Premium Mix , Land O’Lakes Butterscotch Hot Cocoa , Land of Lakes Mint Hot Cocoa , Swiss Miss French Vanilla Hot Cocoa , Swiss Miss Dark Chocolate Sensation Hot Cocoa , and Godiva Hot Cocoa .
The first obstacle in tasting all these cocoas was the water vs. milk debate .
Some of the hot cocoas direct you to use water specifically , others say to use milk instead , and still others have water in the directions but say , â€ œfor a richer creamier treat , replace water with heated milk .â€ 
At first , I decided to follow their strict instructions , but ended up winging it a little .
I always choose milk over water , but for the purposes of the review , I used water when it was called for , in most instances .
On to the reviews . . .

They suggested water in their directions but optionally suggested milk for a richer , creamier treat .
Iâ€™m all for richer and creamier so I used 6 ounces of 2 % milk .
I heated it in the microwave in a measuring cup and poured it over the cocoa in a mug .
I had trouble getting all the cocoa to dissolve .
I wish I had a small whisk for such a time .
It was a bitter cup of hot cocoa with a sweet aftertaste that lingered .
Personally , I love dark chocolate , but this was too bitter , even for me .
I guess I like my hot chocolate sweeter than I like my candy bar chocolate .
It did have a nice creamy foam that enhanced the experience .
Afterwards , I felt like I needed to brush my teeth .
Cost : $ 2.17 for five 1.25 oz .

They suggested 6 ounces of hot water to make this hot cocoa and didnâ€™t mention milk anywhere .
In fact , there was some comment about the original cocoa drinkers mixing it with water , so I think they wanted you to use water , so I did .
It was a very dark cocoa , maybe even darker than the â€œSpecial Darkâ€  I had just tried .
It had a weird flavor that I couldnâ€™t really place .
At first I thought it was a little nutty , although the ingredients do not mention any nuts .
Then I thought it tasted kind of burnt .
I did notice that tiny granules of the cocoa were visible when splashed against the side of the cup , like it didnâ€™t dissolve or something .
It really wasnâ€™t chocolatey ; that , or it just didnâ€™t taste like any chocolate I was used to .
It was smooth though , and I think it was better than the Special Dark .
Cost : $ 0.44 for one 1.25 oz .

As soon as I opened the package , this wonderful Butterscotch aroma came wafting towards me .
It really made me eager to try it .
It called for 6 ounces of water and , again , no mention of milk as an option , so I used water ( against my better judgment ) .
The powder was a pretty caramel color .
When I mixed in the hot water , it was a pretty light chocolate color and had a good froth to it .
It definitely had a buttery flavor .
I wish I had bought two so that I could try one with milk .
I think it would have been much better with milk .
The froth was very tasty ; it reminds me of a specialty coffee for some reason .
Itâ€™s got a lingering sweetness about it .
I liked it more than the others so far .
Breaktime
At this point in the tasting process , I was starting to feel a little sick .
Granted , I wasnâ€™t drinking the full cup of each type of cocoa , but still , all the sweetness was getting to me .
I decided to eat a few grapes ( Iâ€™ve heard they cleanse the palette ) , drink some water , and push on .
Oh , the sacrifices we make as Candy Addicts .
Cost : $ 0.44 for one 1.25 oz .
package

This cocoa suggested water as well , but since I regretted not using milk with the Butterscotch Land O’Lakes , I went ahead and used 6 ounces of milk with the mint flavor .
When I opened the package , there wasnâ€™t a very strong mint smell to it .
I had to stick my nose right up to the cup to smell any mint at all .
As the milk heated in the microwave , I kept sniffing it to place the kind of mint that I smelled .
In the end , I decided it smelled kind of medicinal , maybe even like that stuff you rub on your chest when youâ€ ™re sick ( Vap - O - Rub ? ) , but much less strong .
I poured it in the cup and poured the hot water over it and stirred well .
It wasnâ€™t very dark and the cocoa dissolved quickly and fully , no globs of cocoa .
The mint flavor was very light , just kind of a light aftertaste .
It was sweet though .
It was rich and creamy , probably due mostly to the milk I used .
It wasnâ€™t as good as the butterscotch , thatâ€™s for sure , and I sure couldnâ€™t drink a whole cup of it because it was so sweet .
It was too sweet and not nearly minty enough .
Cost : ~ $ 1 for a box of eight 1 oz .
packages
Nutritional information : 110 calories , 2g of fat , 24g of carbs ( 1g of fiber ) , 2g of protein
This cocoa called for hot water , not milk , so I used water as it suggested .
It created a very frothy hot cocoa and the cocoa mixed well with the hot water , no lumps .
It smelled very vaguely of vanilla .
When I tasted it , I was very pleased .
It was delicious !
It was sweet , but not too sweet .
I imagine it would be very good with mini marshmallows .
I didnâ€™t use any marshmallows in my reviews , thinking that it would cover up the true cocoa flavor I was reviewing .
I do love mini marshmallows though .
I used to drink French Vanilla Cappuccino in college to stay awake late at night , but I never really liked coffee .
This is exactly like those French Vanilla Cappuccino drinks but without the coffee .
Itâ€™s perfect !
This was so good that I didnâ€™t want to pour out the rest of the mug to go on to my next cocoa tasting .
The only consolation I had was that there were seven more packets in the Swiss Miss box to look forward to drinking another evening .
This cocoa was cheap , lower in calories and delicious !
Cost : ~ $ 1 for a box of eight 1.25 oz .
packages
Nutritional information : 150 calories , 3g of fat , 28g of carbs ( 2g of fiber ) , 2g of protein
This cocoa called for hot water as well , so I went ahead and used it .
The Swiss Miss packages say that the cocoa mix contains milk ; perhaps thatâ€™s why they still taste good when you use water instead of milk .
The powder was very dark .
It didnâ€™t have a very good smell to it but you could see the sugar crystals mixed in with the cocoa .
It looked like it would make a very dark cocoa .
When I mixed the water and cocoa , there wasnâ€™t any froth at all .
It had a rich , chocolatey taste , but not too bitter like the Hersheyâ€™s Dark I had tried earlier .
It was n’t too sweet so I could definitely drink the whole cup .
It is a very indulgent cocoa , but also very good .
It was like eating a candy bar .
I would definitely recommend the Swiss Miss Dark .
I initially rated this a 5 star hot cocoa , but after tasting the next and last cocoa , I bumped it down to 4 stars .
Cost : $ 5.00 for four 1.1 oz .

Nutritional information : 130 calories , 2.5g of fat , 26g of carbs ( 3g of fiber ) , 2g of protein
These directions called for 8 ounces of milk .
I used 2 % milk and was happy to see a hot cocoa made for milk .
I love creamy hot chocolate .
The cocoa melted quickly in the hot milk and smelled delicious , and oh so chocolatey .
There was no white froth , just some bubbles .
It was rich and creamy , like youâ€ ™re drinking melted chocolate .
It was the best , by far .
I was glad I tasted this one last , so that I could drink the entire cup .
If you can get some Godiva Hot Cocoa , please do .
I found it on sale for $ 3.00 but it ’s normally $ 5.00 .
I should have stocked up !
The Godiva is definitely better than the Swiss Miss Chocolate Sensation ( even though the Swiss Miss is very good ) and the Godiva has fewer calories too !
If you canâ€™t afford the $ 1.25 for a cup of Godiva hot cocoa , Swiss Miss Dark Chocolate Sensation is a great choice .
Swiss
Miss really makes some good , inexpensive cocoas – both of the Swiss Miss flavors I tried were really great .
Swiss
Miss makes lots of flavors and I look forward to trying them all .
I think Iâ€™ll save the Godiva Hot Chocolate for special occasions .

BOSTON — After 9/11 , my husband started each morning reaching for the remote and saying , “ Let ’s see if they caught Osama . ”
This greeting began as an expectation , evolved into a lingering hope , and finally deteriorated into irony .
Six years later , our ritual preceded an early morning appearance by the newly trimmed and black - bearded terrorist .
Thus fear descends into farce .
It was no accident that bin Laden timed his videos for Sept. 11 .
But then again , how fitting it was that the hearings on the Iraq war coincided with the anniversary of his attack .
The testimony was dotted with overt and subtle messages about Iraq as the center of the war on terrorism without acknowledging how it became the center .
In opening statements , Ambassador Ryan Crocker used “ al - Qaida ” nine times and Gen. David Petraeus used it 17 times without mentioning that there was no al - Qaida in Iraq before we were in Iraq .
There was nothing new in this false connection .
For that matter , there was no news at all from the hearings , if by “ news ” we mean something unexpected : “ General Bites Commander in Chief . ”
Was there any doubt that Petraeus wanted to keep the “ surge ” troops as long as possible ?
Was there any doubt that Bush would claim to follow the advice of the man he commands and announce plans to withdraw those 30,000 troops by next summer ?
Nevertheless , to my surprise , these hearings did mark a turning point .
In place of swagger , we saw sobriety .
There was no presidential voice in these rooms telling the senators and representatives , as he told the Aussies , “ we ’re kicking ass . ”
The cockeyed optimism of “ Mission Accomplished ” was replaced by the controlled pessimism in Crocker ’s voice as he claimed , simply , that “ success is attainable . ”
One word leaked out of both men repeatedly : “ frustration . ”
It ’s a word that every American shares .
The general who came bearing medals as well as a Ph.D. admitted , “ I ’m as frustrated with the situation as anybody else . ”
But if you need more proof of sobriety , there was the moment of the hearings when Petraeus was asked whether Americans were safer now .
After a pregnant pause , he answered : “ Sir , I do n’t know , actually . ”
This was supposed to be the week of Osama ’s makeover or Bush ’s do - over .
It was the week when the public conversation may have shifted permanently .
We have entered the debate over the lesser of two catastrophes .
Americans gave up the belief in Iraqi WMDs long ago .
Gradually , most of us have given up the idea that we can create democracy in Iraq .
Now we have also lost confidence that the surge can create the “ breathing space ” in which the Iraqis will achieve reconciliation in their disintegrated society .
Mission creep has become “ mission shrink . ”
The real role of American troops in Iraq now is to try and keep a lid on the terrible violence unleashed by our own invasion .
Our job in Iraq , as Crocker put it , is preventing a “ big , nasty street fight . ”
So we get down to the tale of two catastrophes .
On the one hand the war ’s supporters claim only that things will get horrifically worse if we leave .
“ Make no mistake , ” said John McCain , “ the consequences of American defeat in Iraq will be terrible and long - lasting . ”
On the other hand , the war ’s opponents insist that staying the course will only stay the disaster .
All we get from prolonging the war are more casualties of the war .
“ Buy time ? ” asked Chuck Hagel , the Nebraska Republican retiring from the Senate .
“ For what ? ”
These clashing catastrophes will be the central theme of the next presidential election .
The choices facing voters will be these : Chaos in Iraq , or casualties in America .
The forces of terrorism let loose in the world , or the real war against terrorism distracted by the war in Iraq .
One side will ask how we can justify the massacres and mayhem that may well follow our departure .
The other side will ask how we can justify asking one more , or 1,000 , or 5,000 Americans to die — for what ?
A mistake .
Between these two unbearable options , I choose leaving .
But any choice comes with a bitter recognition of the financial , moral and political fallout from this president ’s decision and deception .
In Robert Draper ’s aptly named book on the Bush presidency , “ Dead Certain , ” the president muses on his retirement .
“ I ’ll give some speeches , just to replenish the ol ’ coffers , ” he says .
“ We ’ll have a nice place in Dallas , ” he adds , where he will run “ a fantastic Freedom Institute .
I can just envision getting in the car , getting bored , going down to the ranch . ”
Just think .
Osama is on the loose with his hair stylist .
Iraq is coming apart at the seams .
How swell that one American has an exit strategy .

How Rainbow Tables work
I found the creator of Rainbow Table 's paper , aimed at cryptanalysts , was pretty inaccessible considering the simplicity and elegance of Rainbow Tables , so this is an overview of it for a layman .
Hash functions map plaintext to hashes so that you can't tell a plaintext from its hash .
If you want to find a given plaintext for a certain hash there are two simple methods :
- Hash each plaintext one by one , until you find the hash .
- Hash each plaintext one by one , but store each generated hash in a sorted table so that you can easily look the hash up later without generating the hashes again
Going one by one takes a very long time , and storing each hash takes an amount of memory which simply does n't exist ( for all but the smallest of plaintext sets ) .
Rainbow tables are a compromise between pre-computation and low memory usage .
The key to understanding rainbow tables is understanding the ( unhelpfully named ) reduction function .
A hash function maps plaintexts to hashes , the reduction function maps hashes to plaintexts .
It 's important to note that it does the reverse of a hash function ( mapping hashes to plaintexts ) , but it is / not / an inverse hash function .
The whole purpose of hash functions is that inverse hash functions can't be made .
If you take the hash of a plaintext , and take the reduction of the hash , it will not give you the original plaintext ; but some other plaintext .
If the set of plaintexts is [ 0123456789 ]
{6 } ( we want a rainbow table of all numeric passwords of length 6 ) , and the hashing function is MD5 ( ) , a hash of a plaintext might be MD5 ( " 493823 " ) -> " 222f00dc4b7f9131c89cff641d1a8c50 " .
In this case the reduction function R( ) might be as simple as taking the first six numbers from the hash ; R( " 222f00dc4b7f9131c89cff641d1a8c50 " ) -> " 222004 " .
We now have generated another plaintext from the hash of the previous plaintext , this is the purpose of the reduction function .
Hashes are one - way functions , and so are reduction functions .
The chains which make up rainbow tables are chains of one way hash and reduction functions starting at a certain plaintext , and ending at a certain hash .
A chain in a rainbow table starts with an arbitrary plaintext , hashes it , reduces the hash to another plaintext , hashes the new plaintext , and so on .
The table only stores the starting plaintext , and the final hash you choose to end with , and so a chain " containing " millions of hashes can be represented with only a single starting plaintext , and a single finishing hash .
After generating many chains the table might look something like :
iaisudhiu -> 4259cc34599c530b1e4a8f225d665802
oxcvioix -> c744b1716cbf8d4dd0ff4ce31a177151
9da8dasf -> 3cd696a8571a843cda453a229d741843
[...]
sodifo8sf -> 7ad7d6fa6bb4fd28ab98b3dd33261e8f
The chains are now ready to be used .
We have a certain hash with an unknown plaintext , and we want to check to see whether it is inside any of the generated chains .
The algorithm is :
Look for the hash in the list of final hashes , if it is there break out of the loop .
If it is n't there reduce the hash into another plaintext , and hash the new plaintext .
Goto the start .
If the hash matches one of the final hashes , the chain for which the hash matches the final hash contains the original hash .
In this way you check through the hashes in the chains , which are n't actually stored anywhere on disk , by iterating column by column through the table of chains , backwards from the last column in the chain , to the starting plaintext .
If you wanted to check whether the hash exists in the last column of any of the chains you reduce and hash the given hash once , then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes .
You can check the second last column by reducing and hashing twice , then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes .
And the third is checked by reducing and hashing three times , then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes .
Supposing a chain ending matches the generated hash the matching chain end might contain the hash .
The starting plaintext which was stored with the ending hash can be reduced and hashed until the correct plaintext is found within the chain .
Collisions are the only problem with Rainbow Tables .
Ironically collisions are seen as a bad thing for hashing algorithms , but in the case of Rainbow Tables a hashing algorithm which generates collisions fairly regularly will be more secure .
Because of these collision problems there is no guarantee that there will be a hash of a plaintext that will reduce to some other given plaintext .
If you have a simple list of hashes and corresponding plaintexts for every plaintext in a set you will know that if you have not found the hash in the generated hashes the plaintext that generated the hash is not in the set .
If you have a table of chains where the reduction function reduces hashes into the set of plaintexts you could have trillions of chains generated but you still may not have generated every plaintext in the set you want to check .
You can only say how probable it is that a table of chains contains a certain plaintext , and this can approach 1 but will probably never reach 1 .
If you have a rainbow table with 10 chains of length 100 you have hashed 1000 plaintexts , but even if there are only 100 plaintexts in the set of desired plaintexts the 1000 hashes you have in the chains may not contain all the desired hashes .
The way collisions are handled is what sets Rainbow Tables apart from its predecessor which was developed in 1980 .
The predecessor solved the problem of certain plaintexts never being reduced to by using many small tables .
Each small table uses a different reduction function .
This does n't solve the problem completely , but it does help .
To solve chain merges and loops each chain ended at a " distinct point " ; a hash which was unique in some way , eg hashes where the first 4 characters are 0 .
The chains keep on going until it reaches a distinct point .
If two chains end up at the same distinct point then there has been a collision somewhere in the chain , and one of the chains is discarded .
If a chain is generated for an unusually long time without reaching a distinct point a loop is suspected ( where a chain of hashes ends up reducing and hashing to a previous hash in the chain ) .
The problem with this is that if there is a collision there is potentially a whole branch which has to be cut off and wo n't make it into the chains , and a loop will cause all the hashes which came before the loop in the chain to be discarded .
Rainbow tables differ in that they do n't use multiple tables with different reduction functions , they only use one table .
However in Rainbow Tables a different reduction function is used for each column .
This way different tables with different reduction functions are n't needed , because different reduction functions are used within the same table .
It is still unlikely that all plaintexts in the desired set will be hashed , but the chances are higher for a given number of chains .
Chain merges are much , much rarer , because collisions have to occur on the same column .
For a chain of length l the chance of a collision causing a merge is reduced to 1/l .
Loops are also solved , because if a hash in a chain is the same as a previous hash it wo n't reduce to the same plaintext .
The reason they 're called Rainbow Tables is because each column uses a different reduction function .
If each reduction function was a different color , and you have starting plaintexts at the top and final hashes at the bottom , it would look like a rainbow ( a very vertically long and thin one ) .
By using Rainbow Tables the only problem that remains is that you can never be certain that the chains contain all the desired hashes , to get higher success rates from a given Rainbow Table you have to generate more and more chains , and get diminishing returns .
I hope by explaining the Rainbow Table I have n't made them any less wonderful ...
An easy way to improve on the " rainbowcrack " Rainbow Tables implementation
This section probably goes a bit beyond where a layman would be comfortable , but if you 're interested in the practical applications of the above theory or have some interest in cryptography read on ..
The rainbowcrack application is how most people come to learn about Rainbow Tables , because it is the application which puts the theory above into code .
It has been very successful , with many websites dedicated to generating rainbowcrack hash tables and letting users search them .
However there is a pretty clear way this application could be improved , very easily , in the sense that the generated tables would take up a lot less disk space , but be equally as effective for breaking hashes :
Remember above that when you want to generate a certain chain you start from an arbitrary hash .
This just means it does n't matter where you choose to start from .
The rainbowcrack application starts from a randomly generated 64 - bit number .
This number is then used to generate a chain which ultimately ends with a 128 - bit hash , which is reduced to another 64 - bit number .
Why use a randomly generated number as the starting point ?
A pseudo - random number generator can generate a fantastic amount of seemingly random numbers from a single input number .
Why not make a single random input number , and then store the index of the number which generates the pseudo - random number ?
So for example a cipher like RC4 is a pseudo - random number generator .
Say the single input number ( the " seed " , as it's called ) was 18092398 .
The first 64 - bits the RC4 generates might give a number of " 091358029384092 " , to start the chain off .
The second 64 - bits might give a number of " 123793582983480 " , to start the second chain off .
The third 64 - bits might give " 1089324083486 " , for the third chain , and so on potentially for billions of chains .
What is the difference between this and storing a random 64 - bit number for each chain , as rainbowcrack does ?
Simply that a start - point in a rainbowcrack table must be stored as the randomly generated 64 - bit number .
A start - point using a random - number generator needs only the single input number ( the " seed " ) and the chain number .
So when referring to the third chain in the example above , if you wanted to know the start point of " 1089324083486 " , you would only need to know the " seed " number , and that it was the third 64 - bit number generated .
That 's the number " 18092398 " , and the number " 3 " .
To know the start - point for the fourth chain you only need to know the " seed " ( " 18092398 " ) , and the number " 4 " .
If you have 2^64 chains ( 1,844,674,407,370,955,616 ) then it would n't make any difference , but that would be 4194304 terrabytes , far larger than any Rainbow Table ever generated .
For a more realistic rainbow table with , say , 2^28 ( 268,435,456 ) chains you would only need a 28 - bit number instead of storing a 64 - bit number , as rainbowcrack currently does .
That 's an improvement from ( 64 - bit+64 - bit ) per chain to ( 28 - bit+64 - bit ) per chain , plus a single 64 - bit " seed " number per table .
When you 're talking about millions of chains that 's a very significant reduction of data for the same hash - breaking ability .
In this example a rainbowcrack table would be 2^28 * ( 64 - bit random start number + 64 - bit chain - end number ) ( 4096 MB ) .
Using a pseudo - random number generator the table would be 2^28 * ( 28 - bit non-random start number + 64 - bit chain - end number ) + 64 - bit " seed " number ( 3264 MB )
When you scale that difference up to the huge sizes rainbowcrack tables can reach the savings become massive , and you end up with whole hard - disk arrays of randomly - generated chain - start number data that is pure waste , not to mention the bandwidth used moving the data around .
A huge waste considering the trivial code changes .
( Reuters ) - U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in findings released on Monday that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons development program in 2003 .
Following are highlights of the National Intelligence Estimate ’s key judgments .
-- Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted it in 2003 and had not restarted it as of mid-2007 .
The halt applied to design and engineering of an explosive device , such as fuses or shielding , and to covert uranium - conversion activities , according to senior intelligence officials .
Other activities such as civilian uranium enrichment and missile development continue .
-- Iran is keeping open the option of developing nuclear weapons , but U.S. intelligence agencies “ do not know ” whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons .
This is a major change from a 2005 intelligence estimate which concluded that Iran was “ determined to develop nuclear weapons . ”
--
The weapons program was halted in response to international pressure , meaning Tehran may be more susceptible to influence than previously thought .
-- Tehran ’s decisions on nuclear weapons are guided by a consideration of the costs and benefits of its actions , rather than “ a rush to a weapon ” regardless of political and other consequences .
-- Iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon by late 2009 , but this is unlikely and a time frame of 2010 - 2015 is more likely .
-- Iran still faces significant problems operating the centrifuges needed to make enriched uranium , despite progress this year installing them at its Natanz facility .
--
It will be hard to persuade the Iranian leadership to renounce nuclear weapons development altogether .
-- Iran may have imported at least some weapons - grade nuclear fuel but not enough to make a weapon .
It can not be ruled out that Iran has acquired from abroad , or will acquire , a nuclear weapon or sufficient nuclear fuel to make one .
--
Any production of highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons would probably take place at a covert facility rather than a declared nuclear site .
Covert enrichment programs were probably halted in 2003 and had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
-- Iran has the scientific , technical and industrial capacity eventually to produce nuclear weapons if it decides to do so .
Senior intelligence officials said the major hurdle is acquiring sufficient nuclear fuel .

The Absolut vodka company apologized Saturday for an ad campaign depicting the southwestern U.S. as part of Mexico amid angry calls for a boycott by U.S. consumers .
The campaign , which promotes ideal scenarios under the slogan “ In an Absolut World , ” showed a 1830s - era map when Mexico included California , Texas and other southwestern states .
Mexico still resents losing that territory in the 1848 Mexican - American War and the fight for Texas independence .
But the ads , which ran only in Mexico and have since ended , were less than ideal for Americans undergoing a border buildup and embroiled in an emotional debate over illegal immigration from their southern neighbor .

If you have n't heard of The Sims by now then you should probably have your Internet privileges revoked .
It was a game in which you micro-managed and babied a family of petulant and unruly jerks , trying to keep them from burning or electrocuting themselves to death long enough to spend the hour it takes to pee .
The Sims was fun until you had pretty much explored the limits of the game and got tired of your gibberish - screaming posse of louts and ordered them into the pool for a summary execution .
The Sims 2 , recently released by Maxis , brings us a much prettier version of the same , with all new and exciting ways to herd or harm your Sims .
For the purposes of informing our readers , and because I love nothing more than being a sadist in computer games , I have detailed a week in the life of The Sims 2 .
Quite a looker .
The extent of the changes in The Sims 2 over its predecessor will become apparent before you have even begun your first game .
Before you create your family of soon - to - be - headstones you will select one of the three preloaded towns which the game offers .
There is the cheerily generic Pleasantview ( a familiar town to anyone who played the original game ) , Strangetown , a desert landscape full of oddball characters like aliens and hillbilly yokels , and there is Veronaville , ripped from the pages of The Bard for you to find out what sort of damage you can inflict on the romance of Romeo and Juliet .
There is also the option to import maps from Sim City 4 to be populated manually - the game includes a handful of stock maps for this purpose as well - but Christ only knows how long doing all that would take .
I decided to set up shop in Veronaville .
My logic was that it 's good fun to murder various generic Sims in Pleasantville so it should be a whole lot more fun to kill characters from Shakespeare .
I entered the gingerbread hamlet of Veronaville and set about the task of creating the family that I would be wedging between the Capulet and Montague clans .
I wanted to be free to spend as little time as possible micro-managing a big baby so I opted for the bachelor approach .
My family name was " Flayer " and my lone wolf was a dashing chap by the name of " Marduk the " .
Thanks to the truly amazing character customization options , which allow you to select from hundreds of facial features for pretty much limitless combinations , I was able to create the man of my dreams .
Or nightmares as the case turned out to be .
I created Marduk with a recessed nose , a face so thin the cheeks clipped through the polygons of his teeth , gigantic blue eyes , and impossibly elongated facial features .
For finishing touches I added a large mustache that stretched out across his face until it resembled a wig for his equine mouth and about five pounds of glittering whore - paint makeup .
When I was through Marduk the Flayer looked like a cross between a cartoon horse and a combat knife .
A king needs a castle .
After you design the physical features of your Sims you move on to selecting their clothing for various situations .
You have a default outfit , a formal outfit , underwear , a bathing suit , and athletic clothes .
I decked Marduk out in a dapper red smoking jacket and made sure every other clothing option featured him in the most revealing attire I could select .
With that finished I set his attributes and aspiration .
Aspirations are new to the Sims and determine the daily goals of your character , think of them as mini-quests by which your Sims can earn reward points and stay happy .
I made Marduk a lazy and slovenly Casanova with the romance aspiration .
Luckily for him his hideous goddamn face would not factor into the many romances he would try to form .
After creating Marduk I had my run of Veronaville in which to set up shop .
The pre-made houses seemed far too conventional for a free spirit like Marduk so I mapped out a plot and moved him in there .
Marduk and I both surveyed the empty lot , contemplating what sort of structure , what edifice , would be appropriate for a man of his stature .
I knew that the meager resources allotted a starting family would be insufficient so I called upon the shadowy powers of the dark gods to give Marduk the venture capital to establish himself adequately .
Then I plunged head - first into the house builder .
Immediately I was disappointed by the lack of support for the non-Euclidian geometry of Marduk 's hellishly indescribable home dimension .
There would be no 5 - D octagulon twisting and distorting in midair for Marduk to return home to after a hard day 's work .
Instead I began with a protective moat around the property , reinforcing it with a dismayingly small curtain wall which would hopefully keep out enraged mobs .
For Marduk 's abode I constructed a five story octagonal tower , built from sinister basalt , with all of the amenities necessary on the five internal floors and a fifth rooftop temple dedicated to Marduk 's almighty grandfather Eridu .
I furnished this with the dead - eyed stares of a cadre of pink - furred Bearlybutts , waiting for the harvest of souls Marduk was soon to reap .
" Oh , yes , I am listening to everything you are saying .
" No sooner had I turned Marduk loose in his new home than a neighborhood welcoming party arrived demanding his attention .
Marduk seemed content to stare in wonder at the telephone on the fourth floor but I ordered him down to greet his guests .
The first to greet the Flayer was an elfin ( literally ) woman named Titania , no doubt summering in Veronaville to escape the dreadful heat of the fairy world .
She and Marduk seemed quite taken with one another , but I pressed him to greet the rest of the guests and he seemed similarly taken with the cleavage of a friendly blonde woman .
The visitors headed inside uninvited to waste Marduk 's electricity while the Flayer tried to put the moves on the blonde .
She was less than receptive , but luckily a passerby caught Marduk 's attention .
None other than smitten teen Juliet was wandering past the unholy tower of Marduk the Flayer and after an exchange of words they became fast friends .
Much to Marduk 's consternation romance was not to be found with Juliet , as statutory rape laws in Veronaville appear to be enforced by some sort of brain implant .
It would not be unfair to surmise that Marduk , once he realized his predicament , earmarked the fair Juliet for darker pursuits than the so - called " Woohoo " .
Since Marduk had dead - ended with Juliet I had him look for a job while he was still outside .
According to his aspirations he wanted a job as a slacker and luckily for him the local slacker factory was hiring .
After the guests had departed Marduk trained his surgeon 's fingers on the piano and dined alone with insect - like efficiency on a TV dinner .
Marduk then made the fateful decision to eat a second TV dinner , causing a fire in his oven that required his constant panicky attention .
Luckily , a firefighter was summoned automatically by the smoke detector I had thoughtfully installed , sparing Marduk harm but costing him well over two hours of time as he watched enthralled by the fire and the firefighter .
No , the joke is on YOU Kent !
By the time the fire had been extinguished and Marduk had calmed down a warning popped up informing me that a car would be arriving for Marduk in an hour .
I rushed him to the bathroom to scrub off his accumulated filth just in time for him to finish and hurry down to the waiting car .
When he arrived home the following morning he spent his first sleep in Veronaville sprawled across a curb , his eyes so large they would not close , his head lolling madly on the bare concrete .
After recuperating from his disastrous first day Marduk wanted to invite his underage friend Juliet over .
Marduk called her and she insisted on bringing over a friend .
I believe his name was Kent , although he and Marduk did n't spend much time together on account of Kent and Juliet 's interest in playing SSX with each other .
While Marduk was scheduling maid and gardening service Kent decided to take a little journey upstairs .
I had almost forgotten about him , what with micro-managing Marduk 's phone conversations , when I heard a toilet flush .
I sprung into action , erecting a brick wall around Kent and the toilet with large observation windows so that Marduk and I could monitor Kent 's " progress " .
I removed the toilet and placed it in an unoccupied area of the bathroom .
" Nuclear weapons should never fall into the hands of Islamists .
Despite the current unstable situation , there is not yet any concrete risk ( that it could happen ) but the situation has to be put right for that to remain true , " Steinmeier told weekly Bild am Sonntag in an interview to be published Sunday .
Steinmeier is n't the only one fretting about Pakistan 's nuclear weapons
" We will discuss what we can do to this end with the United Nations , the United States and the Europeans , " he added .
" We are horrified by the cruel attack " which cost former prime minister Bhutto her life and " which has created a situation which
could lead to the most serious crisis in the history of Pakistan , " he said .
He called on Pakistani politicians " to work together now to stand up to the ( Islamist ) fundamentalists . "
West concerned by Pakistan unrest
Steinmeier 's comments reflect growing concerns among Western leaders about Pakistan 's slide into violence after Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Dec. 27 .
More than 40 people have been killed in Pakistan in rioting and shootings as inflamed supporters of Bhutto went on the rampage in several cities and towns .
Violence continued on Saturday , Dec 29 , as protesters in the southern province of Sindh , Bhutto 's political stronghold , torched shops , lorries , welfare centres and ambulances .
Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally
Bhutto's killing has also thrown into doubt whether Pakistan can hold an election in 10 days time that was meant to complete a transition to civilian rule .
The United States and other Western allies have urged President Pervez Musharraf to press ahead with polls they hope will bring stability to a country emerging from eight years of military rule while facing growing violence from Islamist militants allied to al Qaeda .
Pakistan 's nuclear status sparks jitters
But it 's the thought of Pakistan 's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands that has sparked profound unease in the West .
France echoed Germany 's concerns over Pakistan 's nuclear capability falling into the hands of extremists and the killing threatening stability throughout South Asia .
" That is why we regard Pakistan and the odious assassination of
Benazir Bhutto in part as an assassination of democracy ... and we
must not allow that , " said French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
In addition to bordering volatile Afghanistan , al Qaeda 's sway in the country 's tribal areas and its reputation as a breeding ground for Islamists , Pakistan remains the only Muslim country known to have nuclear weapons .
The country carried out its first nuclear test in 1998 and claims to have about 80 to 120 warheads .
Pakistan 's nuclear weapons are stored in bunkers in about half - a- dozen military bases .
Founder of Pakistan 's nuclear program , Abdul Qadeer Khan
Pakistan 's image was dealt a massive blow in 2004 when it emerged that its chief nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan had been peddling nuclear equipment on a global black market .
Khan confessed to passing atomic secrets to Iran , Libya and North Korea .
He was pardoned by Musharraf but remains under virtual house arrest .
But analysts said Pakistan 's military was firmly in control of the nuclear arsenal and that it was unlikely al Qaeda or Taliban militants could get hold of the weapon components and missiles , which are kept separately .
Leonard Spector , deputy director of the James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies told news agency AFP he thought the risk of weapons falling into rogue hands was slight .
" Pakistan 's weapons are under the control of the military and by and large that will remain unchanged , I think .
From a standpoint of security we 'll probably have continuity and relatively satisfactory control , " he said .
Not advisable to travel to Pakistan
The chaos and violence in Pakistan has prompted many Western governments to advise their citizens against traveling to Pakistan .
A travel update on the German Foreign Ministry 's website said it was advisable to delay visits to Pakistan until the situation had calmed .
Supporters throng Bhutto's coffin before her burial
The chairman of the German parliament 's foreign affairs committee , Ruprecht Polenz , said he feared the assassination would push the country towards anarchy .
Polenz said in a radio interview that it was important for the population to heed President Pervez Musharraf 's call for calm in order not to exacerbate the situation .
German parliamentarian Sebastian Edathy , who is travelling to
Pakistan as an official observer of the forthcoming elections , told
German news agency dpa that the country was at a decisive moment .
Edathy warned that the stability of the entire region depended on
Pakistan and he recommended sticking to the January 8 polling date , as postponing it would leave the country without legitimate political leadership for even longer .
In a McCain vs. Billary race , the Democrats will sacrifice the most highly desired commodity by the entire electorate , change ; the party will be mired in déjà 1990s all over again .
Mrs. Clinton ’s spiel about being “ tested ” by her “ 35 years of experience ” wo n’t fly either .
The moment she attempts it , Mr. McCain will run an ad about how he was being tested when those 35 years began , in 1973 .
It was that spring when he emerged from five - plus years of incarceration at the Hanoi Hilton while Billary was still bivouacked at Yale Law School .
And can Mrs. Clinton presume to sell herself as best equipped to be commander in chief “ on Day One ” when opposing an actual commander and war hero ?
I do n’t think so .
Foreign policy issue No. 1 , withdrawal from Iraq , should be a slam - dunk for any Democrat .
Even the audience at Thursday ’s G.O.P. debate in Boca Raton cheered Ron Paul ’s antiwar sentiments .
But Mrs. Clinton ’s case is undermined by her record .
She voted for the war , just as Mr. McCain did , in 2002 and was still defending it in February 2005 , when she announced from the Green Zone that much of Iraq was “ functioning quite well .
” Only in November 2005 did she express the serious misgivings long pervasive in her own party .
When Mr. McCain accuses her of now advocating “ surrender ” out of political expediency , her flip - flopping will back him up .
Billary can’t even run against the vast right - wing conspiracy if Mr. McCain is the opponent .
Rush Limbaugh and Tom DeLay hate Mr. McCain as much as they hate the Clintons .
And they hate him for the same reasons Mr. McCain wins over independents and occasional Democrats : his sporadic ( and often mild ) departures from conservative orthodoxy on immigration and campaign finance reform , torture , tax cuts , climate change and the godliness of Pat Robertson .
Since Mr. McCain does n’t kick reporters like dogs , as the Clintons do , he will no doubt continue to enjoy an advantage , however unfair , with the press pack on the Straight Talk Express .
Even so , Mr. McCain has n’t yet won a clear majority of Republican voters in any G.O.P. contest .
He ’s depended on the kindness of independent voters .
Tuesday ’s Florida primary , which is open exclusively to Republicans , is his crucial test .
If he fails , his party remains in chaos and Mitt Romney could still inherit the earth .
That would be a miracle for the Democrats , but they can hardly count on it .
If Mr. Obama has not met an unexpected Waterloo in South Carolina  this column went to press before Saturday ’s vote  the party needs him to stop whining about the Clintons ’ attacks , regain his wit and return to playing offense .
Unlike Mrs. Clinton , he would unambiguously represent change in a race with any Republican .
If he vanquishes Billary , he ’ll have an even stronger argument to take into battle against a warrior like Mr. McCain .
If Mr. Obama does n’t fight , no one else will .
Few national Democratic leaders have the courage to stand up to the Clintons .
Even in defeat , Mr. Obama may at least help wake up a party slipping into denial .
Any Democrat who seriously thinks that Bill will fade away if Hillary wins the nomination  let alone that the Clintons will escape being fully vetted  is a Democrat who , as the man said , believes in fairy tales .
The Bush Administration and DC Gun Ownership
by John R. Lott , Jr. by John R. Lott , Jr.
DIGG THIS
A lot of Americans who believe in the right to own guns were very disappointed this weekend .
On Friday , the Bush administration ’s Justice Department entered into the fray over the District of Columbia ’s 1976 handgun ban by filing a brief to the Supreme Court that effectively supports the ban .
The administration pays lip service to the notion that the Second Amendment protects gun ownership as an individual right ,  but their brief leaves the term essentially meaningless .
Quotes by the two sides ’ lawyers say it all .
The District ’s acting attorney general , Peter Nickles , happily noted that the Justice Department ’s brief was a somewhat surprising and very favorable development .
Alan Gura , the attorney who will be representing those challenging the ban before the Supreme Court , accused the Bush administration of basically siding with the District of Columbia and said that  This is definitely hostile to our position . 
As the lead to an article in the Los Angeles Times said Sunday , gun- control advocates never expected to get a boost from the Bush administration . 
As probably the most prominent Second Amendment law professor in the country privately confided in me ,  If the Supreme Court accepts the solicitor general ’s interpretation , the chances of getting the D.C. gun ban struck down are bleak . 
The Department of Justice argument can be boiled down pretty easily .
Its lawyers claim that since the government bans machine guns , it should also be able to ban handguns .
After all , they reason , people can still own rifles and shotguns for protection , even if they have to be stored locked up .
The Justice Department even seems to accept that trigger locks are not really that much of a burden , and that the locks can properly be interpreted  as not interfering with using guns for self - protection .
Yet , even if gun locks do interfere with self - defense , DOJ believes the regulations should be allowed , as long as the District of Columbia government thinks it has a good reason .
Factually , there are many mistakes in the DOJ ’s reasoning :
As soon as a rifle or shotgun is unlocked , it becomes illegal in D.C. , and there has never been a federal ban on machine guns .
But these are relatively minor points .
Nor does it really matter that the only academic research on the impact of trigger locks on crime finds that states that require guns be locked up and unloaded face a five - percent increase in murder and a 12 - percent increase in rape .
Criminals are more likely to attack people in their homes , and those attacks are more likely to be successful .
Since the potential of armed victims deters criminals , storing a gun locked and unloaded actually encourages crime .
The biggest problem is the standard used for evaluating the constitutionality of regulations .
The DOJ is asking that a different , much weaker standard be used for the Second Amendment than the courts demands for other individual rights  such as speech , unreasonable searches and seizures , imprisonment without trial , and drawing and quartering people .
If one accepts the notion that gun ownership is an individual right , what does  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed  mean ?
What would the drafters of the Bill of Rights have had to write if they really meant the right  shall not be infringed  ?
Does the phrase  the right of the people provide a different level of protection in the Second Amendment than in the First and Fourth ?
But the total elimination of gun control is not under consideration by the Supreme Court .
The question is what constitutes reasonable regulation .
The DOJ brief argues that if the DC government says gun control is important for public safety , it should be allowed by the courts .
What the appeals court argued is that gun regulations not only need to be reasonable , they need to withstand  strict scrutiny  — a test that ensures the regulations are narrowly tailored to achieve the desired goal .
Perhaps the Justice Department ’s position is n’t too surprising .
Like any other government agency , it has a hard time giving up its authority .
The Justice Department ’s bias can been seen in that it finds it necessary to raise the specter of machine guns 10 times when evaluating a law that bans handguns .
Nor does the brief even acknowledge that after the ban , D.C. ’s murder rate only once fell below what it was in 1976 .
Worried about the possibility that a Supreme Court decision supporting the Second Amendment as an individual right could cast doubt on the constitutionality of existing federal legislation ,  the Department of Justice felt it necessary to head off any restrictions on government power right at the beginning .
But all is not lost .
The Supreme Court can of course ignore the Bush administration ’s advice , but the brief does carry significant weight .
President Bush has the power to fix this by ordering that the solicitor general brief be withdrawn or significantly amended .
Unfortunately , it may take an uprising by voters to rein in the Justice Department .

Research funded by the Foundation for Research , Science and Technology is sparking a Revolution in Solar Power .
Green Dye Solar Promises to be the next big thing in Alternative Energy with a cost of production that could be 90 % less than conventional Silicon Solar Cells and work efficiently in low diffuse light conditions and even cloudy weather .
Dye - sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) are a novel approach to Solar Energy concieved out of the frustration with stagnating technology centered around Silicon based cells that have been used since the early 1970 ’s and have shown no significant drop in manufacturing cost in over 20 years .
Frustration and stagnation can be extremely motivating forces and it has lead researchers back to green , the color that makes a leaf about 30 - 40 % efficient at photosynthesis .
The Green Dye used to make the new photovoltaic devices has a synthetic chlorophyll made from the light - harvesting pigment plants use for photosynthesis .
The dye molecules coat tiny metal oxide particles that are fused together into a thin film .
The green dye molecules capture spectral light energy and release electrons , the particles act like electrical nano wires and carry the electrons through to an electrical circuit .
The metal used in the cell is Titanium dioxide a plentiful cheap non-toxic white mineral used in many consumer products even toothpaste and cosmetics .
If you recall , we started this thread on Christmas day with a short story about an infected digital photo frame purchased at a Sam's Club .
We were contacted by the Wal - Mart 's security team ( Sam 's Club is owned by Wal - Mart ) a few days later .
They were aware of the problem as a result of reading our diary but could not replicate it with any frames they tested .
We also contacted the distributer of the frames ( Advanced Design Systems ) and they could not duplicate the problem either .
Since that original story we published an update on January 4th asking if anybody had seen similar problems with any device recently purchased that used a USB connection to communicate with a host computer .
That led to a second update on January 7th that contained more details about other devices that were infected .
Since then , more devices have been reported to the Internet Storm Center as being infected with malware and there have been a few media reports .
Of interest is a report this past week saying that Best Buy pulled thousands of digital photo frames from their shelves based on the presence of malware .
The supplier of the frames , Insignia , posted the technical information on their web site .
One of our readers observed that the photo frames purchased at Sam's Club have remote controls remarkably similar to the ones sold at Best Buy .
Check it out yourself :
Best Buy 's frame and remote , distributed by Insignia .
Sam's Club 's remote , distributed by Advanced Design Systems
The remotes are not exactly the same but the similarities are striking .
This led our reader to ponder whether there are more commonalities in these devices .
He suggested that looking at the two motherboards might offer clues .
So if anybody has both the ADS and the Insignia frames in their possession and do n't mind cracking them open ...
Here is what we know so far :
Five digital photo frames from Advanced Design System were bought at various Sam's Clubs containing malware .
Best Buy pulled from the shelves several thousand digital photo frames from Insignia that contained malware .
Our readers reported more malware found on other devices such as a set of MP3 playing sunglasses ( store where sold is not known ) a 250 GB Maxtor External One Touch Backup from Radio Shack a " Flip Video Camera " from a California Costco a MemoryVue 1040 Plus digital photo frame from Digital Spectrum Incorporated that was purchased at a Canadian Costco an 8 - inch Castleton digital photo frame from Uniek that was purchased at a Target a Maxtor One Touch 250GB external hard drive purchased at Fry 's Electronics
We do not think that these situations are related but they do paint a picture of a new attack vector , the supply chain .
By the supply chain , we mean this process :
Factory -> Shipping -> Distributer -> Shipping -> Warehouse -> Shipping -> Retail Store ->
Customer
Several readers have submitted ideas about how these devices got infected :
The user 's computer was already infected but the user did not know it
The device was infected by a customer then returned to the store where it was repackaged and resold
A store employee infected the device as a prank
A customer infected the device as a prank
The retail store is not " clean " but checked returned electronics items with an infected computer , thus spreading malware from one returned product to another
The distributer or the warehouse infected the device
One or more of the shipping companies infected the device
It was infected at the factory
Whatever the cause , there seems to be some sort of breakdown in the security of the supply chain .
It 's easy for retailers to blame the consumers but when the same malware shows up on products purchased at retail stores hundreds of miles apart by different customers it raises serious questions about the true source of the malware .
A final thought .
Many readers are aware of the penetration tests done about two years ago with USB memory sticks that were sprinkled around a victim site to see if employees would bring them in then plug them into corporate computers .
Knowing what you know now about this attack vector , how many digital photo frames are floating around your office that have already been plugged into your corporate computers ?
More information about disabling the Autoplay function of Microsoft Windows is available at Microsoft 's Technet site .

At Wednesday ’s night debate for Republican presidential candidates , one of the more notable exchanges pitted Mitt Romney and John McCain on the issue of torture .
Romney , flustered , struggled to explain his position on waterboarding .
McCain , confident , claimed the high ground : “ I would hope that we would understand , my friends , that life is not 24 and Jack Bauer .
Life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective . "
The crowd in the auditorium applauded .
The collection of undecided Republican voters GOP pollster Frank Luntz assembled for a focus group was far less pleased .
Now , for the uninitiated : dials are little hand - held machines that enable a focus group member to register instantaneous approval or disapproval as the watch a candidate on TV .
There are limitations to the technology : all a candidate has to do is mention , say , Abraham Lincoln and the dials go off into the stratosphere .
Film of soaring eagles will have the same effect .
But the technology does have its uses . [ … ]
When John McCain started talking about torture — specifically , about waterboarding — the dials plummeted again .
Lower even than for the illegal Children of God .
Down to the low 20s , which , given the natural averaging of a focus group , is about as low as you can go .
Afterwards , Luntz asked the group why they seemed to be in favor of torture .
“ I do n’t have any problem pouring water on the face of a man who killed 3000 Americans on 9/11 , ” said John Shevlin , a retired federal law enforcement officer .
The group applauded , appallingly .
Have I mentioned lately that the Republican base is a scary facet of American society ?

When applied to biology , evolution generally refers to changes in life forms over time .
" The Theory of Biological Evolution " is a term used to refer to the proposition that all forms of life on earth are related through common descent , that inheritable traits are passed on from parent organisms to their offspring , that some changes naturally arise when organisms have offspring , and that over time these changes have resulted in the variety of life that we see on earth today .
The Theory of Biological Evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin , because it was Charles Darwin that proposed the mechanism of natural selection and accompanied that proposition with a large volume of empirical data providing evidence for biological evolution .
Darwin was not , however , the first person to propose an evolutionary explanation for the diversity of life on earth .
In fact , evolutionary concepts about life date far back into history and arose in many different cultures .
The Greeks developed a concept of evolution over 2,300 years ago that was basically equivalent to that of Charles Darwin's , but the early Christians opposed the idea and destroyed all of the works that promoted it or any other naturalistic explanations for earthly phenomena .
Origin Mythology
There are literally thousands of different mythological stories about the origin of the world and of life .
There are several common themes in origin mythology , but there are many different means by which the universe , earth , life , and man have come into being throughout the various different origin myths .
The importance and role of origin mythology has varied widely from culture to culture throughout history as well .
In many archaic cultures origin mythology was not central to the belief system , nor were the origin myths fully thought - out to a logical conclusion .
In societies that did not have writing , origin myths , like all of the other myths , were passed down orally , and often served as a form of entertainment as well as a means of passing on beliefs that were important to the society .
When looking at origin myths from around the world several patterns can be observed .
The origin myths of pre-agricultural societies tend to place humans and animals in close relations , while the origin myths of agricultural societies tend describe a separate creation of humans .
Some of the beliefs about humans and animals that are expressed in various origin myths include beliefs that :
Animals transformed into people , humans were born from animals , the gods were animals or part - man / part - animals , there was a time when animals were civilized , humans and animals share spirits , humans are reincarnated as animals or animals as humans .
Among more technologically advanced societies , where separation between humans and other animals was more pronounced and where humans had domesticated animals , themes such as the domination of man over animals , the separate creation of man from animals , and the creation of animals for the use of man are common themes in origin mythology .
Australian Aboriginal culture is thought to be the oldest continuous culture in the world , due to the isolation of the Australian continent .
The mythology of the Aboriginal Australians is also thought to be reflective of some of man 's earliest mythology .
Below is one telling of Aboriginal Australian origin mythology .
In the beginning the earth was a bare plain .
All was dark .
There was no life , no death .
The sun , the moon , and the stars slept beneath the earth .
All the eternal ancestors slept there , too , until at last they woke themselves out of their own eternity and broke through to the surface .
When the eternal ancestors arose , in the Dreamtime , they wandered the earth , sometimes in animal form - as kangaroos , or emus , or lizards -- sometimes in human shape , sometimes part animal and human , sometimes as part human and plant .
Two such beings , self - created out of nothing , were the Ungambikula .
Wandering the world , they found half - made human beings .
They were made of animals and plants , but were shapeless bundles , lying higgledy - piggledy , near where water holes and salt lakes could be created .
The people were all doubled over into balls , vague and unfinished , without limbs or features .
With their great stone knives , the Ungambikula carved heads , bodies , legs , and arms out of the bundles .
They made the faces , and the hands and feet .
At last the human beings were finished .
Thus every man and woman was transformed from nature and owes allegiance to the totem of the animal or the plant that made the bundle they were created from -- such as the plum tree , the grass seed , the large and small lizards , the parakeet , or the rat .
This work done , the ancestors went back to sleep .
Some of them returned to underground homes , others became rocks and trees .
The trails the ancestors walked in the Dreamtime are holy trails .
Everywhere the ancestors went , they left sacred traces of their presence -- a rock , a waterhole , a tree .
For the Dreamtime does not merely lie in the distant past , the Dreamtime is the eternal Now. source : http://www.crystalinks.com/australiacreation.html
This origin myth , like many archaic myths , demonstrates the concept of a common ancestry between humans and other animals .
In many Native American and Asian mythologies there is no specific creator god or act of creation , instead the world is said to have formed out of chaos , and the development of life is said to be a product of some spirit force .
This spirit force is often said in these belief systems to be ever - present and continually acting .
Native American mythology generally presents humans and animals as being related and having common ancestry .
Many different Native American cultures discovered and interpreted fossils and integrated the knowledge of fossils into their origin mythology .
Various origin myths can be identified as having come from Asia , but origin mythology has not held an important role in Asia for many centuries .
This is largely because much of Asia came to be dominated by Buddhism , Taoism , and Confucianism , all of which are highly philosophical and say little or nothing about origins .
" Animism " was common among the European and Asian cultures of pre-historic Eurasia and persisted into relatively recent times in some parts , until it ultimately came into conflict with Christianity .
Many of the ancient European cultures , such as the Celts , the Huns , those of the Scandinavians , and many others , believed in a common tie between the " animal " and " human " world .
Indeed for many there was no separation at all .
This is one reason why the wearing of animal hides was a common ritual practice among the so - called " barbarian " tribes of Europe .
It was precisely this belief in the unity of the human and animal world that that was seen as " pagan " and primitive by later Christians of the Roman Empire and post - imperial Romanized societies .
The belief that humans and the animal world are united has been one of the major beliefs that Christians have worked to stamp out over the past two millennia of Christian expansionism .
First throughout Europe , and then throughout North and South America , Christians have come into conflict with cultures that viewed humans as having descended , in some form , either spiritually or bodily , from animals .
In every case Christians have fought intensely for the past 2,000 years to eradicate the belief that humans and animals have a close relationship .
Mesopotamian and Mediterranean Origin Belief Mesopotamia is known as the " cradle of civilization " , and for good reason .
It is in Mesopotamia that writing , farming , and the domestication of animals is thought to have first taken place .
Civilization from this region had wide ranging impacts on the surrounding area as the practices of writing , farming , domestication , law , and coinage spread east and west to influence other cultures .
It is also from Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean that we find the most developed creation myths that tell of a separate creation of man and of the domination of man over the rest of the animal world .
The Sumerians , because they were the first to develop writing , recorded one of the oldest known origin myths .
Sumerian mythology tells that the gods lived on earth where they worked and toiled .
After some time , the gods grew tired of working so they created humans to do their work for them .
In Sumerian mythology a team of six gods created humans from a special mud .
During the creation several different " defective " people were made , ( non-sexual , sterile , diseased , and blind ) explaining why it is that such afflicted people exist on the earth .
Animals , in this case , already existed and were of a completely separate origin .
The people were made in the image of the gods , to be like the gods , but they were mortal and imperfect .
This mythology tells that people were created for the purpose of laboring and ruling over the animals and farm fields .
In a major telling of Babylonian creation myth , Enuma Elish , which was based on the Sumerian story , the primary Babylonian god Marduk is credited with directing the creation of the heavens and the earth through six cycles and creating man as the final and ultimate act of his creation .
The purpose of creation , again , was to remove the burden of work from the gods by creating humans in the form of gods to take on the burden of work .
In the Babylonian myth the blood of Kingu , a god who led a rebellion against Marduk , was used to create mankind .
His [ Marduk 's ] heart prompts him to create ingenious things .
He conveys his idea to Ea ,
Imparting the plan which he had conceived in his heart :
' Blood will I form and cause bone to be ;
Then will I set up a savage , Man shall be his name !
Yes , I will create mankind !'
Upon him shall the services of the gods be imposed that they may be at rest .
...
Kingu it was who created the strife ,
And caused Tiamat to rebel and prepare for battle .
They [ the gods ] bound him and held him before Ea ;
Punishment they inflicted upon him by cutting the arteries of his blood .
With his blood they created mankind ;
He [ Ea ] imposed the services of the gods upon them and set the gods free .
After Ea , the wise , had created mankind ,
And they had imposed the services of the gods upon them -
That work was not suited to human understanding ;
In accordance with the ingenious plans of Marduk did Nudimmud [ Ea ] create it .
- Enuma Elish , ~1700 BCE
In the Sumerian myth the humans have no divinity , but in the Babylonian myth people are given partial divinity by their creation from the blood of a god , but the god from which they were made was rebellious and deceitful , thus giving the explanation for the " negative " aspects of human behavior .
Like the creation myths of the Sumerians and Babylonians , the creation myth of the Hebrews tells of a separate and special creation of man .
In the Hebrew myth man is also given dominion over the plant and animal kingdoms .
25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
26 And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
27 So God created man in his own image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
28 And God blessed them , and God said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
29 And God said , Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
30 And to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
- Genesis 1 , ~440 BCE
It is also worthy of note that the Genesis myth , like the Sumerian and Babylonian myths ( as well as other Mesopotamian myths ) , mentions the existence of cattle ( domesticated animals ) at the time of creation .
All of these myths were obviously influenced by the fact that their civilizations had control over animals .
Importantly as well , all of these myths reflect the fact that these were civilizations where work was portrayed as the objective of life .
Moving from the mythical and religious realm to the philosophical , the Greeks made substantial philosophical arguments in favor of a universe created and designed by a creator god for the use of man .
Many different schools of philosophy developed in Greece .
Stoicism was a Greek school of philosophy that , while ostensibly non-religious and anti-superstitious , viewed the universe as being intelligently designed by a rational creator , who continued to govern the universe through his divine providence .
In 45 BCE the Roman statesman Cicero wrote a masterful summary of the boldest elements of Greek philosophy , The Nature of the Gods .
In the tradition of his time the work was written in dialog format .
In The Nature Cicero put forward the positions of the major schools of Greek philosophy relating to gods , the universe , and life .
The Nature was a widely read work by Roman scholars and early Roman Christians ; such men as Saint Augustine were influenced by the work .
The Nature also , of course , reflects the views and opinions that prevailed in Mediterranean society shortly before the birth of Christianity .
In The Nature Cicero summarized the arguments for and against views , including those of Platonic Stoics , that the universe was created by an intelligent force for the use of man , and thus the book serves as a good window into that school of philosophy .
[ W ] ho would ascribe the intelligence of a man to him who when he saw such regularity in the movements of the heavens , such stability in the order of the stars , such interconnection and mutual coherence in all things , denied the presence of any reason in these , and described as the result of chance things which are administered with a skill to which we cannot by any skill attain ?
Or is it that when we see anything such as a globe , or horologe , or numerous other things , moving by means of some kind of mechanism , we make no question of their being the work of intelligence , and yet are skeptical , although we see the heavens rushing on with marvelous speed , and bringing about with the utmost regularity the yearly recurring changes of the seasons by their revolution , ensuring thereby the most complete well - being and preservation of all things , — are we , I say , skeptical as to such phenomena being the result not merely of intelligence , but of an intelligence which is exalted and divine ?
For we may now set aside the refinements of argument , and survey , as it were , with our eyes the beauty of the things which we say were instituted by the divine providence .
And in the first place let us note the earth as a whole , which is situated in the central quarter of the universe , and is solid , spherical , gathered at every point into that shape by its own gravity , and clothed with flowers , herbs , trees , and fruits , the incredible multitude of all these being set off by a variety which cannot tire .
Add to them the cool perennial springs , the liquid transparency of the rivers , the green covering of the banks , the vast hollows of the caves , the rugged rocks , the lofty overhanging mountains , and the boundless plains ; add , too , the hidden veins of gold and silver , and the limitless wealth of marble .
And what tribes of animals , there are , both tame and wild , and how various !
what flights and songs of birds , what grazing of cattle , what forms of woodland life !
How shall I next speak of the race of men , the appointed cultivators , as it were , of the earth , who neither allow it to become the lair of savage beasts , nor to be turned into a waste by a rough undergrowth , and whose handiwork makes bright the fields and islands and coasts , dotting them with houses and cities ?
If we could see these things with our eyes , as we can with our mind , no one , when he gazed upon the earth in its completeness , would doubt as to the divine intelligence .
...
The conclusion is thus reached upon every hand , and from every consideration , that everything in this universe is marvelously administered by the divine intelligence and forethought with a view to the safety and preservation of all things .
But it will be asked for whose sake so vast a work was carried out .
Was it for the sake of trees and herbs , which though without sensation are nevertheless sustained by Nature ?
No , that at any rate is absurd .
Was it for the sake of animals ?
It is equally improbable that the gods went to such pains for beings that are dumb and without understanding .
For whose sake , then , would one say that the universe was formed ?
For the sake , undoubtedly , of those animate beings that exercise reason .
These are gods and men , whom nothing assuredly transcends in excellence , since reason is the highest of all things .
It is thus credibly established that the universe and everything that is in it were made for the sake of gods and men .
- The Nature of the Gods ; Cicero , 45 BCE
This argument , while more sophisticated and philosophically derived , exemplifies the reasoning present in the earlier creation myths of the Sumerians , Babylonians , and certainly the Hebrews , as well as the myths of others .
This reasoning , however , was not the only one present in ancient Greece or presented in The Nature .
Must I not here express my wonder that anyone should exist who persuades himself that there are certain solid and indivisible particles carried along by their own impulse and weight , and that a universe so beautiful and so admirably arrayed is formed from the accidental concourse of those particles ?
I do not understand why the man who supposes that to have been possible should not also think that if a countless number of the forms of the one and twenty letters , whether in gold or any other material , were to be thrown somewhere , it would be possible , when they had been shaken out upon the ground , for the annals of Ennius to result from them so as to be able to be read consecutively , — a miracle of chance which I incline to think would be impossible even in the case of a single verse .
Yet , as the Epicureans assure us , it was from minute particles possessing neither color , nor any kind of quality , nor sensation , but coming together by chance and accident , that the world was produced , or rather that innumerable worlds are , within each instant of time , either coming into being or departing from it .
But if a concourse of atoms is able to form the universe , why cannot they form a portico , or temple , or house , or city , things which are less , far less elaborate ?
- The Nature of the Gods ; Cicero , 45 BCE
Here we see , from over 2,000 years ago , a common argument that is still used against evolution today .
We see this argument in The Nature because the ancient Greeks had already developed a " theory of evolution by natural selection " over 2,000 years ago .
Evolutionary Concepts in Ancient Greece
bust of Epicurus " Ancient Greece " is a very loose term that refers to the Greek speaking cultures from the period of about 800 BCE to 200 CE , a period of about 1000 years .
The exact times and cultures considered to be a part of " ancient Greece " vary from historian to historian .
The cultures , philosophies , and beliefs of " ancient Greece " are , of course , extremely varied .
There is no possible way to generalize " ancient Greek " culture , and the individuals within each of the different cultures were themselves highly varied .
The first logically proposed evolutionary concept is agreed to have come from Anaximandros ( Anaximander ) of Miletos , who lived from 610 BCE to 547 BCE , about 100 years before the writing of Genesis .
Very few texts from Anaximander remain today , but some information about the teachings of Anaximander have been preserved by later writers who disagreed with him .
Anaximander believed that life must have started in the water , and that from this early form of life , other forms of life , including man , developed .
Below are some quotes that refer to the evolutionary concepts of Anaximander :
Wherefore they ( the Syrians ) reference the fish as of the same origin and the same family as man , holding a more reasonable philosophy than that of Anaximandros ; for he declares , not that fishes and men were generated at the same time , but that at first men were generated in the form of fishes , and that growing up as sharks do till they were able to help themselves , they then came forth on the dry ground .
- Plutarch ( 1st century CE ) Anaximandros , the companion of Thales , says that the infinite is the sole cause of all generation and destruction , and from it the heavens were separated , and similarly all the worlds , which are infinite in number .
And he declared that destruction and , far earlier , generation have taken place since an indefinite time , since all things are involved in a cycle .
He says that the earth is a cylinder in form , and that its depth is one - third of its breadth .
And he says that at the beginning of this world something [ Diels ] productive of heat and cold from the eternal being was separated therefrom , and a sort of sphere of this flame surrounded the air about the earth , as bark surrounds a tree ; then this sphere was broken into parts and defined into distinct circles , and thus arose the sun and the moon and the stars .
Farther he says that at the beginning man was generated from all sorts of animals , since all the rest can quickly get food for themselves , but man alone requires careful feeding for a long time ; such a being at the beginning could not have preserved his existence .
Such is the teaching of Anaximandros .
- Hippolytus ( 3rd century CE )
Animals come into being through vapors raised by the sun .
Man , however , came into being from another animal , namely the fish , for at first he was like a fish .
Winds are due to a separation of the lightest vapors and the motion of the masses of these vapors ; and moisture comes from the vapor raised by the sun from them ; and lightning occurs when a wind falls upon clouds and separates them .
Anaximandros was born in the third year of the forty - second Olympiad .
- Hippolytus ( 3rd century CE )
What distinguishes the teachings of Anaximander from other origin mythology is that his views were arrived at from a naturalistic perspective and they were not tied to any religious belief .
Anaximander is credited with having invented the sun dial and other observational instruments .
He produced teachings in the fields of mathematics , astronomy , geography , and biology .
While his teachings were crude compared to what we know today , they represent the earliest known example of naturalistic evolutionary thought .
Xenophanes of Kolopbon , who was born around 570 BCE , was both the first recorded person to have understood the implications of fossils , and also one of the first monotheists .
Xenophanes was considered an " atheist " of his time because he rejected the traditional Greek pantheon of anthropomorphic gods , instead claiming that there was only one god and that god was infinite .
Despite the fact that this view seems " religious " today , Xenophanes was seen as a rationalist and materialist of his time .
Like other monotheistic Greeks , Xenophanes did not develop any kind of religion or base his beliefs on claims of divine revelation .
Instead , his view of god was philosophically derived .
In relation to fossils , Xenophanes understood that the fossils were formed by animals that had been preserved in mud .
He developed an explanation for fossils which stated that earth must have gone through many life cycles , during which different forms of animals existed and were then wiped out , but their bodies were preserved in the rocks .
He believed that new forms of animals developed during the new cycles .
Xenophanes did not believe that his god created people , instead he stated that all living things , including people , developed from earth and water .
" Shells are found inland and in the mountains , and in the quarries of Syracuse an impression of a fish and seaweed has been found , and impressions of fish were found in Paros in the depth of the rock and in Malta impressions of many marine creatures .
These , he [ Xenophanes ] says , were produced when everything was long ago covered with mud and the impressions were dried in the mud . "
- Hippolytus ( discussing the teachings of Xenophanes ) The Greeks , along with other ancient cultures , came into frequent contact with fossils .
The word fossil actually comes from Greek and means " dug - up item " .
The Greeks did not use the term fossil the way that we do today , instead they often talked of petrified bones when discussing larger fossils .
Ample evidence now suggests that the fantastic mythology of the ancient Greeks was heavily influenced by their observation of fossils .
Not only were fossils commonly found out in the open throughout the lands of ancient Greece , but the Greeks quarried massive amounts of rock .
In the process of quarrying rock they often came across fossils .
Fossils were actually excavated and put on display in temples in some cases .
The Greeks interpreted many of the large bones that they found as being humanoid .
When the Greeks found large thigh bones , for example , they were commonly interpreted as the bones of giants , and it is from these giant bones that the Greeks developed the mythology that Titians once lived on earth , whom Zeus and the other gods fought and killed .
Because of the tendency of the Greeks to interpret the " bodily " fossils that they found as humanoid , when they found near complete skeletons that included horned or tusked skulls they interpreted these as having a human type body with an animal head .
A small sampling of ancient accounts of fossils are listed below : " I have seen shells on the hills , " evidence that " Egypt was originally an arm of the sea . "
In Scythia , " the natives show a footprint left by Heracles on a rock by the river Tyras .
It is like a man 's footprint , but 3 feet long . " ( units of measure translated )
- The Histories ; Herodotus , 430 BCE " When King Masinissa landed on the headland of Malta , his admiral stole the special tusks of astonishing size from the ancient Temple of Juno . "
- Against Verres ; Cicero ( born 106 BCE ) A " figure resembling Pan " was found inside a slab of rock split open in a Chios quarry .
- De Divinatione ; Cicero " earth brought forth the giants , ... who were matchless in the bulk of their bodies and invincible in their might , with terrible aspect ....
Some say they were born at Phlegra [ Italy ] , but according to others in Phallene [ Greece ] . "
Zeuse " killed them with thunderbolts and Heracles shot them with arrows . "
Athena " threw Sicily on top of the giant Enceladus , " while Poseidon " broke off part of Kos and heaped it on the giant Polybotes . "
Typhon " surpassed all the offspring of earth .
As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of prodigious bulk . "
Zeus fought him from Syria to Thrace and finally buried Typhon under Mount Etna , Sicily .
- Apollodorus ( 1st century CE )
" The giants [ were ] men of immense bodies , whose bones of enormous size are still shown in certain places for confirmation of their existence . "
- Clement of Rome , 96 CE " Historians of Chios assert that near Mount Pelinaeus in a wooded glen there was a dragon of gigantic size who made the Chians shudder .
No farmer or shepherd dared approach the monster 's lair .
But a miraculous event allowed the discovery of how large it really was .
During a violent lightning storm a forest fire destroyed the entire region of the wooded slopes ....
After the fire , all the Chians came to see and discovered the bones of gigantic size and a terrifying skull .
From these the villagers were able to imagine how large and terrible the brute was when alive .
... Euphorion says ... that in primeval times Samos was uninhabited [ except for ] animals of gigantic size , which were savage and dangerous , called Neades .
Now these animals with there mere roaring split the ground .
So there is a proverbial saying in Samos : ' So and so roars louder than the Neades . '
And Euphorion asserts that their huge remains are displayed even to this day . "
- On Animals ; Aelian ( lived 170-230 CE )
Two schools of thought developed to explain these " large bones " : Mythological explanations and naturalistic explanations .
To some degree , however , even the mythological explanations were naturalistic , because these were not mythologies that were made up out of thin air , nor did the mythological beliefs of Greeks always include supernatural beliefs .
To many Greeks the objects of their mythology were as real and natural to them as dinosaurs are to us today .
Despite this , not all Greeks believed in the mythological explanations for the bones , as we shall see , but before discussing the naturalistic Greek explanations for fossils we must first discuss the Greek atomic theory and evolutionary concepts about the " origins of worlds " .
Between 500 and 370 BCE Anaxagoras , Leucippus , and Democritus are credited with developing the basis of materialism ( the view that everything that exists is made of matter ) and the concept of the atom .
Democritus is specifically credited with developing the first atomic concept .
Democritus identified atoms as the smallest forms of matter , of which everything else is made .
The early atomic concepts were based on the observation that things could be transformed .
Specifically , animals were observed to consume food in the form of grass as they grew in size .
The conclusion was that the grass had to be made of invisibly small particles that were capable of being broken apart and then put back together into different forms .
The early atomists had made the connection that living bodies were actually composed of the material that they ate .
The Greek concepts of atoms were relatively crude compared to today , but the fundamental concept of the atom as a particle was the foundation for the materialist understanding of reality .
Democritus stated : " The universe is infinite because it has not been produced by a creator .
The causes of what now exists had no beginning . "
" There is an infinite number of worlds of different sizes : some are larger than ours , some have no sun or moon , others have suns or moons that are bigger than ours .
Some have many suns and moons .
Worlds are spaced at differing distances from each other ; in some parts of the universe there are more worlds , in other parts fewer .
In some areas they are growing , in other parts , decreasing .
They are destroyed by collision with one another .
There are some worlds with no living creatures , plants , or moisture . "
" The material cause of all things that exist is the coming together of atoms and void .
Atoms are too small to be perceived by the senses .
They are eternal and have many different shapes , and they can cluster together to create things that are perceivable .
Differences in shape , arrangement , and position of atoms produce different things .
By aggregation they provide bulky objects that we can perceive with our sight and other senses . "
" By convention sweet , by convention bitter , by convention hot , by convention cold , by convention colour : but in reality atoms and void . "
- Democritus Atomism was never completely accepted among all the Greeks , in part because of the materialism that the concept was based on , and because the atomists proposed that the world was created from the chance collisions of atoms , contradicting the popular idea of a purposeful creation .
Plato and Aristotle , in particular , argued against the atomic concepts of the materialists .
Democritus ' atomic concepts were integrated into the later teachings of Epicurus .
The Epicurean school of thought went on to become relatively well accepted in Greece .
It 's estimated that about 30 % of Athenians were Epicureans during the philosophy 's height .
Like so many of the other naturalistic works of the Greeks , almost all the texts of the atomists were lost or destroyed by the Christians .
Cicero's The Nature of the Gods does , however , provide a good summary of the Epicurean concept of the " evolution " of worlds from the random collisions of atoms .
[ T ] he world was produced by the working of nature , without there having been any need for a process of manufacture , and that what your school declares to be capable of accomplishment only by means of divine intelligence is a thing so easy that nature will produce , and is producing , and has produced worlds without end .
It is because you do not see how nature can accomplish this without the help of some kind of mind that , like the tragic poets , in your inability to bring the plot to a smooth conclusion , you have recourse to a god .
Yet you would certainly feel no need for his agency if you had before your eyes the expanse of region , unmeasured and on every side unbounded , upon which the mind may fasten and concentrate itself , and where it may wander far and wide without seeing any farthermost limit upon which to be able to rest .
Now in this immensity of length and breadth and height there floats an infinite quantity of innumerable atoms which , in spite of the intervening void , nevertheless join together , and through one seizing upon one , and another upon another , form themselves into connected wholes , by which means are produced those forms and outlines of the material world which your school is of opinion cannot be produced without bellows and anvils .
You have therefore placed our necks beneath the yoke of a perpetual tyrant , of whom we are to go in fear by day and night , for who would not fear a god who foresaw everything , considered everything , noted everything , and looked upon himself as concerned in everything , —a busy and prying god ?
From this has come , in the first place , your idea of preordained necessity , which you call ε μαρμένη , meaning by the term that every event that occurs had its origin in eternal truth and the chain of causation — ( though what is to be thought of a philosophy that holds the ignorant old crone ’s belief that everything happens by destiny ? ) — and secondly your art of μαντικ , or divinatio , as it is called in Latin , which , if we were willing to listen to you , would imbue us with such superstition that we should have to pay regard to soothsayers , augurs , diviners , prophets , and interpreters of dreams .
From these terrors we have been released by Epicurus , and claimed for freedom ; we do not fear beings of whom we understand that they neither create trouble for themselves , nor seek it for others , and we worship , in piety and holiness , a sublime and exalted nature .
- The Nature of the Gods ; Cicero , 45 BCE
To these concepts the Stoic of the dialog , after giving many examples of " ordered phenomena " , replies : Can any sane person think that all this grouping of the stars , and this vast ordering of the heavens , could have resulted from atoms coursing to and fro fortuitously and at random ?
Or could , indeed , any kind of nature that was destitute of mind and intelligence have produced these results , which not only needed intelligence in order to be produced , but which cannot be understood in their nature without a very considerable amount of intelligence ?
- The Nature of the Gods ; Cicero , 45 BCE
It was this concept of atoms and infinity that freed the Greek Epicureans and materialists to embrace evolutionary concepts of life origin .
Though Cicero does not present the Epicurean teachings on biological evolution in The Nature , the Greek materialists had nevertheless developed a highly sophisticated concept of evolution with natural selection .
Atomic theory was the essential first step in their development of concepts of biological evolution .
Several different Greeks are known to have put forward varying evolutionary explanations for biological diversity , ranging from the mythical to the purely naturalistic .
Two of the best surviving examples of Greek evolutionary concepts come from the Epicurean Lucretius and from Aristotle , who argued against the concept .
In 50 BCE the Roman philosopher Lucretius wrote the epic poem On the Nature of Things , which is now one of the best surviving examples of Greek materialist thought in a materialist 's own words .
( Most of our knowledge of Greek materialism comes from the remaining writings that opposed the view )
This work contains the best known explanation of the Greek concept of biological evolution written by a proponent of the teaching .
In a section titled " Origins of Vegetable and Animal Life " Lucretius wrote :
For lapsing aeons change the nature of
The whole wide world , and all things needs must take
One status after other , nor aught persists
Forever like itself .
All things depart ;
Nature she changeth all , compelleth all
To transformation .
...
In suchwise , then , the lapsing aeons change
The nature of the whole wide world , and earth
Taketh one status after other .
And what
She bore of old , she now can bear no longer ,
And what she never bore , she can to - day .
In those days also the telluric world
Strove to beget the monsters that upsprung
With their astounding visages and limbs -
The Man -woman - a thing betwixt the twain ,
Yet neither , and from either sex remote -
Some gruesome Boggles orphaned of the feet ,
Some widowed of the hands , dumb Horrors too
Without a mouth , or blind Ones of no eye ,
Or Bulks all shackled by their legs and arms
Cleaving unto the body fore and aft ,
Thuswise , that never could they do or go ,
Nor shun disaster , nor take the good they would .
And other prodigies and monsters earth
Was then begetting of this sort - in vain ,
Since Nature banned with horror their increase ,
And powerless were they to reach unto
The coveted flower of fair maturity ,
Or to find aliment , or to intertwine
In works of Venus .
For we see there must
Concur in life conditions manifold ,
If life is ever by begetting life
To forge the generations one by one :
First , foods must be ; and , next , a path whereby
The seeds of impregnation in the frame
May ooze , released from the members all ;
Last , the possession of those instruments
Whereby the male with female can unite ,
The one with other in mutual ravishments .
And in the ages after monsters died ,
Perforce there perished many a stock , unable
By propagation to forge a progeny .
For whatsoever creatures thou beholdest
Breathing the breath of life , the same have been
Even from their earliest age preserved alive
By cunning , or by valour , or at least
By speed of foot or wing .
And many a stock
Remaineth yet , because of use to man ,
And so committed to man 's guardianship .
Valour hath saved alive fierce lion - breeds
And many another terrorizing race ,
Cunning the foxes , flight the antlered stags .
Light - sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast ,
However , and every kind begot from seed
Of beasts of draft , as , too , the woolly flocks
And horned cattle , all , my Memmius ,
Have been committed to guardianship of men .
For anxiously they fled the savage beasts ,
And peace they sought and their abundant foods ,
Obtained with never labours of their own ,
Which we secure to them as fit rewards
For their good service .
But those beasts to whom
Nature has granted naught of these same things -
Beasts quite unfit by own free will to thrive
And vain for any service unto us
In thanks for which we should permit their kind
To feed and be in our protection safe -
Those , of a truth , were wont to be exposed ,
Enshackled in the gruesome bonds of doom ,
As prey and booty for the rest , until
Nature reduced that stock to utter death .
But Centaurs ne'er have been , nor can there be
Creatures of twofold stock and double frame ,
Compact of members alien in kind ,
Yet formed with equal function , equal force
In every bodily part - a fact thou mayst ,
However dull thy wits , well learn from this :
...
Such hybrid creatures could not have been begot
And limbs of all beasts heterogeneous
Have been together knit ; because , indeed ,
The divers kinds of grasses and the grains
And the delightsome trees - which even now
Spring up abounding from within the earth -
Can still ne'er be begotten with their stems
Begrafted into one ; but each sole thing
Proceeds according to its proper wont
And all conserve their own distinctions based
In Nature 's fixed decree .
- On the Nature of Things ; Lucretius , 50 BCE
The monsters that Lucretius mentions no doubt refer to the many forms found in fossils , but the discussion of monsters also contains the idea that many of the early forms of life were " unfit " , and that through a process of " natural selection " , which he discusses , the forms of life that were able to survive did survive and have passed on their traits to their present day descendants .
It is also important to note that Lucretius denied the existence of " fantastical " creatures , such as centaurs , griffins , etc .
As much as this sounds similar to our present day concept of evolution it must be remember that Lucretius ' work is but a poem , and though poems were often used in ancient times , it was still not as rigorous a text as other scholarly works .
We do know , however , that an even more sophisticated concept of evolution existed hundreds of years before Lucretius because of Aristotle 's discussion of the concept in 350 BCE .
Aristotle refuted the idea of evolution , however , but mentioned the concept in his work because he taught against it .
He taught against it because it was a known concept that had been embraced by a significant portion of thinkers at the time .
We must explain then ( 1 ) that Nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something ; ... [ I ] f a man 's crop is spoiled on the threshing - floor , the rain did not fall for the sake of this - in order that the crop might be spoiled - but that result just followed .
Why then should it not be the same with the parts in nature , e.g. that our teeth should come up of necessity - the front teeth sharp , fitted for tearing , the molars broad and useful for grinding down the food - since they did not arise for this end , but it was merely a coincident result ; and so with all other parts in which we suppose that there is purpose ?
Wherever then all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come before an end , such things survived , being organized spontaneously in a fitting way ; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish ....
Such are the arguments ( and others of the kind ) which may cause difficulty on this point .
Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view .
For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or normally come about in a given way ; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true .
We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter , but frequent rain in summer we do ; nor heat in the dog - days , but only if we have it in winter .
If then , it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end , and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity , it follows that they must be for an end ; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree .
Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature .
- Physics ; Aristotle , 350 BCE
This description of the process of evolution and natural selection put forward by Aristotle is perhaps the most lucid explanation of evolution to be found in the existing literature of the ancient Greeks .
Why is it that the best explanation of evolution comes to us in a book that is written by an author that is opposed to the concept of evolution ?
The Early Christian Fight Against Naturalism Understanding Christian belief requires understanding the historical development of those beliefs , and understanding the Christian impact on the world also requires understanding the historical rise of Christianity .
" Christianity " is an amalgam of Jewish mythology and law , Zoroastrian mythology and theology , Ptolemaic Egyptian Religion , Greek philosophy , Roman civics , and Roman imperialism .
The Christian religion as we know it today developed over a period of several hundred years .
The concept of God in Christianity is not the Jewish concept of God .
The God of the Hebrews was a God that embodied both good and bad .
He was the creator of both strife and blessing .
The Christian concept of God , on the other hand , is a combination of the Platonic god concept and the Zoroastrian God. Isaiah 45 :
7 The One forming light and creating darkness , Causing well - being and creating calamity ; I am the LORD who does all these .
- The Torah / Old Testament Furthermore , the god of the Hebrews was not well defined , he was simply YAHWEH , who gave various commands and was given credit for the fortunes or misfortunes of the Hebrew people .
Likewise , the Jews did not have a concept of Satan like that which exists in Christianity .
The Hebrew religion presents Satan as one of God 's helpers - a being that tests the faith of individuals for God .
In the Hebrew religion there is no " war in heaven " or " fall from grace " .
The Christian concept of Satan comes from Zoroastrianism .
Early Christianity adopted Zoroastrian mythology and the concepts of Zoroastrian dualism .
The word devil does not appear in the Torah or the Old Testament because the word " devil " comes from the Persian word daeva , which was used by Zoroastrians to describe evil spirits .
The Zoroastrian religion believed in one god , Ahura Mazda , who was completely good .
In opposition to Ahura Mazda was Angra Mainyu , the evil one .
Pre-Christian image of Angra Mainyu According to Zoroastrian mythology these two beings were almost equally powerful and they were locked in a cosmic battle of good vs. evil .
Angra Mainyu , according to the mythology , rebelled against Ahura Mazda and is responsible for all of the ills of the world , while Ahura Mazda is responsible for all of the good things .
On the day of final judgment Zoroastrians believe that Ahura Mazda will defeat Angra Mainyu and banish him , as well as all evil , from the universe forever .
It is a matter of historical fact that this mythology of the Zoroastrians existed before the advent of the Christian religion , and the transmission of this mythology to Jews within the Babylonian empire is also a matter of recorded history .
This dualism set the stage for the integration of the Platonic concept of god .
Early Christianity developed among Greek speaking and Aramaic speaking Jews .
The word Christ itself is Greek and means " anointed one " .
The first references to " Christianity " began to emerge around 120 CE in Greek speaking regions around the Mediterranean Sea .
Paul , the apostle who is said to have spread the message of Christianity , spent his time promoting the religion in Greece .
Acts 17:18 -33 ( New International Version ) 18A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him .
Some of them asked , " What is this babbler trying to say ? "
Others remarked , " He seems to be advocating foreign gods . "
They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection .
19 Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus , where they said to him , " May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting ?
20 You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears , and we want to know what they mean . "
21 ( All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas . )
22 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said : " Men of Athens !
I see that in every way you are very religious .
23 For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship , I even found an altar with this inscription : TO AN UNKNOWN GOD .
Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you .
24 " The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands .
25
And he is not served by human hands , as if he needed anything , because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else .
26 From one man he made every nation of men , that they should inhabit the whole earth ; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live .
27 God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
28 ' For in him we live and move and have our being . '
As some of your own poets have said , ' We are his offspring . '
29 " Therefore since we are God 's offspring , we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone — an image made by man 's design and skill .
30
In the past God overlooked such ignorance , but now he commands all people everywhere to repent .
31 For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed .
He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead . "
32 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead , some of them sneered , but others said , " We want to hear you again on this subject . "
33 At that , Paul left the Council .
It was the Epicureans who would have sneered no doubt .
The fact of the matter is , however , that the concept of a single god , creator of the universe , had been log established in Greece on philosophical grounds .
As early Christianity developed in Greece it was heavily influenced by the Greek concepts of god and providence .
Clement of Alexandria , who was born in Athens around 150 CE , was a highly influential early Christian theologian .
Clement was a Greek and infused Christianity with a strong element of Platonic philosophy .
Clement 's attacks on other Greek philosophies is indicative of the interactions between Christianity and Greek philosophy of his time .
The following quotes are taken from Clement 's Stromata , written in 190 CE .
" Theopompus and Timaeus , who composed fables and slanders , and Epicurus the leader of atheism , and Hipponax and Archilochus , are to be allowed to write in their own shameful manner .
But he who proclaims the truth is to be prevented from leaving behind him what is to benefit posterity ?
It is a good thing , I reckon , to leave to posterity good children .
This is the case with children of our bodies .
But words are the progeny of the soul . "
- The Stromata , Book I ; Clement of Alexandria , 190 CE Here Clement is discussing the issue of whether or not Christians should leave behind writings or reject writings as materialistic and embrace oral tradition instead .
Clement was a well educated Greek from a well off background , and thus he believed that Christians should embrace philosophy and literature , things that earlier Christians had opposed .
" The Greek preparatory culture , therefore , with philosophy itself , is shown to have come down from God to men , ... ...
These arts , therefore , if not conjoined with philosophy , will be injurious to every one .
For Plato openly called sophistry " an evil art . "
And Aristotle , following him , demonstrates it to be a dishonest art , which abstracts in a specious manner the whole business of wisdom , and professes a wisdom which it has not studied .
...
Thus the truth - loving Plato says , as if divinely inspired , " Since I am such as to obey nothing but the word , which , after reflection , appears to me the best . "
Accordingly he charges those who credit opinions without intelligence and knowledge , with abandoning right and sound reason unwarrantably , and believing him who is a partner in falsehood .
For to cheat one 's self of the truth is bad ; but to speak the truth , and to hold as our opinions positive realities , is good .
...
CHAPTER XI -- WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY WHICH THE APOSTLE BIDS US SHUN ?
This , then , " the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God , " and of those who are " the wise the Lord knoweth their thoughts that they are vain . "
Let no man therefore glory on account of pre-eminence in human thought .
For it is written well in Jeremiah , " Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , and let not the mighty man glory in his might , and let not the rich man glory in his riches : but let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth that I am the Lord , that executeth mercy and judgment and righteousness upon the earth : for in these things is my delight , saith the Lord . "
" That we should trust not in ourselves , but in God who raiseth the dead , " says the apostle , " who delivered us from so great a death , that our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God . "
" For the spiritual man judgeth all things , but he himself is judged of no man . "
I hear also those words of his , " And these things I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words , or one should enter in to spoil you . "
And again , " Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ ; " branding not all philosophy , but the Epicurean , which Paul mentions in the Acts of the Apostles , which abolishes providence and deifies pleasure , and whatever other philosophy honours the elements , but places not over them the efficient cause , nor apprehends the Creator . "
- The Stromata , Book I ; Clement of Alexandria , 190 CE
What would become known as the Christian movement began among the poor and uneducated , which is a major reason why there are no writings from the earliest " Christians " .
It is within the Greek culture , and through the Greek influence , that Christianity gained the intellectual fortitude , as well as the credibility , to expand beyond the simple moralistic movement of its origin .
The god of Christianity was heavily influenced by the god of Plato and Aristotle .
The god of Plato and Aristotle is the all knowing and all powerful creator of the universe and instrument of " final causes " .
The god of Plato and Aristotle was a philosophically derived concept though , and not to be worshiped - nor did their god love and care .
The Zoroastrian god of love and forgiveness was merged with the Platonic god of omnipotence and infinity to create the all knowing , all powerful , and all loving god of Christianity .
Plato , who lived between 427 and 327 BCE , believed in the immortality of the soul and in the existence of two forms of reality , the corrupt material world that we experience while we are alive on earth and another perfect spiritual world where the soul goes after death .
Plato thought that truth came from the soul , while falsehood came from the natural world .
Aristotle , while more of a naturalist than Plato , accepted Plato 's view of god and added that whatever has a use must be the product of an intelligent creator , thus all things in nature that have a function must have been created by god .
Aristotle extended the teleology of Socrates into a system of natural philosophy that he used to describe all of the phenomena of nature , especially the phenomena of life .
Teleology is a doctrine that attempts to explain the universe in terms of ends or " final causes " .
Teleology is based on the proposition that the universe has design and purpose .
In Aristotelian philosophy the explanation of , or justification for , a phenomenon or process is to be found not only in the immediate cause , but also in the " final cause " — the reason for which the phenomenon exists or was created .
" Further , where a series has a completion , all the preceding steps are for the sake of that .
Now surely as in intelligent action , so in nature ; and as in nature , so it is in each action , if nothing interferes .
Now intelligent action is for the sake of an end ; therefore the nature of things also is so .
Thus if a house , e.g. had been a thing made by nature , it would have been made in the same way as it is now by art ; and if things made by nature were made also by art , they would come to be in the same way as by nature .
Each step then in the series is for the sake of the next ; and generally art partly completes what nature cannot bring to a finish , and partly imitates her .
If , therefore , artificial products are for the sake of an end , so clearly also are natural products .
The relation of the later to the earlier terms of the series is the same in both .
This is most obvious in the animals other than man : they make things neither by art nor after inquiry or deliberation .
Wherefore people discuss whether it is by intelligence or by some other faculty that these creatures work , spiders , ants , and the like .
By gradual advance in this direction we come to see clearly that in plants too that is produced which is conducive to the end - leaves , e.g. grow to provide shade for the fruit .
If then it is both by nature and for an end that the swallow makes its nest and the spider its web , and plants grow leaves for the sake of the fruit and send their roots down ( not up ) for the sake of nourishment , it is plain that this kind of cause is operative in things which come to be and are by nature .
And since ' nature ' means two things , the matter and the form , of which the latter is the end , and since all the rest is for the sake of the end , the form must be the cause in the sense of ' that for the sake of which ' .
...
It is plain then that nature is a cause , a cause that operates for a purpose . "
- Physics ; Aristotle , 350 BCE
So , what does all of this have to do with evolution ?
Opposition to the ancient Greek concept of evolution was an integral part of the early development of Christianity .
The philosophy and culture of Christianity has its roots among the anti-Epicurean philosophers of Greece .
Anti-Epicurean philosophy of Greece was merged with Christianity by early Greek theologians , whose works became the basis for later Christian theology .
Both directly and indirectly , Christian theology was heavily influenced by Platonic philosophy from this early point on .
This is not to say that Christian theologians accepted every philosophical principle of Plato , they did not , but Platonic views had become such an integrated part of some segments of Greek and Jewish society by the time Christianity came along that many Platonic views had ceased to be strictly identified with Plato and were just popularly held concepts that evolved and integrated into various other philosophical and religious systems .
Plato was embraced by early Christians , but even he was rejected as time went on and Christian ideology become increasingly anti-philosophical and opposed to all people who were associated with " the pagan times " .
Concepts adopted by Christians from Platonic Greek philosophers include : God is infinite and perfect
The ontological argument for the existence of god
Logos ( logos has dual meanings : logic and word ) is the source of existence
Logos ( logic ) is unique to humans
The soul contains sacred knowledge that people have from birth
The sun revolves around the earth
Nature is a product of intelligent design , and god is the designer Most important , however , was the conflict between the early Christians and the other schools of philosophy , namely the Epicureans .
The early Christians saw Epicureanism and other forms of natural philosophy as the main ideologies that they were struggling against .
The writings of the early Christian fathers are littered with references to Epicureanism , Anaxagoras , and Democritus .
Likewise , the naturalistic philosophers saw Christianity as a growing negative influence in the civilized world as well .
One of the most striking books written by the early Christians is perhaps Refutation of All Heresies by Hippolytus of Rome .
It is not known when Hippolytus was born , but he is thought to have died around 235 CE .
What makes Refutation of All Heresies so extraordinary is that it is a collection and explanation of all of the most well known naturalistic philosophies of the time , which the work then goes on to refute .
The work stated to Christians that the ideas held by the naturalistic philosophers were heretical .
Refutation of All Heresies now provides one of the fullest explanations of the Greek philosophies because it is one of the fullest accounts that remains of these teachings ( the originals were destroyed by the Christians ) .
" We propose to furnish an account of the tenets of natural philosophers , and who these are , as well as the tenets of moral philosophers , and who these are ; and thirdly , the tenets of logicians , and who these logicians are .
Among natural philosophers may be enumerated Thales , Pythagoras , Empedocles , Heraclitus , Anaximander , Anaximenes , Anaxagoras , Archelaus , Parmenides , Leucippus , Democritus , Xenophanes , Ecphantus , Hippo .
Among moral philosophers are Socrates , pupil of Archelaus the physicist , ( and ) Plato the pupil of Socrates .
This ( speculator ) combined three systems of philosophy .
Among logicians is Aristotle , pupil of Plato .
He systematized the art of dialectics .
Among the Stoic ( logicians ) were Chrysippus ( and ) Zeno .
Epicurus , however , advanced an opinion almost contrary to all philosophers .
Pyrrho was an Academic ; this ( speculator ) taught the in-comprehensibility of everything .
The Brahmins among the Indians , and the Druids among the Celts , and Hesiod ( devoted themselves to philosophic pursuits ) .
... CHAP .
I.-- THALES ; HIS PHYSICS AND THEOLOGY ; FOUNDER OF GREEK ASTRONOMY .
It is said that Thales of Miletus , one of the seven , wise men , first attempted to frame a system of natural philosophy .
This person said that some such thing as water is the generative principle of the universe , and its end ;-- for that out of this , solidified and again dissolved , all things consist , and that all things are supported on it ; from which also arise both earthquakes and changes of the winds and atmospheric movements , and that all things are both produced and are in a state of flux corresponding with the nature of the primary author of generation ; ... CHAP .
V.--ANAXIMANDER ; HIS THEORY OF THE INFINITE ; HIS ASTRONOMIC OPINIONS ; HIS PHYSICS .
Anaximander , then , was the hearer of Thales .
Anaximander was son of Praxiadas , and a native of Miletus .
This man said that the originating principle of existing things is a certain constitution of the Infinite , out of which the heavens are generated , and the worlds therein ; and that this principle is eternal and undecaying , and comprising all the worlds .
And he speaks of time as something of limited generation , and subsistence , and destruction .
This person declared the Infinite to be an originating principle and element of existing things , being the first to employ such a denomination of the originating principle .
But , moreover , he asserted that there is an eternal motion , by the agency of which it happens that the heavens are generated ; but that the earth is poised aloft , upheld by nothing , continuing on account of its equal distance from all ( the heavenly bodies ) ; ...
And that man was , originally , similar to a different animal , that is , a fish .
And that winds are caused by the separation of very rarified exhalations of the atmosphere , and by their motion after they have been condensed .
And that rain arises from earth 's giving back ( the vapours which it receives ) from the ( clouds under the sun .
And that there are flashes of lightning when the wind coming down severs the clouds .
CHAP .
VII .-- ANAXAGORAS ; HIS THEORY OF MIND ; RECOGNISES AN EFFICIENT CAUSE ; HIS COSMOGONY AND ASTRONOMY .
...
And that animals originally came into existence in moisture , and after this one from another ; and that males are procreated when the seed secreted from the right parts adhered to the right parts of the womb , and that females are born when the contrary took place .
CHAP .
VIII .-- ARCHELAUS ; SYSTEM AKIN TO THAT OF ANAXAGORAS ; HIS ORIGIN OF THE EARTH AND OF ANIMALS ; OTHER SYSTEMS .
...
And with regard to animals , he affirms that the earth , being originally fire in its lower part , where the heat and cold were intermingled , both the rest of animals made their appearance , numerous and dissimilar , all having the same food , being nourished from mud ; and their existence was of short duration , but afterwards also generation from one another arose unto them ; and men were separated from the rest ( of the animal creation ) , and they appointed rulers , and laws , and arts , and cities , and the rest .
And he asserts that mind is innate in all animals alike ; for that each , according to the difference of their physical constitution , employed ( mind ) , at one time slower , at another faster .
... CHAP .
X.-- LEUCIPPUS ; HIS ATOMIC THEORY .
But Leucippus , an associate of Zeno , did not maintain the same opinion , but affirms things to be infinite , and always in motion , and that generation and change exist continuously .
And he affirms plenitude and vacuum to be elements .
And he asserts that worlds are produced when many bodies are congregated and flow together from the surrounding space to a common point , so that by mutual contact they made substances of the same figure and similar in form come into connection ; and when thus intertwined , there are transmutations into other bodies , and that created things wax and wane through necessity .
But what the nature of necessity is , ( Parmenides ) did not define .
... CHAP .
XI .-- DEMOCRITUS ; HIS DUALITY OF PRINCIPLES ; HIS COSMOGONY .
And Democritus was an acquaintance of Leucippus .
Democritus , son of Damasippus , a native of Abdera , conferring with many gymnosophists among the Indians , and with priests in Egypt , and with astrologers and magi in Babylon , ( propounded his system ) .
Now he makes statements similarly with Leucippus concerning elements , viz .
plenitude and vacuum , denominating plenitude entity , and vacuum nonentity ; and this he asserted , since existing things are continually moved in the vacuum .
And he maintained worlds to be infinite , and varying in bulk ; and that in some there is neither sun nor moon , while in others that they are larger than with us , and with others more numerous .
And that intervals between worlds are unequal ; and that in one quarter of space ( worlds ) are more numerous , and in another less so ; and that some of them increase in bulk , but that others attain their full size , while others dwindle away and that in one quarter they are coming into existence , whilst in another they are failing ; and that they are destroyed by clashing one with another .
And that some worlds are destitute of animals and plants , and every species of moisture .
And that the earth of our world was created before that of the stars , and that the moon is underneath ; next ( to it ) the sun ; then the fixed stars .
And that ( neither ) the planets nor these ( fixed stars ) possess an equal elevation .
And that the world flourishes , until no longer it can receive anything from without .
This ( philosopher ) turned all things into ridicule , as if all the concerns of humanity were deserving of laughter .
... CHAP .
XIX .-- EPICURUS ; ADOPT'S THE DEMOCRITIC ATOMISM ; DENIAL OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE ; THE PRINCIPLE OF HIS ETHICAL SYSTEM .
Epicurus , however , advanced an opinion almost contrary to all .
He supposed , as originating principles of all things , atoms and vacuity .
He considered vacuity as the place that would contain the things that will exist , and atoms the matter out of which all things could be formed ; and that from the concourse of atoms both the Deity derived existence , and all the elements , and all things inherent in them , as well as animals and other ( creatures ) ; so that nothing was generated or existed , unless it be from atoms .
And he affirmed that these atoms were composed of extremely small particles , in which there could not exist either a point or a sign , or any division ; wherefore also he called them atoms .
... [ H ]e says that God has providential care for nothing , and that there is no such thing at all as providence or fate , but that all things are made by chance .
And he concluded that the souls of men are dissolved along with their bodies , just as also they were produced along with them , for that they are blood , and that when this has gone forth or been altered , the entire man perishes ; and in keeping with this tenet , ( Epicurus maintained ) that there are neither trials in Hades , nor tribunals of justice ; so that whatsoever any one may commit in this life , that , provided he may escape detection , he is altogether beyond any liability of trial ( for it in a future state ) .
...
The opinions , therefore , of those who have attempted to frame systems of philosophy among the Greeks , I consider that we have sufficiently explained ; and from these the heretics , taking occasion , have endeavoured to establish the tenets that will be after a short time declared .
It seems , however , expedient , that first explaining the mystical rites and whatever imaginary doctrines some have laboriously framed concerning the stars , or magnitudes , to declare these ; for heretics likewise , taking occasion from them , are considered by the multitude to utter prodigies .
Next in order we shall elucidate the feeble opinions advanced by these .
...
The followers , however , of Anaxagoras of Clazomenae , and of Democritus , and of Epicurus , and multitudes of others , have given it as their opinion that the generation of the universe proceeds from infinite numbers of atoms ; and we have previously made partial mention of these philosophers .
But Anaxagoras derives the universe from things similar to those that are being produced ; whereas the followers of Democritus and Epicurus derived the universe from things both dissimilar ( to the entities produced ) , and devoid of passion , that is , from atoms .
But the followers of Heraclides of Pontus , and of Asclepiades , derived the universe from things dissimilar ( to the entities produced ) , and capable of passion , as if from incongruous corpuscles .
But the disciples of Plato affirm that these entities are from three principles -- God , and Matter , and Exemplar .
He divides matter , however , into four principles -- fire , water , earth , and air .
And ( he says ) that God is the Creator of this ( matter ) , and that Mind is its exemplar .
... HAP .
XXVIII .-- THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRUTH .
The first and only ( one God ) , both Creator and Lord of all , had nothing coeval with Himself ; not infinite chaos , nor measureless water , nor solid earth , nor dense air , not warm fire , nor refined spirit , nor the azure canopy of the stupendous firmament .
But He was One , alone in Himself .
By an exercise of His will
He created things that are , which antecedently had no existence , except that He willed to make them .
For
He is fully acquainted with whatever is about to take place , for foreknowledge also is present to Him .
The different principles , however , of what will come into existence , He first fabricated , viz. , fire and spirit , water and earth , from which diverse elements
He proceeded to form
His own creation .
And some objects
He formed of one essence , but others
He compounded from two , and others from three , and others from four .
And those formed of one substance were immortal , for in their case dissolution does not follow , for what is one will never be dissolved .
Those , on the other hand , which are formed out of two , or three , or four substances , are dissoluble ; wherefore also are they named mortal .
For this has been denominated death ; namely , the dissolution of substances connected .
I now therefore think that I have sufficiently answered those endued with a sound mind , who , if they are desirous of additional instruction , and are disposed accurately to investigate the substances of these things , and the causes of the entire creation , will become acquainted with these points should they peruse a work of ours comprised ( under the title ) , Concerning the Substance of the Universe .
I consider , however , that at present it is enough to elucidate those causes of which the Greeks , not being aware , glorified , in pompous phraseology , the parts of creation , while they remained ignorant of the Creator .
And from these the heresiarchs have taken occasion , and have transformed the statements previously made by those Greeks into similar doctrines , and thus have framed ridiculous heresies .
...
Such is the true doctrine in regard of the divine nature , O ye men , Greeks and Barbarians , Chaldeans and Assyrians , Egyptians and Libyans , Indians and Ethiopians , Celts , and ye Latins , who lead armies , and all ye that inhabit Europe , and Asia , and Libya .
And to you I am become an adviser , inasmuch as I am a disciple of the benevolent Logos , and hence humane , in order that you may hasten and by us may be taught who the true God is , and what is His well - ordered creation .
Do not devote your attention to the fallacies of artificial discourses , nor the vain promises of plagiarizing heretics , but to the venerable simplicity of unassuming truth .
And by means of this knowledge you shall escape the approaching threat of the fire of judgment , and the rayless scenery of gloomy Tartarus , where never shines a beam from the irradiating voice of the Word !
You shall escape the boiling flood of hell 's eternal lake of fire and the eye ever fixed in menacing glare of fallen angels chained in Tartarus as punishment for their sins ; and you shall escape the worm that ceaselessly coils for food around the body whose scum has bred it .
Now such ( torments ) as these shall thou avoid by being instructed in a knowledge of the true God .
And thou shalt possess an immortal body , even one placed beyond the possibility of corruption , just like the soul .
And thou shalt receive the kingdom of heaven , thou who , whilst thou didst sojourn in this life , didst know the Celestial King .
And thou shalt be a companion of the Deity , and a co-heir with Christ , no longer enslaved by lusts or passions , and never again wasted by disease .
For thou hast become God : for whatever sufferings thou didst undergo while being a man , these
He gave to thee , because thou wast of mortal mould , but whatever it is consistent with God to impart , these God has promised to bestow upon thee , because thou hast been deified , and begotten unto immortality .
This constitutes the import of the proverb , " Know thyself ; " i.e. , discover God within thyself , for He has formed thee after His own image .
For with the knowledge of self is conjoined the being an object of God 's knowledge , for thou art called by the Deity Himself .
Be not therefore inflamed , O ye men , with enmity one towards another , nor hesitate to retrace with all speed your steps .
For Christ is the God above all , and He has arranged to wash away sin from human beings , rendering regenerate the old man .
And God called man
His likeness from the beginning , and has evinced in a figure His love towards thee .
And provided thou obeyest
His solemn injunctions , and becomest a faithful follower of Him who is good , thou shall resemble Him , inasmuch as thou shall have honour conferred upon thee by Him . "
- Refutation of All Heresies ; Hippolytus ( 3rd century CE )
This book is not only one the few remaining sources of information about the naturalistic philosophies of Greece that preceded Christianity , but it tells us the real story of the decline of Western Civilization .
All of the advanced knowledge and concepts of the ancient world were condemned by the Christians , considered heresies and eliminated .
The principles that we understand today as being products of " modern science " were generally understood over 2,000 years ago , but the Christians denied them and destroyed almost all evidence of these ideas , the only real evidence remaining being their own denunciations of the ideas .
The work of the Greeks and Romans was not purely " philosophical " as we know the term today .
The Greeks and Romans practiced science , thought they did not use the term .
They postulated hypothesis , conducted experiments , collected data , and reviewed each other 's work .
They conducted experiments on gravity that would not be duplicated again until the time of Galileo and Newton .
They built machines , calculating devices , mechanical robots , and observational instruments .
All of this was destroyed by the Christians .
The teachings of Epicurus were especially disdained and opposed by the Christians .
It was the Epicurean school that developed the most coherent philosophical framework of materialism that integrated the concepts of many of the different naturalistic philosophers and combined the ideas of atoms and evolution as well as natural explanations for fossils and meteorological events .
For the Epicureans all the world was explainable through observation and reason .
Epicurus himself is known to have been a very prolific writer , and he is thought to have written over 900 books , based on titles that have been referenced in other works , but Epicurus himself was just one of many men who held naturalistic views .
All of the early Christian theologians taught against Epicurus and naturalistic understandings of the world .
" And as he is in error who alleges that the superintendents of the markets make provision in no greater degree for men than for dogs , because dogs also get their share of the goods ; so in a far greater degree are Celsus and they who think with him guilty of impiety towards the God who makes provision for rational beings , in asserting that His arrangements are made in no greater degree for the sustenance of human beings than for that of plants , and trees , and herbs , and thorns .
For , in the first place , he is of opinion that ' thunders , and lightnings , and rains are not the works of God , '-- thus showing more clearly at last his Epicurean leanings ; and in the second place , that 'even if one were to grant that these were the works of God , they are brought into existence not more for the support of us who are human beings , than for that of plants , and trees , and herbs , and thorns , '-- maintaining , like a true Epicurean , that these things are the product of chance , and not the work of Providence .
For if these things are of no more use to us than to plants , and trees , and herbs , and thorns , it is evident either that they do not proceed from Providence at all , or from a providence which does not provide for us in a greater degree than for trees , and herbs , and thorns .
Now , either of these suppositions is impious in itself , and it would be foolish to refute such statements by answering any one who brought against us the charge of impiety ; for it is manifest to every one , from what has been said , who is the person guilty of impiety .
In the next place , he adds : ' Although you may say that these things , viz. , plants , and trees , and herbs , and thorns , grow for the use of men , why will you maintain that they grow for the use of men rather than for that of the most savage of irrational animals ? '
Let Celsus then say distinctly that the great diversity among the products of the earth is not the work of Providence , but that a certain fortuitous concurrence of atoms gave birth to qualities so diverse , and that it was owing to chance that so many kinds of plants , and trees , and herbs resemble one another , and that no disposing reason gave existence to them , and that they do not derive their origin from an understanding that is beyond all admiration .
We Christians , however , who are devoted to the worship of the only God , who created these things , feel grateful for them to Him who made them , because not only for us , but also ( on our account ) for the animals which are subject to us , He has prepared such a home , seeing ' He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man , that He may bring forth food out of the earth , and wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man 's heart . '
But that He should have provided food even for the most savage animals is not matter of surprise , for these very animals are said by some who have philosophized ( upon the subject ) to have been created for the purpose of affording exercise to the rational creature .
And one of our own wise men says somewhere : ' Do not say , What is this ?
or Wherefore is that ?
for all things have been made for their uses .
And do not say , What is this ?
or Wherefore is that ?
for everything shall be sought out in its season . ' "
- Contra Celsus , Book IV ; Origen of Alexandria ( 185-232 CE )
" But with reference to man , whom He formed an eternal and immortal being , He did not arm him , as the others , without , but within ; nor did He place his protection in the body , but in the soul : since it would have been superfluous , when He had given him that which was of the greatest value , to cover him with bodily defences , especially when they hindered the beauty of the human body .
On which account I am accustomed to wonder at the senselessness of the philosophers who follow Epicurus , who blame the works of nature , that they may show that the world is prepared and governed by no providence ; but they ascribe the origin of all things to indivisible and solid bodies , from the fortuitous meetings of which they say that all things are and were produced .
I pass by the things relating to the work itself with which they find fault , in which matter they are ridiculously mad ; I assume that which belongs to the subject of which we are now treating . "
- On the Workmanship of God ; Lucius Lactantius ( ~250-325 CE ) " " These , " [ Lucretius ] says , " flutter about with restless motions through empty space , and are carried hither and thither , just as we see little particles of dust in the sun when it has introduced its rays and light through a window .
From these there arise trees and herbs , and all fruits of the earth ; from these , animals , and water , and fire , and all things are produced , and are again resolved into the same elements . "
This can be borne as long as the inquiry is respecting small matters .
Even the world itself was made up of these .
He has reached to the full extent of perfect madness : it seems impossible that anything further should be said , and yet he found something to add .
" Since everything , " he says , " is infinite , and nothing can be empty , it follows of necessity that there are innumerable worlds . " ...
Why should I speak of animals , in whose bodies we see nothing formed without plan , without arrangement , without utility , without beauty , so that the most skilful and careful marking out of all the parts and members repels the idea of accident and chance ?
But let us suppose it possible that the limbs , and bones , and nerves , and blood should be made up of atoms .
What of the senses , the reflection , the memory , the mind , the natural capacity : from what seeds can they be compacted ?
He says , From the most minute .
There are therefore others of greater size .
How , then , are they indivisible ?
In the next place , if the things which are not seen are formed from invisible seeds , it follows that those which are seen are from visible seeds .
Why , then , does no one see them ?
But whether any one regards the invisible parts which are in man , or the parts which can be touched , and which are visible , who does not see that both parts exist in accordance with design ?
How , then , can bodies which meet together without design effect anything reasonable ?
For we see that there is nothing in the whole world which has not in itself very great and wonderful design .
And since this is above the sense and capacity of man , to what can it be more rightly attributed than to the divine providence ? "
- On the Anger of God ; Lucius Lactantius ( ~250-325 CE ) " Therefore , when Epicurus reflected on these things , induced as it were by the injustice of these matters ( for thus it appeared to him in his ignorance of the cause and subject ) , he thought that there was no providence .
And having persuaded himself of this , he undertook also to defend it , and thus he entangled himself in inextricable errors .
For if there is no providence , how is it that the world was made with such order and arrangement ?
He says :
There is no arrangement , for many things are made in a different manner from that in which they ought to have been made .
And the divine man found subjects of censure .
Now , if I had leisure to refute these things separately , I could easily show that this man was neither wise nor of sound mind .
Also , if there is no providence , how is it that the bodies of animals are arranged with such foresight , that the various members , being disposed in a wonderful manner , discharge their own offices individually ?
The system of providence , he says , contrived nothing in the production of animals ; for neither were the eyes made for seeing , nor the ears for hearing , nor the tongue for speaking , nor the feet for walking ; inasmuch as these were produced before it was possible to speak , to hear , to see , and to walk .
Therefore these were not produced for use ; but use was produced from them .
...
Does wisdom therefore nowhere exist ?
Yes , indeed , it was amongst them , but no one saw it .
Some thought that all things could be known : these were manifestly not wise .
Others thought that nothing could be known ; nor indeed were these wise : the former , because they attributed too much to man ; the latter , because they attributed too little .
A limit was wanting to each on either side .
Where , then , is wisdom ?
It consists in thinking neither that you know all things , which is the property of God ; nor that you are ignorant of all things , which is the part of a beast .
For it is something of a middle character which belongs to man , that is , knowledge united and combined with ignorance .
Knowledge in us is from the soul , which has its origin from heaven ; ignorance from the body , which is from the earth : whence we have something in common with God , and with the animal creation .
...
What course of argument , therefore , led them to the idea of the antipodes ?
They saw the courses of the stars travelling towards the west ; they saw that the sun and the moon always set towards the same quarter , and rise from the same .
But since they did not perceive what contrivance regulated their courses , nor how they returned from the west to the east , but supposed that the heaven itself sloped downwards in every direction , which appearance it must present on account of its immense breadth , they thought that the world is round like a ball , and they fancied that the heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the heavenly bodies ; and thus that the stars and sun , when they have set , by the very rapidity of the motion of the world are borne back to the east .
Therefore they both constructed brazen orbs , as though after the figure of the world , and engraved upon them certain monstrous images , which they said were constellations .
It followed , therefore , from this rotundity of the heaven , that the earth was enclosed in the midst of its curved surface .
But if this were so , the earth also itself must be like a globe ; for that could not possibly be anything but round , which was held enclosed by that which was round .
But if the earth also were round , it must necessarily happen that it should present the same appearance to all parts of the heaven ; that is , that it should raise aloft mountains , extend plains , and have level seas .
And if this were so , that last consequence also followed , that there would be no part of the earth uninhabited by men and the other animals .
Thus the rotundity of the earth leads , in addition , to the invention of those suspended antipodes .
But if you inquire from those who defend these marvellous fictions , why all things do not fall into that lower part of the heaven , they reply that such is the nature of things , that heavy bodies are borne to the middle , and that they are all joined together towards the middle , as we see spokes in a wheel ; but that the bodies which are light , as mist , smoke , and fire , are borne away from the middle , so as to seek the heaven .
I am at a loss what to say respecting those who , when they have once erred , consistently persevere in their folly , and defend one vain thing by another ; but that I sometimes imagine that they either discuss philosophy for the sake of a jest , or purposely and knowingly undertake to defend falsehoods , as if to exercise or display their talents on false subjects .
But I should be able to prove by many arguments that it is impossible for the heaven to be lower than the earth , were is not that this book must now be concluded , and that some things still remain , which are more necessary for the present work .
And since it is not the work of a single book to run over the errors of each individually , let it be sufficient to have enumerated a few , from which the nature of the others may be understood .
...
Wherefore there is nothing else in life on which our plan and condition can depend but the knowledge of God who created us , and the religious and pious worship of Him ; and since the philosophers have wandered from this , it is plain that they were not wise .
They sought wis - dom , indeed ; but because they did not seek it in a right manner , they sunk down to a greater distance , and fell into such great errors , that they did not even possess common wisdom .
For they were not only unwilling to maintain religion , but they even took it away ; while , led on by the appearance of false virtue , they endeavour to free the mind from all fear : and this overturning of religion gains the name of nature .
For they , either being ignorant by whom the world was made , or wishing to persuade men that nothing was completed by divine intelligence , said that nature was the mother of all things , as though they should say that all things were produced of their own accord : by which word they altogether confess their own ignorance .
For nature , apart from divine providence and power , is absolutely nothing .
But if they call God nature , what perverseness is it , to use the name of nature rather than of God !
But if nature is the plan , or necessity , or condition of birth , it is not by itself capable of sensation ; but there must necessarily be a divine mind , which by its foresight furnishes the beginning of their existence to all things .
Or if nature is heaven and earth .
and everything which is created .
nature is not God , but the work of God . "
- Divine Institutes , Book III ; Lucius Lactantius ( ~250-325 CE )
" I will therefore set forth the system of the world , that it may easily be understood both when and how it was made by God ; which Plato , who discoursed about the making of the world , could neither know nor explain , inasmuch as he was ignorant of the heavenly mystery , which is not learned except by the teaching of prophets and God ; ...
But since God has revealed this to us , and we do not arrive at it by conjectures , but by instruction from heaven , we will carefully teach it , that it may at length be evident to those who are desirous of the truth , that the philosophers did not see nor comprehend the truth ; but that they had so slight a knowledge of it , that they by no means perceived from what source that fragrance of wisdom , which was so pleasant and agreeable , breathed upon them .
...
Therefore that is more correct which they derived from Plato , that the world was made by God , and is also governed by His providence .
It was therefore befitting that Plato , and those who held the same opinion , should teach and explain what was the cause , what the reason , for the contriving of so great a work ; why or for the sake of whom He made it .
But the Stoics also say the world was made for the sake of men I hear , but Epicurus is ignorant on what account or who made men themselves .
For Lucretius , when he said that the world was not made by the gods , thus spoke : ' To say , again , that for the sake of men they have willed to set in order the glorious nature of the world ' then he introduced : ' Is sheer folly .
For what advantage can our gratitude bestow on immortal and blessed beings , that for our sake they should take in hand to administer aught ? '
And with good reason .
For they brought forward no reason why the human race was created or established by God .
It is our business to set forth the mystery of the world and man , of which they , being destitute , were able neither to reach nor see the shrine of truth .
Therefore , as I said a little before , when they had assumed that which was true , that is , that the world was made by God , and was made for the sake of men , yet , since their argument failed them in the consequences , they were unable to defend that which they had assumed .
...
Let us now assign the reason why He made man himself .
For if the philosophers had known this , they would either have maintained those things which they had found to be true , or would not have fallen into the greatest errors .
For this is the chief thing ; this is the point on which everything turns .
And if any one does not possess this , the truth altogether glides away from him .
It is this , in short , which causes them to be inconsistent with reason ; for if this had shone upon them , if they had known all the mystery of man , the Academy would never have been in entire opposition to their disputations , and to all philosophy .
As , therefore , God did not make the world for His own sake , because
He does not stand in need of its advantages , but for the sake of man , who has the use of it , so also He made man himself for His own sake .
...
Therefore the opinion entertained by Democritus , and Epicurus , and Dicaearchus concerning the dissolution of the soul is false ; and they would not venture to speak concerning the destruction of souls , in the presence of any magician , who knew that souls are called forth from the lower regions by certain incantations , and that they are at hand , and afford themselves to be seen by human eyes , and speak , and foretell future events ; and if they should thus venture , they would be overpowered by the fact itself , and by proofs presented to them .
But because they did not comprehend the nature of the soul , which is so subtle that it escapes the eyes of the human mind , they said that it perishes . "
- Divine Institutes , Book VII ; Lucius Lactantius ( ~250-325 CE )
Divine Institutes , by early Christian apologist Lucius Lactantius , is a somewhat confused work which demonstrates that the author did not fully understand the philosophies that he was addressing , but nevertheless , the work was addressed to the Greeks and Romans of his time .
In the work Lactantius explains that while all of the Greek philosophies contain some elements of truth , none of them can fully explain the nature of existence .
Lactantius explains that Christians alone have the answers that the philosophers cannot explain because they have been given the answers by God .
Lactantius explains in his works that all true knowledge comes directly from God , and that wisdom comes from religion , and that knowledge is born into the soul .
Lactantius also explained that it was foolish for the Greeks to believe that the earth was round and that the idea of " antipodes " was inherently against the divine teachings of the scriptures .
Antipodes ( " opposing feet " ) is a term that was used to describe people living on the other side of the earth , whose feet would have to be facing the feet on the opposite side of the earth .
The rejection of the Greek understanding that the earth is round was later upheld by Saint Augustine and became official Christian doctrine based on the teachings of the Bible .
" CHAPTER 24 -- OF THE ANTIPODES , THE HEAVEN , AND THE STARS .
How is it with those who imagine that there are antipodes opposite to our footsteps ?
Do they say anything to the purpose ?
Or is there any one so senseless as to believe that there are men whose footsteps are higher than their heads ?
or that the things which with us are in a recumbent position , with them hang in an inverted direction ?
that the crops and trees grow downwards ?
that the rains , and snow , and hail fall upwards to the earth ?
And does any one wonder that hanging gardens are mentioned among the seven wonders of the world , when philosophers make hanging fields , and seas , and cities , and mountains ?
The origin of this error must also be set forth by us .
For they are always deceived in the same manner .
For when they have assumed anything false in the commencement of their investigations , led by the resemblance of the truth , they necessarily fall into those things which are its consequences .
Thus they fall into many ridiculous things ; because those things which are in agreement with false things , must themselves be false .
But since they placed confidence in the first , they do not consider the character of those things which follow , but defend them in every way ; whereas they ought to judge from those which follow , whether the first are true or false .
What course of argument , therefore , led them to the idea of the antipodes ?
They saw the courses of the stars travelling towards the west ; they saw that the sun and the moon always set towards the same quarter , and rise from the same .
But since they did not perceive what contrivance regulated their courses , nor how they returned from the west to the east , but supposed that the heaven itself sloped downwards in every direction , which appearance it must present on account of its immense breadth , they thought that the world is round like a ball , and they fancied that the heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the heavenly bodies ; and thus that the stars and sun , when they have set , by the very rapidity of the motion of the world are borne back to the east .

Country music 's " Redneck Woman " Gretchen Wilson proudly proclaimed in her first hit single that " I keep my Christmas lights on , on my front porch all year long ... "
Well , if you have ever prescribed to that line of thought but have been stung by high electric bills , a new Jackson company could be the remedy no matter who you are and especially if you " ai n't no high class broad .
" I wrote about the company , HolidayLEDs in Sunday 's CitPat , which you can now read again in case you missed it .
It 's a new eCommerce business run by friends Philip C. Curtis and Mike O'Connor that sells Christmas lights using LEDs rather than standard incandescents .
The LEDs come in a variety of shapes , sizes and colors , and are just as bright as standard Christmas lights but use substantially less energy .
They do cost more up front , around $ 20 for one string of lights , compared to $ 3 or $ 4 for a string of lights at a big - box store .
But they quickly pay for themselves .
The mini-lights , the kind typically used on a standard Christmas tree , use 80 percent less energy .
C9 lights , which you might see along a roofline or around a large outdoor display , use 99 percent less energy than traditional incandescents of the same size , Curtis said .
Oh and they have a life expectancy of 50,000 hours .
That 's about 50 years , unless of course , you keep them lit on your ' front porch all year long . '
What do you think ?
Is this something you would consider for your tree this year ?
Would you do it for the cost savings or the positive imapct on the environment , or both ?

The head of the Federal Communications Commission is pressing for the agency to quickly approve plans by AT&T to purchase $ 2.5 billion worth of wireless airwaves from a privately held partnership , sources said on Friday .
REUTERS / Files
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin circulated an order on Thursday among the agency ’s four other commissioners that would allow AT&T to buy the spectrum from Aloha Partners , said the sources with knowledge of the draft order .
Martin circulated the order just before the start of a big FCC auction of valuable government - owned 700 - megahertz airwaves in which AT&T is one of the potential bidders .
AT&T has said the Aloha licenses have coverage for a potential 196 million customers in 281 markets , including 72 of the top 100 U.S. markets in the same 700 - megahertz frequency band .
Aloha obtained the spectrum in a previous FCC auction .
Martin would need the votes of at least two of the FCC ’s four other commissioners to grant approval .
There was no immediate comment from the FCC .
AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris declined to comment .
“ Since there has not been any official action from the FCC , we are not going to comment on speculation . ”
FCC staffers reviewed the deal and raised no objections , the sources said .
The airwaves that went to auction Thursday could eventually bring U.S. consumers more advanced wireless services such as broadband access on mobile phones .
Other qualified bidders in the auction include Verizon Wireless and possible new competitors like Internet company Google Inc GOOG.O , EchoStar Communications Corp DISH.O and Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N .
Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L .

OPM Releases Background Check Information From All Investigations Since 2000
Aug 6 , 2015
In April and June of 2015 , the federal Office of Personnel Management discovered at least two computer security breaches that allowed the theft of more than 20 million personnel records from OPM computer systems .
In the first incident , personal data of approximately 4.2 million current and former US government employees was stolen .
In the second , larger incident the background investigation records of more than 21.5 million federal employees , contractors , and other affiliates was stolen .
These data included , by OPM's own admission , the data from anyone who submitted forms SF - 85 , SF - 85P , and SF - 86 since the year 2000 .
Some reports indicate that the losses may go back much further in time .
The released data include not just the information submitted on the forms , but also the investigation details from interviews with friends , family , co-workers , and neighbors .
The data include personal identifying information from at least 1.8 million non-applicants -- close family members and co-habitants whose data ( including social security numbers ) were provided by applicants as part of security investigations .
In some cases the stolen data include passwords used for the e-QIP system , as well as fingerprint data .
OPM has barely begun individually notifying victims of the personal data release , and so far mostly only government employees .
OPM has created a web page detailing much of the data release here
JPL IT security has sent out two lab - wide notifications , one shortly after the breaches were revealed to include all SF - 85 , SF - 85P , and SF - 86 applicants , and the second recently to forward a newsletter from NASA Ames Research Center with recommendations for how to deal with the release of personal information .
The newsletter can be downloaded here .
The list of things to do to protect oneself is neither short nor easy to implement , and the government is so far providing no support .
The impact of this release of data on the lives of federal employees and contractors , as well as national security , cannot be underestimated .
The release includes complete , validated , collated data with names , social security numbers , residence histories , lists of family and associates and their contact information , information on drug history , medical , psychological , and psychiatric histories , sexual histories , and any other information revealed to investigators .
Such information cannot be unreleased -- it is out and will remain out , likely to be stolen again from or released by whoever copied it from OPM .
It can be used in very targeted " spearphishing " attacks and to potentially blackmail , extort , or otherwise take advantage of government employees and contractors in ways that are socially and economically harmful , and even improperly obtain national security information .

Press Conference on NASA Data Breach
JPL Employees Call for Congressional Investigation into NASA Privacy Breech
November 28 , 2012
Statement from Robert M. Nelson
My name is Robert M. Nelson .
For the last 34 years I have worked as astronomer doing research at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in support of NASA 's Solar System Exploration Program .
I was a co-investigator on NASA 's Voyager Grand Tour of the Solar System and I was the Project Scientist for NASA 's Deep Space 1 mission , NASA 's first mission to flyby and image a comet .
I am currently a member of the Cassini Saturn Orbiter mission .
Six years ago I and my colleagues at JPL were ordered by NASA to submit to background investigations of unlimited scope into the most intimate details of our private lives .
We were asked to ' voluntarily ' agree to allow " ... any investigator , special agent , or other duly accredited representative of the authorized Federal agency conducting my background investigation , to obtain any information relating to my activities from schools , residential management agents , employers , criminal justice agencies , retail business establishments , or other sources of information .
This information may include , but is not limited to , my academic , residential , achievement , performance , attendance , disciplinary , employment history , and criminal history record information . "
Our employer , Caltech , which manages JPL for NASA , assured us that if we did not ' voluntarily ' agree to this investigation we would be fired .
In the Fall of 2007 I and 27 JPL colleagues filed lawsuit in federal district court to stop or limit the scope of these investigations .
After our suit was dismissed in District Court the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found merit in our case and issued an injunction that blocked these open ended probes .
The Ninth Circuit ruled that the investigations had to be narrowly tailored to meet the Government 's specific needs .
Open ended fishing expeditions were ruled out .
One of our principal concerns was that such intimate personal information could not be kept sufficiently secure in the hands of the sprawling government bureaucracy .
Unfortunately , on appeal , the United States Supreme Court lifted the injunction in 2011 .
The Supreme Court held that our personal information was amply protected under the provisions of the Privacy Act .
By June 1 of this year , the background investigations of my JPL colleagues were completed or fully underway .
I left JPL on April 28 .
Recently , tens of thousands of NASA present and former employees and contractors received a communication from NASA informing us that a laptop computer issued to a NASA employee in Washington had been stolen last Oct 31 after being left in a parked car .
The highly personal and sensitive information on the NASA computer was NOT encrypted .
Some of this information includes material gathered by the open ended and unconstrained background investigators of the type described above .
We warned of this possibility five years ago when we filed our lawsuit .
We were ignored by the courts .
Now , unfortunately , by virtue of the cavalier behavior of a NASA bureaucrat our argument has been proven .
Our nightmare of five years ago has become a reality .
We therefore are asking Congress to conduct an investigation into NASA 's behavior in this unsavory affair and to develop new standards which protect the privacy of federal employees .
Robert Nelson Letter to Congressional Representatives
Statement from Dennis Byrnes
I am Dennis Byrnes , Chief Engineer for Flight Dynamics at JPL until my retirement April 1 , 2012 .
As a plaintiff in the HSPD12 Nelson v. NASA case , I was very concerned when I received the letter from Mr. Keegan of NASA regarding the stolen computer which contained personally identifiable information for over 10,000 NASA employee and contractor personnel including myself .
I am further concerned over the company with which NASA has contracted to provide identity theft services for us .
No information on the company was provided nor on the process for choosing them .
I have expressed my concerns and requested information from NASA in an as yet unanswered email sent on Tuesday , November 20 , 2012 .
It follows :
From : Dennis Byrnes
Date : November 20 , 2012 2:03:03 PM
PST
To : hq-privacy@mail.nasa.gov
Cc : richard.j.keegan@nasa.gov
Subject : Stolen Laptop - compromised PII incident
Sirs : I have received the letter from Mr. Keegan indicating that my PII was included on the stolen laptop .
I retired from JPL on April 1 , 2012 .
I require that you tell me precisely what information relating to me was stolen .
I wish to know more about ID Experts than is available on the web .
How were they chosen , was it a competitive bid or do they have some inside advantage at HQ ?
What were the requirements in issuing the contract to them ?
What is the cost of the contract ?
There is no apparent rating or reviews of ID Experts available , how do I know that they are trustworthy or will they be releasing any information that I give them to their affiliates and unknown related companies ?
In your letter you list a number of recommended steps , some of which could be costly both monetarily as well as in inconvenience .
Will NASA also be reimbursing me for these steps ?
This situation is precisely what we warned you of in our suit against you ( Nelson v. NASA ) regarding the implementation of HSPD12 which went to the US Supreme Court .
I look forward to a timely reply .
Thank you , Dennis V. Byrnes
Chief Engineer for Flight Dynamics , JPL ( retired )
Statement from Jim Kulleck
In the past , handling classified material was considered to be a justified reason for demanding that federal employees be subject to extended background investigation .
Due to the recent ruling by the Supreme Court , anyone who now works at JPL has been compelled by NASA to relinquish their right to privacy as a condition of employment .
It appears that there are no longer any objective criteria for these types of investigations .
Those who cut the grass and wash the dishes and the other 98 % of the employees at JPL who do no classified work have had themselves and their families exposed to the potential of identity theft as a result of the cavalier handling of personal data by NASA and the subsequent theft of that data .
During the judicial actions in this case , the plaintiff employees were not provided the opportunity for discovery , complained of the potential for data mishandling and endured false statements which were presented to the Supreme Court by the government .
The Supreme Court summarily ruled in NASA 's favor .
Unless there is clear evidence of illegal activity , neither the government nor businesses should be collecting information about individuals that extends beyond a person 's duties as an employee .
To allow various types of personal and consumer information to be accumulated enables an employer to discriminate against a potential employee without their knowledge .
This , in and of itself , is inconsistent with existing employment law .
Legislation needs to be implemented to correct these problems and protect individual privacy .
A Letter to Colleagues
As you know from the August 25 e-mail from JPL Deputy Director Eugene Tattini , JPL / Caltech has resumed HSPD12 credentialing and the associated investigations .
The e-mail suggests that 25 % of employees are yet to be badged .
Some of those employees have been waiting until the lawsuit was resolved , either anticipating a better process or simply biding time .
Many of them have contacted former plaintiffs in the lawsuit with questions about the process and for guidance on how to proceed .
We address some of those questions ...

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD : Plaintiffs will not oppose a motion to dismiss by Defendants , nor an order of dismissal by this Court , in light of the following factors :
1 ) The Supreme Court ’s decision in this matter , which assumed the existence of the right to informational privacy but refused to decide its scope ; 2 ) the fact that NASA has decided to remove the Suitability Matrix challenged by this injunctive relief action and replace it with a less objectionable list of criteria ; and 3 ) the fact that this action only presented a facial challenge to the background investigation process , and not a challenge to the actual application of such an investigation .
In light of these considerations , plaintiffs hereby stipulate that the matter may be dismissed either by the court ’s own motion or upon motion of Defendants .

U.S. Supreme Court Rules for NASA in JPL Employees ' HSPD - 12 Privacy Case
American Astronomical Society Leadership Write to NASA Deputy Administrator Ms. Lori Garver
Dear Ms. Garver :
We are writing to you in our capacities as President of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) and Vice - Chairman of its largest division , the Division for Planetary Sciences ( DPS ) on the issue of background investigations of members of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory staff , many of whom are AAS - DPS members .
The Supreme Court has ruled that background investigations of federal contract employees like those at JPL are permissible where appropriate , but the nature and breadth of the background investigations remain at the discretion of the individual agency ( Case # 09 - 530 ) .
The decision regarding how NASA proceeds is in the hands of you and Administrator Bolden .
We hope that you might consider our suggestions as you deliberate this question .
We have worked with many of the plaintiffs and submitted an Amicus Curiae brief to the Supreme Court ( the first in the 112 - year history of the AAS ) in connection with this case .
We understand that while the case was motivated by matters of unlimited investigations of personal privacy , we are also strongly concerned that an intrusive background investigation policy will detract from NASA 's ability to draw the highest level of technical talent for the Agency 's mission .
Our view is summarized in the wording of the AAS Amicus Curiae , which said , in part , " Yet , a significant number of US astronomers would be or are unwilling to work in an environment where they are subject to intrusive , open - ended background investigations at issue here .
Their loss will impact the entire professional community - even those individuals that agree to undergo the background investigations . "
...
Please consider the following : 1 ) Homeland Security Presidential Directive # 12 ( HSPD12 ) requires only that a uniform identification badge be established for all employees and contractors at federal facilities .
Background investigations are never mentioned in the directive [ ...]
2 ) Some agencies such as the National Science Foundation did not issue new credentials to employees at facilities under their cognizance .
At Department of Energy - administered FFRDCs where little or no classified work is done ( e.g. , Fermilab ) , HSPD12 procedures were not imposed on workers who did not do classified work [...]
We suggest that an approach modeled on the DOE and NSF implementations would lead to a reasonable closure of the HSPD12 matter .
It is a solution that respects the security concerns of the government , the privacy concerns of JPL employees , and maintains the broadest reasonable access for the astronomical community to participate fully in exciting work that brings us all to NASA .
Yours sincerely ,
[ signed ]
Debra M. Elmegreen , President
American Astronomical Society

Administration official says ' every nugget ' of surveillance info helps terrorists Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 31 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Asst . AG says warrantless wiretap lawsuits harm national security Defending the Bush administration 's efforts to immunize telecommunications companies from any responsibility for their assistance in the likely illegal surveillance of Americans after 9/11 , a top national security official said any discussion of US surveillance efforts aids terrorists .
" Every nugget of information that comes out in the course of these investigations helps our enemies , " Assistant Attorney General Kenneth L. Wainstein , who oversees the Justice Department 's national security division , said Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
Wainstein was testifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is considering legislation to update a foreign surveillance law .
A key sticking point in the debate over the government 's surveillance authority is whether the updated law will provide legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the National Security Agency 's warrantless eavesdropping on Americans ' phone calls .
President Bush authorized the emergency surveillance , which proceeded without court oversight , immediately after Sept. 11 , but many of the program 's details remain unknown .
The administration 's immunity proposal would invalidate more than three dozen lawsuits alleging that telephone and internet providers violated customers ' privacy when they handed the government access to their networks without legal justification .
Wainstein said the lawsuits filed against companies like AT&T and Verizon should not move forward in court because of the classified nature of the program in question ; if people are seeking redress , any lawsuits should be directed at the government , he said .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the ranking Republican on the committee , was skeptical as to why telecommunications companies deserve protection from the suits , and he asked why the government could n't just indemnify the companies from paying any damages that could be rewarded .
" If we are to close the courthouse door to some 40 litigants who are not claiming their privacy was violated , it seems to me that we are closing a major avenue of redress , " Specter said .
A complete lack of discussion of the program , which the administration seems to be inviting , " is just an open invitation for this kind of conduct in the future . "
Wainstein seemed to argue that the lawsuits ' very existence served as another weapon in al Qaeda 's arsenal .
Anything that keeps the lawsuits alive " exposes information about sources and methods , " the witness said .
" Even just the filing of lawsuits and allegations made [ in them ] ... can compromise sources and methods . "
Specter was incredulous at such a broad claim .
" Oh really ? " the Pennsylvania Republican shot back .
" If [ plaintiffs filing the suits ] know something it must be in the public domain . "
The Judiciary Committee shares jurisdiction over surveillance laws with the Select Committee on Intelligence , which reported its own legislation earlier this month that would grant immunity to telecoms alleged to have participated in the program .
Administration finally hands over wiretap docs A long - running battle between the Judiciary Committee and the White House over classified legal justifications of the president 's warrantless wiretapping scheme came to an end yesterday when the administration finally relented .
Committee members were briefed in secret Tuesday and given access to documents outlining the program .
Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) said he would not even consider a bill granting immunity until committee members saw the secret justifications .
Whether the provision remains in the bill remains unclear , but Leahy pressed Wainstein on why immunity is even necessary if -- as the administration continues to claim -- the warrantless wiretapping was legal to begin with .
He charged that the government was more interested in avoiding oversight and accountability and he said lawsuits against the telecoms are the only recourse for citizens seeking answers about whether the administration overstepped the Constitution .
" If we give blanket amnesty to the companies , you 're not going to be able to sue the government , " Leahy said .
" They 're going to be able to provide their own amnesty by saying ' state secrets . ' "
Wednesday 's hearing served as something of a refresher for the committee .
Wainstein and Director of National Intelligence made the rounds of House and Senate committees to testify on the FISA updates in February .
Leahy has the option of producing his own bill that would eliminate the telecom immunity .
A Judiciary Committee aide says he has not drafted new legislation , but Leahy has not ruled out the possibility either .
A House measure to update FISA was pulled from the floor earlier this month when Republicans introduced a politically charged but ultimately meaningless motion that would have killed the bill , which did not grant immunity to telecoms .
House leaders are working to bring the measure , known as the RESTORE Act , back to the floor soon , and an aide to a progressive House Democrat tells RAW STORY that it is " unlikely " that telecom immunity will be put back in the bill .
Before Congress recessed in August , lawmakers rushed through a temporary FISA update that critics say provides too little court oversight to protect Americans ' rights .
That law , the Protect America Act , expires in February , and Congressional leaders have said they will send a bill for President Bush to sign before that deadline .

First , thanks to all who contributed ideas .
You may have an entirely different opinion on the most important energy stories .
Feel free to share it .
Many of these stories were contributed by various readers .
Comments by readers are italicized .
If you want to know who wrote what , you can see the entire comment thread here .
1 . Oil price soars as media becomes Peak Oil aware
One reason I felt pretty safe in making the $ 1,000 bet on oil prices is that a move from $ 60 - the price in January - to $ 100 - the price at which I would lose the bet - would be unprecedented .
Of course a worldwide peak in oil production will also be unprecedented , and I expect oil prices to soar when that happens .
While I still do n't think we have quite peaked , what did happen is that Peak Oil awareness really hit the mainstream in 2007 .
I started noticing a great many stories on Peak Oil ( and quite a few on Peak Lite ) , especially following the ASPO Conference in October .
This was right in the middle of the sharp run-up in prices .
So I believe that a major factor contributing to the fast run-up was the sudden realization by a critical mass of people that Peak Oil is on top of us .
In that case , the value of oil will be much higher .
In addition to record oil prices , back in the spring we saw record - high gasoline prices as a result of sustained , record - low gasoline inventories .
Conditions are currently favoring new record - high gasoline prices in 2008 .
2. Criticism of biofuels mounts
The bloom comes off the biofuel rose .
European studies showed oil - palm biodiesel was actually worse for the environment due to tropical rainforest destruction , and US corn ethanol plants lost money because of overbuilding .
A general biofuel backlash took root due to higher food prices and other side effects .
While I was criticizing corn ethanol before criticizing corn ethanol was cool , in 2007 the media started asking critical questions about water usage , pollution from industrial corn farming , and the impact of ethanol mandates on food prices .
3 . The Chevy Volt is announced
GM has dedicated a full product team and allocated a plant for mass production -- the first time in history an electric car has achieved such status .
Years after GM killed the electric car , they are bringing it back in the form of the Chevy Volt .
I have long advocated the need for the electrification of transportation as one of the key elements in any Peak Oil mitigation plan .
Therefore , I am very pleased to see GM making another effort at electric cars .
4. Nanosolar begins to deliver
Cost - effective solar power would be a very big silver BB in a Peak Oil mitigation plan .
Nanosolar has the potential to deliver a game - changing thin - film photovoltaic technology .
If you do n't know much about Nanosolar , check out this interview with their CEO : 10 Questions for Nanosolar CEO Martin Roscheisen
However , the potential for cost effective solar power also highlights the desperate need to tackle and solve the problem of energy storage for intermittent sources of energy like wind and solar power .
Hopefully we will see some breakthroughs there in 2007 .
5. LS9 starts up
For years I have dreamed of a microbe that eats garbage and excretes hydrocarbons .
The beauty of such a system would be that the hydrocarbons would just phase out of solution , thus ensuring a low - energy purification step .
If you think about it , the concept is not that far - fetched .
The human body produces fats and fatty acids that are not too far - removed from the hydrocarbons that make up gasoline or diesel .
There is no reason , in principle , that a microbe could n't be designed to do just that .
The difficulty lies in understanding the metabolic pathways well enough to modify them to produce the target molecule without severely compromising or killing the microbe .
This is exactly what LS9 - the " Renewable Petroleum Company " , is attempting to do .
And they have certainly assembled a team that just may pull it off .
6. Range Fuels breaks ground
In November Range Fuels - formerly Vinod Khosla 's Kergy venture - announced the groundbreaking of the first commercial " cellulosic " ethanol plant in the U.S.
While I dispute the terminology ( as I explained in this essay , it is actually a gasification process , which is not specific to cellulose ) , the process does have a chance to be a success in the long - run .
Short - term , I believe they will remain highly dependent on generous subsidies because the capital costs for gasification processes are so high .
But on down the road I think gasification makes a lot more sense than most fermentation processes .
One thing that I would have done differently would have been to produce diesel instead of ethanol .
Once syngas is produced in a gasification step , there are many different products that can be made .
It is not particularly efficient to produce ethanol in this process , but this is the kind of thing you end up with when the government is picking technology winners .
I do think Range Fuels has a high likelihood of becoming a significant technology .
What little information is available certainly sounds promising , including the result from EBMUD that the Klepper gasifier was the most efficient .
7 . First application for US nuclear plant in 30 years
NRG announces first application for US nuclear plant in 30 years :
NRG South Texas Nuclear
They propose to use GE's Advanced Boiling Water Reactor technology .
My personal belief is that we are going to need nuclear power to continue making a significant contribution toward our electricity needs .
This will be especially true if electric transport takes hold .
Therefore , I think it is a very big story that 2007 saw the first application for a new U.S. nuclear plant in 30 years .
8. Carbon capture & sequestration moves forward
The FutureGen alliance announces the site for its demonstration plant on Tuesday , Dec. 18 :
FutureGen Announcement
For those not familiar with it , FutureGen is a clean coal demonstration plant that will include carbon capture and sequestration .
There are 4 finalist sites .
Two in Illinois and two in Texas .
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate commercial scale CCS technology .
FutureGen selected Mattoon , IL for their site .
FutureGen runs a combined cycle instead of the single cycle of existing coal plants .
Combined cycle plants can achieve 50 - 60 % thermal efficiency vs. the 33 % typical of single cycle , so it 's quite possible FutureGen will deliver more kWh / ton of coal than existing plants .
9 . Progress on next generation biofuels
The biofuel spotlight turned to the future .
Dozens of startups focused on cellulosic ethanol , gasification and other next - gen processes competed for headlines with " green diesel " , butanol and other biofuel initiatives from the oil majors .
Most of the oil majors have taken a pass on the ethanol craze , but they are looking at other biofuels .
2007 saw announcements from BP that they would team with D1 Oils to produce biodiesel from jatropha ; from ConocoPhillips that they would team with Tyson Foods to produce " green diesel " from waste animal fats ; and that BP and Dupont would team up to produce bio-butanol .
( I wrote a reality check on bio-butanol here ) .
10 . US Navy funds Bussard Fusion
I think you have to include the US Navy funding Bussard Fusion in there :
http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=3139619&C=navwar
Bussard died a couple months ago .
I had really given up on fusion , but his work actually appears to have a reasonable change to work .
Hopefully with more funding his team will be able to make it work .
Yes , Dr. Bussard 's work will be carried on .
First step is to construct WB - 7 and replicate the results achieved with WB - 6 .
Hopefully by the end of April 2008 .
If that works , then on to WB - 8 , and then an actual power generating plant .
The rest of the list ( mostly contributed by readers , and in no particular order ) , many of which could have easily been in the Top 10 list :
11 . King Coal is still king
If we look for the stories that did not attract attention , surely one of the big ones has to be the continued surprising vitality of the international coal industry .
King Coal has officially been dead for a long time .
Who would have predicted that , 10 years after Kyoto , coal would once more be where it's at , supplying more Btus to the world than ever before ?
12 . US Coal Plant cancellations , headlined by TXU cancelling 8 of 11 planned plants .
CO2 , the primary driver behind the other half of our top 10 stories , has long played in Europe but will only achieve global influence by spreading through the US into the developing world .
2007 's coal plant cancellations marked the tipping point .
13 . Al Gore wins Nobel Prize for work on Global Warming
Gore 's tireless efforts to educate the world on Global Warming was recognized with this year 's Nobel Peace Prize .
Tiny Carthage , Tennessee now claims two Nobel Laureates .
( Cordell Hull is the other ) .
14 . Shell releases details of their shale oil process
Probably the most important energy announcement was Shell 's release of info on their proprietary in - situ process for generating oil from oil shale .
Could open a whole new branch of the oil industry , put a cap on the price of oil from conventional fields , and thereby inject some realism into windy dreams .
But it turns out that Shell has been working towards this for about a quarter of a century .
" Incremental advances " indeed !
15 . Resource nationalization grows
While the seizure of the assets of international oil companies by Hugo Chavez got the most press , many other countries are moving to nationalize their oil resources .
Many other countries , and even states like Alaska , are also passing laws to increase their tax revenues from the extraction of oil .
The U.S. needs to sit up and take notice , because this will further constrain supplies .
We can't continue to count on a steady supply of oil from countries who do n't like us , yet we lack the political will to reduce our dependence on these countries .
16 . New efficiency record for silicon PV - 42.8 percent from sunlight at standard terrestrial conditions
http://www.physorg.com/news104501218.html
The highly efficient VHESC solar cell uses a novel lateral optical concentrating system that splits solar light into three different energy bins of high , medium and low , and directs them onto cells of various light sensitive materials to cover the solar spectrum .
The system delivers variable concentrations to the different solar cell elements .
The concentrator is stationary with a wide acceptance angle optical system that captures large amounts of light and eliminates the need for complicated tracking devices .
In a way I find the Nanosolar story more compelling since they are actually in commercial production now .
Still , the prospect of high efficiency PV without using exotic and / or toxic materials gives me hope .
17 . Manpower shortages in the energy sector
Big Oil's Talent Hunt
From the article :
ConocoPhillips ( COP ) has grand plans .
With demand for oil soaring , the company announced on Dec. 7 that it will boost its exploration and production budget by 8 % , to $ 11 billion , a war chest intended to fund massive projects from Canada to China to the Caspian Sea .
But there 's a potential obstacle to the company 's vision : not enough people to get the work done .
Half of Conoco 's employees are eligible for retirement within five years .
Unless older workers can be replaced , Conoco 's expansion could be costlier and slower than planned .
In an interview with BusinessWeek , CEO James J. Mulva said that the lack of talent is one of the most dangerous threats to his company 's long - term health .
" People are a big concern , " he said .
This is not just a big oil story .
Lack of workers is hitting all sectors of the energy industry .
It seems that college students would rather be lawyers or investment bankers than scientists and engineers .
18 . Texas surpassed California in wind energy
This signals a shift in wind from high - cost , subsidized eco-darling to cost - effective energy source .
As the low - cost provider , wind now thrives in low bureaucracy states such as former oil - king Texas .
Meanwhile high - regulation states such as California lag behind .
19 . Potential PV improvement
Potential improvement on PV front
Transparent electrodes created from atom - thick carbon sheets could make solar cells and LCDs without depleting precious mineral resources , say researchers in Germany .
Solar cells , LCDs , and some other devices , must have transparent electrodes in parts of their designs to let light in or out .
These electrodes are usually made from indium tin oxide ( ITO ) but experts calculate that there is only 10 years ' worth of indium left on the planet , with LCD panels consuming the majority of existing stocks .
" There is not enough indium on earth for the future development of devices using it , " says Linjie Zhi of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz , Germany .
" It is also not very stable , so you have to be careful during the fabrication process . "
20 . Study analyzes off shore wind in US Northeast
http://www.physorg.com/news89650495.html
The wind resource off the Mid-Atlantic coast could supply the energy needs of nine states from Massachusetts to North Carolina , plus the District of Columbia -- with enough left over to support a 50 percent increase in future energy demand -- according to a study by researchers at the University of Delaware and Stanford University .
The study marks the first empirical analysis in the United States of a large - scale region 's potential offshore wind - energy supply using a model that links geophysics with wind - electric technology -- and that defines where wind turbines at sea may be located in relation to water depth , geology and " exclusion zones " for bird flyways , shipping lanes and other uses .
21 . A123Systems mass produces next generation lithium batteries
Shipping in DeWalt 's 2007 line of 36V cordless power tools , these new cells mark the 5th wave of rechargeable batteries ( lead - acid , NiCad , NiMH , Li-ion and now advanced lithium ) .
Advanced lithium chemistries from A123 and dozens of other vendors offer the possibility of cost - effective plug - in hybrids as well as applications in the electrical grid .
22 . Electricity shortages , particularly in the developing world
Some appear to be related to climate change -- droughts that require major hydro cutbacks .
Some are clearly due to oil prices / supplies -- poor countries that burn heavy diesel in their power plants and can't afford it at the new world prices .
Some are due to bad bets on fuel sources -- natural gas generators put in , and the gas supply declining sooner than planned .
23 . Solar thermal heats up
For decades the SEGS parabolic trough plant in California 's Mojave desert stood alone as the only large - scale CSP plant on earth , but 2007 saw a rebirth of this technology with the inauguration of the 64MW Nevada Solar One plant and construction of plants in Spain , Australia and elsewhere .
California utilities have ordered up to 1750 MW of capacity from dish - Stirling purveyor Stirling Energy Systems and startups such as Ausra are pushing the price / performance barrier with linear Fresnel architectures .
24 . First Solar market value hits $ 20 billion
As the first mass producer of non-silicon thin film PV , FSLR cashed in big - time in 2007 .
Their $ 1.40 / W manufacturing cost is a huge competitive advantage , yielding fat profits and an eye - popping 200 % growth rate .
True to their name , First Solar got out of the gate first , but other non-Si players are still in the race .
Companies using CIGS , including the much - hyped but yet - to - deliver Nanosolar , promise to break the $ 1 / W barrier .
25 . Cooper Pairs in insulators
http://www.aip.org/pnu/2007/split/849-1.html
One of the AIP 's top stories of the year , this discovery may well help us reach a better understanding of superconductivity and insulators both .
Superconductivity is of course a holy grail in energy research , and while this discovery does n't directly lead to a room temp superconductor , it does add to the fundamental knowledge of material in the solid state .
26 . Medvedev slated to take over from Putin
http://en.rian.ru/russia/20071217/92858987.html
Essentially Putin's Russia will continue , and that has direct implication for all the fossil fuel industry in Asia , regarding everything from global warming to export control to defense postures .
Putin's Russia , one of an energy oligarchy , will continue to express those policies likely for a good portion of the 21st century .
27 . Conditions in Iraq improve enough to get the oil industry back online
http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=54099
Opening the possibility that Iraq just might return to a functioning member of OPEC has direct implications on the availability of oil for import around the world .
28 . USAF test flight of transport aircraft C - 17 using CTL synthetic fuel
http://www.enn.com/pollution/article/24117
This heralds the onset of CTL and likely portrays our ( US ) future over the next couple of decades .
29 .
And now , for my wildcat speculation of the most important news item :
Namibia : Expert Confident About Oil Reserves
Southwest Africa will turn out to be a major oil exporting region over the next couple of decades , slowing the decrease in available net exports of oil .
30 .
The response of the global economy to the large increase in oil prices
Most people would have probably assumed that $ 90 oil would have caused mayhem in the global economy a year or two ago .
Yet the effect has been relatively muted .
I think this says a lot about how effectively individuals , businesses ( and hats off to alternative energy firms ) , and governments have responded to increasing oil prices over the long term .
Oil now has a much smaller ( I believe around 50 % ) impact per GDP than it did in the 1970's in most of the big western economies , including the US .
31 . Tesla troubles
A not - positive but nevertheless noteworthy story is Tesla Motors recent troubles with putting the final touches on its long - awaited car , particularly with the transmission failure and the management shuffling .
And I love this suggestion for 2008 .
What a great idea this would be :
My favorite energy story for 2008 would be -- Congress recognizes they cannot pick winners , and instead sets up a multi-billion dollar X - Prize competition for the first three alternate energy sources to supply reliable commercial - scale power at costs competitive with fossils .
So those were the energy stories that I , or various readers thought were significant in 2007 .
Were there other significant stories that we missed ?
Looking back at the list , many ( most ? ) of the stories were not anticipated at the beginning of the year .
So , who knows what 2008 will bring .
Any thoughts ?
New Zealand : Charges dropped after “ anti- terror ” police raids
By John Braddock
30 November 2007
New Zealand Solicitor - General , David Collins QC , announced on November 8 that terrorism charges would not proceed against 12 of the 17 people detained in a massive “ anti- terror ” police operation three weeks earlier .
Far from backing down , however , the Labour government has indicated its determination to exploit the lurid but untested claims surrounding the incident to justify even more draconian counter - terrorism laws .
The arrests were carried out on October 15 following raids involving 300 police in Auckland , Wellington , Palmerston North , Hamilton , Christchurch , Whakatane and Ruatoki .
Sixteen people appeared in the Auckland District Court on firearms charges , which remain in place .
Twelve had their cases referred to the solicitor - general for consideration on October 29 under the Terrorism Suppression Act ( TSA ) .
The Act requires that Attorney - General Michael Cullen approve such charges , but he delegated the authority to the solicitor - general .
The raids took place in the traditional homelands of the Tuhoe Maori tribe in the remote Uruwera Ranges .
The entire area was placed under siege as armed police and officers wearing camouflage gear arrived via vehicle convoys and a helicopter .
Police claimed that between 20 and 40 people had been participating in bush training camps in the Uruweras , involving the use of firearms and other weapons .
The operation was followed by a full - blown media scare campaign about “ terrorists ” training for attacks against prominent public buildings and figures .
The dropping of the terrorism charges confirms the threadbare character of the case against the 12 .
Collins stated that while the police had provided evidence that a number of the accused were involved in “ very disturbing activities ” , it was insufficient to meet the “ high threshold ” of evidential requirements for charges to be laid under the TSA .
He was quick to praise the police for their “ professionalism and integrity ” and highlight the supposed deficiencies of the legislation .
Collins criticised the TSA as “ unnecessarily complex , incoherent and as a result almost impossible to apply to the domestic circumstances observed by the police in this case ” .
The government promptly declared it would act on Collins ’s comments and refer the Act to the Law Commission for review and strengthening .
According to Prime Minister Helen Clark , the main issue was that in its current form , the legislation was designed with external terrorist threats in mind , and was never framed to deal with domestic cases — a shortcoming that would be addressed in any rewrite of the law .
The hysteria surrounding the raids has already provided a convenient pretext for pushing through long - planned amendments to the 2002 Act .
These were reported back to parliament from a select committee within days of the raids and easily passed their second reading on October 24 , less than two weeks later .
Among the new provisions is a vague new definition of a terrorist act as one which is intended to “ induce terror in a civilian population ” .
The charge carries a possible life sentence .
The changes also remove the power to designate “ terrorist ” groups from the High Court and place it solely in the prime minister ’s hands .
There has been rising opposition to the police raids and plans to undermine basic democratic rights through changes to the anti-terror laws .
Demonstrations involving several thousand people have taken place .
These included a hikoi , or protest march , by 200 members of the Tuhoi tribe and their supporters .
They travelled hundreds of kilometres from Whakatane to Wellington via several regional centres to protest their treatment outside parliament .
Simmering tensions erupted on November 3 outside the Labour Party conference .
Delegates had to run a gauntlet amid cries of “ shame ” from 150 protesters as they entered the venue .
The protesters alleged that a Labour Party delegate assaulted one or more of their number .
Television footage appeared to show conference delegate Len Richards using a megaphone to strike a protester in the face .
The altercation happened after Richards and fellow delegate Jill Ovens emerged to purportedly attempt to tell protesters the Service and Food Workers Union , which Ovens represents , was “ on their side ” .
Coverage of the incident overshadowed Clark ’s keynote speech , in which she justified the police operation .
Breaching legal restraints on sub judice , the prime minister virtually declared that the accused were guilty , saying it was “ distressing and abhorrent ” for a “ disaffected ” group to be engaged in paramilitary training as alleged by the police .
The clash with protesters underlined the growing isolation of the Labour government which , after eight years in office , has presided over unprecedented attacks on democratic rights and social conditions .
Various erstwhile “ lefts ” and middle class radicals have stepped in to defend Labour .
Chief among these has been commentator Chris Trotter who used two of his weekly Dominion Post newspaper columns , entitled “ From the Left ” , to justify the raids .
Trotter glowingly described Police Commissioner Howard Broad as an “ honourable and decent police officer and no redneck ” and condemned the victims of the raids as “ arrogant ” for turning their backs on the long traditions of peaceful protest and “ incorporating firearms and explosives into their political repertoire ” .
In fact , as the decision to drop the anti-terror charges demonstrates , the evidence against the accused would not have stood up in court .
The police were clearly keen to use the operation to establish a precedent for widespread surveillance and eavesdropping under the anti-terror laws .
Hundreds of pages of intercepted communications as well as photographic and video surveillance will not now be tested in court as they were obtained under warrants issued under the Terrorism Act and can only be used to support charges under that act .
Collins admitted that it was “ unlikely ” the interception warrants could have been obtained under any other legislation .
Prominent Queen ’s Counsel , Peter Williams , engaged by the Tuhoe tribe to look into a possible class action suit , described the police tactics used in the raids as illegal .
Speaking after visiting the Ruatoki area , Williams said the police did not have the right to take the occupants of one particular house into custody unless they had been charged with offences .
People were taken into custody at gunpoint .
Some residents , including young children , were detained for many hours , and the armed raids and searches were terrifying for the innocent adults and children exposed to them .
The dropping of charges was the second failure of a major anti-terrorism case in little more than a month .
In September a high - profile “ security risk ” immigration case against Algerian asylum seeker , Ahmed Zaoui , foundered when the Security Intelligence Service ( SIS ) was forced into an ignominious u-turn and drop its opposition to Zaoui remaining in the country after declaring for five years he was a suspected terrorist and should be deported .
In a bid to salvage the Uruwera Ranges terror scare , two major Fairfax - owned daily newspapers — the Dominion Post and Christchurch Press — took the extraordinary step on November 14 of defying a legal injunction and publishing portions of the 156 - page affidavit of secret police evidence that had been rejected by Collins .
The affidavit was obviously leaked to the press by the government or the police in order to justify their actions .
Clark publicly endorsed the decision to publish , despite its dubious legality , saying that “ everyone ” was frustrated by not knowing what was “ worrying the police ” .
The Dominion Post published a sensational front - page report , headed “ The Terrorism Files ” , selectively highlighting bits of conversation threatening to blow up opposition leader John Key should he become prime minister , use extreme violence to “ hurt ” the country , engage in “ guerrilla ” war , blow up installations and kill “ Pakeha ” or European New Zealanders .
Some conversations referred to the use of IRA and Al Qaeda training manuals .
Much of this could have been just hot air and braggadocio .
None of the material in the police affidavit suggests that any of the accused had taken any concrete steps to put their threats into action .
One of the accused , Aucklander Jamie Lockett , described as a 46 - year - old “ bodyguard - turned private prosecutor ” , is on record as claiming that he and others accused knew their conversations were being bugged and deliberately set out to “ wind up ” the police .
The presence of police provocateurs among the “ terrorists ” can also not be ruled out , given the lengthy period of time they were under police surveillance .
A far smaller article in the New Zealand Herald on November 17 reported that the October 15 raids turned up a tiny arsenal — just four weapons and 230 rounds of ammunition .
The police have not revealed what other weapons were seized in other property searches using warrants obtained under the Terrorism Act .
Of the 16 people facing firearms offences , just two have been charged on the basis of items found during the huge police operation on October 15 .
The New Zealand terror scare follows the pattern of similar operations around the world — sensationalised media coverage of “ terrorist threats ” , the imposition of anti-democratic legislation tearing up long - established democratic rights and legal precedents , extensive police surveillance and the heavy mobilisation of security forces .
Under the guise of fighting terrorism , police - state measures are being prepared for use against wider social unrest as social inequality and economic instability deepen .
Do We Need a Third Party ?
Most Americans Say Yes .
In a hypothetical three - way race , would Bloomberg hurt Democrats or the GOP ?
July 12 , 2007  -- WASHINGTON — Most Americans , unhappy with both the Republican president and the Democratic - controlled Congress , say it 's time for a third political party .
Not that they 're necessarily ready to vote for one .
In a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday , 58 % say the two major parties are doing " such a poor job " that a third party is needed .
Just a third say the established parties " do an adequate job of representing the American people . "
In a hypothetical three - way race for president , the man who has parried questions about whether he 'll run as an independent candidate , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , takes 12 % of the vote in a race that also includes Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rudy Giuliani .
Clinton leads Giuliani , 45 % - 39 % .
Whom does Bloomberg hurt ?
He draws from both but seems to nick Giuliani , his predecessor at City Hall , a bit more .
With Bloomberg in the race , Clinton beats Giuliani by 6 points .
In a two - way contest in the USA TODAY Poll in June , the New York senator led him by 4 points , 50 % - 46 % .
Bloomberg draws 5 % of Democrats , 8 % of Republicans , 22 % of independents — and 18 % of those who want a third party .
The billionaire businessman has appeal down the middle of the electorate .
He does better with those who have annual household incomes of $ 30,000 to $ 74,999 than among those who earn more or less than that .
He does better among moderates than either liberals or conservatives .
Predictably , he does twice as well among city dwellers than those in rural areas .
Surprisingly , he also does better among those in the Midwest than those on the East or West coasts .
He 's stronger among men than women .
And he is relatively well - known : Just 11 % have never heard of him .
Among those who have , 36 % have a favorable view of him ; 27 % have an unfavorable one .
John Bibby , professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee and co-author of Two Parties — or More ?
The American Political System , is skeptical that a third party in general or Bloomberg in particular has any realistic chance of winning the White House in 2008 .
" American politics is structured against it , " he says .
Still , the current political climate is receptive to a third - party appeal , he says , as it was in 1992 , when Ross Perot claimed one - fifth of the popular vote .
Americans are " distrustful of politicians in general , and when you have not much seemingly being accomplished by either the Congress or the administration , it 's kind of a natural reaction , " Bibby says .
" People know the system is broken , " says Doug Bailey , co-founder of Unity08 , a group that proposes to field a third - party ticket in 2008 .
Neither side now gets high marks from the public .
President Bush 's disapproval rating reached a high of 66 % in the July Gallup Poll , and the June Poll put Congress ' disapproval rating even higher , at 71 % .
Bloomberg has dismissed talk of an independent presidential bid that was fueled when he announced last month he was dropping his GOP affiliation .
He had been a life - long Democrat until he decided to run for mayor in 2001 .
He may be part of a trend : 43 % of those surveyed in the new survey identify themselves as independents — significantly more than call themselves Democrats or Republicans .
That proportion has n't been higher in close to a decade .
BEIRUT , Jan 31 ( Reuters ) - Lebanon 's prime minister said on Thursday that an Israeli report on the war against Hezbollah guerrillas in 2006 set the scene for a possible future conflict and failed to address " Israel 's crimes against Lebanon " .
The Israeli government - appointed Winograd Commission issued a report on Wednesday that criticised the conduct of the army and government during the war , but which endorsed key decisions at the time by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
" The report calls for preparation for the next war , which shows that Israel has not learned the appropriate lesson from its defeat , " a statement from Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora 's media office said .
" The enemy 's aims towards Lebanon have stayed the same -- that is attacking Lebanon in the future . "
Israel 's retired Supreme Court Justice Eliahu Winograd said in a speech presenting his report that Israel must seek peace with its neighbours .
" At the same time , seeking peace or managing the conflict must come from a position of social , political and military strength , and through the ability and willingness to fight for the state , its values and the security of its population even in the absence of peace . "
About 1,200 people in Lebanon , mostly civilians , and 159 Israelis , mostly soldiers , were killed in the war , triggered after Hezbollah guerrillas captured two Israeli soldiers and killed eight in a cross - border raid .
Siniora also said the report did not mention the war 's cost on Lebanon .
Israel pounded the Hezbollah bastions of southern Beirut and south Lebanon with aircraft , warships and artillery .
It also hit other parts of the country .
Hezbollah fired about 4,000 rockets into northern Israel .
" The report does not contain any mention of the crimes Israel committed against Lebanon ... or of the massacres against civilians ... the report also does n't mention huge destruction to infrastructure most of which were hospitals , schools , places of worship , bridges and residential buildings . "
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said this month he doubted Israel had the political and military leadership and qualified army to launch a new war on Lebanon .

I really can not believe this is the guy the establishment is pinning their hopes on :
Mitt Romney has been forced to get into some serious verbal gymnastics over his previous declaration about seeing his father , the late Michigan Gov. George Romney , marching with Martin Luther King .
A close examination of the historical records shows that the elder Romney , while he was a strong support of civil rights , never actually appeared with King .
“ I ’ve tried to be as accurate as I can be , ” Romney told reporters .
“ If you look at the literature or look at the dictionary , the term ‘ saw ’ includes being aware of — in the sense I ’ve described . ”
“ I ’m an English literature major , ” he added , after the questions did n’t stop .
“ When we say I saw the Patriots win the World Series , it does n’t necessarily mean you were there . ”
( Yes , he did speak off the cuff about the idea of a football team winning the World Series . )
And then you have this ( via Sully ) :
Mitt Romney went a step further in a 1978 interview with the Boston Herald .
Talking about the Mormon Church and racial discrimination , he said : “ My father and I marched with Martin Luther King Jr. through the streets of Detroit . ”
Yesterday , Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom acknowledged that was not true .
“ Mitt Romney did not march with Martin Luther King , ” he said in an e-mail statement to the Globe .
When I was a kid , I saw my dad quarterback the Steelers as they became World Series Champions .
If , of course , your definition of saw means “ I imagined the shit while mildly buzzed from scotch and thinking it would sound cool and impress people . ”
Seriously - the Republican field is just an exercise in absurdity .
The leading candidates are a flat - earth religious huckster , a serial liar , and a cross - dresser with an authoritarian streak and mob ties .
Is this really the best the GOP has to offer ?

Cannabis use among young people has fallen significantly since its controversial reclassification in 2004 , according to the latest British Crime Survey figures published today .
The Home Office figures showed the proportion of 16 to 24 - year - olds who had used cannabis in the past year fell from 25 % when the change in the law was introduced to 21 % in 2006 / 07 - still about 1.3 million users .
The impact of the new " confiscate and warn " policy towards those found with cannabis was also reflected in a 54 % rise in the number of cannabis seizures to 117,297 , and in the 63,331 formal warnings issued in 2005 , according to the figures .
The increasing spread of the homegrown cannabis industry in Britain can be seen in figures showing that police and customs seized 208,357 cannabis plants - 82 % of them in groups of less than 50 .
In total , police and customs seized 69 tonnes of cannabis , 49 tonnes of which was " traditional " imported resin and 20 tonnes of which was herbal cannabis .
Gordon Brown has ordered a fresh review of the legal status of cannabis after warnings of links between much more potent strains coming on to the market and mental illness .
But the latest figures suggested that the downward trend in cannabis consumption since 1998 - when 28 % of 16 to 24 - year - olds reported using the drug - had accelerated .
Among all age groups , 10 % of people said they had used an illegal drug in the past year - about 3.1 million people .
This was the lowest level since the statistics were first published in 1996 .
The figures showed cocaine powder use continued to rise , with 2.6 % of adults saying they had used it in the past year .
Use of ecstasy and heroin remained stable .
For the first time , the BCS survey measured ketamine use in England and Wales and estimated that about 0.3 % , or under 100,000 , of the adult population had tried it in the past year .
Librarians in Queens do not like to talk about the scofflaws who rack up fines for late books .
They prefer to call them “ clients ” or “ patrons ” who owe “ extended - use fees . ”
Competing against a tide of video games and cable shows , they are loath to scare away anyone who wants to read .
But their patience has limits .
When provoked , they play hardball .
Eleven years ago , the Queens Library system , the largest in the nation by circulation , hired a professional enforcer to collect the 25 - cents - a - day late fines as well as missing library materials from books to DVDs to rare musical scores .
The gambit has paid off handsomely .
The haul so far : $ 11.4 million , about half of that in fines .
That ’s a lot of quarters .
Borrowers who fail to return Queens Library books can be reported to a collection agency and to a credit bureau , with a damaged credit rating as a result  a tactic that so shocked one Far Rockaway rabbi that he filed a lawsuit .
The collection policy also has pulled libraries  places where generations of children have learned moral lessons about returning what they borrow  into the debate on just how much punishment is appropriate for failing to return a library book .

Galaxy M74 , a spiral galaxy that evolved in the early universe
They discovered ancient galaxies , about one - tenth the size of the Milky Way , which were among the first to form in the Universe .
Over billions of years , galaxies like these merged to form much bigger spiral galaxies such as our own .
The findings were outlined at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin , Texas .
The ancient objects  known as Lyman alpha-emitting galaxies - are fertile breeding grounds for new stars .
Astronomers see them as they looked when the Universe was just two billion years old .
Galactic descendents
According to cosmological theory , the small galaxies which existed in the early Universe grew into larger ones by merging with one another .
Other early galaxies had previously been observed , but these were much bigger , and were destined to evolve not into spiral galaxies , but into a different type known as elliptical galaxies .
The " ancestors " of galaxies like our own remained elusive .
Lyman alpha-emitting galaxies , breeding grounds for new stars
While he was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University , Eric Gawiser embarked on a search for the ancient precursors of Milky Way - type spirals .
His colleague Caryl Gronwall , from Penn State University , worked on characterising the distinictive Lyman alpha-emitting galaxies .
The researchers used a combination of computer simulations and cosmological theory to predict how these galaxies would evolve .
" This determined that the typical present - day descendent of the galaxies we identified is a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way , " said Eric Gawiser , now a professor of astronomy at Rutgers University in New Jersey .
The research was carried out using the Blanco 4 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory in Chile , the Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory , also in Chile , and Nasa 's Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes .
But it appears that not all galaxies grow through mergers .
In other findings released at the meeting , astronomers report that a class of massive , disc galaxies that existed in the early Universe must have formed from a massive gas cloud collapsing in on itself .

( AP ) FRANKFORT , Ind . - Paul Brant considers himself a penny pincher , but his savings in quarters and dollar coins really paid off .
Brant , 70 , used more than $ 25,000 in change to help buy a new Dodge Ram half - ton pickup truck Friday _ 13 years after buying another truck with spare change .
" ( The old truck ) did n’t have four - wheel drive , and living in the country , I figured I better get a new one to help get me through the snow , " he said .
Brant said he was raised to be thrifty .
His father always paid in cash and saved up loose change to take vacations .
Brant has been storing his change for years , and estimated he had about $ 26,000 in coins for Friday ’s purchase .
In 1994 , he bought a Dodge pickup and a Dodge Neon using about $ 36,000 in quarters .
" As long as you do n’t put your hands back in the till , it really adds up , " he said .
Brant stored his change in coffee cans , water jugs and piggy banks over the years , and was escorted by sheriff ’s deputies as he brought the rolled coins to the dealership .
A Mike Raisor Chrysler Dodge and Jeep employee who sold Brant the truck said the dealership called in an armored car to count and handle the coins .
" No bank wants to take them , " Keith Gephart said .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ The Golden Compass , ” a costly fantasy starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig , got off to a slow start at the North American box office and will likely fall short of opening - weekend expectations .

New Line Cinema's $ 180 million film sold an estimated $ 8.8 million worth of tickets during its first day in theaters on Friday , according to data issued on Saturday by tracking firm Box Office Mojo ( www.boxofficemojo.com).
After Saturday and Sunday sales are factored in , the film will come in at No. 1 with about $ 28 million when the studios issue their weekend estimates on Sunday , said Paul Dergarabedian at Media By Numbers , another tracking firm .
New Line , a struggling Time Warner Inc unit hoping to launch another franchise along the lines of its blockbuster “ Lord of the Rings ” series , said last week it was hoping the film would open to between $ 30 million and $ 40 million .
“ It ’s below expectations , but it ’s not an out - and - out debacle , ” said Dergarabedian .
Conspiring against the movie , he said , were such factors as a soft marketplace and unrealistic expectations for an epic fantasy filling the holiday void left by the “ Narnia ” and “ Lord of the Rings ” smashes .
A New Line executive did not return a call seeking comment .
Based on the first book in British author Philip Pullman ’s acclaimed children ’s series “ His Dark Materials , ” writer / director Chris Weitz ’s film is set in an alternate world ruled by an oppressive religious authority .
It features talking animals and a heroine played by youngster Dakota Blue Richards .
Even though the film downplays the religious aspect , it has been savaged by such groups as the Catholic League and the U.S. Conference of Bishops .
Opponents have cited Pullman ’s unflattering portrayal of the church and specifically the Catholic faith .
Critics were also generally negative on the film , according to the web site Rotten Tomatoes ( www.rottentomatoes.com), which collates reviews .
The film represents another disappointment for Kidman , who had yet to headline a live - action $ 100 million movie .
Her most recent successes were 2005 ’s “ The Interpreter ” ( $ 72 million ) and 2003 ’s “ Cold Mountain ” ( $ 96 million ) .
She and Craig co-starred in the summer release “ The Invasion , ” which flopped with just $ 15 million .
Craig had better luck reviving the James Bond franchise last year with “ Casino Royale ” ( $ 167 million ) .
New Line has also struggled .
Its biggest movie of 2007 , “ Rush Hour 3 ” ( $ 140 million ) , earned less than half of its predecessor .
Other films , such as Jim Carrey ’s “ The Number 23 ” and the wartime drama “ Rendition ” quickly came and went .
The last month in China has seen a range of reactions to the rescue of several hundred slaves , including children , from Chinese brickyards .
In the cities there was shock ; in the villages , where the victims came from , people knew that kidnapping is neither a new nor an isolated phenomenon .
In the government , there was embarrassment : the existence of slavery cast something of a shadow over the party 's current promise of a " harmonious society " .
There was another , more unexpected result : the Southern Metropolis Weekly published an interview with the writer Wu Si , who argued cogently that both local tyranny and slavery had a long history in China , and that neither would be eliminated without democracy and the rule of law .
His argument was simple : historically these things happened because the good behaviour of officials had depended on the vigilance of their superiors .
Today , he said , the core power structure remained unchanged .
" It is , " he said , " still an upwardly responsible pyramid . "
Just as in the Qing dynasty , slavery is illegal today , but the law is not just insufficiently specific , as the national lawyers ' association pointed out this week , it is also ignored .
And just as in the Qing dynasty , senior officials complained that subordinates took bribes to flout the law , lied to superiors and resorted to obfuscation and delay if ordered to enforce it .
Many village heads are now elected in China , but , as Wu pointed out , the more powerful figure of the party secretary is not .
" Democracy may not solve this problem , " he said , " but a lack of democracy has caused it ... throw the crooks out by casting votes .
And separation of powers , too , so that one individual can no longer mislead the public .
An independent disciplinary department , an independent judiciary , an independent legislature . "
It is a measure of the government 's wider problem of legitimacy that the Southern Metropolitan Weekly has not yet been closed down for heresy against the Communist party .
Indeed , as the party prepares for its 17th congress this autumn , the word democracy is on the lips of the party elite ; the difficulty is to determine what they mean by it .
Two years ago , the Chinese government published a white paper on democracy that opened with the stirring proposition that " democracy is an outcome of the development of political civilisation of mankind .
It is also the common desire of people all over the world " .
Earlier this year the prime minister , Wen Jiabao , announced that " democracy , law , freedom and human rights " were not exclusive to capitalism .
But the white paper went on to explain that " democracy with Chinese characteristics " had been the party 's gift to the Chinese people and there is little sign that this has changed .
On June 25 , Hu Jintao , the party general secretary , told an audience at the Party School , the communists ' most important thinktank , that " greater participation " by the people was desirable - as long as it did not jeopardise the party 's rule .
In Hu's view , wider consultation and a slightly wider franchise within the party for senior posts should just about do it .
" Chinese characteristics " seem set to remain firmly in force .
But this is unlikely to satisfy the demands of a population that has seen the promise of prosperity falter as the wealth gap widens and the rich and powerful pillage the public good .
Outside party circles , the democracy discussion is much more radical .
Nearly 25 years ago , Wei Jingsheng , an electrician from Beijing Zoo , shot to fame with his famous wall poster , the Fifth Modernisation , pasted on that briefly tolerated bulletin board of political debate , Democracy Wall .
It was an open challenge to Deng Xiaoping , whose " four modernisations " announced his intention to liberalise China 's socialist economy .
When Wei argued that China would not be a modern country if it did not also modernise its political system , he paid for his temerity with many years in jail .
Twenty - five years on , his argument is gaining ground .
Last year a conference paper called for the party to split into two factions and contest elections .
The author of that paper escaped sanctions .
The party 's conservative approach is unlikely to silence the growing number of voices who , like Wu , point out that the ills that afflict the legitimacy of party rule - corruption , arbitrary local tyranny and a legal system that remains firmly under the thumb of the powerful - are unlikely to be fixed from above .
Authoritarian , top - down systems do not allow information to reach the head of the dinosaur with the speed required to allow leadership to run an effective government , as the Qing emperors discovered .
And even when news gets out , local officials are aware , as they always have been , that the emperor is far away .
The difference is that increasing numbers of citizens know better .
They are organising themselves into a bewildering range of pressure groups and action committees , despite restrictions on civic organisation , learning how to take action and pressure officials to obey the law of the land .
In a growing number of articles , writers and intellectuals are challenging the proposition that the party has a divine right to the monopoly of political power - and the government no longer feels able to silence them .

Police were today quizzing two teenagers on suspicion of murder after the charred body of a man was found in the embers of a bonfire .
The body of Stephen Croft , 34 , was discovered by firefighters in Wirral , Merseyside , after a member of the public reported the Guy Fawkes Night blaze .
As crews arrived to extinguish the bonfire , on grassland at the junction of Borough Road and Whetstone Lane in Birkenhead , his body was found in the embers .
He had suffered head injuries and severe burns .
A 13 - year - old boy was arrested this morning and remains in custody for questioning .
Police said tonight a 19 - year - old man has also been arrested .
Detectives were investigating reports that Croft was beaten - up and pushed onto the fire in scenes recorded on mobile phone cameras .
The grim find of his blackened remains was made hours after an officially organised fire , attended by more than 100 people , at a YMCA centre on Merseyside .
Residents said he had been attacked by youths who re-started the bonfire after the event on spare ground near the YMCA in Whetstone Lane , Birkenhead .
One witness said that three teenagers were jeering at the man and had recorded footage of them throwing a burning log at him in a ' happy - slapping ' assault .
The man 's badly burned body was discovered by a security guard from the YMCA centre when the alarm was raised by one teenager in the early hours of yesterday morning .
Police sealed - off the area and where conducting forensic tests and door - to - door inquiries in the area near Birkenhad town centre .
Stephen , known locally as " Chezza " , lived locally and was a devoted Everton fan .
Student Chris Jones , 18 , described the victim as a happy man who always wore an Everton shirt .
He said : " Chezza was a happy soul and was well known in the community .
" He loved footy and it 's very sad what happened to him .
" I saw three lads , aged about 14 , talking to him as he sat on his own near the bonfire .
" They were jeering him and an argument broke out , then they threw a burning log at him and recorded it on their mobiles . "
A YMCA spokeswoman said : " The centre organised the bonfire and it was a success with a good turnout .
" Everyone had a really good time and the fire was put out shortly after 10 pm .
" It was fairly quiet for the next few hours - but one of our security guards ran in to raise the alarm when he found a body on the bonfire .
" It 's terrible to think that such a happy night could end in tragedy . "
A Home Office post - mortem will be carried out today to determine exactly what injuries killed the victim .
A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said : " The man 's body had suffered severe burns and the post mortem was therefore expected to be complex .
" What the fire service saw was horrific .
" Head injuries the deceased sustained indicate he may have been subjected to some kind of assault before his death .
" A thirteen year old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder but that is not to say that he will be charged with that offence .
" We need to build up a picture of what has lead to this death , and we ask anyone who was in the Whetstone Lane area at the time of the attack to come forward .

FOR Whitney Hess , a 25 - year - old software designer in Manhattan , the tension that ultimately ended her recent relationships was all right there , in the digits on her pay stub .
The awkwardness started with nights out .
She would want to try the latest downtown bistro , but her boyfriends , who worked in creative jobs that paid less than hers , preferred diners .
They would say , “ Wow , you ’re so sophisticated , ” she recalled .
A first look at her apartment , a smartly appointed studio in a full - service building in TriBeCa , would only reinforce the impression .
“ They would n’t want me to see their apartments , ” she said , because they lived in cramped surroundings in distant quadrants of Brooklyn or the Bronx .
One of them , she said , finally just came out and said it .
“ Look , ” Ms. Hess recalled him saying , “ it makes me really uncomfortable that you make more money than me .
I ’m going to put that out on the table and try to get over it . ”

Dr Rosenthal , the director of the university 's cognitive behavioural research and treatment program , said many drug addicts continued to suffer despite receiving the best known treatments .
" As part of six months of counselling , during 12 sessions , the counsellor uses virtual reality to help the patient learn to confront cravings directly in a simulated world full of crack cocaine related cues , " he said in an interview .
" When the cravings go up and no crack is smoked , after several minutes the cravings then go down .
Once they go down we play a tone over and over again to the patient .
This tone becomes conditioned to the experience of learning that the patient can have cravings , but not use . "
Mobile phone software is then given to patients so they can hear the tone and provide feedback on their cravings 24 hours a day .
As a result of the virtual Pavlovian conditioning , the patient should eventually associate Dr Rosenthal 's tone with the sensation of decreased craving .
The goal is for patients to be able to control the cravings even when in high - risk environments .
Using virtual worlds for medical purposes has already proven successful for Australia 's Inspire foundation , which launched an online role - playing game in September , designed to help young people overcome mental health problems .
The game , Reach Out Central , was last week announced as the joint winner of the global " Why Games Matter : A Prescription for Improving Health and Health Care " competition , which looked at ways video games were transforming health care .
Made using virtual reality software called VR Worlds 2 , Dr Rosenthal 's cyber crack house could easily be mistaken for a video game .
And for good reason , since it 's based on the same gaming engine used for the first - person shooter classic Half - Life 2 .
Therapists are able to customise the virtual environment to suit individual patients , but the ultimate goal is to elicit cravings and then to eliminate them .
Patients can be taken to locations including an abandoned crack house , apartment , motel , alley , restaurant / bar , middle class home and park .
" Starting with low cravings , the therapist guides the patient over time to increasingly more intense people , places and things , " Dr Rosenthal said .
" At the most intense level , patients may see multiple people buying , selling and using crack inside an apartment together . "
While the study is ongoing , Dr Rosenthal said patients had told him the virtual world was highly realistic and effective at reducing cravings .
Several asked if they could keep calling in from their mobile phones to hear the tone after they left the program .
" If our data show that this approach is successful ... then I imagine we will have some interest in testing how to implement this treatment in the real world of community treatment programs in America , Australia and beyond , " he said .
While reading Planet Gnome , I read a good post by Clare So discussing programming suggestions for CS students .
I thought it was a particularly good read , and would like to also discuss it here .
The inspiration for his post , and mine as well , comes from a list of suggestions found on Google ( that link is in Chinese , so to see a translated version in English , click here ( I hope you will apologize my slaughtering the translation on points 3 & 6 . Maybe someone can suggest a better translation ? ) ) .
1. Practice the fundamentals .
Do n't spend all your efforts on popular languages and tools , and the skills listed in the job advertisements .
Instead , master your skills in statistics , computing , databases , operating systems , computer architecture , computer networks and discrete mathematics .
Try to solve problems in Donald Knuth 's " Art of Programming " .
If you can solve most of the problems , your skills in computing are not bad .
2 . Seek more challenges .
Experience in programming can reinforce your knowledge .
Try to accumulate the experience of writing 100,000 lines of code when you are in your 4th year .
3 . Practice , practice , practice .
Do not underestimate any of the actual work , such as seemingly simple coding or testing .
You will gain professional experience pursuing and paying attention to the details of the code .
4 . Do n't forget about mathematics .
Math is gymnastics to your brain .
Math is everywhere .
If you are particularly interested in math - intensive tasks , such as video and image processing , you will need these skills as your tools .
5 . Develop a team spirit and to learn how to work well with others .
6 . Encourage innovation , and do n't necessarily stick to the authors code in the books .
7 . Work strategically .
Try to find meaningful and interesting summer job or part - time job if it does not affect you schoolwork .
Go find a place that pays attention to programming .
Working with a good boss , your code will be used by clients .
Do n't rush to become a boss .
Your goal must be to learn from other people .
When you are working or finding a job , do n't only look at benefits and the job title .
Pick an environment that encourages learning , a company that is willing to train employees , and a company that regards you as an important person .
Last , but not least , pick a good boss .
This is good advice .
If I may , I 'd like to expound a bit on a couple of them .
Seek More Challenges : Writing 100,000 lines of code by your 4th year of college is an impressive feat by any standards .
Even if all that code is spread across a number of different languages during your college career .
However , you 're not going to hit that level just doing your homework in the CS department .
You need to code on projects or just for fun outside of school , and you need to find the time to do it .
There 's more to just reaching 100,000 lines , though .
It 's about discipline .
It 's about learning fundamentals .
It 's about finding the very difficult scenarios , and how to solve them .
Ultimately , writing 100,000 lines of code before you even graduate , is about experience .
You will be properly molded as a programmer and developer .
The # 1 challenge that students face , however , is finding what to code .
How do you just sit down at your computer , and start coding ?
You need a project , or a problem to solve .
You need something that will keep you motivated to write the problem .
www.pythonchallenge.com is a perfect fit .
Each page on the site presents you with a problem .
You code the challenge in the Python programming language and modify the URL with the answer , moving on to the next challenge .
Although it 's a far cry from writing 100,000 lines of code , it 's a good challenge that will stretch your mind , and get you coding .
There are many other examples and challenges online to get you coding .
Do n't forget about mathematics : Coming from a Mathematics major , I can back this point up until the cows come home .
Programming and software development require a great deal of logically thinking through problems .
Just the other day , a friend of mine and I were discussing technical questions that are asked in software development interviews .
Usually , they are fairly nasty , going back to the fundamentals that you learned while in college , or studying .
However , most of the problems presented , if they 're a good interviewer , are logic - based , and this is where your skill as a mathematician will shine .
For example , one question in just such an interview could be " Here is an array of randomly placed integers .
Write a program that sorts the array . "
While your skill as a programmer will shine , your skill as a mathematician will shine brighter .
Even if the syntax is bad , and would not compile , the logical thought process behind the algorithm is what the interviewer will be looking for .
I 've heard complaints from students year - round that what they are learning in math class , they will never use in their career , or in real life .
My rebuttal has always been that they are further from the truth than they realize .
By learning the math skills that they are , even if it is differential equations or triple integrals , they are honing their skill in logic .
Being able to sit down , and workout even the most insane and unrealistic math problems means that you are able to think through a problem , and come up with a solution , going from one step to the other .
If you can do this without a well - formulated equation sitting in front of you in black and white on textbook paper , then you are skilled indeed .
Learn math .
Finally , work strategically :
When looking for a computer programming or software development job , as the tip suggests , look for a job that encourages growth and an employer that is willing to train your , increasing your skill and potential .
There are good programming jobs and there are bad ones .
The bad jobs will put you in tasks that are mundane , and do n't stretch your imagination .
The same thing over and over .
Initially , there may be a learning curve when hired learning the task , but after several repetitions , day after day , the learning curve levels and the job becomes boring and mundane .
So , you want to pick a job that takes you from the mundane to the exciting .
The only jobs that encourage this culture are jobs that encourage growth and learning .
For example , at my current job at introPLAY , I recognize , as well as my boss , that my Python skills are very new and unexperienced .
While I was hired for my frontend skills in HTML , CSS and JavaScript , the company I work for fosters the training and learning that is necessary for me to learn Python and help progress the speed of development for the company .
Even more so , as is with most web development positions , new problems present itself daily , and I am constantly battling how to tackle the problem at hand .
This mental stretching and learning is a great work environment .
So there you have it .
Some great advice for CS students looking to get into the field .
To be honest , I wish I would 've known some of these tips when I was attending school .
In fact , I wish some of the faculty would 've taken the time to go over these as well .
These tips are pearls of great worth , and if taken seriously , will propel your development career far and fast .
Even Patrick Ruffini is impressed :
Ron Paul will place second at Ames .
You heard it here first .
He leads the second tier in cash - on - hand .
He was able to get 1,200 people out to the Hy - Vee ( has any candidate done something that big on their own , not at an RPI event ? ) .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Credit rating company Moody ’s Investors Service on Thursday said it raised its assumptions for losses on loans backing subprime mortgages as much as 85 percent in response to deteriorating performance .
Average losses for loans made in 2006 -- as underwriting standards were loosened more -- will likely fall between 12 percent and 24 percent , depending on variables such as house price depreciation and the impact of rising payments on adjustable - rate loans , Moody ’s said .
Moody ’s projection for losses in 2006 subprime loans ranges between 14 percent and 18 percent , between the extremes .
In October , Moody ’s projected losses would fall between 6.5 percent and 15 percent .
“ We see delinquencies still going up , not having reached a plateau , ” Moody ’s Chief Credit Officer Nicolas Weill said .
“ There are also more concerns by the Moody ’s economists on the potential for higher unemployment and recession ” and home price declines , he added .
The revised estimates will likely result in more negative ratings actions on 2006 subprime RMBS .
Habeas Corpus has been suspended and most of the protections of the Bill of Rights have been set aside by a President who regards the Constitution of the United States as " just a goddam piece of paper . "
After six years of Congressional subservience to the President that a Soviet dictator would envy , in 2006 the American public voted to put the " opposition party " in control of the Congress , with a public demand that this party end the Iraq war , restore the rights of the citizens and the rule of law , and hold the ruling junta accountable for its crimes .
After almost a year in power , the Congress has done none of these : the " opposition party " has simply refused to oppose .
This country 's mass media , most of which is owned by six conglomerates , serves the administration and the corporate elites -- elites that finance both political parties and which benefit from the tax breaks , deregulation , and war contracts obediently facilitated by the Congress .
This media serves up the public with an endless diet of trivia and drivel .
Opposition candidates and dissenters , if they are given any attention at all , are slandered , while detrimental facts and commentary about the President and his supporters are rarely reported .
To be sure , the embargo on criticism of the regime is not complete .
A few occasional critics are heard in the mainstream , and a few independent small - circulation magazines publish sharp dissents without hindrance .
Nonetheless , the delinquency of the mainstream media is proven by the significant stories that never see print or air time : among them , the Downing Street Memos which prove that the President lied when he told the nation that he did not seek war in Iraq ; irrefutable proof that the President walked away from his military obligation ; compelling evidence that the past presidential elections were stolen ; dissent by serving military officers and enlisted personnel ; photographs and TV footage of dead and gravely injured soldiers in Iraq .
The list is long .
To their great credit , most of the American people have at last seen through and dismissed the establishment propaganda in the mainstream media .
While a majority of the public believed at first the administration lies that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was involved in the attacks of 9/11 , today only a minority still believe this .
Immediately after 9/11 , more than 90 % of the public approved of the President 's performance in office .
Now that approval is at an unprecedented low of 24 % , and a mere eleven percent approve of the Congress .
Small wonder : while nearly three - quarters of the population wishes to see an end to the Iraq war and occupation , the Congress , contrary to the wishes of the public , continues to fund it .
Failing to find reliable information in the mainstream media , more and more Americans are turning to the Internet , the remaining source of unfiltered information and unconstrained political commentary .
Discerning " surfers " are well aware that the vast majority of internet sites are worthless : pornography , hucksters , undisciplined and uninformed rants , etc .
However , a small minority of websites are invaluable  the last refuge of dissent .
While they last .
( The foregoing is merely a sketch of the crisis facing the American people , and thus is grossly oversimplified .
I have written several essays , and The Crisis Papers has listed numerous articles , detailing these abuses by the Bush Administration and the current political crisis in the United States .
My purpose is simply to reiterate this crisis rather than to make the case anew .
The primary task of this essay , an appeal for help from the international community , follows ) .
And so today there are , in effect , two Americas : first , the " official " United States comprising the Bush / Cheney administration , the mainstream media , both political parties , and the corporate elites that both support and benefit from this political establishment .
Add to these the quarter of the population that persists in the belief that this political / corporate establishment is legitimate and serves the public interest .
The second America , consisting of as much as two - thirds of the population includes the dissenting " subjects " of the political establishment .
This public is acted upon , but is powerless to act .
It demands an end to the Iraq disaster .
It demands health care reform .
This public demands fiscal responsibility and a fair tax burden .
All to no avail .
The public also demands fair and verifiable elections .
Majorities go to the polls and vote to " throw the rascals out . "
Nonetheless , " black - box " paperless voting machines reverse the public will and keep the rascals in .
In short , as I said at the outset , the government of the United States no longer rules " with the consent of the governed . "
For all practical purposes , the Constitution of the United States , which every federal official and every member of Congress takes an oath " to protect and defend , " is no longer the supreme law of the land .
" The unitary executive " rules supreme .
Acts of Congress that the President does n't like are nullified with " signing statements . "
Subpoenas from Congress demanding accountability of administration officials are ignored as the Congress meekly submits to this unlawful abuse of executive power .
The illegal Iraq occupation continues .
Congress 's ultimate retaliation , impeachment , remains permanently " off the table . "
And Congress is deaf to the protests of the public .
If we the people of the United States are to take back our government , we will need all the help that we can get .
And this might include help from abroad .
Most emphatically , I do n't mean military help .
God forbid !
If a foreign army approaches our shores , like the Iraqi " insurgents " I will ally myself with our hated regime to throw off the invaders .
Military intervention invites slaughter , and must be avoided at all costs .
The message that there are " two Americas " -- the " official " usurping oligarchy and the majority public " yearning to breath free "  must be repeated , loud and clear , before the entire world .
Four years ago , millions filled the streets throughout the world to protest the pending Iraq war .
And time and again we hear from abroad , " we do n't hate Americans , we hate your government . "
This international sentiment must be directed toward governments abroad so that they might , in turn , act in defiance of the American government and in support of the disenfranchised American public .
That 's how we treated the so - called " captive peoples " behind the " iron curtain " during the Cold War .
It worked then , and it can work again .
Here are a few suggestions : Provide political asylum .
The Congress has authorized the administration to proclaim martial law , virtually at the President 's own say - so .
So if some undefined " national emergency " takes place , any and all conspicuous dissenters are in immediate peril .
The internment camps are reported to be in place and empty , awaiting their unfortunate residents .
Dissenters will be emboldened if they know that , in the worst case , they will not be trapped in their own country , and that there will be refuge beyond the borders .
Are you listening , Canada ?
Mexico ? Costa Rica ?
Radio Free America .
( Or , " The Voice TO America " ) .
The Cold War supplies a precedent .
If the corporate mass media will not provide the American public with accurate and unbiased national and world news , then perhaps the foreign media might serve this purpose .
The Guardian of the United Kingdom is doing so splendidly with its American edition .
The BBC news , which is available on TV cable and satellite , and the CBC , which can be accessed close to the Canadian border , understandably broadcast news about their own respective countries .
Expanded coverage of news of special interest to American audiences would be much appreciated .
The US government might protest .
But official Soviet protests did not silence Radio Free Europe or The Voice of America .
It remains to be seen how well the Brits and Canadians would serve the American " liberation movement . "
The Free Internet .
Clearly the internet  " the American Samizdat "  is the primary holdout against the Bushevik " Ministry of Truth . "
Indeed , given its significance as a source of dissent , it is a mystery why the free internet has not yet been shut down or at least severely curtailed by the establishment .
And in fact , there are increasing indications that this curtailment is imminent .
If the media corporations that provide the internet servers are afforded the " right " to select internet content , then that will surely cripple the dissenting internet .
But it need not kill it .
As the Chinese and Soviet governments discovered in the eighties , the international communication networks have become too vast and indispensable for even totalitarian governments to control .
The Tiananmen protests , the Polish Solidarity movement were coordinated by FAX and international telecommunications .
In the Russian counter - revolution of 1991 , the internet emerged as a significant instrument of dissent .
Today , the international communications network is too indispensable to both the US and the the global economies to be set aside simply to accommodate the political needs of the ruling American elites .
The domestic American internet , crushed to earth will rise again .
Economic Levers .
The whole world knows what the Bushevik elites refuse to acknowledge : those American corporate elites , in their unconstrained greed , have sold - off the American industrial economy , which is now " owned " by our creditors and by the suppliers ( primarily Asian ) of our manufactured goods .
True , the United States expenditure on its military is equal to that of all other nations combined .
But the result is that multi-billion dollar aircraft , carriers , submarines , and missiles , are useless against " insurgents " with improvised weapons in Iraq .
And we have the absurdity of missiles aimed at China , with guidance systems containing microprocessors made in China .
Bottom line : the US military budget contributes , not to our strength , but to our weakness .
For all this military hardware is totally irrelevant to the fact that the American economy is at the mercy of our creditors and the suppliers of our essential resources  our foreign creditors and suppliers .
As Bush and Cheney continue their brutal repression of Iraq , as they rattle their swords at Iran , and as they flagrantly violate international laws against torture and aggressive war , they are increasingly perceived as threats against global peace and security .
The " coalition of the willing " is fast becoming the " coalition of the fed - up . "
And this " the coalition of the fed - up " is not helpless against the threat of this emerging , self - proclaimed " benevolent global hegemony , " and its " new world order "  this " new American Century . "
If , as is becoming increasingly likely , the United States is perceived abroad at the primary threat to global peace and security , the international community can , by threatening to devalue the dollar , call in the US debts , and curtail imports of essential resources , exert enormous pressure on the American government .
As William Greider wisely observers , " any profligate debtor who insults his banker is unwise , to put it mildly . "
The " coalition of the fed - up " has , as its natural ally , the disenfranchised " second America . "
Both desire the dissolution of the American corporatocracy , the end of the neo-con " Project for the New American Century , " and the return of a restored American democracy to the community of nations .
Surely this is an incomplete list of how the disenfranchised and powerless American majority might , with the assistance of free peoples abroad , bring about a restoration of a government , of , by , and for the people , to the United States .

I received the following puzzle in e-mail :
( The animation starts after ten seconds . )
At the start , there are twelve men in the image .
After the two sections change places , there are thirteen men .
The puzzle is figuring out where the thirteenth man came from .
To understand where the extra man comes from , try playing with the following two Flash applets .
Mr al - Rawi has lived in the UK for nearly 20 years
Bisher al - Rawi , an Iraqi national , was held at the US detention camp in Cuba on suspicion of links to terrorism while on a trip to Gambia in 2002 .
In a statement Mr Rawi , a businessman from south - west London , said : " I am delighted to be back home in England , with my family . "
He added : " My nightmare is finally at an end . "
I also feel great sorrow for the other nine British residents who remain prisoners in Guantanamo Bay
Bisher al - Rawi
On Thursday , Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said it had been agreed with the US authorities that he would be returned to the UK , but officials have not disclosed precisely when the detainee was freed .
" As happy as I am to be home though , leaving my best friend Jamil al - Banna behind in Guantanamo Bay makes my freedom bittersweet , " Mr Rawi said in a statement released through the law firm Reprieve .
" Jamil was arrested with me in the Gambia on exactly the same unfounded allegations , yet he is still a prisoner .
" I also feel great sorrow for the other nine British residents who remain prisoners in Guantanamo Bay .
' Misinformation '
" The extreme isolation they are going through is one of the most profoundly difficult things to endure .
I know that all too well . "
Mr Rawi also paid tribute to all those who campaigned for his release .
His lawyer , Zachary Katznelson , gave further details on why Mr Rawi was originally arrested .
He said a " suspicious device " was found in his client 's luggage but added that it turned out to be a battery charger .
Mr Katznelson added : " So it was misinformation that started this chain of events , though unfortunately that led to him first being taken by the CIA to Afghanistan to an underground prison of 24 hour darkness with rats everywhere , to then being taken to Guantanamo - and it took years to right this wrong . "
He accused the American authorities of treating Mr Rawi with " brutality " .
Mr Katznelson went on : " Right to the end they treated him with brutality , on the way to the plane in Guantanamo - they knew he was leaving - they insisted still on shackling him , blindfolding him , putting on earmuffs so he could n't hear a thing and keeping him in the back of a very hot , very confined van on the way to the plane . "
However the lawyer praised the way the British authorities treated his client after the handover .
False dawns
His constituency MP , Lib Dem Edward Davey , described the news as " fantastic " .
He said : " There were many , many months of despair punctured by a few false dawns .
" Yet the sense that a huge injustice was being done kept the family and the team of campaigners together . "
Mr Davey said the government must ask British officials in the US to negotiate for the return of other UK residents in the US detention camp .
Meanwhile , Sarah Teather , Mr Banna 's MP , said Britain had a moral duty to get her constituent home .
Secret police
British officials have long refused to represent resident foreigners held at Guantanamo , but took up Mr Rawi 's case after it was disclosed he had previously co-operated with MI5 .
Mr Rawi , an Iraqi citizen with UK residency , was reportedly sent to England in 1985 after his father was arrested by Saddam Hussein 's secret police .
Mr Banna is a Jordanian refugee who had been living in north - west London .
Both men were alleged to have been associated with al - Qaeda through their connection with the London - based radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada .
Mr Rawi and Mr Banna have denied any involvement with Islamic terrorism .
Do Political Parties Matter ?
That ’s the question asked by the Wharton economists Fernando Ferreira and Joseph Gyourko .
But they are not talking about national political parties .
In that realm , party affiliation has indeed been shown to have a strong effect on legislation and policy .
No , Ferreira and Gyourko are interested in whether party affiliation matters on the local level — and their answer , essentially , is no .
Using data from more than 4,500 U.S. mayoral elections between 1950 and 2005 in more than 400 cities with populations of at least 25,000 , here is what they learned :
[ W]e find that party labels do not affect the size of government , the allocation of spending or crime rates , even though there is a large political advantage to incumbency in terms of the probability of winning the next election …
In particular , there is a relatively high degree of household homogeneity at the local level that appears to provide the proper incentives for local politicians to be able to credibly commit to moderation and discourages strategic extremism .
While few people would accuse Rudy Giuliani of having “ commit[ted ] to moderation ” or avoiding “ strategic extremism ” when he was mayor of New York City , the fact remains that he was the rare Republican elected by an extraordinarily Democratic town , and he was generally well regarded until close to the end of his second term .
By then , it was mainly his temperament and personal affairs that had turned off many swing voters .
It is true that the mayor of New York City has a larger budget and set of responsibilities than the governors of some states ; still , he is the lone mayor running in this year ’s presidential election , and is leading the way at that .
It will be interesting to see if and how Giuliani , running against a pack of men and a woman who have long been faithful to their national party , assumes the true stripes of his Republican affiliation .

The Voice of Beslan group has been charged with " extremism " over an appeal to politicians in Europe and the US which implied that Putin assisted terrorists .
The prosecution was launched under legislation introduced last year which civil rights activists warned could be used to attack critics of the Kremlin .
More than 1,000 people were taken hostage during the siege in 2004 , when militants seized a school in Beslan , North Ossetia , a region bordering Chechnya .
The three - day stand - off with security forces ended in a bloodbath when two explosions destroyed part of the school gymnasium and provoked a gun battle .
A total of 334 people died , more than half of them children .
No senior official was put on trial , despite numerous witnesses testifying that the rescue attempt was a shambles .
An investigation by federal MPs found the militants were at fault for all the deaths .
Relatives of the dead and some local politicians insist security forces fired on the gymnasium before it was fully evacuated .
The Voice of Beslan said in its release that Putin was " a president who solves his problems with tanks and flame - throwers " .
He had become a " guarantor for criminals " , it added .
Prosecutors , who claimed they found the appeal during routine monitoring of the internet , said the accusations were unlawful .
Voice of Beslan has led a campaign to get security service officials charged over the siege .
Last year members of the group erected a sign pointing at the ruins of the Beslan school reading " Putin's Course " .
Emma Tagaeva , the chairman of Voice of Beslan , described the prosecution as " an order from Moscow " , in revenge for the group 's struggle for justice .
In a letter to Putin asking him to halt today 's prosecution , she wrote : " We consider you guilty of the deaths of our children but does that represent a manifestation of extremism ?
Will it bring honour to the law enforcement organs to accuse the victims of a terrible tragedy of extremism ? "
Human rights activists have spoken out against the trial .
Lyudmila Alekseeva , head of the Moscow Helsinki Group , said : " This is all happening because Voice of Beslan is making every effort so that the investigation into the deaths of such a huge number of children and adults does n't go quiet .
That 's why the might of the state , the court system and administrative methods are being used to battle against these unfortunate women who lost their children . "
The law was amended in 2006 to expand the definition of extremist activity to include public slander of a government official while performing his duties .
Critics said the changes would be used by the Kremlin to silence opponents .
Under Russian law a person who publishes extremist literature can be jailed for up to three years .
Lev Ponomaryov , head of the For Human Rights movement , said : " If this approach to the problem of extremism is taken , then every opposition figure in Russia could be charged . "
After years of struggle , the Cape Wind project has come one giant step closer to approval today .
Cape Wind passed a major milestone today at the start of its final year of permitting with the release of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement ( DEIS ) from the lead Federal permitting agency , the Minerals management Service ( MMS ) of the Department of Interior .
From the MMS DEIS :
* Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound is environmentally and economically superior to the alternative sites that were studied .
* Cape Wind will reduce regional emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) by 880,000 tons per year .
CO2 is a greenhouse gas that causes climate change .
* Cape Wind will reduce regional air pollution emissions such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that harm human health .
* Cape Wind will create hundreds of jobs .
* Cape Wind will provide a needed supply of electricity and improve electric diversification and reliability .
* Cape Wind will go a long way toward Massachusetts being able to achieve its renewable energy requirements under the Stateâ€™s Renewable Portfolio Standard .
* Cape Wind will not have major impacts on birds , fish , marine mammals , fishing , tourism , or on sea or air navigation .
That last one is especially important , as it was a major source of outright lies by the opposition .
This project has been studied up one side and down the other , and its nice to see some people in charge finally realize just how good it will be for the area .
â€ œWith news of $ 100 / barrel oil , urgent calls from scientists to take action on climate change and with the publicâ€™s desire for greater energy independence and new jobs , this report couldnâ€™t come at a more important moment , â€ Cape Wind President Jim Gordon said .
â€ œThe release of this report will move Cape Wind forward and help establish Massachusetts as a world leader in offshore renewable energy , â€ Gordon continued .
This MMS DEIS comes three years after the former Federal lead reviewing agency , the US Army Corps of Engineers issued their comprehensive review of Cape Wind that found significant public benefits and few negative impacts .
In 2005 , the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approved Cape Windâ€™s application after a 33 - month (! ) review finding the project would provide needed power , reduce energy costs by $ 25 million dollars per year and provide significant air quality benefits for New England .
In his March 2007 Certificate , Massachusetts Secretary of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs Ian Bowles said of Cape Wind : â€ œOverall , the project represents a balanced and thoughtful commitment to action that will contribute to the long - term preservation and enhancement of our environment.â€ 
Cape Wind encourages the public and interested stakeholders to participate in the 60 - day public comment period by sending written comments to the MMS and by speaking at the four public hearings in March .
The MMS has previously stated they expect to issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement and to issue a Record of Decision on Cape Wind later this year .
With the price of oil , the dangers of global warming , and now the umpteenth million agency giving it approval I just do n’t see what anyone would have against this project .
Oh yea now I remember , a couple rich people might on some clear days actually be able to see tiny little wind turbines off in the distance .
Well here ’s an idea rich people , suck it up !
If you want your ocean front mansions that use super amounts of energy , and want your private jets , and want your big hummers , and to buy new cloths every season , well guess what its time to pay your dues .
You will have to deal with tiny little toothpick sized white sticks on the horizon .
Boo freaking hoo .
We can only hope that Ted “ but thats where I sail my yacht ” Kennedy does n’t decide that some other random US regulatory agency should spend another seven years looking at this project .
Note :
This article can be considered a sequel for An IE Lover ’s Guide to Firefox , which described Firefox through the eyes of an Internet Explorer fan .
Similarly , this article describes Opera ’s features from the point of view of a user – myself – who has been using Firefox for years and is now considering another browser switch .
I am a Firefox fan .
I ’ve been using Firefox since it was named “ Firebird ” and calling it “ stable ” was a big overstatement .
Firefox dragged me out of Internet Explorer , and that was definitely one of its biggest achievements .
Because I ’m addicted to trying out new tools , however , I always kept testing new browsers I discovered here and there .
K- Meleon , Flock , Sleipnir …
When Safari came out for Windows I immediately installed it and used it for about 2 hours , only to realize that it was n’t – and it still is n’t – usable at all , mainly due to sporadic crashes .
Similarly , I ’ve been trying out Opera periodically , as new releases came out , but again it did n’t seem to work for me .
The biggest complaint I had was its inability to render heavily - ajaxified web sites properly .
However , now it seems that the Opera Development Team made a big effort to improve the browser , and I was pleased to notice that Opera 9.5 b ( “ Kestrel ” ) does n’t seem to have this sort of problems at all .
h3 .
Planning the Switch
Firefox has extensions .
Plenty of them actually .
Some are useful , like the newish Del.icio.us one made by Yahoo , and also crappy ones you ’ll never use unless you want to have a fancy button on one of your over - cluttered toolbars which enables you to interface more easily with X or Y web services you hardly ever use .
By contrast , Opera never attempted to add full - blown extension support to its venerable and yet very powerful browser .
Instead , they kept building more and more features right into its core , being careful not to undermine the browser ’s two proverbial qualities : speed and stability .
What seemed a doomed philosophy at first turned out to be a good thingin the long run .
More and more people are getting more and more worried about Firefox ’s memory issues and begin to wander off to explore new things , exactly like I did .
The first step to switch from Firefox to Opera is to reduce the number of Firefox extensions to the bare minimum you need :
Colorzilla
Web Developer
MeasureIt
Search Status
Gmail Manager
Secure Login
Del.icio.us
The first three are related to Web Development only , which means that I do n’t need them unless I ’m doing some web - development tests during which I ’m always going to have more than one browser open anyway .
UPDATE : there are a few Ruler widget which can be used instead of MeasureIt ( thanks Ameer ) .
there are a few Ruler widget which can be used instead of MeasureIt ( thanks ) .
SearchStatus gives me Alexa Rank and Google Pagerank : I think I can survive without those for a while .
UPDATE : if not , there ’s always SEObar ( thanks Ameer ) .
if not , there ’s always SEObar ( thanks ) .
I use Gmail Manager because my girlfriend uses Gmail on the same computer .
I ’m switching to Opera and she ’ll stick with Firefox , so no problem there …
Secure Login ?
It ’s called Wand and it has been built - in into Opera for the last decade or so .
Del.icio.us – OK , I wo n’t be able to access my favorite tags as quickly , but someone already came out with a few handy buttons for a better integration with the popular social bookmarking service .
UPDATE : For a list of the features provided by Firefox extensions which are included in Opera , see Rijk ’s Top 150 Popular Firefox Extensions and Opera
How many extensions do you actually use ?
Here ’s a short analysis for the ones above :
Because I ’m addicted to betas , I immediately downloaded Opera Kestrel , i.e. Opera 9.50 beta 1 .
I never actually liked Opera ’s default theme , so I started looking around for new skins ( yes , eye - candy matters sometimes ) and came across the Ximple series by serafins .
In particular , 2nd thought – Jimple quickly became my favorite .
Tabs
“ Opera is the Web pioneer that delivered tabbed browsing in 2000 [ … ] ”
Opera tabs feel stable and mature .
Why ?
Probably because tabs are used more consistently to open not only web pages but also :
Downloads ( “ Transfers ” )
RSS feeds
feeds Notes
Emails
Bookmarks
Widget Management
Contacts
History
Page Links
I think this is a great feature and Firefox should definitely consider it : v3.0 comes with new download and bookmark managers , but they ’re still dialogs .
Yes , I know , there ’s probably some extension which allows you to display them in the sidebar , but that ’s not the point : Opera brings more consistency to the overall browsing experience by using tabs wherever they should be used .
Additionally , Opera tabs …
Can be rearranged , exactly like Firefox tabs
Can be restored , if closed accidently , by re-opening them from the Trash can
Can be locked , meaning that they ca n’t be closed accidently
Can be duplicated
Can be saved in groups ( sessions ) and re-opened later on
Can be restored if Opera crashes
Speed Dial
When you open Opera for the first time , and whenever you open a new empty tab the Speed Dial is displayed .
What I originally thought it was one of the most annoying things introduced by Opera 9 turned out to be actually useful and very addictive .
The idea behind it is simple :
Show a default page with 9 slots
Allow users to drag links to those slots
Display preview of each slot ( which is cached and can be updated by refreshing the page )
Allow users to quickly access pages saved in the Speed Dial via CTRL+1 .. CTRL+9 or simply by clicking them .
Simple and effective .
Once you get going with it , you ’ll overcome the initial feeling of imposition and you ’ll use it more and more : I literally can’t live without it now !
Right - click goodies
While I was testing Opera , my girlfriend came along and asked me to look something up on IMDB .
I normally had IMDB as custom search engine in Firefox , but unfortunately Opera did n’t seem to allow users to customize their search engines …
Totally wrong .
Not only Opera lets you add any search engine to the search bar , it also does it with style and in the easiest way possible :
Go to your search engine or any website with a search form Right click the search field Click Create Search …
Specify a name and a keyword for your search engine
Done .
You ’ll now be able to search that particular site directly from the search bar .
As you can see , I added Wikipedia , IMDB and even the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages in this way .
Besides creating searches , Opera lets you do a lot by right - clicking anywhere on a page :
Block Content : Right - click an empty area of any webpage and select Block Content to select which ads , scripts and images will be blocked from now on .
: Right - click an empty area of any webpage and select to select which ads , scripts and images will be blocked from now on .
Validate : Validate the HTML source code of the current page .

Edit Site Preferences … : Choose to block / allow cookies and popups , identify Opera as another browser , set a different encoding , enable / disable scripts , images , flash , etc .
These setting apply to the current web site only .

These setting apply to the current web site only .
View source , reload page every X seconds / minutes , send by email , etc .
Widgets
Opera Widgets must not be considered as Opera ’s counterpart to Firefox extensions .
Instead , Opera Widgets can be used as poor man ’s Vista Gadgets on Windows XP , and they do their job most remarkably .
I ’m personally very fond of these ones :
They all have a common trait : they all behave as standalone programs , as they should be .
The Wikipedia one , for example , can display Wikipedia entries directly inside the widget , unlike some others which just take you to Wikipedia , which is rather pointless .
Although widgets live within Opera , they can be displayed “ always behind ” , which means they ’ll be glued to your desktop and therefore will be visible whenever Opera and other applications are minimized .
Needless to say that anyone brave enough can make widgets for Opera by following a simple Widget Specification .
Everything you can do on the Internet
The term browser applied to Opera is somehow misleading .
Personally I would have called it something like “ Internet Suite ” , because that would be a better choice due to the features it offers and the things it can do .
Traditionally speaking , a web browser can be used to browse web pages , read feeds ( sometimes ) and navigate through FTP directories .
Here ’s what Opera can handle :
Web Pages –
No need of explanations here .
FTP – FTP directories are listed very clearly , overriding server ’s settings with a more user - friendly layout .
– directories are listed very clearly , overriding server ’s settings with a more user - friendly layout .
Local Files –
This was a surprise for me .
Typing file :// will automatically load a list of the drives currently available on your machine .
Similarly , auto - completion for directory and file names is supported !
I almost started using Opera as my everyday ’s file manager ( almost ) .

News – Opera can be used to signup and retrieve news from newsgroups .

BitTorrent Files –
By default , Opera can act as a BitTorrent client as well , so you can just open . torrent files through the program and then monitor the download progress in the Transfers window , like with any other normal download .
While this feature is indeed useful , it is also possible to disable it and still use your favorite BitTorrent client .
Portability and Synchronization
Let ’s spend some words about portability .
Sure , there are two “ Portable Opera ” apps out there , and they work well enough , but one thing I ’d like about a web browser is the ability to synchronize my preferences , customizations , themes , passwords etc. etc. across multiple computers .
Firefox is getting there , although the technology is still at a very early stage .
Opera is doing something similar through Opera Link , which allows you to synchronize automatically your Bookmarks , your Personal Bar and your Speed Dial .
All you need is to get a ( free ) Opera account , login to Opera Link and enable the synchronization feature from the File menu .
From now on every time you ’ll modify your Speed Dial or Bookmarks , the changes will be sent to your Opera Link page .
Similarly , whenever you start using opera somewhere else , if you login to your Opera Account you should be able to synchronize your Bookmarks and Speed Dial .
Here are some thoughts on this type of technology :
It ’s not totally private yet .
While it ’s great to be able to sync bookmarks and speed dial , the problems arise when you finish using your friend ’s computer for example … what happens to the bookmarks you just sync’ed ?
The only way to delete them would be to have your friend to log in to his Opera account and re-sync them .
Not enough privacy for my liking .
Your passwords , notes , widgets , etc. etc. cannot be synchronized yet , but that will hopefully be possible in near future .
Sync’ing bookmarks is pointless for me .
Although Opera still hopes to compete with Del.icio.us & Co. , that will be very hard to achieve .
I stopped using in - browser bookmarks long ago .
Link seems and interesting feature considering that Opera is available on virtually any operating system and a lot of different devices ( mobile phones , Nintendo DS & Wii , … ) .
At any rate , it is still possible to “ carry around ” your personal opera settings by following the instructions provided on this page which explains pretty much everything you need to know aboud Opera files and local storage .
Advanced Features
Opera looks more “ polished up ” than Firefox in most cases .
The superb usage of tabs for nearly everything is one example , and another one is the possibility to apply skins ( themes ) on - the - fly , without having to restart the browser .
Firefox can do this via the Personas extension , but Opera had this built - in for a long time .
To apply a new skin :
Go to the Skins Directory Download a skin you like Opera will download and apply the skin immediately , and it will ask you whether you want to keep it or not .
If you choose not to , it wo n’t save it in your profile ( very useful for quick previews ) .
Neat .
Another quality opera always excelled to is accessibility .
Besides using the interface in the traditional way , it is also possible to :
Use mouse gestures – I was n’t a big fan of this until I bothered reading the excellent documentation Opera provided for them ( which is significantly better than the Firefox ’s equivalent ) .
It can be quite useful at times .
– I was n’t a big fan of this until I bothered reading the excellent documentation Opera provided for them ( which is significantly better than the Firefox ’s equivalent ) .

Use keyboard shortcuts – Believe it or not , you can literally use Opera without a mouse .
– Believe it or not , you can literally use Opera without a mouse .
Speak to it – Opera ’s voice integration is getting better and better .
Not only you can effectively tell your browser what to do , you can also use the built - in text - to - speech function ( Windows only ) to have it read entire pages for you .
It actually works quite well and it can parse punctuation well enough to apply the right intonation .
Just for fun , I had it read it an Italian page … and it actually worked as expected : it was like listening to an American reading an Italian text using US pronuntiation !
Finally , power users will be delighted of the way opera lets you hack the program settings , as you can :
Use Tools >
Quick Preferences to block / unblock popups , cookies , Java applets , images , etc .

Annoyances
After using as main browser for a few weeks now , I can say that it ’s great but not perfect yet .
It ’s very advanced , faster and more mature than any other browser , of course , but there are a few things which should be fixed or improved .
In particular :
It ’s not open source – This may not matter to someone , but some people consider this an essential requirement for their browser , and that ’s why Firefox is their most obvious choice .
Although Opera is free , it is proprietary software after all , which means is definitely not as open as you may want it to be .
Personally I ’m not too bothered , as I ’m starting to think that too much openness may lead to too many unuseful and bloated extensions and make the program somehow “ unpredictable ” and heavy .

No address bar search – Amazingly , only Firefox seems to have this feature built - in .
I ’m referring to the ability to type whatever in the address bar to be redirected to the site returned by a Google ’s I ’m feeling lucky search .
It is possible to emulate this feature in Opera by creating a custom search for I ’m Feeling Lucky and assign it a short keyword like “ l ” .
In this way , for example , typing in l h3rald should lead you to this website .
Not quite as immediate as in Firefox though .
No find as you type – Another big disappointment for who comes from Firefox or Safari : Opera still uses a dialog box to perform page searches .
No spell clecking – Again , both Firefox and Safari now offer text fields spell checking .
Opera does n’t yet .
No HTML mail composer – Opera ’s built - in mail client can display HTML emails but does n’t yet allow users to create them .
Auto - start widgets ?
–
This is a feature enhancement Opera Dev Team should consider : allow users to configure certain widgets to start automatically when Opera starts .
Google Reader +
Flash problems – Sometimes I experiences some scrolling problems when reading news which contain embedded flash movies on Google Reader .
Corporate Sites – Unfortunately some corporate web site do not support Opera or are not displayed correctly in Opera .
Unfortunately there ’s nothing much we can do about it but trying to “ mask ” Opera as another browser ( via right - click > Edit Site Preferences … )

Conclusion
Despite the few annoyances listed in the previous section , Opera 9.5 beta 1 truly impressed me .
I was waiting for Opera to get better before switching and now I ’ve not been using Firefox for a few weeks .
Although Opera offers a lot of features , there ’s still room for improvements , especially for what concerns integration with third party services : I would really like to see some sort of integration with del.icio.us , and that could be possible via widgets at least .
Regarding the new Opera Link feature , it looks very promising and a potential competitor for Mozilla Weave even though it will be used mainly to get more and more users to register to the Opera community ( I did , at least ) , which is indeed very active any way .
To conclude this article , which still barely scratches the surface of this very powerful application , I ’d like to praise two more things about Opera :
Their website network , and in particular their truly excellent documentation knowledge base , which is very comprehensive of references , tutorials and interesting articles .
I am a full time technical writer myself , and I ’ve hardly ever come across better documentation .
Their extensive support and compliance to web standards , which makes Opera the most advanced browser ever made .
If you ’ve not tried Opera before , or if you ’ve always dismissed it because “ X browser is better ” , you may want to give it another shot : for me it was definitely worthwhile !
The August employment numbers looked better than they actually were for two reason :
#1) Nearly 600,000 people were simply dropped from the labor force .
That 's not unprecedented during a recession , but it is unprecedented when the economy is supposedly " strong " like the Federal Reserve and White House tells us it is .
If those people had not been dropped from the labor force then the unemployment rate would have spiked up .
# 2) The BLS added 120,000 jobs through their Birth / Death Model .
The Birth / Death Model is supposed to catch jobs that are created by the " birth " of businesses not surveyed in the payroll survey .
The number of jobs included in this model are estimates based on past data .
In other words , the BLS tries to apply data to the present based on data from a year ago .
The August Birth / Death Model added 11,000 financial jobs and 15,000 construction jobs .
Let 's apply a little common sense here : does anyone really believe that 11,000 more financial jobs were created last month while the entire credit industry was seizing up ?
Does anyone really believe that the construction industry was adding more jobs while the real estate market was contracting ?
But this news was nothing compared to the bigger , badder news that came out Friday .
The dollar dropped to the lowest in a month against the euro on concern the worst housing slump in 16 years and a credit market rout may push the U.S. into a recession .
One month low .
Big deal , right ?
You have to read much further down in the article to see the significant news .
The U.S. dollar index comparing the currency with its six primary peers fell to as low as 79.841 yesterday , the weakest in 15 years , from 80.791 on Aug. 31 .
A 15 - year low is a big deal , yet it barely got reported at all .
You do n't suppose that those hundreds of billions of mortgage - backed securities that we 've sold foreigners over the last 10 years , the vast majority of which can not be sold now for any price , has something to do with the fact that the dollar is dropping ?
Louis has won contracts to supply supermarkets with his chocolates
Louis Barnett , from Kinver , Staffs , left school aged 11 after being diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia and began making chocolates at home .
New contracts have meant he has had to expand his firm Chokolit and has moved to a factory in Bridgnorth , Shropshire .
He has taken on new staff , including his parents Phil and Mary Barnett .
Louis has been like this right from day one , he is a hard worker and is very enthusiastic about his product
Mary Barnett , mother
Louis said : " I 've always been a very foody person and conscious of where my food comes from .
" I 've been doing bits of baking and making cakes with my mum since I was about four or five and really it was just one of my passions . "
The young entrepreneur started out with a 12 oz ( 340 gram ) chocolate machine , making one mould at a time for family and friends .
' Huge risk '
Now he produces hundreds of chocolates and has won contracts to supply Sainsbury 's and Waitrose at Christmas .
His dad Phil quit his job to work with Louis and the 15 - year - old 's former home tutor Jan is also employed at the confectionery firm .
Mary Barnett said : " Louis has been like this right from day one , he is a hard worker and is very enthusiastic about his product .
" It 's a huge risk , Phil has given up his job and we 've put a lot of money in , but we believe that he 'll do it . "

The negative impact of high healthcare costs on the national economy may not be fully recognized .
At over $ 1.4 trillion a year , healthcare costs represent 15 % — approximately a seventh — of our total gross domestic product .
Our annual cost per capita , $ 4,662.00 , is nearly double that of health care in other countries .
This excessive and constantly increasing cost prevents many businesses from hiring as many workers as they otherwise might .
What Do We Get for Our Healthcare Dollar ?
Here in the United States the consensus is that we have the highest quality health care in the world .
We surely have the most expensive .
If we have the best perhaps it is worth what we are paying .
How can we determine the quality of health care in the United States ?
Quality can be difficult to measure .
Much of what we might call quality is subjective .
One way to get a handle on quality is to measure and compare outcomes .
Better results should correlate with higher quality care .
Let 's look at both ends of the human lifespan and compare the results our healthcare system gets with those in other countries .
If we compare infant mortality rates here in the United States with that of other modern industrialized countries , we find that our healthcare system is not doing the best job .
Statistics for the year 2002 reveal that at least 36 countries beat us in infant survival .
We experienced 6.69 infant deaths for every 1000 live births .
France , Germany , Spain , Greece , Japan , Portugal , Malta , Macau , Italy , Singapore , United Kingdom , New Zealand , Aruba , Gibraltar , Hong Kong and over twenty other countries had lower infant mortality rates than did the United States .
We can give our healthcare system a passing grade if we wish but it certainly can't be considered excellent .
We are paying for excellent , but we are getting only average .
Now let 's look at the other end of human life .
How does longevity in the United States compare with that of other countries ?
Ranked by 2001 life expectancy at birth , the United States is 42nd in the world .
Our country is behind Andorra , Macau , Japan , Singapore , Australia , Switzerland , Hong Kong , Spain , France , Germany , Greece , and more than thirty other countries .
A baby born in the U.S.A. in 2001 had a life expectancy of 77.26 years .
A child born in Macau at the same time could expect to live to the ripe old age of 83.47 years .
Clearly our healthcare system is not even close to being the best when judging by longevity .
Childbirth and old age infirmities are no better treated here than in many countries around the world .
The healthcare systems of many countries do a much better job than ours .
It does n't appear that we are getting our money 's worth in healthcare quality — the quality just is n't there .
Perhaps all the extra money we in the United States spend on health care goes not for extra quality but rather for added safety .
Everything a living creature does involves risk .
And so it is with us humans .
Just getting into our automobile for a drive to the grocery store involves some risk .
We assume that risk is negligible .
We make an appointment to see our doctor .
Is such an appointment without risk ?
The answer is no .
Each year between 6,000 and 9,000 people die of treatment injuries and prescriptions received from their doctor at his office .
Even more alarming are the risks once you are admitted to a hospital .
Conservative estimates show that between 98,000 and 140,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals each year from accidental injuries , medication errors , and adverse drug reactions .
This is not patients dying of their diseases ; it is patients dying of their treatment !
Millions more are injured each year by our healthcare industry .
These figures can be compared with those for another industry , for example the commercial airlines .
For the airline industry to do as bad a job of protecting airline passengers as the healthcare industry does at protecting patients , there would have to be two major airline crashes each day .
The problem is so bad that in the year 2000 President Clinton set up a special task force to address it .
The terrorists ' attacks of 9/11/01 necessarily altered our priorities and nothing of substance has yet been done about these medical dangers .
Clearly , though , the exorbitant prices we are paying for health care in the United States is not buying us an extra measure of safety .
Medical Regulation and the AMA
Besides paying some of the highest prices for health care , we have the dubious distinction of having the most heavily regulated healthcare system in the world .
In no other country on earth are doctors and hospitals subjected to as many oversight and enforcement agencies , bureaus and commissions .
Rules , regulations , and laws are duplicated , redundant , multiplied , magnified , and contradictory .
Laws and regulations covering doctors and hospitals plus all the other parts of our healthcare system now account for over half of all the words , sentences , and paragraphs in our entire body of law .
If regulations could make a healthcare system work better , ours would surely be perfect .
In fact , the opposite has occurred .
Even those who believe that only government regulation can assure quality health care should face this fact .
More laws and regulations are not going to fix our system .
If we are truly concerned about the high cost of health care , if we really desire greater safety and higher quality , then we must undertake a dispassionate analysis of the current mess .
If we wish to begin effective treatment of our healthcare system , we must first make an accurate diagnosis .
To make the correct diagnosis in a complicated medical case it is often helpful to have patients recount their first encounter with their symptoms .
So it is with understanding the conundrum we call our healthcare system .
We have to go very far back to the first meeting of what would become the American Medical Association .
This meeting was held in New York City in 1846 .
Twenty - nine allopathic doctors ( MDs ) attended the meeting .
They wanted to establish a monopoly over health care in the United States for those doctors that practiced higher quality medicine , such as themselves .
They felt there were too many different kinds of doctors practicing too many questionable forms of medicine .
They wanted only doctors that conformed to their brand of medicine to be allowed to practice .
They wished to set up their association as a medical elite and obtain a government - enforced monopoly over health care in the United States .
The following year the AMA was officially launched .
Members ' efforts were at first slow to yield results .
One of their first successes was in getting the exclusive right to positions in the federal government .
Then , around 1870 , the AMA began to find success at setting up medical boards in each state .
The rationale behind these medical boards was twofold .
First , it was assumed that only doctors knew enough about medicine to be able to determine whether a physician was competent .
And second , it was felt that doctors accused of misconduct should not be subjected to the public humiliation of an open trial .
Typically the AMA would team up with key lawmakers in a state and lobby for legislation to " protect public safety . "
The idea was that incompetent and unscrupulous doctors were doing great harm to healthcare consumers .
There was no proof of this , but it was their claim .
A state consumer protection agency staffed by AMA members was promoted .
That is , a state board made up of AMA members would examine applicants who wanted to practice medicine and only license those who were , according to them , competent and morally fit .
So each state in turn passed a Medical Practice
Act which created a board of medical examiners with police powers to enforce their decisions .
It was critical to the AMA 's long - range plans that states establish these medical boards .
How Medical Boards Work
These boards have two broad areas of activity : licensing and enforcement .
In the examining and licensing of physicians , their efforts are directed toward keeping the race pure .
Only MDs please .
A few osteopathic doctors have been accepted recently , but historically it has been an exclusive MD club .
In the area of enforcement , any doctor that engages in activity that may embarrass the profession can expect a call from his medical board .
Physician pedophiles , physician sexual predators , physician addicts and drug abusers , psychotic and psychopathic doctors , as well as doctors who flagrantly endanger their patients with their medical treatments , are called before the medical board .
If there has not been much media attention and the situation can be handled quietly by the board , the doctor may only have his license suspended .
He may be placed in rehabilitation .
Most , in time will get their license back and quietly return to practice .
The medical board , like any good fraternal organization , will protect its own .
The Catholic Church protects its priests .
The medical boards protect their doctors
If , on the other hand , the press gets to the story first , then the doctor may find the board much less accommodating .
There is the need to show the media , the public , and the government that the board is aggressive in enforcing its regulations , in protecting the public , and in prosecuting physician offenders .
So in those cases where the consumers ' interest parallels the boards , ' the public does receive protection from dangerous doctors .
There is one category of physician transgressor in particular the board will treat more harshly than any other .
The major but unspoken mission of the state medical boards is to protect MDs from market competition .
Is this not the main focus or purpose of labor unions and trade associations ?
State medical boards are the enforcement wing of the American Medical Association .
State medical boards masquerade as consumer protection agencies to get public support , police powers , and taxpayer dollars .
The Federation of State Medical Boards was organized to coordinate the fifty state medical boards and serve as liaison between them and the AMA .
This combination and collaboration of AMA , Federation of State Medical Boards , and the state boards of medical examiners to form a medical monopoly was complete by 1912 .
Such combining of state and corporate entities is not unique to this AMA / state medical board combo .
It was a popular approach at the start of the twentieth century .
The common name for this arrangement is fascism .
As Benito Mussolini pointed out , " fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power . "
Therefore what we have here in the United States is medical corporatism or medical fascism — or , even more precisely , a medical fascist monopoly .
This medical monopoly has throughout the twentieth century continued to consolidate and strengthen its power .
It has attacked any would - be competitor to its hegemony .
The true purpose of this medical monopoly , like all monopolies , is to control the market .
And it does so , as many would - be healthcare reformers have learned .
Thus the state medical boards ' greatest wrath is reserved for those doctors that dare to try innovations that may affect the medical marketplace .
This fascist monopoly considers the healthcare marketplace its private domain .
The physician dare not tamper with healthcare delivery .
Innovations that may lower fees or streamline delivery of services cannot be tolerated by a system whose fundamental purpose is to uphold and increase its members ' incomes and its political power .
Medical Boards and the Destruction of Competition
Soon after the medical monopoly was formed it began to push its agenda of destroying all competition .
A well organized and funded nationwide purge of all non-MDs was undertaken .
Over the course of the first half of the twentieth century this medical monopoly managed to shut down over forty medical schools .
Their idea was to keep the number of doctors low in order to keep fees up .
After WW II the medical monopoly started rigidly controlling how many of each medical specialty it would allow to be trained .
So ophthalmologists , orthopedists , dermatologists , obstetricians , and others began to be in short supply .
And of course when supplies are low , fees are high .
The medical monopoly also managed to outlaw or marginalize over seventy healthcare professions .
Protection of the healthcare consumer was , as always , the rationale for this power grab .
Whether the object of destruction by the medical monopoly be homeopaths , midwives , chiropractors , or internet prescribers , the purge is conducted in the same manner .
No scientific proof or research data is offered to discredit these practitioners .
The entire approach is one of character assassination directed at their profession .
On one occasion the medical monopoly did try to behave " scientifically , " but this approach backfired :
They tried to show that obstetricians achieved a lower infant mortality rate than did midwives , but when the data was compiled it showed the reverse was true — midwives had the better record .
The medical monopoly quickly abandoned this approach and returned to their proven method of buying lawmakers and writing nasty unsubstantiated accusations in their journals .
It seems the public always falls for propaganda that promises greater consumer safety .
Every state has a state medical trade association or state medical society .
Each county has a county medical group or association .
A doctor must be a member of the AMA to be a member of the state and county associations , and conversely will automatically become a state and country association member when he or she joins the AMA .
Membership on a hospital staff usually requires a doctor to be a member of these associations .
Academic or government employment requires a physician to be a member of these associations .
Most research grants to physicians require that he be a member " in good standing " with the AMA .
Many doctors have no choice :
They must be members .
The innumerable committees , commissions , boards and bureaus that control medical education , medical school enrollment , accreditation of medical schools , accreditation of specialty residency training programs , foreign medical graduates , medical licensure in every state , and so on , all rely upon physicians to function .
So do dozens of state and Federal agencies such as the FDA .
And all the physicians that attain this level of government service are in hock to the medical monopoly .
Do you really believe the FDA 's opposition to importation of drugs from Canada is based on science and safety ?
Most of the control exerted over physicians comes through intimidation .
" Letters of agreement " carefully placed out of view leave little paper trail .
AMA members simply cannot be trusted on any issues that may affect the healthcare marketplace .
And the higher up the bureaucratic ladder their post , the less credibility they should be accorded .
A physician cannot afford to trifle with the medical board .
This monopoly by the AMA and state medical boards now serves the interest of very few physicians .
Most doctors are working so hard and for such long hours that they do not realize that their leadership has long since abandoned them .
Except for the bureaucracy that runs the medical monopoly , government medical bureaucrats and some physicians that run HMOs , health insurance companies , or pharmaceutical companies , most doctors gain little and lose much under the current system .
Physicians are forced to depend upon the state medical boards for their professional status and their livelihood .
Thus , the current healthcare mess results from actions of the medical monopoly .
And the linchpin that holds the medical monopoly together and makes it work is the state medical board system .
The correct diagnosis for our healthcare crisis , then , is that the system was designed from the ground up to promote and profit a monopoly .
Our healthcare system is doing precisely what it was designed to do .
How Corporatism Arises
We can now analyze the market situation from this perspective .
What we find is that in the United States we have a government - enforced price floor with a free market price ceiling .
Thus prices can go up , but not down — which are , of course , exactly what prices for medical services are doing and have been doing for many years .
The object of labor unions , trade associations , and the medical monopoly is always to control the floor price .
Labor unions generally do this by negotiating contracts with employers , a legitimate activity in a free market .
Monopolies , however , are formed when an industry uses government power to enforce a price floor .
When government price controls are applied to both the floor and ceiling we have a socialized industry .
And in the absence of government control of either floor or ceiling prices we have price competition or free enterprise .
I am not suggesting that the decreasing competitiveness of American workers is due entirely to healthcare costs .
But I am suggesting much of the competitiveness of American workers in the world market is being sacrificed to the medical monopoly .
What is even worse is that the very viability and future of our country is being plundered in the name of health .
Medical Corporatism and Its Economic Effects
When any doctor feels threatened by competition from any source , he may complain about it to the leadership of his associations .
It may be a complaint that he is experiencing too much competition from the local chiropractors or from a naturopath that just moved into the area .
Or the complaint may be of a fellow MD of a different specialty infringing on his turf .
A surgeon might complain of a general practitioner doing surgery or an obstetrician may complain about a family physician delivering babies .
The complaint will make its way from county or state association leadership to the AMA central office in Chicago .
If the complaint is widespread enough and loud enough the AMA may decide to take action .
In that case the AMA will reconfigure the complaint so that it is expressed in the form of a safety concern .
The complaint may be , " too many chiropractors are hurting my income . "
This will be changed to , " we are concerned that some in the chiropractic profession may be overstepping their areas of expertise and jeopardizing patient safety . "
The next step is to run editorials in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) .
The gist of the editorial will be that certain practices by chiropractors must stop as they endanger patients .
This will be followed by editorials in a few other associated journals .
Physicians will then write in letters to the editor of a number of other medical letters and journals with anecdotal evidence and testimonials regarding the " dangerous " activity .
The AMA , by means of the Federation of State Medical Boards , then sends out the word to all 50 state medical boards that these " dangerous " activities must be stopped .
The state attorneys general are notified by their medical boards that it has been determined that this activity represents a danger to consumers and must be investigated and prosecuted .
Attorneys General have no mechanism to evaluate the veracity of any of the medical boards ' positions , so they prepare to act .
The state attorneys general , through their own national organization , may meet to draft coordinated efforts to fight these " crimes . "
If the targeted healthcare providers have no license to practice medicine from the AMA - controlled medical boards , they are prosecuted for " practicing medicine without a license . "
If the group is licensed by the medical board , then its members are accused of practicing " below the standard of care . "
No evidence , no facts are ever offered or ever needed .
No individual or group has any rights when up against the medical monopoly .
The Bill of Rights and the Constitution do not apply .
In this way homeopaths , naturopaths , chiropractors , herbalists , and dozens of other kinds of healthcare practitioners , as well as thousands of MDs attempting innovations of all kinds , have been marginalized , had their licenses revoked , or been outlawed .
Most members of the state medical boards are appointed by the governor .
State and county medical associations , medical specialty societies , large medical group practices , HMO's , health insurance companies , chain and wholesale pharmacies , and large hospital chains contribute heavily to the campaigns of candidates for governor and attorney general .
Thus , the governor appoints to the state medical board those desired by the medical monopoly .
Doctors selected by the medical monopoly for appointment to the state medical board can be counted on to cooperate .
And it works the same way with the State Board of Pharmacy .
The medical monopoly contributes heavily to congressmen and maintains one of the best - financed and most effective lobbying programs in Washington , D.C.
It is important that the AMA , the state medical board , and the state attorney general in each state work hand - in - glove to further the interest of the medical monopoly .
By requiring and obtaining the rigid compliance of its members , this medical monopoly has grown in strength and influence throughout the twentieth century .
Doctors live in fear of having their license to practice medicine revoked .
Many citizens rightly fear the IRS — the fear that doctors have of the state medical board is as great or greater :
The powers of the state medical boards are even more arbitrary and capricious than those of the IRS .
Phrases like " below the standard of care " and " unethical behavior " are intentionally vague and nonspecific .
Any charge can be " substantiated , " no defense is sufficient .
The medical board even has the power to overrule the judicial system and does so regularly !
Attaining an MD degree represents a great deal of work and a considerable monetary investment .
License revocation means not only loss of the doctor 's livelihood , but a devastating blow both socially and professionally .
Few physicians will go anywhere near that possibility .
The ability of state medical boards to intimidate doctors into complying with their wishes is legendary .
Board members are instructed in the use of intimidation techniques and rely on them as much as they do on the Attorney General .
Accordingly , no outcry should be expected from within the profession .
Health care in the United States has been nationalized — not by the government , but by a trade association .
By the 1950s , power had been consolidated to the point where the medical monopoly had what it had been working for all along : total control over health care in the United States .
Corporatism in Action : The Medical Board of California
As an example of the huge threat to public safety these medical boards can represent , consider the Medical Board of California .
This board has n't decided a major issue in favor of consumers for decades .
The agency is virtually owned by the Golden State 's HMOs , health insurance companies , big chain pharmacies , hospital chains , and medical trade associations .
The California medical monopoly has every right to its arrogant smugness when you realize that gullible taxpayers are funding its greatest asset .
A good example of how efficiently the California Medical Board works to protect the monopoly 's profits and market share is to look at the board 's response to the Internet .
The Internet is simply a tool , and like any tool it can be used for good purposes or bad purposes .
Internet communications are a natural for computer - assisted diagnosis and medication selection .
By outsourcing the physical examination and using the Internet , a physician can easily increase his efficiency and productivity more than 5 fold .
This should have the effect of lowering the cost of an " office " visit by 80 % .
In other words , it should have the same market effect as greatly increasing the number of doctors .
The possibility of the Internet lowering healthcare fees this much has sent the California medical monopoly into hysterical apoplexy .
The problem , from the monopoly 's point of view , was exacerbated by the fact that health care in California is arguably the worst in the country .
It is so bad that patients seek to escape over the Internet in hopes of finding better medical services elsewhere .
As a result , in the late 1990s HMOs throughout the State panicked at the prospect of losing their patients to Internet physicians .
Pharmacists panicked at the prospect of Internet pharmacies taking their business .
So the Medical Board of California was pressed into action .
There is absolutely no evidence that medical diagnosis and treatment via the Internet is more dangerous than it is in other settings .
Research shows that , because of computer assistance , the adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) rate for Internet prescribing is considerably lower than the ADR rate experienced in physicians ' offices and hospitals .
Nevertheless the Board was compelled to declare Internet physicians and Internet prescribing a threat to public safety .
With medical trade groups and others in the California healthcare industry , they launched a propaganda campaign to discredit Internet medicine almost before it could get started .
The Board gave false testimony to the California Legislature ( nothing too unusual about this ) and successfully lobbied for laws outlawing Internet medicine .
These laws were passed and went into effect January 1 , 2001 .
These laws deny California healthcare consumers access to safe , effective , convenient , and less costly health services while protecting the profits of big intra-state healthcare providers .
In this example the Medical Board of California sided with the California Medical Association , HMOs , and the pharmacy chains .
On every issue over the decades the pattern has been the same .
The Board always decides in favor of the healthcare industry and against the interest of California healthcare consumers .
It is through the consistent efforts of state medical boards such as the one in California that healthcare costs are pressed higher each and every year .
By squashing all innovation that could adversely affect physicians ' fees and provider profits , these boards provide the first wall of protection for the medical monopoly .
The agencies that are charged with protecting the healthcare consumer have been taken hostage by the very industry they were set up to regulate .
Most healthcare consumer groups either do n't get it or have their own axe to grind .
Everywhere patients and their pocketbooks are being exploited .
Nobody is looking out for them .
Web sites are proliferating on the World Wide Web that offer legal and illegal addictive drugs and require no more information than that on your credit card .
A number of deaths have occurred , both accidents and suicides , from drugs obtained from such sites .
How much of the explosion in the number of such sites is the result of the void caused by so few physician - supervised Internet sites ?
Physicians with an interest in Internet medicine have been intimidated or disciplined into staying away or leaving Internet practice .
Medical boards are perfectly able to differentiate between websites where physicians exercise their professional discretion in diagnosis and treatment , which may involve issuing a prescription and those where drugs are simply sold .
It serves the medical monopoly 's goal of abolishing Internet medicine to blur this distinction .
The Federation of State Medical Boards uses every Internet drug tragedy as an opportunity to portray all Internet medicine as irresponsible .
This is the medical monopoly 's standard approach , well practiced for over a hundred years .
The Call for Medical Freedom
We should strongly consider abolishing state medical boards .
Do we really need an additional and separate secret police for doctors ?
If we elect to keep the state medical board system , then governors should not be allowed to appoint doctors to medical boards or pharmacists to boards of pharmacy .
This is like putting the foxes in charge of henhouse security !
If these are supposed to be consumer protection agencies , then staff them with consumers .
The ideal board member is the owner - operator of a small business .
Such boards could consult anyone they wish for technical or professional advice .
I am sure that the Federal Trade Commission has looked at this , probably more than once .
The legal problem is that the AMA does not directly intervene in the marketplace .
The medical monopoly is cleverly divided up into numerous components with legal separations that make it nearly impossible to mount an effective antitrust case .
The AMA makes sure that it stays at arms length from the state medical boards and even has the Federation of State Medical Boards in between .
The communication , cooperation , and even conspiratorial planning between the components of the medical monopoly are unquestionable , but such contact is always couched in terms of protecting the public .
If , however , the state medical board system were abolished , or disempowered , the medical monopoly would suffer a fatal blow .
Cut off the small head of a giant rattlesnake and the huge body of the snake is rendered harmless .
The beneficial effect of such action to healthcare consumers , American workers , and the economy would be enormous and immediate .
Less appreciated would be an even more important effect :
The breakup of the medical monopoly would go a long way toward taking American medicine out of its current political orientation and back into its proper scientific orientation .
There is no reason that other healthcare professionals should n't have prescription writing privileges .
This aspect of the medical monopoly also needs to be broken up .
Pharmacists , nurses , physician 's assistants , psychologists , nurse practitioners , physical therapists , respiratory therapists , chiropractors , and many others , perhaps with some additional training , could safely prescribe those medications that apply to their area of expertise .
The notion that a physical examination by an MD is routinely required in order to safely prescribe medication is more hokum .
There is not a shred of scientific evidence to support such a contention .
It is just another excuse for monopoly control .
The fewer industries there are with government - enforced price floors , the fewer structural straightjackets there are on our national economy .
The freer our economy , the more likely it will be vibrant and expansive .
A vibrant and expansive economy produces jobs and innovations .
Byproducts include an improving standard of living and a strong military .
I have spent the greater part of a lifetime studying the organization of American medicine .
You may find all this information crammed into one essay overwhelming .
To you it may even seem preposterous that a huge monopoly exists right in the midst of the world 's freest country .
One of the signers of our Declaration of Independence was the physician and psychiatrist Benjamin Rush , MD .
He was also involved in writing our Constitution .
He warned , " unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution , the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship to restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others ; the Constitution of the Republic should make a special privilege for medical freedom as well as religious freedom . "
Dr. Rush also believed the Constitution of the United States should explicitly abolish black slavery .
Neither of his warnings was heeded , with great harm to our nation .
We have gone a long way toward rectifying one of these Constitutional omissions .
It is now time to begin addressing Dr. Rush 's other concern .
As our nation seeks to promote freedom , democracy , and free enterprise around the world , we must not smugly assume that no fights for freedom remain to be fought here at home .
Surely if we can topple a dictator and put a Baath party on the run halfway around the world , we can do the same here .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Former CBS
News anchor Dan Rather says the $ 70 million lawsuit he filed Wednesday against his former employer is an effort to strike a blow against political and corporate influence that he believes threatens the independence of American journalism .
Dan Rather , here in July 2006 , said that corporate and political influence may cause a chilling effect on journalism .
" This is the right stand , at the right time , about the right issue , " Rather told CNN 's Larry King Thursday night , in his first TV interview since filing the suit .
" We have to , somehow , get back to integrity in the news and somehow at least alleviate , if not eliminate , these big corporate and big government pressures . "
" You can't have freedom of the press if you 're going to have large , big corporations and big government intruding and intimidating in newsrooms .
The chilling effect on investigative reporting is going to be something we do n't want to see , " he said .
Rather 's breach of contract suit charges that CBS made him the scapegoat when the network came under intense criticism over a September 2004 " 60 Minutes II " story challenging President Bush 's service in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War .
Immediately after the story aired , critics began questioning the authenticity of documents used to buttress allegations that Bush did not fulfill his military commitments .
Rather , who narrated the disputed piece , became the target of fierce criticism from conservative partisans who believed the story was an attempt to influence the 2004 presidential race .
Six months later , he stepped down from the anchor chair he had occupied for nearly a quarter century -- a departure he says was not voluntary .
In his interview with King , Rather again defended the accuracy of the story and said " I think there 's a lot more in the president 's military record that we do n't know about . "
" Nobody to this day has proved these documents were fraudulent , " Rather said .
" The story was true . "
He also said an independent investigative panel commissioned by CBS , which issued a report highly critical of the story , was a " fraud . "
" It was a set - up , " Rather said of the investigation , headed by former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and former Associated Press chief Louis Boccardi , which led to the firing of a producer and the resignations of three executives .
" It was designed to achieve a certain result so that the corporation would be exonerated . "
Rather 's suit alleges that management at CBS and its then parent company , Viacom , shifted blame to him to pacify the White House and that on the day after Bush was re-elected , he was informed he would be removed as anchor of the CBS Evening News .
The suit maintains that inaccuracies in the National Guard report have " never been established , " but , even if there were errors , he was not responsible for them because he " played largely a supervisory role " in the production of the broadcast and was assured by others that the documents had been authenticated .
After initially defending the piece , CBS later retracted it , and Rather later made an on - air statement admitting the network could n't vouch for the authenticity of the documents and calling the decision to air the story a " mistake in judgment . "
However , Rather now charges in his lawsuit that he was " coerced " by CBS management " into publicly apologizing and taking blame for alleged journalistic errors in the broadcast . "
Rather told King that he agreed to read the on-air apology -- largely written by other people -- to " play team " and help the organization where he had worked for more than 40 years .
" I did n't want to apologize .
I did n't think we should apologize , " he said .
He also said he did n't realize at the time that the apology was part of an effort by management to " make sure that they shifted whatever blame there was going to be ... away from themselves and put it on me and some other good people in the news division . "
Rather said that in the weeks leading up to broadcast , he was not deeply involved in National Guard story because he was extremely busy covering a number of other major news stories , including a hurricane and the Republican National Convention .
He also said he was not invited to the final screening of the piece before it aired , which was attended by two corporate attorneys and a host of CBS executives , including Andrew Heyward , then president of the news division .
" I depended on a team of people to vet it , " he said .
" Did n't happen . "
Rather said he is not interested in gaining financially from the suit and will donate a " substantial part " of any damages he collects to journalism organizations who work to keep " hard - nosed investigative reporting alive . "
Rather 's suit names as defendants CBS and its CEO , Leslie Moonves ; Heyward ; and Viacom and its CEO , Sumner Redstone .
Reacting to the suit , CBS issued a statement saying " these complaints are old news , and this lawsuit is without merit . "
Contacted for their reaction , Moonves and Heyward referred CNN to the CBS statement ; Viacom and Redstone refused comment .

The Whore on Christmas The Ups and Downs of Being a Sex Worker During the Holidays
Justin DeGarmo
That 's sadder than a whore on Christmas . "
The first time I had sex for money on Christmas , I was 21 and I 'd been a call girl for a little over two years .
I do n't care a whole lot about Christmas .
I have no objection to a one - day holiday , but I hate being beaten over the head with stockings and carols and Santa Claus for eight weeks , and I hate being told when I should feel jolly or giving .
However , contrary to the sad - and - lonely whore stereotype , I have a large extended family .
I may be the black sheep , but my family is determined to gather me into the fold — whether I like it or not .
It 's not that my relatives are n't nice people .
It 's just that when we all get together to have a Christmas celebration , it 's as if the punch bowl was spiked with 151 - proof banality and tedium .
Granted , at 21 I was still baiting my Southern - conservative family with my spiked hair , goth clothing , and sweeping pronouncements about the virtues of nationalized health care and gun control .
I was used to being the target of some teasing .
But attempting to be patient throughout a day of speculation about why I was the only female grandchild not married and pregnant left me deeply envious of orphans .
I was sitting in a plaid recliner in my grandmother 's living room , hoping the rum in my Coke would deafen me to the screams of my cousins and the roar of the football game my uncles were watching on TV , when my mother said , " Honey , something in your purse is beeping . "
My pager ?
The only person who had that number was the owner of the escort service I worked for .
" Must be the alarm on that sports watch I got , " I offered .
" I 'll go turn it off . "
I took the phone from my grandmother 's bedside table , dragged the long cord into her closet , closed the door , and dialed my service .
" Hi , sweetie , " said my boss .
" Thanks for calling back .
Listen , I 'm sorry to bother you on Christmas , I know I said we'd be closed .
But this guy I know called , he 's really nice , and he 's stuck here on business .
He wanted to know if we had anybody who'd come down to the Hyatt to see him .
Any chance you 'd do it ?
He 'll tip you big time . "
An automatic , " No , I can 't " rose to my lips , but before I said it , a piercing wail penetrated the closet door , as the effects of too much sugar and too little sleep took their toll on the Fisher - Price set .
I heard my Aunt Alice calling me to come to the kitchen and whip the cream for the pies .
I thought about my options for a moment : kitchens , football , and screaming children — or go fuck a strange man for money .
" What 's his room number ? " I said .
" I 'll be there in half an hour . "
I told my family that my neighbor thought she 'd smelled smoke by my apartment door , and it was probably nothing , but I just had to run home and check .
The client was pleasant and uncomplicated , and the sterile beige serenity of the hotel , with its silent hallways and clean white sheets , was a balm .
I returned to my grandmother 's house to have some pie — someone else had whipped the cream — and then it was time for everyone to go home .
It was the best family Christmas party ever .
The expression " sadder than a whore on Christmas " is based on the notion that whores , presumably ostracized by loved ones ( not always the case ) , are also deserted by their customers on December 25 .
While I am a pro domme now , I spent the first 10 years of my sex - work career straight - up fucking for money .
And my experience says that while other people 's Christmases may be white , Christmas can be nicely green for whores .
That 's because I 'm not the only one who needs relief from the pressure of enforced family togetherness .
Whenever I 've worked on Christmas , most of my clients have also been ducking out of family gatherings and they 've fallen through my door like men pursued by wolves .
And most of them have said something like : " I gave presents to everybody else , this is my present to myself ! "
" Oh yeah , they say the same kind of thing to me , " said my friend Jae as we stood surveying the buffet at a holiday party .
Jae works as a call girl , and she 's had similar experiences working on Christmas .
" So I started putting long ribbons and bows around myself — if I 'm a present , unwrap me . "
And , yes , she really does that .
" Some years I get the sexy - Santa outfit request a lot , " Jae added .
" Especially if there 's some kind of TV special with chicks in sexy - Santa outfits .
Guys get triggered by the visuals .
Guys will bring over those big , fat candy canes and want you to put it up your ass — or his ass , for that matter .
Particularly if they 've been drinking .
You do have to watch out for that on Christmas — guys who 've been hitting the eggnog all day . "
She shrugs .
" But the tips are usually good . "
When my friend Natalie was an escort we had weekly vent - about - work sessions over dinner .
She 's since left the business , but we still do weekly dinners , and she still has plenty of opinions about sex work .
" I may be a Jew , " Natalie said when I asked about her experiences on the holidays , " but I did n't work on Christmas .
The way I see it , if you 've got nothing else to do on Christmas , then you 're nobody I want to deal with .
All the good clients have other places to be . "
Even the Jewish ones ?
" Christmas is a secular holiday , too , now , " said Natalie , " not just a religious one .
Only weirdos and losers call on Christmas . "
Natalie has a point .
I 've been to Christmas gigs where it was clear that the guy was n't escaping from a family gathering — because he did n't have a family .
Some of them were contented loners , just looking to be entertained .
But some of them — well , Jae pretty much nails it :
" Sometimes you show up at the guy 's house on Christmas and you feel sorry for him , you know ?
Like there 's this sort of Charlie Brown - ish Christmas tree with one present under it , and it's for you . "
Now that 's sad .
I remember one particular Christmas client .
It was midafternoon on Christmas Eve .
The client and I had never met before , but I showed up at his house at the appointed time , and he quickly ushered me inside .
The man of the house was thin and pale , with faded blond hair , and he looked nervous .
I could understand why :
There 's a reason married guys rarely have whores come to their homes .
How could I tell he was married ?
Well , the fact that the house was decorated in a nauseatingly cutesy - country - crafty style was a big tip - off .
Not just decorated — the place was stuffed full of ruffled chintz and gingham , designer teddy bears and American primitive wooden plaques with bunnies and angels and hearts burned on them .
There was a flowered platter of homemade iced cookies sitting on the hall table .
And there were a lot of family portraits on the foyer wall , with Mom , Dad , and three little rug rats .
" So you can be gone by six , right ? " he asked .
" Sweetie , I 'll leave whenever you want , " I replied .
I paused before asking the obvious question .
" Is your wife coming home ? "
He nodded jerkily .
" She and the kids are at church . "
I could n't believe it .
This guy had a hooker come to his house on Christmas Eve while his wife and kids were at church ?
He is so going to hell for this , I thought , and I 'll undoubtedly see him there .
" Well , let 's not waste playtime , " I said , moving toward the stairs .
" Where would you like to ...? "
" No , not upstairs ! " he said , practically panicking .
" I do n't want to mess up the bed .
Let 's just — do it in the living room . "
Easier said than done .
We edged around the eight - foot Christmas tree that dominated the room and sat down on the powder - blue couch .
He handed me an envelope with the cash in it .
I tucked it into my purse and then looked at him , waiting for him to give me some sign of how he wanted to proceed .
But he just stared at me like a trapped rabbit .
The room was dim , and the lights from the tree threw alternating red and green splotches on his face .
The effect made him look like he had some kind of facial tic , and I doubted that it was enhancing my complexion , either .
" Okay , " I thought to myself , " if I have to be gone soon , I am going to have to take control of this fuck . "
I stripped down to my tarty black lace lingerie and stockings , got his pants around his knees , and started unrolling a condom onto his dick with my mouth .
He moaned and leaned back on the couch — and then we both gasped and jumped as the tinkling strains of " White Christmas " suddenly rose into the air .
He looked wildly around the room for a moment , then relaxed and said , " Oh , wait , it 's this pillow .
It 's got a music box in it , when you lean on it , it plays ... "
He fished a red - and - green throw pillow from behind his back and tossed it away .
It played on for a minute , before ceasing abruptly with a mechanical click .
He lay back again , but it seemed that our musical interruption had made his little Saint Nick unhappy .
Or maybe it's this house , I thought , as I sucked him .
It 's completely antisexual .
Interior decor as visual saltpeter .
I stood up , pulled off my panties , and bent over the couch .
I knew I should give him some dirty verbal encouragement , but my vast repertoire of porn talk had deserted me , and the best I could manage was a come - hither expression that felt as painted - on as the faces of the knee - high nutcrackers flanking the fireplace .
I watched him maneuver into position behind me in the gilt - framed , holly - draped mirror over the mantel .
In my black bra and stockings , I was jarringly out of place in the room , an affront to the relentless , smothering cozy cuteness .
It was hard to even breathe .
As he fumbled around behind me , the bowls of cloyingly sweet potpourri that sat on both end tables began to make my eyes water and my nose itch .
I was going to start sneezing uncontrollably in a minute , I thought , and my mascara was going to run down my face in black streaks .
It was like a Stephen King Christmas house , where it looks all sweet , but if you do n't behave , it kills you .
It certainly killed our date .
After 45 minutes of unsuccessful fumbling , he looked at the clock and announced that I should leave .
" Thanks anyway , " he said , holding the door open for me .
" And , uh — Merry Christmas .
Would you like a cookie ?
They 're gingerbread . "
Like any customer - service job , sometimes whoring is a breeze , sometimes it 's a grind .
But there 's one thing that always makes the season bright : the money .
Because Christmas — secular and otherwise — means presents , preferably expensive presents .
Every sex worker I know drops a lot of cash at Christmas .
Especially when she 's new enough to still be astonished by how much money she 's suddenly making .
The urge to share the wealth with your loved ones at Christmas is strong .
I was 19 the very first year I was working .
My mom had separated from my dad a few months before , and she was down about her first Christmas alone .
So I bought her a ton of presents — a VCR , obscenely expensive bed linens , and blue topaz earrings that matched her eyes .
After we opened them and she stopped crying , I took her to one of those ridiculously extravagant buffets with ice sculptures and hand - carved roast beef .
She cried a little more , and then we laughed at how silly it was and ate too much .
The Christmas I was 23 , my lover had just won custody of her two daughters , aged 4 and 6 , after a lengthy battle with their father .
She weighed her staggering legal bills against her low - paying job , and said to me , " I want to do what you do . "
The tricky thing was that Martina was a butch dyke , not exactly a sought - after look in the sex industry .
But under her auto - shop jumpsuit , she had long legs , a narrow waist and D - cup breasts , and with a little makeup , we figured we could femme her up enough to get by .
She grudgingly agreed to practice walking in high heels , but she flat - out refused to wear dresses .
We bleached her crew - cut hair platinum blond and told my agency to describe her as a Brigitte Nielsen type .
Martina did n't have much of a knack for the prefucking chitchat , but as she put it , " Once I can take those stupid girly clothes off , I 'm fine . "
A surprising number of guys found her unstudied tomboy manner quite attractive .
Martina took the cash and bought her two little girls so much stuff at Toys R
Us that she had to make two trips with the car to get it all home .
We could hardly see the tree on Christmas morning , with all the boxes stacked around it .
I have never seen two children so shiny - eyed with gratified toy lust .
" I would even wear a dress if I had to , " Martina told me later that morning , " just to see them happy . "
What do people mean when they speak disparagingly of " a whore " ?
Someone who sells her or his body ?
I have news for you :
Unless you 're a ghost who still draws a paycheck , you use your body to make a living , too .
Ever been nice to a customer you really did n't like , or acted enthusiastic about something you really did n't care about , just because you were getting paid ?
Congratulations , you 're a whore , too .
You 're just not getting paid as much as I am .
I got into sex work thinking , as everyone does , that it would be something I 'd do for a little while before I went on to a real career .
The culture of sex work was different then .
This was preinternet , and most sex workers were isolated from one another .
The popular media presented sex work as a one - way ticket to hell .
Clients and workers were both much warier , each fearing violence , disease , or exposure at the hands of the other .
I dealt with a lot of disapproval from friends and lovers who I came out to .
In spite of all that , somewhere along the way , I realized I wanted sex work to be my real career .
I liked the money , I liked the independence , and I liked using my sexual skills .
There 's still a lot of stigma .
Even now , my mother would be distressed if I gave her exact details of what I did to get the money I used to buy her all those gifts .
Martina 's daughters might be disgusted to find out their mother was once a call girl .
But the world of sex work looks very different now .
The lonely - whore stereotype has been replaced by the hooker who snags a book deal by blogging about her exploits .
Buyers and sellers talk to each other and among themselves online ; escort - review websites allow clients and whores to hold each other accountable .
Since everyone is a bit less fearful , we 're all a bit more relaxed and kind and human with each other .
When I first began working , I usually saw a client only once , maybe twice .
Now I have guys who I 've been seeing frequently for years .
The relationships have their boundaries , but I am my real self when I am with them , and they are my friends as well as my clients .
The vast increase in the visibility and dialogue of real sex workers has changed my nonworking life as well .
The misconceptions that I have to overcome on a daily basis have gone from massive to manageable .
I have sex - worker pals who I can talk to when things get stressful .
I have two committed partners who love me and understand and support my career .
And I have a wide circle of friends who think I 'm a good person .
My family ?
Well , I 'm still the black sheep , but they love me anyway .
I am about as far as you can get from lonely , at Christmas or any other time of the year .
I 'm not on the run from any big holiday parties this year , so I 'll be spending a mellow Christmas at home with my lovers .
If you 're a sex worker doing dates on December 25 , I wish you happy clients , heavy tips , and an equally sweet Christmas of your own to go home to .
Ho , ho , ho .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Supreme Court justices on Wednesday questioned whether terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay have constitutional grounds for challenging their years - long detention , in a major case spotlighting the tarnished U.S. human - rights record .
The lawyer representing 37 Guantanamo inmates argued before the highest U.S. court that Congress wrongly stripped the prisoners in 2006 of their habeas corpus rights to seek a judicial review of their detention .
Justices asked whether Congress had created an adequate alternative for prisoners to contest their detention , and whether the Constitution protects the rights of foreigners held by the United States outside the country .
“ If our law does n’t apply , this is a law - free zone , ” detainee attorney Seth Waxman told the court , referring to the prison at the U.S. Naval base on Cuba .
Centuries of U.S. and English legal tradition were examined in the court ’s oral arguments .
The case is being watched by governments and activists around the world , who say President George W. Bush has overreached his powers and trampled on human rights in the war on terrorism he launched after the September 11 attacks .
A handful of protesters outside the court wore orange prison - style jumpsuits with black hoods and chanted “ equal justice under law , defend the Constitution . ”
Many prisoners have been kept at Guantanamo for nearly six years while courts and the military wrangled over their cases , Waxman told the court .
“ The time for experimentation is over . ”
The Bush administration contends the detentions are lawful , humane and necessary in a new - style war on terrorism .
Justice Department Solicitor General Paul Clement , arguing the administration ’s case , said the prisoners have more rights now than under original U.S. habeas corpus law in 1789 .
“ This is a remarkable liberalization , ” he said .
ZEROING IN
The court ’s arguments ran about 22 minutes over the scheduled one hour .
A decision is expected by summer .
Chief Justice John Roberts zeroed in on an issue some have said would be the crux of the case , whether the 2006 law which allowed for a limited review by a federal appeals court in Washington offered the detainees an adequate alternative to make their case in court .
“ So our judgment in this case depends on whether we agree with you , or the government , that the ( alternative ) procedures ... are meaningful ? ” Roberts asked Waxman , who said yes .

Justice Anthony Kennedy , a swing vote , asked whether the appeals court in Washington should not first rule on whether the alternative process was adequate .
The appeals court did not rule on the issue when it decided against the detainees in the case the court heard on Wednesday .
The high court has ruled against the administration in two previous Guantanamo cases and one other terrorism case .
But Congress adopted new measures including the 2006 law aimed at keeping such cases out of court by removing the prisoners ’ habeas corpus rights under federal law .
This is the first time the court is considering whether the Guantanamo prisoners have those rights under the Constitution itself .
But some justices suggested the court ’s earlier rulings meant they do .
“ We passed that point , have n’t we ? ” Justice David Souter asked .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
The Guantanamo prison opened in January 2002 after the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan .
The administration contends the naval base , on land leased from Cuba , is outside U.S. territory so constitutional protections do not apply .
Justice Antonin Scalia pressed Waxman for historical examples of habeas corpus rights extending to foreign prisoners held outside the United States or England , the source of U.S. habeas corpus law .
He disputed examples cited by Waxman .
Most of the 305 prisoners at Guantanamo have been confined for years without charges and many have complained of abuse .
Bush has acknowledged the prison ’s damage to the U.S. image and said he would like to see it closed eventually .
About 470 prisoners have been released , and the United States said it intends to try 60 to 80 of those still in detention .
Also on Wednesday , a Guantanamo tribunal began a hearing in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , an accused guard for Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
REDMOND , Wash .
- Consistent with the theme that dynamic languages can be used for general - purpose applications , Resolver Systems is introducing a spreadsheet written in Python .
At the Lang.NET conference on the Microsoft campus here Jan. 29 , Giles Thomas , chief technology officer at London - based Resolver Systems , demonstrated Resolver One , a spreadsheet written in Python .
Thomas said Resolver
One not only is a simple spreadsheet , but a spreadsheet developed as an IronPython program .
IronPython is Microsoft 's implementation of the Python dynamic language implemented to run on .
Net .
The goal of Resolver was also to put a simple yet powerful programming tool into the hands of end users , he said .
" We wanted to raise the bar for what was possible with end user - generated programs , " he said .
Because a Resolver document is both a spreadsheet and a computer program , " the numerical data remains separate from the logic which operates on it , " said a description of the technology on Resolver Systems '
Web site .
" Resolver spreadsheets make it possible for business users to develop a spreadsheet as usual , and for IT to instantly extract their algorithms and use them in more complex systems . "
Thomas said the company released version 1.0 of Resolver One Jan. 16 .
" We wanted to fill the gap between a spreadsheet and a full - fledged programming tool , " he said .
Thomas said Resolver Systems practices Extreme Programming and does test - first development .
" Dynamic languages are perfect for test - first programming , " he said .
Meanwhile , Thomas said his team decided to build Resolver One in IronPython because of its " dynamic features and the readability of Python . "
The company initially started out with a plan to build a .
Net program embedding some dynamic language functionality using extreme programming , he said .
" Originally we thought we'd do it in C# , but we saw IronPython and it looked good , " Thomas said .
" We realized that extreme programming made static typing less important , so we decided to see how far we could get before switching to C# . "
For the more than nine years that Ars Technica has been publishing online , we 've been outspoken when it comes to the lack of balance between the threat of piracy ( which is always overstated ) and the " solutions " to piracy ( which are often draconian ) that some copyright holders demand .
Whether it's laws that would turn the possession of software into a crime , completely baked piracy reports , or yet another law meant to criminalize civil infractions , we 've cast a critical eye on an industry that defines solipsism .
And , everyone once and while , we 're accused of hyperbole — of exaggerating our objections .
That 's why it's with both a grin and a lonely tear that I report to you the latest ridiculous claim from the copyright - trumps - all brigade .
NBC / Universal general counsel Rick Cotton suggests that society wastes entirely too much money policing crimes like burglary , fraud , and bank - robbing when it should be doing something about piracy instead .
" Our law enforcement resources are seriously misaligned , " Cotton said .
" If you add up all the various kinds of property crimes in this country , everything from theft , to fraud , to burglary , bank - robbing , all of it , it costs the country $ 16 billion a year .
But intellectual property crime runs to hundreds of billions [ of dollars ] a year . "
Cotton 's comments come in Paul Sweeting 's report on Hollywood 's latest shenanigans on Capitol Hill .
There are two obvious rejoinders to such a ridiculous statement .
The first is that " hundreds of billions of dollars a year " is a myth .
The MPAA 's own cherry - picked study from Smith Barney in 2005 put their annual loss at less than $ 6 billion , and while the music and software industries also like to publish trumped - up claims , the figures are nowhere near hundreds of billions of dollars each year .
The second objection , of course , is that the traditional crimes Cotton describes often involve the destruction of people 's lives along with property .
Burglaries can result in homicide , as can fraud ( ask the preacher 's wife ) , while bank robbery is , without a doubt , a dangerous game .
Those crimes also typically involve real property .
For better or for worse , real property should not be confused with intellectual property , which is not subject to the same rules of scarcity .
Stopping a bank heist is , without a doubt , a far more important matter than stopping the bootlegging of Gigli or Spider - Man 3 .
Chances are you would prefer that the cops spend their efforts protecting people from rampant home burglaries than chasing down kids with pirated music on their iPods .
Regardless , Cotton and his Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy are seeking to change federal law enforcement emphasis so that intellectual property crimes are given priority over other kinds of crime ... a realignment , to play off Cotton 's statement .
Battling organized crime is hardly objectionable , and we hope the coalition sees success in taking down the profiteers of piracy .
Offending the public with yet more lies and hyperbole is n't going to curry much favor , however .
the obstacles that prevent the Internet from being available to
should enjoy such abundant access to this rich resource while billions

On the downside , I think he ’d be a terrible president .
He does n’t know beans about foreign affairs , he wants to replace the income tax with a national sales tax , and his positions on social issues are far to the right of the general populace .
But why are n’t the social conservatives rallying around this guy ?
Unlike any of the major candidates , he ’s still on his first wife and first position on abortion .
Once we start getting into the inevitable personal stories of redemption , Americans would have a much better time listening to Huckabee tell how he lost 110 pounds than sitting through Rudy ’s 9/11 story again or looking at pictures of Mitt ’s 10 grandchildren .

Yet the leaders of the Values Voters keep waiting for one of the top - tier candidates to change — a strategy that any woman who ’s had an unsatisfactory boyfriend could warn them is never going to pan out .
They pace around muttering that maybe Fred Thompson will start acting more ... alive , or that Mitt Romney will stop being a Mormon .
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , seems to think Rudy Giuliani has come around on gay marriage .
( Perkins should talk to Rudy ’s gay former roommate Howard Koeppel about the time the then - mayor promised to marry Koeppel and his partner as soon as the laws change . )
Huckabee ’s problems say more about the leaders of the religious right than about him .
They ’re united mainly by their hatred of abortion and gay marriage , and a desire to win .
Considerations like who has the most Christian attitudes toward illegal immigrants do n’t register .
And the fact that as governor Huckabee spent a lot of time trying to spend money on the needy does n’t go over all that well with the ones who believe that God ’s top priority is eliminating the estate tax .
Lately , anti-Huckabee conservatives have been suggesting he ’s soft on crime .
The story involves an Arkansas man , Wayne DuMond , who was accused of kidnapping and raping a high school cheerleader in 1985 .
While he was free awaiting trial , masked men broke into his home , beat and castrated him .
His testicles wound up in a jar of formaldehyde , on display on the desk of the local sheriff .
At the trial , he was sentenced to life plus 20 years .
When Huckabee became governor , DuMond was still in an apparently hopeless situation , though theoretically eligible for parole .
Huckabee championed his cause , and wrote him a congratulatory letter when he was finally released in 1999 .
Then in 2000 DuMond moved to Kansas City , where he sexually assaulted and murdered a woman who lived near his home .

China has banned fire department officials from receiving sexual favors as bribes from companies seeking their business , local media reported on Friday .
REUTERS / Nir Elias
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has banned fire department officials from receiving sexual favors as bribes from companies seeking their business , local media reported on Friday .
Fire department officials were also banned from letting their spouses and children run fire - fighting companies and market fire - fighting products , part of an anti-corruption drive outlined in a notice posted on the Public Security ministry Web site .
Apart from taking cash and “ other valuables , ” the order forbade officials from receiving “ cheap or free house renovations , ” “ having children entered into schools ” and “ receiving sexual services ” provided by third parties .
“ We must remind ourselves that we cannot ignore the problems regarding the opportunism of a minority of officials when enforcing the law , ” the notice said .
A commentary carried by the official Xinhua news agency on Friday praised the order -- officially abbreviated as the “ Four Strictly Forbiddens ” -- as timely .
“ For every 10 corrupt officials , nine are involved in illicit sex .
This old tune has already been proved by statistics from disciplinary organs many times , ” Xinhua said .
“ The people believe that the trade of authority for sex is still comparatively serious , ” the commentary said .

In recent weeks , the Chinese have been accused not only of hacking the Pentagon , but also several German ministries and key sites in the UK , as well .
In doing research for an upcoming story on the Pentagon attacks , I stumbled upon recent reports in Germany of surprisingly similar activity .
Germany 's Federal Office for Information has identified malicious trojan - based attacks on government computers , attacks which some members of the German government say appear to originate from within the Chinese Army .
The story was first reported by German - language newspaper Spiegel Online , which said that investigators had found evidence of " Chinese espionage programs " on computers in several government agencies , including the office of German chancellor Angela Merkel .
Federal Office for Information Security experts discovered the first spyware trojans months ago and successfully thwarted the transfer of over 160 GB of data , according to the report .
Chinese officials in Berlin originally criticized the finding as irresponsible speculation when it debuted late last month , but as the drama unfolds , that tune is changing .
Following the accusations , Chinese premier Wen Jiabao told reporters that he was " gravely concerned " over the claims .
" We in the government took ( the reports ) as a matter of grave concern .
Hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world , " Wen said in a statement to reporters .
The attacks come at the same time that China finds itself accused of hacking the Pentagon .
China has denied these allegations : a foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC " some people are making wild accusations against China ...
These are totally groundless and also reflect a Cold War mentality . "
Yet as the accusations pile up , it is becoming harder to ignore .
The UK's Times Online reported last week that China has also been identified trying to compromise security on government and military computer systems there .
In Germany , the issue of electronic spying is n't just limited to China .
Hartwig Möller , head of the constitutional protection authorities in North Rhine - Westphalia , said that Iran has also recently attempted to infiltrate systems to obtain information on nuclear programs , according to Heise .
Nevertheless , all eyes are on China , now that three major players in the global economy have said that the country is almost certainly engaging in computer - based espionage .
Olbermann : Huckabee gay marriage attack also dig at Romney David Edwards and Muriel Kane

This A leading Republican presidential candidate may have managed a subtle swipe against one of his rivals when he compared homosexuality to practices like bestiality , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann quipped on Thursday night .
Olbermann began by recalling Mike Huckabee 's suggestion earlier this week that we need " to amend the Constitution so it 's in God 's standards . "
" First he wanted the Constitution revised to line up with the Bible , " Olberman stated , " a construction so bizarre that even an interviewer at Beliefnet.com said , ' Some people would consider that a kind of dangerous undertaking , particularly given the variety of Biblical interpretations . '
To which the Huckster answered , he does n't think it 's radical .
' The radical view is to say we 're going to change the definition so that it can mean two men , two women , a man and three women , a man and a child , a man -- an animal . ' "
" Here we go , " Olbermann noted wearily .
" Two men getting married is the same as pedophilia or bestiality .
The same blinkered irrationality that got Rick Santorum run out of the Senate . "
Huckabee 's remarks have provided an easy target for snarky comments from blogs such as Shakespeare 's Sister , which wrote " Shut the fuck up , you crazy , ignorant , despicable bigot .
You 've got a brain of mush and a heart of stone and if you can't understand the easily discernible difference between a relationship involving consenting adults whose bedroom activities impinge on no one else 's rights , and a pathological sexuality in which the notion of consent is wholly absent , then you are too stupid to be president . "
Olbermann , however , saw an opportunity to make better use of Huckabee 's remark , which referenced not only bestiality but also polygamy -- a practice sanctioned until 1890 by the Mormon Church , of which his rival Mitt Romney is a member .
" But a man and three women ? " Olbermann concluded , smirking broadly and giving Huckabee a thumbs - up .
" Nice drive - by swipe at the Romney family tree ! "

Let 's start by enforcing all those international mandates calling for justice in Israel / Palestine -- the Geneva conventions and all that .
And while we 're at it , let 's make all the laws in Israel / Palestine apply equally to Palestinians and Israelis both .
If Palestinians need 200 signatures to get a building permit , let 's have Israelis need 200 signatures too !
Then let 's turn Israel into an actual democracy by giving the vote to EVERYONE in Israel / Palestine -- and giving everyone equal education opportunities too .
PhDs for all .
And let 's abolish all those Israeli neo-con Jim Crow laws against " non-believers " .
( Did you know that in Israel today , a non-believer is not a non-Jew .
In Israel today , a non-believer is simply anyone who does n't believe that God gave Israel to the Israeli neo-cons !
In Israel today , you can be an Orthodox Jew , keep Kosher , have faith in the G-d of the Torah and still be considered a non-believer .
Is n't that a bit weird ? )
And if a Palestinian has to sit for six hours at a checkpoint and carry ID papers at all times , then let 's have Israelis sit at checkpoints for six hours and carry ID papers at all times too .
" And every time an Israeli kills a Palestinian child in cold blood , then a Palestinian gets to .... "
Oops , forget about that one .
Palestinians would have to spend too much time killing Israeli children to even that score .
And besides , we are striving toward justice , non-violence and WWJD here .
And Jesus definitely would NOT do that !
And then let 's tear down the actual physical wall between Bethlehem and Jerusalem .
You just know that this is what Jesus would have done .
He would n't have wanted to walk through all those checkpoints on his way to visit the Temple or go home to Bethlehem to visit His mom .
You can [ West B ]ank on that !
But what is actually happening here is that I have lured you into reading this essay under false pretenses , using lurid headlines about Jesus liberating Bethlehem as bait in order to talk about something else -- something even more important .
Israel and Palestine are on the other side of the world .
Sure , I care about what is going on over there .
But I care about what is going on here in America a hecka lot more .
Why ?
Because I live here , not there .
I 'm selfish that way .
Get over it .
That 's a no-brainer .
" John McCain . "
Who do you think is going to win the 2008 presidential election in November ?
John McCain , of course .
I just got an e-mail from Sterling Greenwood , the editor of the Aspen Free Press .
Greenwood is a bona fide member of the Hunter S. Thompson school of Gonzo journalism -- Gonzo journalism is making a comeback by the way because us bloggers can actually say what we want online .
We do n't need no stinking badges !
The corporate media hates us .
But we have ALL THE FUN .
Us and Jack Kerouac and Mark Twain and Molly Ivins .
But I digress .
" Can you believe , " e-mailed Greewood , " that John McCain is being trumpeted as a possible GOP front - runner because he won South Carolina ?
No one mentions that some sixty - seven percent of the voters in that state voted against him . "
That 's right .
Most people split their vote between Huckabee and Thompson because they were all pissed off with McCain because of his pro-globalization immigration stance .
Much of South Carolina 's textile industry was out - sourced to Latin America on McCain 's watch .
Even South Carolina did n't like McCain .
But he will still be our next President .
" Not only that , " continued Greenwood , " but on the same day that McCain won South Carolina , " -- sort of -- " he came in third in Nevada behind Mitt Romney and Ron Paul . "
What ?
McCain can't even beat Ron Paul ?
" Plus earlier McCain came in fourth in Iowa behind Huckabee , Romney and Thompson .
And McCain also got trounced in Michigan by Romney and did n't come up to scratch in Wyoming either . "
Greenwood does present a good case that McCain might be a loser .
So WHY are we being stuck with him ?
Probably for the same reason that the spiritual tradition of Jesus is being ignored and He is being stuck with The Wall .
" War " produces pork .
Idealism does not .
" Granted , " went on the editor , " John McCain won New Hampshire but figure this :
If Hilliary Clinton had lost as often as McCain has , the talking heads on TV would have long since have buried her candidacy .
But the TV - heads were all set to tout McCain as having ' big mo ' if he 'd even finished Iowa as high as third .
Gimmie a break ! "
Sorry , Gonzo .
No break for you .
John McCain -- not Hillary or Obama or Edwards ( and certainly not Kucinich , Richardson , Paul or Gravel ! ) -- is headed toward sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom , rolling Easter eggs on the White House lawn and cruising around in Air Force One .
" But why John McCain ? " you might well ask .
Because of who he is and what he does .
I 'm currently reading Terry Pratchett 's latest novel , " Making Money , " and it is about the actual physical act of MAKING money -- wherein our hero , Moist Von Lipwig , goes off to work at the Ankh - Morpork mint .
And said money is being turned out by golems , those ceaseless hard workers who never stop working for their masters .
Well .
John McCain is a hard - working golem too -- working tirelessly night and day to turn out money for the weapons industry .
And from sad past experience with the elections of 2000 and 2004 , we have all learned the hard way that corporations like General Electric , Lockheed , Raytheon and Halliburton get to pick the next President .
Not us .
Ergo .
Thus .
Here 's my conclusion :
In 2008 , somehow or other , John McCain will get shoved down our throats .
John McCain WILL be our next President .
He 's as good as sitting in the Oval Office right now .
And the aforementioned throat - shoving has already begun .
American voters have even started to overcome their gag - reflexes already .
" McCain is a centrist , " they are already starting to chant .
" He is a uniter . "
Now where have we heard that one before ?

I once thought I had traveled a unique career path .
Graduating from college with a degree in computer engineering and electrical engineering I was on fire to be a manager .
My dad had worked for the same electrical contractor for 30 - something years and I knew everyone from the Chairman of the Board down to the woman who worked the front desk .
I had a major “ in ” and was quickly shuffled into a management training program , with my sights set on one day becoming CEO of the $ 600 million firm .
18 months later I left for a job writing software for a dot com in Sacramento , and within 3 months I was running multiple project teams ( albeit , small ones ) .
I was young , it was fast paced , and I loved it .
When that company experienced difficult times in 2001 , I transitioned into contracting , which I did for about three years before taking a position as the Application Development and Database Supervisor at the City of Pasadena , directly responsible for the management and supervision of 10 developers and DBAs .
The prestige ?
High .
The paycheck ?
Fat .
The job ?
Hated it .
I could n’t get past a number of issues with this “ perfect ” position , namely that I could n’t hire and fire as I pleased , our technology was dated , and it took movement from the hand of God himself to be able to write a few lines of code .
On a side note , many of the people I worked with at the City were very good to work with and knew how to do their jobs .
Pasadena is one of the most progressive cities in the state , if not the country , in terms of technology .
But the job did n’t fit me and I started to interview elsewhere .
By this time I was burned out on managing people and knew what I wanted to do : write code .
“ Do you want to manage ? ”
Nope , I want to write code .
“ Do you want to run a team ? ”
Nope , write code .
“ Do Architecture ? ”
Write code .
“ Talk to your co-workers ? ”
CODE !
During this time an interviewer asked me “ Where do you see yourself in five years ? ” and my answer was “ I just want to write code .
I do n’t want to manage people .
I ’ve been there and I did n’t enjoy it .
I want to get back to learning .NET and come up for air in about 3 months . ”
And code I did .
I arrived in the morning , threw on my headphones and wrote mad stacks of functionality .
I produced more software in 6 months than I had in the previous year .
It was a fun time and I look back on it with fondness , if not a bit of envy .
But I was naive to think I could continue doing that for very long .
After 6 months I was asked to run a project .
I accepted and what started as a two - person team evolved into 10 developers cranking on the largest software project our company had every undertaken .
And I was at the helm .
During this time I did n’t write a line of code for 15 months , but my Visio skills were like nothing you can imagine .
I knew every keyboard shortcut and every right - click .
I saw Visio shapes attacking me in my dreams and I knew the exact mouse movements and clicks to re-size them so they could do me no harm .
I left the company within a year of completing that project .
I had voiced my – lets call them concerns – many times but the “ good of the project ” always overruled my desire to return to writing code .
After nearly a year of asking to return to the battlefield , I turned in my badge and made my way back to the world of consulting .
I discovered that although I enjoy running small teams , I have an innate desire to create .
And unfortunately , while managing people requires creativity , it does not allow you to create .
Although my teams and bosses liked me and my results , it did not fulfill deep need to take dead bits and make them into something living .
We ’re Not Alone
Within the last year I ’ve heard nearly identical stories from four five other developers whom I ’ve known for many years .
One friend , while telling me his tale of being forced into project management , described a conversation where he told his manager “ I just want to code . ”
I laughed out loud at his word - for - word use of what had become my mantra for the past 15 months .
Another friend of mine said :
“ I feel I may be on a similar track to what you ’ve traveled , starting from a developer and moving into project oversight on a $ 1 Billion project .
Maybe one day I could be a programmer again , having come full circle .
Programmers are not bottom feeders but something to aspire to , even for people who are currently managers , not just for college grads looking for entry level positions .
Working my way ‘ down ’ to a programmer might work my way back to a place I really enjoyed and have fond memories of .
Instead of reverse engineering it ’s sort of a reverse career track . ”
I imagine there are more stories where these came from .
Why It ’s Bad
Promoting developers into management or project management is not bad .
On the contrary , I have most enjoyed working for managers who at one time in their career made the 1’s and 0 ’s dance .
The problem is not that developers are promoted , it ’s that the developers who tend to be promoted are the “ big producers , ” the ones who come through on their projects .
These are the same developers who stay late and read software books on the weekend because of their love for programming ; that ’s why they come through on their projects .
Promoting someone who loves to write software into a position where they will write little or no software does n’t make an ounce of sense .
Someone else said this first , but if Willie Mays played for your baseball team would you promote him to manager ?
True , he delivers more than his teammates , and he is one of the best players of all time , but a player of that caliber should be left where he can do the most good : smacking balls out of the park .
Moving him into manager not only reduces his direct contribution to the team , but is done under the assumption that he has a clue how to manage his fellow players , instead of what he ’s obviously demonstrated he can do : hit a baseball like few people in history have .
The answer ?
Promote developers who demonstrate management skills instead of top notch development skills .
They may be hard to find , but top notch developers are even harder to find .
The end result of promoting your best developers is at best a few unhappy months or years as they struggle with their unhappiness and their desire to return to code , while ( perhaps ) not wanting to disappoint you .
The worst case is they feel unbridled resentment as you watch them rush out the door like there were a 70 % - off sale at Barnes & Noble .
Why We Fall for It
Every developer I ’ve talked to said the same thing : they went into management for the prestige , the money , pressure from their bosses or upper management , and not wanting to “ stir the pot . ”
Perhaps it ’s the fact that the best developers I know are easy to get along with , good listeners , and generally pleasant to work with .
Hence , when a manager or executive asks them to run a huge project they take it as a challenge and a compliment .
It ’s not until 10 months later when they ’ve lost their ability to write a while loop that they realize they may have made a mistake .
If you find yourself in management and wish you were coding , do n’t wait until you ’re completely burned out and bitter ; do yourself ( and your company ) a favor – and do it now .
Get yourself back into the code jockey seat .
If your current company wo n’t work with you , there are companies out there who will .
The big world of classical physics mostly seems sensible : waves are waves and particles are particles , and the moon rises whether anyone watches or not .
The tiny quantum world is different : particles are waves ( and vice versa ) , and quantum systems remain in a state of multiple possibilities until they are measured — which amounts to an intrusion by an observer from the big world — and forced to choose : the exact position or momentum of an electron , say .
On what scale do the quantum world and the classical world begin to cross into each other ?
How big does an " observer " have to be ?
It 's a long - argued question of fundamental scientific interest and practical importance as well , with significant implications for attempts to build solid - state quantum computers .
Researchers at the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and their collaborators at the University of Frankfurt , Germany ; Kansas State University ; and Auburn University have now established that quantum particles start behaving in a classical way on a scale as small as a single hydrogen molecule .
They reached this conclusion after performing what they call the world 's simplest — and certainly its smallest — double slit experiment , using as their two " slits " the two proton nuclei of a hydrogen molecule , only 1.4 atomic units apart ( a few ten - billionths of a meter ) .
Their results appear in the November 9 , 2007 issue of Science .
Double slit experiment
" One of the most powerful ways to explore the quantum world is the double slit experiment , " says Ali Belkacem of Berkeley Lab's Chemical Sciences Division , one of the research leaders .
In its familiar form , the double slit experiment uses a single light source shining through two slits , side by side in an opaque screen ; the light that passes through falls on a screen .
If either of the two slits is closed , the light going through the other slit forms a bright bar on the screen , striking the screen like a stream of BBs or Ping - Pong balls or other solid particles .
But if both slits are open , the beams overlap to form interference fringes , just as waves in water do , with bright bands where the wavecrests reinforce one another and dark bands where they cancel .
So is light particles or waves ?
The ambiguous results of early double slit experiments ( the first on record was in 1801 ) were not resolved until well into the 20th century , when it became clear from both experiment and the theory of quantum mechanics that light is both waves and particles — moreover , that particles , including electrons , also have a wave nature .

" It 's the wave nature of electrons that allows them to act in a correlated way in a hydrogen molecule , " says Thorsten Weber of the Chemical Sciences Division , another of the experiment 's leading researchers .
" When two particles are part of the same quantum system , their interactions are not restricted to electromagnetism , for example , or gravity .
They also possess quantum coherence — they share information about their states nonlocally , even when separated by arbitrary distances . "
Correlation between its two electrons is actually what makes double photoionization possible with a hydrogen molecule .
Photoionization means that an energetic photon , in this case an x-ray , knocks an electron out of an atom or molecule , leaving the system with net charge ( ionized ) ; in double photoionization a single photon triggers the emission of two electrons .
" The photon hits only one electron , but because they are correlated , because they cohere in the quantum sense , the electron that 's hit flies off in one direction with a certain momentum , and the other electron also flies off at a specific angle to it with a different momentum , " Weber explains .
The experimental set - up used by Belkacem and Weber and their colleagues , being movable , was employed on both beamlines 4.0 and 11.0 of Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source ( ALS ) .
In the apparatus a stream of hydrogen gas is sent through an interaction region , where some of the molecules are struck by an x-ray beam from the ALS .
When the two negatively charged electrons are knocked out of a molecule , the two positively charged protons ( the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms ) blow themselves apart by mutual repulsion .
An electric field in the experiment 's interaction region separates the positively and negatively charged particles , sending the protons to one detector and the electrons to a detector in the opposite direction .
" It 's what 's called a kinematically complete experiment , " Belkacem says , " one in which every particle is accounted for .
We can determine the momentum of all the particles , the initial orientation and distance between the protons , and the momentum of the electrons . "
What the simplest double slit experiment reveals
advertisement
" At the high photon energies we used for photoionization , most of the time we observed one fast electron and one slow electron , " says Weber .
" What we were interested in was the interference patterns . "
Considered as particles , the electrons fly off at an angle to one another that depends on their energy and how they scatter from the two hydrogen nuclei ( the " double slit " ) .
Considered as waves , an electron makes an interference pattern that can be seen by calculating the probability that the electron will be found at a given position relative to the orientation of the two nuclei .
The wave nature of the electron means that in a double slit experiment even a single electron is capable of interfering with itself .
Double slit experiments with photoionized hydrogen molecules at first showed only the self - interference patterns of the fast electrons , their waves bouncing off both protons , with little action from the slow electrons .
" From these patterns , it might look like the slow electron is not important , that double photoionization is pretty unspectacular , " says Weber .
The fast electrons ' energies were 185 to 190 eV ( electron volts ) , while the slow electrons had energies of 5 eV or less .
But what happens if the slow electron is given just a bit more energy , say somewhere between 5 and 25 eV ?
As Weber puts it , " What if we make the slow electron a little more active ?
What if we turn it into an ' observer ? ' "
As long as both electrons are isolated from their surroundings , quantum coherence prevails , as revealed by the fast electron 's wavelike interference pattern .
But this interference pattern disappears when the slow electron is made into an observer of the fast one , a stand - in for the larger environment : the quantum system of the fast electron now interacts with the wider world ( e.g. , its next neighboring particle , the slow electron ) and begins to decohere .
The system has entered the realm of classical physics .
Not completely , however .
And here is what Belkacem calls " the meat of the experiment : " " Even when the interference pattern has disappeared , we can see that coherence is still there , hidden in the entanglement between the two electrons . "
Although one electron has become entangled with its environment , the two electrons are still entangled with each other in a way that allows interference between them to be reconstructed , simply by graphing their correlated momenta from the angles at which the electrons were ejected .
Two waveforms appear in the graph , either of which can be projected to show an interference pattern .
But the two waveforms are out of phase with each other : viewed simultaneously , interference vanishes .
If the two - electron system is split into its subsytems and one ( the " observer " ) is thought of as the environment of the other , it becomes evident that classical properties such as loss of coherence can emerge even when only four particles ( two electrons , two protons ) are involved .
Yet because the two electron subsystems are entangled in a tractable way , their quantum coherence can be reconstructed .
What Weber calls " the which - way information exchanged between the particles " persists .
Says Belkacem , " For researchers who are trying to build solid - state quantum computers this is both good news and bad news .
The bad news is that decoherence and loss of information occur on the very tiny scale of a single hydrogen molecule .
The good news is that , theoretically , the information is n't necessarily lost — or at least not completely . "

BBC News , Shanghai
China 's new middle class usually tends to stay out of politics Rarely have protests in China been so well organised , or the protesters so well - dressed .
The residents of Pingyang district , in the south of the city , say their health is at risk and their homes will become worthless if a planned extension to Shanghai 's futuristic maglev railway goes ahead .
They are part of China 's new middle class .
Many of them bought their first homes here , capitalising on China 's new economic freedoms .
The government is considering a 30 km ( 19 - mile ) extension to its showpiece magnetic levitation train .
The train , which floats on magnets , is the fastest commercial train service in the world , travelling at 430 km / h ( 267 m ph ) .
But local residents along the route - including those in Pingyang - say the electro - magnetic field is dangerous and that their homes are now impossible to sell .
" Real estate agents wo n't come near now ; we 'll lose everything if this goes ahead , " said one woman who did not wish to give her name for fear of official reprisal .
" We 're prepared to take the risk , because our health , and a safe living environment , is more important , " she said .
' White elephant '
The maglev is a controversial project .
The original $ 1.4bn ( £ 715 m ) line runs from Shanghai 's international airport to the outskirts of the city .
Shanghai protest broken up Despite its incredible speed , it is poorly connected to the rest of the transport network and it is often quicker to travel by taxi than use the maglev .
Critics say the project is a white elephant and the government would be better spending its money on improving the city 's ageing fleet of buses .
China is a country with little patience for dissent .
But in a little over a week , Pingyang residents and their neighbours have marched through the city , chanting and waving slogans .
At the weekend many hundreds of them took their complaints to Shanghai 's city hall - the seat of communist power .
Dragged and shoved
The largely middle class protesters are keen to downplay any political aspect of their defiance .
They insist on calling their well - organised marches " going for a walk " events .
Protests in China usually come from the landless and the poor .
It is rare for China 's newly rich middle class to take to the streets .
Many have struck a bargain : in exchange for their new wealth , they stay out of politics .
These protests are organised using email and text messages Largely ignored by official state media , the protesters are using their sophisticated organisational skills to grab what attention they can .
Within minutes of our arrival in the neighbourhood , a couple of hundred people had gathered , marshalled by text message and email .
And although the " walks " are centred on a single issue , they are unmistakable acts of defiance .
On Saturday , dozens of demonstrators were detained by police .
The next day others were dragged and shoved when they took their protest to a busy shopping street .
Residents in the areas affected by the planned extension complain that local officials and police are trying to intimidate them , and that the government has set up video cameras to monitor activities in their neighbourhood .
Boundaries tested
The protests are the biggest Shanghai has seen since the anti-Japanese protests of 2005 .
Then , thousands of people , many of them students , demonstrated against Japan 's perceived failure to apologise for its war record .
However , those demonstrations , unlike the maglev protests , had tacit government approval .
How can we go through official channels ?
There is no proper process
Protester Around the Pingyang neighbourhood , police had come and removed their anti-maglev banners , replacing them with official - looking slogans that instructed them to make their protests " through proper channels " .
But China is a country where laws are still being written and where there are few checks and balances against the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party .
People have gained greater economic freedom under the government 's opening up process , but they do n't have the political and legal rights to match .
" The email address they have given us is n't even a government address , it 's a private email .
So how can we go through official channels ?
There is no proper process , " explained one man .
Others complained that the consultation period for the train line had been too short or lacked transparency .
The government says it will meet representatives from the neighbourhoods and that a final decision has yet to be taken on the project .
As well as the e-mail address , it has also set up a hotline to listen to people 's complaints .
Protesters ' victory The Shanghai protesters have taken comfort from other public protests in China .
Last June , protests in Xiamen , Fujian province , are believed to have led the local government to drop plans to build a chemical plant , because of health risks .
The Xiamen decision has been hailed as a victory for people power in China and has featured widely in state media .
The local residents in Pingyang are putting their faith in this new " listening communism " - one that promises to be more responsive and less corrupt by paying attention to people 's complaints .
" We love our government , we just want them to listen , and we 'll keep marching until they do , " a local resident said .

What are these ?
Tom Cruise 's biographer , for all his embarrassing revelations about the Hollywood actor 's fervor for Scientology , does n't give much credence to the longstanding rumors that the movie star is gay .
Tom Cruise is a " conventional , heterosexual man who , more interestingly , never wants to be alone , " writer Andrew Morton tells US Weekly .
But that 's not the conclusion that a close watcher of Cruise 's movies might come to .
Quentin Tarantino , in Sleep With Me , found homoerotic undertones in the glances between Cruise and Val Kilmer in Top Gun .
We see gay , everywhere .
So , here it is , the video that the Scientologists really did n't want you to see : Tom Cruise on Tom Cruise , Homoeroticist .
It 's funny .
Watch it .
ANAND , India 
Every night in this quiet western Indian city , 15 pregnant women prepare for sleep in the spacious house they share , ascending the stairs in a procession of ballooned bellies , to bedrooms that become a landscape of soft hills .
A team of maids , cooks and doctors looks after the women , whose pregnancies would be unusual anywhere else but are common here .
The young mothers of Anand , a place famous for its milk , are pregnant with the children of infertile couples from around the world .
The small clinic at Kaival Hospital matches infertile couples with local women , cares for the women during pregnancy and delivery , and counsels them afterward .
Anand 's surrogate mothers , pioneers in the growing field of outsourced pregnancies , have given birth to roughly 40 babies .
More than 50 women in this city are now pregnant with the children of couples from the United States , Taiwan , Britain and beyond .
The women earn more than many would make in 15 years .
But the program raises a host of uncomfortable questions that touch on morals and modern science , exploitation and globalization , and that most natural of desires : to have a family .
Dr. Nayna Patel , the woman behind Anand 's baby boom , defends her work as meaningful for everyone involved .
" There is this one woman who desperately needs a baby and cannot have her own child without the help of a surrogate .
And at the other end there is this woman who badly wants to help her ( own ) family , " Patel said .
" If this female wants to help the other one ... why not allow that ?
...
It 's not for any bad cause .
They 're helping one another to have a new life in this world . "
Experts say commercial surrogacy — or what has been called " wombs for rent " — is growing in India .
While no reliable numbers track such pregnancies nationwide , doctors work with surrogates in virtually every major city .
The women are impregnated in - vitro with the egg and sperm of couples unable to conceive on their own .
Commercial surrogacy has been legal in India since 2002 , as it is in many other countries , including the United States .
But India is the leader in making it a viable industry rather than a rare fertility treatment .
Experts say it could take off for the same reasons outsourcing in other industries has been successful : a wide labor pool working for relatively low rates .
Critics say the couples are exploiting poor women in India — a country with an alarmingly high maternal death rate — by hiring them at a cut -rate cost to undergo the hardship , pain and risks of labor .
" It raises the factor of baby farms in developing countries , " said Dr. John Lantos of the Center for Practical Bioethics in Kansas City , Mo . " It comes down to questions of voluntariness and risk . "
Patel 's surrogates are aware of the risks because they 've watched others go through them .
Many of the mothers know one another , or are even related .
Three sisters have all borne strangers ' children , and their sister - in - law is pregnant with a second surrogate baby .
Nearly half the babies have been born to foreign couples while the rest have gone to Indians .
Ritu Sodhi , a furniture importer from Los Angeles who was born in India , spent $ 200,000 trying to get pregnant through in - vitro fertilization , and was considering spending another $ 80,000 to hire a surrogate mother in the United States .
" We were so desperate , " she said .
" It was emotionally and financially exhausting . "
Then , on the Internet , Sodhi found Patel 's clinic .
After spending about $ 20,000 — more than many couples because it took the surrogate mother several cycles to conceive —
Sodhi and her husband are now back home with their 4 - month - old baby , Neel .
They plan to return to Anand for a second child .
" Even if it cost $ 1 million , the joy that they had delivered to me is so much more than any money that I have given them , " said Sodhi .
" They 're godsends to deliver something so special . "
Patel 's center is believed to be unique in offering one - stop service .
Other clinics may request that the couple bring in their own surrogate , often a family member or friend , and some place classified ads .
But in Anand the couple just provides the egg and sperm and the clinic does the rest , drawing from a waiting list of tested and ready surrogates .
Young women are flocking to the clinic to sign up for the list .
Suman Dodia , a pregnant , baby - faced 26 - year - old , said she will buy a house with the $ 4,500 she receives from the British couple whose child she 's carrying .
It would have taken her 15 years to earn that on her maid 's monthly salary of $ 25 .
Dodia 's own three children were delivered at home and she said she never visited a doctor during those pregnancies .
" It 's very different with medicine , " Dodia said , resting her hands on her hugely pregnant belly .
" I 'm being more careful now than I was with my own pregnancy . "
Patel said she carefully chooses which couples to help and which women to hire as surrogates .
She only accepts couples with serious fertility issues , like survivors of uterine cancer .
The surrogate mothers have to be between 18 and 45 , have at least one child of their own , and be in good medical shape .
Like some fertility reality show , a rotating cast of surrogate mothers live together in a home rented by the clinic and overseen by a former surrogate mother .
They receive their children and husbands as visitors during the day , when they 're not busy with English or computer classes .
" They feel like my family , " said Rubina Mandul , 32 , the surrogate house 's den mother .
" The first 10 days are hard , but then they do n't want to go home . "
Mandul , who has two sons of her own , gave birth to a child for an American couple in February .
She said she misses the baby , but she stays in touch with the parents over the Internet .
A photo of the American couple with the child hangs over the sofa .
" They need a baby more than me , " she said .
The surrogate mothers and the parents sign a contract that promises the couple will cover all medical expenses in addition to the woman 's payment , and the surrogate mother will hand over the baby after birth .
The couples fly to Anand for the in - vitro fertilization and again for the birth .
Most couples end up paying the clinic less than $ 10,000 for the entire procedure , including fertilization , the fee to the mother and medical expenses .
Counseling is a major part of the process and Patel tells the women to think of the pregnancy as " someone 's child comes to stay at your place for nine months . "
Kailas Gheewala , 25 , said she does n't think of the pregnancy as her own .
" The fetus is theirs , so I 'm not sad to give it back , " said Gheewala , who plans to save the $ 6,250 she 's earning for her two daughters ' education .
" The child will go to the U.S. and lead a better life and I 'll be happy . "
Patel said none of the surrogate mothers has had especially difficult births or serious medical problems , but risks are inescapable .
" We have to be very careful , " she said .
" We overdo all the health investigations .
We do not take any chances . "
Health experts expect to see more Indian commercial surrogacy programs in coming years .
Dr. Indira Hinduja , a prominent fertility specialist who was behind India 's first test - tube baby two decades ago , receives several surrogacy inquiries a month from couples overseas .
" People are accepting it , " said Hinduja .
" Earlier they used to be ashamed but now they are becoming more broadminded . "
But if commercial surrogacy keeps growing , some fear it could change from a medical necessity for infertile women to a convenience for the rich .
" You can picture the wealthy couples of the West deciding that pregnancy is just not worth the trouble anymore and the whole industry will be farmed out , " said Lantos .
Or , Lantos said , competition among clinics could lead to compromised safety measures and " the clinic across the street offers it for 20 % less and one in Bangladesh undercuts that and pretty soon conditions get bad . "
The industry is not regulated by the government .
Health officials have issued non-binding ethical guidelines and called for legislation to protect the surrogates and the children .
For now , the surrogate mothers in Anand seem as pleased with the arrangement as the new parents .
" I know this is n't mine , " said Jagrudi Sharma , 34 , pointing to her belly .
" But I 'm giving happiness to another couple .
And it 's great for me . "

With all the talk about how to stimulate it , you ’d think that the economy is a giant clitoris .
Ben Bernanke may not employ this imagery , but the immediate challenge–and the issue bound to replace Iraq and immigration in the presidential race–is how best to get the economy engorged and throbbing again .
It would be irresponsible to say much about Bush ’s stimulus plan , the mere mention of which could be enough to send the Nikkei , the DAX , and the curiously named FTSE and Sensex tumbling into the crash zone again .
In a typically regressive gesture , Bush proposed to hand out cash tax rebates –except to families earning less than $ 40,000 a year .
This may qualify as an example of what Naomi Klein calls “ disaster capitalism , ” in which any misfortune can be re-jiggered to the advantage of the affluent .
But even the liberal stimulus proposals have me worried — not so much for their content as their rationale .
Most liberals want a stimulus package that includes an increase in food stamp allotments and an extension of unemployment benefits , which are both screamingly obvious measures .
Currently , the food stamp allotment amounts to about $ 1 per meal , and when four Democratic congresspersons tried living on that for a week last May they ended up even crankier than if they ’d had to sit through a week - long filibuster by Tom DeLay .
As for unemployment benefits :
They last just 25 weeks in most states and end up covering only a third of people who are laid off .
If ever there was a time to create a real working system of unemployment compensation , it is now .
Citigroup has announced plans to eliminate 21,000 ; investment banks in general will shed 40,000 .
The mortgage industry is in a state of melt - down ; and Sprint – how did they get into this ?
— will lay off 4000 full - time employees as well as 1600 part - time and contract workers .
The economic rationale for more a progressive stimulus package , which we hear now several times a day , is that the poor and the freshly unemployed will spend whatever money they get .
Give them more money in the form of food stamps or unemployment benefits and they ’ll drop more at the mall .
Money , it has been observed , sticks to the rich but just slides off the poor , which makes them the lynchpin of stimulus .
After decades of hearing the poor stereotyped as lazy , stupid , addicted , and crime - prone , they have been discovered to have this singular virtue :
They are veritable spending machines .
All this is true , but it is also a form of economy fetishism , or should I say worship ?
If we have learned anything in the last few years , it is that the economy is no longer an effective measure of human well - being .
We ’ve seen the economy grow without wage gains ; we ’ve seen productivity grow without wage gains .
We ’ve even seen unemployment fall without wage gains .
In fact , when economists want to talk about life “ on the ground , ” where jobs and wages and the price of Special K are paramount , they ’ve taken to talking about “ the real economy . ”
If there ’s a “ real economy , ” then what in the hell is “ the economy ” ?
Once it was real - er , this economy that we have .
But that was before we got polarized into the rich , the poor , and the sinking middle class .
Gross social inequality is what has “ de- coupled ” growth and productivity from wage gains for the average household .
As far as I can tell , “ the economy , ” as opposed to the “ real economy , ” is the realm of investment , and is occupied by people who live on interest and dividends instead of salaries and wages , aka the rich .
So I ’m proposing a radical shift in rhetoric :
Any stimulus package should focus on the poor and the unemployed , not because they spend more , but because they are in most in need of help .
Yes , when a parent can afford to buy Enfamil , it helps the Enfamil company and no doubt “ the economy ” too .
But let ’s not throw out the baby with the sensual bubble bath of “ stimulus . ”
In any ordinary moral calculus , the baby comes first .
Far be it from me to make the revolutionary suggestion that babies are more important than profits .
My point is just that our economy –with its dizzying bubbles , wild lending sprees , reckless downsizings , and planet - wide hyper - sensitivity – has gotten too far disconnected from ordinary human needs .
We could take the current crisis as an opportunity to fix that , at least in part , by shoring up government support for the needy and the dislocated .
Or we can wait around and watch while the appropriate imagery gets nasty , as this ghostly creature , “ the economy , ” starts acting like a nymphomaniac junkie in withdrawal .
DLD08 Israel today announced backing for Project Better Place , intended to switch motor transportation from oil to electric , and by a massive coincidence one of the project 's prime movers , Shai Agassi of Better PLC , was evangelising at the DLD ( Digital Life , Design ) show in Munich .
His objective , he says , is to " take one country off oil in a way that is repeatable . "
Israel is that country .
And the model is the mobile phone .
Really .
The point of choosing Israel , says Agassi , is that doing it in a chaotic country is important , and he claims Israel is the most chaotic nation he knows .
Plus there are helpful limits to how far you can drive in Israel - the endurance of a electric car on one ' fill up ' is about 200 km , and that easily covers the furthest you can go within Israel .
He takes a pretty rational view of how far people are prepared to go to save the planet , and when it comes to cars that 's not very far .
It 's got to be your car , no shares , with performance and size at least equivalent to today 's models .
It 's got to be affordable ( which includes image and cred , so lose points for non ' green ' Hummers ) , and it's got to be fairly easy to ' fill up ' .
That last one 's one of the gotchas of electric , and it 's Agassi 's primary point of attack .
So you 've got a vehicle that allows people to be green without it actually costing them anything to do so , and you 've got the ' filling stations ' .
Which work this way .
Israel will be blanketed with a network of battery exchange stations and roadside charge points which allow the cars to be charged whenever they 're parked .
Agassi suggests there will be about 500,000 of these , and points out that it 's doable , because they 've got them in Sweden , Norway and parts of Canada , where if you do n't plug in when you stop your engine freezes .
Charge points and swap stations mean there 's no need for lengthy charge periods , so ' filling up ' should take no more time than it does currently at a petrol station .
Israel 's helping with the economics .
It currently taxes electric vehicles at 10 per cent and petrol at 72 per cent , and the government has promised to keep the electric car tax at that level until at least 2015 .
The switchover to electric vehicles is where the mobile phone model comes in .
Say the motorist pays the equivalent of their current annual petrol bill for a mileage plan , they could be given the car to use , and it would become theirs after four years .
Other mobile plans could operate - all you can eat unlimited mileage , pay as you go , and so on .
The plan is to have the first of the cars on the road in 2009 , 100,000 in 2010 and Israel off oil within ten years .
Vehicles are being produced by Nissan and Renault , and significantly Agassi suggests France as another possible target , helped by French government policies .
London , which already operates a world - famous congestion charge , he mentions as a possible single city target market .
But he possibly underestimates the London Livingstone regime , which takes a somewhat more hair - shirted and autophobic view of green issues .
Something that perpetuates these instruments of death and undermines the bendy bus programme surely wo n't fit the picture .
Project Better Place is also backed by Israel Corp , the major local refinery operator .
As Israel has no oil , flexibility probably makes sense to the outfit .
Gotchas ?
The mobile phone model requires a pretty high hardware refresh rate , and if the auto makers are to be kept in the game they 're going to want people to be moving up every few years .
Cheaper cars , which the electric ones could effectively be , would also tend to induce people to refresh more often , so there are recycling issues to be addressed , and the carbon costs of manufacturing to be factored in .
It 's green without pain , but maybe when the maths is done it'll turn out less green than you might think , and maybe you end up with even more cars on the roads .
And where does the electricity come from ?
How green is that ?
That 's not Agassi 's department , but it could be a big boost for Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University , who has a cunning plan involving the Negev desert , huge mirrors and solar energy .
He was also at DLD , so more on this later in the week . ®
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Guess who 's helping Bank of America pay for its $ 4.1 billion purchase of Countrywide Financial ?
Answer :
The taxpayers of the United States .
That 's because Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , which is solidly profitable , will be able to use some of Countrywide 's losses to offset its own taxable income .
The tax break could total about half a billion dollars over the first five years , according to an estimate by tax guru Robert Willens , who left Lehman Brothers Friday after a 20 - year run and will be in business as Robert Willens LLC starting next week .
The losses could be worth considerably more to Bank of America starting in the sixth year , depending on how big Countrywide 's losses are when Bank of America formally acquires it .
At this point , of course , no one knows how much in losses Countrywide has run up since the junk mortgage market began souring and defaults accelerated .
Countrywide ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) itself probably does n't know .
But it seems almost certain to ultimately be in the billions .
In tax circles , Bank of America is famous for its 1988 purchase of the failed FirstRepublic Bank of Dallas , which was being auctioned off by federal regulators .
Bank of America , then known as NCNB Corp. , the parent of North Carolina National Bank , discovered a way to structure the deal to save $ 1 billion of taxes , using a convoluted strategy that none of the other bidders knew about .
That allowed NCNB to outbid its rivals for the bank , and still come out way ahead .
The Countrywide tax break is n't in that league , but it would still be worth a lot of money .
Willens estimates that Bank of America will be able to deduct $ 270 million of Countrywide 's losses annually for the first five years it owns the firm .
That 's based on a $ 6 billion purchase price - $ 4 billion to Countrywide 's common stockholders , plus the $ 2 billion of preferred stock that Countrywide sold to Bank of America in August .
Willens says that you multiply that $ 6 billion by 4.49 percent - the so - called " long - term tax - exempt rate " - to calculate how much of Countrywide 's losses Bank of America can deduct annually for five years after the purchase .
A $ 270 million annual deduction would save Bank of America something more than $ 100 million a year in federal and state income taxes .
The long - term tax - exempt rate , which is based on Treasury rates and other things so complicated that they make my teeth hurt .
The rate changes each year , Willens says , but not by much .
When I asked how it 's calculated , Willens , a master of tax arcana , threw up his hands .
( Metaphorically , of course . )
" It 's like the formula for Coca - Cola , " he said , " no one outside the circle knows it " and it's so complicated that , " no one else wants to find out . "
So over the first five years , Bank of America can use a total of $ 1.35 billion of Countrywide 's losses to shelter its income .
( That 's five years of $ 270 million annual losses . )
If Countrywide 's embedded losses when Bank of America buys it exceed $ 1.35 billion , Willens says , the bank will be able to deduct the rest of the losses , without limit , starting in the sixth year .
Is n't life fun ?
If you 're watching , comment away .
We 'll try to provide some of the highlights -- such as they are .
UPDATE : He 's a moron .
Bush just said that it does n't matter if the Iranian government knew , or did n't know , that some Iranian nationals were helping distributed IEDs in Iraq .
And I quote :
" Here 's my point , either they knew or did n't know .
What matters is , is that they 're there .
What 's worse , that the government knew , or that the government did n't know ? "
actually helping
Well , with all due respect , you simple - minded idiot , if you 're threatening to declare war on the Iranian government for actively helping the insurgents , then yes , it 's far worse if the government knew because that would mean they werethe insurgents .
But what Bush is suggesting is that it does n't matter if the government of Iran is to blame , we 're going to blame them anyway .
What 's the difference ?
That 's like asking " what 's the difference if Saddam did n't really have any ties to Al Qaeda , if the US did n't really have a plan for victory in Iraq , if Bush did n't really give the troops the equipment and numbers they neeed for victory ? "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Actor Heath Ledger was found dead Tuesday of a possible drug overdose in a Lower Manhattan apartment , the New York Police Department said .

The Academy Award - nominated actor was 28 .
Ledger was found naked and unresponsive , facedown on the floor at the foot of his bed by a housekeeper trying to wake him for an appointment with a masseuse , said police spokesman Paul Browne .
" Pills were found in the vicinity of the bed , " he told CNN .
" This is being looked at as a possible overdose , but that is not confirmed yet . "
Browne later told reporters some prescription medications were found in the room , including sleeping pills .
But he stressed police have made no determination of the cause of Ledger 's death -- that would be done by the medical examiner .
He said the pills were not " scattered about . "
No note was found and there was no indication of foul play , Browne said .
Ledger was found at about 3 p.m. , and was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency personnel about 3:30 p.m .
Watch a report about Ledger 's death »
A crowd of onlookers , photographers and reporters gathered outside the apartment building after news of Ledger 's death was reported .
Police officers were guarding the doors .
Browne said he did not know how long Ledger had been renting the apartment , which he said took up the entire fourth floor .
An autopsy would be conducted on Wednesday , said Ellen Borakove , spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner 's office .

Ledger 's family called his death " very tragic , untimely and accidental . "
" Heath has touched so many people on so many different levels during his short life , but few had the pleasure of truly knowing him , " his father said .
" He was a down - to - earth , generous , kindhearted , life - loving , unselfish individual extremely inspirational to many . "
Hollywood reacts
Condolences began pouring in from Ledger 's friends and co-stars .
" I had such great hope for him , " said Mel Gibson , who played Ledger 's father in " The Patriot , " in a statement .
" He was just taking off and to lose his life at such a young age is a tragic loss .
My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family . "
Actress Nicole Kidman , a fellow Australian and close friend of Ledger 's , said in a statement , " What a tragedy .
My heart goes out to his family . "
Watch the reaction at the Sundance Film Festival »
At the time of his death , Ledger had just finished playing the villain The Joker in " The Dark Knight , " the latest installment in the Batman series .
The film is to open in July .
Ledger was born in Perth , Australia , and named Heathcliff Andrew after the main characters of Emily Bronte 's " Wuthering Heights . "
He began acting at a local theater as a child .

Ledger 's first American film was the teen comedy " 10 Things I Hate About You " in 1999 , and he immediately attracted attention from Hollywood .
He passed up several scripts before taking a role in the Revolutionary War drama " The Patriot " in 2000 and " A Knight 's Tale " in 2001 .
He also played a supporting role in " Monster 's Ball , " among other films .
See a photo gallery of Ledger 's life and career »
" In a way I was spoon - fed a career , " he told the Glasgow Herald in 2005 .
" It was fully manufactured by a studio that believed it could put me on their posters and turn me into a product .
... I had n't figured out properly how to act , and all of a sudden I was being thrown into these lead roles . "
Controversial role
But Ledger was perhaps best known for his 2005 portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in " Brokeback Mountain , " about two cowboys who had a secret romantic relationship .
The role earned him an Oscar nomination .
" I felt that choices were being made for me , so I feel this has been my time now to find the good stories and test myself , " Ledger told the Glasgow Herald in the 2005 interview .
" It has been an interesting year , where I finally have a sense of accomplishment . "
Asked how he felt about filming love scenes with another man , Ledger said he and his co-star Jake Gyllenhaal simply focused on their roles .
" We can't say that we were n't nervous about it , " Ledger told Oprah Winfrey in 2006 .
" But once the first take was over , it 's like , ' OK .
So what ?
It 's kissing another human being .
How are we going to finish this scene ?
Let 's get on with it and let 's get out of here . ' "
In a written statement , the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said it mourns Ledger 's death , adding that his portrayal of Del Mar " changed hearts and minds in immeasurable ways . "
Ledger has a daughter , Matilda Rose , born in 2005 to his then - girlfriend , Michelle Williams , who played his on - screen wife , Alma , in " Brokeback Mountain . "
The couple have since separated .
" He was just so respected in the industry , " said Kim Serafin , senior editor of In Touch Weekly .
" It 's just horribly tragic .
He was just a fine actor and a good person , so this is horribly sad and very unexpected . "

All About Heath Ledger
Last week , Rudy Giuliani made one of the more startling mistakes of the presidential campaign to date .
Talking to reporters , on camera , Giuliani said he was at Ground Zero “ as often , if not more ” than the rescue , recovery , and cleanup workers who spent a year sifting through human remains and rubble .
He added , “ So in that sense , I ’m one of them . ”
Insulted workers were deeply offended , causing Giuliani to backpedal , but the damage was already done .
At the time , Atrios noted that “ Giuliani is making an empirical claim here which could be verified with a little reporting . ”
Good idea .
To its credit , the NYT follows up today with the truth .
A complete record of Mr. Giuliani ’s exposure to the site is not available for the chaotic six days after the attack , when he was a frequent visitor .
But an exhaustively detailed account from his mayoral archive , revised after the events to account for last - minute changes on scheduled stops , does exist for the period of Sept. 17 to Dec. 16 , 2001 .
It shows he was there for a total of 29 hours in those three months , often for short periods or to visit locations adjacent to the rubble .
In that same period , many rescue and recovery workers put in daily 12 - hour shifts .
In other words , here ’s the reality : Giuliani spent about 10 hours a month bringing celebrities and dignitaries to Ground Zero , while rescue workers and cleanup crews put in about 400 hours at the site .
In Giuliani ’s self - aggrandizing mind , the two are practically identical .
Honestly , this is the kind of gaffe that should effectively end Giuliani ’s presidential ambitions .
He ’s running on an all - 9/11 , all - the - time platform , and he ’s been caught lying about it .
As the president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , prepares to address Columbia University today amid a storm of student protest , state and city lawmakers say they are considering withholding public funds from the school to protest its decision to invite the leader to campus .
Click Image to Enlarge John Smock / AP Council Member David Weprin , left , Council Member James Gennaro , and Rabbi Zev Friedman speak to a group of demonstrators outside Columbia University yesterday in protest of Columbia 's plans for President Ahmadinejad of Iran to speak on campus .
In an interview with The New York Sun , the speaker of the Assembly , Sheldon Silver , said lawmakers , outraged over Columbia 's insistence on allowing the Iranian president to speak at its World Leaders Forum , would consider reducing capital aid and other financial assistance to the school .
Lawmakers warned about other consequences for Columbia and its president , Lee Bollinger , who has resisted campus and public pressure to cancel Mr. Ahmadinejad 's appearance today , arguing that Columbia 's commitment to scholarship requires the school to directly confront offensive ideas .
" There are issues that Columbia may have before us that obviously this cavalier attitude would be something that people would recall , " Mr. Silver said .
" Obviously , there 's some degree of capital support that has been provided to Columbia in the past .
These are things people might take a different view of knowing that this is that kind of an institution . "
Mr. Silver faulted Columbia for " attempting to legitimize this individual , " saying , " We have an obligation because of the U.N. to allow him to come to this country .
It does n't mean we have to make him welcome .
We do n't have to give him a forum . "
The speaker said he was infuriated by comments made on Saturday by the acting dean of the School of International and Public Affairs , John Coatsworth , who said in a television interview that it would have been proper for Columbia to extend a speaking invitation to Hitler in 1939 .
Mr. Coatsworth 's school is sponsoring the event .
" What makes it more outrageous is the fact that some dean yesterday said he would have invited Adolf Hitler .
It 's totally outrageous .
This is not a matter of academic freedom .
This is a matter of legitimizing people , one who was the perpetrator of the Holocaust and one who denies its existence , " Mr. Silver said .
" He 's clearly responsible for the deaths of Americans both in Iraq and elsewhere .
And he remains as much a threat to the world as anybody today .
I do n't understand what this dean and Columbia are thinking , " Mr. Silver said .
Mr. Silver 's criticism of Columbia was echoed by other elected officials , who argued that Columbia was lending its name and prestige to a leader of a terrorist - sponsoring dictatorship who denies the existence of the Holocaust , vows to eliminate Israel , preaches Islamic extremism , and aspires to build nuclear weapons .
" Bollinger made a big mistake , and there should be consequences for him for making that decision , " the chairman of the New York City Council 's Finance Committee , David Weprin , said in an interview .
" We should look at everything involving Columbia , whether it be capital projects , city and state , or other related things that we do in the city for them , " he said .
Mr. Weprin was one of several elected officials who joined Jewish leaders , Columbia students , and alumni yesterday at a demonstration at the Morningside Heights campus to protest Mr. Ahmadinejad 's talk .
" It 's not going to go away just because this episode ends .
Columbia University has to know that they will be penalized , " an assemblyman of Brooklyn , Dov Hikind , who also attended the rally , said .
The lawmaker said Mr. Ahmadinejad should be arrested when he sets foot on campus .
Speaking at the rally , a New York City Council member , James Gennaro , urged university donors to withhold their dollars from the institution , while Rep. Anthony Weiner , a potential mayoral candidate in 2009 , said Columbia 's reputation was taking a " brutal beating . "
Mr. Silver 's warning of sanctions against Columbia is a highly unusual departure for a state leader who has seldom , if ever , threatened to use the power of the state purse to punish a private university .
A spokesman for the Senate Republicans , John McArdle , said the majority conference is " going to review the whole situation and decide on how , or whether , to proceed . "
Mayor Bloomberg , who visited the Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville , Pa. , yesterday told reporters he disagreed with Columbia 's decision to host Mr. Ahmadinejad but promised the city would " provide the protection to make sure that when he gets there , he speaks safely without any threats and leaves .

Albany awards Columbia millions of dollars a year in student financial aid and also provides funding for smaller - scale capital projects .
Last year , Albany awarded the school $ 10 million for nanotechnology center and $ 12 million for a cancer center in Washington Heights .
Columbia uses the state Dormitory Authority to borrow money at low interest rates .
Mr. Silver could use his influence over the authority to weed out Columbia bonding projects before they are submitted for approval .
The school is also seeking approval from city lawmakers for its plan to expand into a 17 - acre swath of land in West Harlem .
Albany also has the power to use eminent domain to facilitate Columbia 's expansion .
Mr. Bollinger has defended his university 's invitation to Mr. Ahmadinejad , saying that in order to fulfill Columbia 's mission , he must respect the rights of faculty and deans to " create programming for academic purposes . "
On occasion , he said , " this will bring us into contact with beliefs many , most , or even all of us will find offensive and even odious . "
A year ago , Mr. Bollinger rescinded Columbia 's invitation to Mr. Ahmadinejad to speak at the same annual forum , apparently overruling a former dean of SIPA , Lisa Anderson .
Mr. Bollinger , at the time , said he could n't be certain that the Iranian leader 's presence at the school would " reflect the academic values that are the hallmark of a university event such as our World Leaders Forum . "
An assistant to Ms. Anderson said the event was cancelled because of security and logistical concerns .
Inside the university , Mr. Bollinger yesterday faced criticism from several student leaders , some of whom supported the invitation to Mr. Ahmadinejad but said they were angry that they were not consulted by the administration .
" I 've heard a lot of feedback already from people saying they do n't want to give money , " Elizabeth Goldhirsch , who graduated from Columbia 's school of journalism in 2002 , said .
" I will not make a donation if this stance is maintained . "
Mr. Bollinger , who has served as president since 2002 , also was confronting signs of increasing division in his administration .
The dean of Columbia Law School , David Schizer , in a statement called Mr. Ahmadinejad " a reprehensible and dangerous figure , " and said it would be " deeply regrettable if some misread this invitation as lending prestige or legitimacy to his views . "
Mr. Ahmadinejad , who is attending the U.N. General Assembly , arrived in New York late yesterday .
He is scheduled to speak at Columbia for an hour , beginning at 1:30 p.m. , and will issue his remarks in Farsi with simultaneous translation , a university spokesman said .
Columbia officials say the Iranian leader will be escorted onto campus through the gate at 114th Street , which leads directly to Lerner Hall .
He is scheduled to depart immediately after the event .
Campus security , which is coordinating with local and federal authorities , is planning for more than 10,000 protesters to congregate outside the university 's gates .
Columbia distributed 600 tickets to the talk , where Mr. Ahmadinejad will field questions from Mr. Bollinger as well as faculty and students .
The event is to be broadcast on televisions and lounges across campus .
Mr. Bollinger said in a statement that he would question the Iranian president on human rights issues , as well as his position that Israel should be " wiped off the map " and that the Holocaust did not occur .

Major screwups in mathematics
I do n't remember how I got thinking about this , but for the past week or so I 've been trying to think of a major screwup in mathematics .
Specifically , I want a statement S such that : A purported ( but erroneous ) proof of S was published in the mathematical literature , so that S was generally accepted as true for a significant period of time , say at least two years , but S is actually false I can not think of an example .
There are many examples of statements that were believed without proof that turned out to be false , such as any number of decidability and completeness ( non -) theorems .
If it turns out that P=NP , this will be one of those type , but as yet there is no generally accepted proof to the contrary , so it is not an example .
Similarly , if would be quite surprising to learn that the Goldbach conjecture was false , but at present mathematicians do not generally believe that it has been proved to be true , so the Goldbach conjecture is not an example of this type , and is unlikely ever to be .
There are a lot of results that could have gone one way or another , such as the three - dimensional kissing number problem .
In this case some people believing they could go one way and some the other , and then they found that it was one way , but no proof to the contrary was ever widely accepted .
Then we have results like the independence of the parallel postulate , where people thought for a long time that it should be implied by the rest of Euclidean geometry , and tried to prove it , but could n't , and eventually it was determined to be independent .
But again , there was no generally accepted proof that it was implied by the other postulates .
So mathematics got the right answer in this case : the mathematicians tried to prove a false statement , and failed , and then eventually figured it out .
Alfred Kempe is famous for producing an erroneous proof of the four - color map theorem , which was accepted for eleven years before the error was detected .
But the four - color map theorem is true .
I want an example of a false statement that was believed for years because of an erroneous proof .
If there is n't one , that is an astonishing declaration of success for all of mathematics and for its deductive methods .
2300 years without one major screwup !
It seems too good to be true .
Is it ?
Glossary for non-mathematicians
The " decidability and completeness " results I allude to include the fact that the only systems of mathematical axioms strong enough to prove all true statements of arithmetic , are those that are so strong that they also prove all the false statements of arithmetic .
A number of results of this type were big surprises in the early part of the 20th century .
statements of arithmetic .
A number of results of this type were big surprises in the early part of the 20th century .
If " P=NP " were true , then it would be possible to efficiently find solutions to any problem whose solutions could be efficiently checked for correctness .
For example , it is relatively easy to check to see if a proposed conference schedule puts two speakers in the same room at the same time , if it allots the right amount of time for each talk , if it uses no more than the available number of rooms , and so forth .
But to generate such schedules seems to be a difficult matter in general .
" P=NP " would imply that this problem , and many others that seem equally difficult , was actually easy .
The Goldbach conjecture says that every even number is the sum of two prime numbers .
The kissing number problem takes a red ping - pong ball and asks how many white ping - pong balls can simultaneously touch it .
It is easy to see that there is room for 12 white balls .
There is a lot of space left over , and for some time it was an open question whether there was a way to fit in a 13th .
The answer turns out to be that there is not .
The four - color map theorem asks whether any geographical map ( subject to certain restrictions ) can be colored with only four colors such that no two adjacent regions are the same color .
It is quite easy to see that at least four colors may be necessary ( Belgium , France , Germany , and Luxembourg , for example ) , and not hard to show that five colors are sufficient .
Classical Greek geometry contained a number of " postulates " , such as " any line can be extended to infinity " and " a circle can be drawn with any radius around any center " , but the fifth one , the notorious " parallel postulate " , was a complicated and obscure technical matter , which turns out to be equivalent to the statement that , for any line L and point P not on L , there is exactly one line L ' through P parallel to L .
This in turn is equivalent to the fact that classical geometry is done on a plane , and not on a curved surface .

Bush :
If it 's our oil , why do Venezuelans get to vote on it ?
GOP panicked that counting votes in Venezuela will spread to Florida
Monday December 3 , 2007
The Family Bush can fix Florida .
They can fix Ohio .
But it 's just driving them crazy that they can't fix the vote in Venezuela .
[ Note : Watch the reports taken from the Palast BBC investigations in Venezuela in the newly released DVD , “ The Assassination of Hugo Chavez . “ ]
The Bush Administration and its press puppies – the same ones who could n't get enough of the purple thumbs of voters of Iraq – are absolutely livid that this weekend the electorate of Venezuela had the opportunity to vote .
Typical was the mouth - breathing editorial by the San Francisco Chronicle , that the referendum could make Hugo Chavez , Venezuela 's President , “ a constitutional dictator for life . ”
And no less a freedom fighter than Donald Rumsfeld , from the height of the Washington Post , said that by voting , Venezuela was “ receding into dictatorship . ”
Oh , my !
Given that Chavez ' referendum was defeated at the ballot box , we now know that , as a dictator , Chavez is a flop .
Of course , without meaning to gainsay Secretary Rumsfeld , maybe Chavez is not a dictator .
Let 's get clear exactly what this vote was about .
Firstly , it was a referendum to change the nation 's constitution to end term limits for President .
Oh , horror !
Imagine if we eliminated term limits in the US !
We could end up stuck with a president – like Franklin Roosevelt .
Worse , if Bill Clinton could have run again , we'd have missed out on the statesmanship of Junior Bush .
While US media called Chavez a “ tyrant ” for suggesting an end to term limits , they somehow forgot to smear the tyrant tag on Mr. Clinton for suggesting the same for the America .
We were not told this weekend 's referendum was a vote on term limits , rather , we were told by virtually every US news outlet that the referendum was to make Chavez , “ President for Life . ”
The “ President for Life ” canard was mis-reported by no less than The New York Times .
But ending term limits does not mean winning the term .
As Chavez himself told me , “ It 's up to the people ” whether he gets reelected .
And that infuriates the US Powers That Be .
Secondly , beyond ending term limits , the referendum would have loaded the nation 's constitution with changes in property law , work hours and so many other complex economic adjustments that the entire referendum sank of its own weight .
It 's the Oil .
Term limits and work hours in Venezuela ?
Why was this a crisis for Washington ?
Why is the Bush crew so bonkers about Hugo ?
Is it because Venezuela sits on the world 's largest reserve of coconuts ?
Like Operation Iraqi Liberation ( “ OIL ” ) – it 's all about the crude , dude .
And lots of it .
The US Department of Energy documents I obtained indicate that the guys holding Bush 's dipstick figure that Venezuela is sitting on 1.36 trillion barrels of crude , five times the reserves of Saudi Arabia .
Chavez ' continuing tenure means that Venezuelans ' huge supply of oil will now be in the hands of Venezuelans !
As Arturo Quiran , resident of a poor folks ' housing complex , told me , “ Ten , fifteen years ago there was a lot of oil money here in Venezuela but we did n't see it . ”
Notably , Quiran does n't particularly agree with Chavez ' politics .
But , he thought Americans should understand that under Chavez ' Administration , there 's a doctor 's office in his building with “ free operations , x-rays , medicines .
Education also .
People who never knew how to read and write now know how to sign their own papers . ”
Not everyone is pleased .
As one TV news anchor , violently anti-Chavez , told me in derisive tones , “ Chavez gives them ( the poor ) bricks and bread ! ” – how dare he !
– so , they vote for him .
Big Oil has better ideas for Venezuela , best expressed in several Wall Street Journal articles attacking Chavez for spending his nation 's oil wealth on “ social programs ” rather than on more drilling platforms to better fill the SUVs of Texas .
Chavez has committed other crimes in Washington 's eyes .
Not only has this uppity brown man spent Venezuela 's oil wealth in Venezuela , he withdrew $ 20 billion from the US Federal Reserve .
Weirdly , Venezuela 's previous leaders , though the nation was dirt poor , lent billions to the US Treasury on crap terms .
Chavez has said , Basta ! to this game , and has called for keeping South America 's capital in South America !
Oh , no !
Oh , and did I mention that Chavez told Exxon it had to pay more than a 1 % royalty to his nation on the heavy crude the company extracted ?
And that 's why they have to kill him .
In 2002 , The New York Times sickeningly applauded the coup d'etat against Chavez .
But that failed .
Therefore , as the electorate of Venezuela is obstinately refusing to vote as Condi Rice tells them , there 's only one solution left for democracy - loving Bush - niks , the view express out loud by our President 's spiritual advisor , Pat Robertson :
“ We have this enemy to our south controlling a huge pool of oil .
Hugo Chavez thinks we 're trying to assassinate him .
I think we ought to go ahead and do it .
We do n't need another $ 200 billion war It 's a whole lot easier to have some covert operatives do the job . ”
But Hugo 's not my enemy .
Indeed , he 's made a damn good offer to the American people : oil for $ 50 a barrel – nearly half of what it sells today .
By locking in a long - term price , Venezuela loses its crazy Iraq war oil - price windfall .
In return , we agree not to let oil prices fall through the floor ( it dropped to $ 9 a barrel in 1998 ) and bankrupt his nation .
But Saudi Arabia does n't like that deal .
And Abdullah 's wish is George Bush 's command .
( Interestingly , Chavez ' fellow no -term - limits dictator Bill Clinton endorsed the concept . )
I do n't agree with everything Chavez does .
And I 've found some of his opponents ' point well taken .
But unlike Bush , I do n't think I should have a veto over the Venezuelan vote .
And the locals ' sentiments are quite clear .
I drove with one opposition candidate , Julio Borges , on a campaign stop to a small town three hours from Caracas .
We met his supporters – or , more accurately , his lone supporter .
The “ rally ” was in her kitchen .
She served us delicious arepas .
The next day , I returned to that very same town when Chavez arrived .
Nearly a thousand screaming fans showed up – and an equal number were turned away .
( The British Telegraph laughably reports that Chavez ' boosters appear “ under duress . ” )
You'd think they were showing for a taping of “ South American Idol . ”
( Well , the Venezuelan President did break into song a few times . )
It 's worth noting that Chavez ' personal popularity does n't extend to all his plans for “ Bolivarian ” socialism .
And that killed his referendum at the ballot box .
I guess Chavez should have asked Jeb Bush how to count votes in a democracy .
So there you have it .
Some guy who thinks he can take Venezuela 's oil and oil money and just give it away to Venezuelans .
And these same Venezuelans have the temerity to demand the right to pick the president of their choice !
What is the world coming to ?
In Orwellian Bush - speak and Times - talk , Chavez ' referendum was portrayed before the vote as a trick , a kind of “ Saddam goes Latin . ”
Maybe their real fear is that Chavez has brought a bit of economic justice through the ballot box , a trend that could spread northward .
Think about it : Chavez is funding full health care for all Venezuelans .
What if that happened here ?

COLUMBIA , S.C. — Robert L. Johnson , the founder of Black Entertainment Television , who is campaigning today in South Carolina with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , just made a suggestion that raised the specter of Barack Obama ’s past drug use .
He also compared Mr. Obama to Sidney Poitier , the black actor , in “ Guess Who ’s Coming to Dinner . ”
At a rally here for Mrs. Clinton at Columbia College , Mr. Johnson was defending recent comments that Mrs. Clinton made regarding Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. She did not mean to take any credit away from him , Mr. Johnson said , when she said that it took President Johnson to sign the civil rights legislation he fought for .
Dr. King had led a “ moral crusade , ” Mr. Johnson said , but such crusades have to be “ written into law . ”
“ That is the way the legislative process works in this nation and that takes political leadership , ” he said .
“ That ’s all Hillary was saying . ”
He then added : “ And to me , as an African - American , I am frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Hillary and Bill Clinton , who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues since Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood –­ and I wo n’t say what he was doing , but he said it in the book –­ when they have been involved . ”
Moments later , he added : “ That kind of campaign behavior does not resonate with me , for a guy who says , ‘ I want to be a reasonable , likable , Sidney Poitier ‘ Guess Who ’s Coming to Dinner . ’
And I ’m thinking , I ’m thinking to myself , this ai n’t a movie , Sidney .
This is real life . ”
A former Clinton campaign official in New Hampshire had to resign last month after he publicly suggested that Republicans would probably use Mr. Obama ’s drug use in his youth , which he first wrote about in his memoirs , against him .
Update | 5 p.m. Mr. Johnson just released this statement , through the Clinton campaign :
My comments today were referring to Barack Obama ’s time spent as a community organizer , and nothing else .
Any other suggestion is simply irresponsible and incorrect .
“ When Hillary Clinton was in her twenties she worked to provide protections for abused and battered children and helped ensure that children with disabilities could attend public school .
That results oriented leadership — even as a young person — is the reason I am supporting Hillary Clinton . ”
Update | 6:30 p.m. Bill Burton , an Obama campaign spokesman said : “ His tortured explanation does n’t hold up against his original statement .
And it ’s troubling that neither the campaign nor Senator Clinton — who was there as the remark was made – is willing to condemn it as they did when another prominent supporter recently said a similar thing . ”
( There have been a lot more developments on the Clinton - Obama front today and we ’ll be back with more in a bit . )

Web giants to settle gambling allegations
The U.S. attorney in St. Louis announced the settlements Wednesday with Microsoft Corp. , Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc. , which she accused of selling ads that steered U.S. Web surfers to offshore gambling websites .
The Justice Department considers publishers of such gambling ads to be accessories to a crime .
Without admitting or denying liability , the three companies agreed to forfeit millions of dollars they took in from the suspect ads , and Microsoft and Yahoo vowed to run public service campaigns warning young people that online gambling is illegal . …
All three Internet companies said they had stopped accepting gambling ads in 2004 , more than six months after the government warned magazine publishers that similar ads were illegal .
So they did not participate in online gaming , they simply hosted ads ( that until told otherwise , they believed to be legal ) .
Ads for a service that allows adults to consensually engage in peaceful commerce , commerce that is legal in Vegas , California , Atlantic City , Alabama via physical casinos , or if they were to find the best online casino here or elsewhere , and on countless riverboats and Indian reservations throughout this nation .
Then , when told the ads were illegal , they stopped within several months and have n’t engaged in the behavior since .
And for this , they ’re forced asked to pay Danegeld to the Feds , as well as run ad campaigns “ informing ” the public that online gambling is illegal .
I guess I ca n’t blame them for settling .
It may not be right , but I ’m sure it ’s a lot cheaper for them than going to bat against the feds , who have the advantage of writing all the rules in the first place .
This probably should n’t be considered a fine , rather it ’s “ protection money ” against the racketeers in D.C .
And it ’s not going to stop :
She said her office was continuing to investigate whether other forms of promotion , such as the sponsorship of televised tournaments by a poker company affiliate , were “ artifices to promote illegal gambling ” and therefore illegal .
Any guess as to what her investigation will find– and whether it depends on how deep the pockets are of the subject of investigation ?

Look who ’s joining the party :
Under fierce attack by Democrats over the children ’s health insurance plan , House Minority Leader John A. Boehner said Sunday Republicans will unveil their own health care plan over the next few months .
“ Republicans are working on a plan that will provide access to all Americans to high quality health insurance , make sure that we increase the quality of insurance that we have in American , and we want to foster a sprit of innovation , ” said Boehner on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ This is a plan we ’ll see over the next coming months where we put the patients in charge of their health care . ”
I agree with Steve Benen ’s analysis : “ I ’m well aware of the fact that the Republican plans for universal coverage are n’t going to be very good .
That ’s the not the point .
It ’s more important to realize the big picture — we ’ll soon have Dems and Republicans arguing not over whether to have every American insured , but how best to have every American insured . ”
Yup .
The debate is shifting in the right direction .
Soon , it will be very easy for a Democratic president to put a universal health care plan forward to the American people , because the need for such a plan will already be well - established .
The same can be said for global warming , in large part thanks to Nobel laureate Al Gore .
It can not be said for the Iraq War .
It feels like that issue is still being fought on Republicans ’ turf .
Sammy Gitau defied the odds to get from Mathare to Manchester
Sammy Gitau was initially refused a visa to attend the UK university as he had only two years of formal education .
He grew up in crime - ridden Mathare slum in the Kenyan capital , Nairobi , where from the age of 13 he was the family breadwinner after his father 's murder .
He sold drugs and battled addiction before turning his life around .
' Slum potential '
The University of Manchester describes his achievement in winning a master 's degree as " a miraculous journey " .
" It feels wonderful ; it feels wonderful , " Mr Gitau told the BBC's Network Africa about receiving his MSc degree in international development project management .
I will go back and stop children going through the same kind of life as me
Sammy Gitau
" It makes me look back and see myself , see those difficult times , and also , importantly , realise we have potential people in the slums .
" We have other people who are just like me . "
Mr Gitau , 35 , once came close to death after a drugs overdose and said it changed his life .
" After the drugs put me in a coma , I remember hearing hospital staff telling me I was going to die and when you are dying , you make a deal with God , " he said .
Mathare is crime - ridden slum in the centre of the Kenyan capital
" You just say , ' Get me out of here and I will do anything .
I will go back and stop children going through the same kind of life as me . ' "
Once out of hospital he began a project to help children in the slum where he grew up .
Mathare is the most crime - ridden of all Nairobi 's slums where organised outlawed gangs reign supreme .
Mr Gitau 's community resource centre used donated containers as classrooms and with three volunteers taught children skills like carpentry , tailoring , computer skills and baking .
It costs $ 100 a month to run and is estimated to have helped some 20,000 slum children .
This work brought him to the attention of European Union officials working in Kenya , who , on hearing of his dream , helped him apply to the University of Manchester 's School of Environment and Development .
The university decided his vast experience on the ground made him eligible to study and paid his course fees ; his living costs were funded by charitable donations .
" I found it humbling to teach Sammy - it really is a remarkable achievement , " the University of Manchester 's programme director Pete Mann said .
Mr Gitau says he will continue to direct his education and his energies at improving life for others in Mathare slum .
Here 's the first gorgeous shot of an Google Android prototype in the wild .
It looks HTC - ish in build , similar to the grainy versions we 've seen in the official videos and the renderings in the SDK emulator .
Our source , a Giz reader , had some feedback to add to the prototype , which he used for a day :
Even in early form , it 's light and fast , much faster than the desktop emulator at times .
And as a longtime programmer , he thinks it 's a lot more put together than Window Mobile 5 on the back side of things .
It 's a prototype , so things will obviously change , but these are all great signs .
I just pray that hardware by other makers is a lot more adventurous .
In my mind , those HTC designs remind me a little too much of WM and will for a long time .

An explosion of new research is vastly changing scientists ’ understanding of diabetes and giving new clues about how to attack it .
The fifth leading killer of Americans , with 73,000 deaths a year , diabetes is a disease in which the body ’s failure to regulate glucose , or blood sugar , can lead to serious and even fatal complications .
Until very recently , the regulation of glucose — how much sugar is present in a person ’s blood , how much is taken up by cells for fuel , and how much is released from energy stores — was regarded as a conversation between a few key players : the pancreas , the liver , muscle and fat .
Now , however , the party is proving to be much louder and more complex than anyone had shown before .
New research suggests that a hormone from the skeleton , of all places , may influence how the body handles sugar .
Mounting evidence also demonstrates that signals from the immune system , the brain and the gut play critical roles in controlling glucose and lipid metabolism .
( The findings are mainly relevant to Type 2 diabetes , the more common kind , which comes on in adulthood . )
Focusing on the cross - talk between more different organs , cells and molecules represents a “ very important change in our paradigm ” for understanding how the body handles glucose , said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn , a diabetes researcher and professor at Harvard Medical School .
While we harbor a decent amount of suspicion regarding the new Knight Rider , we do feel much better knowing that Will Arnett of Arrested Development fame is going to be the new voice of KITT .
( you may have noticed we make AD jokes whenever we can , just look at all our Dieter Zetsche posts ) .
If only we could find a way to get KITT to say " I know what an erection feels like , Michael . "
What do you want to hear KITT / Gob Bluth / WIll Arnett say ?

Guess which drug is illegal ? /
One deadens nerves , barely works , has foul side effects .
The other helps you feel God
Over here we have a new drug .
It has one particularly unfortunate side effect :
It makes you fat .
Or rather , fatter , given how most patients who take it are already quite overweight to begin with .
But that 's not all .
Other nasty side effects include dizziness , confusion , sleepiness , severe edema ( swelling and oozing ) , among others .
What fun .
But hey , at least it works , right ?
Well , no , not really .
It apparently works only about half the time , if that , and even then it does n't work very well and it certainly does n't actually cure anything or treat any of the potential causes of your illness or address any of the deeper biological / psychological issues at hand and , in fact , only " works " ( they guess , but do n't actually know ) by essentially numbing the central nervous system and therefore merely blocking out what your body is trying to tell you .
Sort of like saying the light hurts your eyes and then taking a pill to make you go blind .
There now , all better .
This new drug is called Lyrica .
It 's from Pfizer , and it was just approved by the FDA to treat an awful , inscrutable condition known as fibromyalgia , an is - it - or - is n't - it illness distinguished by all - over bodily pain the causes of which no one can figure and which few are really sure is even a real disease , per se , given that there 's no biological test to diagnose it and no way to accurately validate its existence and given that it has all sorts of seemingly unrelated , scattershot symptoms , like irritable bowel ( another suspect ailment ) and ringing in the ears and , well , just about everything else .
No matter .
After years of doubt as to its effectiveness ( and fibromyalgia 's existence ) , Lyrica has been approved , and fibromyalgia has been more or less legitimized .
Pfizer stands to make billions , as do the other pharmco titans who are begging the FDA to let them make expensive new drugs to treat this strange condition that no one seems to understand — drugs which may actually exacerbate the condition — but which clearly has enough patients who seem to be suffering from it even though they might very well be suffering from something else entirely .
Ah , the pharmaceutical industry .
Tremendous amounts of good , underscored by giant bolts of shameless , exploitive , predatory evil .
Is n't it fascinating ?
Over here , another drug .
This one 's been around awhile .
World famous , beloved by millions , controversial for all the wrong reasons .
It is currently very , very illegal .
Producing and selling it in any quantity can result in severe punishment , years in prison .
It has been deemed highly dangerous , potentially toxic , even lethal , and for years the government and the Centers for Disease Control and your own mother have issued all sorts of lies and alarmist B.S. about it , like how it drains spinal fluid , induces brain aneurisms , makes you vote Libertarian .
Which is not to say taking it does n't have its random dangers , but , you know , please .
This drug is famous for producing incredible feelings of euphoria , openness , warmth and love and happiness in almost everyone who takes it .
It is staggeringly effective , non-addictive , and when taken somewhat responsibly and with a slight hint of intelligence , has very few , if any , notable or permanent side effects .
Its positives border on miraculous .
It can effortlessly break down long - held psychological barriers , remove obstacles to communication and stifled emotion , make patients / users feel open and happy and much better able to handle stress , anxiety , all manner of trauma .
It gets better .
Some of the deeper emotional breakthroughs it produces last for weeks , months , or forever .
Truly , entire loving relationships have been launched based on the deep bonding and raw emotional honesty a couple discovers while on it , and in many cases , those feelings become the foundation for long - term marriages ( or , by way of the same raw honesty , encourage the end of unhappy , dying ones ) .
Oh yes — this drug also frequently induces profound , life - changing spiritual awakenings , can eradicate neurosis , increase feelings of empathy and forgiveness and peace and overlay it all with an increased love of music and sensual pleasure .
Thank God it 's illegal .
This drug , as you 've already guessed , is MDMA , or ecstasy .
It has finally , after years of governmental ignorance and lack of balls / foresight / integrity in the psychiatric community , earned tacit approval for a precious handful of clinical psychiatric trials .
Initial results ?
Turns out this scary illegal drug just might work wonders for treating post - traumatic stress disorder .
Gosh , really ?
Yes .
As reported by the Washington Post and the Guardian , as far as PTSD alone is concerned , some docs already see MDMA as potentially life - saving , a true wonder drug , which might even be administered to all our traumatized U.S. soldiers .
Which could be good news indeed , given how an estimated 24 million Americans suffer from PTSD , whereas only a fraction of that number claim to have fibromyalgia .
Oh , but there are problems .
Major drawbacks .
Terrible , unspeakable , anti-American issues that seriously trouble our drug - addled nation .
Foremost : MDMA is not patented .
Its formula is not owned by anyone .
Hence , no single company ( or handful of companies ) stands to make billions from its potential legalization and the government cannot tax it and organized religion cannot control the power it has to help you totally reject its inane dogma , and they all really , really hate that .
What 's more , millions of people already take MDMA recreationally , for the sheer pleasure and joy of it , making it a huge threat to all authority everywhere , because God knows we can't have lots of people feeling peaceful and empathetic and nonviolent , as opposed to fearful and victimized and angry and sick sick sick , all those things governments and religions rely on to keep you meek and beaten down and in check .
I know what you 're thinking .
That 's a dangerous oversimplification , Mark .
Read the literature !
Ecstasy is scary !
People can overdose !
" Moderation " is not in America 's DNA !
With the possible exception of extreme PTSD cases , we should probably keep MDMA illegal forever — you know , just like that other toxic , wildly addictive drug that causes thousands of deaths every year , along with liver disease and violence and spousal abuse and trauma and impaired judgment and unwanted pregnancy and frat boys and which you can order as much as you want right now in any bar in the world .
Oh wait .
Maybe it really is just that simple , just that odious .
One drug , nasty and of hugely questionable value , essentially designed to numb your body and mock your spirit and shut you down like a land mine shuts down a cat , is legal .
Another drug , relatively safe , enormously effective in how it opens you up like a flower and pours white hot life straight down your throat and helps you feel God without forcing you to kneel before , well , anything at all , is violently illegal .
And thus doth the brutal irony of the capitalist machine floweth over once again .
It is , you could say , just another tale of the tense , vicious battle ever raging between the government / corporations / church , all of whom seek to control and profit by murdering any notion you may have that you might be far more powerful , divinely connected , empathetic than you imagine , and the humane , common - sensical universe of peaceful reality .
Do you know that fight ?
Do you ever sense that common sense is losing ?
I have a suggestion for something you might want to try .

At least 15 feet of lumber - I recommend 1x2 " boards
Plywood or misc .

20 - 40 wood screws

The first thing you 'll notice about your lens is that it flops around and refuses to stay straight .
The lens absolutely must be flat in order to work right , so we need to build a frame .
This will also prevent it from being bent or cracked .
Note : the ridges on one side of the lens areand scratch effortlessly .
A few scratches wo n't affect performance , but look terrible .
Try not to drag the lens against anything .
The goal here is to secure the lens in a frame .
The most elegant way to do this is to cut a groove down the length of each piece of wood , so the lens fits into the slot .
By lowering the saw blade on my table saw so it only stuck up about half an inch , I was able to cut perfect grooves down the boards .
Once you have your grooved beams , you 'll need to cut them just long enough to come together with the lens nested into the grooves .
Make sure the grooves are all on the inside , and after measuring exactly how long each side should be , cut the sides at 45° angles so the corners look nice .
I used a miter to get the precise angles here .
Once the frame pieces are positioned around the lens you can pull everything together .
We sandwiched each corner between two pieces of plywood and put screws through all 3 layers , but there are lots of options for this part .
It 's a little complicated , and the method varies depending on what tools you have available .
If you do n't have a table saw , there are other ways to make a groove , or you could trap the lens with multiple boards .
If you have any kind of workshop you should be able to rig up something .
I do n't advise screwing directly into the lens though , because it might crack .
Once your frame is done , you can move the lens around safely .
Nowyou go out and start burning stuff , I must urge you to wear the strongest sun glasses you can find , glacier goggles are better , but nothing short of welding goggles are really going to protect your eyes .
The light spots these lenses can produce are literally as bright as the sun .
On that note , be extremely careful where you put this lens .
If it 's sunny out , the thing should n't even be left outside ... you never know when it might decide to focus and set your house on fire !
Once again I am not liable for anything , including forest fires , so use your head .
Two Jedi this morning turned up at the UN's London HQ to demand official recognition of their religion , The Sun reports .
" Umada " and " Yunyun " - aka 27 - year - old John Wilkinson and 24 - year - old Charlotte Law - timed their " protest " to coincide with today 's UN International Day of Tolerance , which they 'd like renamed " Interstellar Day of Tolerance " .
Wilkinson said : " We have come here today to ask that we are recognised as the fourth largest religion in this country . "
Indeed , more than 390,000 Brits are practising Jedi , according to the 2001 census .
Brighton is the country 's principal centre of Jedi activity , with 6,480 professing to follow the faith .
Chewbacca was also on hand to petition the UN , and said via translator Yunyun : " It is not fair that there are lots of different life forces across the galaxy that are not getting recognised . " ®

Anyone who follows the slate of lawsuits against music fans is cognizant of the crucial role that IP addresses play in attempts to cow suspected file sharers .
But as we have seen time and time again , IP addresses are not consistently reliable means of identifying users .
Law enforcement officials and a family in Gretna , Virginia and learned that lesson the hard way after their home was searched by a law enforcement team that included Miami Heat center Shaquille O'Neal , according to a law enforcement official .
The spectre of an angry , uniform - wearing Shaq , let alone an entire team of deputies and federal marshalls would be enough to turn one 's knees to jelly .
That 's the sight apparently witnessed by farmer A.J. Nuckols , his schoolteacher wife , and three children last month when their home was raided and their computers , DVD , video tapes , and other belongings were confiscated after they were connected to an IP address reportedly used to access child pornography on the Internet .
It turned out to be a case of mistaken identity .
Nine days after the raid , an investigator told Nuckols that " the wrong IP address had been identified " and that he and his family would not be charged in the investigation .
It 's great that the Nuckols family is off the hook , but they now have to live with the stigma of having been the targets of a raid by law enforcement .
According to Lt. Mike Harmony of the Bedford County Sheriff 's Department , the problem lay with Fairpoint Communications , the ISP for the Nuckols family .
As part of an ongoing investigation into Internet trafficking of child pornography , investigators identified an IP address via which an undercover investigator was able to download child porn .
The IP address was traced to Fairpoint , which was served a subpoena requesting the name and address of the subscriber using the IP address in question .
" Fairpoint said that on that date and time , the IP address was assigned to the Nuckols household , " Lt. Harmony told Ars Technica .
" Some time after the search warrant was executed , we were notified that Fairpoint had misread the court order and done a wrong conversion on the time . "
After receiving updated information from the ISP , investigators executed another search warrant on Friday , October 20 .
This time , they seized a PC with child pornography on the hard drive and obtained a statement from the investigation target that he had in fact downloaded and shared child porn .
The misguided raid , along with numerous other cases of mistaken online identity , raises serious questions about the use of IP addresses as identifying data .
Take the music industry 's crusade against file sharing as an example .
Although the RIAA is reluctant to divulge how they acquire the names and addresses of those that they target , it generally begins with an IP address flagged as sharing music by a program like MediaSentry .
From there , a request is made to the ISP owning that block of IP addresses to identify the account using the address at that point in time .
As the Nuckols family and Bedford County Sheriff 's Department found out , ISP data is not always accurate , which poses problems for everyone involved .
For law enforcement , it makes identifying guilty parties more difficult .
And for those mistakenly targeted by police or the RIAA , it can result in very traumatic experiences , not to mention costly legal fees .
Although the temptation to pluck an IP address of the Internet and use it as a means of making positive identification is strong , investigators need to dig deeper and use a greater breadth of data to be sure they have the right culprit .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Some 7,200 people have registered to run in Iran ’s March parliamentary elections , when reform - minded opponents of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hope to benefit from growing disenchantment with the hardline leader .
The March 14 vote could prove a tough test for reformists seeking a political revival after they were beaten by conservatives in a 2004 parliamentary election for failing to meet their promise to create a freer country .
They also expect the conservative - controlled Guardian Council , which vets candidates for all elections , to block most of their candidates as it has done in the past .
But the conservatives are struggling to show a united front despite controlling the armed forces , judiciary , powerful watchdog bodies , parliament and presidency .
The conservatives have so far failed to propose a joint lists of candidates , and the absence of a unified voice could cost them the election , following defeats in city and local council elections last year .
Analysts say reformists stand a better chance than in previous elections because many Iranians criticize Ahmadinejad for failing to deliver on promised economic change , including sharing out Iran ’s oil wealth more broadly .
Interior Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi said on Saturday that 7,200 people -- including 590 women -- had registered to run by Friday ’s deadline .
Candidates will compete for 290 seats in parliament .
He told a news conference that over 43.2 million people were eligible to vote in Iran , where the population is over 70 million .
“ Those Iranians who are eligible ( to vote ) and live abroad will be added to this figure , ” Pourmohammadi said .
POLICY IMPACT
The result of the election will have no direct impact on who is president , or on policies such as Iran ’s nuclear program , which is ultimately determined by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
But political analysts say it may influence the debate , and could give Ahmadinejad more political challenges .
Among the last candidates who signed up on Friday was Ali Larijani , a close adviser to Khamenei .
A group of moderate - conservative parties had nominated him as their candidate for the vote .
Larijani , a rival of Ahmadinejad , stepped down as chief nuclear negotiator in October , exposing a rift with Ahmadinejad about tactics in handling nuclear talks with the West .
Iran is at odds with the United States and its European allies over its nuclear program , which the West fears is a cover to build nuclear arms .
Iran denies the charge .
Former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian , accused by a Swiss judge of ordering the killing of a member of an Iranian opposition group in 1990 in Switzerland , has also signed up .
A German court in 1996 issued an arrest warrant for Fallahian in connection with the so - called Mykonos affair in which the mid-ranking cleric was accused of having played a role in the killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992 .
Iran denies any involvement in the killings .
The final list of approved candidates will be announced on March 5 .
Candidates will then have one week to campaign .
I need to prepare in such a way that I can get through a possible bad time , and then be in a position to help make things better .
To do this I need to understand what I am preparing for .
This means considering the various phases that each scenario might go through .
The first and most important preparation has been mentioned in Part 1 .
We need to cut our consumption .
Reduce .
Reuse .
Recycle .
Grow food at home .
Install water tanks .
Attitudes to consumption need to change .
We know what we need to do ; we just need to do it .
Here in Australia , we may have some tough times , but our children and grandchildren will grow up and emerge from these trials knowing no other world - and full of the usual dreams and hopes of youth .
The future that we hand on to our children and grandchildren depends on the changes and preparations that we make now .
It is fair to assume that things will change .
It is fair to assume that there may be wars .... because somewhere in the world there is always a war .
Resource depletion just exacerbates this situation .
So , is Mad Max a good how - to guide for the decades ahead - am I building a bunker and stocking up on shotgun shells ?
No .
And here is why :
If things get so bad that I need to shoot people as part of my day - to - day activities , then my son has no future .
That is not a future , it is an end .
Here are some possible phases for some of the scenarios we might go through ( world wide ) :
Phase 1 . Business As Usual .
I am employed and life is good .
Phase 2 . Business Not -Quite - As Usual .
Times are hard .
A lot of people ca n’t find employment .
Many people have been forced to turn to crime , just to get by .
Food security is sometimes a problem .
Personal security is a problem .
Security for my family is a problem .
Utilities sometimes do n’t work .
Unlicenced local markets are starting to appear to peddle food and other common commodities .
Phase 3 . Partial Collapse .
Times are very bad .
Unemployment is widespread .
Utilities frequently do n’t work .
Law and order is severely impacted .
Almost the only place you can get goods and food is in “ Grey Markets ” – venues that operate with no official accreditation or sanction , questionable hygiene , and where security is provided by ugly - looking characters with baseball bats .
Phase 4 . Collapse .
The old system does not work at all .
The “ Grey Market ” has expanded into almost every area .
Organizing and providing security for the markets is virtually the only process left that works .
These markets now deal with scavenging , reusing and recycling machinery and commodities of all sorts .
Violence is widespread , with warlords and grey marketers being almost the only sources of security .
Phase 5 . Rebuilding .
Enlarging on the process of scavenging , an industry of rebuilding slowly emerges .
This process , of course , can only occur if there are adequate resources for the population .
Those are countless scenarios , which range from the benign ( consumption is curbed , population growth gradually comes under control and disaster is averted with only minor social dislocation ) to the catastrophic ( severe resource constraints cause massive difficulties in South East Asia , Indonesia invades Papua New Guinea in order to secure resources , Australia objects and becomes embroiled in a region - wide war ) .
The future is unclear , but business has long known how to deal with situations like this :
Generate scenarios to identify risks ,
Use statistical tools to get a feel for the probabilities of the risks .
Examine impacts for each risk Generate priorities , based on impact and probability for each risk .
Decide on strategies , based on the priorities identified above .
Risk management is very inexact , and extremely subject to personal bias , but I am going to try to put some numbers against the risks that I list below .
In risk management , two numbers are important – likelihood and impact .
How likely is each risk , and how close to complete disaster do we come if it occurs ?
So here goes .
I 'm going to be lazy and look at Best Case and Worst Case scenarios in the hope that these stimulate thinking about preparations that can cover most things in between :
Best Case Scenario
Our way of life depends on oil , but it does not require the volume that we currently consume .
Much of our consumption is devoted to activities that provide little or no real benefit - do I really need a Shrek doll with my MacDonald ’s meal ?
Would I miss it , if it was n't there ?
The Hubbert curve suggests that initially we face a gradual decline in oil .
Perhaps a decline of 25 % across the next 20 years .
If our oil supply was gradually cut by 25 % , we would be forced to compromise in a lot of areas ( more use of public transport , less air travel , less junk food , etc ) , but we would not starve .
Of course , a sudden cut of 25 % is a very different story .
We are not set up for a sudden drop - but more on that later .
We can expect that two changes will occur as we gradually adapt to lower oil and resource supplies :
Substitution ( e.g. a move from oil to other fuels )
Behavior modification ( e.g. a move away from fossil - fueled individual transport to more efficient Mass Transport systems or to walking and biking ) .
We have some ability to replace oil with alternatives - electric vehicles , compressed natural gas , ethanol , algae biodiesel , etc .
In the decades to come , I would expect to see some significant infrastructure projects undertaken in order to produce and distribute substitute fuels .
It is easy to envisage some of the other infrastructure projects ahead :
Alternate power sources .
We are likely to need them all .
New Zealand has a bit of an advantage in geothermal , but here in Australia we should be able to utilize our solar power advantage , using both thermal and photovoltaic technologies .
As well as natural gas , algae - to - biodiesel , ethanol , wind , wave , etc , etc. Expansion of mass transport facilities .
Salvaging and recycling .
Major projects are likely to be needed to demolish the unneeded infrastructures of the consumption - oriented society and recycle salvaged materials .
Water .
God only knows what will be done about water , but we obviously need a new plan and the infrastructure to go with it .
The infrastructure projects may be complicated by resource shortages , but this is not a disaster – it simply means that choices will have to be made .
Do we need a new shopping mall or a new energy generation facility ?
We may even need to demolish a shopping mall and mine it for resources to build the natural gas facility .
Clearly , there are a lot of jobs here for engineers and construction workers .
Other areas are likely to be laying off workers , so retraining is likely to be a key role for TAFEs and other educational facilities .
What will cities look like in a resource - constrained scenario ?
Obviously public transport ( or more correctly Mass Transport ) is more efficient than individual vehicles , so there will be a greater usage of Mass Transport facilities .
Expect trains and buses to be overcrowded , as the pace of building new transport infrastructure may struggle to keep up with demand .
We can expect this pattern to be repeated everywhere - infrastructure lags demand , causing shortages and overcrowding .
In a resource - constrained society public transport is likely to be used more than private vehicles , but public transport tends to focus on delivering people to the city , so large businesses in cities will have an advantage over large businesses in outer suburbs .
Businesses in outer suburbs will need to concentrate mainly on local clientele .
Resource intense transport and consumption will be replaced by infrastructure projects that focus on supporting substitution and behavior change .
These infrastructure changes will have massive manpower requirements and could even drive a boom in education and training ( particularly in technical areas ) .
Food is more likely to be sourced locally .
In areas without easy rail or water transport , goods are more likely to be fabricated and / or maintained locally .
We are likely to re-learn the lessons our grandparents knew about thrifty living and making - do .
Risks in the Best Case Scenario
Our ability to substitute fuels makes the gradual decline scenario relatively benign , but we should not forget that infrastructure growth is unlikely to keep pace with demand .
So the big risk here is that the creation of the necessary “ Substitution ” and “ Behavior Change ” infrastructure will not keep pace with the velocity of the decline in resources .
As an example :
We simply cannot build LNG Gas plants and distribution infrastructure in 5 - 10 years .
Likewise we cannot ( or perhaps I should say " will not " ) build new train lines and rolling stock in 5 - 10 years .
The lead time on projects like this is around 5 - 7 years , just to get the necessary impact statements , designs , permits , etc done .
In 10 years this process will probably be streamlined , but 10 years from now is too late .
Risk : Failure of infrastructure construction to keep pace with resource declines .
Likelihood of this risk occurring : Very High .
Impact : Moderate .
The outcome is likely to be : Crowded public transport , possibility of less reliable utilities , reduced productivity , shortages of some goods , etc .
Worst Case Scenario .
Homo Sapiens can adapt to change .
It is what we are good at .
But there are limits to our adaptability .
The limit of our ability to adapt can be triggered by :
Sudden Change .
If a significant negative change is too sudden , our ability to cope may be exceeded .
For example :
If , over a period of 10 years , there is a 300 % increase in food prices , then people will find a way to adapt , but if this change occurs in 5 weeks we could expect problems .
Extreme Change .
If negative changes go too deep , then our ability to cope may be exceeded , even if the change occurs slowly .
For example :
We can adapt to 10 % less food , but 90 % less food will cause society to break down .
It does not matter if this change occurs slowly , eventually people will reach the point where they cannot continue to function within the framework of current society .
Multiple Changes .
If multiple negative changes occur at once our ability to cope may be exceeded .
Jared Diamond commented on this in his book “ Collapse ” .
A combination of multiple factors ( such as external threats , environmental damage , and climate stresses ) can collapse a society , despite the fact that each individual factor is not lethal .
All of these collapse triggers are plausible in our current situation .
Scenarios for each of the three triggers ( sudden change , extreme change and multiple changes ) are considered in more detail below .
Sudden Change
The Best Case Scenario suggests that the change in oil availability will be gradual , in line with the Hubbert curve .
However , there are at least three plausible events that could produce a much faster decline in availability :
Invasion of supplier nations - " Resource Wars " .
If an importing nation perceives that it has no future unless it can guarantee future resource supplies , then war is on the cards .
If multiple wars break out and many suppliers have supplies disrupted , then world supply would be severely disrupted .
Supplier lock in ( Resource nationalism ) .
If suppliers decide that their long - term welfare depends on limiting exports so that their own long - term supply is guaranteed , then supply could be drastically curtailed .
Large increases in demand .
It has been observed many times that if China and India consumed resources at the same rate as the Western World , then world oil ( and other resource ) production capabilities would be immediately overwhelmed .
Yet the Chinese and Indian people clearly have aspirations in this direction , and their economies are ramping up accordingly .
Each of these scenarios is plausible .
Each might conceivably cause a significant shock , even in a well - off nation such as Australia .
Extreme Change
There is one obvious trigger for a deep change - The Hubbert curve may start off gradually , but in 20 - 30 years it gets precipitous .
In 30 years we could find our oil supply cut dramatically .
If we are still dependant on fossil fuels in 30 years , then we deserve the inevitable consequence .
Multiple Negative Changes
Based on the discussion above , there are many factors that could interact with oil depletion , or even with each other , to form a collapse trigger .
Here is a brief discussion of some of them :
War
Australia could become drawn into regional wars , or our current involvement in Middle Eastern wars could drain us so severely that a crisis is precipitated .
The worst - case scenario is that our endowment with resources , in combination with our low population and comparatively small military could make us a target for invasion , and we might be forced to fight a war on Australian soil .
War has the capacity to be a sudden change , an extreme change and a change that interacts with others .
As a result , war is a well known collapse trigger .
Climate change
Several prominent scientists have suggested that a “ Tipping Point ” is near , or has been reached .
They further suggest that the Paleolithic evidence suggests that change is rapid once tipping points have been reached .
If sea levels were forecast to rise ( say ) 3 meters in the next 5 decades we would be forced to relocate entire cities .
Could we do this at a time of energy - scarcity ?
Other climate change impacts could further complicate things .
Crop failures , water shortages , spreading diseases , and so on .
Entire books have been written .
There may also be less predictable outcomes .
Imagine the impact of hundreds of thousands of climate - change refugees landing on our shores .
How could such a thing occur ?
It is conceivable that a nation could decide that it cannot cope with climate change refugees , and could transfer its refugee problem to Australia .
Any country that has the capacity to move troops could move refugees using the same mechanism .
Climate Change has the capacity to be a sudden change , an extreme change and a change that interacts with others .
Climate change is another well known collapse trigger .
Massive economic downturn ( depression or a similar economic collapse ) .
In an environment where capital is not available and credit is not being extended , it would be hard to mount major risk - mitigation projects .
Unfortunately , the economic “ liquidity crisis ” that is currently emerging in the US financial markets might have exactly this effect .
Disease .
At a time when resources are limited , combating disease stops being such a priority .
Will hungry people in South - East Asian nations continue destroying all their poultry every time there is an avian flu outbreak ?
Will screening for multiple drug resistant strains of TB ( MDR TB ) continue even in a time of economic downturn ?
Will societies be able to cope with an epidemic of a lethal disease if they are also trying to build new infrastructure for energy substitution ?
The World Health Organisation advises us that the question of a lethal flu pandemic is " when " not " if " .
The emergence of other resource constraints .
The Canadian Tar Sands are frequently cited as a potential solution to oil scarcity .
But processing these sands depends on water and natural gas .
Both resources are becoming constrained and severely limiting oil production .
Uranium has been proposed as a potential replacement for Natural Gas , but the price of Uranium has skyrocketed recently .
Another alternative is to burn some of the bitumen in the tar sand to provide the heat needed to extract the rest .
This works , but has obvious CO2 problems .
Other emerging resource constraints world - wide include depletion of platinum , water , copper , hafnium , indium , etc .
It is proving difficult to build new energy - producing infrastructure as the price of the necessary resources skyrockets .
Risk
It would take a book to fully explore these risks - a book that I do n't have time to write , and I 'm sure you do n't have time to read - but we have at least hit the high points .
Now that we have identified some risk scenarios , we should start to assess them .
Below is a table in which I list the risk , the likelihood , the impact and then a “ Notional Damage ” .
Notional Damage is calculated by multiplying the risk by the impact ( note that I am only interested in the worst case - catastrophe - so my definition of impact differs from the usual definition , I am defining impact as " probability of the risk creating a major dislocation " ) .
You can sum up the “ Notional Damage ” of all the risks to get a “ Total Notional Damage ” - representing the notional likelihood of complete failure of your project .
Note that this is not statistically accurate .
There exists a danger that related risks ( which might occur at the same time ) can sum to produce artificially large numbers .
As an example , if a risk is 50 % likely to happen , and would cause 50 % devastation , then the “ Notional Damage ” caused by this risk is .5 x .5 = 0.25 , or 25 % notional probability of complete devastation .
Two risks of this type will obviously give you 0.50 - notionally ( not statistically ) a 50 % chance of total devastation .
This is very inexact .
Summed notional risks are unreliable .
For this reason , very few risk managers are willing to sum risks , choosing instead to count types of risks .
In addition to statistical flaws , the summing method does not take interactions into account , nor does it consider unexpected good luck that might cause outcomes that act against the risks listed below .
However this kind of exercise can give you a gut - feel for the risk , and thus the viability of a project .
For this reason , I am willing to do it , while treating the numbers generated with extreme caution .
The table below attempts to answer this question :
Assuming that Peak Oil is a fact ( and there are now few people left who question the theory ) , then what risks could precipitate a collapse by impacting in one of
these ways :
Making Peak
Oil more sudden ( or ) Making Peak
Oil more severe ( or ) Introducing new factors that interact with Peak Oil to create more multiple negative changes than we can cope with
So here are my numbers ( feel free to substitute your own best guesses )
Risk Description Likelihood
( Likelihood of this risk occurring before 2020
- Discussion , followed by numeric value ) Impact
( Likelihood of this risk causing major dislocation before 2020 - Discussion , followed by numeric value ) Notional Damage Resource Wars .
Invasion of energy - supplier nations by resource - depleted aggressors
Although this seems to be occurring already , the Iraq experience is likely to discourage imitation for a while .
( Ultimately , resource depletion is likely to lead to war , but probably not in the timeframe under consideration . )
.06 Impact depends on the effectiveness of the invasion and the number of nations affected .
It is unlikely that by 2020 a significant number of suppliers could be invaded so ineptly that oil supplies were cut off .
0.3 0.02 Supplier Lock - in ( Resource nationalism ) Low .
Suppliers would be aware that lock - in could lead to action against them .
0.2 Low .
Impact would depend on the degree of lock - in and the number of suppliers who attempted it .
0.1 0.02 Large increases in demand Medium .
Occurring already in China and India , but moderated by the market .
0.5 Low .
As long as Australia can outspend emerging nations , this will impact us , but not be a show - stopper .
0.1 0.05 Australian involvement in a major war ( as an aggressor or as an invasion target ) Extremely Low .
We are too smart to over - involve ourselves in a foreign war , and too far away to be a viable target at a time of limited logistics .
0.02 Severe .
An invasion of Australia would be crippling , and a resource - draining military overextension would be almost as bad .
0.9 0.018 Abrupt Climate Change ( rising sea levels , decades - long droughts , etc ) Low within the pre-2020 timeframe .
The Paleolithic evidence supports the concept of abrupt climate change .
But the probability that it will hit before 2020 seems
low ?
0.15 . High - Severe .
Even a 0.2 meter increase in sea level by 2020 would be sufficient evidence to force us to commence relocating city functions and infrastructure .
Venice adapted to rising seas – but it would be a hard thing to do in a time of resource constraints .
0.8 0.12 Massive economic downturn Low - Medium .
High oil prices combined with the sub - prime meltdown and “ liquidity crisis ” could plausibly have severe economic consequences .
However it appears that the " Resource Boom " has largely insulated Australia from the worst effects .
0.3 Low - Medium .
A bad economy could place severe constraints on any attempts at mitigating responses to resource constraints .
0.3 0.09 Pandemic Disease Low - Medium .
According to the World Health Organization , a lethal flu pandemic is a matter of “ when ” not “ if ” .
New diseases and drug - resistant diseases are constantly emerging .
Bird Flu and MDR TB are two examples .
0.3 Low - Medium , depending on severity and timing .
The emergence of a pandemic disease at a time when society is resource - constrained and attempting to mount projects in response to these constraints could create severe problems as conflicting demands emerge .
0.3 0.09 Other Resource constraints cause a cascading problem Low - Medium .
Moderate constraints are already in evidence .
0.3 Low .
Although constraints are in evidence , none have yet created a severe problem in Australia .
Constraints will create significant problems , but there is no clear sign that a complete collapse could be triggered in Australia .
0.1 0.03 Total Notional Damage 0.44 ( approx )
Low : 0.0 - 0.3
Medium : 0.3 - 0.6
High : 0.6 - 0.8
Severe : 0.8 - 1.0
Note that most of the factors listed here are external to Australia and out of our control .
Our resource advantage offers us little protection from many of these risks - in fact it increases some of the risk factors .
Note also that I am not using the standard definition for " Impact " .
This table indicates a notional ( roughly ) 50 % chance of a severe setback before my son turns 16 .
How severe ?
Possibly not as severe as one might think .
For example , one of the risks considered is a pandemic .
If it occurred while we were trying to cope with Peak Oil and undertake a serious infrastructure project , then it could set us back .
But here in Australia I think we could cope .
In the closing phases of WWI , Europe was hit by the Spanish Flu pandemic .
Tens of millions of people died , and the fabric of society was strained - but it held together , despite dealing with a war and a pandemic at the same time .
I believe that the fabric of our society can survive two simultaneous hits , as long as they are not severe .
We might be set back by a few years , and certainly there would be suffering , but I believe that if Europe can do it , then Australia as a nation could rise to the challenge .
This , obviously , depends on the nature of the crisis .
I give " Invasion " an impact of 90 % .
If we get invaded , all bets are off !
Likewise a pandemic that caused very high levels of fatalities could be a problem beyond our capacity to cope .
This kind of mathematical game - playing is only intended to provide a gut - level assessment of the magnitude of the accumulated risk .
The number produced is usually artificially high .
Suppose , for example , that China ’s next moon probe finds a huge ocean of Helium - 3 on the moon , and simultaneously scientists in Europe find a breakthrough technology that can immediately utilize Helium - 3 to produce limitless , cheap power .
An event like that would make many of the risks above irrelevant .
But “ positive risks ” like these are not assessed in conventional Risk Analysis .
Negative risks , on the other hand , can simply be added until you reach any Total Notional Risk number that you desire .
The three risks of particular interest are climate change , pandemic , and massive economic downturn .
Although the Total Notional Damage number should be viewed with caution ( since it has been generated using a flawed methodology ) , the Notional Damage numbers are calculated simply by multiplying risk x impact .
These numbers have much more validity .
I am looking at numbers like 0.12 for climate change , 0.09 for pandemic disease , and 0.09 for massive economic downturn .
Numbers this high would normally cause me to either cancel the project or introduce massive risk mitigation .
Many of the numbers on this table are so high that I am forced to question my objectivity .
I have been fairy conservative ( I believe ) with the estimates .
When making estimates , I have tried to put the question into concrete terms .
For example , in the question about a major war with Australian involvement , the concrete question to ask is “ How often will Australia be invaded , or make an all - in commitment to a war that leads to major domestic dislocations ? ”
My answer is “ once ever 500 + years ” ( i.e. an invasion every thousand years and a stupidly aggressive war every thousand years ) , so the chance of this happening in the next 13 years is a bit over 2 % .
The once - in - 500 years number seems quite conservative .
In fact there are no numbers on that list that I am really uncomfortable with .
So there is a credible risk of a severe crisis by 2020 .
I clearly need to hope for the best , but prepare for the worst .
A Range of Cases and Timeframes .
A best case scenario might push Australian society through to Phase 2 ( Business not - quite - as usual ) , while a worst case could push us to Phase 3 ( partial collapse ) or even , possibly , into Phase 4 ( collapse ) .
So any preparations being contemplated must enable us to move from one phase to the next
A worst case scenario would leave us with a devastated economy and could require years for recovery , so preparations need to provide support for a possible extended period and enable us to contribute to the recovery phase .
It is important to remember that during the recovery phase we would still face the massive task of building infrastructure for alternate fuels , mass transport systems , etc .
However we would be starting from a lower industrial base and with a shattered education system ( thus complicating the task of retraining people for the challenge ) .
The recovery process in the worst case scenario would not be pain - free .
At this point it is worth quoting from Dmitry Orlov , who experienced and wrote about the collapse in Russia after the demise of the Soviet Union ( http://energybulletin.net/23259.html ) .
Dmitry said :
( The ) “ Soviet Collapse was absolutely horrible for most people .
Many of them died . ” .... “ In spite of all this , I believe that in every age and circumstance , people can sometimes find not just a means and a reason to survive , but enlightenment , fulfillment , and freedom . ”
My point is that hard times are not always unhappy times .
With sufficient preparation we can improve the likelihood of happiness for ourselves and our loved ones even in the worst - case scenario .
Summary
In Part 2 , I presented these arguments :
Australia will need significant infrastructure changes in the years to come .
A move to alternate fuels and mass transport systems will provide many work opportunities , particularly for engineers , artificers and construction workers .
There is a plausible risk of a serious dislocation that could set this necessary work back .
If this occurs , we will need to spend a significant amount of time recovering before we could undertake the necessary infrastructure changes .
A setback like this is likely to be accompanied by significant trauma .
We now have a picture of the stresses that Australia might face .
Personal preparations will require looking at the scenarios , defining strategies to address the identified risks , then deciding what preparation is required now , so that we can carry out each strategy .
In Part 3 , I will talk in more detail about personal strategies and preparations .

Ministers have adopted a new language for declarations on Islamic terrorism .
In future , fanatics will be referred to as pursuing " anti-Islamic activity " .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said that extremists were behaving contrary to their faith , rather than acting in the name of Islam .
Security officials believe that directly linking terrorism to Islam is inflammatory , and risks alienating mainstream Muslim opinion .
Scroll down for more ...
In her first major speech on radicalisation , Miss Smith repeatedly used the phrase " anti-Islamic " .
In one passage she said : " As so many Muslims in the UK and across the world have pointed out , there is nothing Islamic about the wish to terrorise , nothing Islamic about plotting murder , pain and grief .
" Indeed , if anything , these actions are anti-Islamic ' .
Another section referred to enlisting the Muslim community against " anti-Islamic activity " .
Her words were chosen to reflect new Government strategy on labelling the terrorists and their recruiting agents .
The shift follows a decision taken last year to stop using the phrase " war on terror " , first adopted by U.S. President Bush .
Officials were concerned it could act as a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda , which is determined to manufacture a battle between the values of Islam and the West .
The strategy emerging across Government is to portray terrorists as nothing more than cold - blooded murderers who are not fighting for any religious cause .
Al Qaeda inspired terrorism is instead being described by key figures as " more like a death cult " .
Last night the Home Office stressed that no phrases have been " banned " .
But senior Whitehall sources have made it clear that the " war on terror " and " Islamic extremism " will not be used again by people at the top of Government or those involved in counterterrorism strategy .
Sir Ken Macdonald , the Director of Public Prosecutions , has also said phrases which liken London to a " battlefield " will no longer be used .
But the move led to accusations of " hand - wringing " .
Conservative MP
Philip Davies said no Muslim constituent had ever complained to him about the use of the term " Islamic extremism " .
The Shipley MP added : " Whenever anyone refers to Islamic terrorism , they are not saying all Muslims are terrorists .
" Everybody knows what people mean is terrorists doing it in the name of Islam , misguidedly .
" If the Government spent less time worrying about this , and more time worrying about things such as having effective border controls , we would be getting somewhere . "
In her speech , Miss Smith said extremists who use the internet to radicalise young children would be pursued in the same way as paedophiles .
She will meet members of the online industry in the next few weeks to decide how to crack down on Al Qaedainspired sites .
Illegal material will be tracked down and removed using tactics already deployed against online paedophiles .
Those guilty of grooming youngsters for terrorism could face prosecution under incitement laws .
Miss Smith said : " If we are ready and willing to take action to stop the grooming of vulnerable young people on social networking sites , then I believe we should also take action against those who groom vulnerable people for the purposes of violent extremism . "
Her plans also include a new unit to sift through intelligence gathered by police and security agents .
The unit will be told to " identify , analyse and assess not just the inner circle of extremist groups , but those at risk of falling under their influence " .
Young people found to be falling under the spell of potential terrorists will be targeted for help by community leaders and the authorities .
Outdoor activity centres and sports facilities will be sent guidance to stop them being used as meeting places by fanatics after the July 7 bombers were photographed attending a white water rafting centre in Wales .
Mosques will be helped to root out extremism , with imams encouraged to learn English .
Efforts will be made to improve the access of women to mosques and their management committees .
There will be new advice for universities on how to deal with extremism on campus , and a crackdown on extremist material in libraries and galleries .
A forum of headteachers will be set up to advise on what more can be done to protect children and build bridges between communities .
Youngsters will be taught about all faiths in schools , and £ 2 million will be spent " twinning " schools of different faiths .
Funding will be boosted to allow more youngsters to carry out volunteer work overseas .
The Government also wants to hold more " roadshows " of mainstream Islamic scholarship around the country .
Miss Smith said : " Counter - terrorist policing is not just about the sharp end - the disruption of those who seek to attack us - crucial though that is .
" It must also be about stopping people becoming or supporting terrorists .
We can't , after all , simply arrest our way out of this problem . "

Manufactured evidence ?

In an interview on the The evidence that has been produced , in fact fabricated , is preposterous .
The dates .
If you look at the evidence , the dates that are used in this mortars are written in American date format , putting month first and date second .
Whereas nowhere in the world people use month first and date second .
Everywhere in the world except for the U.S.
And those who fabricated this evidence should listen and learn .
Everybody else in the world uses date , month , year .
That is the order .
CHARLIE ROSE : That says what to you ?
That this evidence is fabricated , as was the evidence that was fabricated before the Iraq war in order to launch an aggression .
This evidence is fabricated and it points to a very dangerous policy that is being pursued by this administration .
CHARLIE ROSE :
What is that dangerous policy pursued by this administration ?
That dangerous policy is to create a crisis , to escape forward .
That is , to blame somebody else for the results of their adventurism , which everybody knew would lead to this disaster .
And then there was the following exchange in Bush 's Q :
What assurances can you give the American people that the intelligence this time will be accurate ?
BUSH : Ed , we know they 're there , we know they 're provided by the Quds force .
We know the Quds force is a part of the Iranian government .
I do n't think we know who picked up the phone and said to the Quds force , go do this , but we know it 's a vital part of the Iranian government .
What matters is , is that we 're responding .
The idea that somehow we 're manufacturing the idea that Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous .
Interesting .
When questioned about the accuracy of the intelligence , Bush did not reply by saying that the collection of evidence was by reliable parties , or that the analysis was thorough .
Instead , he spoke about manufacturing evidence , denying that it took place .

On a cool spring morning a quarter century ago , a place in Pennsylvania called Three Mile Island exploded into the headlines and stopped the US nuclear power industry in its tracks .
What had been billed as the clean , cheap , limitless energy source for a shining future was suddenly too hot to handle .
In the years since , we 've searched for alternatives , pouring billions of dollars into windmills , solar panels , and biofuels .
We 've designed fantastically efficient lightbulbs , air conditioners , and refrigerators .
We 've built enough gas - fired generators to bankrupt California .
But mainly , each year we hack 400 million more tons of coal out of Earth 's crust than we did a quarter century before , light it on fire , and shoot the proceeds into the atmosphere .
The consequences are n't pretty .
Burning coal and other fossil fuels is driving climate change , which is blamed for everything from western forest fires and Florida hurricanes to melting polar ice sheets and flooded Himalayan hamlets .
On top of that , coal - burning electric power plants have fouled the air with enough heavy metals and other noxious pollutants to cause 15,000 premature deaths annually in the US alone , according to a Harvard School of Public Health study .
Believe it or not , a coal - fired plant releases 100 times more radioactive material than an equivalent nuclear reactor - right into the air , too , not into some carefully guarded storage site .
( And , by the way , more than 5,200 Chinese coal miners perished in accidents last year . )
Burning hydrocarbons is a luxury that a planet with 6 billion energy - hungry souls can't afford .
There 's only one sane , practical alternative : nuclear power .
We now know that the risks of splitting atoms pale beside the dreadful toll exacted by fossil fuels .
Radiation containment , waste disposal , and nuclear weapons proliferation are manageable problems in a way that global warming is not .
Unlike the usual green alternatives - water , wind , solar , and biomass - nuclear energy is here , now , in industrial quantities .
Sure , nuke plants are expensive to build - upward of $ 2 billion apiece - but they start to look cheap when you factor in the true cost to people and the planet of burning fossil fuels .
And nuclear is our best hope for cleanly and efficiently generating hydrogen , which would end our other ugly hydrocarbon addiction - dependence on gasoline and diesel for transport .
Some of the world 's most thoughtful greens have discovered the logic of nuclear power , including Gaia theorist James Lovelock , Greenpeace cofounder Patrick Moore , and Britain 's Bishop Hugh Montefiore , a longtime board member of Friends of the Earth ( see " Green vs. Green , " page 82 ) .
Western Europe is quietly backing away from planned nuclear phaseouts .
Finland has ordered a big reactor specifically to meet the terms of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change .
China 's new nuke plants - 26 by 2025 - are part of a desperate effort at smog control .
Even the shell - shocked US nuclear industry is coming out of its stupor .
The 2001 report of Vice President Cheney 's energy task force was only the most high profile in a series of pro-nuke developments .
Nuke boosters are especially buoyed by more efficient plant designs , streamlined licensing procedures , and the prospect of federal subsidies .
In fact , new plants are on the way , however tentatively .
Three groups of generating companies have entered a bureaucratic maze expected to lead to formal applications for plants by 2008 .
If everything breaks right , the first new reactors in decades will be online by 2014 .
If this seems ambitious , it 's not ; the industry hopes merely to hold on to nuclear 's current 20 percent of the rapidly growing US electric power market .
That 's not nearly enough .
We should be shooting to match France , which gets 77 percent of its electricity from nukes .
It 's past time for a decisive leap out of the hydrocarbon era , time to send King Coal and , soon after , Big Oil shambling off to their well - deserved final resting places - maybe on a nostalgic old steam locomotive .
Besides , would n't it be a blast to barrel down the freeway in a hydrogen Hummer with a clean conscience as your copilot ?
Or not to feel like a planet killer every time you flick on the A/C ?
That 's how the future could be , if only we would get over our fear of the nuclear bogeyman and forge ahead - for real this time - into the atomic age .
The granola crowd likes to talk about conservation and efficiency , and surely substantial gains can be made in those areas .
But energy is not a luxury people can do without , like a gym membership or hair gel .
The developed world built its wealth on cheap power - burning firewood , coal , petroleum , and natural gas , with carbon emissions the inevitable byproduct .
Indeed , material progress can be tracked in what gets pumped out of smokestacks .
An hour of coal - generated 100 - watt electric light creates 0.05 pounds of atmospheric carbon , a bucket of ice makes 0.3 pounds , an hour 's car ride 5 .
The average American sends nearly half a ton of carbon spewing into the atmosphere every month .
Europe and Japan are a little more economical , but even the most remote forest - burning peasants happily do their part .
And the worst - by far - is yet to come .
An MIT study forecasts that worldwide energy demand could triple by 2050 .
China could build a Three Gorges Dam every year forever and still not meet its growing demand for electricity .
Even the carbon reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol - which pointedly exempts developing countries like China - will be a drop in the atmospheric sewer .
What is a rapidly carbonizing world to do ?
The high - minded answer , of course , is renewables .
But the notion that wind , water , solar , or biomass will save the day is at least as fanciful as the once - popular idea that nuclear energy would be too cheap to meter .
Jesse Ausubel , director of the human environment program at New York 's Rockefeller University , calls renewable energy sources " false gods " - attractive but powerless .
They 're capital - and land - intensive , and solar is not yet remotely cost - competitive .
Despite all the hype , tax breaks , and incentives , the proportion of US electricity production from renewables has actually fallen in the past 15 years , from 11.0 percent to 9.1 percent .
The decline would be even worse without hydropower , which accounts for 92 percent of the world 's renewable electricity .
While dams in the US are under attack from environmentalists trying to protect wild fish populations , the Chinese are building them on an ever grander scale .
But even China 's autocrats can't get past Nimby .
Stung by criticism of the monumental Three Gorges project - which required the forcible relocation of 1 million people - officials have suspended an even bigger project on the Nu Jiang River in the country 's remote southwest .
Or maybe someone in Beijing questioned the wisdom of reacting to climate change with a multibillion - dollar bet on rainfall .
Solar power does n't look much better .
Its number - one problem is cost :
While the price of photovoltaic cells has been slowly dropping , solar - generated electricity is still four times more expensive than nuclear ( and more than five times the cost of coal ) .
Maybe someday we 'll all live in houses with photovoltaic roof tiles , but in the real world , a run -of - the - mill 1,000 - megawatt photovoltaic plant will require about 60 square miles of panes alone .
In other words , the largest industrial structure ever built .
Wind is more promising , which is one reason it's the lone renewable attracting serious interest from big - time equipment manufacturers like General Electric .
But even though price and performance are expected to improve , wind , like solar , is inherently fickle , hard to capture , and widely dispersed .
And wind turbines take up a lot of space ; Ausubel points out that the wind equivalent of a typical utility plant would require 300 square miles of turbines plus costly transmission lines from the wind - scoured fields of , say , North Dakota .
Alternatively , there 's California 's Altamont Pass , where 5,400 windmills slice and dice some 1,300 birds of prey annually .
What about biomass ?
Ethanol is clean , but growing the amount of cellulose required to shift US electricity production to biomass would require farming - no wilting organics , please - an area the size of 10 Iowas .
Among fossil fuels , natural gas holds some allure ; it emits a third as much carbon as coal .
That 's an improvement but not enough if you 're serious about rolling back carbon levels .
Washington 's favorite solution is so - called clean coal , ballyhooed in stump speeches by both President Bush ( who offered a $ 2 billion research program ) and challenger John Kerry ( who upped the ante to $ 10 billion ) .
But most of the work so far has been aimed at reducing acid rain by cutting sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions , and more recently gasifying coal to make it burn cleaner .
Actual zero-emissions coal is still a lab experiment that even fans say could double or triple generating costs .
It would also leave the question of what to do with 1 million tons of extracted carbon each year .
The last US nuke plant to be built was ordered in 1973 , yet nuclear power is growing here as well .
With clever engineering and smart management , nukes have steadily increased their share of generating capacity in the US .
The 103 reactors operating in the US pump out electricity at more than 90 percent of capacity , up from 60 percent when Three Mile Island made headlines .
That increase is the equivalent of adding 40 new reactors , without bothering anyone 's backyard or spewing any more carbon into the air .
So atomic power is less expensive than it used to be - but could it possibly be cost - effective ?
Even before Three Mile Island sank , the US nuclear industry was foundering on the shoals of economics .
Regulatory delays and billion - dollar construction - cost overruns turned the business into a financial nightmare .
But increasing experience and efficiency gains have changed all that .
Current operating costs are the lowest ever - 1.82 cents per kilowatt - hour versus 2.13 cents for coal - fired plants and 3.69 cents for natural gas .
The ultimate vindication of nuclear economics is playing out in the stock market :
Over the past five years , the stocks of leading nuclear generating companies such as Exelon and Entergy have more than doubled .
Indeed , Exelon is feeling so flush that it bought New Jersey 's Public Service Enterprise Group in December , adding four reactors to its former roster of 17 .
This remarkable success suggests that nuclear energy realistically could replace coal in the US without a cost increase and ultimately lead the way to a clean , green future .
The trick is to start building nuke plants and keep building them at a furious pace .
Anything less leaves carbon in the climatic driver 's seat .
A decade ago , anyone thinking about constructing nuclear plants in the US would have been dismissed as out of touch with reality .
But today , for the first time since the building of Three Mile Island , new nukes in the US seem possible .
Thanks to improvements in reactor design and increasing encouragement from Washington , DC , the nuclear industry is posed for unlikely revival .
" All the planets seem to be coming into alignment , " says David Brown , VP for congressional affairs at Exelon .
The original US nuclear plants , built during the 1950s and '60s , were descended from propulsion units in 1950s - vintage nuclear submarines , now known as generation I . During the ' 80s and '90s , when new construction halted in the US , the major reactor makers - GE Power Systems , British - owned Westinghouse , France 's Framatome ( part of Areva ) , and Canada 's AECL - went after customers in Europe .
This new round of business led to system improvements that could eventually , after some prototyping , be deployed back in the US .
Prodded by the Cheney report , the US Department of Energy agreed in 2002 to pick up the tab of the first hurdle - getting from engineering design to working blueprints .
Three groups of utility companies and reactor makers have stepped up for the program , optimistically dubbed Nuclear Power 2010 .
The government 's bill to taxpayers for this stage of development could top $ 500 million , but at least we 'll get working reactors rather than " promising technologies . "
But newer , better designs do n't free the industry from the intense public oversight that has been nuclear power 's special burden from the start .
Believe it or not , Three Mile Island was n't the ultimate nightmare ; that would be Shoreham , the Long Island power plant shuttered in 1994 after a nine - year legal battle , without ever having sold a single electron .
Construction was already complete when opponents challenged the plant 's application for an operating license .
Wall Street wo n't invest billions in new plants ( $ 5.5 billion in Shoreham 's case ) without a clear path through the maze of judges and regulators .
Shoreham did n't die completely in vain .
The 1992 Energy Policy
Act aims to forestall such debacles by authorizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue combined construction and operating licenses .
It also allows the NRC to pre-certify specific reactor models and the energy companies to bank preapproved sites .
Utility executives fret that no one has ever road - tested the new process , which still requires public hearings and shelves of supporting documents .
An idle reactor site at Browns Ferry , Alabama , could be an early test case ; the Tennessee Valley Authority is exploring options to refurbish it rather than start from scratch .
Meanwhile , Congress looks ready to provide a boost to the nuclear energy industry .
Pete Domenici ( R - New Mexico ) , chair of the Senate 's energy committee and the patron saint of nuclear power in Washington , has vowed to revive last year 's energy bill , which died in the Senate .
Earlier versions included a 1.85 cent per-kilowatt - hour production tax credit for the first half - dozen nuke plants to come online .
That could add up to as much as $ 8 billion in federal outlays and should go a long way toward luring Wall Street back into the fray .
As pork goes , the provision is easy to defend .
Nuclear power 's extraordinary startup costs and safety risks make it a special case for government intervention .
And the amount is precisely the same bounty Washington spends annually in tax credits for wind , biomass , and other zero-emission kilowattage .
Safer plants , more sensible regulation , and even a helping hand from Congress - all are on the way .
What 's still missing is a place to put radioactive waste .
By law , US companies that generate nuclear power pay the Feds a tenth of a cent per kilowatt - hour to dispose of their spent fuel .
The fund - currently $ 24 billion and counting - is supposed to finance a permanent waste repository , the ill - fated Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
Two decades ago when the payments started , opening day was scheduled for January 31 , 1998 .
But the Nevada facility remains embroiled in hearings , debates , and studies , and waste is piling up at 30 - odd sites around the country .
Nobody will build a nuke plant until Washington offers a better answer than " keep piling . "
At Yucca Mountain , perfection has been the enemy of adequacy .
It 's fun to discuss what the design life of an underground nuclear waste facility ought to be .
One hundred years ?
Two hundred years ?
How about 100,000 ?
A quarter of a million ?
Science fiction meets the US government budgeting process .
In court !
But throwing waste into a black hole at Yucca Mountain is n't such a great idea anyway .
For one thing , in coming decades we might devise better disposal methods , such as corrosion - proof containers that can withstand millennia of heat and moisture .
For another , used nuclear fuel can be recycled as a source for the production of more energy .
Either way , it 's clear that the whole waste disposal problem has been misconstrued .
We do n't need a million - year solution .
A hundred years will do just fine - long enough to let the stuff cool down and allow us to decide what to do with it .
The name for this approach is interim storage :
Find a few patches of isolated real estate - we 're not talking about taking it over for eternity - and pour nice big concrete pads ; add floodlights , motion detectors , and razor wire ; truck in nuclear waste in bombproof 20 - foot - high concrete casks .
Voilé : safe storage while you wait for either Yucca Mountain or plan B .
Two dozen reactor sites around the country already have their own interim facilities ; a private company has applied with the NRC to open one on the Goshute Indian reservation in Skull Valley , Utah .
Establishing a half - dozen federally managed sites is closer to the right idea .
Domenici says he 'll introduce legislation this year for a national interim storage system .
A handful of new US plants will be a fine start , but the real goal has to be dethroning King Coal and - until something better comes along - pushing nuclear power out front as the world 's default energy source .
Kicking carbon cold turkey wo n't be easy , but it can be done .
Four crucial steps can help increase the momentum : Regulate carbon emissions , revamp the fuel cycle , rekindle innovation in nuclear technology , and , finally , replace gasoline with hydrogen .
• Regulate carbon emissions .
Nuclear plants have to account for every radioactive atom of waste .
Meanwhile , coal - fired plants dump tons of deadly refuse into the atmosphere at zero cost .
It 's time for that free ride to end , but only the government can make it happen .
The industry seems ready to pay up .
Andy
White , CEO of GE Energy 's nuclear division , recently asked a roomful of US utility executives what they thought about the possibility of regulating carbon emissions .
The idea did n't faze them .
" The only question any of them had , " he says , " was when and how much . "
A flat - out carbon tax is almost certainly a nonstarter in Washington .
But an arrangement in which all energy producers are allowed a limited number of carbon pollution credits to use or sell could pass muster ; after all , this kind of cap - and - trade scheme is already a fact of life for US utilities with a variety of other pollutants .
Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman have been pushing legislation such a system .
This would send a clear message to utility executives that fossil energy 's free pass is over .
• Recycle nuclear fuel .
Here 's a fun fact : Spent nuclear fuel - the stuff intended for permanent disposal at Yucca Mountain - retains 95 percent of its energy content .
Imagine what Toyota could do for fuel efficiency if 95 percent of the average car 's gasoline passed through the engine and out the tailpipe .
In France , Japan , and Britain , nuclear engineers do the sensible thing : recycle .
Alone among the nuclear powers , the US does n't , for reasons that have nothing to do with nuclear power .
Recycling spent fuel - the technical word is reprocessing - is one way to make the key ingredient of a nuclear bomb , enriched uranium .
In 1977 , Jimmy Carter , the only nuclear engineer ever to occupy the White House , banned reprocessing in the US in favor of a so - called once - through fuel cycle .
Four decades later , more than a dozen countries reprocess or enrich uranium , including North Korea and Iran .
At this point , hanging onto spent fuel from US reactors does little good abroad and real mischief at home .
The Bush administration has reopened the door with modest funding to resume research into the nuclear fuel cycle .
The president himself has floated a proposal to provide all comers with a guaranteed supply of reactor fuel in exchange for a promise not to reprocess spent fuel themselves .
Other proposals would create a global nuclear fuel company , possibly under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
This company would collect , reprocess , and distribute fuel to every nation in the world , thus keeping potential bomb fixings out of circulation .
In the short term , reprocessing would maximize resources and minimize the problem of how to dispose of radioactive waste .
In fact , it would eliminate most of the waste from nuclear power production .
Over decades , it could also ease pressure on uranium supplies .
The world 's existing reserves are generally reckoned sufficient to withstand 50 years of rapid nuclear expansion without a significant price increase .
In a pinch , there 's always the ocean , whose 4.5 billion tons of dissolved uranium can be extracted today at 5 to 10 times the cost of conventional mining .
Uranium is so cheap today that reprocessing is more about reducing waste than stretching the fuel supply .
But advanced breeder reactors , which create more fuel as they generate power , could well be the economically competitive choice - and renewable as well .
• Rekindle innovation .
Although nuclear technology has come a long way since Three Mile Island , the field is hardly a hotbed of innovation .
Government - funded research - such as the DOE's Next Generation Nuclear Plant program - is aimed at designing advanced reactors , including high temperature , gas - cooled plants of the kind being built in China and South Africa and fast - breeder reactors that will use uranium 60 times more efficiently than today 's reactors .
Still , the nuclear industry suffers from its legacy of having been born under a mushroom cloud and raised by your local electric company .
A tight leash on nuclear R&D may be good , even necessary .
But there 's nothing like a little competition to spur creativity .
That 's reason enough to want to see US companies squarely back on the nuclear power field - research is great , but more and smarter buyers ultimately drive quality up and prices down .
In fact , the possibility of a nuclear gold rush - not just a modest rebirth - depends on economics as much as technology .
The generation IV pebble - bed reactors being developed in China and South Africa get attention for their meltdown - proof designs .
( See " Let a Thousand Reactors Bloom , " issue 12.09 . )
But it 's their low capital cost and potential for fast , modular construction that could blow the game open , as surely as the PC did for computing .
As long as investments come in $ 2 billion increments , purchase orders will be few and far between .
At $ 300 million a pop for safe , clean energy , watch the floodgates open around the world .
• Replace gasoline with hydrogen .
If a single change could truly ignite nuclear power , it 's the grab bag of technologies and wishful schemes traveling under the rubric of the hydrogen economy .
Leaving behind petroleum is as important to the planet 's future as eliminating coal .
The hitch is that it takes energy to extract hydrogen from substances like methane and water .
Where will it come from ?
Today , the most common energy source for producing hydrogen is natural gas , followed by oil .
It 's conceivable that renewables could do it in limited quantities .
By the luck of physics , though , two things nuclear reactors do best - generate both electricity and very high temperatures - are exactly what it takes to produce hydrogen most efficiently .
Last November , the DOE's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory showed how a single next - gen nuke could produce the hydrogen equivalent of 400,000 gallons of gasoline every day .
Nuclear energy 's potential for freeing us not only from coal but also oil holds the promise of a bright green future for the US and the world at large .
The more seriously you take the idea of global warming , the more seriously you have to take nuclear power .
Clean coal , solar - powered roof tiles , wind farms in North Dakota - they 're all pie in the emissions - free sky .
Sure , give them a shot .
But zero - carbon reactors are here and now .
We know we can build them .
Their price tag is no mystery .
They fit into the existing electric grid without a hitch .
Flannel - shirted environmentalists who fight these realities run the risk of ending up with as much soot on their hands as the slickest coal - mining CEO .
America 's voracious energy appetite does n't have to be a bug - it can be a feature .
Shanghai , Seoul , and Séo Paolo are more likely to look to Los Angeles or Houston as a model than to some solar - powered idyll .
Energy technology is no different than any other ; innovation can change all the rules .
But if the best we can offer the developing world is bromides about energy independence , we 'll deserve the carbon - choked nightmare of a planet we get .
Nuclear energy is the big bang still reverberating .
It 's the power to light a city in a lump the size of a soda can .
Peter Huber and Mark Mills have written an iconoclastic new book on energy , The Bottomless Well .
They see nuclear power as merely the latest in a series of technologies that will gradually eliminate our need to carve up huge swaths of the planet .
" Energy is n't the problem .
Energy is the solution , " they write .
" Energy begets more energy .
The more of it we capture and put to use , the more readily we will capture still more . "
The best way to avoid running out of fossil fuels is to switch to something better .
The Stone Age famously did not end for lack of stones , and neither should we wait for the last chunk of anthracite to flicker out before we kiss hydrocarbons good - bye .
Especially not when something cleaner , safer , more efficient , and more abundant is ready to roll .
It 's time to get real .
Green vs. Green
The environmental movement , once staunchly antinuclear , is facing resistance from within .
by Amanda Griscom Little
From Greenpeace to the Green Party , some of the most prominent environmental groups today made their reputations in the 1970s as opponents of nuclear power .
So it was no wonder that greens were vexed last summer when prime minister Tony Blair proposed a new generation of nuclear power plants for Britain to confront the problem of climate change .
But what galled them even more was the response to Blair from Hugh Montefiore , a former Anglican bishop and longtime trustee of Friends of the Earth .
Writing in the British journal The Tablet in October , Montefiore committed what colleagues viewed as the ultimate betrayal : " I have now come to the conclusion that the solution [ to global warming ] is to make more use of nuclear energy . "
When Montefiore told fellow trustees that he planned to speak out , they made him resign his post .
Montefiore is n't the only dyed - in - the - wool green who has been exiled for advocating nuclear power .
Greenpeace cofounder Patrick Moore left the organization after embracing atomic energy .
British biologist James Lovelock , whose Gaia theory was an environmental watchword before he turned pro-nuke , is now persona non grata within the movement .
" There are members of my former organization who would agree with me but have not gone public about the matter , " Montefiore laments .
" If only we had a few more people who would stick their necks out , it would help . "
Maybe not .
Consider the green reaction to the National Commission on Energy Policy , whose board of directors includes a Harvard professor emeritus of environmental policy and a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
In December , the commission released a 150 - page report that proposed reinvigorating the nuclear industry with billions in subsidies .
The US must seek " a substantial expansion " of atomic power to counter climate change , the report said .
Environmental groups bristled .
The NRDC rejected the report 's nuclear section as " old - style thinking . "
Members of Greenpeace , the Sierra Club , and the Union of Concerned Scientists heaved their own brickbats .
So what would it take for environmentalists to accept nukes ?
Although green opinions vary , sources in the movement say much of the resistance would soften if the industry dealt with four persistent issues .
The top priority for many environmentalists is to counter proliferation of nuclear weapons .
To stem the creation of weapons - grade materials , they want to prohibit plants from recycling fuel and install robust security at reactor fuel production facilities .
Second , to diminish the risk of Chernobyl - style accidents , they 'd like to see aging plants updated , safety protocols strengthened , and oversight tightened .
Third , greens want a secure place to put waste .
Yucca Mountain in Nevada , they say , needs to be proven capable of holding radioactive refuse for the hundreds of thousands of years it will take to decay ; alternatively , a national system of short - term interim storage might be acceptable .
Fourth , environmentalists insist that uranium mines , which are notorious polluters , employ cleaner extraction methods and submit to tougher environmental regulations .
" If our concerns were thoroughly addressed , there could be a greater role for commercial nuclear power that we would support , " says Geoffrey Fettus , senior project attorney at the NRDC .
" But the devil is in the details , and the industry has n't acknowledged that the problems even exist . "
While none of the leading environmental groups are going to lead the nuclear charge , insiders say the Union of Concerned Scientists has a growing pro-nuke faction .
But do n't look for a trend .
" I want to drive a stake through the heart of the nuclear industry , " says Greenpeace senior nuclear policy analyst Jim Ricchio .
" I do n't expect that to change . "

Green vs. Green
One guy from fotoduet .ru got a trip to a Russian space agency , near the Moscow city .
That ’s a place where all the Russian austronauts , as well as commercial space travellers are being trained before their trip to space .
Here is his photos from that place , with some comments .
This is the place where the astronauts live during their training period .
All the servicemen with their families , engineers and other people working in the Russian space agency live here also , total there are 7500 people in this small town around the space agency .
That ’s a lobby of one of the training centers .
“ We keep manned MIR mission going ”
Yeah , under the water now .
From this building the manned MIR station was controlled .
This is a full - size working model of Russian space station “ MIR ” which was taken down to ocean recently .
That ’s a monument of Gagarin , the first man in space ever .
He says “ Preved ! ” ( hello , on russian ) to all the people entering Russian space agency .
That ’s a full - size simulator of descent vehicle .
One more simulator .
Some Russian space artefact .
Another simulator .
From this room some of the simulators are being controlled .
Check out the phone .
The simulator from inside .
It ’s very cramped in there .
Simulator control panel , back from 70s .
Cool things back from 70s .
The scientific branch of space agency .
This is a Russian space station inside of a giant pool , underwater .
This is the inner corridor of these pool with windows coming inside the pool where the station is located .
Instructors control astronauts from here .
These are parts of the current International space station .
This is the bathroom inside of Russian segment of ISS .
You can easily guess about what is for the thing with the white cover .
And the thing with the yellow cover works like vaccum cleaner , used for the urination needs of the astronauts .
It ’s being said that women - astronauts experience difficulties with using that thing .
This one is a fully - working part of Russian ISS module .
It works and is used to train Russian astronauts .
It ’s being built totally from Russian components , according to its exterior some of the components could come back from 70s .
This is the passage between two rooms in ISS .
That ’s the author himself .
This place may look familiar to some of you , because right from the same place in space astronauts communicate with control center on the Earth .
That ’s a fan .
You can take it from the wall and use for your needs .
All the “ on - board ” documentation is being stored in the soft bags .
Those handles are all over the ISS modules .
In weightlessness state in space they come very handy .
Those headphones do n’t look so stylish but you can through them down from the Empire State Building and they would not break .
Another copy of Russian International Space Station module .
A lot of handles and inside the walls there are scientific equipment .
That ’s a commanding point , the one from which astronauts talk with Earth .
Same place , now without any astronauts as they can be seen from the Earth .
This is how this ISS modules look from outside .
They are now covered with cellophane because renovation occurs in space agency these days .
That ’s a centrifuge , astronauts here are being trained to stand overload up to 8G , though the device can produce 30G overloads .
The cabin inside rotates on two axis .
The room with the centrifuge is being locked as a bank depositary .
And that ’s some shots from the “ Museum of Austronatics ” in Russian Space agency .
That ’s special pants .
Astronauts use them to make extra blood flush to legs , because in space they do n’t use legs much and legs can suffer without enough blood .
This suit is being used to stimulate austronaut ’s muscles .
You can hardly move in this suit thus your muscles work hard and receive training .
It ’s important in space .
Though it ’s being said austronauts do n’t like to use this suit , but they have to .
That was a Gagarin room , the guy who flew to space for the first time .
All Russian austronauts come here to sit quitely for a couple of minutes right before the launch .

The Finnish Defense Ministry said in a statement that a Russian Ilyushin - 76 military cargo plane violated Finnish airspace on Friday morning .
The statement added the plane had penetrated Finnish airspace to a depth of about 4.5 kilometers at about 10:35 a.m. local time on Friday and was in Finnish airspace for a few minutes .
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said Friday that airspace violation must not happen , adding he wanted Russia to explain the latest one .
Finnish Frontier Guard has begun an investigation into the incident .
Finnish Defense Minister Jyri Hakamies told Finnish media that the matter would be dealt with between Finnish and Russian authorities .
Airspace violations by Russian aircraft have been detected in August 2005 and again in April 2006 .

It makes perfect sense for Apple to release its Safari web browser for Windows , but the question is :
What right - thinking Windows user would want it ?
Steve Jobs ' unexpected announcement Monday that the public beta of Safari 3 runs on Windows left the crowd at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco murmuring its approval .
But the initiative seems to rely on a domino theory fueled by infatuation .
Apple is hoping there are Windows users so in love with their iPods and iTunes that they will also download Safari .
Then they 'll fall in love with that , and the next thing you know they 'll be down at the Apple Store fishing for their credit cards .
There 's only one problem with that scenario – Safari sucks .
A lot of Mac users wo n't run the browser ( I 'm one of them ) , so why would anyone run it on Windows ?
On my Mac , Safari is buggy and unreliable .
It 's always crashing , and it does n't offer basic features like remembering all the tabs you have open after you quit ( or more likely , after it crashes ) .
Until now , it did n't even warn you before closing multiple tabs , although the new version of Safari fixes this .
Firefox is getting a little bloated these days , but it 's a better browser .
For Windows users , the browser market is already far too crowded – who needs anything other than Internet Explorer or Firefox ?
Safari is one browser too many .
A couple of Windows users I 've talked to would happily ditch Firefox for Internet Explorer if only IE supported some of Mozilla browser 's handy plug-ins .
Wired magazine contributing editor Fred Vogelstein for one would love to run Explorer .
( Vogelstein is also the only person in the world who runs Windows XP full time on his new MacBook ) .
Safari does n't support plug-ins ( at least plug - ins that are n't hacks ) and it certainly does n't benefit from a thriving community of plug - in developers the way Firefox does .
These days , browsers are taken for granted – you can't even give this stuff away .
But I 'm sure there will be millions of downloads by looky - loos curious to see if Safari is better .
One developer at WWDC suggested Safari might be more secure than IE if it does n't run ActiveX controls ( ActiveX is a source of much malicious code ) .
Of course , Apple has good reasons to offer Safari to Windows users .
The company has little to lose .
It may gain new users , and there 's no danger that Microsoft will try to crush Apple like it crushed Netscape – the browser wars are over .
Plus , Apple is more likely to take market share from Firefox than IE .
Apple is also throwing a bone to iPhone developers .
If developers create software for the highly anticipated gadget using Jobs ' " sweet " Safari development plan , they get to run those apps in Safari on Windows for free .
Maybe this is part of Apple 's plan to create a plug - in platform for Safari – by offering it up as a big platform for developers .
And maybe in a year or so Safari will be a better browser because of it .
Perhaps most importantly , Apple is turning WebKit – the engine that drives Safari – into a big open - source development project to rival Mozilla .
One developer at WWDC said many open - source programmers are very excited about Apple 's support for WebKit .
Unlike Mozilla , which has only a nonprofit foundation to back its efforts , two big companies are pushing WebKit : Apple and Nokia , which is using the technology for some of its smartphones .
So Apple has every reason to dangle Safari in front of Windows users .
But right now , I can't see any good reasons for Windows users to take the bait .

but supposedly there 's an all day demo going down on October 25th at 4 Columbus Circle if you happen to be in the New York area .
And if you do go , try to show up in a cab just to be ironic .
Anyone who reads the fine site Book of Joe knows that the man behind the blogging empire is religiously devoted to working out while writing , and prides himself on having integrated a treadmill into his workspace .
Well manufacturer Steelcase thinks that this trend has grown beyond one individual multitasking in his underwear , and is poised to introduce a nicely - designed product called the Walkstation which seems more at home in a CEO 's office than your messy living room .
Not many details are available on this converged piece of furniture co-designed by the Mayo Clinic 's Dr. James Levine ( who 's been working in this specialized field for at least two years , apparently ) , : We 've learned -- unsurprisingly , from the Joe mentioned above -- that this rig will retail for a cool $ 6,500 , thereby making it the Rolls Royce of integrated workstations .
Thanks ,
Joe , and keep , um , running for the stars !
Whoops , guess there 's no demo going on after all .
You can still show up to that address , we guess , but you certainly wo n't have the good time you would have had working and exercising simultaneously .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Late last summer , Bank of America and its deal - hungry chief Kenneth Lewis won kudos for a $ 2 billion investment in Countrywide Financial , the once high - flying mortgage lender hit hard by the housing slump .
In one stroke , Lewis erased his reputation as a serial over - payer with the kind of convertible preferred stock deal that arbitrage traders dream of .
In exchange for its $ 2 billion , Bank of America secured the right to buy Countrywide ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) stock at $ 18 , a tidy 21 percent discount over the price at the time .
Lewis , it seemed , had deftly locked in an instant $ 424 million profit for the bank .
Nobody 's congratulating Bank of America these days .
As Countrywide shares tank and speculation mounts that the company will be forced into bankruptcy , the bank 's stake has plunged in value , to about $ 560 million .
Now Bank of America faces a tough choice :
It can buy Countrywide outright , pour even more money into the lender , or simply bide its time and hope for the best .
Whatever it does , Bank of America no longer appears so savvy .
And Lewis , who 's been criticized for paying top dollar for , among other companies , credit - card lender MBNA ( $ 35 billion ) and U.S. Trust ( $ 3.3 billion ) , is once again looking like a spendthrift .
Bank of America and Countrywide declined comment .
Their deal looked so simple when it was announced in August .
In return for its cash , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) got a 7.25 percent yield on convertible preferred stock and the right to buy 111 million Countrywide shares , equal to a 16 percent stake .
The bank also got the right of first refusal on any future Countrywide deals and stood in front of the creditors ' line should the lender go bankrupt .
Lewis and Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo , known for his perpetual tan and wide grin , somberly proclaimed the importance of the investment in stabilizing the then - turbulent mortgage secondary markets .
The markets seemed to agree .
The celebration did n't last long .
The mortgage market has continued to tumble along with Countrywide 's stock .
Meanwhile , the company faces a barrage of federal and state investigations of its lending and accounting practices .
As Countrywide 's troubles have mounted , so has speculation that it would file for bankruptcy .
On Tuesday , for the second time in five months , Countrywide was forced to take the unusual move of issuing a press release denying that it was planning to seek protection from its creditors .
On Wednesday , the Calabasas , Calif . - based lender released what it claimed was further proof of its stability :
The amount of mortgages funded had risen above expectations , which is ordinarily good news .
Investors , however , were n't buying it , and for good reason .
Buried deep in Countrywide 's release were some troubling numbers : Foreclosures had doubled to 1.4 percent of unpaid principal at its key servicing unit .
Late payments also skyrocketed , to 7.2 percent of unpaid balances , up from 4.6 percent .
Countrywide shares have plunged 11 percent since this week 's damage control began .
Now Bank of America faces a quandary :
The value of its investment is falling fast , but any move - whether to buy Countrywide , invest more money , or sit tight - carries a host of potential liabilities .
If it buys Countrywide , Bank of America gets a nationally known franchise and potentially millions of clients for its suite of higher - margin consumer banking offerings , to say nothing of becoming America 's most important home lender and the further economies of scale that brings .
On the downside , Bank of America would also get a lender whose credit quality is deteriorating rapidly - and who has sworn off high - margin subprime lending , essentially eliminating what was once its most attractive business .
Countrywide is now banking on razor - thin margin conforming loans .
There is also the matter of Bank of America 's appetite for Countrywide 's portfolio .
Ten percent of the lender 's portfolio is invested in subprime mortgage securities , including billions worth of securitized and " raw " home equity loans ( known as " HELOCS " on Wall Street ) and adjustable rate mortgage securities , or ARMS , whose interest rates might prove very troubling to struggling homeowners .
This risky mix may be too much for credit - sensitive Bank of America to stomach .
It could try to shed billions of dollars worth of these securities , but finding buyers would be difficult :
There 's zero appetite for these investments among potential buyers , who would accept nothing short of fire - sale prices .
Brokers like Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , meanwhile , have their own , well - documented balance sheet problems .
Option B - dumping more money into Countrywide - is unlikely too , at least in the short run .
Upping its investment means believing that Countrywide 's operating environment is stabilizing or even may slightly improve .
To do that , however , Bank of America has to overlook Wednesday 's disclosure about rising foreclosure and late payment rates .
That wo n't be easy .
This leaves the third option , the one that Bank of America is most likely to pursue : Keeping its fingers - crossed .
Still , it can't be easy for Bank of America 's shareholders to watch more than billion dollars evaporate on what was clearly no more than a timing trade on the mortgage market .
They 've already watched Bank of America shares fall 25 percent since October , as concerns grow over the health of the U.S. banking sector .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Saudi businessman
Tarek bin Laden , half - brother of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , became the first customer to sign up for the $ 80 million Aerion supersonic business jet on Monday .
The retirement in 2003 of the Concorde , which ferried the rich and famous across the Atlantic for 27 years at speeds up to 1,630 mph ( 2,625 kph ) , has opened a new market niche for planes faster than current business jets , Aerion believes .
“ Initial demand for the Aerion jet will come from Europe and the Middle East , ” said Niall Olver , chief executive of ExecuJet , which will handle marketing of the plane outside the United States .
ExecuJet is looking for 40 customers with deposits of $ 250,000 each .
“ Market demand has driven our decision to begin accepting deposits , ” said Brian Barents , Aerion ’s vice chairman .
The Reno , Nevada - based company formed in 2002 and unveiled the design for its needle - nosed jet in 2004 .
The company has since been doing wind tunnel testing to advance its design .
Seating eight to 12 passengers , plans call for a top speed of Mach 1.6 and a range of 4,500 miles .
02138 , which refers to Harvard College ’s ZIP code in Cambridge , Mass. , and consists primarily of articles about Harvard and Harvard alumni , published an article last week about the genesis of Facebook and the resulting lawsuit .
The piece is sympathetic to the plaintiffs ’ account and questions the validity of Mr. Zuckerberg ’s claims .
The article relied in part on documents submitted in the lawsuit , in Federal District Court in Boston , that were ordered sealed by the judge in the case , Douglas P. Woodlock .
On its Web site , 02138 posted not only the article , but also the documents , which include Mr. Zuckerberg ’s handwritten application for admission to Harvard and an excerpt from an online journal he kept as a student that contains biting comments about himself and others .
Luke O’Brien , the freelance reporter who wrote the article , said that he had done nothing wrong in obtaining the documents and that neither side in the lawsuit had improperly leaked them to him .
He said he had obtained the papers in mid-September from the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston , which considered a part of the case , where a clerk apparently made a mistake and let him read and copy sealed documents , along with those that were still supposed to be open to the public .
“ There were a whole bunch of manila envelopes taped shut , clearly sealed , and I did not open those , ” he said .
Some of the pages he copied were stamped “ Confidential ” or “ Redacted . ”
Bom Kim , founder and editor of 02138 , which is not affiliated with the university or its alumni association , said that gave him pause .
The serpent ’s tails coil together menacingly .
A horn juts sharply from its head .
The creature looks as if it might be swimming through a sea of stars .
Or is it making its way up a sheer basalt cliff ?
For Bruce Masse , an environmental archaeologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory , there is no confusion as he looks at this ancient petroglyph , scratched into a rock by a Native American shaman .
“ You ca n’t tell me that is n’t a comet , ” he says .
In Masse ’s interpretation , the petroglyph commemorates a comet that streaked across the sky just a few years before Europeans came to this area of New Mexico .
But that event is a minor blip compared to what he is really after .
Masse believes that he has uncovered evidence that a gigantic comet crashed into the Indian Ocean several thousand years ago and nearly wiped out all life on the planet .
What ’s more , he thinks that clues about the catastrophe are hiding in plain sight , embedded in the creation stories of cultural groups around the world .
His hypothesis depends on a major reinterpretation of many different mythologies and raises questions about how frequently major asteroid impacts occur .
What scientists know about such collisions is based mainly on a limited survey of craters around the world and on the moon .
Only 185 craters on Earth have been identified , and almost all are on dry land , leaving largely unexamined the 70 percent of the planet covered by water .
Even among those on dry land , many of the craters have been recognized only recently .
It is possible that Earth has been a target of more meteors and comets than scientists have suspected .
Masse ’s epiphany came while poring over Hawaiian oral histories regarding the goddess Pele and wondering what they might reveal about the lava flows that episodically destroy human settlements and create new tracts of land .
He reasoned that even though the stories are often clouded by exaggerations and mystical explanations , many may refer to actual incidents .
He tested his hypothesis by cross-checking carbon - 14 ages for the lava flows against dates included in royal Hawaiian genealogies .
The result : Several flows matched up with the specific reigns associated with them in the oral histories .
Other myths , Masse theorizes , hold similar clues .
Masse ’s biggest idea is that some 5,000 years ago , a 3 - mile - wide ball of rock and ice swung around the sun and smashed into the ocean off the coast of Madagascar .
The ensuing cataclysm sent a series of 600 - foot - high tsunamis crashing against the world ’s coastlines and injected plumes of superheated water vapor and aerosol particulates into the atmosphere .
Within hours , the infusion of heat and moisture blasted its way into jet streams and spawned superhurricanes that pummeled the other side of the planet .
For about a week , material ejected into the atmosphere plunged the world into darkness .
All told , up to 80 percent of the world ’s population may have perished , making it the single most lethal event in history .
Why , then , do n’t we know about it ?
Masse contends that we do .
Almost every culture has a legend about a great flood , and — with a little reading between the lines — many of them mention something like a comet on a collision course with Earth just before the disaster .
The Bible describes a deluge for 40 days and 40 nights that created a flood so great that Noah was stuck in his ark for two weeks until the water subsided .
In the Gilgamesh Epic , the hero of Mesopotamia saw a pillar of black smoke on the horizon before the sky went dark for a week .
Afterward , a cyclone pummeled the Fertile Crescent and caused a massive flood .
Myths recounted in indigenous South American cultures also tell of a great flood .
“ These stories are all exactly what you would expect from the survivors of a celestial impact , ” Masse says , leafing through 2,000 - year - old drawings by Chinese astronomers that show comets of all shapes and sizes .
“ When a comet rounds the sun , oftentimes its tail is still being blown forward by the solar winds so that it actually precedes it .
That is why so many descriptions of comets in mythology mention that they are wearing horns . ”
In India , he notes , a celestial fish described as “ bright as a moonbeam , ” with a horn on its head , warned of an epic flood that brought on a new age of man .
Among 175 flood myths , Masse found two of particular interest .
A Hindu myth describes an alignment of the five bright planets that has happened only once in the last 5,000 years , according to computer simulations , and a Chinese story mentions that the great flood occurred at the end of the reign of Empress Nu Wa.
Cross - checking historical records with astronomical data , Masse came up with a date for his event : May 10 , 2807 B.C .
On its own , the mythological evidence is weak , as even Masse recognizes .
“ Mythology can help us hypothesize about events that might have occurred , ” he says , “ but to prove the reality of them , we have to go beyond myths and search for physical evidence . ”
In 2004 , at a conference of geologists , astronomers , and archaeologists , Masse outlined his evidence for a world - ravaging impact in the middle of the Indian Ocean .
Ted Bryant , a geomorphologist at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales , Australia , was intrigued and enlisted the help of Dallas Abbott , an assistant professor at the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University .
In 2005 , they formed the Holocene Impact Working Group ( referring to the geological period covering the last 11,000 years ) to seek out the geological signatures of a megatsunami .
If a 600 - foot - high wave ravages a coastline , it should leave a lot of debris behind .
In the case of waves generated by asteroid impacts , the debris they leave in their wake is believed to form gigantic , wedge - shaped sandy structures — known as chevrons — that are sometimes packed with deep - oceanic microfossils dredged up by the tsunami .
When Abbott began searching satellite images on Google Earth , she saw dozens of chevrons along shorelines and inland in Africa and Asia .
The shape and size of these chevrons suggest that they might have been formed by waves emanating from the impact of a comet slamming into the deep ocean off Madagascar .
“ The chevrons in Madagascar associated with the crater were filled with melted microfossils from the bottom of the ocean .
There is no explanation for their presence other than a cosmic impact , ” she says .
“ People are going to have to start taking this theory a lot more seriously . ”
The next step is to perform carbon - 14 dating on the fossils to see if they are indeed 5,000 years old .
Meanwhile , Bryant contends that chevrons found ( pdf ) 4 miles inland from the shore of Madagascar were formed by a wave that traveled 25 miles along the coast , moving almost parallel to the shoreline .
“ Neither erosion nor any other terrestrial process could have caused these formations .
The biggest marine landslide ever recorded happened 7,200 years ago off the coast of Norway , and there was a tsunami , but it was a far cry from leaving deposits 200 meters above sea level , ” Bryant says .
Not everyone is convinced , to say the least .
“ I do n’t believe the evidence of a crater off Madagascar , and the impetus is on Abbott to prove it , ” says Jay Melosh , an impact expert at the University of Arizona and an outspoken critic of the theory .
To make a case for the impact , Melosh says , Abbott “ should be finding layers of glassy droplets and fused rock in sea-core samples , the sorts of things we find at all other similar impact sites . ”
On the other hand , a lot remains unknown about impacts .
As recently as 60 years ago , some geologists believed that the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona — now considered the prototypical impact scar — was caused by a volcanic explosion , and they regarded impacts as a minor if not inconsequential influence on Earth ’s history .
Just 25 years ago , Luis and Walter Alvarez raised eyebrows with their idea that an asteroid collision helped kill off the dinosaurs .
So Abbott continues to hunt for evidence that will clinch the idea that Noah ’s flood was yet another example of extraterrestrial meddling .
“ It is still up to us to prove it , but if we have unequivocal impact ejecta , ” she says , Melosh “ is going to have to eat his words . ”
Aug. 7 , 2007  --
In addition to his former role on NBC's " Law & Order " as tough - talking , gruff - but - lovable and fair District Attorney Arthur Branch , pending presidential candidate and former Sen .
Fred Thompson of Tennessee has benefited from a reputation for having served as an aggressive prosecutor while serving as minority counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee , officially known as the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities , chaired by Sen.
Sam Ervin , D - N.C. Thompson's own exploratory committee Web site , ImWithFred.com , even lauds this bit of his history .
" He gained national attention for leading the line of inquiry that revealed the audio - taping system in the White House Oval Office , " his official bio says ( LINK ) .
But the reality is far more complicated than conventional wisdom and campaign puffery would have it .
While some Democrats on the committee to this day profess respect and admiration for Thompson , he was seen as others as a " spy " for the Nixon White House -- an accusation buttressed , at least in part , by Thompson 's own writings , which confirm that he tipped off the Nixon White House about internal happenings on the committee .
Moreover , new transcripts from the Nixon White House tapes reveal that the Nixon administration regarded Thompson as a useful idiot -- " dumb as hell , " in President Nixon 's words , but " friendly . "
At one point , the White House counsel told Nixon that Thompson insisted he wanted to help the president more than his patron and boss on the committee , Sen. Howard Baker , R - Tenn , would let him .
Neither Thompson nor anyone from his potential campaign were available for comment .
The Question
It was July 16 , 1973 , and the committee was hearing from Alexander Butterfield , a deputy assistant to President Nixon .
" Mr. Butterfield , " Thompson asked , " are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president ? "
" I was aware of listening devices , " Butterfield said , " yes , sir . "
That question led to Nixon 's unraveling and ultimately his resignation , as various crimes and cover-ups were captured on those tapes -- tapes the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled the White House had to turn over to Congress .
As Thompson hagiography would have it , it was this question -- from a conservative but independent - minded 30 - year - old Tennessee prosecutor -- that led to the downfall of a corrupt president .
The Reality
Except it was n't so simple .
First of all , Thompson already knew the answer to the question , Butterfield having been interviewed by committee staff three days before , in closed - door testimony July 13 , 1973 .
" Somebody from the [ Lyndon ] Johnson administration told us that Johnson had a taping system , " said Terry Lenzner , then assistant chief counsel for the Democrats on the committee .
" So we as a matter of course we 're asking every witness , ' Do you have any information about that ? ' "
Thompson 's deputy , Donald Sanders , a Republican , asked the question of Butterfield July 13 , 1973 .
" What that reflects is we were sharing information , " said Lenzner .
" The overall tone [ on the committee ] was pretty bipartisan particularly compared to what 's going on now . "
When it came time for the public hearing , the Democrats ' chief counsel , Samuel Dash , wanted to ask the question , but Thompson 's patron -- Sen. Howard Baker , R - Tenn . -- insisted that a Republican gets to make the inquiry since it had been a Republican to make the discovery .
In his book " Chief Counsel : Inside the Ervin Committee -- the untold story of Watergate , " Dash wrote that he " personally resented it and felt cheated " for a Democrat not to have been permitted to ask the question in the nationally televised hearings .
But Dash felt given the circumstances he had " no choice but to let Fred Thompson develop the Butterfield material . "
Thompson did and a star was born .
The Tip - off
Dash 's decision was especially generous considering what Thompson was doing behind the scenes to help the Nixon White House prepare for the question .
In Thompson 's 1975 book , " At That Point in Time : The Inside Story of the Senate Watergate Committee " he writes that after learning of the existence of the tapes he " wanted to be sure that the White House was fully aware of what was to be disclosed so that it could take appropriate action .
... I believed it would be in everyone 's interest if the White House realized , before making any public statements , the probable position of both the majority and minority of the Watergate committee . "
Thompson wrote that " [ e ] ven though I had no authority to act for the committee , " he called Fred Buzhardt , the White House counsel on Watergate matters .
" ' Fred , ' Thompson recalls saying , ' the committee is aware of the fact that every conversation in the White House is on tape .
I know you realize the significance of this .
It 's not my place to give you advice , but I think that if I were you I 'd start making plans immediately to get those tapes together and get them up here as soon as possible . '
" There was a short pause .
Then Buzhardt said , ' Well , I think that is significant , if it is true .
We 'll get on it tomorrow . ' "
Scott Armstrong , the senior investigator for Democrats on the Watergate Committee , said he did n't know until Thompson 's book was published that Thompson had tipped off Buzhardt about Butterfield 's pending testimony , but it did n't surprise him , since Thompson had tipped off the White House about the explosive testimony of former Watergate conspirator John Dean .
A staffer on the committee , Armstrong said , provided him with a copy of a document Thompson had written to Republicans on the committee with Buzhardt 's instructions as to what to ask Dean about .
" This was after Thompson told them what Dean was going to testify to , " Armstrong told ABC News .
During his closed - door interview with Butterfield , Armstrong asked the White House counsel about the document , " and my assumption was over the weekend we were going to see the resignation of Fred Thompson , since he was subverting the Watergate Committee . "
" There was nothing more secret than what Dean was going to testify to , " Armstrong said .
" Ervin said , ' Do n't share anything with Baker and Thompson , because they 're not trustworthy . "
But instead , Armstrong said , " Ervin very generously gave Baker the nod to go ahead and do the Butterfield question .
And rather than ending Thompson 's career for all time , it seems to be something Thompson now feels he can brag about . "
But in reality , Armstrong insisted Thompson " was a spy for Richard Nixon on the Watergate Committee . "
But Lenzner is more charitable , saying Democrats would have likely done the same thing for a Democratic president had the circumstances been the same .
" If it was an attempt to subvert the inquiry or to affect people 's testimony , obviously that would have been wrong , " he said .
But he does not think that 's what Thompson was doing , and he is reassured by Thompson 's account that he told Buzhardt to " get those tapes together and get them up here as soon as possible . "
" If that 's in fact what was said , that 's a pretty positive thing for Fred to have done , " Lenzner said .
" He 's basically saying , ' We 'll want them and you should produce them . '
I 'm not troubled by anything I knew then " about Thompson 's conduct , " and I 'm not troubled by anything I heard today . "
Thompson admitted in " At That Point in Time " that he did n't think the tapes would hurt Nixon .
After learning of the tapes from Sanders , Thompson began subscribing to the theory that " Butterfield had been sent to us as part of a strategy :
The president was orchestrating the whole affair and had intended that the tapes be discovered .
Then he would produce the tapes , or perhaps play them publicly ; there would be nothing incriminating , and [ former White House counsel ]
John Dean 's testimony would be utterly discredited .
It was some time before my theory -- and I was not alone in holding it -- proved totally wrong .
" In retrospect it is apparent that I was subconsciously looking for a way to justify my faith in the leader of my country and my party , " Thompson wrote , " a man who was undergoing a violent attack from the news media , which I thought had never given him fair treatment in the past .
I was looking for a reason to believe that Richard M. Nixon , President of the United States , was not a crook . "
Said Lenzner after those passages were read to him : " I find that all very understandable .
If the shoe had been on the other foot we would have felt many of the same things . "
' He is n't very smart , is he ? '
Lenzner speaks highly of Thompson 's intelligence .
But the Nixon White House had long been suspicious of Thompson -- because they thought ill of his intellect , at least according to transcripts of Nixon 's White House tapes from " Abuse of Power : The New Nixon Tapes , " by Stanley Kutler .
On May 14 , 1973 , then White House chief of staff Alexander Haig tells President Nixon that he pulled then - Acting White House Counsel Leonard Garment off a phone call with Thompson .
" Oh shit , " Nixon said of Thompson , fearing he would be out - skilled by Democrats on the committee .
" He 's dumb as hell . "
Upon hearing Baker had chosen Thompson to be minority counsel in February , Nixon said , " Oh shit , that kid… They are going to lose them all . "
" Well , we 're stuck with him , " replied H.R. Haldeman , the White House chief of staff who would resign on April 30 .
Later that month , in a conversation with Nixon , Baker assured the president that Thompson was " tough .
He 's six feet five inches .
He 's a big mean fella . "
" Smart ? " asked Nixon .
" He 's terribly smart , " Baker replied .
But Nixon was not convinced .
On March 16 , 1973 , he told Dean that " Dash is too smart for that kid , " meaning Thompson , then 30 years old .
On June 6 , 1973 , Buzhardt -- the White House lawyer Thompson later tipped off about Butterfield 's pending testimony about the tapes -- told Nixon that " we 've got pretty good rapport with Fred Thompson . "
" He is n't very smart , is he ? "
Nixon asked .
" He squeezed Gurney , " Buzhardt said , referring to Sen. Edward Gurney , R - Fla .
" Not extremely so , but --"
" But he 's friendly , " Nixon said .
" But he 's friendly , " Buzhardt agreed .
" Good , " said Nixon .
" We 're going to work with him over the weekend , " Buzhardt said .
" We are hoping , though , to work with Thompson and prepare him if Dean does appear next week , to do a very thorough cross-examination . "
On June 11 , 1973 , Buzhardt told Nixon that the preparation had gone well .
" I found , uh , uh , Thompson most cooperative , feeling more Republican every day , " Buzhardt said .
" Really ? " asked Nixon .
" So he tells me , " Buzhardt said , calling Thompson " perfectly prepared to assist in really doing a cross-examination . "
He called him " far more cooperative really than I expected him to be .
He 's willing to go , you know , pretty much the distance now .
And he said he realized his responsibility was going to have be as a Republican increasingly . "
" He realizes that Ervin , et al. , and Dash are being totally political , does he ? "
" Right , " said Buzhardt , who then said that Thompson said he wanted to more aggressively defend the president but was being restrained by Baker .
" [ H ]e says Baker 's aware of it " -- how " political " things were getting -- " but he was quite candid with us ; he thinks Baker will move much more slowly than he will let Thompson move . "
" Right , " said Nixon .
A few days after that conversation , Thompson 's public question about Nixon 's tapes -- regardless of his motivation -- helped bring about the end of the Nixon presidency , inadvertently or not .
" It 's one of life 's ironies that history gets twisted to show the vulgar is the noble , " said Armstrong .
International Terrorism Does Not Exist
By General Leonid Ivashov , former Chief of Russian Military Staff
As the current international situation shows , terrorism emerges where contradictions aggravate , where there is a change of social relations or a change of regime , where there is political , economic or social instability , where there is moral decadence , where cynicism and nihilism triumph , where vice is legalized and where crime spreads .
It is globalization what creates the conditions for the emergence of these extremely dangerous phenomena .
It is in this context that the new world geo-strategic map is being designed , that the resources of the planet are being re-distributed , that borders are disappearing , that international law is being torn into pieces , that cultural identities are being erased , and that spiritual life becomes impoverished .
The analysis of the essence of the globalization process , the military and political doctrines of the United States and other countries , shows that terrorism contributes to a world dominance and the submissiveness of states to a global oligarchy .
This means that terrorism is not something independent of world politics but simply an instrument , a means to install a unipolar world with a sole world headquarters , a pretext to erase national borders and to establish the rule of a new world elite .
It is precisely this elite that constitutes the key element of world terrorism , its ideologist and its “ godfather ” .
The main target of the world elite is the historical , cultural , traditional and natural reality ; the existing system of relations among states ; the world national and state order of human civilization and national identity .
In this context , if we analyze what happened on September 11 , 2001 , in the United States , we can arrive at the following conclusions :
1 . The organizers of those attacks were the political and business circles interested in destabilizing the world order and who had the means necessary to finance the operation .
The political conception of this action matured in the face of emerging tensions in the administration of financial and other types of resources .
We have to look for the reasons of the attacks in the coincidence of interests of Big Capital at global and transnational levels , in the circles that were not satisfied with the rhythm of the globalization process or its direction .
Unlike traditional wars , whose conception is determined by generals and politicians , the oligarchs and politicians were the ones who did it this time .
2 . Only secret services and their current chiefs , or those retired but still with influence inside the state organizations , have the ability to plan , organize and conduct an operation of such magnitude .
Generally , secret services create , finance and control extremist organizations .
Without the support of secret services , these organizations cannot exist , let alone carry out operations of such magnitude inside countries so well protected .
Planning and carrying out an operation on this scale is extremely complex .
3. Osama bin Laden and “ Al Qaeda ” cannot be the organizers nor the performers of the September 11 attacks .
They do not have the necessary organization , resources or leaders .
Thus , a team of professionals had to be created , and the Arab kamikazes are just extras to mask the operation .
The September 11 operation modified the course of events in the world in the direction chosen by transnational mafias and international oligarchs ; that is , those who hope to control the planet ’s natural resources , the world information network and financial flows .
This operation also favored the US economic and political elite that also seeks world dominance .
The use of the term “ international terrorism ” has the following goals :
1 . Hiding the real objectives of the forces deployed all over the world in the struggle for dominance and control ;
2. Creating a public demand for a struggle with undefined goals against an invisible enemy ;
3 . Destroying basic international norms and changing concepts such as : aggression , state terror , dictatorship or movement of national liberation ;
4 . Depriving peoples of their legitimate right to resist aggression and to reject the work of foreign intelligence services ;
5 . Establishing the principle of renunciation to national interests , transforming objectives in the military field by giving priority to the war on terror , violating the logic of military alliances to the detriment of a joint defense and to favor the anti-terrorist coalition ;
6 . Solving economic problems through a tough military rule using the war on terror as a pretext .
In order to fight in an efficient way against international terrorism it is necessary to take the following steps :
1 . To confirm before the UN General Assembly the principles of the UN Charter and international law as principles that all states are obliged to respect ; 2 . To create a geo-strategic organization ( perhaps inspired in the Cooperation Organization of Shanghai comprised of Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan ) with a set of values different to that of the Atlantists ; to design a strategy of development of states , a system of international security , another financial and economic model ( which would mean that the world would again rest on two pillars ) ; 3 . To associate ( under the United Nations ) the scientific elites in the design and promotion of the philosophical concepts of the Human Being of the 21st Century .
4 . To organize the interaction of all religious denominations in the world , on behalf of the stability of humanity ’s development , security and mutual support .
This article was written ( January 22 , 2006 ) as a follow - up to the Axis For Peace Conference , Brussels , 2005
Who is General Ivashov ?
General Leonid Ivashov is the vice - president of the Russian Academy on geopolitical affairs .
He was the chief of the department for General affairs in the Soviet Union ’s ministry of Defense , secretary of the Council of defense ministers of the Community of independant states ( CIS ) , chief of the Military cooperation department at the Russian federation ’s Ministry of defense .
General Leonid Ivashov was the Chief of Staff of the Russian armed forces when the September 11 , 2001 , attacks took place .
Ivashov , who lived the events from the inside , offers an analysis which is very different from that of his American colleagues .
As he did during the Axis for Peace 2005 conference , General Ivashov now explains that international terrorism does not exist and that the September 11 attacks were the result of a set - up .
What we are seeing is a manipulation by the big powers ; this terrorism would not exist without them .
He affirms that , instead of faking a “ world war on terror ” , the best way to reduce that kind of attack is through respect for international law and peaceful cooperation among countries and their citizens .
At today 's Congressional hearing about the new rates for online radio that would essentially destroy it ( as readers of this blog already know ) , SoundExchange , which was scheduled to receive the new royalty payments on Monday morning ( since the enforcement date falls on a Sunday ) , made a startling statement .
The SoundExchange executive [ Jon Simson , executive director ] promised said – in front of Congress – that SoundExchange will not enforce the new royalty rates on Monday .
Webcasters will stay online , as new rates are hammered out .
I just spoke with Pandora founder Tim Westergren , who expressed relief that Pandora would n't have to shut down on Sunday in response to the new rates .
He said , " It was getting pretty close .
I always had underlying optimism that sanity was going to prevail , but I was beginning to wonder . "
He said everyone who called their Congress person about this should feel that they had an effect on the process : " This is a direct result of lobbying pressure , so if anyone thinks their call did n't matter , it did .
That 's why this is happening . "
The flyer DiMA distributed to Congress today probably helped a bit too , but overall , it appears Congress intervened due to pressure from web radio listeners .
Funnily enough , Westergren told me this mere hours after a representative of SoundExchange said
that the new rates are " etched in stone . "
Evidently not .
\ — –
Update : Another source – close to the situationalthough not inside today 's closed - door hearing – confirmed thefollowing : Pandora was there ; " progress was made " ; the minimum fees areindeed off the table ; and SoundExchange and the webcasters that werepart of the Copyright Royalty Board hearings are going to have anotherchat about the rates .
However , the source said the big question right now is whetherwebcasters not part of the CRB hearing might still have to pay therates set by the board , minus the minimum fees .
Basically , this news qualifies as a reprieve , but internet radiowo n't be truly saved until negotiations result in a workable royaltyrate .
Another Update : This story has been confirmed by Kurt Hanson of RAIN .
Final Update : Overnight , this blog post was mistakenly reverted back to a very early title , which used the phrase " Internet Radio Saved . "
What happened in Washington yesterday was more of a reprieve than a total relief , since royalty rate negotiations continue .
That said , webcasters do n't need to pay the new rates on Monday , and therefore will not shut down , the minimum per-station fee is off the table , and the way is paved for more workable rates to be set .
For the full story , read this article .
\ — –
Westergren had more to say , lending insight into a process that was largely opaque to non-participants .
Apparently , theper - channel minimum fees mandated by the Copyright Royalty Board were never taken very seriously by those involved .
They 'venow been taken off the table completely , saving Pandora , Live365 , and othermulticasters from their most imminent threat .
Instead , per-station minimums will be capped at $ 50,000 per year .
" No one thought those per station fees were remotelyrational .
It only makes sense that they 're being taken off the table . "
Asfor the Copyright Royalty Board ?
They 're entirely cut out of theprocess , having set the rates and then refused a rehearing .
Going forward without the royalties being collected , SoundExchange and webcasters will negotiate a new royalty rate with Congress looking over their shoulder – " and last but not least , thepublic looking over Congress 's shoulder . "
Alternatively , Congress now has time to consider the Internet Radio Equality
Act , which would set webcaster royalties at 7.5 percent of revenue and allow them to continue operating pretty much as they have been .
Either way , this is a big win for webcasters and their listeners .
Again , this is a reprieve , and internetradio can't be considered saved until new rates are set that everyonecan live with .
Georgia 's Drought Solution : Pray for Rain Posted by wizeGurl ( 9710 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Environment ]
As global climate change threatens to bring flooding to some areas , and drought to others , the southeastern U.S. is in the grip of the worst drought in decades .
One small town in Tennesse has completely run out of water .
Water use restrictions in Alabama and Georgia aim to conserve the dwindling reservoir supplies until the rains come at last .
What 's Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue 's solution ?
Address global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
Task America scientists to study changing rainfall patterns , to develop new water distribution schemes that will work when the weather takes on new patterns ?
Nope .
Pray .
It 's the only solution that requires no sacrifice whatsoever .
And since it will , eventually , rain again , it 's sure to work , though maybe not until the states go thirsty .
Why not just conjure up a rain dance ?
It would surely have the same effectiveness .
Or maybe a good dowser could locate hidden springs and save the day .
And hey , I 'm sure there are a few breatharians around here somewhere who lived solely on light , the power of prayer , and the scent of flowers .
Maybe we could get them to teach us how it 's done .
Details .
I will pray with you .......
Posted by Bj Prince on 2007-11-12 08:06:42 Please Please , Pray and I will do my part .
God WILL answer , we Need more men like you ........
Thank you for your leadership .
An Alabama Christian .
With God we can do all things .
Yes , even rain .
God did it before , He will do it again .
God Bless Sonny Perdue .
Posted by frank freeman on 2007 - 11 - 12 15:15:26 praying for rain always works if you get the timing right .
comedians are masters of timing .
politicians are clowns , not comedians , so they are unlikely to get the timing right .
next time sonny is n't feeling well , i hope he calls a pastor and not a physician .
especially if he has something fatal .
Posted by George Wilkerson on 2007- 11-13 04:12:32 Georgia needs a more serious governor .
Nice ...
Posted by ATLgirl on 2007 - 11-13 22:48:23
How on earth do you propose Governor Perdue cut greenhouse gases in time to bring us rain when we need it ?
And it 's not like it's all of Georgia 's fault that people in LA are ruining the environment with all of their polution .
So yeah , that sounds like a GREAT plan ....
I am not a religious person , but I figure it 's worth a try since there 's not much else we can do at this point .
Making fun of it sure wo n't do any good .
Have a little faith ...
Posted by Stanley on 2007 - 11- 17 14:23:36
There is no proof that God exists .
Everyone who believes that God exists learned it from someone else - a fallible human .
If God exists ,
He can not be expected to be more interested in water in Georgia than in the state of the entire universe - of which Georgia is a very tiny part .
If God exists ,
He can not be expected to be more interested in humans than in the condition of every other organism - microbe , insect and virus included .
In short , Gov Perdue is , at best , a fool , at worst , a charlatan .
Those who are comforted by his wasted effort should worry more about doing something meaningful about the drought .
Posted by sharyn on 2007 - 11 - 21 00:44:10 why hate on Christians praying for agreeably good things in a public place ?
will this somehow bring about the end of the world ?
REAL Christians only have two rules : love God and love people .
even though non-Christians can down us / judge us / hate us , all we can do is love you .
Does that makes Christians scary ?
What kind of person hates people that love them ?
Why bother those who get peace , security , and comfort from their faith ?

This sounds like a prime candidate for a digital clean - up !
Many commenters remark that his performance is poor , but forget to listen to the instruments ( the woodwind , for instance ) , and notice that they " perform " poorly as well .
So the quality we hear is most certainly due to serious limits in recording technology .
So therefore , it would be very interesting to hear a cleaned - up version , so that we may get to know what the castrati once ACTUALLY sounded like .

As a vocal coach and a choir director , I am not impressed .
I do not like his interpretation at all .
Yes , he has a talent ( boy , he sure can sing high notes ) , but perhaps by 1904 he was past his prime .
Shaky voice with too many ornamentations -- this really lacked appeal to me .
This piece really calls for legato singing for those long , beautiful phrases .
He did nothing of the sort .
It was choppy .

Subject : Public Domain IANAL , but I 'm pretty confident that it 's completely public domain .
The music was composed in 1856 , so it 's public domain .
The performance in 1904 is also old enough to be public domain .
A pretty good rule of thumb is that wax cylinder recordings are in the public domain , but as of 2012 no more modern recordings ( vinyl discs and later media ) .

It is a piece that will always evoke very deep reflections in anyone who is well acquainted with the travails of Mary and the exemplary life she lived as a mother .
I also suspect that it means nothing to most people , but about Alessandro , who was singing this piece at age 46 , I doubt if the sacrifice he was made to undergo justifies the performance I just listened to .
The poor recording can be quite excused , but I think a female voice would have been more listenable .

I do n't think the music , nor the singing were very good .
Now , perhaps the person was n't at the peak of his career , and he was perhaps an admirable castrati ... but this recording ( his singing ) and the arrangement is just not good .
I do have to admit that there was a something erie sounding to the vocal intonation .
One could definitely tell that this was a male voice too .
Interesting enough , I was under the impression that it would sound more female ... perhaps I need to hear the other recordings .
Yes and to the person who claims that a male loses 70 % of sexual intensity in circumcision , that 's total bullshit ..
Do your homework .
Men who have not had circumcision are more prone to problems in the bedroom then men without it .
Any woman whose had experience with both will tell you the men who are uncircumcised are more difficult .
Now , perhaps you are an exception but the idea that you can compare castration to circumcision and not female castration just shows what a sexist ass you are .

Subject : Some bad , some good
Anyone who gives this song a poor rating for the sole reason of the singer being a male who was castrated , should have their review thrown out for shear stupidities sake .
Even if he sang the most beautiful piece ever recorded with modern technology , they would give it a one star rating due to being castrated .
They are only objecting to the social norms of over 150 years ago , and even then it was falling out of favor .
The changing social norm where women in the 19th century were given a place in society instead of being silent helped stop young boys from being castrated .
The changing social norms is one reason Castrati fell out of favor .
If anyone in a strong choral group knows , men can , and do , out sing women in volume on a one - to - one basis .
This is the other reason ( I believe ) why Castrati were popular then .
One Castrato could be heard in a greater range than one femaile could .
People today do n't go en mass to listen to large groups as compared to those who sing solos or a small group where you can often tell the difference in parts .
With the technology available with microphones , both men and women can sound equally loud , when their is a difference without .
This is not the same song , but this following male child singer has yet to appear to have hit puberty in the following piece : .
Now , why I rated the song Ave Maria here three star is in part due to the fact is it such a poor quality recording .
I also dislike the way he heavily uses grace notes .
There is a reason he performed at the funeral for the Italian King when he was assassinated in 1900 .
He was one of the top singers in 1900 .
While I dislike his style , I can recognize he had talent .

Reviewer : MBeggs - - September 17 , 2008
Subject : Some Clarification
I think some serious clarification as to the history of Castrati is in order since many assertions have been made about this recording and its singer that simply are not true .
First of all , very few of the Castrati of history had any say in the matter of their castration .
With the exception of a few ( maybe two or three ) of the great castrati , most notably among them Cafarelli ( a contemporary of the better known Farinelli ) , who insisted on his own castration , the great majority of castrati became castrati without any wanting to do so .
It was , as with so many things , largely a case of money .
Poor families would have a son castrated in the hope that he would become a good enough castrato to earn the family money .
The chances of this happening were somewhere near 1/50 or 1/100 .
The chances of his becoming a Farinelli or Cafarelli were closer to 1/1000 or 1/10000 .
They went off to the catholic church ( which disapproved of castration , but was also the beneficiary of the talent , as they could maintain the rule that women stay " Silent in Church " while still having soprano voices that lasted a long time .
Only the very best of the castrati could become opera singers , where they could become very wealthy and famous .
The main thing that distinguished a castrato voice from a female soprano , mezzo , alto or contralto ( castrato voices were not all soprano , Senesino was a Contralto ) was that the larynx of the castrato was that of a boy , but the lungs of a castrato were those of a man .
They had incredible power and control over their voices , and obviously an ethereal timbre that cannot be replicated .
Now on to Moreschi .
By 1820 , the castrati were out of fashion in opera and the process of castration was ( rightly ) seen as repulsive and inhumane .
Moreschi , who began to sing fifty years after the end of the era of the castrati , was so far removed from the tradition ( even when he was young , he was one of probably less than 100 castrati singing in the world ) , that he cannot possibly represent the art that a Farinelli or Senesino brought to his singing .
He also sang only church music , and thus sang with little or no ornamentation .
He represents a rather average castrato , who was equipped with a fine voice , but was by no stretch of the imagination a great singer .
His place in history is as the castrato who was recorded .
By 1921 , the last castrato singing in the Sistine Chapel choir was replaced , and the castrati were no more .
Castrati were a fact of life in spiritual and operatic music from 1600 to 1820 .
All castrati , regardless of talent , were mutilated in order to be given their voice , and almost none of them wished it to be so .
It is nice to have Moreschi 's recordings , but the best way to know the kind of singers the great castrati were is to study the music that was written for them .
If you want to hear a hint of what they would have sounded like , listen to countertenor David Daniels .
Much of the information I have given is presented in Richard Somerset - Ward 's book Angels and Monsters .
I would suggest reading it if you are seriously interested in Opera and soprano roles .

The only extant recording of a castrati singer .
And as a result , it is a precious historical and cultural artifact .
In today 's world , the only way one could become a castrati singer would be 1 ) to start as an excellent child singer , 2 ) to not have even * started * puberty by the time he reaches 18 , 3 ) to make a personal decision as an adult to be a castrati , and 4 ) to find a surgeon willing to perform the surgery before puberty begins .
Very unlikely indeed .
If one examines music written specifically for castrati singers , one finds the music to be exceptionally difficult for even the most skilled of today 's singers .
This would indicate that the physiology of the castrati lent itself to a relatively easy execution of these passages .
Perhaps those 4 criteria will come to pass someday , though it no doubt will be absolutely discouraged .
Until then , to understand the castrati is to study the music and listen to the one extant recording .

This is for the people claiming Moreschi has bad singing technique .
" It should also be mentioned that Moreschi 's vocal technique can grate upon modern ears ; many of his seemingly imperfect vocal attacks are in fact grace notes , launched from as much as a tenth below the note up to the note itself .
Furthermore , the dated aesthetic of Moreschi 's singing , which involved extreme passion in the singing and a perpetual type of sob , often sounds bizarre to the modern listener and can be misinterpreted as technical weakness or an aging voice . "

So before you random people start to talk bad about how horrific it must have been , or how haunting his voice is do some decent research to put the CONTENT in CONTEXT .
Castration is barbaric ?
I do agree with that but at the same time they did live the life of Rock Stars , seeing as how women adored them and castrato singers were in HIGH demand at that time seeing as there were hunderds of churches and only so many castrato singers .

I do n't know if it 's the same with the voice in the aging time line , but something that affects aging to THAT extent must have some effect on the voice .
Point being , it might have been way past his prime .

While I know nothing of music ...
I do know that the first time I stumbled upon this recording , I interrupted it not even 30 seconds into it and ran off to talk to my family about anything - other - than this .
It took me an hour or so to recover from the initial shock and to then force my brother to listen to it with me .
I did n't touch it again until today , so it has been at least three months .
My nonexistant balls ( I am female ) still hurt from the knowledge that this was sung by a man , fully grown , whose testes were mutilated for the sake of art .
Yet , as I read Kelly Greene 's review , I thought of a friend of mine who told me it took months ( a few years ? ) of practice and coughing up blood for his voice to reach the rather unpleasant ( to me ) lower ranges that Rammstein favors .
As much as I 'm appalled ( as many were ) that this man suffered through castration to reach a voice which nearly gave me nightmares -- I had to stay up long past my bedtime and talk to friends to attempt and forget this haunting voice -- singers and artists of today still do horrible things to their body .
That said , I did some research as to the situation of the castrati during the past three months and while I 'm still rather traumatized by it , I can see and perhaps understand -- but not agree -- a bit why the Church turned a blind eye to this .
I can even imagine that some ambitious children -- not just the parents ... human nature does n't limit things such as stardom lust to adults after all -- might 've agreed to undergo castration .
Overall , yes , the quality of the recording is bad for our times but it was a breakthrough for them .
The man 's voice ...
I can't say anything about it except that it troubles me a lot .
Piano ?
I know even less about that .

Mystique certainly plays a role .
But IF it 's true , what physiological difference would account for it ?
Again , women , like castrati , do not undergo the testosterone - induced thickening of the vocal cords .
So what PHYSICALLY would account for the supposed differences ?
Could it be that the continued growth of castrati , far past when women cease to grow , could give them a deeper lung capacity that changes the ' timbre ' ?

Many did ; castration - with the hope of a lifelong career singing in church - was a hit - and - miss " art / science " ; the emasculation of most " victims " was , indeed , wasted , as they had neither talent nor potential .
As for those who bemoan the castrations - it's no more barbaric than the still far - too - common American practice of butchering male children ( circumcision ) and thereby depriving them of some 70 % of sexual - pleasure nerve - endings .
Any American mother ( or m - to - be ) , or any American medico who objects to castration must , on principle , also object to their nation 's barbarism re male circumcision .
And there 's no way the timbre of a castrato - or a modern , intact , male soprano for that matter - can be compared with the timbre of a female voice ; the two are apples and bananas .
If we had castrati today we'd have ( a ) beautiful music and ( b ) less overpopulation of the planet .

I found your wallet .
Saturday night at Lush you came on to me .
I turned you down politely but you had to get a little nasty and huff off .
That was n’t enough for you though , because then you took it a step further and sexually and verbally assaulted me by the bathrooms 20 minutes later .
In your haste to depart after I started to yell , you dropped your wallet out of your coat pocket .
Bummer .
I ’m so sorry to report that your wallet inadvertently landed in the bay , somewhere along the Bay Bridge , I think .
Oh yeah , and I ’m afraid that condom that expired in 1999 , your credit cards , ATM , and social security card ( you really should n’t carry that around , you know ) accidentally fell onto the street somewhere on Polk Street .
Oops .
( What else do you expect from a " stupid bitch " like me who has the audacity to reject you ? )
Since your wallet is now in the bay , I did n’t know where to send the money .
I tried the phone book under " Funny - looking - Rapist - With - Foul - Breath " ” and “ Short - Dude - With - Chip - On - Shoulder ” and even " Slightly - Retarded - Looking - Guy - With - Bad - Toupee ” but , alas , there were no listings .
Since you spent part of the night telling me stories that emphasized how sensitive and caring you are , I figured you ’d be happy to know that I donated the rather large sum of cash to a rape crisis center .
Hopefully the next rape you are involved in will be your own .
In prison .
Sincerely , ~ The " Stupid Bitch " who rejected you .

Edit :
I seems like I ’ve done a bad job selecting words for my headline .
Some people think that I am complaining because I “ just ” got $ 4000 .
I ’m not complaining .
It ’s a not - so - successful formulation to say that this happened recently .
Or like one of the commenters over at Reddit said :
“ I assume that “ just ” refers to time .
Meaning they only now , a short while ago , had to pay $ 4000 . ”
About a year ago I was surprised when I saw an image of my son in an ad for a shop called “ Vinderen Elektriske ” , selling electronics .
I immediately contacted the editor of the magazine in question , “ Vinderen Magasinet ” .
She directed me to the advertiser and the designer behind the ad .
I contacted the designer .
She had found the image “ on the internet ” and reacted like I was rude and angry without any reason when I told her that she could n’t use the image without my permission .
I was obviously talking to a professional designer with absolutely no knowledge of intellectual property laws .
The use of my image is a very clear violation of several paragraphs in those laws .
Both because I own the rights to the image and because they need permission from the easily recognizable person in the image .
So I called the manager of the shop responsible for the ad .
He was not very friendly either and simply directed me to their lawyer .
Probably in hope of me simply forgetting about it because I did n’t want to fight their lawyer .
Unfortunately for them this simply pissed me off .
Seriously .
I am not too difficult when it comes to people wanting to use my images .
An apology and a suggestion for some kind of compensation would have been okay .
But now I just went from a minor irritation to pure anger .
Fortunately I am pretty well connected and a couple of emails later I am in contact with the utterly talented Mr. Halvor Manshaus .
You know , Jon Lech Johansen aka DVD - Jon ’s lawyer .
A lawyer you do n’t want on your neck when discussing digital rights .
But he ’s not cheap .
Not even after a couple of beer and a very interesting discussion about technology and new media …
And with this incident I do n’t know if I ’ll get any kind of economic compensation in the end , so I have to put aside thousands of dollars and prepare to cover the expenses if I lose .
Most people would probably just give up .
That ’s why this story is important .
Some weeks later I am fortunate enough to meet Mr. Jon Bing at a conference where we both where speaking .
Jon Bing is a Norwegian writer and law professor at the Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law .
I tell him about the case .
He tells me that the economic compensations people get in cases like these very often are pretty low .
But he also says that the case is somewhat important and that I should go through with it to state an example .
I should do my duty .
Okay .
This would cost me time and money , but I ’m pissed , the professor tells me I should do it and Halvor Manshaus is at my service .
I instruct Mr. Manshaus to go on and send a proposal to the lawyer that Vinderen Elektriske was using .
He proposes a compensation of about $ 8000 and make it clear that they have violated Norwegian law of intellectual property .
He also asks for documentation on exactly where they used the image .
After a while they reply that this is out of proportions and that they wo n’t pay more than something like $ 1000 , - No apology and no documentation on the usage .
I do n’t accept this .
Mr. Manshaus sends another letter .
This time with even more references to Norwegian law and a statement about the fact that I am willing to go on and charge them for violation of intellectual property law .
They fail to answer on time and we need to send a reminder with yet another letter .
In the next letter they propose something close to $ 4000 , - as long as I prove that it ’s my son in the image ( ! )
That ’s not very difficult to prove .
Because I do n’t have the time and money to push this further I accept the $ 4000 , - It ’s enough to cover my expenses and leave some dollars that I will put away for my son .
Still , Vinderen Elektriske never gave me proper documentation on where they used the image .
They never gave me any form of apology .
But at least it states an example .
And I hope the designer now have learned that she ca n’t just use whatever she finds through Google Images and I hope Vinderen Elektriske are more careful the next time they put together an ad .
And there is another important lesson to be learned here .
The one about communication and marketing .
In about 20 seconds the owner of Vinderen Elektriske could have avoided :
– $ 4000 , - in compensation to me
– Expenses for his own lawyer
– Bad publicity
How ?
Instead of answering
“ We found the image on the internet .
Talk to our lawyer ”
He could have said something like
“ Oh . I ’m so sorry .
Our designer must have made a mistake .
We really liked your image .
How can we fix this ?
Of course you should have some kind of compensation .
Maybe you would give our shop a visit and pick a Nintendo Wii and some games for your son ? ”
Unfortunately they selected the other option .
Pissing me off .
Making sure I now hate really dislike Vinderen Elektriske .
Making sure my family , most of my readers and huge amounts of people around the different forums where this story has been shared also hate dislike them .

Edit :
Did a couple of edits that I have moved down into the comments .
Software developers do have a proclivity for puzzles .
Perhaps that 's why books like To Mock a Mockingbird exist .
It 's a collection of logic puzzles which is considered an introduction to lambda calculus , one of the core concepts of Lisp .
Such puzzle questions are de rigueur for many programming interviews , though they 're often abused .
There is a downside to thinking of programming languages as solutions to arbitrarily difficult abstract mathematical puzzles .
That 's probably why Lisp has a rich reputation for being powerful but simultaneously dense and impenetrable .
I prefer to think of programming languages as utilitarian tools for real world problems .
They let me accomplish pragmatic ( and often prosaic ) goals .
PHP is about as unsexy a language as you 'll ever find , but does that matter when it's the technology driving the current Boardwalk and Park Place of the web world ?
I 'm not a fan of puzzle questions in interviews ; I 'd rather have potential developers give me a presentation or write a reasonably useful program in the real development environment they 'll be using on the job .
Solve all the puzzles you want , but the only one we 're getting paid to solve is the customer 's problem .
That said , many fundamental computer science concepts can be summarized well in puzzle form , which aids tremendously in teaching and learning these key concepts .
Here 's a quick list of the classic computer science puzzles that I remember from my university days :
Dining Philosophers
Concurrency and Deadlocks
Five philosophers sit around a circular table .
In front of each philosopher is a large plate of rice .
The philosophers alternate their time between eating and thinking .
There is one chopstick between each philosopher , to their immediate right and left .
In order to eat , a given philosopher needs to use both chopsticks .
How can you ensure all the philosophers can eat reliably without starving to death ?
Travelling Salesman
P=NP
A salesperson has a route of cities that make up his or her beat .
What 's the most efficient sales route that visits each city exactly once , and then returns to the home city ?
Eight Queens
Algorithm Design
Given eight queens on a standard 8 x 8 chessboard , how many unique positions -- exclusive of rotations and mirror images -- can those eight queens occupy without attacking each other ?
Two Generals
Communication Protocols
Two armies , each led by a general , are preparing to attack a city .
The armies are encamped outside the city on two mountains separated by a large valley .
In order to capture the city , the generals must attack at exactly the same time .
The only way for the generals to communicate is by sending messengers through the valley .
Unfortunately , the valley is occupied by the city 's defenders , so there 's a chance any given messenger will be captured .
Each general has no way of knowing if their messenger arrived .
How do the generals coordinate their attack ?
Towers of Hanoi
Recursion
You have a stack of discs , from largest to smallest , that slide on to the first peg of a three peg board .
Your goal is to move the entire stack of discs from the first peg to the third peg .
However , you can only move the topmost disc of any peg , and smaller discs must always be placed on larger discs .
How many moves will it take ?
I consider this the " greatest hits " of classic computer science puzzles .
But I 'm sure I 've forgotten a few .
Are there any other puzzles I 've missed that express fundamental computer science concepts , the type that would be taught in a typical undergraduate computer science course ?

WHO KNEW ?….
A “ former senior intelligence official with direct knowledge of the episode ” tells the New York Times that lawyers within the clandestine branch of the CIA approved the destruction of those videotaped interrogations in 2005 :
The former intelligence official acknowledged that there had been nearly two years of debate among government agencies about what to do with the tapes , and that lawyers within the White House and the Justice Department had in 2003 advised against a plan to destroy them .
….
In describing the decision to destroy the tapes , current and former officials said John A. Rizzo , the agency ’s top lawyer at the time , was not asked for final approval before the tapes were destroyed , although Mr. Rizzo had been involved in discussions for two years about the tapes .
…. ” Although unlikely , it is conceivable that once a C.I.A. officer got the answer he wanted from a D.O. lawyer , he acted on that advice , ” said John Radsan , who worked as a C.I.A. lawyer between 2002 and 2004 and is now a professor at William Mitchell College of Law in Minnesota … .
Mr. Radsan added , “ I ’d be surprised that even the chief D.O. lawyer made a decision of that magnitude without bringing the General Counsel ’s front office into the loop . ”
Let me get this straight .
The White House had been in the loop for two years .
The CIA had received letters from both the Justice Department and congressional leaders arguing that the tapes should n’t be destroyed .
The CIA ’s top lawyer had been involved for the entire time .
And yet we ’re supposed to believe that , in 2005 , a mid-ranking agency lawyer suddenly decided the tapes could be destroyed and the head of the clandestine branch then gave the order to do so without anyone else being involved ?
Really ?
Does anyone actually believe this story ?
This year ’s death penalty bombshells  a de facto national moratorium , a state abolition and the smallest number of executions in more than a decade  have masked what may be the most significant and lasting development .
For the first time in the modern history of the death penalty , more than 60 percent of all American executions took place in Texas .
Over the past three decades , the proportion of executions nationwide performed in Texas has held relatively steady , averaging 37 percent .
Only once before , in 1986 , has the state accounted for even a slight majority of the executions , and that was in a year with 18 executions nationwide .
But enthusiasm for executions outside of Texas has dropped sharply .
Of the 42 executions in the last year , 26 were in Texas .
The remaining 16 were spread across nine other states , none of which executed more than three people .
Many legal experts say the trend will probably continue .
Indeed , said David R. Dow , a law professor at the University of Houston who has represented death - row inmates , the day is not far off when essentially all executions in the United States will take place in Texas .

SOUTH HADLEY , Mass . --
It all seems so innocent .
Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft wants to unleash the FBI to surf the Web for possible terrorists .
And it could be , except for the insidious fact that each time politicians have " unleashed " an investigative agency , even for the best of reasons , bad things have happened without improving security .
In 1970 , I wrote an article about the Army 's surveillance of civil rights and anti-war movements .
Its domestic - spying program employed 1,500 agents and was undertaken without authority from Congress , the president or even the secretary of the Army .
My name was soon added to President Nixon 's " enemies list " for a tax audit .
The Army tried to monitor my incoming mail .
Shortly before I was to testify before North Carolina Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr.'s subcommittee on constitutional rights ,
Army colonels falsely informed committee staffers that I had fathered illegitimate children .
It was the stuff of intimidation -- and it worked most of the time .
Many former FBI agents said they would only provide information to the Senate subcommittee if their identities were not disclosed ; few dared testify in public .
In 1972 , I was hired by Ervin 's committee to analyze the information , stored on six computers , that the Army had obtained from its domestic political spying .
The files showed that the Army had clearly violated the privacy and free - speech rights of hundreds of thousands of law - abiding Americans .
But they also revealed how useless the spying had been -- not one report pointed to any foreign or criminal involvement in domestic political protests .
Other domestic - spying programs have been similarly fruitless .
In the 1950s and 1960s , the FBI , the Army , the CIA and many police department " red squads " clipped newspapers and attended public meetings with the aim of identifying people sympathetic to communists .
Their agents also infiltrated many law - abiding groups in search of " reds " or fellow travelers .
The Army , whose only domestic duty was to put down riots , eventually spied on every demonstration of 20 people or more .
But all this snooping never predicted a riot or uncovered any plot , communist or otherwise , to turn a lawful protest into a criminal attack .
During the Cold War , the FBI undertook more than 500,000 counterintelligence investigations against domestic political groups .
Not one produced an indictment .
Yet the investigations gradually changed the character of the agency , from one chiefly concerned with law enforcement to one centered on spying .
Trouble was , the more the FBI thought of itself as an intelligence agency , the less it felt restrained by law .
Without a statutory charter , Justice Department guidelines or meaningful legislative oversight , the bureau conducted thousands of burglaries , called " black bag " jobs , and opened hundreds of thousands of first - class letters .
It also bugged , without warrants , people not suspected of any crimes .
Nixon 's secret plan , hatched in late 1970 , to use the FBI , Army and CIA to spy on critics of the Vietnam War ultimately contributed to his downfall , sent his attorney general to prison and persuaded the FBI to adopt the very guidelines that Ashcroft now finds " outdated " in the war against terrorism .
But without those guidelines , harassment and dirty tricks are likely to be acceptable again as long as they are directed against suspected terrorists and their sympathizers and as long as the Bush administration can plausibly deny authorizing them .
Some say that would be OK if the spying helps protect us from terrorists .
But the opposite is more likely to occur .
The investigations Ashcroft envisions are almost certain to inundate analysts with so much irrelevant information that they wo n't be able to separate meaningful signals from the static .
Whether there was a significant intelligence failure leading up to Sept. 11 remains to be seen .
If there was one , however , it probably resembled the failure that left Pearl Harbor unguarded Dec. 7 , 1941 : the inability to collate and analyze useful signals from many sources in time to prevent a surprise attack .
One of the great benefits of the " outdated " FBI guidelines was that they protected the bureau from wasting limited resources vacuuming up domestic political trivia .
Good intelligence work , like good sleuthing , requires a disciplined , focused , well - coordinated exploitation of promising leads .
The war against Al Qaeda will not be won at home .
Mohamed Atta , the director of the Sept. 11 attacks , did n't reveal his plans in an Internet chat room .
So , instead of unleashing FBI agents to spy on Middle Easterners in the United States , the government should hire hundreds of foreign - born linguists on a contract basis and send them off to track down leads in Pakistan , Indonesia or Kashmir .
Other linguists should be hired to analyze the results , much as we used Japanese Americans to read Japanese code traffic during World War II .
And most of these linguists should not be integrated into existing agencies .
They should be assigned to new units free of the usual bureaucratic impediments to curiosity , imagination and initiative .
Would such measures prevent another terrorist attack in the United States ?
Probably not , but they will do more good and less harm than assigning English - only white guys to hang around New Jersey mosques or to monitor chat lines in Peoria .

Reports of ' Voter Fraud ' in Dixville Notch , Dem Ballots Unavailable to Voters , Both Debunked by The BRAD BLOG
Though Reasons Remain for Concern About Tabulation on Diebold Machines ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/8/2008 , 5:42 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
Our Spidey - sense started tingling before going to bed last night and hearing reports , on MSNBC , that there were 17 paper ballots cast in Dixville Notch , NH , in its midnight , first - in - the - country voting .
The report said that there were only 16 registered voters in the tiny voting precinct , yet 17 votes had been cast --- suggesting that somehow , paper ballot " voter fraud " skullduggery was afoot .
Following on that , reports throughout the day appeared that NH precincts were out of paper ballots , and voters were unable to vote .
Trouble is , both reports are either completely untrue , or wholly misleading , or both , as The BRAD BLOG was able to confirm with two simple phone calls .
Each of those reports , however , would seem to go a long way towards giving the impression that paper ballots are a bad idea , and that " voter fraud " is easy to commit when using them .
Given that one of those reports seems to have begun on The DRUDGE REPORT earlier today , we 're not particularly surprised that the MSM kept repeating the easily - debunked stories running all day .
That , even while there are reasons to be concerned about how the paper ballots used in the New Hampshire Primary will actually be counted by the hackable Diebold optical - scan systems used in the state , as controlled and programmed by an outrageously bad private contractor there ...
The Irresponsible Dixville Notch ' Voter Fraud ' Rumor
First , as to the mainstream media debunking , we spoke to the Dixville Notch , NH , Town Clerk , Rick Erwin , who explained exactly what happened concerning the 17 ballots cast last night .
ABC News even spoke to Erwin themselves , according to their report .
Yet still , they managed to scurrilously misreport the same irresponsible " voter fraud in Dixville Notch " rumor today .
The report , filed by ABC's Karen Travers , was published on their website today at 3:40 pm ET --- an hour surely late enough to have actually confirmed the nonsense about the midnight voting last night , as we did , before running it on their website .
Their report , as The BRAD BLOG bothered to confirm , was utter nonsense from the beginning !...
[ T ] here were 17 votes cast tonight .
Yet Dixville Notch town clerk Rick Erwin told ABC
News this afternoon that there are only 16 residents of voting age in the town --- three registered Republicans , two Democrats and 12 registered as undeclared .
Will Dixville Notch go down as the first voting irregularity of this election ?
Probably !
But only because ABC News misreported it as such !
Town Clerk Erwin explained to us what really happened .
" Yeah , that was due to the New Hampshire law that allows people to register on election day when the polls open , " Erwin explained to The BRAD BLOG in a phone call within the last hour .
" We had a gentleman who lived here , who moved away and came back --- the grandson of the man who started the tradition [ of voting at midnight in Dixville Notch ] , incidentally --- he moved back , but missed the cut - off date for getting onto the registration rolls . "
Erwin confirmed that yes , prior to the polls opening , there were just 16 registered voters in the tiny town , but after the new voter registered to vote , the total of 17 ballots cast as counted and reported was exactly right .
The news reports to the contrary are extraordinarily irresponsible .
Especially given the case being heard in the U.S. Supreme Court tomorrow concerning Photo ID restrictions at the polls , where Republicans have used a great deal of disinformation to suggest there is a massive epidemic of polling place " voter fraud " that requires such laws to be implemented .
That , despite the fact that some 10 to 30 million --- largely Democratic - leaning --- voters do n't have driver 's licenses that would meet the requirement .
Such laws , as the Indiana case being heard tomorrow before the SCOTUS , have been regarded as a " modern day Jim Crow - era poll tax " by a number of federal judges , and election experts alike , who have found such laws unconstitutional .
For the record , we also confirmed that the paper ballots used in Dixville Notch are counted by hand , transparently , " in front of a million people , " Erwin hastened to add .
Every Voter Was Able to Vote on a Paper Ballot in NH
Our Spidey - sense continued to tingle throughout the day , as we saw reports that indicated paper ballots had run out in voting precincts across the state , due to a larger - than - expected Democratic turnout .
As if to say : " Had there only been electronic voting machines in New Hampshire , this sort of thing would n't have happened . "
Trouble is , a quick call to the NH Sec. of State 's office quickly debunked that report as well .
" There 's a lot of disinformation , yes , " Assistant Sec. of State Karen Ladd told The BRAD BLOG after we'd bothered to call the office tonight at around 7:00 pm ET .
" We were getting a lot of disinformation , calls from the media , that towns were running out of ballots , and that was not true . "
While there were concerns among some of the towns and wards that they might run out of ballots later in the day , due to the large Democratic turnout , Ladd confirmed that it was n't until 6 pm that " a few " places , " a coupla towns , " actually did run out of ballots .
In the few instances where that happened , she told us , the clerks simply gave paper absentee ballots to voters .
If those ran out , they made xerox copies of paper ballots for voters to vote on .
" So there will be a ballot from everybody .
Nobody will be denied the right to vote because they ran out of ballots , " Ladd assured us .
So where did this rumor begin , we asked her , in reference to her comment about " disinformation " ?
Apparently --- surprise , surprise --- The DRUDGE REPORT !
" The Drudge Report , that 's where it started , " she told us , " and everybody picked up on it , and started calling " just after lunch , " around two - ish , " she explained .
But the report from the DRUDGE , largely regarded as a rightwing propaganda outlet , was wrong , she says .
" The fact is that nobody was running out of ballots .
Nobody had run out of ballots .
We did have calls that there was concerns that they might run out , but nobody did run out . "
Polls close at 7 pm ET in most New Hampshire precincts , and at 8 pm ET in a few of them .
The only large town voting precinct to run out of paper ballots , late in the day , was Londerry , Ladd said , and they simply made photocopies to ensure that every voter could vote .
All ballots are counted at the polls , either by hand or optical - scan systems , and results are announced and / or posted at the precincts before being shipped back to the Secretary of State , Ladd told us .
As it should be .
What You Should Actually Be Concerned About
However , for those in the media interested in actual concerns about the integrity of today 's NH Primary , we 'd strongly recommend the following video primer .
In it , you 'll learn that the Diebold optical - scan system used across most of New Hampshire ( some 40 % of precincts still count paper ballots by hand , at the precinct ) , can be easily rigged by insiders , and only if the paper ballots are properly audited by hand , in some fashion , can the results of the op - scanners be trusted in any way , shape , or form .
Reporters would do well to take note , particularly given the tightness of the race at this hour on the Democratic side , between Obama and Clinton --- curious , given the final Zogby polling numbers which were dead - on on the Republican side , but , so far , seem wildly off on the Dem side .
Zogby 's numbers had predicted an Obama blowout , 42/29 over Clinton .
The machines used in the state are the same ones seen being hacked in HBO 's documentary , Hacking Democracy .
As well , a single private company with a very bad record , LHS Associates , Diebold 's exclusive distributor and technical contractor in New England , runs the elections and controls the vulnerable memory cards for the voting systems across the state .
That company has an horrendous record of lax security policies and has admitted to having replaced memory cards , on a whim , on their own , in the middle of past elections .
As well , their Director of Sales and Marketing , Ken Hajaar , has previously posted a comment on The BRAD BLOG under his own name , declaring : " You are totally full of shit . "
His tirade went on against those concerned about transparency and Election Integrity , such as ourselves and BlackBoxVoting.org 's Bev Harris to be " deluded , " " paranoid . " and " loony ideologues . "
His comments here succeeded only having him be banned from working on elections in Connecticut by the Sec. of State there , where LHS Associates also irresponsibly and secretly ply their trade at taxpayer expense .
The video below shows LHS Associate President John Silvestro challenging Finnish computer security expert Harri Hursti , during testimony in New Hampshire , after Hursti's landmark hack of a Diebold optical - scan machine in late 2005 in Leon County , FL , as seen in Hacking Democracy .
That hack is again shown in this video , courtesy of BlackBoxVoting.org ...
UPDATE 9:04 pm PT : We 'd say the numbers coming out of New Hampshire tonight , as compared to the pre-election polling , offer good reason to be concerned about the points above .

We will bother to get the story right , even if the corporate mainstream media wo n't during this important Presidential Election year !
The wealthy have always used many methods to accumulate wealth , but it was not until the mid-1970s that these methods coalesced into a superbly organized , cohesive and efficient machine .
After 1975 , it became greater than the sum of its parts , a smooth flowing organization of advocacy groups , lobbyists , think tanks , conservative foundations , and PR firms that hurtled the richest 1 percent into the stratosphere .
-- Steve Kangas , The Origins of the Overclass
The origins of this machine , interestingly enough , can be traced back to the CIA .
This is not to say the machine is a formal CIA operation , complete with code name and signed documents .
( Although such evidence may yet surface - and previously unthinkable domestic operations such as MK - ULTRA , CHAOS and MOCKINGBIRD show this to be a distinct possibility . )
But what we do know already indicts the CIA strongly enough .
Its principle creators were Irving Kristol , Paul Weyrich , William Simon , Richard Mellon Scaife , Frank Shakespeare , William F. Buckley , Jr. , the Rockefeller family , and more .
Almost all the machine 's creators had CIA backgrounds .
How did this alliance start ?
The CIA has always recruited the nation 's elite : millionaire businessmen , Wall Street brokers , members of the national news media , and Ivy League scholars .
During World War II , General " Wild Bill " Donovan became chief of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , the forerunner of the CIA .
Donovan recruited so exclusively from the nation 's rich and powerful that members eventually came to joke that " OSS " stood for " Oh , so social ! "
By the 1950s , the CIA had riddled the nation 's businesses , media and universities with tens of thousands of part - time , on - call operatives .
Their employment with the agency took a variety of forms , which included :
Leaving one 's profession to work for the CIA in a formal , official capacity .
Staying in one 's profession , using the job as cover for CIA activity .
This undercover activity could be full - time , part - time , or on - call .
Staying in one 's profession , occasionally passing along information useful to the CIA .
Passing through the revolving door that has always existed between the agency and the business world .
Many common traits made it inevitable that the CIA and Corporate America would become allies .
Both share an intense dislike of democracy , and feel they should be liberated from democratic regulations and oversight .
Both share a culture of secrecy , either hiding their actions from the American public or lying about them to present the best public image .
And both are in a perfect position to help each other .
The CIA 's alliance with the elite turned out to be an unholy one .
Each enabled the other to rise above the law .
Indeed , a review of the CIA 's history is one of such crime and atrocity that no one can reasonably defend it , even in the name of anticommunism .
Before reviewing this alliance in detail , it is useful to know the CIA 's history of atrocity first .

Here 's a breakdown of some of the other Scientologese words , acronyms and turns of phrase — culled from a variety of sources , including books , Web sites , and current and former church members — that might get lost in translation :
LRH : L. Ron Hubbard , founder of the Church of Scientology and author of sci- fi books such as " Battlefield Earth " and " Mission Earth . "
" I take this as a half - ack " : What was that sound ?
A furball ?
Actually , a " half - ack " — a half - acknowledgement — means you were encouraged .
In LRH 's communication theory , you have to give signals to pre-clears ( people who have not yet " cleared " themselves of unwanted emotions ) — like " good , " " OK , " " I got that . "
Get that ?
KSW : Keeping Scientology Working .
Refers to a policy LRH published in 1965 that requires all Scientologists to follow his words and rules exactly .
" It is something that you have to earn " : Cruise is referring to taking Scientology courses .
According to the church , to get to the higher levels of Scientology — he's an OT VII , the highest level is OT VIII — you must complete a number of courses and auditing sessions , a sort of Scientological take on the Catholic confession .
And it all costs ; depending on your level , the tab for wisdom can be hundreds if not thousands of dollars .
To finally learn what the basis of Scientology 's precepts are ( about how we got remnants of space aliens known as thetans trapped in our system ) , you must attain the level of OT III .
The secrets of Xenu are n't free !
" Am I going to look at that guy or am I too afraid ? " :
Cruise 's relentless stare is actually a technique from " Success Through Communication " training routine ( TR ) drills .
According to former and current members , pre-clears have to learn to look someone straight in the eye for hours .
It 's supposed to generate self - confidence and intimidate the other party .
No blinking !
" ... Because I have my own out - ethics " :
The church says ethics are moral choices but belong to a distinct moral system , based on LRH 's book " Introduction to Scientology Ethics . "
If you misbehave , you have " out - ethics . "
If you 're behaving , you have your ethics " in . "
To put your ethics " in " someone else , as Cruise later says , is to make someone else conform .
" The ability to create new and better realities and improve conditions " : " Conditions " refer to LRH principles , which are charted on a scale .
It 's a Scientologist 's goal to " improve conditions , " which means improving your relationship with yourself and to those within your group .
The " conditions " ( in order ) are : confusion , treason , enemy , doubt , liability , nonexistence , danger , emergency , normal , affluence , power change and power , according to numerous accounts of church practices .
These are the practical applications of " ethics . "
Tech : Otherwise known as " ethics tech . "
The methods and principles learned in Scientology courses .
" Orgs are there to help " : Not Orcs from " Lord of the Rings " — orgs , as in Scientology churches and other organizations , such as Narconon , Criminon and Second Chance , all of which can be found online .
Criminon : Scientology group that recruits through prisons , promising alcohol and drug rehabilitation .
SP : " Suppressive Person . "
An SP is someone who commits suppressive acts , like murder , criticizing Scientology or altering LRH 's teachings , according to former and current members .
Journalists are automatically considered SPs because they traffic in bad news and so are barred from entering Scientology .
Psychiatrists would also be SPs , so Cruise says , " Crush these guys !
I 've had it !
No mercy !
None !
Go to guns ! " as a call to arms .
Since all 's fair in war , LRH once issued a policy called " Fair Game " that decreed that anyone who opposed Scientology could be " tricked , sued or lied to and destroyed . "
The church says it no longer officially practices this , however , it is still a fairly contentious organization .
PTS : " Potential Trouble Sources , " as in Scientologists who are losing the faith or are being influenced by an SP .
PTS /SP : A course in how to " handle " and / or " disconnect " PTS and SPs , which usually costs about $ 1,600 , according to estimates from church members .
" Ways to Happiness " : Actually , " A Way to Happiness , " a booklet of the Scientology version of the 10 Commandments , except theirs has 21 Commandments .
The number - one precept is " Take Care of Yourself . "
Also on the list : " Do n't Be Promiscuous , " " Set a Good Example , " " Do Not Murder , " " Do Not Harm a Person of Good Will " and " Flourish and Prosper . "
Perhaps " Star Trek " creator Gene Roddenberry said it more succinctly : " Live long and prosper . "
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) is trying to convince European lawmakers that ISPs should take extreme measures to fight piracy .
They suggest that ISPs should block access to websites such as The Pirate Bay , and block filesharing protocols , no matter what they 're being used for .
The IFPI – the anti-piracy organization that represents the recording industry worldwide – sees ISPs as one of their biggest enemies .
“ ISPs often advertise music as a benefit of signing up to their service , but facilitate the illegal swapping of copyright infringing music on a grand scale , ” they said previously .
In an attempt to restrict the Internet , the anti-pirates have sent a list of three absurd recommendations to the EU parliament .
Earlier this year the IFPI won a case against the Belgian ISP Scarlet .
In this case the judge ruled that ISPs can be forced to either block or filter copyright infringing content on P2P networks .
At the time , IFPI Chairman and CEO John Kennedy said : “ This is a decision that we hope will set the mould for government policy and for courts in other countries in Europe and around the world . ”
That ’s exactly what they are trying to do now .
None of the measures below are overly burdensome or expensive , or cause problems for regular services to customers , says the IFPI .
Here ’s what they recommend :
Content filtering
The IFPI suggests that ISPs should identify music files on their network and check them against a reference database of “ audio fingerprints ” to check whether the files are infringing copyright .
This might work on Kazaa , but it is not clear what methods the ISP will have to implement to distinguish between copyright infringing and legal content on P2P networks , such as BitTorrent .
That will be a tough job , if not , impossible .
Protocol Blocking
According to the IFPI , an easy but effective solution is to simply block all P2P protocols and forget about all the indie publishers that use it to share legal content , for free .
If customers ca n’t use BitTorrent or any other filesharing protocol piracy will decline , and that ’s basically all they care about .
Blocking access to infringing websites
What better way to censor the Internet than to block entire websites , especially The Pirate Bay .
The IFPI tried to block websites before – last year they convinced a Swedish ISP ( Perspectiv ) that it was a good idea to block allofmp3 .
However , after The Pirate Bay decided to block all Perspectiv ’s customers from its site , they backed down , re-enabled access to allofmp3 – and apologized .
These recommendations might seem absurd , but Heise .
de reports that the IFPI has already convinced several European politicians to support these measures .
Next month , The Committee on Culture and Education from the European parliament will discuss if these recommendations should be turned into European policy .
There is little doubt that it will cause quite a stir if they are .

The Bush administration ’s decision to deny California permission to regulate and reduce global warming emissions from cars and trucks is an indefensible act of executive arrogance that can only be explained as the product of ideological blindness and as a political payoff to the automobile industry .
The decision , announced Wednesday by Stephen Johnson , the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , overrode the advice of his legal and technical staffs , misconstrued the law and defied both Congress and the federal courts .
It also stuck a thumb in the eyes of 17 other state governors who have grown impatient with the federal government ’s failure to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and wanted to move aggressively on their own .
The Clean Air Act of 1970 gave California authority to set its own clean air standards if it first received a federal waiver .
The law also said that other states could then adopt California ’s standards .
In 2004 , California asked permission to move ahead with a law requiring automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and light trucks by 30 percent by 2016 .
That would require improvements in fuel economy far beyond those called for in the energy bill signed this week .
Over the years , California has made 50 waiver requests to regulate smog - forming pollutants and other gases and has never been denied .
This was the first request involving emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , which the Bush administration has steadfastly refused to regulate .
HARTFORD , Conn ( Reuters ) -
The housing market is headed for its worst performance in 50 years , and the drop in home prices could accelerate if the economy weakens , Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said Tuesday .
He said previous downturns in the mortgage sector were generally associated with hard economic times , although he steered clear of predicting a recession .
“ History may or may not repeat itself , ” he told an audience of industry executives at a meeting of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association .
“ My view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of a more significant downturn in the overall economy , ” he said .
Noting that prices have declined substantially even in a relatively benign economic environment , he said it was possible that they could fall more rapidly should economic performance not remain strong in 2008 .
On the positive side , Rosengren noted that the current housing debacle has taken place amid a relatively stable labor market , although he observed that Friday ’s disappointing jobs report could signal a shift .
The data showed employment was almost at a standstill , with the unemployment rate jumping from 4.7 percent to 5.0 percent .
Such readings have heightened speculation that the Fed might cut interest rates by as much as a half percentage point later this month .
Rosengren outlined some of the effects of the mortgage meltdown on the financial markets including the effects of derivative securities , saying that past experience suggests prompt recognition of losses would be optimal .
He took a swipe at those who had said the events currently underway could never take place .
“ On our list of New Year ’s resolutions , I would include not listening to pundits who claimed 1 . that housing prices could not go down nationally , 2 . that triple - A ratings meant no default risk and 3 .
that calculating fair market value was easy for mortgage products . ”
He drew on the experiences of New England and Japan to argue that coming to terms with losses was a painful but necessary process .
Financial markets have been severely hampered in recent months by a growing mistrust among banks over who might hold what mortgage - linked securities .
Wall Street banks have announced tens of billions of dollars in writedowns , but many worry there is more to come .

The Pew Internet research team recently published a poll saying less than half of us have ever performed an “ ego search , ” or an internet search of ourselves , using either Google or some other search engine .
From the AP here :
More Americans are Googling themselves — and many are checking out their friends , co-workers and romantic interests , too .
In a report Sunday , the Pew Internet and American Life Project said 47 percent of U.S. adult Internet users have looked for information about themselves through Google or another search engine .
That is more than twice the 22 percent of users who did in 2002 , but Pew senior research specialist Mary Madden was surprised the growth was n’t higher .
“ Yes it ’s doubled , but it ’s still the case that there ’s a big chunk of Internet users who have never done this simple act of plugging their name with search engines , ” she said .
“ Certainly awareness has increased , but I do n’t know it ’s necessarily kept pace with the amount of content we post about ourselves or what others post about us . ”
What if other people Google you ?
Are you concerned what someone might find out about you by performing a routine search ?
What if that person was a prospective employer ?
Or a business partner ?
For anyone concerned with their online privacy , it is important to perform ego searches regularly for not only your own name , but for your e-mail address , your home address and even your social security number .
In most cases , we tend to publish our own information on the Internet .
We might not have intended to post our personal information in a public forum , but sometimes leaks of information happen or we were careless when responding to a blog posting or someone ’s guestbook page .
Search your name : Unless your name is extremely common , like Jack Johnson , Charlie Smith or Cathy Brown , it is not that difficult to retrieve your name from an Internet search — depending on what search tools you use and how careful you were to keep your name off the Internet .
If you are a homeowner , chances are your name is in at least one publicly searchable database .
And if you signed up for LinkedIn , Amazon.com , Facebook or even MySpace , you likely used your real name when registering , and that information is searchable too .
To search , begin with Google since it is the most ubiquitous , and use quotes around your name .
You may want to narrow the search by including your state , territory or hometown , depending on how common your name may be .
Another great search tool is Spock.com .
Spock specializes in searching social networks like MySpace , Facebook , Hi5 and LiveJournal as well as Linked In .
And it also acts like its own social networking site allowing users to verify tags about people to aid in people search accuracy .
Finally , try to use Pipl.com .
Pipl combines a Google Search with Zaba search , Ancestry.com , yellowpages.com and social networking sites such as LinkedIn and MySpace .
It also does Web “ deep searches ” and will pull hits off of your Amazon.com wish lists and reviews , as well .
Search your nickname .
Some people have great online nicknames , but then make the mistake of writing their real name on their Facebook page right under that awesome nickname .
If that nickname was used in a profane political rant , it can still be tied to you .
Search for your e-mail address .
This is an often - overlooked ego search .
Check Google for Web postings , but do n’t forget to check newsgroups too .
If someone is trying to track you down online and they know your email address ( for instance , off of your resume ) , they can try to use that information to learn more about your identity by seeing what else you have written online or emailed to public forums .
Search other personal information .
You can search for your home address and social security numbers , too .
You may be horrified to discover that someone has posted an excel spreadsheet on a server somewhere containing your and 10,000 other people ’s social security numbers , and Google found it .
Or maybe it shows up in a legal document online where it ’s not supposed to be .
If your information is exposed , there is not much you can do about public records such as home purchases , marriage licenses , or other legal documents .
But if your name is associated with an old MySpace account you no longer use , you can get the old accounts closed .
Other items , such as blog posts or comments in forums that may tie you to politically incorrect statements , can often be deleted if you ask the forum or blog operators .
To completely avoid tying your real identity to online accounts , you should strictly use fabricated names and accounts that wo n’t be traced back to you .
BOULDER , Colo . — About 50 Boulder High School students walked out of class Thursday to protest the daily reading of the Pledge of Allegiance and recited their own version , omitting “ one nation , under God . ”
The students say the phrase violates the constitutional separation of church and state .
They also say the daily reading of the pledge over the school public address system at the start of the second class takes away from education time and is ignored or mocked by some students .
A state law passed in 2004 requires schools to offer the opportunity to recite the pledge each day but does not require students to participate .
The protesting students , members of the Student Worker Club , want administrators to hold the pledge reading in the auditorium during each of the school ’s two lunch periods for any students who want to participate .
Otherwise , they said , they plan to walk out each Thursday when the pledge is read and recite their version , which omits the reference to God and adds allegiance to constitutional rights , diversity and freedom , among other things .
“ Boulder High has a highly diverse population , not all of whom believe in God , or one God , ” said Emma Martens , a senior and president of the club , which has about a dozen members .
“ We did n’t think it was fair for the whole school to have to listen to it .
It ’s almost religious oppression , ” she said .
Principal Bud Jenkins told the Camera newspaper on its Web site Thursday the pledge will not be moved , but added he was proud of the students for standing up for their beliefs .
It was not immediately clear what discipline , if any , the protesting students would face .

As I begin working on my second book I ’ve gone back and realized that there ’s a lot of things that I wish I knew before I started writing my first book way back in March of 2006 .
One of the big ones was the volume of book sales and the amount of profit made .
Namely : Programming books ( by - and - large ) are poor sellers , thus , do n’t expect to be buying a new mansion anytime soon .
I recently received my quarterly update from Apress for the 3rd quarter of 2007 ( the fourth quarter of the book ’s existence ) .
This was the first quarter in which I actually broke a profit ( received money in excess of my advance ) so I was quite pleased .
Here ’s a scan for those that are interested .
Publisher Revenue
Here ’s some things that I learned about book profits , in no particular order :
When you negotiate a contract with a publisher , and you receive an advance , that ’s an advance of your future profits .
I had no idea why I never realized this until after I received my first statement and saw - $ 3000 listed as my payout .
It makes a lot of sense , in retrospect – but it was just a silly thing that never quite clicked with me .
Advances are distributed in even chunks based upon milestones .
( Finish X number of chapters , get 1 / 4 of the advance – get the last 1/4 when the book is complete . )
I negotiated a higher advance than what ’s typical as I wanted to use it to live off of post - college , Apress was nice and accommodating .
Advances are usually pretty low ( I think Apress ’ typical one was $ 5000 for a first - time author ) .
In talking with authors at other publishers you can usually expect something in that range – maybe slightly higher .
No one buys eBooks .
You ’d have to be pretty … special … in order to not be able to find a free ebook of Pro JavaScript Techniques .
Ever wonder how an author tracks how many books they ’re selling ?
Guess what , he dose n’t !
It ’s a massive mystery !
When I chatted with my editor , on a number of occasions , most of the conversations just ended with him making a sad face and saying “ just watch your Amazon numbers . ”
So that ’s what you do – you watch your Amazon page like a hawk , trying to divine some special meaning from the crazy fluctuations in your sales rank .
A couple rules of thumb that Chris Mills ( my editor ) taught me for tracking your Amazon sales rank ( for programming books , especially ) is :
If your rank is < 10,000 , you 're doing fantastic , < 20,000 , you 're doing very well , < 100,000 , reasonable , anything else and you 're effectively dead .
Tracking my ranking over the past year it's been consistently in the 10 - 20,000 range , with occasional dips into the < 10,000 range .
JavaScript : The Definitive Guide is always < 5,000 ( for comparison ) .
The vast majority of technical books will never sell more than 4000 copies .
Unless you ’ve really tapped into something good , are targeting a huge audience , or have done a really outstanding job , it ’s likely that your book will sell around the same amount .
Publishers do very little promotion of your work .
I guess , unless , you ’re going with a real powerhouse like O’Reilly ( where they can rope you into conferences and all sorts of promotions ) most technical publishers have little leeway outside of “ sending free books to influential people and praying that they ’ll blog about them . ”
I really like the tiered payout structure that Apress provides – it rewards authors who put a lot of work into the promotion , and quality , of their work .
Releasing your book before Christmas is awesome .
Geeks love to add books to their Christmas lists ( they ’re cheaper than gadgets and safe for family members to acquire ) .
The book was released December 11th and yet it still sold over 2,000 copies in the remaining 20 days of the quarter , in 2006 .
Do n’t force your friends to buy your book , authors always get a massive pile of their book to give away at user groups , etc. – hang on to some and save your friends $ 30 .
I ’m not 100 % sure what the “ licensed rights ” are , mentioned in the printout above , but I think it relates to translated copies of the book ( I ’ve been told that there ’s a Chinese version – there may be others ) .
When you go over a certain amount of profit publishers will hold some in “ reserve ” as a measure to counter - act returned copies , from the distributors .
I ’m not sure how much of a real concern this is , but it seems sketchy to me .
I ’m not sure how useful all of this will be for would - be - authors but I wish I knew these tips back before I got started , so very long ago .
I hope to drop some more of these tid-bits , as I remember them , throughout the rest of the authoring process .
When Mike Huckabee became lieutenant governor of Arkansas in 1993 , he complained of being burdened by college tuition bills for his son , the expenses of two residences  one in Texarkana and the other in Little Rock  and the cost of commuting between the two .
With an annual salary of $ 25,452 , he said he was falling short in covering the bills .
“ It was costing me money to be lieutenant governor , ” Mr. Huckabee recalled in a 1997 newspaper interview .
To bridge the gap between his income and his expenses , Mr. Huckabee and a few close political advisers came up with a plan .
They formed a nonprofit organization that raised money for Mr. Huckabee to travel the country promoting conservative politics to fellow ministers and attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s health care plan .
In its three - year life span , the organization , Action America , collected $ 119,916 from a dozen or so donors .
Among them were former Senator Bob Dole ’s political action committee , an Arkansas cotton gin owner who had been jailed for stock fraud , and R. J. Reynolds , the tobacco giant that had opposed the Clinton health plan .
As for Mr. Huckabee , he ended up with $ 61,500 for his efforts before becoming governor in July 1996 and shuttering the group .
The American War Upon the World
By : Peter Chamberlin
In researching the events leading to America ’s downfall , I have had to continually readjust my understanding of the situation as new information surfaced .
Throughout the entire learning process it has proven especially difficult to determine whether the CIA determines the secret policies it carries out , or if the agency merely serve as a loyal tool to the moneymen who control the world from behind the scenes .
It is very difficult to sort out the facts from the fabrication about an ongoing disinformation campaign while immersed in it .
I used to think that the “ new right ” was simply a merger between militarist corporate interests and right wing militant groups , and that the CIA was merely a servant to whoever was in power .
But I have come to realize that the spy agency was instrumental in creating the “ Reagan revolution ” and the “ neoconservatives ” who were spawned by it .
At first it seemed that the confluence of CIA dirty tricks with the Republican national politics was limited to agents helping - out their former boss .
But it became apparent that there had been a strategic merger between the CIA , the Republican Party and corporate America .
Names like Nelson Rockefeller and Nelson Bunker Hunt ( of the infamous Hunt brothers ) show up as major financiers in the new right “ conservative movement . ”
Researcher Steve Kangas reported ( shortly before his murder ) on the connections between radical Republican billionaires and the early neocons , most of whom had previous CIA experience .
Kangas was found shot to death outside the Pittsburgh offices of right - wing benefactor Richard Mellon Scaife , who gave millions to right wing groups trying to destroy President Clinton , including the Heritage Foundation and New Gingrich ’s Free Congress Foundation .
http://msnoh.tripod.com/kang.html
Before Kangas died , he produced a lengthy report titled , “ How the CIA Created a Ruling , Corporate Overclass in America ” that may have gotten him killed .

“ From 1973 to 1975 , Scaife ran Forum World Features , a foreign news service used as a front to disseminate CIA propaganda around the world .
Shortly afterwards he began donating millions to fund the New Right .
The political machine they built is broad and comprehensive , covering every aspect of the political fight .
It includes right - wing departments and chairs in the nation ’s top universities , think tanks , public relations firms , media companies , fake grassroots organizations that pressure Congress ...
The CIA also helped create the conservative think tank movement ...
The Heritage Foundation opened its doors in 1973 , the recipient of $ 250,000 in seed money from the Coors Foundation .
A flood of conservative think tanks followed shortly thereafter , and by 1980 they overwhelmed the scene .
The new think tanks turned out to be little more than propaganda mills , rigging studies to ‘ prove ’ that their corporate sponsors needed tax breaks , deregulation and other favors from government ...
Using propaganda techniques it had perfected at the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe , the CIA and its allies turned American AM radio into a haven for conservative talk shows ... The origins of this machine , interestingly enough , can be traced back to the CIA ... Its principle creators were [ neoconservatives ]
Irving Kristol , Paul Weyrich , William Simon , Richard Mellon Scaife , Frank Shakespeare , William F. Buckley , Jr. , the Rockefeller family ... these men would take the propaganda and operational techniques they had learned in the Cold War and apply them to the Class War .
Therefore it is no surprise that the American version of the machine bears an uncanny resemblance to the foreign versions designed to fight communism ... ”
The radical neocon attack machine was constructed under CIA guidance to incorporate the political strategies that they had perfected while waging covert political warfare against our European allies , as well as other friends and enemies throughout the world .
The politics of fear that underlie the “ war on terrorism , ” derive from the “ strategy of tension ” that the agency developed in Italy .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension
“ A strategy of tension ( Italian : strategia della tensione ) is a way to control and manipulate public opinion using fear , propaganda , disinformation , psychological warfare , agents provocateurs , as well as false flag terrorist actions ( including bombings ) .
According to historian Daniele Ganser , " It is a tactic which consists in committing bombings and attributing them to others .
By the term ' tension ' one refers to emotional tension , to what creates a sentiment of fear .
By the term ' strategy ' one refers to what feeds the fear of the people towards one particular group " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension

This is a great idea .
However , it needs to be more mobile .
If I could access this from my PDA / Phone ( Blackberry ) , then I think I would use it every day .
[ www.trapster.com] does exactly this .
You push a button when you see a trap , others ' phones beep as they approach it .
Works on Windows Mobile , BlackBerry , most smartphones , and any phone that has Where.com .
Nokia / Symbian version soon .
It supports either GPS or WiFi location via Skyhook .
If you do n't want to run the program on your phone you can also just report traps ( via Jott ) by calling a toll free number , and get alerts about traps others have reported via SMD .
It has a confidence algorithm that learns credibility of traps , and credibility of users over time .
Even though you can add , say , red light camera or usual speed trap locations to a map on Trapster , it 's not intended to be yet another Google mashups - meets - speedtrap.org .
It 's a real - time peer - to - peer speed trap sharing system for mobile phones and other devices .
And it is patented .
You just knew it would happen , and it has - someone in Detroit is whining that the new 35 mpg fuel economy standard set to take effect in 13 years will be the end of the muscle car .
Uh-huh .
Sure it will .
Tadge Juetcher , chief engineer for the 2009 Chevrolet Corvette ZR - 1 , says the tougher fuel efficiency rule , coupled with efforts by the European Union and California to curb emissions , could make next year 's supervette the last in a long line of pavement - peeling Motor City muscle cars .
" High - performance vehicles such as this , " he told the Associated Press , referring to the supercharged Corvette General Motors will unveil next month at the Detroit auto show , " may actually be legislated out of existence .
It really could be an endangered species . "
Juetcher is n't the only one predicting we 'll all be driving Smart ForTwos and longing for the days when we could scare ourselves silly going zero to 60 in 3.7 seconds on our way to 200 mph .
One blogger goes so far as to say gearheads are doomed to a future no less miserable than " Sarah Connor in the movie Terminator 2 , who was haunted by visions of a dark and bleak future after a nuclear war . "
What makes it so funny is he 's completely serious .
And completely wrong .
We 're gearheads of the highest order here at Autopia .
We love going fast .
We 've driven some of the quickest production cars out there .
And we 're pretty excited about the future .
Clearly these people crying that the sky is falling are minimizing , if not completely overlooking , a key fact of the Energy Indepedence and Security Act of 2007 : automakers must increase the average fuel economy of their entire fleets - from the smallest econobox to the biggest SUV - by 40 percent , from 26.4 mpg to 35 mpg .
To hear some of these people whine , you 'd think the law requires every car that rolls off an assembly line in 2020 to get 35 mpg .
This means automakers like GM will keep building cars like the ZR1 ( 15 mpg city / 24 highway ) , but make them more fuel efficient while also producing more compacts and subcompacts ( which , by the way , are the fastest growing segment of the market ) like the Aveo 5 ( 24/34 ) that also will become thriftier .
GM and others might also begin offering Americans some of the highly efficient cars they are selling in Europe or developing for foreign markets ( such as the Chevrolet Beat , for example . )
GM , to continue the example , is making a huge investment in new engine technology , hybrid drivetrains , electric vehicles and other alternatives to fossil fuel .
All the automakers are charting a similar course , as we outlined in " How Detroit Will Reach 35 mpg , " because they all plan to keep building cars we actually want to buy - and that includes big honkin ' SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade and insanely fast sports cars like the Dodge Viper .
The alarmists also need a little perspective .
The 1964 Corvette with the 327 cubic - inch engine produced 375 horsepower and the 1965 Mustang with the " Hi - Po " 289 produced 271 horsepower .
( Note : figures are gross horsepower ; automakers began citing net horsepower figures in 1971 , so the ratings dropped even when measuring the same engine . )
Those are impressive figures , even by today 's standards .
Then came the 1970s and the gas crunch , emissions control systems and catalytic converters .
Purists lamented it would all spell the end of the muscle car and we'd all be driving Chevettes .
Yes , there were some pretty lean years for awhile , but the industry adapted and moved on .
Next year 's Corvette ZR1 will crank out 620 horsepower and the Bullitt edition of the Mustang will have 315 ( a Shelby edition planned for 2009 reportedly produces 540 ) .
Horsepower figures have roughly doubled in the past 20 - odd years , and at least 33 cars available in the United States produce 500 horsepower or more .
Anyone who thinks they 're all gonna disappear has been inhaling exhaust fumes too long .
In fact , some auto industry insiders and analysts say were at the dawning of a new horsepower war .
Putting aside the question of whether anyone needs that kind of power , you can argue the 35 mpg standard will make all cars - including high - performance vehicles - better .
Some of the first things Detroit will do to boost fuel efficiency are reduce weight , improve aerodynamics and reduce parasitic loads by replacing engine - driven components like power - steering pumps with electric parts .
That 's a sure - fire recipe for better performance even if horsepower figures decline significantly .
Things will only get better .
We 're going to see more engines with direct injection ( so far used mostly on very high performance vehicles ) , more turbochargers and more superchargers .
Six - and seven - speed transmissions will become commonplace .
There will be more hybrids - in everything from subcompacts to SUVs - more clean diesels and even electric cars coming down the pike .
Electric drag racers like KillaCycle and Current Eliminator V are pushing the boundaries of what batteries can do .
Alt - fuel vehicles are setting all sorts of speed records .
Mothers Polish and renowned car builder Chip Foose recently teamed up to build a 1,000 horsepower 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle powered by propane .
And then there 's the Tesla Roadster , which has redefined the electric vehicle and shown alt - fuel cars can be every bit as exciting as fossil - fuel burning super cars .
Thirty - five mpg will kill the muscle car ?
Do n't bet on it .
Who Are Your Enemies ?
Do You Have Enemies ?
In the wake of 9/11 , the conversations of our leaders , our media , as well as our own private conversations , have become filled with the idea of the enemy , and often the word itself .
Unfortunately the idea of the enemy is nothing new for us .
It was 60 years between the attack on Pearl Harbor and the domestic terrorist attack of 9/11 , but the time in between was not empty of war .
The United States has been in many wars throughout the years , large and small .
If war is a regular visitor to the United States , it is a resident in some countries .
The world remains full of war .
And there are no wars without enemies .
There are times when there are others who want to destroy us , others who seem deserving of the name enemy .
At other times , those who we do not understand , or who oppose us , are too readily called enemy .
Sometimes we make enemies of those who have different beliefs , languages , or skin color .
In recent times , the bitterness that often colors the conversations between Democrats and Republicans has become a conversation of enemies , rather than a discussion of ideas .
It does n’t matter what my politics are , or what your politics are .
Let ’s both resist the urge to mindlessly support our own side , and say that it ’s the fault of one side or the other .
Both sides are equally at fault .
There is an overwhelming bitterness that colors many discussions , on both sides of the aisle .
It ’s like an ancient feud between two families that is just waiting to break out into open war .
Each side just waits for an opportunity to attack the other side .
I ’m sick of it , and I hope that you are too .
If enough of us refuse to support this politics of enemies , there is hope that we can get our leaders to change .
If our politicians put that energy into real work , it would be a different world .
Public and Private Enemies
As our involvement in wars rises and falls , the idea of public enemies comes in and out of our conversations .
These are countries or ideologies that are said to threaten our country , way of life , etc .
And public enemies are not the only kind of enemy .
Each of us have private enemies .
Sure , we ’re uncomfortable with using that word , but we think of them as enemies nonetheless .
For some of us , our enemies are those who have inflicted us with great physical or emotional pain .
When we start thinking about the enemy , hate follows along like a shadow , poisons us , and makes life bitter .
Maybe there is some purpose in forever holding hate in our hearts , directed at those who have nearly destroyed us .
But I do n’t think so .
Hate does not empower us to protect what is precious in our lives from those who truly threaten us .
It makes us stupid , and it darkens our hearts .
And , while there are people who truly threaten and harm us , privately , or as a country , there are many other people who we only pretend are enemies .
Enemies and Blame
We ’re introduced to the idea of blame at a young age , and it ’s reinforced as we grow .
We do n’t like to think of ourselves as flawed , and full of conflict .
We do n’t like to admit that we ’ve made many mistakes .
And sometimes it ’s even simpler than that .
We face a challenge , and we find that we do n’t know what to do .
We do n’t like to admit that we ’re fallible , and imperfect , and sometimes clueless .
We do n’t want to feel embarrassed .
We do n’t want to return to that feeling of being a little child , with a world that ’s too big for us to handle .
Rather than face our discomfort , and work hard to find a solution , we settle for an easy way out :
It ’s his fault .
It ’s her fault .
It ’s their fault .
We pretend that the only reason that we have a problem is because of what someone else has done wrong .
We sidestep the truth .
We take a real challenge that we could work hard and grow from , and turn it into blame .
We do n’t have challenges .
No , we have problems .
And those problems are someone else ’s fault .
What is the truth when we find some difficulty in the midst of two sides that blame each other ?
Most likely , both sides have some share in causing that difficulty , and both sides probably have a role to play in finding a solution .
Enemies and Marketing
In Do You Hate Selling , I speak of Blair Warren ’s One Sentence Persuasion , and five powerful ways that can be used or abused to influence people .
People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams , justify their failures , allay their fears , confirm their suspicions and help them throw rocks at their enemies .
In other posts I ’ve discussed the first four methods of persuasion ( see links to these articles below ) .
The last method is help them throw rocks at their enemies .
Politicians , and people at every level of society , often slip into the easy way of enemies and blame .
Find , or manufacture an enemy that you can share with those that you wish to influence , and attack that enemy together .
It ’s frightening how effective this is .
And it ’s so sad to see how hard it is for many of us to build ourselves up , without tearing other people down .
When marketers use this idea to influence or manipulate their customers , they do n’t typically demonize groups of people .
Instead they talk about the forces or limitations that get in our way and stop us from getting what we want .
And they promise to help us attack those obstacles .
Of course , they want to sell us the perfect product .
Some products are wonderful , and can truly help us .
And marketers rightfully speak of common difficulties / enemies that we share .
Other products are useless , and the marketers are only manipulating us .
We ’re used to thinking of unscrupulous salesmen as the most manipulative people on earth , but even the worst salesmen do n’t spend their time teaching us to hate .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney , with a history of heart problems , was found to have an irregular heartbeat during a doctor ’s visit on Monday and went to hospital for more evaluation , his office said .
Tests determined Cheney , 66 , one of President George W. Bush ’s closest advisers , had “ atrial fibrillation , an abnormal rhythm involving the upper chambers of the heart , ” said Megan Mitchell , his spokeswoman .
Cheney , who had gone to see his doctors because of a lingering cough from a cold , went to the hospital for further evaluation and , if required , will have an electric impulse to the heart delivered , a standard treatment , Mitchell said .
He would be sedated for the outpatient procedure and would be expected to return home on Monday night , she said .
Atrial fibrillation is a disorder becoming increasingly common .
The heart ’s two small upper chambers quiver instead of beating effectively and blood is not pumped completely out , so it may pool and clot , putting the person at risk of stroke .
Cheney survived four heart attacks before he became vice president .
The last one , shortly after the November 2000 election , was considered mild .
More recently he was treated for a blood clot in his leg that was discovered after a trip to Asia and the Middle East .
He had his internal heart - regulating device , an implanted cardioverter defibrillator , replaced in July .
The devices monitor the heart and shock it back into a normal rhythm if abnormal beating occurs .
Cheney also had surgery to treat abnormal blood vessels , or aneurysms , behind both knees in September 2005 .

As a chief weapons inspector for the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq , Scott Ritter was labeled a hero by some , a maverick by others , and a spy by the Iraqi government .
In charge of searching out weapons of mass destruction within Iraq , Ritter was on the front lines of the ongoing battle against arms proliferation .
His experience in Iraq served as the basis for his book Endgame , which explored the shortcomings of American foreign policy in the Persian Gulf region and alternative approaches to handling the Iraqi crisis , and for Iraq Confidential , which detailed his seven year experience as a weapons inspector .
Scott Ritter has had an extensive and distinguished career in government service .
He is an intelligence specialist with a 12 - year career in the U.S. Marine Corps including assignments in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East .
Rising to the rank of Major , Ritter spent several months of the Gulf War serving under General Norman Schwarzkopf with US Central Command headquarters in Saudi Arabia , where he played an instrumental role in formulating and implementing combat operations targeting Iraqi mobile missile launchers which threatened Israel .
In 1991 , Ritter joined the United Nations weapons inspections team , or UNSCOM .
He participated in 34 inspection missions , 14 of them as chief inspector .
Ritter resigned from UNSCOM in August 1998 , citing US interference in the work of the inspections .
He is the author of many books , including â€ œIraq Confidential : The Untold Story of the Intelligence Conspiracy to Undermine the UN and Overthrow Saddam Husseinâ€  and most recently â€ œTarget Iran : The Truth About the White Houseâ€™s Plans for Regime Change.â€ 
He lives in New York State .
Ritter was born in Florida , and raised all over the world in a career military family .
He is a graduate of Franklin and Marshall College , with a B.A. in Soviet History .
A divided federal appeals court today dismissed a case challenging the National Security Agency ’s program to wiretap without warrants the international communications of some Americans , reversing a trial judge ’s order that the program be shut down .
The majority in a three - judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , in Cincinnati , ruled on a narrow ground , saying the plaintiffs , including lawyers and journalists , could not show injury direct and concrete enough to allow them to have standing to sue .
Because it is extremely difficult to show concrete injury from the highly classified program , the effect of the ruling was to insulate the program from judicial scrutiny in ordinary federal courts .
The majority did not rule on the merits of the case , though the appeals judge who wrote the lead opinion , Alice M. Batchelder , said the case provoked “ a cascade of serious questions . ”
Those questions included whether the program violated a 1978 law , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , along with the Constitution ’s First and Fourth Amendments .

Memory - prompting abilities of brain stimulation discovered by accident .
An electrode implanted in the brain can help with Parkinson's ... and maybe Alzheimer's .
Alison Abbott / Nature
Electrodes implanted into the brain of a patient undergoing an experimental treatment for obesity have surprisingly improved his memory skills .
The startling and unexpected effects — reported in Annals of Neurology1 — have prompted the Canadian team of neurologists to launch a new deep - brain stimulation ( DBS ) trial in patients with early Alzheimer ’s disease .
Three patients have already had electrodes implanted , says neurosurgeon Andres Lozano from the University of Toronto 's Toronto Western Research Institute .
“ The surgery seems safe and the results are promising , ” he says .
During DBS , a hair - thin electrode with four contact points is placed in a very precise area of the brain .
Each contact can be stimulated individually with different frequencies of electric current — or switched off — by remote control .
The tiny currents are intended to activate specific neural circuits in the brain that under - perform in particular disorders .
The procedure is most often used to treat Parkinson ’s disease but , in the past few years , neurosurgeons have been experimenting with treating psychiatric disorders including depression and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
The 50 - year old patient described in the paper was the first to have DBS for obesity , in 2003 .
At around 190 kilograms his weight was life - threatening , and he had not responded to other forms of therapy .
The surgeons chose to place the electrode in the hypothalamus , a small almond - sized area of the brain just above its base , because stimulating this area of the brain in animals can affect the amount of food they want to eat .
In the past , neurosurgeons have tried to treat obesity by removing part of the hypothalamus .
Déjà vu
Lozano was surprised when the patient announced , during test brain stimulations in the operating theatre , that he was feeling a profound sense of déjà vu .
The patient recalled what he considered to be a pleasant memory : a scene in a park with friends from about 30 years ago .
The more intense the current , the more details of the scene he could fill in .
Prompting a memory from brain stimulation is not uncommon , but the researchers were intrigued that this happened from an electrode in the hypothalamus .
In a battery of neuropsychological tests performed before and after the surgery , the research team found that the patient 's general mental performance remained basically unchanged .
But his performance in complex memory tests involving interpreting and remembering pairs of words was dramatically improved when the electrodes were switched on .
The tests were designed so that neither the patient nor the experimenter knew whether the brain was being stimulated during the test .
This specific type of memory improvement is thought to be linked to an area of the brain called the hippocampus .
When the researchers looked at the patient ’s brain using electroencephalography , they found that electric stimulation activated areas around the hippocampus .
They team propose that the electrodes must inadvertently stimulate a bundle of neurons known as the fornix , which passes through the hypothalamus en route to the hippocampus .
Window into the brain
“ The hypothalamus is a crowded place in terms of functions , with lots of things going on , ” says Lozano .
“ That ’s why we test the effect of stimulating each of the contact points in turn in the operating theatre — if something untoward happens , then we can just switch them off again . ”
But the unanticipated side - effect on memory is a positive one .
Although this is a only a single - patient study , Lozano says that the implications are very important .
“ For the first time we have a window into the neural circuitry of memory in humans — about which very little is known — that we can both access and modify . ”
In March 2007 Lozano began a pilot study to investigate whether such stimulation could help to improve the failing memories of Alzheimer ’s patients , before their disease is so far advanced that their neural circuits have been destroyed .
If the procedure proves safe in six patients , he will start an larger international study to look at efficacy .
ADVERTISEMENT
Unexpected discussion
“ It is very exciting , and it has never been done before , ” says Richard Henson , an expert on human memory at the University of Cambridge , UK .
“ It is one of those rare cases when it is necessary for medical reasons to stimulate the hypothalamus , and it is telling us something about the neural circuitry involved in learning . ”
“ It ’s an interesting example of the sort of unexpected finding we may start to see as different brain areas are tested with DBS , ” says Helen Mayberg , a neurologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia .
“ It suggests that enhanced brain functioning — and not just reversal of abnormal behaviour — is possible with DBS , and that ’s going to prompt a lot of discussion among scientists and ethicists . ”
Whether the DBS procedure will prove helpful in obesity , as originally anticipated , is less clear .
The patient does find his appetite is suppressed when the electrodes are switched on , but he has not lost weight as he tends to switch them off when he wants to eat .
I scoured the Internet tubes for an entire day just to assemble this collection of fantastic billboards .
They are from all over the place , and it was n’t until after I assembled them that I realized I did n’t keep track of where most originated ( if anyone knew in the first place ) .
So sorry about that .
Anyway , for Thursday the 13th here is a crop of 13 freshly prepared humorous , cool and witty billboards .
( Hmmm … Humorous .
Cool .
Witty .
Remind you of anyone ? )
So , enjoy the fruits of my cheap Greek - American labor .
Oh , and Warning : This article is Not kid safe !
Damn this was an expensive billboard .
But I guess it ’s worth it if people stop to pose for photos by it .
Ouch .
This billboard comes with biting satire at no extra charge .
I do n’t know if this is real , but it is hilarious !
Would you like a side of irony with that order ?
I do n’t want to be the guy that had to install this billboard .

Edit 9/13 : Here are a couple more sent over by Johny
Something is definitely rotten down on the farm .
The General Accounting Office , Congress  fact - finding agency , released in mid-June a study of the U.S. Department of Agricultures management of the farm - subsidy program , a multibillion - dollar system of direct payments to farmers .
The findings should horrify lawmakers but probably wont .
The GAO revealed that government employees are ill - trained and federal laws too vague to properly monitor the hundreds of thousands of farm - subsidy payments granted each year .
The GAO found many of the approved recipients were ineligible for subsidies .
( The USDA fact - checks only about 1,000 applications each year . )
A GAO sample of USDA - reviewed and approved subsidies revealed that 30 percent of even these scrutinized farm subsidies were going to people who shouldnt be receiving them .
The lack of USDA oversight is outrageous , given how much America spends on subsidies .
From 1995 to 2002 the U.S. taxpayer doled out more than $ 114 billion to farmers , and in 2002 President Bush upped subsidies to $ 190 billion over the next 10 years .
For perspective , consider that in the year 2000 alone , U.S. spending on farm subsidies exceeded the gross domestic product of more than 70 nations , based on federal government figures .
With so much money being freely handed out , the GAO report should lead to some tough questions for USDA officials on Capitol Hill .
Yet , for all its detail , the 75 - page report artfully avoids the bigger question that no lawmaker wants to hear :
Why do we even have farm subsidies ?
One popular misconception that contributes to support for farm subsidies is that because they result in lower food prices , they are a boon to consumers .
This ignores the fact that taxes pay for these subsidies .
Any reduction in supermarket prices is paid for by your taxes , or someone elses , whether you buy that ear of corn or not .
Farm subsidies are not intended to reduce the cost of food significantly .
If prices fell too much , farmers would lose money .
To prevent this , Congress also has environmental  conservation subsidies that pay farmers not to cultivate their land , resulting in higher prices for crops that are thus made scarcer .
Consequently , from 1995 through 2002 we paid $ 14 billion for farmland conservation subsidies that increased the price of our food .
Another myth is that farm subsidies can help U.S. exports , and therefore the U.S. economy , because they make our food cheaper for foreigners to buy .
This claim ignores at least two realities .
First , just as farm subsidies are a wealth transfer from some taxpayers to some domestic consumers , so they are a wealth transfer to foreign consumers .
Second , farm subsidies are starting to cost U.S. exporters .
Last April , the World Trade Organization ruled that U.S. cotton subsidies violated global trade rules , which could lead to billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs or fines .
The ruling will encourage developing countries to bring lawsuits against other subsidized U.S. exports .
If the United States were to stop subsidizing agriculture , it could encourage others to do the same .
Franz Fischler , the European Unions agriculture commissioner , announced at the Doha Round of international trade negotiations in May that ,  Provided we get a balanced deal , we are ready to put all of [ Europes ] export subsidies on the table . 
Given that European agricultural subsidies are almost six times greater per land unit than U.S. subsidies , American exporters would gain tremendously from an end to subsidies .
Farmers in the developing world , who struggle in the face of unfair competition from crops subsidized by governments of the developed world , would also gain .
The most enduring political illusion is that farm subsidies are necessary to maintain the small family farmer .
In fact , 77 percent of Americans support giving subsidies to small family farms , according to a 2004 poll by the PIPA / Knowledge Network .
Small family farmers are not the primary dollar recipients of federal subsidies , however .
According to the subsidy watchdog , Environmental Working Group , 71 percent of farm subsidies go to the top 10 percent of subsidy beneficiaries , almost all of which are large farms .
In 2002 , 78 farms , none small or struggling , each received more than a million dollars in subsidies .
The bottom 80 percent of recipients average only $ 846 per year .
The result of subsidizing the rich , more landed farmers is that they can reduce the prices of their goods , making it much harder for small farmers to compete .
Rather than being the small family farmers  savior , subsidies work against them .
Rich farmers are a powerful lobby in American politics .
In the last election , crop producers gave $ 11.5 million in campaign contributions , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , and they are likely to give much more by this November .
So dont be surprised that the GAOs report wont be taken too seriously on Capitol Hill .
Farm subsidies are more than just payoffs for loaded , large landowners .
They re subsidies for elected officials , too .
Female rhesus monkeys use special vocalizations while interacting with infants , the way human adults use motherese , or “ baby talk , ” to engage babies ’ attention , new research at the University of Chicago shows .
“ Motherese is a high pitched and musical form of speech , which may be biological in origin , ” said Dario Maestripieri , Associate Professor in Comparative Human Development at the University .
“ The acoustic structure of particular monkey vocalizations called girneys may be adaptively designed to attract young infants and engage their attention , similar to how the acoustic structure of human motherese , or baby talk , allows adults to visually or socially engage with infants . ”
In order to determine if other primates also use special vocalizations while interacting with infants , researchers studied a group of free - ranging rhesus macaques , which live on an island off the coast of Puerto Rico .
They studied the vocalizations exchanged between adult females and found that grunts and girneys increased dramatically when a baby was present .
They also found that when a baby wandered away from its mother , the other females looked at the baby and vocalized , suggesting that the call was intended for the baby .
“ Adult females become highly aroused while observing the infants of other group members , ” explains lead author of the article , Jessica Whitham , a recent Ph.D. graduate of the University of Chicago , who investigated this topic as a doctoral student at the University and currently works at Brookfield Zoo near Chicago .
“ While intently watching infants , females excitedly wag their tails and emit long strings of grunts and girneys .
“ The calls appear to be used to elicit infants ’ attention and encourage their behavior .
They also have the effect of increasing social tolerance in the mother and facilitating the interactions between females with babies in general .
Thus , the attraction to other females ’ infants results in a relatively relaxed context of interaction where the main focus of attention is the baby , ” Maestripieri and his colleagues write in the article , “ Intended Receivers and Functional Significance of Grunt and Girney Vocalizations in Free - Ranging Rhesus Macaques ” published in the current issue of the journal Ethology .
In addition to Whitham and Maestripieri , Dr. Melissa Gerald , a researcher at the University of Puerto Rico , was also a co-author .
Researchers have long been interested in the noises that non-human primates make and how they are used for communication .
Monkey vocalizations could be carrying information that the sender expects the recipient to understand , or they could be noises that the recipient can draw inferences from , but are not intended to carry information .
A human sneeze , for instance , is a noise that people understand may be associated with a cold , but it did not develop evolutionarily to convey information .
The study by Maestripieri ’s team showed that the grunts and girneys emitted by the rhesus macaques fall into the category of vocalizations not intended to convey specific information , and appear to be used to attract other individuals ’ attention or change their emotional states .
When females vocalize to young infants , however , the infants ’ mothers infer that the females simply want to play with the infants and are unlikely to harm them .
Therefore , these vocalizations may facilitate adult females ’ interactions not only with infants , but with the infants ’ mothers as well .
They found , for instance , that the grunts and girneys were sometimes followed by an approach and grooming of the mothers .
Additionally they discovered that , unlike human mothers , the rhesus macaque mothers did not direct grunts or girneys toward their own offspring .
It could be that the monkey mothers are familiar with their own offspring and use the vocalizations with other babies because they are excited about the novelty of seeing a new infant , Maestripieri said .

" Mindin ’ other people ’s business seems to be high - toned I got all that I can do just to mind my own

Despite being as prevalent as cockroaches and having a known penchant for gibber and gab , the mindset of your average statist is not easy to determine .
I recall once summarizing for a coworker some of the exceptional arguments contained in Peter McWilliams 's Ain’t Nobody ’s Business if You Do : The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in a Free Society .
My resuscitation made no impression upon her .
She listened with irritation and when I was done quipped , " Well , if we do n't keep fighting the drug war then we 'll have a nation full of addicts .
We 'd all sit around doing drugs all day . "
While logically challenged , statists are transcendent in contemporary America .
They have succeeded in altering society to an appalling extent via a Byzantine avalanche of laws and credos .
Their state - sponsored vice suppresses freedom under the auspices of enhancing public safety .
These saintly persons actually believe that each regulation , and each thought they have , saves lives .
There is little mystery behind their methods .
The first thing they do is find a problem — which , in all likelihood , was never a problem — and then emotionalize it until the press takes notice .
From there it ’s cream cheese for activists because our nation 's slanted journalists and politicians are only too happy to extinguish liberty on their behalf .
When questioned , statists usually cite the callousness of their critics as a means of rejoinder .
They also contend that the problem ( trans fats , smoking , obesity , drinking , pet refuse , green eggs and ham , etc. ) is so urgent that we no longer have time for debate .
They bellow , " A consensus has been reached .
Off !
Off we must go to the state house to enact legislation which shows we care . "
Indeed , the act of arguing with them allegedly prevents them from " saving lives . "
They then brand their foes as contributors to the problem because , as every half - wit who still holds the 1960s dear fully comprehends , if you 're not part of the solution then you 're part of the problem .
Such a weltanschauung has given rise to a plethora of useless government agencies which exacerbate the very same social conditions they were empowered to combat .
The Leviathan 's aggrandizement currently sucks up 36 percent of our GDP and is a major reason why the dollar 's worth has plummeted as fast as President Bush 's approval rating .
At this point , whenever I hear the words " there ought to be a law " I reach for my keyboard .
If one had any delusions about the effects of the new paternalism on the American people and our way of life they would find them dispelled after devouring David Harsanyi's crafty and engaging , Nanny State : How Food Fascists , Teetotaling Do-Gooders , Priggish Moralists , and other Boneheaded Bureaucrats are Turning America into a Nation of Children .
Of course , the book does not tell the story in its entirety but it certainly shares as many lowlights as one can comfortably digest in a given six - hour period .
The specifics of our " low - grade , feel - good tyranny " consistently horrify .
Shortly after the namby - pamby phrase " something needs to be done " is publicly uttered , all manner of faux sensitive acts of negligence and oppression are then committed .
As readers may imagine , the central tenet of the nanny state is not " live free or die " because freedom is anathema to its structure with its subsequent loss never a cause for concern .
Leaving people to their own druthers is deemed anti-progressive by our modern Committees of Public Safety whose legislators regard the average citizen to be no more than a child .
We are in need of leadership and the direction must come from government bureaucrats — the least knowledgeable , creative , and wise persons in our society .
Harsanyi compellingly depicts the invasive and arbitrary nature of this new dispensation .
As has always been the case , if one wants to better the common man the worst way to go about doing so is to get government involved in the process .
Regulators and enforcement officers " save " practically no one , but are astonishingly effective at producing false positives , false negatives , and atrocious errors of judgment .
This is to be expected as bureaucrats excel at incompetence .
Yesterday saturated fats were a great evil but now they are a godsend because the trans fats are the lipids we must now avoid .
Nannyists look upon our daily wares and see much to crusade against .
Their obsessive eyes fix upon bunk beds , playground equipment , upholstered furniture , pellet guns , bath seats , and water filled yo - yos .
Instinctively they sense that someone somewhere is not safe .
The response is to ban or regulate the offending items .
A warning placed upon a small rack used for the storage of CDs is a testament to their accomplishment .
It guides us to not use it " as a ladder . "
The Leviathan 's decades - long legal stance on drinking and driving reads as if it were an excerpt from a Jackie Mason performance :
Yes , we absolutely know that a .15 blood alcohol level is the main determinant of being drunk .
Of that we can be absolutely certain .
There could be no questioning of it …except for when it became politically expedient to lower it to the .10 level .
That was something we had to do .
We were wrong before but now we 're right .
Trust us because we 're in the business of saving people .
We had to lower it .
With the new decimal marker we are now 100 percent certain that we have identified who really is drunk at the wheel … until the MADD lobbyists convinced us otherwise .
Now we know the error of our ways .
The .08 blood level is correct and what should have been in place all along .
We were wrong before but .08 is something you can cite , quote , and celebrate forever unless …
It would be hysterical were people not being sent to jail for such idiocy .
Drinking while driving used to be the primary alcohol related behavior that nanny staters wanted to micromanage but that is not the case anymore .
A war has been declared on drinking in general .
In Washington DC , the police enacted a policy of a zero tolerance towards drinking and driving , but made a point of not telling anyone about it .
That was a good move on their part because , even within the confines of that particular urban nightmare , the general populace would have undoubtedly regarded as lunacy the notion that having a minute amount of alcohol in your system was a crime .
South Dakota recently attempted to make it a felony for a pregnant woman to order a drink , but the measure failed to pass .
Yet in Wisconsin alcohol has been classified as a date rape drug so having sex with someone under the influence means that they were by definition incapable of giving consent .
Dissatisfied persons can go to the authorities and the unlucky partner ( read : the man ) could awake the next morning to discover that he faces charges of second - degree sexual assault .
A New Mexico representative has even tried to pass a bill mandating every car to be affixed with an ignition interlock — regardless of whether the driver has ever had a drink or not .
It too was voted down , but similar statutes are being proposed in other states .
A MADD advertisement had the audacity to claim that there is no difference between spirits and heroin .
Such a claim is risible as no study ever found that a positive relationship existed between longevity and the daily ingestion of burgundy opiates .
Today , even drinking in the privacy of a bar is under attack .
In suburban Dallas and Herndon , Virginia police sting operations targeted tavern patrons on the basis of their appearing soused .
One of the determinants for who was in need of juridical remediation was the number of times they visited the bathroom .
Harsanyi does not mention whether or not the traveling inquisition went over to Starbucks as the same tactics applied there would have trapped an even larger horde of lawful criminals - in - waiting .
Turning normal people into felons is the eventual result when politicians believe that the purpose of government is to perfect the lives of the populace .
From there it is just a small irrational leap into accepting that every act of paternalism is a good in itself .
Tobacco is a substance for which practically no one has an encouraging word .
Despite cigarette usage declining significantly in America since the sixties the campaign against it continues and illustrates the perfectionists ' lack of nuance along with their zero threshold approach to problem solving .
Condemning smoking was not enough of an intervention so a war had to be waged upon second - hand smoke as well .
Their reasoning was obvious .
They presupposed that if lighting up was bad then it spelled death for those around you .
Except that it does n't .
Science has not validated such a hypothesis .
The variables that confound the effects of secondhand smoke are profuse .
Equating the health risks of being in the vicinity of a smoker with actually smoking is a specious proposition .
A former director of the Centers for Disease Control concluded that " Free will is not within the power of most smokers . "
Is this accurate ?
Nope .
Your weak - willed reviewer quit of his own volition on July 1st 1996 as have millions of my fellow Americans .
No wizardry or bureaucratic dictates were involved in our choices .
This eventuality does not sit well with statists , however , as they revile the idea that humans are capable of independent thought .
A t-shirt Harsanyi once encountered reveals great insight concerning this subject : " smoking is healthier than fascism . "
Amen .
The fusion of PC and nannyism is both predictable and hilarious .
Take Disney 's plot to supersede the character of Christopher Robin on My Friends Tigger & Pooh .
They decided to replace him gradually with a six - year - old girl named Darby .
Not surprising in the current environment as there 's no equivocating about joyful Robin being a white male .
Yet what made the affirmative action move particularly ludicrous was that the producers outfitted Darby with a safety helmet to wear on the new show .
One envisions their executives bantering about the matter beforehand : " Yes !
Yes !
This is perfect !
She 's a girl , but , unlike the boys … she 's safe !
A condom around her bike 's handlebar ?
… Hmm , interesting and tantalizing … but it wo n't go over right now in Jesusland .
Let 's wait until next season to introduce that angle .
But this Darby is going to save the series !
Pooh will be a good old boys ' club no longer .
Darby 's smarter , sleeker , more sensitive , and powerful .
Why she 's practically a grandma on wheels .
A vibrant young lady on a skateboard will sell to soccer moms like Tiffany jewelry ! "
Not all of it is funny though .
Harsanyi asserts that " there is no way to legislate the kid out of kids " but I 'm not so sure .
The jackboot of the state can deaden a child 's spirit and stultify his imagination which is something that nanny staters have been highly effective at doing .
Some Ohio municipalities even require the acquisition of a Halloween license before kids can go out trick - or - treating .
We also find that dodgeball is going the way of the highball .
What was once known as rough and tumble play has become a red flag indicating anti-social inclinations .
Wrestling and tackling are equated with bullying , victimization , and mindless aggression .
That sports are a prosocial means by which humans channel their aggression is something lost on many a contemporary educator .
A member of my own organization was quoted in the book .
The luminary claimed that tag was harmful to children because [ you guessed it ] the game occasionally can be a conduit for bullying and victimization .
I wonder what the representatives of my profession would make of the rollicking playground diversion the lads and I engaged in during the late seventies called " Smear the Queer ? "
Well , they 'd make short work of it .
No doubt that pupil participation would be followed by accusations of homophobia , sensitivity training , and ten days of external suspension .
I guess it has to be this way as teachers instinctively want to mold pupils in their own image .
This means , based on the demographics of today 's public schools , that tykes should strive to become rigidly conformist females in the throes of varying stages of obesity who regard physical activity with the same disdain they would have for the collected works of Friedrich von Hayek .
In such an environment intellectual curiosity is not recommended and largely superfluous .
Modern students are advised to define the truth in trendy and non-accurate ways .
Chicago sage Oprah Winfrey reconstituted truth in a fashion which undoubtedly appeals to many teachers .
She defined veritas as " that which feels right and good and loving . "
Following this " rubric " necessitates our personal emotional experiences becoming the outer and innermost reaches of the world .
Thus , what we know is all we ever will need to know .
What can we do about the nanny stater ?
Not much unfortunately .
Intellectually , they are vapid bantamweights but politically they remain omnipotent cruiserweights .
These folks are motivated chiefly by the need to display contrived moral superiority and a sick need to control others .
Despite their claims , promoting the health of the populace is pretty far down on their list of priorities .
Domination alone is what titillates them .
Their dictatorial efforts will not halt until we all become safe and free to lead lives unworthy of living .

The Best of Bernard Chapin
The Fed on slashed a key interest rate by a hefty three - quarters of a percentage point , the biggest cut in more than 23 years , after a two - day global stocks rout sparked by fears of a U.S. recession .
The move , a rare one made between the U.S. central bank 's regularly scheduled meetings , took the federal funds rate governing overnight lending between banks down to 3.5 percent , its lowest level since September 2005 .
The Fed also lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks to 4 percent .

" The Fed is very , very , very worried , " said John Tierney , an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York .
The Fed 's bold bid failed to instill confidence in shaken financial markets as U.S. stocks , playing catch - up with sell - offs around the world , fell sharply at the open .
But stocks trimmed most of their lossesto close with relatively minor declines .
Prices for U.S. government bonds slipped , while the dollar fell sharply against the euro .
" The committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth , " the Fed said , referring to its policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee .
" While strains in short - term funding markets have eased somewhat , broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households , " it said .

There seems to be a recent outcry about the fact that gaming companies ( such as Nintendo ) have been reaching out to the so - called “ Alpha Mom ” when it comes to gaming .
Especially with the Wii . Oh ?
And your point would be what ?
I have to be honest when I say I am so over the “ we are hard core gamers and they should focus on making games for us ” attitude .
Over .
It . I have heard and read accounts of gamers who get seriously pissed off about the fact there are games created that are not “ hardcore ” but are being marketed to the maternal set .
Cry me a river , boys .
Your whining pisses me off !
Do I have a Wii ?
Yes .
Do I have a DS ?
Yes .
Do I have every game console ( except PS3 ) ?
Yes .
More importantly , do I play them ?
YES .
Do I play MMORPGs ?
Yes .
And I am * gasp * a Mom .
Can you handle that truth ?
But let ’s get back to the real reason I am fired up .
If I hear one more complaint or whine about companies that are looking to lure in / market to / reach out to the “ alpha moms ” , I just may have to open up a huge can of whoop ass on someone .
It is a simple concept .
They show us the fun games .
The games that will appeal to an entire family .
They know ( because they are smart and not caught up in whining about “ hardcore ” vs “ casual ” gaming ) that if they can get Mom in on the gaming , they have won a huge battle .
So what if you , Mr. Hardcore Serious Gamer Dude , is not a fan of games such as Wii Boogie .
Easy solution .
Do n’t play it .
I happen to have it , love it and play it with my entire family .
So why should game developers and companies look to demographics such as the alpha - mom set ?
( Besides the fact that we are the ones who make the majority of the household purchases ? )
Well , since I enjoy it , I share that fun with friends .
They in turn buy the console and the game and the cycle continues .
Honey , that ’s not ignoring the gamers that came before us .
That is creating an entire new generation of gamers .
Plus , if they sell these games to us “ casual gamers ” do n’t you think that will equal profit , which leads to the ability to create more games which will get you , Mr. Hardcore Serious Gamer Dude , more of the types of games you want .
And yes , I know that the first person shooter games are popular .
You think I ca n’t whip someone on those , too ?
I may be able to kick up my heals with games like Wii Sports and Wii Boogie , but I can kick ass with the best of them on Halo .
What so many pissed off “ gamers ” seem to forget is that when they sell games to get the “ Alpha Mom ” and she gets her family involved ( even if these are the “ more casual ” games ) , they are selling them to the generation that is probably going to kick your ass in your “ hardcore game ” within a few years .
You have to learn to walk before you run .
Soon , there will be an entire set of gamers that will be running … right over you in your game .
So let ’s talk MMORPGs .
A while back on my gaming blog I had someone link to me and say that “ I was ruining the integrity of true gaming by calling myself a gamer and playing World of Warcraft . ”
( Yes , I laughed , too . )
I am very thankful to Blizzard for taking a chance on me and hooking me up with WoW .
I was at a point that not only did I not get the appeal , but I was ready to get it out of the house .
They got it .
They realized that if you get the mom , you get the family .
I really do enjoy WoW .
I have fun playing .
And , yes , I can probably whip the crap out of a lot of the whiners on the game because I do n’t worry about whether or not I am a “ real ” gamer or not .
I just play .
Guess what , Mr. Serious Gamer Dude ?
Remember when you were crying a river over the delayed release of Blizzard ’s Burning Crusade ?
Remember that ?
I was alpha testing it .
Then beta testing it .
Now , I am raiding with the best of them on it .
Why ?
Because gaming is not limited to a certain minuscule demographic .
Women play games .
Including the “ hardcore ” games that you seem to feel you have cornered the market on .
Even Moms play them .
Yes , really !
The Newsweek blog Level Up wrote a re-cap of E3 and mentioned this very issue of not meeting the needs of the core gamer .
Elephant in the room :
The unfulfilled needs of the core Nintendo gamer , who ’s becoming as invisible as Snuffleupagus while the company pursues Alpha Moms and active seniors .
The “ needs of the core Nintendo gamer ” ?
Like to have your every gaming need met ?
To have them ensure your gaming whims are taken care of with every release ?
To have your hand held ?
To ensure that a huge company like Nintendo meets only your needs and not those of a huge audience ?
To that I say , put your big girl panties on and get over it .
Casual gamers are here .
To stay .
And we are making the company that you are whining about a huge profit .
Just as every book is not a thriller and every movie is not and action / adventure movie , not every game is going to fall into the “ hardcore ” gaming category .
That is just common sense and good business .
Feeling neglected ?
Feeling like game developers need to listen to what you want and what you need ?
Go cry to your guild and move over .
We want to play .

Taser stun guns are used by police forces in Britain
Specialist firearms officers are to trained in January in the use of the controversial electric stun guns that hit a human target with 50,000 volts .
Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde told members of the Policing Board that a pilot scheme would be set up .
The board said it was unhappy he was going ahead with the move before all relevant public bodies were consulted .
However , the chief constable said that only officers from the specialist operations branch would be trained in the use of tasers and the pilot would " encompass potentially violent situations and pre-planned operations " .
Sir Hugh said the PSNI was the only force in the UK and Ireland not to have tasers and he " has had sleepless nights about officers using firearms when they could have a less lethal option available to them " .
In October , the board voted in favour of a motion that tasers should not be deployed until an equality impact assessment was completed .
Human rights experts who advise the policing board have expressed concern about the use of the stun gun .
Tasers are already in use by police forces in England , Scotland , Wales and the USA .

No sign of aliens after all
FOR a dull lump of greyish rock , ALH 84001 has had an eventful life .
The meteorite , which was retrieved from the Allan Hills of Antarctica in 1984 , is certainly well travelled .
Experts in the field think it came from Mars , having been blasted off the surface of that planet by a collision with an even bigger meteorite .
More than that , it contains minerals that some researchers believed , in a flurry of publicity when the rock was properly examined just over a decade ago , must have been made by living things on the Martian surface .
The number constituting “ some ” has been dwindling since then , but there are still a few hold - outs who think ALH 84001 is indeed the first evidence of extraterrestrial aliens — albeit of bacterial dimensions .
The reason why ALH 84001 is so interesting is that it contains organic compounds .
Life is thought to have emerged on Earth from a primordial soup of such compounds , which are based on carbon , hydrogen and oxygen , though just how it did so is obscure .
When ALH 84001 was analysed , however , some astrobiologists suggested that the conventional explanation might be wrong .
Perhaps life had evolved on Mars first and the red planet had then “ seeded ” its blue neighbour when rocky projectiles similar to ALH 84001 were blasted off its surface in abundance in an era when the solar system had a lot of loose asteroids flying around .
To test these claims , a group of researchers led by Andrew Steele of the Carnegie Institution in Washington , DC , decided to identify precisely what ALH 84001 contains and then compare the results with those from rocks that definitely formed on Earth .
Using a number of different techniques , they discovered that the tiny spheres of carbonate minerals within the meteorite which had caused such a stir were surrounded by an iron - oxide mineral called magnetite .
Some true believers had seen the presence of magnetite in the meteorite as evidence supporting their cause .
That was because certain earthly bacteria make small grains of the mineral , in order to navigate their habitats using the Earth 's magnetic field , much as human navigators once used lodestone compasses made of magnetite to find their way around .
However , most of the magnetite on Earth is not bacterial .
Instead , it was ejected in liquid form from volcanoes .
If this magnetite cools in an environment rich in water and carbon dioxide ( which terrestrial volcanoes usually are ) , it can act as a catalyst for the formation of organic compounds from the carbon , hydrogen and oxygen atoms in those two raw ingredients .
Dr Steele and his colleagues thus decided to compare ALH 84001 with volcanic rocks collected in Svalbard , the northernmost territory of Norway .
These rocks are thought to have formed when volcanoes erupted in freezing , pristine conditions a million years or so ago .
The researchers found that the earthly boulders , too , contained carbonates encircled by magnetite .
Writing in a forthcoming issue of Meteoritics and Planetary Science , they conclude that the organic material in ALH 84001 was made not by Martian microbes but , rather , by chemical reactions within the rock .
Such a conclusion may be disappointing to astrobiologists , who seek to study life on other planets , so far without success .
But it also offers them hope .
If Dr Steele and his colleagues are correct , then volcanic activity in a place other than Earth has produce interesting - looking organic compounds .
That means the building blocks of life could form on cold , rocky volcanic planets throughout the universe .
And the universe is a very big place .
Gravel : Bush should be jailed , all drugs legalized RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 16 , 2007 Print This Email This Former Sen. Mike Gravel , the longshot presidential candidate who has generated buzz in the liberal blogosphere following a dramatic and heated performance during the first Democratic presidential debate , reaffirmed his belief that President Bush should be jailed for going to war in Iraq and that all drugs should be legalized during an interview with the Iowa Independent blog .
Responding to why he seemed to display anger at the debate , Gravel asserted it was the growing casualty list in Iraq that fueled his passion .
" How would you feel if you were over there ( Iraq ) getting shot at , getting crippled , because your leaders didnt exercise proper judgment ? " said Gravel .
" What about the people who are going to die between now and Christmas because we dont end the war ?
That 's a reason to get angry . "
Gravel went on to reaffirm his support for his signature campaign issue , a national initiative process , as well his support for a national sales tax , a traditionally conservative position .
When asked whether he believed marijuana should be available next to beer in liquor stores , Gravel replied , " Go get yourself a fifth of scotch or a fifth of gin and chug - a - lug it down and you 'll find you lose your senses a lot faster than you would smoking some marijuana . "
He asserted that all drugs should legalized and regulated .
" The drug problem is a public health problem .
It 's not a criminal problem .
We make it a criminal problem because we treat people like criminals . "
Gravel continued , " You take a drug addict , you throw him in jail , you leave him there , and he learns the criminal trade so that when he gets out you have recidivism . "
When pressed on his earlier statement that President Bush should be jailed for his manipulation of pre-war information , Gravel reaffirmed that belief .
" If you had an FBI agent knock at your door today and you lie to that agent , you commit a felony and you go to jail , " Gravel said .
" If that 's the way it is for ordinary citizens , what about the president of the United States who lies to the American people , fraudulently sells them on a war that 50 million Americans do n't want and over 3,000 Americans get killed as a result of that , and thousands and thousands of Iraqis gets killed ... do you not think that 's a felony ?
It 's criminal . "

If You Only Had Three Days
Over the weekend I watched a movie called Three Days .
Briefly , the movie was about a couple who had a fight on Christmas Eve , and then the wife was killed in an accident .
An angel visited the husband and gave him three more days with his wife .
He had three days to convince her that he loved her .
And he knew she would die in three days .
What if you knew a loved one would die in three days ?
I know that ’s a depressing thought .
My husband and I were there last year , though .
No , we did n’t know exactly when my father - in - law would pass away .
But we knew his time was short .
And I have to tell you , during that time , money did n’t matter .
Things did n’t matter .
Time mattered .
A lot .
My goal this holiday season is to focus on the people I love , not stuff .
If I knew I only had three days left with a loved one , the number of presents under the tree would n’t matter .
The amount of money I spent on the presents would n’t matter .
Whether our house is perfectly decked out for the holidays would n’t matter .
What matters is the time spent together .
I ’m going to make cookies and candy , and my kids are going to help .
Instead of rushing through the job , we ’re going to enjoy baking together .
And if my cookies do n’t look perfect , so be it .
My kids and I will have a good memory that will last much longer than the cookies .
Twenty years down the line my kids probably wo n’t remember what they received this particular Christmas .
What they will remember is whether our family was happy or whether we bickered a lot .
Whether our holidays were happy , or whether we rushed through them .
This holiday season I encourage you all to think about what ’s important .
If you only had three days left , what would you want your family to remember ?

Iran has described the incident as an " ordinary occurrence "
Iranian footage
There is no sign of threatening behaviour by the Iranian boats , as alleged by US officials who said their actions were dangerous and provocative .
However , the four - minute clip does not appear to show the whole incident in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday .
Iran accuses the US of faking video and audio evidence to support its claims .
" Coalition warship number 73 this is an Iranian patrol , " the Iranian commander is heard to say in clear English in the footage , broadcast on Iran 's English - language Press TV .
" This is coalition warship number 73 .
I am operating in international waters , " comes the reply .
On Tuesday the US military released video and audio it said confirmed its allegation that Iranian speedboats harassed US warships and threatened to blow them up in a radio communication .
Iran described the incident as a routine contact which happens all the time in the crowded waters of the Gulf .
The confrontation has further inflamed tensions between arch - foes Iran and the United States .
US President George W Bush is currently on a tour of the Middle East which will tackle what the Americans see as the threat posed by Iran to regional stability .
Monday night on his show , Billo called White House correspondent Helen Thomas a " pinhead " for saying something she did n't .
Download Download
This was a complete fabrication , aided in no small part by White House spokesperson Dana Perino 's twisting of Helen 's words at the podium .
Notice how O'Reilly purposefully began his clip not with Helen 's question , but with Perino 's response to it :
O'Reilly :
On the pinhead front far left Washington corespondent Helen Thomas put forth that the American military is targeting civilians in Iraq , and got scolded for it .
[ video clip ] Dana Perino :
Helen , I find it really unfortunate that you use your front row position bestowed upon you by your colleagues to make such statements .
This is .
It is an honor and a privilege to be in the briefing room , and to suggest that we , at the United States , are killing innocent people is just absurd and very offensive .
...
Now check out C&L 's complete video w/ transcript of the exchange ( yet another reason why C&L is so much better than any Faux News channel ) to see where both Billo and Perino had to put words into Helen Thomas ' mouth in order to criticize her for saying something she did not .
Helen never said nor implied that the military was " targeting civilians " nor " killing innocent people . "
What she asked was : " You mean how many more people we kill ? " in response to Dana 's implying that the " situation is moving " in Iraq .
See for yourself .
Bill O'Reilly resorted to defaming an 87 yr old woman who was 10 times the journalist he has ever pretended to be 64 yrs ago when she started in the trade , all just so he could call her a " pinhead " in the name calling segment of his show .
Even by Fox News standards this was low .
At the very least Bill O'Reilly owes Helen Thomas an apology and an on air retraction to his viewers .
You can email your complaints [ be nice ] to O'Reilly 's so - called ombudman , Laurie Dhue , at DhuePoint@FOXNews.com .
Here is Henry Farrell on the book .
Here is Matt Yglesias .
Here is Fred Siegel .
Here is Arnold Kling .
Here is another review .
Here is Megan McArdle on the BloggingHeads version .
Here is the Amazon link .
I am closest to the CrookedTimber commentator who wrote :
Jonah ’s book , at its heart , is geared toward popularizing the arguments of smart intellectuals / academics , from John Patrick Diggins to A.J. Gregor to Hayek to Erik Von Kuehnelt - Leddihn .
Or try this excellent book , or for that matter John T. Flynn ’s As We Go Marching .
I divide the arguments of Liberal Fascism into three categories :
1 . The oft neglected but obviously true :
For instance Mussolini really was a precursor of the New Deal and he was initially regarded with fondness by many on the American left .
This sort of claim is the core of the book and it does stand up after you take all the criticisms into account .
I am pleased to see it upend traditional " feel good " narratives of politics .
That said , a " who cares ? " response might be in order from a social democrat .
Good people can have bad ideas , so ca n’t bad people — namely the fascists — have had some good ideas ?
After all , George Lucas borrowed from Leni Riefenstahl .
2 . The false claims : Contrary to what Goldberg argues , it simply is n’t true that Hitler and Nazism were essentially left - wing phenomena .
Not all right - wing ideas are Burkean , and the mere fact that the Nazis were " revolutionary " does not make them left - wing .
Furthermore the Nazis busted labor unions and used right - wing emotive tricks for their racism and authoritarianism .
When all those old Nazis popped up in South America , where did they all find themselves on the political spectrum ?
Overall fascism has much stronger roots in the Right than Goldberg is willing to emphasize .
I also would have put more weight on the aestheticization of politics than did Goldberg .
That would help us see why supporters of the War on Drugs , while they favor very violent and possibly unjust means , should not be regarded as fascists .
3 . The true but possibly misleading claims .
Goldberg writes for instance that Hillary Clinton is not a fascist .
OK , but simply to write that she is n’t a fascist is reframing the terms of the debate , and not in a way I am fully comfortable with .
I ’m sure it bothers many Clinton supporters more than it bothers me .
Goldberg insists he only wants to stop the slander of the Right and its long - standing identification with fascism .
I am fully behind this goal of tolerance , and I might add I recall fellow Harvard econ grad students calling Martin Feldstein ( and perhaps me ! ) a fascist on a regular basis .
That simply should n’t happen .
The problem is that Goldberg ’s book will be interpreted by its buyers and readers as a call to do the same to the left .
Take a look at the cover and the title , both of which Goldberg distanced himself from on Comedy Central ( I can no longer find the YouTube link ) .
But they ’re on the book nonetheless .
Is Goldberg " to blame " for how his book will be interpreted , especially if he requests an interpretation to the contrary ?
That ’s a moot point .
But it gets to the core of why I do n’t like the book more than I do .
The bottom line : As Arnold Kling recommends , all parties involved should read Dan Klein ’s " The People ’s Romance , " and start the debate there .
Addendum : Some of the critical web reviews admit they have not read the book , but they rely heavily on Goldberg ’s ( apparently controversial ) web writings .
I ’ve never read Goldberg before , so I am coming at this book " fresh . "
Thou shalt not report odds ratios
This is a second in a series of posts aimed at improving the rhetoric ( and logic ) of science journalism .
Last time ( " Two simple numbers " , 7/22/2007 ) , I asked for something positive : stories on " the genetic basis of X " should tell us how frequent the genomic variant is among people with X and among people without X .
This time , I 've got a related , but negative , request .
No , let 's make it a commandment : Thou Shalt Not Report Odds Ratios .
In fact , I 'd like to suggest that any journalist who reports an odds ratio as if it were a relative risk should be fired sent back to school .
Many of you probably do n't know what I 'm talking about -- that 's why dozens of science journalists disobey this commandment every week .
But the basic concepts are simple , and nothing more than simple arithmetic is required to understand them .
Here 's a simple , classic example that illustrates the problem .
A few years ago , some researchers from Georgetown University published in the New England Journal of Medicine a study that demonstrated systematic race and sex bias in the behavior of America 's doctors .
Needless to say , this finding was widely reported in the media :
Washington Post : " Physicians said they would refer blacks and women to heart specialists for cardiac catheterization tests only 60 percent as often as they would prescribe the procedure for white male patients . "
L.A. Times : " [ Doctors ] refer blacks and women to heart specialists 60 % as often as they would white male patients . "
N.Y .
Times : " Doctors are only 60 % as likely to order cardiac catheterization for women and blacks as for men and whites . "
Now let't try a little test of reading comprehension .
The study found that the referral rate for white men was 90.6 % .
What was the referral rate for blacks and women ?
If you 're like most literate and numerate people , you 'll calculate 60 % of 90.6 % , and come up with .6*.906 = .5436 .
So , you 'll reason , the referral rate for blacks and women was about 54.4 % .
But in fact , what the study found was a referral rate for blacks and women of 84.7 % .
What 's going on ?
It 's simple -- the study reported an " odds ratio " .
The journalists , being as ignorant as most people are about odds and odds ratios , reported these numbers as if they were ratios of rates rather than ratios of odds .
Let 's go through the numbers .
If 90.6 % of white males were referred , then 9.4 % were not referred , and so a white male 's odds of being referred were 90.6/9.4 , or about 9.6 to 1 .
Since 84.7 % of blacks and women were referred , 13.3 % were not referred , and so for these folks , the odds of referral were 84.7/15.3 ≅ 5.5 to 1 .
The ratio of odds was thus about 5.5/9.6 , or about 0.6 to 1 .
Convert to a percentage , and you 've got " 60 % as likely " or " 60 per cent as often " .
The ratio of odds ( rounded to the nearest tenth ) was truly 0.6 to 1 .
But when you report this finding by saying that " doctors refer blacks and women to heart specialists 60 % as often as they would white male patients " , normal readers will take " 60 % as often " to describe a ratio of rates -- even though in this case the ratio of rates ( the " relative risk " ) was 84.7/90.6 , or ( in percentage terms ) about 93.5 % .
( There was another set of rhetorical problems with the reporting of this particular study , one that was created by the study 's authors .
In fact the referral rates for white males , black males and white females were apparently pretty much all the same -- the crucial part of the pattern was that the referral rate for black females was much lower , namely around 78.8 % .
The 90.6 % vs. 84.7 % figures were created by comparing the white male data against aggregated data for white females and blacks of both sexes .
But I digress . )
My discussion of this case is drawn from an article published subsequently in the same journal : Lisa Schwartz et al. , " Misunderstandings about the Effects of Race and Sex on Physicians ' Referrals for Cardiac Catheterization " , NEJM 341:279-283 , July 22 , 1999 .
The problem was well understood by statistically well - informed people long before then , and was explicitly discussed in an earlier study in the British Medical Journal : H. T. O. Davies et al. , " When can odds ratios mislead ? " BMJ 316:989-991 ( 1998 ) .
OK , so this is a long - standing and well understood problem , which led to some spectacularly botched ( and prominently excoriated ) presentations of important results back around 1999 .
Surely all competent science journalists understand this now , and have mended their ways ?
Guess again .
Find any piece of reporting that talks about " raising the risk of X by Y % " , or any of the many other ways of putting this same concept into English , and the chances are that you 've found a violation of this commandment .
Let me give two recent examples , among thousands lurking in the past month 's news archive .
According to Steve Connor , " Childhood asthma gene identified by scientists " , The Independent , 7/5/2007
A gene that significantly increases the risk of asthma in children has been discovered by scientists who described it as the strongest link yet in the search to find a genetic basis for the condition .
Inheriting the gene raises the risk of developing asthma by between 60 and 70 per cent - enough for researchers to believe that the discovery may eventually open the way to new treatments for the condition .
[ emphasis added ]
The study in question ( I believe -- the article does n't give any specific reference , as usual for the genre of science journalism ) is Miriam F. Moffatt et al. , " Genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression contribute to the risk of childhood asthma " , Nature 448 , 470-473 ( 26 July 2007 ) .
This is another big genome - wide association study -- roughly 300,000 single - nucleotide polymorphisms were scanned in several populations in the UK and in Germany .
In this case , general information about allele frequencies is not provided ( and perhaps was not available ) .
However , this information is given in one crucial case :
In the subset of individuals for whom expression data are available , the T nucleotide allele at rs7216389 ( the marker most strongly associated with disease in the combined GWA analysis ) has a frequency of 62 % amongst asthmatics compared to 52 % in non-asthmatics ( P = 0.005 in this sample ) .
Now , how can 62 % vs. 52 % be interpreted as " [ raising ] the risk of developing asthma by between 60 and 70 per cent " ?
I mean , 62 is about 19 % greater than 52 , not 60 - 70 % greater .
If you 're guessing " it 's that old devil the odds ratio " , I 'm sure you 're right .
If you 're good at mental arithmetic , you may be worried that even the odds ratio does n't quite make it to 1.6 or 1.7 in this case : ( .62/.38 )/(.52/.48 ) ≅ 1.51 .
We can't tell what Steve Connor was really talking about when he wrote that " inheriting the gene raises the risk of developing asthma by 60 to 70 per cent " , but one possibility is that he ( or his informant ) cherry - picked some even better odds ratios , not from the " combined GWA analysis " ( where GWA stands for " genome - wide association " ) , but some one of the data subsets , perhaps this one :
Restricting analyses to cohort members of Caucasian ethnicity , we found that the 398 cases recalling ' asthma ever ' at age 42 , showed a significant association ( odds ratio , 1.21 , 95 % confidence interval , 1.04 - 1.40 , P = 0.012 ) .
Ninety - three individuals were reported to have ' asthma attacks ' in the first seven years of life ( that is during 1958 to 1965 ) , and these were strongly associated to rs3894194 ( odds ratio = 1.68 , 95 % confidence interval , 1.25 - 2.26 , P = 0.0005 ) .
[ emphasis added ]
With a bit of arithmetic , you can work out for yourself what that 1.68 odds ratio would correspond to in terms of allele frequencies .
Another possibility is that the odds ratio was inferred from the coefficient in a logistic regression , where many factors ( in this case the presence or absence of many SNPs ) are weighed together in a single statistical model .
See below for a bit more discussion ; but it remains true that describing an odds ratio inferred by such a model as if it were a risk ratio ( i.e. a ratio of rates ) is highly misleading .
Now , Steve Connor is not a sports columnist trying his hand at a science piece .
( That 's a plausible excuse for Denis Campbell 's disastrously botched autism / MMR story in the Observer , memorably vivisected by Ben Goldacre in many Bad Science posts and a BMJ article . )
Connor is listed as the " Science Editor " of the Independent , and he ought to know better .
And O'Connor is not the only " Science Editor " for a major publication who has violated this same commandment recently .
Mark Henderson , identified as " Science Editor " of the London Times , was the author of " Genetic breakthrough offers MS sufferers hope of new treatment " , 7/29/2007 :
The first genetic advance in multiple sclerosis research in three decades has opened new approaches to treating the neurological disorder , scientists said yesterday .
Research has identified two genetic variants that each raises a person 's risk of developing MS by about 30 per cent , shedding new light on the origins of the autoimmune disease that could ultimately lead to better therapies .
[ emphasis added ]
The scientific publication in question ( well , there are several of them , but this one will do ) is " Risk Alleles for Multiple Sclerosis Identified by a Genomewide Study " , NEJM , July 29 2007 .
And the " risk - raising " in question is , needless to say , calculated in terms of odds ratios :
A number of allelic variants had a significant association with multiple sclerosis .
Of these , two SNPs in intron 1 of the IL2RA gene encoding the alpha chain of the interleukin - 2 receptor ( also called CD25 , located at chromosome 10p15 ) are notable : rs12722489 ( P=2.96x10 - 8 ; odds ratio , 1.25 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.16 to 1.36 ) and rs2104286 ( P=2.16x10 - 7 ; odds ratio , 1.19 ; 95 % CI , 1.11 to 1.26 ) ( Figure 4 ) .
How do odds ratios of 1.25 and 1.19 translate to " [ raising ] a person 's risk of developing MS by about 30 per cent " ?
Well , again , I believe there is some cherry - picking of numbers from data subsets going on here ( the odds ratios reported are from multiple logistic regression in all cases ) .
But odds - ratio oddities side , what are the allele frequencies involved ?
This time the scientific article does n't tell us , but we can work it out .
In this study , there was a " Screening Phase " , consisting of 931 Family trios vs. 2431 Control Subjects , and a " Replication Phase " involving 2322 Case Subjects , 609 Family Trios , and 2987 Control Subjects .
The article 's Table 2 gives us the following
SNP rs12722489 has RAF ( " risk allele frequency " ) of .85 , with odds ratio of 1.35 in the screening phase , 1.19 in the replication phase , and 1.25 in the combined data .
SNP rs2104286 has RAF of .75 , with odds ratio 1.26 in the " screening phase " , 1.16 in the " replication phase " , and 1.19 in the combined data .
An odds ratio of 1.25 for the first genomic variant , given a background rate of 85 % , would imply a rate in the MS patients of 87.6 % : ( .876/.124)/(.85/.15 ) ≅ 1.25 .
To get an overall odds ratio of 1.19 for the second variant , given a background rate of 75 % , we 'd need a rate in the MS patients of 78.1 % ( you do the math ... ) .
Here 's what the NEJM authors say about their findings :
These variants are not rare mutations of the type that occur in diseases caused by a defect in a single gene , such as muscular dystrophy or sickle cell anemia .
Rather , they are polymorphic variants that also occur in normal populations .
However , each is more common in patients with multiple sclerosis than in control subjects , and each has a small effect on the risk of the disease .
More specifically , one of these variants occurs in about 85 % of people without MS , and about 87.6 % of people with MS ; the other occurs in 75 % of people without MS , and 78.1 % of people with MS .
( At least , these are the rates reconstructed by the logistic regression model . )
On this basis , we can calculate that the first variant increases someone 's risk of MS by a factor of 87.6/85 ≅ 1.03 , or in ordinary language by 3 % ; for the second variant , it 's 78.1/75 ≅ 1.04 , i.e. by 4 % .
The Science Editor of the London Times describes this situation by telling us that " Research has identified two genetic variants that each raises a person 's risk of developing MS by about 30 per cent " .
With all respect , I submit that this is someone in acute need of further education in basic statistical reasoning and journalistic responsibility .
[ There 's another story to be told about why researchers ( as opposed to journalists ) like to report odds ratios .
The basic answer is that they use logistic regression to model rates , so as to assign responsibility fairly among many factors at once , for example among many SNPs distributed in a partially - correlated way in the sample under study .
This is an appropriate thing to do , in general -- but odds ratios , whether calculated directly from raw frequencies , or inferred from logistic regression coefficients , are NOT risk ratios , and should never be presented as such .
When the relative risk is very low , the odds ratio approaches it asymptotically , but for ratios of risks in the range we 've been talking about , the odds ratio is a massive overestimate , and to present it as if it were a ratio of risks is massively misleading .
If you believe the logistic regression , and you want to tell the public about relative risk as inferred by the regression model rather than as estimated directly from the raw frequencies , it 's straightforward to calculate the ( inferred ) relative risk from the ( inferred ) odds ratio and information about overall rates ( e.g. the " risk allele frequency " ) , as I 've done above .
But my third cup of coffee is getting cold , so further discussion of logistic regression will have to wait for another morning . ]

Why are the Democrats keeping impeachment off the table , in the face of more and more flagrant crimes and violations of the Constitution ?
" Spineless " no longer works , since they have succeeded in getting rid of Rumsfeld , Gonzales and Rove , by way of hearings , subpoenas and various other manuevers .
Bush and Cheney are much weakened , and yet they are still being shielded from accountability .
Before the 2006 elections , we were told that the Democrats were avoiding impeachment because it would lose them votes .
Yet as soon as the results were in , giving the Dems a clear majority in the House ( it only takes a majority to impeach - count the votes ) , Pelosi and Conyers again announced that impeachment is off the table .
Why are they protecting Bush and Cheney ?
Politically , it makes much more sense to expose their crimes and discredit them once and for all .
This is happening anyway , as more and more truth leaks out .
The revelation that Pelosi knew about waterboarding back in 2002 and did not object , gives us a clue .
The Democrats have overtly been complicit in many of the illegal actions of the Bush administration .
They voted to let him invade Iraq , and have not rescinded that decision , continue to fund the occupation , despite the evident disaster of this military adventure .
They have acquiesced to torture , warrantless wiretapping , media consolidation , and many other executive outrages .
They have not formally objected to signing statements that overrule the laws they pass , or insisted on the oversight that the Constitution assigns to them .
Digging deeper , it 's evident that the Bush and Cheney family fortunes , via their corporations Carlyle and Halliburton , have profited enormously from the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
The national treasury has been looted by pirates , and the country is facing bankruptcy .
If the financial transactions of these and related companies were brought to light , how many members of Congress would also be implicated ?
How many succumbed to the blandishments of Abramoff and the K Street gang , and are susceptible to blackmail because they accepted bribes and favors ?
How many would have to retire in disgrace , like Cunningham ?
Darker speculations yet have led many to wonder to what degree the Bush and Cheney crime families have made Mafia - style threats to members of Congress ?
Who killed Paul Wellstone and Dennis Carnahan ?
Who sent anthrax to key Senators right after 9 - 11 , effectively closing down the Senate office buildings for several months ?
How have Bush and Cheney obtained protection against impeachment from a Democratic Congress ?
What bribes or threats have they used ?
A can of worms indeed !
I say , let 's open the can and clean house !
Any member of Congress who is NOT actively working for impeachment has violated the oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution from all enemies , foreign AND DOMESTIC .
They deserve to be replaced .

We need a clean sweep of Congress .
プログラマじゃない人にとってのオープンソースって何だろう？
昨日の件がまだ頭にこびり付いているのでそんなことを考えているのですが。
ソースを読み書きできない人にとって、オープンソースであるかクローズドソースであるかなんて、何の違いもないのじゃないのかな？なぜなら、ソースを読み書きできないなら、たとえオープンソースでもソースにアクセスできないのだから。
であるならば、意志決定に影響するのは「機能」と「値段」しかないのではないのでしょうか？ここでは、サポートに関する部分も「機能」と「値段」に含めてしまっています。
その観点に立てば、オープンソースの強みは結局「値段」の意味で「フリー」であることだよなーと。
特にビジネスの観点からすれば、自前でソフトウェアの開発力を持たなくても、オープンソースのソフトウェアを使うことでビジネスを始めることができるということは大きいのかなーと、昨日見た人達を思い出して考えた。
-
オープンソースって、SIじゃなくてエンドユーザーこそそのメリットを享受できるのじゃないかなと思うのだよね。
自分で実際に使うシステムの中身までコントロールできるというのがオープンソースの最大のメリットなわけで、システムを作る人じゃなくて使う人こそオープンソースのメリットがあるのじゃないのかな。
そのためには、ユーザー企業が自前でプログラマを抱えている必要があって、それは、目指すべき理想ではないかと思う。現実はそれとは逆の方向に進んでいるような気がするけれど。
他の専門職との比較でいうと、弁護士に企業内弁護士がいたり、医師に産業医がいたりするように、企業内プログラマというのがいるべきで、そうなってこそオープンソースの本当のメリットが生まれるのではないかということ。
-
そういえば、最近はオープンソースに企業がバックにつくようになって結局オープンソースも企業のコントロールに入っちゃうのじゃないか的なことも言っている人がいたのですけれど、これも変な話。
だって、オープンなんだから、いくらでもそのプロセスに参加できるわけで、気に食わなければブランチしたっていいわけで、だからオープンソースにメリットがあるわけじゃないですか。
企業がバックについたからってそういう心配をする人は、結局企業でもコミュニティでも、自分以外の誰かが作ったものをそのまま利用しているだけでしかないわけで、オープンであろうがクローズドであろうがあまり変わりがないような気がします。
オープンソースなら大企業が入ってこないから、ニッチなビジネスとして成立していたという人からすれば、大企業が入ってくることで市場がとられるというのは分かる気がしますが、それはオープンソースとは関係ない話のような気がします。
Iran has described the incident as an " ordinary occurrence "
Both sets of footage
The voice on a Pentagon tape could instead have come from another ship in the area or a transmitter on land , senior US Navy sources told the BBC .
The US has sent Iran a formal protest over Sunday 's stand - off in the Strait of Hormuz .
Iran has accused the US of faking its video of the incident .
Conflicting accounts
Iranian state - run TV has broadcast a separate video of the stand - off , in which there is no sign of threatening behaviour by the Iranian patrols , thought to belong to the Revolutionary Guards .
I am coming at you - you will explode in a couple of minutes
Voice on US tape
Radio communications
The US military said video and audio that it released confirmed its allegation that Iranian speedboats harassed US warships and threatened to blow them up in a radio communication .
" I am coming at you .
You will explode in a couple of minutes , " the Iranians said in a radio transmission , according to US officials .
Pentagon officials said the speedboats came within about 200 m ( 650 ft ) of the US vessels .
US officials have described the actions of the speed boats as dangerous and provocative .
US sailors assumed battle stations and the captain on one of the ships was about to order an attack when the Iranian boats turned away , they said .
On Wednesday the US lodged a formal diplomatic complaint with the Iranian foreign ministry through the Swiss embassy in Tehran .
Doubts
The New York Times noted on Wednesday that the US - released audio includes no ambient noise of the kind that might be expected if the broadcast had come from on one of the speedboats .
Iran described the incident as a routine contact which happens all the time in the crowded waters of the Gulf .
The Pentagon has insisted that the three US vessels - identified as navy cruiser USS Port Royal , destroyer USS Hopper and frigate USS Ingraham - were in international waters .
The confrontation has further inflamed tensions between arch - foes Iran and the United States .
US President George W Bush is currently on a tour of the Middle East which will tackle what the Americans see as the threat posed by Iran to regional stability .

Mother Jones : Should the U.S. move to a soft partition plan and try to reduce the human suffering and bloodshed that accompanies that ?
Lt. Colonel John Nagl :
The Maliki government has to demonstrate that it is a government of all Iraq .
We are making great sacrifices to provide his government with the environment where they can make those difficult political choices .
We can continue to provide him with that breathing space , but it is coming at a great cost in dollars for the American taxpayer , great cost in lives in injured and killed American soldiers .
MJ : You ’ve been influential in developing an increased training advisory role .
JN : The Army has made great strides in how it selects and trains what they call transition teams , teams of combat advisers .
I have argued , and continue to argue , that this requirement for combat advisers is a lasting need .
This is not just our exit strategy both in Iraq and Afghanistan but is likely to remain an enduring requirement for the wars of the 21st century , and therefore the Army should develop a permanent advisory capacity .
My initial recommendation was for 20,000 soldiers configured in three divisions commanded by two - star generals with the overall effort led by a three - star lieutenant general , and I ’d call this the Army advisory corps .
I believe that if we had that capability today , we would use it ; we ’d employ it .
General Pace is on the record saying that we need more advisers in Afghanistan .
A number of studies have suggested that we need more American military advisers in Iraq , including the CNAS reports and the Iraq Study Group .
The Army currently does n’t have the capacity to provide all those advisers quickly or easily .
I believe that it should build that capacity in order to provide the United States with that capability , which would be an important capability for at least the next generation , or as long as the long war lasts .
MJ : What does the investment yield over time ?
JN : The most important contribution the United States would make to the long war will not be the fighting we do ourselves but the fighting our allies do .
It is almost impossible for an outside power to defeat an insurgency .
What an outside power can do is enable local forces to defeat a locally developed insurgency .
What adviser capability does is dramatically increase the effectiveness and responsiveness and also the respect for law and respect for human rights of those host nation security forces .
The counterinsurgency people get this .
But it has not won enthusiastic support from the leadership of the Army .
They believe that we should build additional brigade combat teams , conventional Army brigades with which we fight and win wars ourselves .
Increasingly in the 21st century , we ’ll be far more effective if we focus our resources on enabling our friends to win their wars themselves .
MJ : What do you do about our friends in Iraq when there is not emerging confidence that there is going to be a central Iraqi government security force ?
JN : In many of the countries challenged by insurgency , the most enduring and the most respected national institution is the army .
For that matter , the most respected institution in the United States is the army .
In many countries , the bedrock of the nation is an army and in many cases a multinational army .
I ’d be surprised if the most respected institution in Iraq were not the Iraqi Army .
The Iraqi people , like the American people , have great pride and increasingly great respect for and trust for the army .
That is especially true if army units are strengthened by the addition of American advisers .
So I ’d build the nation around the army in the same way we arguably built our nation around the Continental Army .
But the Iraqi Army needs a government that is worthy of the sacrifices it is making .
MJ : Do you worry about how hard it would be for the U.S. to get out given that under this administration it seems that we are probably going to stay big for a long time ?
JN : I believe it will be in the interests of the United States to ensure security and stability in Iraq for a very long time .
I personally believe that an expanded advisory effort would enable a drawdown of American combat troops , because an expanded advisory effort makes the Iraqi Army more capable , more responsive , more responsible .
MJ : There have been successes in the past few months with the Sunni sheikhs and tribes moving against Al Qaeda in Iraq and working more closely with Marines .
Are those Sunni militias ever something that you see joining the Iraqi National Army ?
JN : That depends entirely on political choices that still have to be made by the Iraqi government .
I ’m hopeful that the Maliki government will demonstrate that it wants to be a government of all Iraqi people , and one of the ways to do that is by incorporating these Sunni militias into one national Iraqi Army .
How the Maliki government chooses to do that and how the Sunni forces choose to respond will be important indicators of the extent to which the Maliki government is in fact perceived by the Iraqi people to be a government of all Iraq .
MJ : Are Maliki ’s shortcomings due to a just lack of political will on his part , or is some of that the great structural issues in Iraq that he ’s not controlling ?
JN : I think he is a politician and he ’s responsive to the political demands of his constituency just as any politician , and it is going to take real leadership to reach out to the Sunnis .
MJ : What would the expanded advisory effort teach Iraqi troops to do ?
JN : Everything from fire their rifles more accurately to plan and execute logistics to develop intelligence on insurgent forces and act on that intelligence to respect human rights to guard infrastructure and all the things we talk about in the counterinsurgency field manual that are things that American forces have to do .
But our counterinsurgent friends have to do them , too , the allies that we are enabling and advising .
And in support of that we ’ve translated the counterinsurgency field manual into Arabic .
It is the graduate level of war .
It is hard .
You have to call in air strikes , fire rifles , machine guns , and assist in economic reconstruction .
The opening quote of the field manual is “ Counterinsurgency is not just thinking man ’s warfare ; it is the graduate level of war . ”
MJ : Is the situation less problematic in Afghanistan because Afghanistan is more cohesive or is thought to have a more responsible central government ?
JN : I think the insurgency in Afghanistan is a less capable force than the insurgents in Iraq have proven to be .
It is a larger country , less densely populated .
The insurgency in Iraq has largely been an urban insurgency with attacks in the capital area , and hence widely publicized .
The insurgency in Afghanistan is a largely rural insurgency with its strengths in the tribal regions along the Afghanistan - Pakistan frontier .
But the same principles apply , and so we are mounting a very substantial effort to train and advise the Afghan military .
In the same way , we are training a higher quality soldier to be an adviser .
We ’ve established a pretty good training program .
I think that there is more we can do .
MJ : And that has to do with the U.S. Army ’s structural incentive system ?
JN : We have to decide what the future of warfare is going to be .
If it is going to continue to be these kinds of insurgencies where arguably our most effective contribution is in assisting local forces to fight the insurgency , then the Army should probably consider developing a permanent advisory structure .
MJ : How visible or invisible should the U.S. presence in such an advisory capacity be ?
In the case of Pakistan , where it can be an irritant to the population , should it be more invisible ?
JN : Remember the great Lawrence of Arabia quotation , “ Do not try to do too much with your own hands . ”
The less visible the American presence is , the better .
The more credit that is given to the host nation government , the host nation security forces , the better .
The more capable those forces are , the more capable the government is , the sooner we can go home .
The government 's decision not to ban smacking in England was criticised by the Children 's Commissioner for England , Sir Al Aynsley - Green , today .
Ministers rejected calls for a complete ban after a government review found opposition to such a move , the Department for Children , Schools and Families said .
But Sir
Al said the government had missed an opportunity to protect children from violence in the home .
" Children and young people should have the same right to protection under the law on common assault as that afforded to adults , " he said .
He added : " There is no good reason why children are the only people in the UK who can still be lawfully hit .
They are protected from assault in most other settings .
" By not changing the legislation , we continue to send out confusing messages to parents about the acceptable use of violence across society .
" Children themselves told the government that there were more effective methods such as restricting access to toys and television , " said the commissioner , who said he would continue to press for a change in the law .
" From the government 's own research , we 're beginning to see a sea change in attitude from younger parents and children away from smacking towards positive parenting techniques , " Sir Al said .
The children 's minister , Kevin Brennan , said the evidence was that fewer parents now use smacking to discipline their children .
In a statement to MPs , he said : " Whilst many parents say they will not smack , a majority of parents say that smacking should not be banned outright .
" The government will retain the law in its current form , in the absence of evidence it is not working satisfactorily . "
A complete ban was hotly debated in Scotland , but the Scottish executive stopped short of an outright ban on smacking in 2003 , settling for prohibiting punishment with implements like belts or slippers .
In England and Wales adults who smack children so hard it leaves a mark face up to five years in jail under the 2004 Children 's Act .
At the time , ministers promised to review the law to assess whether it was working .
Section 58 of the Act removed the defence of reasonable punishment from parents and adults acting " in loco parentis " who are charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm , wounding or grievous bodily harm , or cruelty to a child .
Mr Brennan said : " The review found that smacking is becoming a less commonly used form of discipline as more parents recognise that there are more effective and acceptable methods of disciplining children . "
The minister said many organisations supported legislation to ban smacking , but insisted that section 58 had improved protection for children .
" The police have discretion to deal with cases as they consider appropriate , taking into account factors including the evidence available , the public interest and the best interests of the child .
" But there appears to be a lack of awareness across different audiences about the scope and application of the law , " added Mr Brennan .
The Conservative children 's spokesman , Tim Loughton , called the decision a " clear victory for common sense " .
" Clearly , if any adult is responsible for abuse and violence towards a child they need to face the full rigour of the law .
But there is a world of difference between that and criminalising loving parents that use chastisement as they see fit in the interest of their child , " he said .
But Dame Mary Marsh , chief executive of children 's charity NSPCC , said there was " no place for physical punishment of children " .
She went on : " We do not agree with the government 's view that the law is working effectively .
Section 58 has not improved protection for children .
" We will continue to campaign for legal reform that will give children equal legal protection from assault as adults .
The NSPCC is committed to helping parents find alternatives to physical punishment , " she said .
Assassin ’s Creed PC to Have Insane Minimum Specs
Not that we were expecting anything less .
Tipster Brendan eyed the listing on Ubisoft ’s support knowledge base .
If you ’re too tired to click through , we ’ve replicated it here for the woozy :
Supported OS : Windows XP / Vista ( only )
Processor : Dual core processor 2.6 GHz Intel Pentium D or AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800 + ( Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400 + or better recommended )
RAM : 2 GB ( 3 GB recommended )
Video Card : 256 MB DirectX 10.0 – compliant video card or DirectX 9.0 – compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher ( 512 MB video card recommended ) ( see supported list ) *
Sound Card : DirectX 9.0 or 10.0 compliant sound card ( 5.1 sound card recommended )
DirectX Version : DirectX 10.0 libraries ( included on disc )
DVD - ROM : DVD -ROM dual - layer drive
Hard Drive Space : 12 GB
These specifications are neck - and - neck with Crysis ‘ minimums , even a bit beefier in some respects .
If the performance of Crytek ’s FPS on sub - standard hardware is anything to go by , Assassin ’s Creed on PC will chug on a system with the aforementioned capabilities .
Actually , I would n’t be surprised if it started running in reverse , or simply imploded from the strain .
As always , buyer beware .
If you have the option , it might be cheaper to buy an Xbox 360 and the game than to upgrade your PC to play it at speeds above 30 fps .
What are the minimum system requirements for Assassin ’s Creed ?

Fashion tips for women from a guy
who knows dick about fashion .
Before I begin , I should warn you that I know dick about fashion .
It 's not just a clever title to get your attention , though it 's admittedly clever ( I 'm honest enough to admit when something is brilliant , even when it 's my own writing ) .
You should n't read this article if you 're a woman with low self - esteem .
I do n't need my inbox filled with emails from teary - eyed women reaffirming how astute my observations are by shrieking at me for ruining their lives .
Women get away with murder in our society , especially when it comes to the visual pollution they call fashion .
So I 'm going to do what few people — few men — have ever done by criticizing you .
Sure , you may be thinking " but Maddox , people criticize women 's fashion all the time ! "
Yes , but not men , and definitely not badasses like me ....
Until now .
This makes you look pregnant :
I do n't know what this style is called since every retailer comes up with their own " clever " name for it , so I 'm just going to call them tit curtains because they look like curtains draped over your tits .
You might as well be wearing a burka .
It 's one giant formless piece of cloth draped around your waist .
There 's a reason pregnant women wear clothes like this , and it's because it usually looks good on them in lieu of a beekeeper outfit .
You 're not pregnant , so cut that shit out .
What boggles my mind about tit curtains is that it 's becoming trendy , right up there with Castro hats .
I do n't get it .
If I had boobs , the last thing I 'd want to do with them is cover them up with curtains , though I 'd probably eventually cover them with curtains when I 'd exhausted everything else ( oil , soap , other boobs , my hands , the lid of a photocopy machine , the mouths of other lesbians , etc ) .
Quit disrespecting your chest hams .
Crocs look like shit and they make your feet smell .
When I see people wearing Crocs , I know immediately that we have nothing in common , and that we could never be friends or have any meaningful kind of relationship .
They come in every color imaginable yet look bad with every other article of clothing ever created .
The only thing that goes with Crocs is social ostracism .
To their credit though , Crocs serve as an excellent idiot barometer ; you can tell a lot about people wearing them .
For example , Amazon.com suggest products that other customers have purchased based on the item you 're shopping for .
Here are the suggestions for Crocs :
When it comes to shoes , there are usually three deciding factors : quality , price , and style .
Some shoes are cheap and stylish , but poor quality , while others are stylish and durable , but expensive .
Crocs usually go for $ 30 - $ 60 , which does n't sound like much for a shoe , until you consider that what you 're really paying for are melted pellets squirted into a cast - iron mold in some province in China .
Crocs have the rare combination of being expensive , poor quality , and ugly .
It 's quite a feat for one shoe to suck this bad .
People who wear Crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are , and how it 's supposedly odor resistant because it 's made out of some kind of anti-bacterial foam .
Great point , dipshits !
You know what else it 's resistant to ?
You getting laid .
Then as if the shoes were n't disgusting enough , Crocs introduced a product called " Crocs butter " that 's supposed to restore that illustrious injection - molded sheen to those gaping holes they call shoes :
You know that feeling you get when you 're full and slightly nauseous and you burp and you can taste the partly digested food in the back of your throat ?
There is n't a word in the english language to succinctly describe it , but I will hereby refer to it as : croc-butter .
Red lipstick makes you look like a clown :
There are very few people who look good in red lipstick , and those people usually juggle for a living .
I once met a girl who was able to pull it off , so I let her buy me dinner .
Later that night she was making out with my wang , when I realized that all that lipstick was rubbing off .
So I evacuated my moan - maker from her face hole , took some silverware for my trouble , and snuck out of her tent .
Red lipstick looks horrible on most women , and all men .
The bright crimson hue is an unnatural abomination pushed upon your face by cynical cosmetic industry scientists .
I 'm sure somewhere in a laboratory , two scientists are high - fiving each other , laughing at all the bullshit new names for shades of red they invent .
There have been literally thousands of names for the same color of lipstick over the years , yet there are only about 3 shades of red : red , dark red , light red .
Period .
And I mean that grammatically , and not menstrually , though the context makes sense now that I think about it .
They just make up names as they go along , and you idiots keep buying the same three shades of red over and over again :
Here are some actual names for shades of red lipstick : berry juicy , candied apple , midnight red , love that red , volcanic red , red velvet , red reinvented , cherry desirable , opulent garnet , royal red , etc , etc .
You know they 're just making shit up when they start using abstract concepts like " love " and " desirable " in the name .
Most of the shades are indiscernible from each other , but women insist that there 's a difference .
So I went to Revlon 's website and took two of these colors for a comparison :
Yes , these are actual Revlon lipstick colors .
I 'm not making this up .
Insecure women with boring faces lap this shit up because they think " hmmm .. what does my face need ?
Oh , I know !
A giant hokey shade of red that is n't even found in nature . "
You are not a Cuban dictator .
Fidel Castro hats were made to be worn by Fidel Castro .
Not hipster losers trying to look ironic .
Unless you have a beard and you led a coup in 1959 to establish a Marxist socialist state in Cuba , take it the fuck off .
It would n't even be so bad if you were Cuban , but you 're not .
You live in a midwestern suburb and you shop at Hollister .
Oh yeah , that reminds me of this store I hate called Hollister .
It 's the greatest cultural fraud perpetrated upon mankind , and it looks like this :
Did you think your Hollister store was unique ?
" But Maddox , how did you get a picture of that distinctive looking store from my mall ? "
Surprised ?
That 's because every Hollister store is exactly the same :
Hollister : uniquely mass produced .
The store is made to look unique when it's not , so what you think you 're seeing is a clothing store , but what you 're actually seeing is a lie .
Every store has the same fake facade with the same fake plants out front , with the same fake terracotta roof , and every store plays the same pop / punk / emo soundtrack .
Everything in this store is engineered to create a fake image , right down to the way the store smells .
Think that musky cologne you smell when you walk by the store is an accident ?
Some marketing dickwad was paid top dollar to make you have an involuntary brand association every time you smell that scent .
All so they can sell you a hat popularized by a Cuban dictator for the low low price of $ 20 .
Choke it down , dipshits !
Self - aggrandizing " hottie " shirts make you look like a bitch :
There are two types of girls who buy these shirts : 13 - year - old junior - high brats , and 29 - year - old chicks who are too tan and wear way too much lip gloss , and try desperately to look like they 're younger than 29 .
The real problem here is that women who wear these shirts start to believe their own bullshit after a while .
The shirt at the top emblazoned with the phrase " you say I 'm a bitch like it 's a bad thing " epitomises this attitude .
Guess what ?
It is a bad thing .
Here is my unabridged definition of bitch :
Noun : Bitch ( bich ) : A miserable person who sucks all joy and happiness out of life , and makes life a little less worth living by her consistently shitty attitude .
When not complaining , her drama and gossip will fill the void .
He or she ( but usually she ) refuses to do something with a group , and will forego hanging out with said group unless they 're doing something she wants to do .
She will put her interest ahead of others every single time , just for the sake of being a bitch .
A bitch hates fun .
" Hey guys , sorry we can't check out that cool new Brazilian restaurant , Mike is being a bitch . "
A status you assume when you take one in the pooper while incarcerated .
What you become when you fail at pool , bowling , Quake , english , math , Street Fighter Alpha , etc .
Having a thankless job where you work lots of overtime without pay while your boss is on vacation .
Having to sit in the middle seat between two people in a car or plane .
Being last in line to get cake or ice cream at a party .
Crying and throwing a tantrum about something nobody gives a shit about , including you .
" I 'm not going to give you $ 6 for my share of an $ 11 pizza when all I owe you is $ 5.50 .
I should n't have to pay extra , waaaaaah ! "
Having a high opinion of your looks and a sense of entitlement when people compliment you .
Your ego is usually punctuated with a " hottie " shirt , which makes you slightly less tolerable to be around than children , and slightly more tolerable to be around than a saucer of goat cum .
Nothing screams " bitch " like wearing a shirt that says " too hot to care . "
Frankly , there 's only one person in the world who's hot enough to wear a shirt like that , and her name is Maddilox :
“ Ghost bikes , ” riderless and painted white , were placed at two busy intersections in Portland , Ore. , last October , makeshift memorials to two bicyclists killed when they were hit by trucks in accidents that month .
This spring , at those same intersections and at 12 others across the city , “ bike boxes ” will be laid out on the roadway to provide a clearly designated place for cyclists , in front of and in full view of drivers , to wait for traffic lights to change .
The boxes will be marked with signs and wide stripes alerting drivers to stop behind them at red lights .
Portland , which has a higher percentage of people who bike to work than any other large American city , is already considered one of the country ’s most bike - friendly urban centers .
But the boxes , believed to be the first such to be put to use by any city in the country , will make cyclists even safer and more comfortable on the street , biking advocates and transportation officials say .
“ It ’s something the city has been talking about for a long time , but these two deaths have certainly given an added sense of urgency , ” said Jonathan Maus , whose bikeportland.org is a focal point for Portland cyclists .
“ The community has just made it so clear that this is very important , that they ’re very concerned following these fatal crashes that things need to change . ”
